<text>Kingdom Identity Ministries (KIM) is a self-described &quot;outreach ministry&quot; based in Harrison, Arkansas, which advocates racism, antisemitism, and extreme homophobia. Its website states that it &quot;is an outreach ministry to God&#x27;s chosen race&quot; by which it means &quot;the White, European peoples&quot; whom it calls the &quot;true Israel&quot;. It adheres to the white supremacist theology which is known as Christian Identity. The Southern Poverty Law Center considers it &quot;the largest supplier in existence of materials related to Christian Identity&quot;.

It primarily functions as a distributor of books, tracts, and audiotapes about Christian identity and offers correspondence courses through its American Institute of Theology. KIM also produces the &quot;Herald of Truth&quot; radio program which is broadcast on shortwave, satellite, and Internet radio. In addition to Christian Identity material, KIM also circulates other white supremacist material. For example, it sends white supremacist pamphlets to rural communities in Pennsylvania and it funded the distribution of a white power music CD in 2007.

KIM was founded in 1982 by Mike Hallimore and it currently owns the copyright to a number of works on Christian Identity by Bertrand Comparet and Wesley Swift. Hallimore died on July 10, 2021, at his home in Alpena at age 74.

<text>The National League System comprises the six levels of the English football league system immediately below the level of the English Football League. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Football Association. The National League System has a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels. For details of leagues above and below the National League System, see the English football league system.

The system underwent a rearrangement from 2004 to 2008 and was rearranged again in 2018. Phase one went into operation in 2004–05. At the start of the 2006–07 season, phase two was introduced, and a further phase three started from 2007–08 with the starting of a second Step 4 league in the north of England. Phase four took effect in 2018–19. Ahead of the 2020-21 season, Step 7 was abolished, being replaced by feeder leagues overseen by local county FAs.

==Organisation==

At the top of the National League System pyramid is the National League. Its top division, also called the National League (currently called the Vanarama National League), is the only division in the System which is organised on a national rather than regional basis. Although the National League is the top level of the non-league pyramid, it is not the highest level of English football (it is actually the fifth overall division). The Premier League and the three divisions of the English Football League (EFL) comprise the top 92 clubs in the English game; each season, two teams from the National League achieve promotion to the English Football League. Some leagues have more than one division. At the lower levels the existence of leagues becomes intermittent, although in some areas there are as many as twenty layers.

All the leagues are bound together by the principle of promotion and relegation. Clubs that are successful in their league can rise higher in the pyramid, whilst those that finish at the bottom can find themselves sinking further down. In theory it is possible for a lowly local amateur club to rise to the pinnacle of the English game and become champions of the Premier League. While this may be unlikely in practice, there certainly is significant movement within the pyramid. The number of teams promoted between leagues or divisions varies, and promotion is usually contingent on meeting criteria set by the higher league, especially concerning appropriate facilities and finances.
In particular, clubs that hope to be promoted from Step 5 leagues to Step 4 must apply in advance to be assessed for whether they meet the grading requirements. The teams must then also finish in the top 3 in their league to be considered for promotion, which is not automatic. For instance, in the 2005–06 season 100 clubs applied to be considered for promotion, of which 51 met the grading requirements, and 29 of those finished in the top 3 in their leagues. With an additional division commencing at Step 4 in 2006–07, all 29 clubs had their promotions accepted.

Under the direction of The Football Association, the National League System evolved over many years. Today&#x27;s pyramid can be said to be barely twenty years old. Leagues have formed and dissolved over the years and reorganisations have taken place every few years as a result. Beginning with the 2004–05 season, Phase One of the latest change was introduced with the formation of a Conference North and Conference South immediately below the Football Conference, renamed Conference Premier, dropping the top divisions of the Southern League, Isthmian League, and Northern Premier League down one level. The Conference North and South have since been renamed the National League North and South.

==The system==
This table includes the six steps of the National League System (NLS). Above the NLS are the Premier League and the English Football League. Two teams from the National League can be promoted to EFL League Two at the end of each season. This structure was the result of changes made after the 2005–06 season.

The official name is given for all the leagues listed, and the sponsorship name is also provided for the leagues in the top four steps. All divisions in the top four steps have 20 to 24 clubs each. The FA&#x27;s National League System Committee determine promotion and relegation between leagues shown, mainly based on location. The NLS Committee also has the power to transfer clubs between divisions and even leagues at the same level of the pyramid should this be deemed necessary to maintain geographically practical and numerically balanced divisions and leagues at every level.

All clubs in the NLS are eligible to compete in the FA Cup, but are seeded into it according to Step standing. Step 1 to 4 clubs are eligible for the FA Trophy and Step 5 to 6 clubs (and some at NLS Feeder League level) for the FA Vase, as well as their respective regional league cups and county cups.

==History==
For the 2012–13 season, the FA announced a re-structuring of the National League System&#x27;s lowest level, Step 7. It was split into three sub-categories, which were full Step 7 divisions, Step 7A and Step 7B. The categorisation depended on the ground facilities of the particular league&#x27;s clubs. The required percentage of clubs to meet ground grade requirements for each of the categorisations were as follows:
* Step 7: 100%;
* Step 7A: 75%; and
* Step 7B: 60%.
Step 7 – was awarded to leagues where 100% of their clubs met the Step 7 minimum ground grading requirements on 31 March and the league complies with all other requirements for Step 7 status.

Step 7A – was awarded to leagues where 75% or more of their clubs met the Step 7 minimum ground grading requirements after 31 March and the league complied with all other requirements for Step 7 status. (It was noted that in the 2011–12 season these leagues were referred to as provisional.)

Step 7B – was awarded to leagues where 60% or more of their clubs met the ground grading requirements after 31 March and the league complied with all other requirements for Step 7 status.

The sub-categories were removed in the 2016–17 season. In 2020–21, Step 7 was abolished altogether, with former leagues at this step instead being designated NLS Feeder Leagues, organised by county FAs.
In March 2018, representatives of the National League system confirmed that a pure pyramid in a 1-2-4-8-16 was the goal. This meant the introduction of an eighth division at Step 4 and two further divisions at Step 5. The comments were made just prior to the introduction of the fourth division at Step 3 and the seventh at Step 4. On 17 April 2019, it was clarified that there would be 17 divisions at Step 6, down from 19 in 2018–19 and that the two new divisions at Step 5 would be in the Midlands and the west London/Thames Valley areas. On 24 April, it was announced that the Northern Premier League had been awarded the operation of the eighth division at Step 4. Initially scheduled for implementation in 2020–21, but due to the coronavirus disease pandemic in England which prematurely ended the remainder of the 2019–20 season for leagues at Steps 3 to 6 on 26 March 2020, the FA postponed it to the 2021–22 season when football leagues from Step 2 below had their seasons curtailed again by restrictions from COVID-19 lockdowns on 24 February 2021. The two Step 5 divisions are administered by the Combined Counties and United Counties leagues.

<doc id="563348" wikidata="Q1857154" url="?curid=563348" title="Maserati Bora">
<text>The Maserati Bora (Tipo AM117) is a two-seat, rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car and grand tourer, manufactured by Maserati from 1971 to 1978. In common with other Maserati cars of the era, it is named after a wind, Bora being the wind of Trieste. The Bora was the company&#x27;s first mid-engined street car and ended Maserati&#x27;s reputation for producing fast but technologically out of date cars, also being the first Maserati with four wheel independent suspension. In contrast, competitor Lamborghini had first used full independent suspension in 1964. The Bora was the second-most expensive car of the 1970s following Lamborghini Countach.

==History==
Shortly after Citroën took a controlling interest in Maserati in 1968, the concept of a mid-engined two-seat sports car was proposed. Lamborghini and De Tomaso already had the Miura and Mangusta, whilst Ferrari were known to be developing their own mid-engined contender. Initially known as Tipo 117 and later the Bora, the Maserati project got underway in October 1968 and a prototype was on the road by mid-1969. Shown in its final form at the Geneva Salon in March 1971, deliveries began before the end of the year. Maserati struggled after being bought by De Tomaso in 1975, and the Bora was discontinued during 1978. 564 Boras were produced in total, of which 275 were fitted with 4.9-litre engines and the other 289 were fitted with 4.7-litre engines.

The first Boras were delivered to customers in late 1971, and only minor production changes were gradually phased in thereafter. About early 1974, front lids became hinged at front instead of rear, pop-up headlights showed rounded inside corners, and a rectangular black air-exit grille was added across the hood (similar to Pantera). Production ran from 1971 to 1978, with 564 cars built, 289 of which were 4.7s and the remaining 275 being 4.9s.

The Bora provided the basis for the Merak, which used the same bodyshell front clip but in a 2+2 configuration, made possible by using a smaller, lighter and less powerful Maserati V6 engine, also used in the Citroën SM. The Merak was popular, including the later modified and improved Merak SS which made its debut in 1981. Merak models had an opened rear engine-cover instead of the glass-enclosed and heavier cover of the Bora.

Maserati developed two Group 4 racing cars at the request of Thepenier, a French Maserati dealer. They were tuned to produce and were fully competitive, but Maserati couldn&#x27;t produce enough cars to meet the 500 road car homologation rule for Group 4 racing so the project was shelved.

==Design and innovations==
The Bora was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign in the late 1960s, and came to market in 1971, sporting a drag coefficient of just 0.30. a value that would still be called very aerodynamic, a decade later. Fabrication of the all-steel panels was contracted to Officine Padane of Modena.

The Bora had a number of innovative features that distinguished the car both from previous Maserati&#x27;s, as well as other leading brand supercars. Compared to those, it was civilized and practical, featuring a hydraulically powered pedal cluster that could be moved forward and backwards at the touch of a button and a steering wheel that could be tilted as well as telescoped, addressing the familiar problem of entering and exiting the vehicle typical of many supercars.

Most supercars offer little foot room and little to no provision for luggage, but the Bora has a full-size trunk in the front of the vehicle, and was otherwise known as being much more civilized in comforts from its competitors. Unlike its competitors, the Bora used dual-pane insulative glazing separating its cabin from the engine compartment, as well as a carpeted aluminium engine cap, greatly decreasing the powertrain&#x27;s transmission of noise, harshness and vibration to the cabin, and increasing the comfort level for the driver. The engine and five-speed ZF transaxle were mounted on a subframe attached to the floor pan via four flexible mounts, 

== Specifications ==
The original engine is a high-revving producing at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,200 rpm. The US-bound Bora had larger 4.9-litre engine from the Ghibli as to compensate for the reduced power due to the exhaust emission regulations. In 1976, Maserati switched to the larger 4.9-litre engine with a 8.75 to 1 compression ratio, rated at at 5,500 rpm and at 4,000 rpm for markets outside of the United States. Both engines trace their lineage back to the famous 450S racecar, were made of aluminium alloy and had hemispherical combustion chambers with 16 valves total operated by four cams (chain-driven). Both engines were mounted longitudinally in the middle of the car and were mated to a ZF-1 five-speed transaxle sending power to the rear wheels. They were fed by four 42 DCNF/14 downdraught Weber carburetors with Bosch electronic ignition. The compression ratio is 8.5:1. 

The most distinctive details of the Bora were the brushed stainless steel roof and windscreen pillars. Inside, the bucket seats, dash, door trim, centre console and rear bulkhead were trimmed in leather, with electric windows and air conditioning as standard. The steering column was manually adjustable for rake and reach. The auxiliary hydraulic circuit system controls adjusted the driver&#x27;s seat vertically, the pedal box (consisting of the brake, clutch and throttle pedals) can be set horizontally forwards and backwards by around – a first such application in the world for a production car, and also to raise and lower the concealed headlights in the front fenders.

===US models===
The larger 4.9-litre V8 engine from the US-bound Ghibli produced at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,200 rpm. From 1973 on, the engine was fitted with air pump as to decrease the exhaust emissions, and its output was increased to at 6,000 rpm.

Larger, beefier bumpers were fitted to the US-bound cars as to comply with bumper standards, though many Bora owners in the United States and Canada have subsequently replaced them with the smaller, thinner bumpers for European and international markets.

The colour of turn signal indicators on the taillamps was changed from amber to red for the US and Canadian market.

===Chassis===
The original estimated weight was , however, noise and safety concerns increased the weight to . It is popularly believed that the Bora is heavier than the Ghibli; however, the Ghibli weighs , some more than the Bora. The reason for this misconception probably stems from the state of tune of their respective engines as well as the difference in the gearing of the two cars.

A combined steel monocoque chassis and body featured a tubular steel subframe at the back for the engine and transmission. Bora also featured four-wheel independent suspension (a first for a Maserati passenger car) with coil springs, telescopic suspension dampers, and anti-roll bars. The development prototype and the similar show car first seen at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show featured the front suspension using MacPherson struts, but this was abandoned for the production version due to the severe drivability issue. Using MacPherson struts in combination with very wide front tyres and rack-and-pinion steering system produced stronger and undesirable kickback. For the production cars, Maserati reverted to a conventional wishbone arrangement for the front suspension.

Citroën&#x27;s advanced high-pressure LHM hydraulic technology was adapted into two circuit systems: main and auxiliary. The main controls the ventilated disc brakes while the auxiliary operates the horizontal and vertical movements of the pedal box (clutch, brake, and throttle), the vertical adjustments of the driver&#x27;s seat, and the raising and lowering of the retractable headlights. Wheels were Campagnolo light alloy type with distinctive removable polished stainless steel hubcaps in the earlier models. Tyres were Michelin XWX 205x70 front and rear, however these early cars exhibited problems with &quot;tramlining&quot; at speed. To solve this problem Maserati fitted later cars with 215/70VR15 tyres on the rear, with the choice of Michelin XWX or Pirelli Cinturato CN12 tyres.

The official Maserati website quotes a top speed of for the Bora 4.7 and for the Bora 4.9, although many sources give differing top speeds.

<text>LaPorte Church of Christ is an independent church in Laporte, Colorado, led by Peter J. Peters (November 13, 1946 – July 7, 2011) from 1977 until his death. 

== History ==
After completing study at the Church of Christ Bible Training School in Gehring, Nebraska, Peters began preaching as a minister for the Church of Christ. In 1977, he went to the LaPorte Church of Christ. The church was unable to support him full time, so he also worked for the US Department of Agriculture, as he also held degrees in agri-business and economics. This was during the farm crisis of the 1980s and Peters witnessed many farmers who lost everything. During this time, Peters converted to Christian Identity as a result of listening to radio sermons by Identity minister Sheldon Emry. This caused Peters to lose all but five of the original congregants of LaPorte Church of Christ.

The church served mainly as a platform for Peters&#x27;s views and its membership never went above 100. It attracted white supremacists, including the members of the terrorist organization The Order who murdered radio talk show host Alan Berg with whom Peters had clashed on Berg&#x27;s radio program.

The church became involved in a controversy in Colorado, related to an amendment against homosexuality, which led to it being fined for a minor violation of election laws. Peters refused to pay the fine and the church was seized by the state in February 1993 as the debt exceeded $10,000.

LaPorte operates Scriptures for America, a shortwave radio service that broadcasts via WTWW in Lebanon, Tennessee. Peters&#x27;s programming had previously been carried on WRNO and WWCR.

== Beliefs ==
Peters proclaimed that Europeans are the true Israel and that contemporary Jews may be of the synagogue of Satan (based on and ) and the descendants of the biblical Esau (Edom), the brother and nemesis of Jacob (Israel). Critics labeled his message to be that of Christian Identity, although he rejected this label. The church is no longer associated with the decentralized group of churches that use the name &quot;Churches of Christ&quot;.

<text>Stanley Middleton FRSL (1 August 1919 – 25 July 2009) was a British novelist.

==Life==
He was born in Bulwell, Nottinghamshire, in 1919 and educated at High Pavement School, Stanley Road, Nottingham, and later at University College Nottingham.

Middleton started writing while at university and in 1958 published &quot;A Short Answer&quot;. Alongside his work as an author, he taught English at High Pavement Grammar School for many years. In 1974, his novel &quot;Holiday&quot; won the Booker Prize. In 2008, &quot;Her Three Wise Men&quot; was published, his 44th novel and the last to be published during his lifetime.

Middleton was an accomplished organist, playing regularly at St Mark&#x27;s Methodist Church on Ravensworth Road in Bulwell and stepping in to cover others, often at Mansfield Road Baptist Church in Nottingham. He was also a fine watercolourist and contributed his own artwork to the covers of the 1994 novel &quot;Catalysts&quot; and the festschrift &quot;Stanley Middleton At Eighty&quot;.

In 2006, a reporter for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; sent the first chapters of &quot;Holiday&quot; to a number of publishers and literary agents as a journalistic stunt. Almost all rejected it.

The actor Peter Bowles was taught by Middleton while a pupil at High Pavement. In 1980 when Bowles was the subject of the popular TV programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, Middleton appeared as a guest on the programme.

Middleton was married to Margaret Welch from 1951 until his death; the couple had two daughters, Penny and Sarah. Towards the end of his life, he suffered from cancer, and died in a nursing home on 25 July 2009, at age 89.

It has been revealed that Middleton refused an OBE in 1979. This came to light following a freedom of information request by the BBC. He did not feel that he should be honoured simply for doing what he regarded as his job.

<text>The Ferrari Testarossa (Type F110) is a 12-cylinder mid-engine sports car manufactured by Ferrari, which went into production in 1984 as the successor to the Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer. The Pininfarina-designed car was originally produced from 1984 until 1991, with two model revisions following the end of Testarossa production called the 512 TR and F512 M, which were produced from 1992 until 1996. Including revised variations, almost 10,000 cars in total were produced, making it at the time one of the most mass-produced Ferrari models.

The Testarossa is a two-door coupé that premiered at the 1984 Paris Auto Show. All versions of the Testarossa were available with a rear-mounted, five-speed manual transmission. The rear mid-engine design (engine between the axles but behind the cabin) keeps the centre of gravity in the middle of the car, which increases stability and improves the car&#x27;s cornering ability, and thus results in a standing weight distribution of 40% front: 60% rear.

The original Testarossa was re-engineered for the 1992 model year and was introduced as the 512 TR (TR meaning TestaRossa), at the Los Angeles Auto Show, effectively as a completely new car, and an improved weight distribution of 41% front, 59% rear. Another new variant called the F512 M was introduced at the 1994 Paris Auto Show. The car dropped the &quot;TR&quot; initials and added the &quot;M&quot; which in Italian stood for &quot;modificata&quot;, or translated to modified, and was the final version of the Testarossa, which continued its predecessor&#x27;s weight distribution improvement of 42% front, 58% rear. The F512 M was Ferrari&#x27;s last vehicle that featured the flat-12 engine.

The Testarossa is a recognized cultural icon of the 1980s, and was popularized by media including the 1984 television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (from the 1986 season onward) and Sega&#x27;s 1986 video game &quot;Out Run&quot;.

==Development==
The Testarossa traces its roots back to the faults of the 1981 512 BBi. The problems that the Testarossa was conceived to fix included a cabin that got increasingly hot from the indoor plumbing that ran between the front-mounted radiator and the midships-mounted engine and a lack of luggage space. To fix these problems the Testarossa was designed to be larger than its predecessor. For instance, at wide, the Testarossa was half a foot wider than the Boxer. This resulted in an increased wheelbase that stretched about to , which was used to accommodate luggage in a carpeted storage space under the front forward-opening hood. The increase in length created extra storage space behind the seats in the cabin. Headroom was also increased with a roofline half an inch taller than the Boxer.

The design came from Pininfarina. The design team at Pininfarina consisted of Ian Cameron, Guido Campoli, Diego Ottina and Emanuele Nicosia. They were led by design chief Leonardo Fioravanti, who also designed many other contemporary Ferrari models. The design was originated by Nicosia, but the guidance of Fioravanti was equally important. Being trained in aerodynamics, Fioravanti applied his know-how to set the layout of the car. The designers were originally trying to minimize the necessary side intakes, which also could not be left open due to American safety legislation, but then decided on making them a statement of style instead - one that ended up becoming emblematic of the late eighties. The Testarossa did not need a rear spoiler. The aerodynamic drag coefficient of was significantly lower than the Lamborghini Countach&#x27;s 0.42.

The styling was a departure from the curvaceous boxer—one which caused some controversy. The side strakes sometimes referred to as &quot;cheese graters&quot; or &quot;egg slicers,&quot; that spanned from the doors to the rear fenders were needed for rules in several countries outlawing large openings on cars. Unlike the Berlinetta Boxer, the Testarossa had twin side radiators near the engine at the rear instead of a single radiator up-front - eliminating much piping and allowing for a much cooler cabin. After passing through the engine bay, the cooling air exited through the vents at the engine lid and the tail. The strakes also made the Testarossa wider at the rear than at the front, thus increasing stability and handling.

One last unique addition to the new design was a single high mounted side view mirror on the driver&#x27;s side. On US-based cars, the mirror was lowered to a more normal placement for the 1987 model year and was quickly joined by a passenger side view mirror for the driver to be able to make safe lane changes.
The &quot;Testarossa&quot; name pays homage to the famed 1957 World Sportscar Championship-winning 250 Testa Rossa sports racing car. &quot;Testa Rossa&quot;, which literally means &quot;red head&quot; in Italian, refers to the red-painted cam covers sported by both cars&#x27; 12-cylinder engines.

Like its predecessor, the Testarossa used double wishbone front and rear suspension systems. Ferrari improved traction by adding 10-inch-wide alloy rear wheels. The Testarossa&#x27;s drivetrain was also an evolution of the 512 BBi. Its engine used near identical displacement and compression ratio, but unlike the 512 BBi had four-valve cylinder heads that were finished in red.
==Testarossa==
===Engine===
The Testarossa has a naturally aspirated longitudinally-mounted, &quot;Tipo F113&quot; flat-12 engine. The engine has DOHC 4 valves per cylinder (48 valves in total) and is lubricated via a dry sump system. The engine has a compression ratio of 9.30:1. These combine to provide a maximum power of at 6,300 rpm and maximum torque of at 4,500 rpm. Early U.S. versions of the car had the same engine, but had slightly less power, which stood at .

The Testarossa can accelerate from 0– in 5.8 seconds and on to in 11.4 seconds (though Motor Trend Magazine managed 5.29 seconds to 60 mph and 11.3 seconds, respectively). It can complete a standing (from stationary) quarter mile ~ in 13.5 seconds and a standing kilometre in 23.8 seconds. The top speed of the Testarossa is estimated at .

=== Engine specifications ===
=== Wheels and suspension ===
When introduced for the 1985 model year, the Testarossa had magnesium single bolt &quot;knockoff&quot; wheels with a 16.33 inches (415 mm) diameter. These wheels used the Michelin TRX tyres having sizes of 240/45 VR 415 at the front and 280/45 VR 415 at the rear.

In the 1986 model year, the wheels kept the same design but were changed to a standard 16 inches (406 mm) diameter, with a width of 8 inches at the front and 10 inches at the rear. Goodyear Gatorback or Pirelli Cinturato P-Zero 225/50 VR 16 front tyres and 255/50 VR 16 rear tyres were fitted. However, for the US market the cars were delivered with the metric sized TRX wheels until the 1989 model year.

The rear suspension consisted of independent, unequal-length wishbones, coil springs, twin telescopic shock absorbers on each side, and an anti-roll bar. The entire drivetrain and suspension was designed to be removed as a unit from underneath the car so the engine and timing belts could be serviced.

In the mid of the 1988 model year, the suspension was redesigned and the wheels were changed again from the single bolt knockoff setup to the standard Ferrari five bolt pattern. The wheel design still resembled the ones installed at the Testarossa&#x27;s debut.

The front brakes have a diameter of and the rear brakes have a diameter of .

===Reception===
The car received a positive reception from the automotive press - it was featured on the cover of &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine 10 times from December 1984 through July 1989. It lost comparison tests to the Lamborghini Countach, Alpina B10 Bi-Turbo and BMW M5.

Well-known Testarossa owners included Elton John, Marti Pellow, Alain Delon, O. J. Simpson, Rod Stewart, Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson, John Carmack, Dr. Dre, M.C. Hammer, Austrian Formula One racing driver Gerhard Berger, and Gary Monsieur. Don Johnson, who famously drove a white Testarossa on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, was gifted a brand-new silver 1989 Testarossa by Enzo Ferrari himself, who was a fan of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Michael Mann, executive producer of the series, also had a custom painted, blue metallic Testarossa.

As Ferrari&#x27;s flagship model during the 1980s, the car made numerous appearances in pop culture, most notably in the arcade game &quot;Out Run&quot;, and in the third, fourth, and fifth seasons of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. The car has subsequently become synonymous with 1980s &quot;yuppies&quot; and is an icon of 1980s retro culture. Its signature side strakes have become a popular aftermarket body component for wide arch aesthetic body kits. The side strakes also spawned body kits that were designed for cars such as the Pontiac Fiero and the Mazda B-Series pickup trucks (these were referred to as &quot;Truxtarossa&quot; kits), in addition to a wide variety of Japanese and American sports cars and motorcycles such as the Honda VFR.
==512 TR==
===Engine===
The 512 TR sports a 4.9-litre () longitudinally rear-mounted &quot;Tipo F113 D&quot; flat-12 engine. Each cylinder of the engine has four valves, with forty-eight valves total. The engine is lubricated via a dry sump system, and has a compression ratio of 10.00:1. These combine to provide a maximum of at 5,500 rpm and a maximum power output of at 6,750 rpm.

The car can accelerate from 0– in 4.8 seconds and on to in 10.7 seconds. It can complete a standing (from stationary) quarter mile in 13.2 seconds or a standing kilometre in 23.4 seconds. The 512 TR has a top speed of .

A recall was issued in 1995, regarding fuel hose fitting issues. Over 400 cars had this defect which was caused by variances in temperature and environment. Another recall was issued in relation to the passive restraint system on seat belts not functioning properly, on over 2,000 cars. If the restraint system suffered a mechanical or electrical failure only the lap belt would provide safety to the occupant.

The 512 TR&#x27;s engine was extensively reworked. Nikasil liners were added, along with a new air intake system, Bosch engine management system, larger intake valves, and a revised exhaust system. In addition to the higher peak power, the modifications delivered a more broad power band for better acceleration.

Gearshifting effort, a prolonged complaint about the Testarossa, was eased with a new single-plate clutch, sliding ball bearings, and better angle for the gearshift knob. The braking system included larger cross-drilled front rotors. Quicker steering, lower-profile tyres, and new shock settings improved handling. Most importantly, engine and gearbox position was rethought, which improved the centre of gravity, aiding the handling and making the car easier to drive.

The interior also received updates, with the centre console split from the dashboard, and the climate controls relocated. Pietro Camardella at Pininfarina was tasked with redesigning the body of the car for better integration of the newly included spoilers and the new engine cover. The design was updated in line with the recently introduced 348.

===Wheels===
The 512 TR has wheels with a width of at the front and at the rear. The tyre for the front wheels are 235/40 ZR 18 and 295/35 ZR 18 for the rear. The front brakes have a diameter of and the rear brakes have a diameter of .

===Notable appearances===
The 512 TR is featured on the cover and in the 1994 arcade racing video game The Need For Speed.

==F512 M==

The F512 M was the last version of the Testarossa. 501 cars were produced in total, of which 75 were made for the North America market. It was first shown at the Paris Salon in October 1994 and the last car was built in early 1996. All United States models sold (none were sold new to Canada) were model year 1995. 75 right-hand drive cars were built.

===Engine===

The F512 M sports a 4.9-litre () &quot;Tipo F113 G&quot; longitudinally mid mounted flat-12 engine. This provides a maximum torque of at 5,500 rpm and a maximum power output of at 6,750 rpm. The engine features four valves per-cylinder, for forty-eight valves total and is lubricated via a dry sump system, with a compression ratio of 10.40:1. Due to new titanium connecting rods and a new crankshaft that together weighs less than those that they replace, the engine has a 7,500 rpm electronic rev limit.

The Ferrari F512 M can accelerate from 0 to in 4.7 seconds, on to in 10.2 seconds, and can complete a standing quarter mile in 12.7 seconds or a standing kilometre in 22.7 seconds. The F512 M has a top speed of .

The front and rear lamps received a design change. The pop-up headlamps were replaced by two fixed square units. The rear taillamps were round and the bumpers had been restyled to yield a more unified look. The car featured a different front lid with twin NACA ducts.

===Interior===
The F512 M&#x27;s interior received a minor update from the 512 TR. The gearshift knob had a chromed finish, the aluminum pedals were drilled, and air conditioning was now included as standard. Carbon fibre racing bucket seats were also available at no extra cost, weighing only ; much less than the standard seats. Pininfarina and Ferrari flags line the dash board.

===Wheels===
The F512 M has wheels with a width of for front and for the rears. The tyres are &quot;Pirelli P Zero&quot; units, with codes for the front wheels of 235/40 ZR 18 and 295/35 ZR 18 for the rear. The front brakes have a diameter of and the rear brakes have a diameter of .

===Testarossa Spider===

The Testarossa Spider (s/n 62897) is the sole official convertible variant of the Testarossa commissioned in 1986 by the then-Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli to commemorate his 20 years of chairmanship of the company. The Testarossa Spider has an Argento Nürburgring exterior, a white magnolia leather interior with a dark blue stripe running above the matte black sills, and a white electronically operated soft top that could be manually stowed away. The vehicle was delivered to Agnelli in four months, and had a solid silver Ferrari logo on the hood instead of an aluminium one. The silver theme refers to elemental silver&#x27;s periodic table abbreviation &quot;Ag&quot; (from the Latin &quot;&quot;), the first two letters of Agnelli&#x27;s name.

Despite many requests from interested customers for a Testarossa Spider, Ferrari refused to produce the car as a regular production variant of the Testarossa, citing spatial and structural challenges that would be difficult to resolve, and so Pininfarina and some aftermarket firms such as Straman, Pavesi, Lorentz and Rankl, and Koenig Specials offered unofficial Spider conversions on special consumer requests. The official Spider is no different mechanically from the normal Testarossa available on the European market. It has a standard 4.9 L flat-12 engine with a power output of . The only differences, other than being a convertible, are that the Spider&#x27;s front window and door windows are both shorter than those of the normal car and it has a special transmission manufactured by Valeo installed which is convertible to both automatic and the standard 5-speed manual versions with the push of a button, a technology ahead of its time. The transmission was installed on special request of Agnelli as he suffered from a chronic leg injury.

The original car owned by Agnelli&#x27;s family friend was auctioned off in 2016 at a price of US$1.3 million. By that time, the car had been driven for 23,000 kilometers.

A red Testarossa convertible is the feature car in Sega&#x27;s arcade and home-console video-game franchise &quot;Out Run&quot;.
===Mythos===
The Ferrari Mythos is a mid-engined, rear wheel drive concept car based on the mechanical underpinnings of the Ferrari Testarossa. The Mythos is powered by a 4.9 L &quot;Tipo F113 B&quot; Ferrari flat-12 engine sourced from the Ferrari Testarossa, the engine produces at 6,300 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm while having a power to weight ratio of per tonne. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Testarossa sourced 5-speed manual transmission. The car utilises a helical coil suspension system with transverse arms on the front and rear. Acceleration figures of the car remain unknown, but the car has a projected top speed of about .

===Colani Ferrari Testa d&#x27;Oro===

Designed by Luigi Colani in 1989, the Testa d&#x27;Oro was designed to break land speed records at the salt flats. It was based on a Testarossa with a turbocharged flat-12 engine featuring a 5.0 L Ferrari-Lotec turbocharger. The engine had a power output of at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm. It successfully broke the record in its class in 1991, reaching with catalytic converters fitted.

===FX===
The Ferrari FX was a special order sports car custom made by Pininfarina at the request of the 29th Sultan of Brunei. It featured the flat-twelve engine of the Ferrari F512 M, on which it is based, and a 7-speed sequential manual transmission from the Williams Formula One team. Only seven or nine cars were made depending on the source, six of which were delivered to the royal family in Brunei. After the Sultan cancelled delivery of car number four, Dick Marconi bought the car from Williams. Car number four is now on display at the Marconi Automotive Museum in Tustin, California, US. The FX has a top speed of around , yet Ferrari claimed &quot;We don&#x27;t want to make the fastest car in the world&quot;.

===FZ93===

The FZ93 (Formula Zagato &#x27;93) was designed by Ercole Spada as a follow-up to Zagato&#x27;s series of Ferrari specials. In 1994 the car was reworked and repainted all-red; it was also renamed as &quot;ES1&quot; in honour of its designer.

===F90===
For almost 18 years, Ferrari denied that the F90 existed. The project was eventually discovered along with the fact that six were made for the Sultan of Brunei in 1988.

The project was managed by Enrico Fumia, the head of the Research and Development department at Pininfarina. At the time, the project was top secret to that extent that Ferrari themselves didn&#x27;t know of the project. Fumia styled the car and said the F90 name referred to it being a &quot;Ferrari of the &#x27;90s.&quot;

All six F90s used a Ferrari Testarossa chassis on top of which Pininfarina sculpted an entirely new body and interior. The engines were stock units, having a power output of and having a rear-wheel drive layout, but the radiators were moved to the front of the car.

<text>John Pope (March 16, 1822 – September 23, 1892) was a career United States Army officer and Union general in the American Civil War. He had a brief stint in the Western Theater, but he is best known for his defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas) in the East.

Pope was a graduate of the United States Military Academy in 1842. He served in the Mexican–American War and had numerous assignments as a topographical engineer and surveyor in Florida, New Mexico, and Minnesota. He spent much of the last decade before the Civil War surveying possible southern routes for the proposed first transcontinental railroad. He was an early appointee as a Union brigadier general of volunteers and served initially under Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont. He achieved initial success against Brig. Gen. Sterling Price in Missouri, then led a successful campaign that captured Island No. 10 on the Mississippi River. This inspired the Lincoln administration to bring him to the Eastern Theater to lead the newly formed Army of Virginia.

He initially distanced himself from many of his officers and men by publicly denigrating their record in comparison to his Western command. He launched an offensive against the Confederate army of General Robert E. Lee, in which he fell prey to a strategic turning movement into his rear areas by Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson. At Second Bull Run, he concentrated his attention on attacking Jackson while the other Confederate corps led by Maj. Gen. James Longstreet attacked his flank and routed his army. 

Following Manassas, Pope was banished far from the Eastern Theater to the Department of the Northwest in Minnesota, where he commanded U.S. Forces in the Dakota War of 1862. He was appointed to command the Department of the Missouri in 1865 and was a prominent and activist commander during Reconstruction in Atlanta. For the rest of his military career, he fought in the Indian Wars, particularly against the Apache and Sioux.

==Early life==
Pope was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Nathaniel Pope, a prominent Federal judge in early Illinois Territory and a friend of lawyer Abraham Lincoln. He was the brother-in-law of Manning Force, and a distant cousin married the sister of Mary Todd Lincoln. He graduated from the United States Military Academy, 17th in a class of 56, in 1842, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. 

He served in Florida and then helped survey the northeastern border between the United States and Canada. He fought under Zachary Taylor in the Battle of Monterrey and Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican–American War, for which he was appointed a brevet first lieutenant and captain, respectively. After the war Pope worked as a surveyor in Minnesota. In 1850 he demonstrated the navigability of the Red River. He served as the chief engineer of the Department of New Mexico from 1851 to 1853 and spent the remainder of the years preceding the Civil War surveying a route for the Pacific Railroad.

==Civil War==
Pope was serving on lighthouse duty when Abraham Lincoln was elected and he was one of four officers selected to escort the president-elect to Washington, D.C. He offered to serve Lincoln as an aide, but on June 14, 1861, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers (date of rank effective May 17, 1861) and was ordered to Illinois to recruit volunteers.

In the Department of the West under Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont, Pope assumed command of the District of North and Central Missouri in July, with operational control along a portion of the Mississippi River. He had an uncomfortable relationship with Frémont and politicked behind the scenes to get him removed from command. Frémont was convinced that Pope had treacherous intentions toward him, demonstrated by his lack of action in following Frémont&#x27;s offensive plans in Missouri. Historian Allan Nevins wrote, &quot;Actually, incompetence and timidity offer a better explanation of Pope than treachery, though he certainly showed an insubordinate spirit.&quot; 

Pope eventually forced the Confederates under Sterling Price to retreat southward, taking 1,200 prisoners in a minor action at Blackwater, Missouri, on December 18. Pope, who established a reputation as a braggart early in the war, was able to generate significant press interest in his minor victory, which brought him to the attention of Frémont&#x27;s replacement, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck.

Halleck appointed Pope to command the Army of the Mississippi (and the District of the Mississippi, Department of the Missouri) on February 23, 1862. Given 25,000 men, he was ordered to clear Confederate obstacles on the Mississippi River. He made a surprise march on New Madrid, Missouri, and captured it on March 14. He then orchestrated a campaign to capture Island No. 10, a strongly fortified post garrisoned by 12,000 men and 58 guns. Pope&#x27;s engineers cut a channel that allowed him to bypass the island. Assisted by the gunboats of Captain Andrew H. Foote, he landed his men on the opposite shore, which isolated the defenders. The island garrison surrendered on April 7, 1862, freeing Union navigation of the Mississippi as far south as Memphis.

Pope&#x27;s outstanding performance on the Mississippi earned him a promotion to major general, dated as of March 21, 1862. During the Siege of Corinth, he commanded the left wing of Halleck&#x27;s army, but he was soon summoned to the East by Lincoln. After the collapse of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign, Pope was appointed to command the Army of Virginia, assembled from scattered forces in the Shenandoah Valley and Northern Virginia. This promotion infuriated Frémont, who resigned his commission.

Pope brought an attitude of self-assurance that was offensive to the eastern soldiers under his command. He issued an astonishing message to his new army on July 14, 1862, that included the following:


Despite this bravado, and despite receiving units from McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac that swelled the Army of Virginia to 70,000 men, Pope&#x27;s aggressiveness exceeded his strategic capabilities, particularly since he was now facing Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Lee, sensing that Pope was indecisive, split his smaller (55,000-man) army, sending Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson with 24,000 men as a diversion to Cedar Mountain, where Jackson defeated Pope&#x27;s subordinate, Nathaniel Banks.

As Lee advanced on Pope with the remainder of his army, Jackson swung around to the north and captured Pope&#x27;s main supply base at Manassas Station. Confused and unable to locate the main Confederate force, Pope walked into a trap in the Second Battle of Bull Run. His men withstood a combined attack by Jackson and Lee on August 29, 1862, but on the following day, reluctantly obeying Pope&#x27;s orders, Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter swung to attack Jackson, exposing his (and by extension the whole Union army&#x27;s) flank. Maj. Gen. James Longstreet launched a surprise flanking attack, and the Union Army was soundly defeated and forced to retreat. Pope compounded his unpopularity with the Army by blaming his defeat on disobedience by Maj. Gen. Porter, who was found guilty by court-martial and disgraced.

Brigadier General Alpheus S. Williams, who served briefly under Pope, held the general in particularly low esteem. In a letter to his daughter, he wrote:


Pope himself was relieved of command on September 12, 1862, and his army was merged into the Army of the Potomac under McClellan. He spent the remainder of the war in the Department of the Northwest in Minnesota, dealing with the Dakota War of 1862. His months campaigning in the West paid career dividends because he was assigned to command the Military Division of the Missouri on January 30, 1865, and received a brevet promotion to major general in the regular army on March 13, 1865, for his service at Island No. 10.

==Postwar years==
In April 1867, Pope was named governor of the Reconstruction Third Military District and made his headquarters in Atlanta, issuing orders that allowed African Americans to serve on juries, ordering Mayor James Williams to remain in office another year, postponing elections, and banning city advertising in newspapers that did not favor Reconstruction. President Andrew Johnson removed him from command December 28, 1867, replacing him with George G. Meade. Following this, Pope was appointed head of the Department of the Lakes (based in Detroit, Michigan) from January 13, 1868, to April 30, 1870.

Pope returned to the West as commander of the Department of the Missouri (the nation&#x27;s second-largest geographical command) during the Grant presidency, and held that command through 1883. He served with distinction in the Apache Wars, including the Red River War relocating Southern Plains tribes to reservations in Oklahoma. General Pope made political enemies in Washington when he recommended that the reservation system would be better administered by the military than the corrupt Indian Bureau. He also engendered controversy by calling for better and more humane treatment of Native Americans, but author Walter Donald Kennedy notes that he also said &quot;It is my purpose to utterly exterminate the Sioux&quot; and planned to make a &quot;final settlement with all these Indians&quot;.

Pope&#x27;s reputation suffered a serious blow in 1879 when a late-convened Board of Inquiry called by President Rutherford B. Hayes and led by Maj. Gen. John Schofield (Pope&#x27;s immediate predecessor in the Department of the Missouri and then head of the Department of the Pacific) concluded that Major General Fitz John Porter had been unfairly convicted of cowardice and disobedience at the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Schofield report used evidence of former Confederate commanders and concluded that Pope himself bore most of the responsibility for the Union loss. The report characterized Pope as reckless and dangerously uninformed about events during the battle, also criticized General Irvin McDowell (whom Pope detested), and credited Porter&#x27;s perceived disobedience with saving the Union army from complete ruin.

Pope was promoted to major general in the Regular Army in 1882 and was assigned to command of the Military Division of the Pacific in 1883 where he served until his retirement.

==Death and legacy==
Pope retired as a major general in the Regular Army on March 16, 1886, and his wife, Clara Pope, died two years later. The &quot;National Tribune&quot; serialized his memoirs, publishing them between February 1887 and March 1891. General Pope died on September 23, 1892, at the Ohio Soldiers&#x27; Home near Sandusky, Ohio. He is buried beside his wife in Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis, Missouri.

<text>This article is a list of viscountcies in the peerages of Britain and Ireland, including the England, the Scotland, the Ireland, the Great Britain and the Peerage of the United Kingdom, listed in order of creation, including extant, extinct and abeyant titles. A viscount is the fourth rank in the peerage of the United Kingdom, Great Britain, England, Scotland and Ireland. A relatively late introduction, holders of the title take precedence after earls and before barons.

The term &quot;viscount&quot; (&quot;vice-comes&quot;) was originally a judicial honorific, long used in Anglo-Norman England to refer to a county sheriff. It was only turned into a noble title, with hereditary dignity, in England by Henry VI in 1440, following the similar transformation of that title in France.

The majority of viscountcies are held by peers with higher titles, such as duke, marquess or earl; this can come about for a number of reasons, including the title being created as a subsidiary title at the same time as the higher peerage, the holder being elevated at a later time to a higher peerage or through inheritance when one individual is the heir to two separate titles.

Viscounts were created in the peerages of England and Scotland until the Act of Union 1707, thereafter being created in the peerage of Great Britain. After the Acts of Union 1800 came into effect in 1801, all peerages were created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland were created by English and British monarchs in their capacity as Lord or King of Ireland. Irish peers were not initially granted a seat in the House of Lords and so allowed the grantee to sit in the House of Commons. Viscounts of Ireland have precedence below peers of England, Scotland, and Great Britain of the same rank, and above peers of the United Kingdom of the same rank; but Irish peers created after 1801 yield to United Kingdom peers of earlier creation.

A number of Speakers of the House of Commons have been elevated to the peerage as viscounts. Of the nineteen Speakers between 1801 and 1983, eleven were made viscounts, five were made barons, one refused a peerage and two died in office (and their widows were created a viscountess and a baroness). The last such was George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy upon his retirement in 1983. Since then it has become more common to grant life peerages to retiring Speakers.

==Naming conventions==
In British practice, the title of a viscount may be either a place name, a surname, or a combination thereof: examples include the Viscount Falmouth, the Viscount Hardinge and the Viscount Colville of Culross, respectively. An exception exists for Viscounts in the peerage of Scotland, who were traditionally styled &quot;The Viscount &quot;of&quot; [X]&quot;, such as the Viscount of Arbuthnott. In practice, however, very few maintain this style, instead using the more common version &quot;The Viscount [X]&quot; in general parlance.

==Courtesy viscountcies==
Many extant viscountcies are used as courtesy titles; a specifically British custom is the heir apparent of an earl or marquess being referred to as a viscount, if the second most senior title held by the head of the family is a viscount. For example, the eldest son of the Earl Howe is Viscount Curzon, because this is the second most senior title held by the Earl. However, the son of a marquess or an earl can be referred to as a viscount when the title of viscount is not the second most senior if those above it share their name with the substantive title. For example, the second most senior title of the Marquess of Salisbury is the Earl of Salisbury, so his heir uses the lower title of Viscount Cranborne, to avoid any possible confusion caused by them both being referred to as &quot;Lord Salisbury&quot;. Sometimes the son of a peer can be referred to as a viscount even when he could use a more senior courtesy title which differs in name from the substantive title. Family tradition plays a role in this. For example, the eldest son of the Marquess of Londonderry is Viscount Castlereagh, even though the Marquess is also the Earl Vane.

<doc id="563379" wikidata="Q769744" url="?curid=563379" title="Football League Second Division">
<text>The Football League Second Division was the second level division in the English football league system between 1892 and 1992. Following the foundation of the FA Premier League, the Football League divisions were renumbered and the third tier became known as the Football League Second Division, while the second level was branded &quot;First Division,&quot; below the Premiership. After the rebranding of the Football League in 2003–04, the second tier became known as the Championship, and the third tier became known as Football League One.

==Early history==
In 1888, Scotsman William McGregor a director of Aston Villa, was the main force between meetings held in London and Manchester involving 12 football clubs, with an eye to a league competition. These 12 clubs would later become the Football League&#x27;s 12 founder members. The meetings were held in London on 22 March 1888. The main concern was that an early exit in the knockout format of the FA Cup could leave clubs with no matches for almost a year; not only could they suffer heavy financial losses, but fans did not wait long without a game, when other teams were playing. Matters were finalised on 17 April in Manchester.

McGregor had voted against the name The Football League, as he was concerned that it would be associated with the Irish Land League. But this name still won by a majority vote and was selected. The competition guaranteed fixtures for all of its member clubs. Geographically, these were split equally between the North and the Midlands.

A rival English league called the Football Alliance operated from 1889 to 1892. In 1892 it was decided to formally merge the two leagues, and so the &quot;Football League Second Division&quot; was formed, consisting mostly of Football Alliance clubs. The existing League clubs, plus three of the strongest Alliance clubs, comprised the Football League First Division.

==Overview==
The Second Division was formed in 1892 with 12 clubs, most of which had previously played in the Football Alliance. The original members were: Ardwick (now Manchester City), Bootle, Burton Swifts, Crewe Alexandra, Darwen, Grimsby Town, Lincoln City, Northwich Victoria, Port Vale, Sheffield United, Small Heath (now Birmingham City), and Walsall. Leicester City and Manchester City both hold the record for most second tier championships (8).

It expanded over the years to its final total of 24 clubs, as follows:

* 1893 – 15 clubs
* 1894 – 16
* 1898 – 18
* 1905 – 20
* 1919 – 22
* 1987 – 23
* 1988 – 24

For the first few years, there was no automatic promotion to the First Division. Instead, the top few teams in Division Two, including the winners, contested a series of test matches against the bottom teams in Division One. Small Heath, Second Division champions in 1892–93, were denied promotion after losing in test matches to Newton Heath. However, runners-up Sheffield United beat Accrington to become the first team to win promotion to the First Division. Test matches were abolished in 1898 after Burnley and Stoke conspired to deliberately draw their test match 0–0, which resulted in Burnley being promoted and Stoke being saved from relegation.

Relegation to the Football League Third Division was in place in the season before the latter even started, as Grimsby Town (last place in 1919–20) made way for Cardiff City and formed the new Third Division with southern clubs. For subsequent seasons, two clubs were relegated into either the Third Division North or Third Division South depending on their geographical location. When the Third Division was reunified in 1958–59, the relegation arrangement was kept; a third club began being relegated in 1974.

In 1958 he earned a B.A. degree with first class honors in Slavic Studies from the University of Nottingham, and edited the student newspaper, &quot;The Gongster&quot;. Having spent a year teaching English at the University of Ljubljana in the former Yugoslavia, he attended graduate school at Columbia University and later obtained his doctorate in Slavic Studies.

==Career==

===Translations===
While in graduate school, Scammell taught Russian Literature at Hunter College and began translating books from Russian. His first translation was a novel, &quot;Cities and Years&quot;, by the Soviet author, Konstantin Fedin. Having been introduced to Vladimir Nabokov, he translated two of Nabokov&#x27;s Russian novels into English, &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;The Defense,&quot; followed by a translation of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

After moving back to England in 1965, Scammell translated &quot;Childhood, Boyhood and Youth&quot; by Lev Tolstoy and a detective novel, &quot;Petrovka 38&quot;, by the Soviet author, Yulian Semyonov. Two years later he joined the External Services division of the BBC as a Language Supervisor for East European Languages, and after becoming interested in the plight of Russian dissidents, translated a memoir about the post-Stalin gulag, &quot;My Testimony&quot;, by a former prisoner, Anatoly Marchenko. Together with the Slovenian poet, Veno Taufer, whom he met at the BBC, he also translated a selection of modern Slovenian poetry for a special issue of &quot;Modern Poetry in Translation&quot;. Many years later, he and Taufer translated a selection of poems by Slovenia&#x27;s premier modern poet, Edvard Kocbek, under the title, &quot;Nothing Is Lost&quot;.

===Index on Censorship===

In 1971, Scammell became the first director of the nonprofit Writers and Scholars International (later the Writers and Scholars Educational Trust) in London, and started the quarterly magazine, &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;, devoted to documenting censorship worldwide and promoting freedom of expression. In 1976 he was asked to revive the International PEN Club&#x27;s moribund Writers in Prison Committee and remained chair for the next ten years.

For the next few years, he edited and partly translated an anthology of censored writing, &quot;Russia&#x27;s Other Writers&quot;; edited an illustrated catalog, &quot;Unofficial Art from the Soviet Union&quot; to accompany an exhibition of paintings and sculpture he helped to organize under the same name; translated &quot;To Build a Castle&quot; by Vladimir Bukovsky; edited and supervised the translation of a set of cultural and political essays selected by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, &quot;From Under the Rubble&quot;; vetted the American translation of the first two volumes of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; by Solzhenitsyn; and arranged for the translation and publication of Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s pamphlet, &quot;Letter to the Soviet Leaders&quot;, written shortly before the latter&#x27;s expulsion from the Soviet Union.

===Biographies===

After meeting Solzhenitsyn in Zurich and Frankfurt, Scammell undertook to write Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s biography (with the author&#x27;s consent and cooperation, but without his authorization) and resigned from &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; to work on it full-time. Between 1981 and 1983 he lived in New York, chaired a seminar on censorship at New York University, ran an exchange program with Eastern Europe funded by George Soros, and attended weekly meetings of the New York Institute for the Humanities. Returning to England, he completed and published &quot;Solzhenitsyn, A Biography&quot; (1984).

Scammell was commissioned to write the authorized biography of Arthur Koestler, which after fifteen years of research and writing was published in the United States in 2009 as &quot;Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth Century Skeptic,&quot; and in the UK in 2010 as &quot;Koestler: The Indispensable Intellectual.&quot; The book won the PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for the best biography of 2009 in the United States and the Spears Magazine Award for best biography of 2010 in the UK. It was also shortlisted for the 2010 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for biography. The New York Times Book Review listed it as one of the &quot;100 Best Books of 2010&quot;.

In 2016, Scammell reported the discovery by German doctoral candidate Matthias Weßel of the original German version of Koestler&#x27;s &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;. A Swiss university had archived it under the title &quot;Koestler, Arthur. Rubaschow: Roman. Typoskript, März 1940, 326 pages.&quot; He deemed the discovery important because &quot;&quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; is that rare specimen, a book known to the world only in translation.&quot; In 2018, he reported that Elsinor Verlag (publisher of the 1946 German translation) had published the German original, as &quot;Sonnenfinsternis&quot; (&quot;Solar Eclipse&quot;) in May 2018, with an introduction by Scammell and an afterword by Weßel. He also reported a new English translation to appear in 2019, with a different introduction and appendices. In August 2019, Scammell mentioned the new German original in &quot;The New York Times&quot; but made no reference to the forthcoming English translation or its publication date. An English translation based on the newfound text was published in September 2019. Scammell was its editor; Philip Boehm was its translator.

===Academics===
In 1985, Scammell returned to the United States to settle there permanently. From 1986 to 1994 he was a professor of Russian literature at Cornell University, and in 1994 moved to Columbia University to become Professor of Writing (Nonfiction) and Translation. He retired from Columbia at the end of 2011.

He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a vice president of International PEN. He has received fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Program, the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Ford Foundation, the Leverhulme Trust, the Jerusalem Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Historical Research Foundation.

==Personal life==
Scammell is married to Rosemary Nossiff, a professor of Political Science at Marymount Manhattan College and previously a professor at Rutgers University.

He was previously married to Erika Roettges, with whom he has four children, Catherine, Stephen, Lesley and Ingrid.

==Works==
Scammell has written for the &quot;Times Literary Supplement,&quot; &quot;The Observer,&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; in the UK and has contributed articles and criticism to the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;AGNI&quot;, and several other journals in the US.

<text>Skylab 3 (also SL-3 and SLM-2) was the second crewed mission to the first American space station, Skylab. The mission began on July 28, 1973, with the launch of NASA astronauts Alan Bean, Owen Garriott, and Jack Lousma in the Apollo command and service module on the Saturn IB rocket, and lasted 59 days, 11 hours and 9 minutes. A total of 1,084.7 astronaut-utilization hours were tallied by the Skylab 3 crew performing scientific experiments in the areas of medical activities, solar observations, Earth resources, and other experiments.

The crewed Skylab missions were officially designated Skylab 2, 3, and 4. Miscommunication about the numbering resulted in the mission emblems reading &quot;Skylab I&quot;, &quot;Skylab II&quot;, and &quot;Skylab 3&quot; respectively.

==Mission highlights==

While approaching Skylab a propellant leak developed in one of the Apollo Service Module&#x27;s reaction control system thruster quads. The crew was able to safely dock with the station, but troubleshooting continued with the problem. Six days later, another thruster quad developed a leak, creating concern amongst Mission Control. For the first time, an Apollo spacecraft was rolled out to Launch Complex 39 for Skylab Rescue, made possible by the ability for the station to have two Apollo CSMs docked at the same time. It was eventually determined that the CSM could be safely maneuvered using only two working thruster quads, and the rescue mission was never launched.

After recovering from space sickness the crew, during their first EVA, installed the twin-pole sunshade, one of the two solutions for the destruction of the micrometeoroid shield during Skylab&#x27;s launch to keep the space station cool. It was installed over the parasol, which was originally deployed through a porthole airlock during Skylab 2. Both were brought to the station by Skylab 2.

Skylab 3 continued a comprehensive medical research program that extended the data on human physiological adaptation and readaptation to space flight collected on the previous Skylab 2 mission. In addition, Skylab 3 extended the astronauts&#x27; stay in space from approximately one month to two months. Therefore, the effects of flight duration on physiological adaptation and readaptation could be examined.

A set of core medical investigations were performed on all three Skylab crewed missions. These core investigations were the same basic investigations that were performed on Skylab 2, except that the Skylab 3 inflight tests were supplemented with extra tests based on what researchers learned from the Skylab 2 science results. For example, only leg volume measurements, preflight and postflight stereophotogrammetry, and in-flight maximum calf girth measurements were originally scheduled for all three Skylab missions.

In-flight photographs from Skylab 2 revealed the &quot;puffy face syndrome&quot; which prompted the addition of in-flight torso and limb girth measurements to gather more data on the apparent headward fluid shift on Skylab 3. Other additional tests included arterial blood flow measurements by an occlusive cuff placed around the leg, facial photographs taken before flight and during flight to study the &quot;puffy face syndrome&quot;, venous compliance, hemoglobin, urine specific gravity, and urine mass measurements. These inflight tests gave additional information about fluid distribution and fluid balance to get a better understanding of the fluid shift phenomena.

The Skylab 3 biological experiments studied the effects of microgravity on mice, fruit flies, single cells and cell culture media. Human lung cells were flown to examine the biochemical characteristics of cell cultures in the microgravity environment. The two animal experiments involved the chronobiology of little pocket mice and circadian rhythm in vinegar gnats. Both experiments were unsuccessful due to a power failure 30 hours after launch, which killed the animals.

High school students from across the United States participated in the Skylab missions as the primary investigators of experiments that studied astronomy, physics, and fundamental biology. The student experiments performed on Skylab 3 included the study of libration clouds, X-rays from Jupiter, in-vitro immunology, spider web formation, cytoplasmic streaming, mass measurement, and neutron analysis.

The crew&#x27;s health was assessed on Skylab by collecting data on dental health, environmental and crew microbiology, radiation, and toxicological aspects of the Skylab orbital workshop. Other assessments were made of astronaut maneuvering equipment and of the habitability of the crew quarters, and crew activities/maintenance experiments were examined on Skylab 2 through 4 to better understand the living and working aspects of life in space.

==S150 Galactic X-Ray Mapping==

The S150 X-ray experiment was sent up with Skylab 3. The 1,360 kg X-ray astronomy satellite experiment was designed to look for soft galactic x-rays. Short missions had been done before, and S150 would be a longer project. S150 had a large soft x-ray detector, and was mounted atop the Saturn S-IVB upper stage. When released, S150 flew behind and below Skylab on 28 July 1973. The S150 experiment deployed after the Apollo capsule separated from the S-IVB stage. S150 had its own protective housing for the flight. The experiment on S150 ran for 5 hours, as its batteries allowed S150 to measure half of the sky. Experiment data was recorded on tape recorder and sent to ground stations when available. S150 was designed by University of Wisconsin scientists Dr. William L. Kraushaar and Alan Bunner. S150 could detect 40–100 angstrom photons.

==Spider web experiment==
Spider webs were spun by two female European garden spiders (cross spiders) called Arabella and Anita, as part of an experiment on Skylab 3. The aim of the experiment was to test whether the two spiders would spin webs in space, and, if so, whether these webs would be the same as those that spiders produced on Earth. The experiment was a student project of Judy Miles of Lexington, Massachusetts.

After the launch the spiders were released by astronaut Owen Garriott into a box that resembled a window frame. The spiders proceeded to construct their web while a camera took photographs and examined the spiders&#x27; behavior in a zero-gravity environment. Both spiders took a long time to adapt to their weightless existence. However, after a day, Arabella spun the first web in the experimental cage, although it was initially incomplete.
The web was completed the following day. The crew members were prompted to expand the initial protocol. They fed and watered the spiders, giving them a house fly. The first web was removed on August 13 to allow Arabella to construct a second web. At first, she failed to construct a new web. When given more water, she built a second web. This time, it was more elaborate than the first. Both spiders died during the mission, possibly from dehydration.

When scientists studied the webs they discovered that the space webs were finer than normal Earth webs, and although the patterns of the web were not totally dissimilar, variations were spotted, and there was a definite difference in the characteristics of the web. The webs were finer overall, and the space web had variations in thickness. This was unusual, because Earth webs have been observed to have uniform thickness.

Later experiments indicated that having a light source could orient the spiders and enable them to build their normal asymmetric webs when gravity was not a factor.

==Splashdown==
The Skylab 3 mission returned to Earth with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at 22:20 UTC on September 25, 1973. The crew and command module were recovered by the USS &quot;New Orleans&quot;, about 360 km (225 mi) off the Californian coast, southwest of San Diego. At the time, the crew held several space endurance records including: most time in space at 59 days, 11 hours, and 9 minutes; as well as holding the most orbits of the Earth, by a crew, at 858. This was the last Skylab splashdown to be covered live by American broadcast television news media, as Skylab 4&#x27;s splashdown was not covered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skylab 4 Splashdo/wn&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission insignia==
The circular crew patch was Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s c. 1490 &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, representing the mission&#x27;s medical experiments and retouched to remove the genitalia. In the background is a disk that is half Sun (including sunspots) and half Earth to represent the experiments done on the flight. The patch has a white background, the crew&#x27;s names and &quot;Skylab II&quot; with a red, white and blue border.
The wives of the crew secretly had an alternate graphic made of a &#x27;universal woman&#x27; with their first names in place of the crew&#x27;s. Stickers with this on them were put in lockers aboard the Command Module to surprise the crew.

==Gallery==
==Spacecraft location==
In 1977 the command module was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution by NASA. The command module was moved to the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland, Ohio, in June 2010. It took a year to plan and US$120,000 to move the capsule. It is currently on display at the visitor&#x27;s center of the NASA Glenn Research Center at the science center.

Unlike earlier Apollo modules, Skylab ones had white paint on the sunward side to help with spacecraft thermal management.

<text>The Select Society of Sanitary Sludge Shovelers (5S) is used by water environment associations (i.e., those working with sewage and sewage treatment) to honour those who have made a particular contribution to the industry.

Pennsylvania started the High Hat Society in 1937 and used the words &quot;Sludge Shovelers Society&quot; in its initiation ceremony. Later, this became known as the Ted Moses Sludge Shovelers Society. The second Chapter of the Five S Society was formed in Arizona in October 1940, the idea being conceived by A.W. &quot;Dusty&quot; Miller and F. Carlyle Roberts Jr. There are chapters in the United States and in Canada, as well as the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

5S chapters do not accept applications, but select potential members. Each inductee receives a badge in the form of a gold tie bar in the shape of a round-nosed shovel.

<text>A receptor potential, also known as a generator potential, a type of graded potential, is the transmembrane potential difference produced by activation of a sensory receptor.

A receptor potential is often produced by sensory transduction. It is generally a depolarizing event resulting from inward current flow. The influx of current will often bring the membrane potential of the sensory receptor towards the threshold for triggering an action potential. Receptor potential can work to trigger an action potential either within the same neuron or on an adjacent cell. Within the same neuron, a receptor potential can cause local current to flow to a region capable of generating an action potential by opening voltage-gated ion channels. A receptor potential can also cause the release of neurotransmitters from one cell that will act on another cell, generating an action potential in the second cell. The magnitude of the receptor potential determines the frequency with which action potentials are generated and is controlled by adaptation, stimulus strength, and temporal summation of successive receptor potentials. Receptor potential relies on receptor sensitivity which can adapt slowly, resulting in a slowly decaying receptor potential or rapidly, resulting in a quickly generated but shorter-lasting receptor potential.

An example of a receptor potential is in a taste bud, where taste is converted into an electrical signal sent to the brain. When stimulated, the taste bud triggers the release of neurotransmitters through exocytosis of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic membrane of the primary sensory neuron, where they elicit an action potential.

<text>In neuroanatomy, a neural pathway is the connection formed by axons that project from neurons to make synapses onto neurons in another location, to enable neurotransmission (the sending of a signal from one region of the nervous system to another). Neurons are connected by a single axon, or by a bundle of axons known as a nerve tract, or fasciculus. Shorter neural pathways are found within grey matter in the brain, whereas longer projections, made up of myelinated axons, constitute white matter.

In the hippocampus, there are neural pathways involved in its circuitry including the perforant pathway, that provides a connectional route from the entorhinal cortex to all fields of the hippocampal formation, including the dentate gyrus, all CA fields (including CA1), and the subiculum.

Descending motor pathways of the pyramidal tracts travel from the cerebral cortex to the brainstem or lower spinal cord. Ascending sensory tracts in the dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway (DCML) carry information from the periphery to the cortex of the brain.

==Naming==
The first named pathways are evident to the naked eye even in a poorly preserved brain, and were named by the great anatomists of the Renaissance using cadaver material. Examples of these include the great &quot;commissures&quot; of the brain such as the corpus callosum (Latin, &quot;hard body&quot;; not to be confused with the Latin word &quot;colossus&quot; the &quot;huge&quot; statue), &quot;anterior commissure&quot;, and &quot;posterior commissure&quot;. Further examples include the pyramidal tract, crus cerebri (Latin, &quot;leg of the brain&quot;), and &quot;cerebellar peduncles&quot; (Latin, &quot;little foot of the cerebellum&quot;). Note that these names describe the &quot;appearance&quot; of a structure but give no information on its function, location, etc.

Later, as neuroanatomical knowledge became more sophisticated, the trend was toward naming pathways by their origin and termination. For example, the nigrostriatal pathway runs from the substantia nigra (Latin, &quot;black substance&quot;) to the corpus striatum (Latin, &quot;striped body&quot;). This naming can extend to include any number of structures in a pathway, such that the cerebellorubrothalamocortical pathway originates in the cerebellum, synapses in the red nucleus (&quot;ruber&quot; in Latin), on to the thalamus, and finally terminating in the cerebral cortex.

Sometimes, these two naming conventions coexist. For example, the name &quot;pyramidal tract&quot; has been mainly supplanted by lateral corticospinal tract in most texts. Note that the &quot;old&quot; name was primarily descriptive, evoking the pyramids of antiquity, from the appearance of this neural pathway in the medulla oblongata. The &quot;new&quot; name is based primarily on its origin (in the primary motor cortex, Brodmann area 4) and termination (onto the alpha motor neurons of the spinal cord).

In the cerebellum, one of the two major pathways is that of the mossy fibers. Mossy fibers project directly to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. The other main pathway is from the climbing fibers and these project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals directly to the deep nuclei.

==Functional aspects==
In general, neurons receive information either at their dendrites or cell bodies. The axon of a nerve cell is, in general, responsible for transmitting information over a relatively long distance. Therefore, most neural pathways are made up of axons. If the axons have myelin sheaths, then the pathway appears bright white because myelin is primarily lipid. If most or all of the axons lack myelin sheaths (i.e., are &quot;unmyelinated&quot;), then the pathway will appear a darker beige color, which is generally called &quot;grey&quot;.

Some neurons are responsible for conveying information over long distances. For example, motor neurons, which travel from the spinal cord to the muscle, can have axons up to a meter in length in humans. The longest axon in the human body belongs to the Sciatic Nerve and runs from the great toe to the base of the spinal cord. These are archetypal examples of neural pathways.

==Basal ganglia pathways and dopamine==
Neural pathways in the basal ganglia in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, are seen as controlling different aspects of behaviour. This regulation is enabled by the dopamine pathways. It has been proposed that the dopamine system of pathways is the overall organiser of the neural pathways that are seen to be parallels of the dopamine pathways. Dopamine is provided both tonically and phasically in response to the needs of the neural pathways.

<text>Bert Keizer (born 1947 in Amersfoort) is a Dutch writer and geriatrician.

He lived in England from 1968-1972 and studied philosophy at the University of Nottingham, then medicine at the University of Amsterdam. He qualified as a doctor in 1981 and then worked shortly in Kenya. Since 1985 he has been a geriatrician in Amsterdam.

== Writing == 
As a physician in a nursing home he has written about physician assisted suicide (which has been legal in the Netherlands for some years), most notably in his book &quot;Het refrein is Hein&quot;, which was translated into English (by Keizer himself) as &quot;Dancing with Mr D&quot; and published by Transworld-Doubleday in 1994. The book was also translated into German, Spanish, Japanese, Danish, Swedish, Russian, Korean and French.

His style is contemplative, with an undercurrent of realism (or some would say pessimism) about the limits of medicine which most people prefer not to think about, and a remarkable intellectual honesty about the emotions of the patient as well as the physician. 

While the topic of euthanasia and assisted suicide was the most salient point for the literary criticism, it is not a very large part of the book.

<doc id="563400" wikidata="Q957751" url="?curid=563400" title="XY gonadal dysgenesis">
<text>XY complete gonadal dysgenesis, also known as Swyer syndrome, is a type of defect hypogonadism in a person whose karyotype is 46,XY. Though they typically have normal vulvas, the person has underdeveloped gonads, fibrous tissue termed &quot;streak gonads&quot;, and if left untreated, will not experience puberty. The cause is a lack or inactivation of an SRY gene which is responsible for sexual differentiation. Pregnancy is sometimes possible in Swyer syndrome with assisted reproductive technology. The phenotype is usually similar to Turner syndrome (45,X0) due to a lack of X inactivation. The typical medical treatment is hormone replacement therapy.
The syndrome was named after Gerald Swyer, an endocrinologist based in London.

==Signs and symptoms==
Those with Swyer syndrome develop phenotypes typical of females and nonfunctional gonads. Individuals are most commonly diagnosed during adolescence after puberty fails to occur.

The consequences of Swyer syndrome without treatment:
* The individual&#x27;s gonads do not have two X chromosomes, so the breasts will not develop and the uterus will not grow and menstruate until estrogen is administered. This is often given transdermally.
* Their gonads cannot make progesterone, so menstrual periods will not be predictable until progestin is administered, usually as a pill.
* Their gonads cannot produce eggs, so conceiving children is not possible.
* Streak gonads with Y chromosome-containing cells have a high likelihood of developing cancer, especially gonadoblastoma. Streak gonads are usually removed within a year or so of diagnosis, since the cancer can begin during infancy.
* Osteopenia is often present.

==Genetics==

Genetic associations of Swyer syndrome include:

Seven other genes have been identified with probable associations that are as yet less clearly understood.

===Pure gonadal dysgenesis===
There are several forms of gonadal dysgenesis. The term &quot;pure gonadal dysgenesis&quot; (PGD) has been used to describe conditions with normal sets of sex chromosomes (e.g., 46,XX or 46,XY), as opposed to those whose gonadal dysgenesis results from missing all or part of the second sex chromosome. The latter group includes those with Turner syndrome (i.e., 45,X) and its variants, as well as those with mixed gonadal dysgenesis and a mixture of cell lines, some containing a Y chromosome (e.g., 46,XY/45,X).

Thus Swyer syndrome is referred to as PGD, 46,XY, and XX gonadal dysgenesis as PGD, 46,XX. People with PGD have a normal karyotype but may have defects of a specific gene on a chromosome.

==Pathogenesis==
The first known step of sexual differentiation of a male fetus is the development of testes. The early stages of testicular formation in the second month of gestation requires the action of several genes, one of the earliest and most important of which is &quot;SRY&quot;: the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome.

When such a gene is defective, the indifferent gonads fail to differentiate into testes in an XY fetus. Without testes, no testosterone or anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced. Without testosterone, the Wolffian ducts fail to develop, so no internal male organs are formed. Also, the lack of testosterone means that no dihydrotestosterone is formed and consequently the external genitalia fail to virilize, resulting in a normal vulva. Without AMH, the Müllerian ducts develop into normal internal female organs (uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix, vagina).

==Diagnosis==
Due to the inability of the streak gonads to produce sex hormones (both estrogens and androgens), most of the secondary sex characteristics do not develop. This is especially true of estrogenic changes such as breast development, widening of the pelvis and hips, and menstrual periods. As the adrenal glands can make limited amounts of androgens and are not affected by this syndrome, most of these persons will develop pubic hair, though it often remains sparse.

Evaluation of delayed puberty usually reveals elevation of gonadotropins, indicating that the pituitary is providing the signal for puberty but the gonads are failing to respond. The next steps of the evaluation usually include checking a karyotype and imaging of the pelvis. The karyotype reveals XY chromosomes and the imaging demonstrates the presence of a uterus but no ovaries (the streak gonads are not usually seen by most imaging). Although an XY karyotype can also indicate a person with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, the absence of breasts, and the presence of a uterus and pubic hair exclude the possibility. At this point it is usually possible for a physician to make a diagnosis of Swyer syndrome.

===Related conditions===
Swyer syndrome represents one phenotypic result of a failure of the gonads to develop properly, and hence is part of a class of conditions termed gonadal dysgenesis. There are many forms of gonadal dysgenesis.

Swyer syndrome is an example of a condition in which an externally unambiguous female body carries dysgenetic, atypical, or abnormal gonads. Other examples include complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, partial X chromosome deletions, lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Turner syndrome.

==Treatment==
Upon diagnosis, estrogen and progestogen therapy is typically commenced, promoting the development of female characteristics.

Hormone replacement therapy can also reduce the likelihood of osteoporosis.

==Epidemiology==
A 2017 study estimated that the incidence of Swyer syndrome is approximately 1 in 100,000 females. Fewer than 100 cases have been reported as of 2018. There are extremely rare instances of familial Swyer syndrome.

==History==
Swyer syndrome was first described by G. I. M. Swyer in 1955 in a report of two cases.

<doc id="563403" wikidata="Q382417" url="?curid=563403" title="Afferent nerve fiber">
<text>Afferent nerve fibers are axons (nerve fibers) of sensory neurons that carry sensory information from sensory receptors to the central nervous system. Many afferent projections &quot;arrive&quot; at a particular brain region.

In the peripheral nervous system, afferent nerve fibers are part of the sensory nervous system and arise from outside of the central nervous system. Sensory and mixed nerves contain afferent fibers.

==Structure==

Afferent neurons are pseudounipolar neurons that have a single process leaving the cell body dividing into two branches: the long one towards the sensory organ, and the short one toward the central nervous system (e.g. spinal cord).
These cells do have sensory afferent dendrites, similar to those typically inherent in neurons.
They have a smooth and rounded cell body located in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system.
Just outside the spinal cord, thousands of afferent neuronal cell bodies are aggregated in a swelling in the dorsal root known as the dorsal root ganglion.

All of the axons in the dorsal root, which contains afferent nerve fibers, are used in the transduction of somatosensory information. Somatosensory receptors include senses such as pain, touch, temperature, itch, and stretch. For example, a specific muscle fiber called an intrafusal muscle fiber is a type of afferent neuron that lies parallel to the extrafusal muscle fibers thus functions as a stretch receptor by detecting muscle length. 

All of these sensations travel along the same general pathways towards the brain. One pathwaydorsal column–medial lemniscus pathwaybegins with sensation from the periphery being sent via afferent nerve fiber of the dorsal root ganglion (first order neuron) through the spinal cord to the dorsal column nuclei (second order neuron) in the brainstem. The second order neuron&#x27;s projection decussates at the medulla through medial lemniscus to the third order neurons in the thalamus. The third order neuron&#x27;s axon terminates at the primary somatosensory cortex of the parietal lobe.

===Types===
Types of afferent fibers include the general somatic, the general visceral, the special somatic and the special visceral afferent fibers.

Alternatively, in the sensory system, afferent fibers can be classified by sizes with category specifications depending on if they innervate the skins or muscles.
==Function==

In the nervous system, there is a &quot;closed loop&quot; system of sensation, decision, and reactions. This process is carried out through the activity of sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. A touch or painful stimulus, for example, creates a sensation in the brain only after information about the stimulus travels there via afferent nerve pathways.

==Etymology and mnemonics==
Afferent is derived from Latin participle &#x27; (&quot;- = -&quot; : to + &#x27; : bear, carry), meaning &quot;carrying into&quot;, whereas efferent is derived from &quot;ex ferens&quot;, meaning &quot;carrying away&quot; (e- = &quot;ex-&quot; means &#x27;from&#x27;).
&quot;Ad&quot; and &quot;ex&quot; give an mnemonic device for remembering the relationship between &quot;afferent&quot; and &quot;efferent&quot; : afferent connection arrives&quot; and an efferent connection exits&quot;.

Another mnemonic device used for remembering afferent and efferent (in terms of the spinal cord, with its dorsal/ventral organization) is SAME DAVE. Sensory Afferent Motor Efferent, Dorsal Afferent Ventral Efferent.

Afferent and efferent are connected to affect and effect through their common Latin roots: afferent nerves affect the subject, whereas efferent nerves allow the subject to effect change.

<text>The Mitsubishi T-2 was a supersonic jet trainer aircraft used by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. Introduced in 1975, it was the first Japanese-designed aircraft to break the sound barrier. It was the basis of the Mitsubishi F-1 strike fighter. All T-2s were retired by 2006.

==Development==
Post-World War II rendered Japan without a modern jet fighter for defensive purposes. Two decades after World War II had concluded, Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) began to consider the development of a supersonic jet tentatively named &quot;T-X.&quot;

Japan had found that the subsonic Fuji T-1 jet trainer did not adequately prepare trainee pilots for more complex and difficult handling front line Mach 2 fighters such as the Lockheed F-104J Starfighter and McDonnell Douglas F-4EJ Phantom and so, in 1964–65, began studies for a new trainer, the T-X, which it was hoped would also form the basis for a future single-seat attack aircraft, the SF-X.

Consideration was also given to acquiring existing foreign aircraft instead of developing a new aircraft, with the United States offering the Northrop T-38 Talon, and the Anglo/French consortium SEPECAT offering the SEPECAT Jaguar as a trainer and single-seat fighter. Japan considered both aircraft carefully, and attempted to negotiate licensed production of the Jaguar, but these plans failed, possibly due to nationalism and the high royalty payments demanded by SEPECAT. In the end, Japan decided to manufacture its own design, which, produced to meet similar requirements, would closely resemble the Jaguar.

In 1967, Japanese aviation firms Fuji, Kawasaki, and Mitsubishi, each submitted proposals, and in September 1967, under lead designer Dr. Kenji Ikeda, Mitsubishi&#x27;s design was selected. The official contract was issued for the development of the XT-2 was placed on 30 March 1968, with Mitsubishi as prime contractor and Fuji as Prime sub-contractor. Several other subcontracts with aerospace firms and other minor aviation manufacturers were also established.

By March 1969, the design had been finalized, and the XT-2 prototype was rolled out on 28 April 1971, and performed its maiden flight on 20 July 1971. The XT-2 was followed by three more prototypes, and became the first aircraft of Japanese design to break the sound barrier in level flight. Two of the four prototypes were armed, and the other two were not.

A total of 90 production T-2s were built, including 28 unarmed &quot;T-2(Z)s&quot;, or &quot;&quot;Zenkigata&quot; (early type)&quot; and 62 armed &quot;T-2(K)s&quot;, or &quot;&quot;Kokigata&quot; (late type)&quot;; some sources translate these variants as &quot;T-2A&quot; and &quot;T-2B&quot; respectively. An additional two T-2(Z)s were built but modified for the S-FX / F-1 strike fighter program. The last T-2 rolled off the assembly line in 1988.

==Design==
The T-2&#x27;s configuration was clearly reminiscent of that of the two-seat Jaguar, with the two aircraft having the same overall configuration and some resemblance in details. In particular, the T-2 was also powered by two Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour turbofans, the same engine type used by the Jaguar, license-built by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries under the designation &quot;TF40-IHI-801A&quot;.

Despite this similarity, the T-2 was not a copy of the Jaguar, and the two aircraft could be distinguished at a glance, the T-2 having a more dartlike appearance, being noticeably longer and having a distinctly shorter wingspan than the Jaguar. The T-2 also had many detail differences. For example, since the JASDF had no rough-field requirement, the T-2 had conventional single-wheeled landing gear and not the distinctive heavy duty landing gear of the Jaguar.

The T-2 was made mostly of aircraft aluminum alloys, though it featured selective use of titanium. The high-mounted wings had a leading edge sweep of 42.5° and a 9° anhedral. The wings feature noticeable &quot;leading edge root extensions (LERX)&quot; and full-span leading edge slats, with a &quot;dogtooth&quot; discontinuity on the outer edge of the span, though the dogtooth did not split the slat. There was a single ¾-span flap on the trailing edge, unlike the full-span double-slotted split flaps of the Jaguar, but the T-2 did have twin spoilers on each wing just forward of the flap for roll control instead of ailerons, another element clearly derived from the Jaguar. There was a small fence mounted inboard on the top of the wing. There were no fuel tanks in the wings.

The tail assembly was conventional, featuring slab all-moving tailplanes with an anhedral of 15°. The steep anhedral kept the tailplanes out of the engine exhaust while allowing them to remain effective through the wing wash. Like the Jaguar, there was a fixed ventral fin under each exhaust, while two hydraulically operated airbrakes are fitted just forward of each ventral fin.

Each Adour engine provided 22.75 kN (5,115 lbf) max dry thrust and 32.49 kN (7,305 lbf) afterburning thrust. The TF40-801As did not have the &quot;part throttle reheat&quot; feature added to Adour 102s as an engine-out safety feature, and the T-2 was never refitted with more powerful Adour engine variants, along the lines of the Adour 104 eventually refitted to British Jaguars, leaving the T-2 somewhat underpowered. The engine intakes had fixed rectangular geometry and fuselage splitter plates, plus a set of spring-loaded auxiliary inlets behind the intake lip for increased airflow in ground running. There were large service doors beneath the fuselage that provided excellent access to the engines for maintenance.

The T-2&#x27;s tricycle landing gear all featured single wheels, with the nose gear retracting backward and the main gear retracting forward into the fuselage, rotating 90° to lie flat, and incorporated an antiskid control system. The nose gear was offset slightly to the right, with a small fixed vertical airfoil mounted in front of it to compensate for the extended nose gear&#x27;s tendency to cause yaw. A runway arresting hook was fitted under the tail behind the engine exhausts.

===Crew and safety===
The crew sat in tandem, with the flight instructor sitting behind the student on a raised seat to give a good forward view. There was a windblast screen between the two cockpits. The aircrew sat under separate clamshell canopies on Weber ES-7J zero-zero (zero altitude, zero speed) ejection seats, built by Daiseru. The seats featured specially modified canopy penetrators to ensure safe ejection even if the canopy wasn&#x27;t blown off. The seats also dispensed a cloud of radar-reflecting &quot;chaff&quot; on ejection to allow ground controllers to spot where the ejection occurred and direct search and rescue teams to the proper area.

===Radar and radio system===
Standard equipment for the armed T-2(K) included a Mitsubishi Electric J/AWG-11 search and ranging radar in the nose; a French Thomson-CSF heads-up display (HUD), license-built by Mitsubishi Electric; a Lear-Siegler 501OBL automatic heading and reference system (AHRS); as well as a UHF radio, an identification friend or foe (IFF) system, and a TACAN radio beacon navigation receiver system, all built in Japan. The J/AWG-11 was basically a member of the family of radars fitted to the U.S. F-4 Phantom, being very similar to the AN/AWG-11 fitted to the British Royal Navy Phantom FG.1. The unarmed T-2(Z) lacked the radar, though apparently its avionics kit was otherwise the same as that of the T-2(K).

==Operational history==
The XT-2 was redesignated T-2 on 29 August 1973, entering service in 1975, with the first unit, the 21st &quot;Hikōtai&quot; becoming fully operational on 1 October 1976, with a second squadron, the 22nd &quot;Hikōtai&quot; following on 5 April 1978, allowing the North American F-86 Sabre to be phased out of the advanced training role. The &quot;Blue Impulse&quot; aerobatic display team of the JASDF re-equipped with the T-2 in the winter of 1981–82. T-2s were also used by a dedicated Aggressor squadron, being replaced by the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. T-2s were also used as conversion trainers for squadrons operating the Mitsubishi F-1, a development of the T-2.

The T-2 was retired by 2006, being replaced as an advanced trainer by the Kawasaki T-4 and as a conversion trainer by a two-seat version of the Mitsubishi F-2, which had replaced the F-1 in the anti-ship strike/ground attack role.

<doc id="563405" wikidata="Q1756477" url="?curid=563405" title="League system">
<text>A league system is a hierarchy of leagues in a sport. They are often called pyramids, due to their tendency to split into an increasing number of regional divisions further down the system. League systems of some sort are used in many sports in many countries.

==Overview==
In association football, rugby union, rugby league and Gaelic games, league systems are usually connected by the process of promotion and relegation, in which teams from a lower division who finish at the top of the standings in their league are promoted (advanced to the next level of the system) while teams who finish lowest in their division are relegated (move down to a lower division). This process can be automatic each year, or can require playoffs.

In North America, league systems in the most popular sports do not use promotion or relegation. Most professional sports are divided into major and minor leagues. Baseball and association football (known as soccer in North America) have well-defined pyramid shapes to their minor league hierarchies, each managed by a governing body (Minor League Baseball, an organization under the authority of the Commissioner of Baseball, governs baseball leagues; the United States Soccer Federation designates the American soccer pyramid.) Ice hockey&#x27;s professional minor league system is linear, with one league at most of the four levels of the game; the ice hockey league system in North America is governed by collective bargaining agreements and affiliation deals between the NHL, AHL and ECHL.

Gridiron football does not operate on a league system. Different professional leagues play by very different sets of rules in different seasons (the NFL plays 11-a-side on a 100-yard field in autumn and early winter, the CFL uses 12-a-side on a 110-yard field in summer and early fall, while arena football and the minor indoor leagues each play 8-a-side on a 50-yard field in the spring and early summer). There have been attempts at forming true minor leagues for the professional game (most recently with the United Football League in 2024, formed as a merger between the second incarnations of the XFL and USFL); none so far have been able to balance the major leagues&#x27; requests with the ability to maintain financial solvency.

== Impact ==
League systems can have a negative effect on competitive balance, particularly in European professional football.

<text>Blue-eyed soul (also called white soul) is rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) and soul music performed by White artists. The term was coined in the mid-1960s, to describe white artists whose sound was similar to that of the predominantly black Motown and Stax record labels. Though many R&amp;B radio stations in the United States in that period would only play music by Black musicians, some began to play music by white acts considered to have &quot;soul feeling&quot;; their music was then described as &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot;.

==1960s==

Georgie Woods, a Philadelphia radio DJ, is thought to have coined the term &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot; in 1964, initially to describe the Righteous Brothers, then white artists in general who received airplay on rhythm and blues radio stations. The Righteous Brothers in turn named their 1964 LP &quot;Some Blue-Eyed Soul&quot;. According to Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers, R&amp;B radio stations who played their songs were surprised to find them to be white when they turned up for interviews, and one DJ in Philadelphia (unnamed by Medley but probably Georgie Woods) started saying &quot;Here&#x27;s my blue-eyed soul brothers&quot;, and it became a code to signal to the audience that they were white singers. The popularity of the Righteous Brothers who had a hit with &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; is thought to have started the trend of R&amp;B radio stations to play songs by white artists in the mid-1960s, a more integrative approach that was then popular with their audience. The term blue-eyed soul was then applied to such artists as Sonny &amp; Cher, Tom Jones, Barry McGuire, and Roy Head.

White musicians playing R&amp;B music, however, began before the term blue-eyed soul was coined. For instance, in the early 1960s, one of the rare female blue-eyed soul singers was Timi Yuro, whose vocal delivery and repertoire were influenced by African-American singers such as Dinah Washington.
Lonnie Mack&#x27;s 1963 gospel-infused vocals earned him widespread critical acclaim as a blue-eyed soul singer. Len Barry, former lead singer on the Dovells, recorded blue-eyed soul hits in 1965 and 1966 for Decca Records in the US and released by Brunswick Records: &quot;1-2-3&quot;, &quot;Like a Baby&quot;, and &quot;I Struck It Rich&quot;, a song he wrote with Leon Huff of the Philadelphia International Records producers, Gamble and Huff. Groups such as the Rascals had soul-tinged pop songs, but it was the soulful vocals of Felix Cavaliere that gave them the blue-eyed soul sound. 

By the mid-1960s, British singers Dusty Springfield, Eric Burdon, and Tom Jones had become leading vocal stars of the emerging style. Other notable UK exponents of blue-eyed soul included the Spencer Davis Group (featuring Steve Winwood), Van Morrison, and archetypal mod band the Small Faces, whose sound was heavily influenced by the Stax label&#x27;s house band Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s. Blonde, blue-eyed soul singer Chris Clark became the first white singer to have an R&amp;B hit with &quot;Love&#x27;s Gone Bad&quot; with Motown Records in 1966. In 1969, Kiki Dee became the first British artist to sign and record with Motown. Some British rock groups of the 1960s – such as the Spencer Davis Group, the Rolling Stones (&quot;My Girl&quot;), and the Who (&quot;Heat Wave&quot;) – covered Motown and rhythm and blues tracks.

In 1967, Jerry Lee Lewis, whose latter days at Sun Records (1961–63) had been characterized by R&amp;B covers, recorded an album for Smash entitled &quot;Soul My Way&quot;. Elvis Presley released &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot; in 1969, an album of blue-eyed soul, southern soul and country soul. Delaney and Bonnie (Bramlett) produced the blue-eyed soul album &quot;Home&quot; on Stax in 1969. Michael Sembello, who left home at age 17 to tour with Stevie Wonder, wrote and performed on numerous blue-eyed soul hits for Wonder, Brian McKnight, David Sanborn, Bill Champlin, and Bobby Caldwell. Todd Rundgren began his career in Woody&#x27;s Truck Stop, a group based on the model of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band.

After splitting from Big Brother and the Holding Company, Janis Joplin formed a new backup group, the Kozmic Blues Band, composed of session musicians like keyboardist Stephen Ryder and saxophonist Cornelius &quot;Snooky&quot; Flowers, as well as former Big Brother and the Holding Company guitarist Sam Andrew and future Full Tilt Boogie Band bassist Brad Campbell. The band was influenced by the Stax-Volt rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) and soul bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays.

Joe Cocker, who sang soul-oriented covers of songs such as &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, was said by the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; to have &quot;opened the door for all blue-eyed soul singers after him&quot;.

==1970s==
Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds and the Grass Roots both had successful blue-eyed soul singles; the former with &quot;Don&#x27;t Pull Your Love&quot; (1971) and the latter with &quot;Two Divided by Love&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Runway&quot; (1972). In 1973, the American band Stories and the Canadian group Skylark had successes with their respective blue-eyed soul singles &quot;Brother Louie&quot; and &quot;Wildflower&quot;. In February 1975, Tower of Power became the first white/mixed act to appear on &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Also in 1975, David Bowie, another early white artist to appear on &quot;Soul Train&quot;, released &quot;Young Americans&quot;, a popular blue-eyed soul album which Bowie himself called &quot;plastic soul&quot;. It featured the funk-inspired &quot;Fame&quot;, which became Bowie&#x27;s first number-one hit in the US. Hall &amp; Oates&#x27; 1975 &quot;Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates&quot; includes the ballad &quot;Sara Smile&quot;, long considered a blue-eyed soul standard. &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;, another soulful hit, was originally released in 1973 but did better as a re-release after &quot;Sara Smile&quot;. Bobby Caldwell, one of the most notable purveyors of blue-eyed soul, released his enduring hit &quot;What You Won&#x27;t Do for Love&quot; in 1978.

== 1980s ==
Blue-eyed soul music&#x27;s chart success was at its highest when Hall and Oates&#x27; singles got heavy airplay on urban contemporary radio, as was the case with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go for That (No Can Do)&quot;, &quot;Kiss on My List&quot;, &quot;One on One&quot;, &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot;, &quot;Adult Education&quot;, &quot;Out of Touch&quot;, &quot;Method of Modern Love&quot;, and &quot;Everytime You Go Away&quot;. Most of those singles charted on the R&amp;B and dance charts, including some number-one hits. In 1985, Simply Red released &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot;, one of the most successful blue-eyed soul ballads; &quot;Money&#x27;s Too Tight (to Mention)&quot; and other singles by the group also performed well.

Other successful blue-eyed soul songs of the 1980s include Phil Collins&#x27; cover of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; (1982); Culture Club&#x27;s &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot; (1982), &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart)&quot; (1982) and &quot;Church of the Poison Mind&quot; (1983); Dexys Midnight Runners&#x27; &quot;Come On Eileen&quot; (1983); the Style Council&#x27;s &quot;Shout to the Top&quot; (1984); Teena Marie&#x27;s &quot;Lovergirl&quot; (1985); Paul Young&#x27;s &quot;Every Time You Go Away&quot; (1985); Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Missionary Man&quot; (1986), and Steve Winwood&#x27;s &quot;Roll with It&quot; (1988). As the decade drew to a close, British artist Lisa Stansfield had considerable success on R&amp;B radio, scoring three number-one R&amp;B hits, the most popular being &quot;All Around the World&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, George Michael found some success in the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs with hit singles such as &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; and &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; but it was not until he reinvented himself as a white soul singer with the release of his multi-platinum album &quot;Faith&quot; (1987). The album was notable for slowly climbing to the top of the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it the first album by a white artist to hit the top spot on that chart, mainly due to the gospel-influenced singles that were released from the album, most notably &quot;Father Figure&quot; and &quot;One More Try&quot;. In 1989, he racked up three wins in the American Music Awards including Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Male Artist and Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album for &quot;Faith&quot;.

== 1990s ==
Dance-pop singer Rick Astley shifted to blue-eyed soul and adult contemporary in the early 1990s with &quot;Free&quot;, featuring the hit &quot;Cry for Help&quot;.

== 2000s and 2010s ==
Joss Stone received acclaim after releasing her first album &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; in 2003. Scottish musician Paolo Nutini whose first two albums influenced by soul music are certified quintuple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. Adele&#x27;s debut album &quot;19&quot; was a global success.
== Criticism ==
A backlash ensued in the late 1980s as some black people felt that white people were cashing in on the popularity of their music. The extent of the backlash, however, was not universally agreed upon. In 1989, &quot;Ebony Magazine&quot; published an article exploring whether white people were &quot;taking over&quot; R&amp;B. The article featured various members of the music industry, both black and white, who believed collaboration was a unifying force, and there was agreement that the future of R&amp;B was not compromised by the contemporary urban sound. A similar article in &quot;Ebony&quot;, written in 1999 highlighted conflicting opinions about the &quot;blue-eyed&quot; influence; however, the source of contention was not about the artistic merit of blue-eyed soul, but rather the economic inequality that persisted in American life and within the music industry.

According to scholar Joanna Teresa Demers, the &quot;successors [of Presley] in blue-eyed soul and white funk&quot; embittered poet Gil Scott-Heron, as it proved that &quot;blacks were still being victimized by cultural appropriation, making their contributions to American history virtually invisible and inaudible.&quot; The &quot;long tradition of white co-optation of black cultural identity&quot; since Elvis amounting to &quot;artistic theft&quot; was, in Scott-Heron&#x27;s words, &quot;no new thing.&quot;

Daryl Hall has described the term &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot; as racist, saying &quot;it assumes I&#x27;m coming from the outside. There&#x27;s always been that thing in America, where if you&#x27;re a white guy and you&#x27;re singing or playing in a black idiom, it&#x27;s like: &#x27;Why is he doing that? Is he from the outside, looking in? Is he copying? What&#x27;s the point of it?&#x27; C&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s music! It&#x27;s music.&quot;

<doc id="563439" wikidata="Q1575129" url="?curid=563439" title="Controlled natural language">
<text>Controlled natural languages (CNLs) are subsets of natural languages that are obtained by restricting the grammar and vocabulary in order to reduce or eliminate ambiguity and complexity. Traditionally, controlled languages fall into two major types: those that improve readability for human readers (e.g. non-native speakers),
and those that enable reliable automatic semantic analysis of the language.

The first type of languages (often called &quot;simplified&quot; or &quot;technical&quot; languages), for example ASD Simplified Technical English, Caterpillar Technical English, IBM&#x27;s Easy English, are used in the industry to increase the quality of technical documentation, and possibly simplify the semi-automatic translation of the documentation. These languages restrict the writer by general rules such as &quot;Keep sentences short&quot;, &quot;Avoid the use of pronouns&quot;, &quot;Only use dictionary-approved words&quot;, and &quot;Use only the active voice&quot;.

The second type of languages have a formal syntax and formal semantics, and can be mapped to an existing formal language, such as first-order logic. Thus, those languages can be used as knowledge representation languages, and writing of those languages is supported by fully automatic consistency and redundancy checks, query answering, etc.

==Languages==
Existing controlled natural languages include:
* ASD Simplified Technical English
* Attempto Controlled English
* Aviation English
* Basic English
* ClearTalk
* Common Logic Controlled English
* Distributed Language Translation Esperanto
* Easy Japanese
* E-Prime
* Français fondamental
* Gellish Formal English
* Interlingua-IL sive Latino sine flexione (Giuseppe Peano)
* Logical English
* ModeLang
* Newspeak (fictional)
* Processable English (PENG)
* Seaspeak
* Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules
* Special English
==Encoding==
IETF has reserved as a BCP 47 variant subtag for simplified versions of languages.

<text>Bethel University is a private Cumberland Presbyterian-affiliated university in McKenzie, Tennessee with satellite campuses in Jackson, and Paris. It is accredited to award degrees up to the master&#x27;s level.

== History ==

=== Founding in McLemoresville ===
Bethel Seminary was founded in 1842 in McLemoresville, Tennessee, and renamed to Bethel College in 1847. The seminary was overseen by the West Tennessee Synod of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, who also oversaw 82 other schools at varying points in its own history. In 1851, the West Tennessee Synod founded a Theology Department at the school. This was prompted by other schools attempting to start theology departments in order to acquire more support from church leadership.

The school closed in 1861 due to the start of the American Civil War. The building were used as barracks by both the American and Confederate armies during the conflict. An interesting anecdote involved a large refracting telescope that was captured by the U.S. troops who thought it the barrel of a brass cannon. The telescope was later returned to the college by the troops and is still reportedly in the care of the college. The school reopened in 1869.
=== Move to McKenzie ===
In 1872, Bethel President W.W. Hendrix led the initiative to move Bethel from McLemoresville to its current location in McKenzie, where the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway intersected the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railway. A large, 2.5 story brick building was erected on the north side of town, on land purchased from local James M. McKenzie.

In the 1920s, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church implemented upgrades to the school, expanding the campus and curriculum. This was aided by a donation from the estate of Iowa businessman John T. Laughlin, who bequeathed $100k to the church in his will. From 1924 to 1928, an additional four buildings were constructed on the campus. The new administration building, a 2.5 story brick building, was designed by Missouri architect A. F. Lindsey.

In May 1975, comedian Bob Hope made an appearance at Bethel College as part of a fundraiser for the school.

=== Renamed to Bethel University ===
The school assumed its current name in 2009. On August 4, 2014, Bethel University and the Board of Trustees officially announced Walter Butler as its 40th president, a position he held on an interim basis since August 1, 2013 after longtime President Robert Prosser retired.

In the 2010s, Bethel University began renovating and building new facilities to accommodate its rapidly growing enrollment numbers. This included a new student center, football stadium, three new dorm buildings, and a new basketball arena. Additionally, the seminary, library, and old cafeteria buildings were extensively renovated to serve the changing needs of the school&#x27;s academic programs.

On May 8, 2010, the university held a dedication service for its newest building, the Ray and Linda Morris Science Complex, featuring new laboratories, additional classrooms, and a lecture hall. Also dedicated that year was a new residence hall, University Hall, which houses up to 250 students.

June the following year saw the reopening of the Odom Hall math building after extensive renovations, along with Heritage Hall, a new three-story residence hall which was dedicated in August 2011.

The university&#x27;s most ambitious construction plan also saw its first of four phases completed in August 2011. Phase I of the Vera Low Center for Student Enrichment features a new cafeteria, student services offices, bookstore, enrollment offices and a student activities room. Phase II of the Rosemary and Harry L. Crisp Arena, which opened in Spring 2012, consists of a new gymnasium, athletic training facilities, offices, and a fitness center for students, faculty, and general public. Phase III, the Cumberland Chapel, was under construction .

In conjunction with the Henry County Medical Center, in November 2012, Bethel University opened its new satellite campus for the Physician Assistant Program along with the medical centers&#x27; new Diagnostic Center.

== Student body ==
The bulk of students attending Bethel University are residents of Tennessee, but the student body typically represents students from 45 states and 25 countries. Bethel Seminary&#x27;s enrollment in 1852 was 172. Bethel College&#x27;s enrollment in 1955 was believed to be about 460 students. Bethel University student enrollment as of Fall 2017 consisted of 4,579 students.

== Academics ==
Bethel University consists of three colleges: the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, the College of Professional Studies, and the College of Health Sciences. The university offers Associates, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Arts, Master of Business Administration, and Master of Science degrees through a variety of academic programs. Since 1988, it has hosted the two-day academically based Hendrix Scholarship Competition offering full tuition and board for the winner, with full tuition for the runner up. Students who qualify may enter the Honors program, receiving a $10,000 scholarship per academic year.

Bethel University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

== Arts ==
Music, drama and performing arts are organized through a variety of entities within Bethel University. The academic branch of Bethel University houses the department of music, as well as the department of theatre. The department of music offers academic classes that fulfill requirements for graduation in the areas of music education, music performance, music business, and church music. Music performing ensembles found in the department of music include the Wildcat Marching Band, Academic Concert Symphonic Band, Academic Wind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, Brazilian Drum Ensemble, Brass Ensemble, Jazz Band, Choir (Bethel University Singers,) Chamber Choir, and various student-led performing groups.

<text>Methanogens are anaerobic archaea that produce methane as a byproduct of their energy metabolism, i.e., catabolism. Methane production, or methanogenesis, is the only biochemical pathway for ATP generation in methanogens. All known methanogens belong exclusively to the domain Archaea, although some bacteria, plants, and animal cells are also known to produce methane. However, the biochemical pathway for methane production in these organisms differs from that in methanogens and does not contribute to ATP formation. Methanogens belong to various phyla within the domain Archaea. Previous studies placed all known methanogens into the superphylum Euryarchaeota. However, recent phylogenomic data have led to their reclassification into several different phyla. Methanogens are common in various anoxic environments, such as marine and freshwater sediments, wetlands, the digestive tracts of animals, wastewater treatment plants, rice paddy soil, and landfills. While some methanogens are extremophiles, such as &quot;Methanopyrus kandleri&quot;, which grows between 84 and 110°C, or &quot;Methanonatronarchaeum thermophilum&quot;, which grows at a pH range of 8.2 to 10.2 and a concentration of 3 to 4.8 M, most of the isolates are mesophilic and grow around neutral pH.

==Physical description==

Methanogens are usually cocci (spherical) or rods (cylindrical) in shape, but long filaments (&quot;Methanobrevibacter filliformis&quot;, &quot;Methanospirillum hungatei&quot;) and curved forms (&quot;Methanobrevibacter curvatus&quot;, &quot;Methanobrevibacter cuticularis&quot;) also occur. There are over 150 described species of methanogens, which do not form a monophyletic group in the phylum Euryarchaeota (see Taxonomy). They are exclusively anaerobic organisms that cannot function under aerobic conditions due to the extreme oxygen sensitivity of methanogenesis enzymes and FeS clusters involved in ATP production. However, the degree of oxygen sensitivity varies, as methanogenesis has often been detected in temporarily oxygenated environments such as rice paddy soil, and various molecular mechanisms potentially involved in oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification have been proposed. For instance, a recently identified species &quot;Candidatus&quot; Methanothrix paradoxum common in wetlands and soil can function in anoxic microsites within aerobic environments but it is sensitive to the presence of oxygen even at trace level and cannot usually sustain oxygen stress for a prolonged time. However, &quot;Methanosarcina barkeri&quot; from a sister family Methanosarcinaceae is exceptional in possessing a superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme, and may survive longer than the others in the presence of O2. 

As is the case for other archaea, methanogens lack peptidoglycan, a polymer that is found in the cell walls of bacteria. Instead, some methanogens have a cell wall formed by pseudopeptidoglycan (also known as pseudomurein). Other methanogens have a paracrystalline protein array (S-layer) that fits together like a jigsaw puzzle. In some lineages there are less common types of cell envelope such as the proteinaceous sheath of &quot;Methanospirillum&quot; or the methanochondroitin of &quot;Methanosarcina&quot; aggregated cells.

==Ecology==
In anaerobic environments, methanogens play a vital ecological role, removing excess hydrogen and fermentation products that have been produced by other forms of anaerobic respiration. Methanogens typically thrive in environments in which all electron acceptors other than CO2 (such as oxygen, nitrate, ferric iron (Fe(III)), and sulfate) have been depleted. Such environments include wetlands and rice paddy soil, the digestive tracts of various animals (ruminants, arthropods, humans), wastewater treatment plants and landfills, deep-water oceanic sediments, and hydrothermal vents. Most of these environments are not categorized as extreme, and thus the methanogens inhabiting them are also not considered extremophiles. However, many well-studied methanogens are thermophiles such as &quot;Methanopyrus kandleri&quot;, &quot;Methanothermobacter marburgensis&quot;, &quot;Methanocaldococcus jannaschii&quot;. On the other hand, gut methanogens such as &quot;Methanobrevibacter smithii&quot; common in humans or &quot;Methanobrevibacter ruminantium&quot; omnipresent in ruminants are mesophiles.

=== Methanogens in extreme environments ===
In deep basaltic rocks near the mid-ocean ridges, methanogens can obtain their hydrogen from the serpentinization reaction of olivine as observed in the hydrothermal field of Lost City. The thermal breakdown of water and water radiolysis are other possible sources of hydrogen. Methanogens are key agents of remineralization of organic carbon in continental margin sediments and other aquatic sediments with high rates of sedimentation and high sediment organic matter. Under the correct conditions of pressure and temperature, biogenic methane can accumulate in massive deposits of methane clathrates that account for a significant fraction of organic carbon in continental margin sediments and represent a key reservoir of a potent greenhouse gas.

Methanogens have been found in several extreme environments on Earth – buried under kilometres of ice in Greenland and living in hot, dry desert soil. They are known to be the most common archaea in deep subterranean habitats. Live microbes making methane were found in a glacial ice core sample retrieved from about three kilometres under Greenland by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley. They also found a constant metabolism able to repair macromolecular damage, at temperatures of 145 to –40 °C.

Another study has also discovered methanogens in a harsh environment on Earth. Researchers studied dozens of soil and vapour samples from five different desert environments in Utah, Idaho and California in the United States, and in Canada and Chile. Of these, five soil samples and three vapour samples from the vicinity of the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah were found to have signs of viable methanogens.

Some scientists have proposed that the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere may be indicative of native methanogens on that planet. In June 2019, NASA&#x27;s Curiosity rover detected methane, commonly generated by underground microbes such as methanogens, which signals possibility of life on Mars.

Closely related to the methanogens are the anaerobic methane oxidizers, which utilize methane as a substrate in conjunction with the reduction of sulfate and nitrate. Most methanogens are autotrophic producers, but those that oxidize CH3COO− are classed as chemotroph instead.

=== Methanogens in the digestive tract of animals ===
The digestive tract of animals is characterized by a nutrient-rich and predominantly anaerobic environment, making it an ideal habitat for many microbes, including methanogens. Despite this, methanogens and archaea, in general, were largely overlooked as part of the gut microbiota until recently. However, they play a crucial role in maintaining gut balance by utilizing end products of bacterial fermentation, such as H2, acetate, methanol, and methylamines.

Recent extensive surveys of archaea presence in the animal gut, based on 16S rRNA analysis, have provided a comprehensive view of archaea diversity and abundance. These studies revealed that only a few archaeal lineages are present, with the majority being methanogens, while non-methanogenic archaea are rare and not abundant. Taxonomic classification of archaeal diversity identified that representatives of only three phyla are present in the digestive tracts of animals: Methanobacteriota (order Methanobacteriales), Thermoplasmatota (order Methanomassiliicoccales), and Halobacteriota (orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales). However, not all families and genera within these orders were detected in animal guts, but only a few genera, suggesting their specific adaptations to the gut environment.

==Comparative genomics and molecular signatures==

Comparative proteomic analysis has led to the identification of 31 signature proteins which are specific for methanogens (also known as Methanoarchaeota). Most of these proteins are related to methanogenesis, and they could serve as potential molecular markers for methanogens. Additionally, 10 proteins found in all methanogens, which are shared by &quot;Archaeoglobus&quot;, suggest that these two groups are related. In phylogenetic trees, methanogens are not monophyletic and they are generally split into three clades. Hence, the unique shared presence of large numbers of proteins by all methanogens could be due to lateral gene transfers. Additionally, more recent novel proteins associated with sulfide trafficking have been linked to methanogen archaea. More proteomic analysis is needed to further differentiate specific genera within the methanogen class and reveal novel pathways for methanogenic metabolism.

Modern DNA or RNA sequencing approaches has elucidated several genomic markers specific to several groups of methanogens. One such finding isolated nine methanogens from genus Methanoculleus and found that there were at least 2 trehalose synthases genes that were found in all nine genomes. Thus far, the gene has been observed only in this genus, therefore it can be used as a marker to identify the archaea Methanoculleus. As sequencing techniques progress and databases become populated with an abundance of genomic data, a greater number of strains and traits can be identified, but many genera have remained understudied. For example, halophilic methanogens are potentially important microbes for carbon cycling in coastal wetland ecosystems but seem to be greatly understudied. One recent publication isolated a novel strain from genus &quot;Methanohalophilus&quot; which resides in sulfide-rich seawater. Interestingly, they have isolated several portions of this strain&#x27;s genome that are different from other isolated strains of this genus (&quot;Methanohalophilus mahii&quot;, &quot;Methanohalophilus halophilus&quot;, &quot;Methanohalophilus portucalensis&quot;, &quot;Methanohalophilus euhalbius&quot;). Some differences include a highly conserved genome, sulfur and glycogen metabolisms and viral resistance. Genomic markers consistent with the microbes environment have been observed in many other cases. One such study found that methane producing archaea found in hydraulic fracturing zones had genomes which varied with vertical depth. Subsurface and surface genomes varied along with the constraints found in individual depth zones, though fine-scale diversity was also found in this study. Genomic markers pointing at environmentally relevant factors are often non-exclusive. A survey of Methanogenic Thermoplasmata has found these organisms in human and animal intestinal tracts. This novel species was also found in other methanogenic environments such as wetland soils, though the group isolated in the wetlands did tend to have a larger number of genes encoding for anti-oxidation enzymes that were not present in the same group isolated in the human and animal intestinal tract. A common issue with identifying and discovering novel species of methanogens is that sometimes the genomic differences can be quite small, yet the research group decides they are different enough to separate into individual species. One study took a group of Methanocellales and ran a comparative genomic study. The three strains were originally considered identical, but a detailed approach to genomic isolation showed differences among their previously considered identical genomes. Differences were seen in gene copy number and there was also metabolic diversity associated with the genomic information.

Genomic signatures not only allow one to mark unique methanogens and genes relevant to environmental conditions; it has also led to a better understanding of the evolution of these archaea. Some methanogens must actively mitigate against oxic environments. Functional genes involved with the production of antioxidants have been found in methanogens, and some specific groups tend to have an enrichment of this genomic feature. Methanogens containing a genome with enriched antioxidant properties may provide evidence that this genomic addition may have occurred during the Great Oxygenation Event. In another study, three strains from the lineage Thermoplasmatales isolated from animal gastro-intestinal tracts revealed evolutionary differences. The eukaryotic-like histone gene which is present in most methanogen genomes was not present, alluding to evidence that an ancestral branch was lost within Thermoplasmatales and related lineages. Furthermore, the group Methanomassiliicoccus has a genome which appears to have lost many common genes coding for the first several steps of methanogenesis. These genes appear to have been replaced by genes coding for a novel methylated methogenic pathway. This pathway has been reported in several types of environments, pointing to non-environment specific evolution, and may point to an ancestral deviation.

== Metabolism ==

=== Methane production ===
Methanogens are known to produce methane from substrates such as H2/CO2, acetate, formate, methanol and methylamines in a process called methanogenesis. Different methanogenic reactions are catalyzed by unique sets of enzymes and coenzymes. While reaction mechanism and energetics vary between one reaction and another, all of these reactions contribute to net positive energy production by creating ion concentration gradients that are used to drive ATP synthesis. The overall reaction for H2/CO2 methanogenesis is:

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + 4 H2 -&gt; CH4 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt; (∆G˚’ = -134 kJ/mol CH4)

Well-studied organisms that produce methane via H2/CO2 methanogenesis include &quot;Methanosarcina barkeri&quot;, &quot;Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum&quot;, and &quot;Methanobacterium wolfei&quot;. These organisms are typically found in anaerobic environments.

In the earliest stage of H2/CO2 methanogenesis, CO2 binds to methanofuran (MF) and is reduced to formyl-MF. This endergonic reductive process (∆G˚’= +16 kJ/mol) is dependent on the availability of H2 and is catalyzed by the enzyme formyl-MF dehydrogenase.

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + H2 + MF -&gt; HCO-MF + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The formyl constituent of formyl-MF is then transferred to the coenzyme tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) and is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme known as formyltransferase. This results in the formation of formyl-H4MPT.

:&lt;chem&gt;HCO-MF + H4MPT -&gt; HCO-H4MPT + MF&lt;/chem&gt;

Formyl-H4MPT is subsequently reduced to methenyl-H4MPT. Methenyl-H4MPT then undergoes a one-step hydrolysis followed by a two-step reduction to methyl-H4MPT. The two-step reversible reduction is assisted by coenzyme F420 whose hydride acceptor spontaneously oxidizes. Once oxidized, F420’s electron supply is replenished by accepting electrons from H2. This step is catalyzed by methylene H4MPT dehydrogenase.

:&lt;chem&gt;HCO-H4MPT + H+ -&gt; CH-H4MPT+ + H2O&lt;/chem&gt; (Formyl-H4MPT reduction)

:&lt;chem&gt;CH-H4MPT+ + F420H2 -&gt; CH2=H4MPT + F420 + H+&lt;/chem&gt;(Methenyl-H4MPT hydrolysis)

:&lt;chem&gt;CH2=H4MPT + H2 -&gt; CH3-H4MPT + H+&lt;/chem&gt;(H4MPT reduction)

Next, the methyl group of methyl-M4MPT is transferred to coenzyme M via a methyltransferase-catalyzed reaction.

:&lt;chem&gt;CH3-H4MPT + HS-CoM -&gt; CH3-S-CoM + H4MPT&lt;/chem&gt;

The final step of H2/CO2 methanogenic involves methyl-coenzyme M reductase and two coenzymes: N-7 mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate (HS-HTP) and coenzyme F430. HS-HTP donates electrons to methyl-coenzyme M allowing the formation of methane and mixed disulfide of HS-CoM. F430, on the other hand, serves as a prosthetic group to the reductase. H2 donates electrons to the mixed disulfide of HS-CoM and regenerates coenzyme M.

:&lt;chem&gt;CH3-S-CoM + HS-HTP -&gt; CH4 + CoM-S-S-HTP&lt;/chem&gt; (Formation of methane)

:&lt;chem&gt;CoM-S-S-HTP + H2 -&gt; HS-CoM + HS-HTP&lt;/chem&gt; (Regeneration of coenzyme M)

== Biotechnological application ==

=== Wastewater treatment ===
Methanogens are widely used in anaerobic digestors to treat wastewater as well as aqueous organic pollutants. Industries have selected methanogens for their ability to perform biomethanation during wastewater decomposition thereby rendering the process sustainable and cost-effective.

Bio-decomposition in the anaerobic digester involves a four-staged cooperative action performed by different microorganisms. The first stage is the hydrolysis of insoluble polymerized organic matter by anaerobes such as Streptococcus and Enterobacterium. In the second stage, acidogens break down dissolved organic pollutants in wastewater to fatty acids. In the third stage, acetogens convert fatty acids to acetates. In the final stage, methanogens metabolize acetates to gaseous methane. The byproduct methane leaves the aqueous layer and serves as an energy source to power wastewater-processing within the digestor, thus generating a self-sustaining mechanism.

Methanogens also effectively decrease the concentration of organic matter in wastewater run-off. For instance, agricultural wastewater, highly rich in organic material, has been a major cause of aquatic ecosystem degradation. The chemical imbalances can lead to severe ramifications such as eutrophication. Through anaerobic digestion, the purification of wastewater can prevent unexpected blooms in water systems as well as trap methanogenesis within digesters. This allocates biomethane for energy production and prevents a potent greenhouse gas, methane, from being released into the atmosphere.

The organic components of wastewater vary vastly. Chemical structures of the organic matter select for specific methanogens to perform anaerobic digestion. An example is the members of &quot;Methanosaeta&quot; genus dominate the digestion of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and brewery waste. Modernizing wastewater treatment systems to incorporate higher diversity of microorganisms to decrease organic content in treatment is under active research in the field of microbiological and chemical engineering. Current new generations of Staged Multi-Phase Anaerobic reactors and Upflow Sludge Bed reactor systems are designed to have innovated features to counter high loading wastewater input, extreme temperature conditions, and possible inhibitory compounds.

== Taxonomy ==

Initially, methanogens were considered to be bacteria, as it was not possible to distinguish archaea and bacteria before the introduction of molecular techniques such as DNA sequencing and PCR. Since the introduction of the domain Archaea by Carl Woese in 1977, methanogens were for a prolonged period considered a monophyletic group, later named Euryarchaeota (super)phylum. However, intensive studies of various environments have proved that there are more and more non-methanogenic lineages among methanogenic ones.

The development of genome sequencing directly from environmental samples (metagenomics) allowed the discovery of the first methanogens outside the Euryarchaeota superphylum. The first such putative methanogenic lineage was Bathyarchaeia, a class within the Thermoproteota phylum. Later, it was shown that this lineage is not methanogenic but alkane-oxidizing utilizing highly divergent enzyme Acr similar to the hallmark gene of methanogenesis, methyl-CoM reductase (McrABG). The first isolate of Bathyarchaeum tardum from sediment of coastal lake in Russia showed that it metabolizes aromatic compounds and proteins as it was previously predicted based on metagenomic studies. However, more new putative methanogens outside of Euryarchaeota were discovered based on the presence McrABG.

For instance, methanogens were found in the phyla Thermoproteota (orders Methanomethyliales, Korarchaeales, Methanohydrogenales, Nezhaarchaeales) and Methanobacteriota_B (order Methanofastidiosales). Additionally, some new lineages of methanogens were isolated in pure culture, which allowed the discovery of a new type of methanogenesis: H2-dependent methyl-reducing methanogenesis, which is independent of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. For example, in 2012, the order Methanoplasmatales from the phylum Thermoplasmatota was described as a seventh order of methanogens. Later, the order was renamed Methanomassiliicoccales based on the isolated from human gut &quot;Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis&quot;.

Another new lineage in the Halobacteriota phylum, order Methanonatronarchaeales, was discovered in alkaline saline lakes in Siberia in 2017. It also employs H2-dependent methyl-reducing methanogenesis but intriguingly harbors almost the full Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. However, it is disconnected from McrABG as no MtrA-H complex was detected.

The taxonomy of methanogens reflects the evolution of these archaea, with some studies suggesting that the Last Archaeal Common Ancestor was methanogenic. If correct, this suggests that many archaeal lineages lost the ability to produce methane and switched to other types of metabolism. Currently, most of the isolated methanogens belong to one of three archaeal phyla (classification GTDB release 220): Halobacteriota, Methanobacteriota, and Thermoplasmatota. Under the International Code of Nomenclature for Prokaryotes, all three phyla belong to the same kingdom, Methanobacteriati. In total, more than 150 methanogen species are known in culture, with some represented by more than one strain.

<text>Bethel University is a private Baptist Christian university and seminary in Arden Hills, Minnesota, United States. It was founded in 1871 as a seminary and is affiliated with Converge. The university enrolls 5,600 students in undergraduate, graduate, and seminary programs. Its main campus is situated on about 290 acres on the east side of Lake Valentine just south of Interstate 694.

==History==

Bethel University has its origins in the Baptist Theological Union&#x27;s Swedish Seminary (Baptist Union Theological Seminary), which was founded by Swedish Baptist pastor John Alexis Edgren in Chicago, Illinois in 1871. Edgren was a former mariner and Civil War veteran originally from Ostana, Sweden, and founded the school as a place for Swedish Baptists to enter the ministry. Edgren was pastor of the First Swedish Baptist Church of Chicago and worked with the Baptist Theological Union to found the seminary. The first woman, Elizabeth Johnson, matriculated in 1879. The school moved several times, first from Morgan Park, Illinois, to St. Paul, Minnesota, then to Stomsburg, Nebraska, and then back to Morgan Park in 1888.
In 1914, the Baptist General Conference has become the school&#x27;s main partner. The seminary merged with Bethel Academy and relocated its campus to Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1931, the Academy became Bethel Junior College. The addition of a four-year liberal arts college program created Bethel College and Seminary in 1947. The school relocated from St. Paul to Arden Hills, Minnesota in 1972. In 2004, the institution changed its name to Bethel University.

==Academics==
The university offers degree programs through four different schools. The College of Arts and Sciences is its traditional undergraduate program, Bethel offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 106 majors and emphases of study, 43 minors, and 11 pre-professional programs. The College of Adults &amp; Professional Studies offers associate degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and a number of certificate programs. Through its graduate school, Bethel offers ten master&#x27;s degrees, including a physician assistant program, as well as a doctorate in educational leadership. Bethel also offers a number of graduate certificate programs and licenses.

===Seminary===
The school&#x27;s seminary, called Bethel Theological Seminary, is located primarily on the Arden Hills campus. It also has a location in San Diego and offers a number of fully online programs. It offers Master of Divinity (M.Div.) and Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) degrees, along with several Master of Arts (MA) and certificate programs.

=== Accreditations ===
Bethel has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1959. Its nursing program is approved by the Minnesota Board of Nursing. Bethel&#x27;s business program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs.

==Arden Hills campus==
===Academic buildings===
There are six main academic buildings located at the center of Bethel University&#x27;s main campus in Arden Hills, Minnesota. They run from southwest to northeast and are connected on the first three floors by weather-protected skyways and tunnels.

Starting from the Southwest and running to the Northeast, the buildings are as follows (with abbreviations in parentheses): Benson Great Hall and Lundquist Community Life Center (CLC), Barnes Academic Center (BAC), Brushaber Commons (BC), Clauson Fine Arts Center (CC), Hagstrom Student Services Center (HC), and Robertson Physical Education Center (RC).

===On-campus housing===
==== Freshman residences ====
There are four freshman residence halls on campus. Three—Bodien Hall, Getsch Hall, and Edgren Hall—encircle a cul-de-sac just south of the academic buildings, informally known as Freshman Hill. The fourth, Nelson Hall, is the largest of the freshman residences, and located nearby on the north side of the academic buildings. It is the oldest building on Bethel University&#x27;s current campus in Arden Hills.

==== Residences for returning students ====
Two residence halls, Arden Village and Lissner Hall, mostly house returning students. North Village, a collection of five buildings formerly used as housing for seminary students, houses returning students and offers a full kitchen in every suite. It is located at the far north end of the campus. Heritage Hall, opened in 1999, is a suite-style residence hall, housing juniors and seniors. Students enrolling after Fall 2019 must be 21 years of age prior to September 1 to live off-campus with the exception of those who commute from their parents&#x27; home.

===Brushaber Commons===

The Brushaber Commons, a $30 million, 106,000-square foot student commons area, opened in 2009. The Brushaber Commons is named after retired Bethel President George K. Brushaber. In addition to serving as a gathering point for students, the commons includes a dining center, coffee shop, restaurant, campus store, office space, public meeting areas, and an admissions center.

=== Benson Great Hall ===
Benson Great Hall, Bethel&#x27;s performing arts center, is a 1,700-seat concert hall with a 4,000-pipe Blackinton organ located in the center of the Lundquist Community Life Center. This hall houses worship services, theatre productions, and can be rented by outside performers. Benson Hall has hosted a variety of events in the past, providing a venue for Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, a location for high school graduations, and the 2018 Super Bowl Gospel Celebration. Benson Great Hall offers a green room, backstage dressing rooms and bathrooms, custom sound dampening, lighting, and set design for special events.

==Student life==
The university hymn is &quot;O God of Bethel, by Whose Hand&quot; by Philip Doddridge. A morning prayer chapel service is offered each class day, as well as vespers on Sunday evenings, but attendance is no longer mandatory.

=== Covenant for Life Together ===
All full-time students in the College of Arts and Sciences are expected to abide by the Covenant for Life Together. The Covenant is a lifestyle agreement that focuses on living a life of faith and personal morality. The Covenant emphasizes a respect for all persons and ethnic traditions and requires students to refrain from any sort of extramarital sex, homosexuality, pornography, gambling, illegal drugs, and tobacco in any form.

Under the Covenant for Life Together, students in the College of Arts and Sciences were initially prohibited from dancing or consuming alcohol year-round, but the rules were eventually relaxed to allow alcohol consumption when classes are not in session. Alcohol consumption by full-time students in the College of Arts and Sciences is still prohibited during the academic year.

=== Publications ===
Bethel University has a student news publication, &quot;The Clarion&quot;, which is printed during the school year and distributed on campus as well as online.

<text>Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics (PI, Perimeter, PITP) is an independent research centre in foundational theoretical physics located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1999. The institute&#x27;s founding and major benefactor is Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist Mike Lazaridis.

The original building, designed by Saucier + Perrotte, opened in 2004 and was awarded a Governor General&#x27;s Medal for Architecture in 2006. The Stephen Hawking Centre, designed by Teeple Architects, was opened in 2011 and was LEED Silver certified in 2015.

In addition to research, Perimeter also provides scientific training and educational outreach activities to the general public. This is done in part through Perimeter&#x27;s Educational Outreach team.

== History ==
In 1999, Howard Burton—who had a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Waterloo—emailed Mike Lazaridis along with 20 CEOs in an attempt to leave his Wall Street job. Lazaridis then pitched the idea of the Perimeter Institute to Burton as he wanted to use his BlackBerry wealth for a philanthropic endeavour. Lazaridis&#x27; initial donation of $100 million was announced on October 23, 2000, believed to be the biggest private donation in Canadian history to that point. Jim Balsille and Doug Fregin each donated $10 million. The city of Waterloo offered four sites of land for free; Lazaridis chose the former site of the Waterloo Memorial Arena (near Uptown Waterloo).

Research operations began in 2001, in a temporary site in a nearby post office. Burton became the Institute&#x27;s founding director. The permanent building&#x27;s construction finished in 2004. The Ontario budget, announced in March 2006, included a commitment to provide $50 million in funding to PI from the Ministry of Research and Innovation.

In May 2008, Dr. Neil Turok, a cosmologist, was appointed as Perimeter Institute&#x27;s second director replacing Howard Burton. Lazaridis donated a subsequent $50 million on June 4, 2008. In November 2008, it was announced that physicist Stephen Hawking would take the position of Distinguished Visiting Research Chair, a visiting position, at the institute.

Designed by Teeple Architects, a new expansion, the Stephen Hawking Centre at Perimeter Institute, was completed in September 2011. The centre&#x27;s grand opening was in September 2011 and included a video greeting from Hawking, who rarely traveled due to disability. This was the first-ever Gold Seal-managed project in Ontario, it attained LEED Silver certification in 2015.

On February 28, 2019, Dr. Robert Myers was appointed as the third director of the Perimeter Institute. On Nov 4, 2024, Marcela Carena was announced as the fourth director.

== Design ==
The Institute was designed by Montréal-based architectural firm Saucier + Perrotte. A concrete stairwell in the building&#x27;s atrium was designed by Blackwell Engineers. The Institute&#x27;s front aluminum wall is black with small windows to represent a blackboard. There are wooden fireplaces and blackboards throughout the building. Writing for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, architecture critic Lisa Rochon praised the Institute&#x27;s &quot;seamless connections&quot; between the building&#x27;s interior and exterior and said the building is about &quot;the flow of light and the directions we can take&quot;. Rochon described the building as modernism, and cited Tadao Ando as an influence.

== Research ==

Perimeter&#x27;s research encompasses nine fields:
* Cosmology
* Mathematical physics
* Particle Physics
* Quantum fields and strings
* Quantum foundations
* Quantum gravity
* Quantum information
* Quantum matter
* Strong gravity

== Programs ==

=== Perimeter Institute Recorded Seminar Archive (PIRSA) ===
An extensive, up-to-date archive of the institute&#x27;s varied research activities is readily available to the public via the internet. The Perimeter Institute Recorded Seminar Archive (PIRSA), is a permanent, free, searchable, and citable archive of recorded seminars, conferences, workshops and outreach events. Seminars with video and timed presentation materials can be accessed on-demand in Windows and Flash formats together with MP3 audio files and PDFs of the supporting materials. The PIRSA project is enlarged by the creation of SciTalks (See below).

=== SciTalks ===
After more than 13,000 talks uploaded to PIRSA, Perimeter Institute created in 2020 a new public video archive called SciTalks with the support of the Simons Foundations. It is a meta-repository search tool of scientific talks beyond what is produced at PI and aims to &quot;revolutionize the world of scholarly communication in the way that the arXiv has done for print scientific papers&quot;. Apart from PIRSA&#x27;s existing content, SciTalks indexes videos from other institutions, such as CERN, Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, ICTP and ICTP-SAIFR. As a meta-repository, SciTalks only stores metadata and links related to the videos, which are stored in other databases.

== Educational outreach ==

Perimeter&#x27;s educational outreach team&#x27;s activities include a monthly public lecture series, a two-week summer camp for the world&#x27;s top science students, a series of in-class resources, week-long professional development workshops for science teachers, cultural activities with local and international artists, an online archive of educational resources, an extensive network of science teachers to share content across Canada, and many other special events and science festivals contributing to physics outreach. Perimeter Institute operates an international outreach program. 

The annual EinsteinPlus summer school for high school physics teachers is held for one week each summer. The International Summer School for Young Physicists (ISSYP) is a physics camp for high school students. It brings approximately 20 Canadian students and 20 International students aged 16 – 18 to Perimeter for two weeks each year.

===Public lectures series===

Perimeter Institute has welcomed a number of very prominent scientists to deliver lectures on a wide variety of subjects. Lecturers have included: Freeman Dyson, Gerard ‘t Hooft, Jay Ingram, Seth Lloyd, Jay Melosh, Sir Roger Penrose, Michael Peskin, Leonard Susskind, Frank Wilczek and Anton Zeilinger.

===BrainSTEM: Your Future is Now===
This festival connected technological innovations to the scientific breakthroughs that make them possible. The festival, held September 30 to October 6, 2013, featured science-centre styled exhibits, special presentations, public lectures, Science in the Club events and insider-tours of the Perimeter Institute. Webcast Public Lectures featured James Grime, Ray Laflamme and Lucy Hawking.

===Quantum to Cosmos: Ideas for the Future festival===
Held in October, 2009, the Quantum to Cosmos: Ideas for the Future festival (Q2C Festival) was a science outreach event held in Canada. The festival included events and activities spanning: lectures, panel discussions, pub talks, cultural activities, a PI documentary premiere (The Quantum Tamers: Revealing Our Weird and Wired Future), sci-fi film festival, an art exhibit and the hugely popular Physica Phantastica exhibit centre, a space filled with demonstrations, hands-on activities, experiments and an immersive 3D tour of the universe narrated by Stephen Hawking.

The Q2C Festival attracted some 40,000 attendees (including over 6,000 in the secondary school program that brought students from Ontario and New York State and nearly one million viewers – and counting – through online streaming, video-on-demand services and special television broadcasts. Special editions of TVO’s “The Agenda with Steve Paikin&quot;, filmed live in PI&#x27;s Atrium in Waterloo attracted hundreds of thousands of viewers from across Canada with just five broadcasts.

==Training==

=== Joint masters-level program ===
In partnership with the University of Waterloo, PI conducts Perimeter Scholars International (PSI), a master&#x27;s level course in theoretical physics. The 10-month course was inaugurated in August 2009, and admits around 30 scholars per year. Students admitted (on average 3% of all applicants) receive full scholarships and living expenses. The master&#x27;s degree itself is issued by the University of Waterloo.

=== Doctoral studies ===
Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics also hosts PhD students wishing to pursue full-time graduate studies under the supervision of a PI faculty member. PhD students receive their doctoral degrees from a university partner, such as the University of Waterloo.

=== Courses ===
Perimeter Institute offers a number of planned courses each year, including cross-listed programs with universities and mini-courses given by PI faculty, associate faculty and visiting researchers. The courses are made available to all students enrolled in surrounding universities. The popular courses are attended by students from University of Waterloo, University of Western Ontario, McMaster University, University of Guelph, University of Toronto, York University, and other centres.

<text>The Life of the Cosmos is the debut non-fiction book by American theoretical physicist Lee Smolin. The book was initially published on January 1, 1997 by Oxford University Press.

==Overview==
In the book, Smolin details his fecund universes which applies the principle of natural selection to the birth of universes. Smolin posits that the collapse of black holes could lead to the creation of a new universe. This daughter universe would have fundamental constants and parameters similar to that of the parent universe though with some changes, providing for both inheritance and mutations as required by natural selection. However, while there is no direct analogue to Darwinian selective pressures, it is theorised that a universe with &quot;unsuccessful&quot; parameters will reach heat death before being able to reproduce, meaning that certain universal parameters become more likely than others.

==Review==
A staff-written review from popular-science publisher Jupiter Scientific said of the book:

<doc id="563484" wikidata="Q4818238" url="?curid=563484" title="Attenuated patella alta">
<text>Attenuated patella alta is an extremely rare condition affecting mobility and leg strength. It is characterized by an unusually small knee cap (patella) that develops out of and above the joint. Typically, as the knee cap sits in the joint, it is stimulated to growth by abrasion from the opposing bones. When not situated properly in the joint, the knee cap does not experience such stimulation and remains small and undeveloped. Note that the cartilage under and around the kneecap is eight times smoother than ice, so &quot;abrasion&quot; may not be the best term. 

A similar condition, patella alta, can occur as the result of a sports injury, though the large majority of the time it is a congenital/developmental condition that is unrelated to trauma. A kneecap in an &quot;alta&quot; position sits above the &quot;trochlear groove&quot; and therefore is less stable. The &quot;patellar tendon&quot; that connects the kneecap to the tibia (shinbone) is elongated (longer than normal). This cannot happen by way of trauma, unless there has been a rupture of the tendon and a less-than-optimal surgical repair.

There have been only three documented case of the disorder noted from birth. In 1988, three-year-old Eric Rogstad of Minneapolis, Minnesota was discovered to have the condition in both knees after several attempts by his parents and family physician to discover the cause of his difficulties with walking and running. After surgery and physical therapy, Eric gained the ability to walk and run without significant difficulty. Surprisingly, in 2016, two cases were discovered. 42 year old Anne Stone of Birmingham, England, and 27 year old Michael Brennan of Phoenix, Arizona, were independently diagnosed with bilateral attenuated patella alta.

Insall Ratio: This ratio is calculated with the knee flexed to 30 degrees. It is the ratio of the length of the patella to the length of the patellar tendon. Typically, this ratio is 1:1 but 20% variation represents patella alta or patella infera. Actually, the Insall-Salvati ratio can be measured at any degree of flexion, which is one reason for its popularity.

<doc id="563487" wikidata="Q2510524" url="?curid=563487" title="Scottish football league system">
<text>The Scottish football league system is a series of generally connected leagues for Scottish football clubs.

The Scottish system is more complicated than many other national league systems, consisting of several completely separate systems or &#x27;grades&#x27; of leagues and clubs. As well as senior football there is junior football, and also amateur football and welfare football.

In senior football in Scotland there is one national league, the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), which has four divisions. There are also several regional leagues (most notably the Highland Football League and since 2013 the Lowland Football League). From 2014–15, a promotion/relegation play-off between the two regional leagues and the SPFL national league was introduced for the first time.

Two clubs based in England play in the senior Scottish system - Berwick Rangers in the Lowland League and Tweedmouth Rangers in the East of Scotland League. A small number of English amateur clubs in the lowest levels of the game, based on or around the Anglo-Scottish border, also compete in Border Amateur Football League for geographical and travel reasons.

==Men&#x27;s system==
Until 2013 Scottish football had no pyramid league system, and as a result it was impossible for clubs in regional leagues to progress into the national leagues, unless a vacancy opened in the Scottish Football League. The final example of this was ahead of the 2008–09 season, where Gretna&#x27;s demise allowed Annan Athletic to take their place. Overall, the structure of men&#x27;s football in Scotland was among the most fractured and multi-faceted in Europe, being unique in having a plurality of adult male governing bodies (with Seniors, Juniors, Amateurs and Welfarers - see below). It was not uncommon for a given town or county to have clubs in as many as three or four separate systems.

Moves towards creating a pyramid system began in 2008 under the tenure of Scottish Football Association (SFA) chief executive Gordon Smith, with discussions between the SFA and the regional and junior leagues. On 7 May 2013 Scottish Premier League clubs unanimously agreed on the introduction of a pyramid structure to Scottish football along with the reintroduction of a single governing body for the 42 clubs competing at a national level, a revised financial distribution model, and the possibility of a promotion/relegation play-off between the top two divisions.

===Senior football===

The current system has been in place since 2013–14, when the Scottish Professional Football League was formed by a merger of the Scottish Premier League (tier 1) and the Scottish Football League (tiers 2–4). At the same time, the Lowland Football League (tier 5) was founded, and from 2014 to 2021 the leagues below (tier 6) began to be incorporated as each joined the system. For each division, its official name, number of clubs, number of games, and promotion/relegation spots are given:

The leagues below level four are classed as &quot;non-league football&quot;, meaning they are outside the Scottish Professional Football League and are played on a regional not a national basis. The Lowland League was created in 2013–14 and runs in parallel with the Highland League to form level five on the pyramid. Since 2014–15 the two league winners have played off against each other, with the winner then playing the team finishing 10th in League Two in a promotion/relegation play-off for a place in the SPFL. 

Below the Highland League is the Midlands League (20 clubs); North Caledonian Football League (12 teams, including one reserve team); and the North Region League (31 clubs, 2 divisions). Below the Lowland League is the East of Scotland Football League (58 clubs, including one reserve team, 4 divisions); the South of Scotland Football League (12 clubs, including one reserve team); and the West of Scotland Football League (80 clubs, 5 divisions). At end of season, round robin promotion play-offs take place between the winners of feeder leagues of the Highland and Lowland League respectively (subject to each club meeting licensing criteria) for promotion to tier 5.

At the start of the 2024–25 season, this totalled 291 teams across 20 divisions.

==== Cup competitions ====
All clubs in tier 5 and above automatically enter the Scottish Cup, along with clubs in other divisions who are full members of the Scottish Football Association. Up to three non-SFA members can qualify for the Scottish Cup each season by winning the East, South or West leagues, or the East, South and West Cup-Winners Shield. All 42 SPFL clubs compete in the Scottish League Cup, along with the Highland and Lowland champions, and one additional invited team. The Scottish Challenge Cup features 30 SPFL clubs from outside the Premiership, Under 21s teams, and four from the Highland and Lowland leagues.

The SFA South Region Challenge Cup is for all 164 non-league clubs in the Lowland area (excluding reserve or B teams). The SFA North Region Challenge Cup existed between 2007 and 2009. There are also a variety of smaller cup tournaments at league and regional level.

===Junior football===

The Scottish Junior Football Association (SJFA) manages two regions: the SJFA East Region of 19 clubs; and the SJFA North Region of 34 clubs (4 clubs withdrew for 2022–23). This represents a total of 53 teams across 3 divisions. The term &#x27;junior&#x27; refers not to the age of the players but the level of football played. These two regions joined the pyramid system at tier 6 below the Highland League in 2021–22.

Members of the SJFA, consisting of 114 teams in total from the two regions as well as the East of Scotland League and West of Scotland League (5 teams are in abeyance for 2022–23), participate in the Scottish Junior Cup. Up to three non-SFA members can qualify for the Scottish Cup each season by winning the Midlands League, North Superleague, or the Junior Cup. Banks O&#x27; Dee also enter senior tournaments in the Aberdeenshire Cup and Shield, and run an Under-20s team in the Senior development structure (the Aberdeenshire &amp; District League).

In 2020, as part of a long process to form an integrated footballing pyramid structure, all 63 West Region Junior clubs decided to depart and join the newly founded West of Scotland Football League, a feeder to the Lowland League. Between 2017 and 2020 more than half of the East Region clubs departed the junior ranks, joining the senior East of Scotland Football League which is also below the Lowland League. The remaining clubs in the East Premiership South made the same move to the East of Scotland League for season 2021–22, and the East Premiership North clubs formed the Midlands League at tier 6 below the Highland League. The North Region also joined the pyramid structure at the same level. The northern leagues at that level entered the pyramid later in July.

In February 2025, the SJFA acknowledged the request of teams participating in the East and North Regions to become autonomous within the Scottish Football Association structure, which would leave the organisation responsible for the Junior Cup only.

===Amateur football===

Again separate from the above, and generally agreed to lie &#x27;below&#x27; the senior and junior levels, are the hundreds of clubs in membership of the Scottish Amateur Football Association which oversees 50 leagues - although this includes Sunday League football and futsal competitions. Prestige centres around the historic Scottish Amateur Cup. A number of Senior and Junior clubs run reserve teams in Amateur football. Student and Police football is also affiliated to the SAFA.

As of 2022–23 there are 360 teams – in 12 geographic leagues containing a total of 31 league divisions – playing Saturday football under a regular August–May season. In addition there are 137 teams playing in four specialist Saturday Morning leagues (including one for Glasgow Colleges Amateur Football Association) in Dundee and Glasgow, plus 22 teams playing in Strathclyde Evangelical Churches Football League.

There are also 90 teams playing in the Summer Saturday leagues (season 2022), most of which are located in the Highland; 244 teams are in the Sunday League system. &lt;onlyinclude&gt;

==== Saturday Leagues (Winter) ====
==== Saturday Leagues (Summer) ====
==== Sunday Leagues ====

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Welfare football===

Roughly concurrent with the Scottish Amateur Football Association is the Scottish Welfare Football Association, which has a very low profile nationally. The SWFA was established in the aftermath of World War I, and oversees leagues mainly operating Sunday and summer or midweek football, predominantly in the north of Scotland.

From a peak of over 500 clubs, there were 158 teams in membership in November 2012, down from 238 teams in 2007.

As of Season 2022 (Summer) and 2022–23 (Winter) there are 100 teams in 8 geographic leagues, plus 13 clubs playing in Warriors Premier League.

===Reserve and Youth football===
The reserve and youth leagues are mostly governed by the relevant adult leagues. 
== Women&#x27;s system ==

=== Senior football ===
Senior leagues of women&#x27;s football in Scotland are structured as follows: 
=== Youth football ===
==== Cup competitions ====
The Scottish Women&#x27;s Cup is open to all senior teams affiliated with Scottish Women&#x27;s Football. There are also the Scottish Women&#x27;s Football League Cup, Scottish Women&#x27;s Football League Plate, Scottish Women&#x27;s Championship Cup, and Highlands &amp; Islands League Cup.

<doc id="563490" wikidata="Q204083" url="?curid=563490" title="Fort York">
<text>Fort York is an early 19th-century military fortification in the Fort York neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The fort was used to house members of the British and Canadian militaries, and to defend the entrance of the Toronto Harbour. The fort features stone-lined earthwork walls and eight historical buildings within them, including two blockhouses. The fort forms a part of Fort York National Historic Site, a site that includes the fort, Garrison Common, military cemeteries, and a visitor centre.

The fort originated from a garrison established by John Graves Simcoe in 1793. Anglo-American tensions resulted in the fort being further fortified and designated as an official British Army post in 1798. The original fort was destroyed by American forces following the Battle of York in April 1813. Work to rebuild the fort began later in 1813 over the remains of the old fort and was completed in 1815. The rebuilt fort served as a military hospital for the remainder of the War of 1812, although it briefly saw action against an American naval vessel in August 1814.

Fort York remained in use with the British Army and the Canadian militia, despite the opening of New Fort York to the west in the 1840s. In 1870, the property was formally transferred to the Canadian militia. The municipal government assumed ownership of the fort in 1909, although the Canadian military continued to make sporadic use of the fort until the end of the Second World War. 

The fort and the surrounding area were designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923. The fort was restored to its early-19th-century configuration in 1934 and reopened as a museum on the War of 1812 and military life in 19th-century Canada.

==Name==
The name &quot;Fort York&quot; is a retronym, with the fortifications initially called &quot;the Garrison&quot;, &quot;the Garrison at York&quot;, or &quot;the Fort at York&quot;, the latter two taking their name from the settlement the fort protected. After new fortifications were built in 1841, residents of Toronto referred to the older fortifications as the &quot;Old Fort&quot;, in order to distinguish it from the new fort. Usage of the term &quot;Fort York&quot; to refer to the old fort emerged during the 1870s. The site was referred to as &quot;Old Fort York&quot; from the time it was converted into historic museum in the early 20th century to 1970 when the Toronto Historical Society re-branded the site as &quot;Historic Fort York&quot;.

==History==
The British first examined Toronto as a potential settlement and military site during the 1780s, although a permanent military presence was not established in Toronto until 1793; during a period when Anglo-American relations had deteriorated. In the early 1790s, John Graves Simcoe, the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, began to consider building a fort in Toronto; as a part of a larger effort to reposition isolated British garrisons in the U.S. Northwest Territory and near the Canada–United States border to more centralized positions, and to vacate British forces from U.S. territory in an attempt to reduce tensions with the Americans. Simcoe&#x27;s decision to base a fort in Toronto was also influenced by his assessment that American forces could overrun its positions in the frontier, including its naval base in Kingston. 

Simcoe selected Toronto (renamed York from 1793 to 1834) as the location of a new military garrison, due to its proximity away from the border, and because its natural harbour only had one access point from water, making it easy to defend. Once established, Simcoe envisioned the harbour as a base where British control over Lake Ontario could be exerted, and where they could repel a potential American attack from the west into eastern Upper Canada.

He also envisioned the fort serving as the centre of a transportation network where British forces could be dispatched throughout the colony. Simcoe planned for the fort to be connected to a network of subsidiary fortifications along a series of east-west roads acting as an alternate transportation route to the Great Lakes, and the north-south portage route that leads to the Georgian Bay. The latter route was vital for maintaining communication with British outposts in lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, in the event the routes through Lake Erie and the Detroit River become cut off by Americans forces. However, many of the planned subsidiary forts were never built, with Simcoe unable to procure the funds needed to build them.

===Original fort (1793–1813)===
The first permanent British garrison was established in Toronto on 20 July 1793, when 100 soldiers from the Queen&#x27;s Rangers landed around Garrison Creek; and erected 30 cabins built from green wood on the site of the fort for wintering quarters; configured in a triangular shape similar to the present fort&#x27;s shape. Simcoe planned for Fort York to be a part of a defence complex built around the settlement&#x27;s harbour, with the fort situated north of another fortification planned at Gibraltar Point. However, his proposal to further fortify the settlement was rejected by the governor general of the Canadas, Lord Dorchester, who took the position that the money should instead be spent on improving the defences at the naval base in Kingston.

Simcoe pressed forward with the construction of Fort York despite the governor general&#x27;s objections; although he had to rely on funds from the provincial treasury as opposed to military funds, given that the fort was not an official army post. By November 1793, Fort York consisted of two log barracks, a stockade, and a sawmill to provide lumber. Over the next year, the Queen&#x27;s Rangers erected a guard house, and two blockhouses near Gibraltar Point, albeit at a smaller scale than what was envisioned by Simcoe. The fort defended the harbour&#x27;s access point, as well as the most likely landward approach the Americans would take towards the settlement; with British planners believing American forces would land west of the harbour, and advance towards the settlement with the support of its naval vessels. Simcoe continued to develop York&#x27;s fortifications until the end of 1794 when he concluded that York could not be defended in its current state. In 1794, Simcoe took several artillery pieces from these fortifications after he was ordered to erect Fort Miamis in the Northwest Territory, leaving York with only a few condemned guns that were taken from Kingston.

By the time most of the colony&#x27;s administration was relocated to York in 1796, the fort was manned by a 147-man garrison. As York&#x27;s naval shipyards were based at Humber Bay, and no naval base existed in its harbour, the defensive capabilities of Fort York remained limited. However, two other blockhouses were erected around the settlement, including one at Fort York. The blockhouse at Fort York also featured a cupola, used to guide ships into the harbour.

In late 1798, Fort York formally became an official British Army post, granting it access to funds reserved for military use. After the fort was made an official military post, a stockade was built around the fort. Many of its original structures were also replaced with new buildings, including barracks, carriage and engine shed, the colonial government house, guardhouse, gunpowder magazine, and storehouses. As Anglo-American tensions rose again at the beginning of the 19th century, Major-General Isaac Brock ordered the construction of three artillery batteries, and a wall and dry moat on the western boundary of the fort. The batteries were equipped with furnaces, allowing the batteries to fire heated shot, with further 12-pounder guns placed on mobile carriages used to respond to threats outside the fixed ranges of the batteries.

Simcoe&#x27;s original proposal of using York as a naval base was also reconsidered during the early 19th century, with plans to expand the fort near Government House to accommodate a naval base. However, as the majority of the naval assets in Upper Canada were based in Kingston, the governor general of the Canadas, George Prévost, planned to make the move to York in phases.

When news of the American declaration of war arrived at York, the regulars and military cavalry squad of the fort left for the Niagara peninsula, eventually participating in the Battle of Queenston Heights. While its garrison was deployed in the Niagara, Fort York was manned by the Canadian militia. However, it was apparent to the colonial administration that the settlement could not repel an attack without further improvements to its fortifications; something not possible due to wartime shortages.

====Battle of York====

The town of York was eventually attacked by American forces in April 1813. The attack formed the first part of Henry Dearborn&#x27;s plan to take the Canadas by first attacking York, then the Niagara peninsula, Kingston, and finally Montreal. Fort York formed a part of the settlement&#x27;s defences, which included batteries and blockhouses around the town and Gibraltar Point. After reports of approaching American ships reached the settlement, most professional troops in the area, First Nations-allied warriors, and some members of the local militia assembled at the fort. The regulars and militias stationed at the town&#x27;s blockhouse were later ordered to reassemble at Fort York once it was made apparent that no landings would occur east of the settlement.

Most of the fighting occurred during the American landing, approximately west of the fort. Unable to prevent the landings, and repel the force at the western battery, the British-First Nations force eventually retreated back to the fort. American forces advanced east towards the fort and assembled themselves outside its walls, exchanging artillery fire with the fort. The naval squadron also bombarded the fort, having re-positioned themselves directly south of the fort&#x27;s stockade. Recognizing that the battle was lost, the British commanding officer, Roger Hale Sheaffe, ordered for a silent withdrawal from the fort, and to rig the fort&#x27;s gunpowder magazine to explode to prevent its capture. The two sides continued to exchange artillery fire until Sheaffe&#x27;s withdrawal from the fort was complete. Because the British flag was left on the flagpole of the fort, the Americans assembling outside its walls assumed the fort remained occupied. 

As the gunpowder magazine contained 74 tons of iron shells and 300 barrels of gunpowder, a significant amount of debris was launched into the air once the gunpowder magazine was ignited and dropped onto the American forces still outside the fort. The following explosion resulted in over 250 American casualties, including Brigadier General Zebulon Pike. Fearing a counterattack after the explosion, American forces regrouped outside the wall and did not advance onto the abandoned fort until after British forces left York.

The fort was occupied by the American forces after the town&#x27;s surrender. During the brief occupation, members of the militia were detained in the fort for two days before being released on &quot;parole&quot;. The British dead were buried within the fort in shallow graves, although they were later reburied outside the fort after the Americans departed the town. Government House, already damaged by the gunpowder magazine explosion, was razed by American forces on 1 May 1813. Before they departed from York, the American forces razed several more buildings including most of the structures in the fort, except its barracks.

===Rebuilt fort (1813–1932)===

Plans to rebuild the settlement&#x27;s defences, including the fort, and the surrounding blockhouses were undertaken in the second half of 1813 to defend a four-vessel squadron the Royal Navy planned to station at York&#x27;s harbour. Several structures were completed at the fort by November 1813, including the Government House Battery and the Circular Battery, each equipped with two mortars; with another two blockhouses nearing completion. The blockhouses were also designed to act as barracks for the town&#x27;s garrison, in order to allow for the immediate garrisoning of troops in the settlement. In the following years, the forest around the fort was cleared to deprive Americans of cover in the event of another attack; and the defensive earthworks, barracks, and gunpowder magazine were rebuilt. The fort was not completed until around 1815; due to small numbers of artificer available at York, and a warm 1813–14 winter preventing the use of sleighs to transport supplies during that season.

The fort operated as a hospital centre from the latter half of 1813 to the end of the war, with the naval squadron stationed at York assisting in transporting wounded soldiers from the Niagara front to the town. On 6 August 1814, an American naval squadron arrived near York&#x27;s harbour, under the suspicion that British vessels were stationed there. The squadron dispatched the to sail into the harbour under a white flag in a ploy to evaluate the town&#x27;s defences. However, the militia stationed in the fort shot at the vessel, resulting in the two sides exchanging fire before the &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; withdrew back to its squadron outside the harbour. The American squadron did not attempt another attack on the fort, although remained outside York&#x27;s harbour for three days before sailing away.

====Post War of 1812====

Work on the fort came to an immediate halt at the end of the war. By 1816, the rebuilt fort included eighteen buildings capable of holding a garrison of 650 soldiers. An additional 350 soldiers were also capable of being garrisoned in military facilities adjacent to the fort. After the war, the fort continued to be a point of focus for military planners in the region, with York envisioned as an area that could provide cover for a retreat to Kingston and Lower Canada, or as a rallying point for British forces to defend the Niagara peninsula. The British also continued to use the fort to protect the north-south portage route to the upper Great Lakes.

In the decades after the War of 1812, several buildings within the fort were torn down and replaced. However, the fort&#x27;s conditions was largely shaped by British foreign relations; as it suffered from poor maintenance during times of peace, and underwent repairs and reinforcing during perceived signs of hostilities. By the early 1830s, it had become apparent that new fortifications needed to be built to replace the decaying Fort York, with a plan formally approved in 1833. Completed in 1841, New Fort York was situated west of Fort York, and was initially only connected to a settlement via a pathway through Fort York. Although new fortifications were erected, the military continued to use Fort York&#x27;s batteries to help defend the harbour; and the adjacent open space for drills, and as a rifle range. In addition to its military uses, from 1839 to 1840, the old fort also hosted a Royal Society meteorological and magnetic observatory, before it was relocated to its permanent location at the University of King&#x27;s College campus. Plans were in place to also build three martello towers between Fort York and Gibraltar Point, although those plans were abandoned.

At the onset of the Rebellions of 1837–1838, the garrison at Fort York was dispatched to Lower Canada, resulting in the fort only being manned by 10 regulars of the British Army. The fort was eventually reinforced by the Queen&#x27;s Rangers after the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern, with members of the militia descending on the city to defend the colonial government. The fort was left virtually unmanned again in 1854 after the garrison was recalled to participate in the Crimean War. During their two-year absence, the fort was largely maintained by a staff of 150 &quot;enrolled pensioners,&quot; made up of British Army retirees who were granted land around the city following their retirement. 

Deteriorating Anglo-American relations in the 1860s as a result of the Trent Affair prompted the military to look into fortifying the Toronto garrison, using it as a base to repulse, or slow down, a potential invasion of Canada West. The proposal had the shore batteries of the fort dismantled, and replaced with rifled artillery on mobile carriages. The proposal failed to materialize, although continued to be suggested into the 1880s.

In an effort to reduce tensions with the Americans in the lead-up to the signing of the Treaty of Washington, the British began to withdraw its military forces from all its secondary North American garrisons, including Fort York. Fort York was formally handed over to the federal government of Canada on 25 July 1870. The last British imperial troops stationed at Fort York departed in 1871, alongside two Canadian militia regiments as a part of the Wolseley expedition. During the 1870s and 1880s, the provincial and municipal governments inquired about purchasing Fort York, although the offers were rejected by the Department of Militia and Defence; as the old fort served as New Fort York&#x27;s only access point to the rest of the city, as well as its rifle range. The fort was also used as familial quarters for regulars, militia offices, storage space, and as a training ground. During the Second Boer War, and the First World War, the fort was also used as a local enlistment centre.

In 1903, an agreement was reached between the municipal government of Toronto to purchase the old fort, as well as New Fort York. As a part of the deed of transfer from the Department of Militia and Defence, the city agreed to preserve, and &quot;properly care for&quot; the old fort. The agreement also allowed the military to continue to use as much of the property as they needed until newer facilities were built for them. The Canadian militia continued to occupy the fort as a storehouse for ammunition and supplies, and as dwellings for military families until the 1930s when restorations of the fort were underway.

In 1905, a proposal to build a streetcar through Fort York prompted historical, and military organizations to form the &quot;Old Fort Protective Association&quot;. Although the streetcar proposal never came to fruition, appeals from the association, political figures, and the Toronto media led Canadian prime minister Wilfrid Laurier to place new conditions on the fort&#x27;s deed of transfer, requiring the city to restore the old fort to its original condition, or have the adjacent commons revert to federal ownership. The property was formally transferred from the Department of Militia and Defence to the municipal government in 1909.

On 25 May 1923, Fort York was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.

===Repurposing into a museum (1932–present)===

In 1932, the municipal government of Toronto undertook a two-year restoration of Fort York, converting the fort into a historic site and museum. The city began to restore the fort to its 1816 configuration as a make-work program, and to celebrate the centennial of the incorporation of Toronto. As a result of the restoration, the Canadian militia ended its occupancy of the fort, although the military briefly reused parts of Fort York during the Second World War. In order to accommodate the military, Fort York Armoury was built between Fort York and New Fort York in the 1930s. 

Fort York was formally reopened as a museum on Victoria Day in 1934. A historical reenactment unit dressed as infantry soldiers, fifers and drummers was also maintained to support museum operations.

In 1949, management of the fort was transferred from Toronto Parks Division, to the Toronto Civic Historical Committee (predecessor of the Toronto Historical Board). Further restoration work on the site was also carried out that year.

In 1958, the government of Metropolitan Toronto proposed to move Fort York along Toronto&#x27;s contemporary waterfront, whose location was now further south from the fort as a result of land reclamation projects during the late 1800s and early 1900s. The regional government proposed the move in an effort to make way for the Gardiner Expressway, and to &quot;recreate&quot; the fort&#x27;s original setting by the shoreline. However, the proposal was eventually rejected due to public opposition, with the planned expressway rerouted around the fort. The public effort to save the fort served as the impetus for the historic preservation movement in Toronto, as well as the foundations for the Toronto Historical Board.

The fort was included in the City of Toronto&#x27;s inaugural inventory of heritage properties in 1973, with the entire precinct later designated as a provincial &quot;heritage conservation district&quot; in 1985. Several excavations were conducted between 1976 and 2011 to determine the exact location of several demolished buildings, and the initial topography of the fort.

In 1994, the Friends of Fort York and Garrison Common was formed by local residents, with the organization later incorporated as a registered charity to support the national historic site. In the same year, the Toronto Historical Board reconstituted the Fort York Guard historical animation unit that had operated until the mid-1980s. Management of the Guard, which employed high school and university students clad in the uniforms of the Canadian Regiment of Fencible Infantry, was later assumed by the Friends of Fort York. The Guard enlivened the site with musket, artillery, and music demonstrations in the summer months until 2022 when the municipal government suspended the grant used to support it, reportedly in the belief that living history displays perpetuated colonialism.

Following the amalgamation of Toronto in 1997, museum operations fell under the city&#x27;s Museum and Heritage Services. However, in 2000, Toronto City Council transferred management of the fort to a board of citizen appointees, separate from the other municipally-operated museums in Toronto.

In September 2017, Fort York served as the archery venue for the 2017 Invictus Games, a multi-parasports event for wounded, injured or sick armed forces personnel.

==Grounds==

Fort York National Historic Site occupies approximately of land. When the fort was initially established, it was situated along the Toronto waterfront. However, decades of land reclamation projects beginning in 1850 resulted in the fort being situated inland by the 1920s. At one point, the military reserve that the fort was on was , although its size slowly shrank as portions of the reserve were partitioned to build housing and factories. The grounds is the property of the municipal government of Toronto and is one of several National Historic Sites of Canada not owned or maintained by Parks Canada.

The national historic site includes Fort York, the mustering grounds west of the fort known as &quot;Garrison Common&quot;, the visitor centre, and military cemeteries situated to the north of the fort; including cemeteries and green spaces physically separated from the rest of the national historic site by the Railway Lands. The parkland north of the Railway Lands is connected to the rest of the historic site by two pedestrian and cycle bridges known as Garrison Crossing. Completed in 2019, the two bridges are the first bridges in Canada to be made entirely of stainless steel. The cemetery was used for the interment of soldiers and their families from 1793 to 1863. A portion of the cemetery was later renamed Victoria Memorial Square. Several of the original headstones used in the cemetery were later utilized to create a memorial at Victoria Memorial Square.

In 2004, the provincial heritage conversation district was expanded to include Fort York Armoury, located southwest of the visitor centre. However, as opposed to the rest of the historic site, Fort York Armoury remains in use as a drill hall and armoury for the Canadian Army, with the Department of National Defence acting as the custodians for the building. 

The grounds of the national historic site, including Garrison Common, the military cemeteries, and the parkland is accessible to the public year-round. However, access to the fort and the visitor centre is limited by the museum&#x27;s operating hours. 

Exhibits on the War of 1812, and military life in 19th century Canada are displayed in the buildings inside the fort, and the visitor centre. 

===Fort===
The fort complex occupies approximately of land, and includes the bastioned, stone-lined earthwork, and buildings within it. The fort is the only remaining authentic fort that was built in Canada during the War of 1812, with its defensive earthworks, and seven buildings dating to its 1813–15 reconstruction. The buildings within the fort also form the largest collection of buildings in Canada that date back from the War of 1812.

The fort itself contains eight historical buildings, seven of which date back to the fort&#x27;s reconstruction from 1813 to 1815, while the eighth building is a reconstruction of a barracks that previously stood at the fort. Buildings that date back to the fort&#x27;s 1813–15 reconstruction include the two blockhouses, two soldiers barracks, the officers&#x27; &quot;brick barracks&quot; and mess hell, a brick-walled magazine, and a stone-walled magazine. The following buildings are all situated in their original arrangements and uses their original materials, design, and finishes. The stone magazine is a store for ammunition and gunpowder, whose walls are thick, and features a vaulted bomb-proof door. Problems in the magazine&#x27;s foundations shortly after its completion led to the construction of the brick magazine.

In addition to its historical buildings, the fort also contains several small modern facilities used for museum operations. These include a modern kitchen and washrooms built into the northern ramparts of the fort, and a small gunpowder magazine dating to the 1970s.
====Barracks====

Three barracks date back to the fort&#x27;s 1813–15 reconstruction, two enlisted barracks, and one officers&#x27; barracks and mess hall. The living space provided in the officers&#x27; barracks contrasted greatly living spaces provided for enlisted soldiers. The two enlisted barracks at the fort housed a larger number of soldiers and their families, although, by the 1860s, these barracks were largely used as married quarters for only three soldiers and their families.

Restored to its 1830s configuration, the brick officers&#x27; barrack holds two apartments for officers; with each apartment holding four living quarters for officers, and a kitchen/servant&#x27;s room. The mess hall portion of the brick barracks was designed as a general officers&#x27; mess hall and has two access points, one to the outside, and another to the barracks portion of the building. Servant rooms were also provided with a separate entry point from the rest of the barracks. The officers&#x27; brick barracks also contain the city&#x27;s &quot;oldest kitchen,&quot; with a steep staircase in the kitchen pantry leading to the basement kitchen. The oven remains in the kitchen, although its floors have been removed for archeological studies. A ground-level kitchen was added to the building in 1826.

The fourth barracks inside the fort, the blue officer&#x27; barracks and mess hall, is a reconstruction of a junior officer&#x27;s barracks that stood on the site. The single-storey reconstruction is made up of four apartments, each containing four separate quarters connected by a central hall for three officers and a servant&#x27;s room/kitchen. The blue barracks reconstruction was built in 1986.

====Blockhouses====

As with several other British-designed fortifications for the time, the fort&#x27;s two blockhouses featured splinter-proof constructions, loopholes and portholes for small arms and small artillery pieces, and a second storey that overhangs off the first. However, contrasting other blockhouses built by the British during this period, the blockhouses at Fort York included cellar storage and magazine facilities; although lacked windows on the first floor, deemed too dangerous to place in the blockhouses. The levels of the blockhouses were designed so that they may isolate themselves from the other floor of the blockhouse, in the event the other level is penetrated. The foundations of the blockhouses are made of limestone and shale, coursed and laid in lime mortar; whereas the square-timber walls were made of white pine reinforced with trunnels. Clapboards were placed on the exterior wall to improve its impermeability. Both blockhouses featured raised entrances on the second floor facing the east, with the expectation that an attack on the fort would come from the west.

The fort&#x27;s two blockhouses were positioned north of the fort&#x27;s shore batteries, defending the rear approaches of the batteries, while the rest of the fort&#x27;s defences were being built. After the fort was completed, the blockhouses reverted to a secondary role, serving as the fort&#x27;s citadel. The blockhouses were also designed to act as barracks, with the blockhouse situated in the southeast (Blockhouse No. 1) able to accommodate 120 soldiers, whereas the blockhouse situated near the circular battery (Blockhouse No. 2) is capable of housing 160 soldiers. For a brief period, shortly after the 1837–38 rebellions, both blockhouses were equipped with a dry moat and draw bridge, although these entrenchments were later filled in. The interior of the blockhouses were modified on several occasions to match the contemporary needs of the military, and later the museum.

====Ramparts====

The fort&#x27;s buildings are surrounded by bastioned, stone-lined earthwork designed to absorb incoming cannon fire; with room for palisades to be placed on the earthen walls to prevent land assaults. Although land reclamation projects in the 18th and 19th centuries made the fort no longer situated along the Toronto waterfront, the original shoreline embankment is still visible outside the southern ramparts of the fort.

The location of the ramparts has also been modified throughout the decades, with the ramparts having been refortified/rebuilt in 1838, the 1860s, and the 1930s. In 1916, the northeastern portion of the ramparts was demolished to make way for the Bathurst streetcar route. The northeastern portion of the ramparts was rebuilt in the 1930s when the municipal government was restoring the rest of the fort. However, due to the growth of the Railway Lands in the previous decade, the northern portion of the ramparts was rebuilt further south from its original location; with the wall&#x27;s reconstruction also necessitating the demolition of a barracks. During the same period, the fort&#x27;s southern ramparts were also raised from its earlier configuration and moved approximately north.

The fort and its ramparts have nine gun placements, although the fort&#x27;s design had intended for more gun placement in other strategic areas inside the fort during wartime. The central &quot;circular battery&quot; on the fort&#x27;s southern ramparts was expanded in 1828 to accommodate more guns. Palisades were erected along the earthen wall during the 1860s, in addition to the construction of parapets, and an additional seven-gun battery along the southern ramparts.

====Demolished structures====

Several other buildings were also erected within the fort that were later demolished. There remains little trace of the fort&#x27;s original topography, or its original structures, most of which are buried underground. The remains of the original fort built in 1793 are situated under the present fort, with the remains of the first Government House buried under the fort&#x27;s parade grounds. Debris and ruins from the battle in April 1813 were also later buried and deposited in the crater created by the detonation of the gunpowder magazine. The location of the gunpowder magazine that was ignited during the battle is marked by a maple tree, and contains a plaque commemorating the Rush-Bagot Treaty, a treaty signed shortly after the War of 1812 that led to the demilitarization of the Great Lakes.

Several buildings were erected during the fort&#x27;s 1813–15 reconstruction, with the fort holding 18 buildings in 1816. However, a number of these buildings were later demolished, including the carpenter&#x27;s shop, the sappers&#x27; and miners&#x27; barracks, the soldiers&#x27; barracks, and a cook house along the southern ramparts. Work on a third blockhouse along the fort&#x27;s western wall was also underway in 1815, but was destroyed by a fire and was not rebuilt. The carpenter building appeared to have been demolished after 1815, the barracks were demolished in 1822, and the cookhouse was torn down in 1848.

The Commandant&#x27;s House, &quot;D&quot; Barrack, the artillery barracks and the 1838 cookhouse were also structures within Fort York that were later demolished. However, the area where these cluster of buildings were situated is located north of the present fort; as the fort&#x27;s northern ramparts were rebuilt further south from its original location during the 1930s restoration.

===Visitor centre===

The visitor centre is a rectangular building that lies north of the Gardiner Expressway, and south of Garrison Common. The contract to design the building was awarded to Patkau Architects, in collaboration with Kearns Mancini Architects in December 2009. The building was opened to the public in 2014, although was not completed until 2015. The building is built along the original escarpment of Lake Ontario&#x27;s shoreline, with the building also acting as a retaining wall for the escarpment and Garrison Common directly north of the centre. The roof of the building features a green roof; which also contains the exit to the centre, depositing its visitors to the Garrison Common.

The exterior southern facade of the building is made of monolithic weathering steel panels, reflecting where the historical escarpment and shoreline of the lake would be in the early 19th century. Light permeates into the building through glazed slits between the steel panels for parts of the facade that are covered by the steel panels. Certain parts of the southern facade feature a glass wall, with the steel panels placed in an &quot;awning-like&quot; position allowing visitors outside to glimpse into the museum. All the steel panels are bolted into place, although they can be dismantled when highway maintenance crews require the space.

The interior of the building is designed to circulate visitors through a ramp, from the centre&#x27;s entrance at the base of the structure, towards an ascending access ramp that leads towards Garrison Common. The visitor centre holds several exhibits including a exhibit of artifacts from the War of 1812, a vault to display light-sensitive artifacts, and an &quot;immersive exhibit&quot; of the Battle of York. In addition to exhibition galleries, the visitor centre also holds administrative offices, and a community meeting centre.

==Surrounding defences==

In addition to Fort York, the British erected several other fortifications and artillery batteries to defend the community. However, except Fort York and New Fort York&#x27;s officers&#x27; quarters, all of these structures were demolished by the mid-20th century. Before the Battle of York in 1813, the settlement was defended by Fort York and three other blockhouses, two blockhouses at Gibraltar Point, and one in the town around King and Parliament Street. In addition to these blockhouses, the town was also defended by two artillery batteries west of the fort, the Western Battery, and the Half-Moon Battery. Most of the original fort, in addition to the three blockhouses around the settlement were destroyed by American forces following the Battle of York.

After the Battle of York, the fort was rebuilt, and three blockhouses were erected around the settlement; one at Gibraltar Point, another built next to the Western Battery, and the third blockhouse was built around Queen Street, defending the inland western approach into the town. The blockhouse on Queen Street was dismantled in 1818, whereas the other two were left &quot;in ruins&quot; by the mid-1820s. Following the rebellions in 1837–38, three more blockhouses were erected in the periphery of Toronto; one around College Street and Spadina Avenue, another blockhouse on Sherbourne Street, and a third along Yonge Street. In 1841, New Fort York was completed along the shoreline west of Fort York. The three blockhouses were dismantled and removed by the mid-19th century. Conversely, New Fort York remained in use by the military until the end of the Second World War. The majority of the New Fort York was demolished in 1951, although the new fort&#x27;s officers&#x27; quarters still stand.

<doc id="563500" wikidata="Q2553468" url="?curid=563500" title="VTech Laser 200">
<text>The [[VTech]] Laser 200 is an 8-bit home computer from 1983, also sold as the [[Salora Oy|Salora]] Fellow (mainly in Fennoscandia, particularly Finland), the Seltron 200 in Hungary &amp; Italy, the Smart-Alec Jr. by Dynasty Computer Corporation in Dallas, Texas for the USA, the [[Texet]] TX8000A ( United Kingdom), the [[Dick Smith (retailer)|Dick Smith]] VZ 200 (in Australia &amp; New Zealand), and the VTech VZ 200 (in the United States &amp; Canada).

Video Technology manufactured calculators and LCD pad game toys (similar to Nintendo Game &amp; Watch) at a rather claustrophobic multi-storey factory in Hong Kong. The Laser 110 was a development of an earlier monochrome TRS-80 copy, and further development introduced the Laser 200/210 which were similar to the EACA Colour Genie and the Mattel Aquarius. 

The machine ran basic games on cassette such as &quot;Hoppy&quot; (a version of &quot;Frogger&quot;), &quot;Cosmic Rescue&quot; (&quot;Scramble&quot;), &quot;VZ Invaders&quot; (&quot;Space Invaders&quot;), &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot; (&quot;Chopper&quot;) and &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;. The Laser 200/210 and VZ200 computers were discontinued in 1985 being replaced by the Laser 310 and VZ300 computers.

== Release ==
Released in 1983, the VZ200 gained some following in northern America and Europe. However, in the US the Timex TS1000 undercut the VZ200 selling for $30. It gained a measurable following in countries, where it was supported by the distributor, where Sinclair Research was too disorganised to have any impact.

Due to Dick Smith Electronics&#x27; extensive advertising throughout Australia and New Zealand, the computer gained large popularity. The &quot;Dick Smith&quot;-badged VZ 200 was successful in Australia, where it proved popular as a first computer. By 1984, a Dick Smith Electronics catalogue announced that over 30,000 units had sold within the first 12 months. In Australia, it was bought mostly to learn programming; the only other widely available system in the same price bracket being the Commodore 64. The VZ200 version of BASIC had more features compared to the Commodore 64 BASIC.

The VZ200 had little impact in the UK where it sold at a similar price to the 16 kB ZX Spectrum. At its UK launch, Texet claimed that the £98 () TX8000-branded version was the cheapest colour home microcomputer on the market. However, this was not enough to ensure its success against the dominant ZX Spectrum and similar machines already on sale.

An improved version known as the VTech Laser 310, or the Dick Smith VZ 300 featured a full travel keyboard and 8K ROM software based Floppy Disk Controller, was released in 1985 and continued until 1989.

Laser310&#x27;s were a huge success throughout China. Various Primary schools throughout the country had the Laser310 sitting alongside Apple ][e&#x27;s during the late 1980&#x27;s.

== Technical specification Laser200/Laser210/VZ200==
The VZ200 has three circuit boards, the video board and voltage regulator being separate to the main board.

Externally, the VZ200 resembles a cross between the VIC-20 and the ZX Spectrum. The VZ200 has the one touch command keys of the Spectrum, but unlike the Sinclair machines, their use was not mandatory.

Internally, the VZ200 is a workalike of the Tandy TRS-80 Model I. The micro uses the same basic architecture, but TRS-80 programs cannot be loaded and only simple TRS-80 BASIC programs can be entered as it has a different memory map and some commands in BASIC are absent and can only be substituted by significant alterations in program algorithms, so it cannot be considered a true clone.

The connections consist of a port for an unregulated DC power supply (the voltage regulator is on the PCB), a stereophonic earphone jack for a cassette recorder, an RF modulated video output, an edge connector which is a printer and disk drive port, an edge connector that is a joystick port, and a composite monitor output (NTSC 60 Hz output in North America, PAL 50 Hz output in the British Commonwealth and continental Europe).

The VZ200 uses a copy of a Zilog Z80 processor (made under licence by NEC) running at 3.58 Mhz (3.54 MHz on VZ300) and was initially sold with either 4 Kb (Europe) or 6 Kb (in North America), which was increased to 8 KB within weeks of its release. Throughout Australia and New Zealand, the VZ200 was initially released as an 8 Kb unit. A 16 kB expansion unit was available, increasing RAM to 24 kB. The VZ300 was released with 18 kB of RAM. 

An 8 kB system consists of 6 kB of RAM, 2 kB of video RAM, and 16 kB of ROM. The memory could be expanded to 24 kB (22 kB memory plus 2 kB video memory). Like the TRS-80, both memory and I/O locations are mapped.


Extended RAM was available above top RAM using the remote offset addressing method available on the Z80 (also known as bank switching).

Banks of system memory can be reassigned using an offset above the top RAM. Those banks are then no longer available, so program algorithms cannot be used in extended memory (as the program would &quot;disappear&quot; when extended memory is accessed), so it can only be used for program data.

Video RAM can be increased to access the higher modes of the 6847 since there are video RAM chip select lines on the memory expansion. Remote offset addressing must be used because the video processor cannot address system or internal expansion RAM, externally connected RAM must be used.

=== Video ===

The VZ200 uses the Motorola 6847 video processor ( like the TRS-80 Color Computer ), which has a resolution of 256 × 192 pixels made from either 8 × 8 pixel character blocks in a 32 × 24 block screen, or a monochrome bitmapped mode.

As the VZ200 is limited to only 2 kB of video memory since only 4 kB of memory in total was initially available, the screen is limited to only 16 lines down, making the total number of pixels in text mode 256 × 128 pixels. The bitmapped mode is unavailable.

The VZ200 has up to ten colours, an eight colour palette plus black and buff. The VZ200 has 256 predefined character blocks. Text is only available in upper case. The character blocks cannot be redefined. The screen can use green mode or black mode, the latter using inverse colours.

==== MODE 0 ====
In mode 0, the background colour can be either dark green or orange. Dark green (COLOR,0) consists of nine individual colours, whilst with the orange background (COLOR,1) ten colours are available.

In mode 0, text uses a black foreground with either background colour. The first 128 character blocks are 64 alpha-numeric characters and their inverses. Text mode 0 is the only mode in which black is available.

The latter 128 character blocks consist of a 2×2 pixel block in each possible combination (8), in every of the 8 colour palette for foreground, together with either background colour chosen. Black is not available.

==== MODE 1 ====
For mode 1, two colour sets are used with each background colour:
:SET 1 → background: light green - foreground: light green, yellow, blue or red.
:SET 2 → background: buff [white] - foreground: buff, cyan, magenta or orange.

Text is identical to Mode 0, using either colour set for foreground with each background colour. The difference is that all 2 kB of video memory is used, whereas only 512 bytes of video memory is used for Mode 0, and the text cannot be black, which is unavailable in this mode.

The graphics mode has 128×64 addressable points. For each character block, the background colour can be either light green or buff (white), with the foreground any of the four colours in the set. The colours can be used in any combination on the screen, but only one colour set can be used per screen, so screens are limited to four colours at most.

By using intricate video timing in assembly it is possible to split the display to show all eight colours on the screen, as shown in the VZ200 Five Finger Punch demo &#x27;2018AD&#x27; and Bushy555&#x27;s demo &#x27;8 colours&#x27;. Both of these demos technically should not be possible.

=== Sound output ===
An internal latch is used for cassette output, to drive the piezoelectric loudspeaker attached to the casing, and to control two signals for the 6847 video processor. The loudspeaker is driven using a push-pull method, alternating the outputs on bits 0 and 5 of the latch at $6800.

A 2.5 octave range is available in BASIC through the SOUND command.

Most of the ~70 known 1-bit music players that are written for the ZX Spectrum will also work on the VZ/Laser computer. These have since been ported to the VZ. Since the latch has two bits driving the internal piezo speaker, there is the ability of a software driven volume control - half-volume and full-volume.

=== Peripherals ===
Within a year of the Laser 310&#x27;s release, an 80k disk drive unit was released on to the market, of which two could be connected to the computer at the same time. A plug-pack cartridge containing the DOS ROM was required to operate the drives. The DOS ROM and diskette drives were backwards compatible with the Laser 200.

A number of other VTech designed plug-in peripherals were also available for both the Laser 200 and Laser 310 computers. Among them were joysticks, cassette drive, light pen, printer plotter, 75 baud MODEM, word processor cartridge, and the 16k and 64k extended RAM cartridges. As numbers of users grew, so did the number of home-made kits which were on offer, which included a Speech synthesizer, Music Synthesiser that used the Texas Instruments SN76489AN chip, a real world relay interface, EEPROM programmer, data logger, 300 baud MODEM, full 101 keyboard, 128 Kb sideways RAM extension and a RTTY Ham radio kit.

In 2020 Ben Grimmett from BennVenn Electronics designed and built 50 SD card readers for enthusiasts, which gives the computer a total of 128 Kb of banked RAM, and, depending on memory card, typically a minimum of 2 gigabytes of storage space. A VZ FAT32 DOS was also written for this project and is embedded in EEPROM.

== Other Models==
===Laser 310 / VZ-300===

The Laser 310 was released in 1985 throughout parts of Europe as well as for Mainland China. It was named and sold as the &quot;Dick Smith&quot; VZ 300 throughout Australia and New Zealand. Also based on a Zilog Z80A CPU with a slightly updated 16k ROM version, it was driven by a television colour burst (3.54 MHz) crystal. It came with 16k of RAM for programming, along with the same 2k of Video Ram as that of the Laser 200. 

The VZ300 had a small number of physical upgrades, but is completely compatible with the VZ200. There were three models of keyboard released for the VZ300 - being : 

1) Generation 1 : Brown keys with no under-key labels. (1985)

2) Generation 2 : Brown keys with under-key labels. (1986)

3) Generation 3 : Light-grey/cream coloured keys, with under-key labels. (1987)
Externally, the rubber keys were replaced with hard plastic capped keys. The case was made with a less brittle type of plastic.

Video Technology used higher capacity memory ICs for the VZ-300, having 18 kb of memory (16 kb CPU RAM + 2 kb video RAM). The system RAM capacity was increased to 16 kB, which together with 16 kB of expansion RAM, makes a total of 34 kB RAM for the system.

The VZ200 16 kb RAM expansion could be used, but because of the way the chip select pins were arranged, only 8 kB would actually be available.

ETI magazine in Australia published an electronic circuit which would enable VZ300 owners to use all 16 kB of the VZ200 expansion.

Rare 64k VZ300 unit - There is at least one VZ300 known to exist with 66k of memory (64K RAM + 2K Video), built on the motherboard, built by Video Technology. This unit uses 8x HM4864P-2 8K static RAM chips instead of the usual 8x 2K memory chips.

=== Laser 100 / Laser 110 ===

The Laser 100 and 110 were released just prior to the Laser 210 / VZ200. 
These computers were very similar to TRS-80 Model 1, from the BASIC ROM&#x27;s point of view. 

For video part, instead, it uses a MC6847 (as the TRS-80 Color Computer, which is MC6809-based, not Z80-based like the Laser).

Both computers were released with the same orange coloured keyboard &#x27;chicklet&#x27; style keyboard on a black background.

Both computers also had the same BASIC in ROM, of which, there are at least three versions: 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.

The Laser 100 was released with 2K RAM + 2K Video RAM, whilst the Laser 110 was released with 4K RAM + 2K Video RAM.

Both computers supported colour within the internal language interpreters (BASIC, Assembler), however, the output video from the NTSC and PAL circuitry only supplied black and white signals.

The Laser 100 and 110 computers were never released as a re-badged &#x27;VZ-100&#x27;.

=== Laser 305 ===

The Laser 305 is an extremely rare computer produced by Video Technology. Essentially it is the Laser 310 motherboard placed inside the Laser 200 keyboard, of which, anyone with these two computers could perform themselves. However, the original release and the reasoning behind VTech releasing this particular configuration, unfortunately, has been lost to history. As of July 2021 there are only two known Laser 305&#x27;s in existence.

=== Seltron 200 ===


The Seltron 200 Color Computer is quite unique. Named after the supermarket retail chain &#x27;Scale ELEKTRON&#x27; imported 80 units into Austria and was sold throughout the countries of Austria, Hungary and Italy. The known examples of the Seltron are unique with its own configuration layout of the motherboard; quite different from that of the other family of computers. 

The Seltron&#x27;s motherboard contained the same custom VZ300/Laser310 single packaged GA003 and GA004 chipsets (which replaced discrete VZ200/Laser200-210 components), though the design eliminated the need for the GA008 (clock register and DRAM controller) that is used in the 16 Kb VZ300/Laser310. Some speculate that it was Video Technology&#x27;s attempt at cost reducing the manufacturing process. It was released with the usual 2 Kb of video RAM, along with 2 Kb of user RAM (Same as the Laser 200), however, the motherboard allowed for further expansion of another 2 KB or 4 Kb of RAM. By adding an additional 2x 2 KB user RAM it would bring the Seltron up to the same spec as an &quot;8K&quot; VZ200/Laser210. The Seltron also had the standard 16k ROM, and the motherboard allowed for the option of either a single 16 Kb ROM package or 2x 8 Kb ROM chip packages.

As of 2022 there are around 10 Seltron 200 computers known to be existing, mostly throughout in Hungary.

=== Salorian Fellow ===

Sold as the Salora Fellow throughout Finland, Sweden &amp; Scandinavia. These were supplied with 2k RAM + 2K Video RAM Laser200 computers.

=== Smart Alec Jr ===
Re-labelled and sold/distributed on a small scale throughout the USA.
=== Texet TX8000A ===
Throughout the United Kingdom, the Laser200 was named the Texet TX8000A. Very few models were ever sold, and it is unknown if any exist today.
==Distribution ==

===Australia and New Zealand===
The VZ200 was distributed throughout these countries by Dick Smith Electronics. Tens of thousands were sold.

===United States of America===
In 1985, the first branch of Video Technology was opened in the United States at 390 Convention Way, Redwood City, California. This location served as the main office, mail order center, kit assembly area and retail store. Additional stores were opened in Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California; Stevens Creek Boulevard, San Jose, California; and in Los Angeles. Within a few years the US operation was sold.

There has also been numerous reports over the years of owners having the NTSC model Laser 310 that has been reportedly having been sold and distributed throughout the US. 

The Smart Alec Jr was one of the models sold throughout.

===Canada===
The VZ200 was distributed throughout Canada by Rocelco Inc. 24 Viceroy Road, Unit 1, Concord, Ontario L4K 2L9.
The company is still in existence at the same address and are now a wholesaler of office furniture.

===Germany===
The VTech Laser 200, 210 and VTech Laser 310 sold and distributed all throughout the country by Sanyo.

The VZ200 was sold in Germany as the &quot;VTECH VZ200&quot;, the &quot;more sophisticated Models&quot; as &quot;SANYO VIDEO/LASER XXX&quot;. This led to legal action because of the misleading use of the &quot;SANYO&quot; Brand Name (&quot;SANYO VIDEO&quot;). A friendly agreement was reached with &quot;SANYO&quot; at the time by Video Technology in Hong Kong. Packaging of German LASER 310&#x27;s were labelled &quot;SANYO VIDEO&quot;.

During the early years of the VZ200 and Laser210 throughout Germany saw a large number of the computers being sold, and as such, many user groups formed. It was interesting to note that the Light Pen was sold in Germany in the early years, and as such, quite a number were privately imported into Australia by Gavin Williamson and Bob Kitch and then on sold. The Light pen was never sold in Australia. The Floppy disk drive was marketed and sold throughout Germany (1984) nearly two years before they were even advertised in Australia (end of 1985). Once again, a number of drive units ended up in Australia long before Dick Smith got onboard. One up for Germany.

== Software ==
With both of their releases in Germany, England, USA, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and a few other countries, commercially based software titles grew and were distributed throughout various outlets in their home county syets store fronts throughout Australia and New Zealand sold many titles, including educational and graphical games, finance programs and various software utility tools, most of which have been found and transferred for the use in the various emulators. Unfortunately, there are a number of known software packages that have simply been lost through the passage of time.

Dick Smith Electronics ran a program buying software from local programmers and selling them through their stores for $12 a cassette. Most VZ200 programs were written in Australia, it is the equivalent of the Sinclair ZX-81 in Australia (which was never really available because of production problems in the UK), a system which many early programmers learnt on. The lack of foreign competition tended to encourage local programmers, programmers having little success competing with foreign programs on the most popular system, the Commodore 64.

=== BASIC ===
The VZ includes a built-in BASIC interpreter in ROM, which is used not just for programming, but for accessing the OS, recording programs, and all other operations on the micro.

The VZ200 uses a version of Microsoft BASIC II, similar but not identical to Level II BASIC on the TRS-80, including useful commands like SET, PRINT@ and IF-THEN-ELSE. Firmware machine code routines are available using the RSX command. The firmware contains a large number of useful routines provided by Zilog, via NEC.

Some TRS-80 BASIC commands, such as RANDOMIZE, ON and the really useful DEF commands (only subroutines can be used for formulae), are not available, so only simple TRS-80 programs can be entered without alteration. A number of Extended Basics were written that &quot;unhid&quot; approximately 25 of these hidden BASIC commands that were partially disabled from factory by Video Technology.

The BASIC can use integers, decimals and floating point numbers. Double precision numbers are not available, but can be used by storing the different power position numbers in a string and concatenating the strings.

<doc id="563502" wikidata="Q1316302" url="?curid=563502" title="Catholic Church in Portugal">
<text>The Portuguese Catholic Church, or Catholic Church in Portugal, is part of the worldwide Catholic Church in communion with the Pope in Rome, under the Portuguese Episcopal Conference. The Catholic Church is the world&#x27;s largest Christian organisation. It is Portugal&#x27;s largest religion and its former state religion, and has existed in the territory since the Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Roman Empire.

There are an estimated nine million baptised Catholics in Portugal (84% of the population) in twenty dioceses, served by 2789 priests. Although a large number wish to be baptized, married in the church, and receive last rites, only 19% of the national population attend Mass and take the sacraments regularly.

In 2010, the average age of priests was 62. In 2012 88% of the Portuguese population considered themselves Catholic in a commissioned survey of religious attitudes sponsored by a Christian organization.

==History==
Western Christianity was introduced to the province of Lusitania, what is now Portugal under the Roman Empire in the first half of the first millennium AD. The present-day Portuguese state was founded in 1139 by King Afonso Henriques during the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, in which the Christian kingdoms of the northern Iberian Peninsula reconquered the South from the Cordoba Caliphate of the Sunni Muslim Moors. Crusaders from other Catholic realms aided the reconquest, which Portugal finished in 1249 with the conquest of Algarve.

After the Fall of Constantinople to the Sunni Caliphate of Ottoman Turks, Portuguese discoveries in the Age of Exploration, would lead to the establishment of the Portuguese Empire from the early 15th century onwards, spreading Catholicism to Portuguese colonies in Ceuta on the Barbary coast of North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, the East Indies in Asia, and South America. The Lusophone countries of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Timor-Leste all have Catholic majorities as a result. The Primate of the East Indies based in the Portuguese Goa of early-modern India was part of the Portuguese Empire in the East, and a significant Latin Christian minority remains in the Indian subcontinent, the most prominent of which are Goan Catholics. Bombay East Indian Christians, Mangalorean Christians and Latin Christians of Malabar are also among the lesser-known New Christian converts in the Eastern hemisphere.

The church supported the Miguelist faction during the Liberal Wars of 1828-1834.

In 1910, the Portuguese Republic abolished the policy of having the Latin Church as the state religion, in favour of secularism. However, the right-wing Salazar regime from 1932 to 1974 re-established Catholicism as the state religion, which had repercussions such as the Annexation of Goa and Damaon, after which the system was subsequently disestablished along with the regime.

===Sexual abuse===
In 2021 the Portuguese Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference established an independent committee for the investigation of any sexual abuse of minors within the Portuguese church, the Independent Commission for the Study of Sexual Abuse of Children in the Catholic Church in Portugal began its work in January 2022 and issued its final report in February 2023. The commission was led by child psychologist Pedro Strecht who headed a &#x27;multidisciplinary and gender-balanced&#x27; investigative panel which sought participation from members of the public who had experienced abuse in institutions run by the Church, such as parishes, schools, orphanages or hospitals, or who had otherwise been abused at the hands of a minister or employee of the Church. The commission received 564 testimonies, of which it held 512 to be verified, relating to incidents of abuse which occurred between 1950 and the commission&#x27;s establishment in 2021. From these testimonies the Commission identified that around 77% of alleged perpetrators were priests with 57% of victims as males, most of whom aged between 10 and 14. Commission president Strecht extrapolated that the figure of victims likely stood at around 5000 individuals, and further proposed that as many 100 priests in active ministry as of February 2023 had been credibly accused of abuse. He stated that the commission would submit the names of these priests to the Church and public prosecutor in due course. Following the report&#x27;s publication, 25 serving priests have been reported to the office of public prosecutions.

The president of the Portuguese Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference, Josè Ornelas, responded to the report&#x27;s publication with words of apology and confirmed the Portuguese bishops&#x27; intention to implement the report&#x27;s recommendations.

==Organization==
Within Portugal, the hierarchy consists of archbishops and bishops. At the top of the hierarchy is the archbishop who is known as the Patriarch of Lisbon. The remainder of the dioceses of Portugal, each headed by a bishop, includes:

*Lisbon (with the dignity of Patriarchate)
**Angra
**Funchal
**Guarda
**Leiria-Fátima
**Portalegre-Castelo Branco
**Santarém
**Setúbal
*Braga
**Aveiro
**Bragança-Miranda
**Coimbra
**Lamego
**Porto
**Viana do Castelo
**Vila Real
**Viseu
*Évora
**Beja
**Faro

==Sites==

Portugal is the location of one of the major Catholic shrines and Marian pilgrimage sites, at Fátima, honouring Our Lady of Fátima.

The northern city of Braga is an important Catholic centre. A Portuguese saying which lists characteristics of different cities states that &quot;Coimbra studies, Braga prays, Lisbon shows off and Porto works&quot;. Besides the Cathedral of Braga, it also has the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte and the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Sameiro.

One of the routes on the Way of St. James, a major Catholic pilgrimage to the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral in Galicia, Spain, is the Portuguese route (), starting from Lisbon Cathedral and spanning 610 km. Among those who have taken it was Queen Elizabeth of Portugal, who was canonized, in the 14th century.

==Portuguese Popes==
Two popes were born in what is now Portugal, though only the second one was ever a subject of a country by that name. Damasus I was born in what is now Portugal in 306. His reign as pope from 366 to 384 saw the Scriptures translated to Latin. He is honoured as a saint, with his feast celebrated on December 11.

Pedro Julião, born in Lisbon around 1215, led the church as Pope John XXI from 1276 to 1277.

<text>The J. B. Speed School of Engineering (Speed School or Speed) is the engineering college of the University of Louisville, a public research university in Louisville, KY.

==History==
The college was founded in 1925 by the children of James Breckenridge (J.B.) Speed using a grant from the James Breckenridge Speed Foundation. William S. Speed and Olive Speed Sackett used the grant to established an endowment to honor J. B. Speed. The school began with four departments in Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering.

In 1936, Speed School Bachelor of Science programs became a part of the inaugural accreditation class of the Engineers&#x27; Council for Professional Development (ECPD).

Over time, the college created additional engineering departments to meet industry standards. In the early 1970&#x27;s, the Department Computer Science and Engineering was created. The Department of Industrial Engineering was started in 1977. The Bioengineering Department was established in 2004. Most recently in 2007, the Department of Engineering Fundamentals was established.

Until 2003, it was known as the J. B. Speed Scientific School.

The school is colloquially referred to as Speed School or just Speed by students and locals.

==Degree programs==
The school offers Bachelor of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in seven fields:
*Chemical Engineering (ChE)
*Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)
*Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)
*Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)
*Engineering Management (EM)
*Industrial Engineering (IE)
*Mechanical Engineering (ME)
*Biomedical Engineering (BE)
The school offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in one field:
*Computer Science (CS)

==Student life==
In Fall 2018, the student body consists of 2,546 students (2,038 undergraduate and 508 graduate). The largest departments are ME and CECS, with a little more than 485 and 380 students respectively. In student and faculty opinion, the Speed School is considered to be one of the most rigorous and prestigious programs at the university.

When undergraduate students enter the school, they enter into a 5-year combined Bachelors and Masters program. Most students go to school year-round, in Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters, for a total of 14 semesters. Three of the 14 semesters are for co-op internships, to be done at industry locations, three of the 14 semesters are for the graduate (Masters) program, and the other eight semesters are for the undergraduate (Bachelors) program.

==Accreditation==
Seven programs in the J. B. Speed School of Engineering at the University of Louisville are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET. These programs result in the award of Master of Engineering degrees in the following disciplines:
*Chemical Engineering (ChE)
*Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)
*Computer Engineering and Computer Science (CECS)
*Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)
*Industrial Engineering (IE)
*Biomedical Engineering (BE)
*Mechanical Engineering (ME)

In addition, the J. B. Speed School of Engineering also offers a B. S. degree in Computer Science that is accredited by the Computer Accreditation Commission (CAC) of ABET.

As of November 2010, all bachelor&#x27;s degree-level engineering majors are also accredited by ABET.

==Facilities==
The campus lies almost entirely south of Eastern Parkway on the Belknap Campus (main campus) of the University of Louisville and consists of the following buildings:
* Engineering Graphics building — for the Engineering Graphics department- Demolished in 2013 since the integration of the Engineering Graphics department and the Engineering Fundamentals Department led to the only graphics class offered to be taught in the Duthie Center for Engineering.
* Henry Vogt building — attached to Sackett Hall, used by several departments
*Sackett Hall — attached to the Henry Vogt building, used by the Mechanical Engineering department
* J. B. Speed building — houses the Dean&#x27;s office, Academic Affairs, Admissions, Departments of Engineering Fundamentals, advising offices, and Industrial Engineering departments

<doc id="563513" wikidata="Q4871984" url="?curid=563513" title="Battle of Paoli">
<text>The Battle of Paoli, also known as the Battle of Paoli Tavern or the Paoli Massacre, was a battle in the Philadelphia campaign of the American Revolutionary War fought on September 20, 1777, in the area surrounding present-day Malvern, Pennsylvania. Following the Continental Army&#x27;s retreat in the Battle of Brandywine and the aborted Battle of the Clouds, George Washington left a force behind under the command of Brigadier General Anthony Wayne to monitor and resist the British as they prepared to attack and occupy the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia. 

On the evening of September 20, British forces under Major General Charles Grey led a surprise attack on Wayne&#x27;s encampment near the Paoli Tavern in present-day Malvern, resulting in many American casualties. With inaccurate later claims that the British took no prisoners and granted no quarter, the engagement came to be known as the &quot;Paoli Massacre.&quot;

==Background==

After the American defeat at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, General Washington was intent on accomplishing two tasks. He wanted to protect the revolutionary capitol of Philadelphia from British forces under the command of Lieutenant General Sir William Howe and also shield his inland supply depots at Reading, which was northwest of Philadelphia, and at Lancaster, which was west of Philadelphia. Washington withdrew across the Schuylkill River on September 12, bypassing Philadelphia and heading northwest to the Falls of Schuylkill in the present-day East Falls section of Philadelphia. 

After resting for a full day and refitting, Washington&#x27;s army again crossed the Schuylkill River at Levering&#x27;s Ford in present-day Manayunk on September 14 to face the British, who had moved little since Brandywine due to a shortage of wagons to carry their wounded and baggage. After the Battle of the Clouds, an ultimately aborted engagement due to bad weather on September 16, Washington withdrew to Yellow Springs and Reading Furnace in northern Chester County to replenish his ammunition. He left Brigadier General Anthony Wayne&#x27;s Pennsylvania Division at Yellow Springs in present-day Chester Springs. When the British columns moved towards the Schuylkill River, Wayne followed Washington&#x27;s orders to harass the British and attempt to capture all or part of their baggage train.

Wayne assumed that his presence was undetected and camped close to the British lines from Paoli Tavern in Paoli. Wayne&#x27;s division consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 11th Pennsylvania Regiments, Hartley&#x27;s additional Continental Regiment, an attached artillery company and a small force of dragoons. The various regiments and units amounted to approximately 1,500 men. Several miles to the west and moving to join Wayne was William Smallwood&#x27;s Maryland militia, who had approximately 2,100 inexperienced troops under his command.

The British heard rumors that Wayne was in the area, and Howe dispatched scouts, who reported his location to be near the Paoli Tavern and Warren Tavern in present-day Malvern on September 19. Since his position was just from the British camp in Tredyffrin Township, Howe immediately planned an attack on Wayne&#x27;s camp.

==Battle==

At 10 p.m. on September 20, British commander Major General Charles Grey marched his forces from the British camp and launched a surprise attack on Wayne&#x27;s camp above the Warren Tavern in present-day Malvern not far from the General Paoli Tavern. Grey&#x27;s troops included the 2nd Light Infantry, a composite battalion formed from the light companies of 13 regiments, plus the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment and 44th Regiment of Foot. A dozen troopers of the 16th Queen&#x27;s Light Dragoons were in the vanguard of the main British column. Altogether, Grey&#x27;s force numbered approximately 1,200 men.

To ensure that the Americans were not alerted, Grey ordered his troops to advance in silence with muskets unloaded and attack with bayonets alone. In the case that loads could not be drawn from weapons, he ordered that the flints should be removed instead, earning the Grey the epithet &quot;No Flint&quot; Grey. Major John Maitland, commanding officer of the 2nd Light Infantry battalion, was given permission to advance with muskets loaded, giving his personal assurance that his men could be relied on not to fire.

Earlier, Wayne received two warnings of a possible attack and sent out mounted sentries, who spotted the British force two miles from the camp and gave the alarm. Reaching Warren Tavern, the British forced a local blacksmith to guide them and approached the camp silently along heavily wooded roads, where they hit a sentry post. Most of the sentries fired into the dark, exposing their position and were annihilated by the silent British vanguard. In the camp up the hill from the pickets, Wayne&#x27;s troops were already formed up and armed. Hearing the firing from the picket on the right, the main body of Wayne&#x27;s force began moving west out of camp in a column through well-fenced fields when a disabled cannon blocked the avenue of escape for several minutes. With loud battle cries, the British stormed into the camp in three waves: the 2nd Light Infantry in the lead, followed by the 44th and the 42nd, and light dragoons sweeping across the camp. Some of Wayne&#x27;s troops fired in the direction of the British attack, exposing their positions in the dark; the rear of Wayne&#x27;s column was silhouetted by their campfires. Some fired into each other and the ensuing chaos caused troops in that part of the line to panic and run. Wayne organized a rearguard defense, but many of his troops fled from the camp and were pursued for a mile or two. Near White Horse Tavern, the British encountered William Smallwood&#x27;s forces and routed it as well.

With only four British killed and seven wounded, the British routed an entire American division. American casualties from the battle are more uncertain. Historian Thomas J. McGuire says that 53 dead Americans were buried on the battlefield but &quot;whether these were all of the American dead or only those found on the campsite-battlefield is uncertain&quot;. Local tradition says that eight more American (and some British) soldiers killed in the battle were buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Church in the Great Valley, an Anglican church. An estimated 71 prisoners were taken by the British, 40 of whom were so badly wounded that they had to be left behind in nearby houses. According to McGuire, a total of 272 men were killed, wounded, or missing from Wayne&#x27;s division after the battle.
McGuire reports that on the day after the battle, 52 dead Americans were buried, and another body was found later. Among the buried, 39 are unnamed. The highest ranking American officer killed was Major Mareen Lamar (sometimes misspelled Marien).

==Aftermath==

An official inquiry found that Wayne was not guilty of misconduct but that he had made a tactical error. Wayne was enraged and demanded a full court-martial. On November 1, a board of 13 officers declared that Wayne overruled the inquiry&#x27;s initial report, concluding that Wayne had acted with honor.

The incident gained notoriety partly because of accounts by supposed eyewitnesses, who claimed that the British had bayoneted or mutilated Americans as they were attempting to surrender. Reports included the following:

I with my own Eyes, see them, cut &amp; hack some of our poor Men to pieces after they had fallen in their hands and scarcely shew the least Mercy to any...:— Lt. Col. Adam Hubley, 10th Pennsylvania Regiment
...more than a dozen soldiers had with fixed bayonets formed a cordon round him, and that everyone of them in sport had indulged their brutal ferocity by stabbing him in different parts of his body and limbs...a physician...examining him there was found..46 distinct bayonet wounds...:— William Hutchinson, Pennsylvania Militiaman
The Enemy last Night at twelve o&#x27;clock attacked...Our Men just raised from Sleep, moved disorderly — Confusion followed...The Carnage was very great...this is a bloody Month:— Col. Thomas Hartley, 1st Pennsylvania Regiment
The Annals of the Age Cannot Produce such another Scene of Butchery...:— Maj. Samuel Hay, 7th Pennsylvania Regiment
American military historian Mark M. Boatner III refuted these allegations, writing:
American propagandists succeeded in whipping up anti-British sentiment with false accusations that Grey&#x27;s men had refused quarter and massacred defenseless patriots who tried to surrender...The &quot;no quarter&quot; charge is refuted by the fact that the British took 71 prisoners. The &quot;mangled dead&quot; is explained by the fact that the bayonet is a messy weapon.

Wayne&#x27;s troops swore revenge and &quot;Remember Paoli!&quot; was used by them as a battle cry at the Battles of Germantown and Stony Point.

To show their defiance, the men of the 2nd Light Infantry dyed their hat feathers red so the Americans would be able to identify them. In 1833, the Light Company of the 46th Regiment of Foot were authorized to wear red cap distinctions instead of the regulation Light Infantry green in commemoration of this gesture. 

In 1934, the Royal Berkshire Regiment, which carried on the traditions of the 49th Foot, were authorized to wear a red distinction in their head dress although, misleadingly, this was granted &quot;to commemorate the role of the Light Company at the battle of Brandywine Creek&quot;. In the second half of the 20th century, the descendants of both regiments wore red backing to their cap badges and did so until 2006 when The Light Infantry and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment were absorbed by The Rifles.

==Monument==
In 1877, a granite monument was erected at the site of the battle to replace an 1817 monument that was in poor condition; the Paoli monument inscription replicates the words of the 1817 monument on one side. It stands tall and is inscribed on all four sides and is located in a local park in Malvern that was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 as the Paoli Battlefield Site and Parade Grounds. 

The battlefield and parade grounds include two contributing buildings, two contributing sites, and five contributing objects on its listing with the National Register of Historic Places, including the Paoli battlefield site, the Paoli parade grounds, the Paoli Massacre Monument (erected in 1817), the Paoli Massacre obelisk (erected in 1877), a World War I monument (erected in 1928), a World War II urn (erected circa 1946), and caretaker&#x27;s house and garage (built in 1922).

<text>The Canada Elections Act () is an Act of the Parliament of Canada which regulates the election of members of parliament to the House of Commons of Canada. The Act has been amended many times over Canada&#x27;s history.

The &quot;Canada Election Act&quot; limits spending on election advertising by interest groups, which was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Harper v. Canada (Attorney General)&quot; (2004). It also sets out various provisions regarding the publication or broadcast of election advertising and election results.

In 1989, the government of Canada appointed the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing regarding restrictions in the &quot;Elections Act&quot; inconsistent with Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

In 1996, the &quot;Act&quot; was amended to establish a Register of Electors and the International Register of Electors.

In 2003, the &quot;Act&quot; was extended to cover the nomination contests of registered parties. In 2007, it was amended to mandate fixed election dates.

==Notable provisions==
* Section 56.1 establishes a fixed election date for federal general elections as the third Monday of October in the fourth calendar year following the last general election while retaining the power of the Governor General to dissolve Parliament earlier at their discretion. Its companion section 56.2 permits the Chief Electoral Officer (with the consent of the Cabinet) to shift the election day by either 1 day or 1 week to avoid conflicts with cultural days or with other elections in Canada.
* Section 329 of the &quot;Act&quot; outlawed publishing election results from other ridings in constituencies where polls are still open. This section was upheld by the Supreme Court in &quot;R. v. Bryan&quot; (2007), but was repealed in 2015 because the wide use of the internet and social media had made it outdated and difficult to enforce.
* Section 335 requires that all broadcasters make 6.5 hours of advertising available for purchase by political parties over the course of a general election during &quot;prime time&quot; (the evening hours for TV stations and specialty channels, and morning and afternoon drive for radio stations). Even broadcasters that do not ordinarily accept advertising, such as the CBC&#x27;s radio services, and (since 2017) premium pay TV channels like Crave/HBO and Super Channel, are required to accept these political ads during a federal election.
* Section 345 requires that all CRTC-licensed over-the-air radio and television networks, which reach the majority of Canadians in the language of broadcast, allocate free time for election broadcasts (in addition to the paid availabilities described above). However, there are no restrictions on when these free-time broadcasts must air, and most of these networks now confine them to late night.
** As of 2011, the networks subject to this provision are CBC Television, Ici Radio-Canada Télé, CBC Radio One, Ici Radio-Canada Première, TVA, and V. The amount of free time per election varies by network, from roughly 3.5 hours (for the CBC&#x27;s TV networks) to 62 minutes (for TVA and V).
** Historically, CTV and the Radiomédia / Corus Québec radio network were also subject to free-time allocations; the Corus Québec network has since ceased operation, while CTV has not operated under a CRTC-issued national network licence since 2001 (and other &quot;networks&quot; such as Global have never operated under such licences). Note that there is currently no free-time allocation required for individual private radio or television stations, or cable specialty channels.
* Section 482(b), which finds anyone who &quot;induces a person to vote or refrain from voting or to vote or refrain from voting for a particular candidate at an election&quot; guilty of intimidation of the electoral process. Anyone convicted under s. 482(b) faces, on a summary conviction, a maximum $2,000 fine, or a maximum of one year in prison, or both. On an indictment, individuals found guilty face a maximum of five years in prison, a maximum $5,000 fine, or both.

==Political action committees==

In 2015, wealthy U.S.-style political action committees (PAC) organizations were introduced to Ontario and Alberta and were expected to play a major role in Canadian political elections at the provincial and federal level. PACs are new to Canadian federal politics and are &quot;technically federal non-profit corporations&quot; registered with Industry Canada. The &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot; allows PACs to &quot;spend up to $150,000 on third-party advertising during an election&quot; but &quot;spending outside the election period is [/was] unlimited.&quot; up until the enactment of the &quot;Elections Modernization Act&quot; in 2018, even after which spending was nonetheless unlimited outside of the defined pre-election periods. In Ontario, the union-funded Working Families Coalition, spent millions on anti-conservative ads before the 2015 Ontario provincial elections. The left-leaning organization Engage Canada, which released its first anti-Harper attack ad early June 2015. The right-leaning Conservative PAC Foundation founded by high-profile Alberta conservatives Jonathan Denis, Brad Tennant and Zoe Addington in June 2015 funded advertising in support of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The developer-funded right-wing group Ontario Proud and related groups have been active in Canadian elections since 2018.

<doc id="563525" wikidata="Q523137" url="?curid=563525" title="Montenegrin Orthodox Church">
<text>The Montenegrin Orthodox Church (, Црногорска православна црква; abbr. MOC, CPC or ЦПЦ) is a canonically unrecognized Eastern Orthodox Church. It was formed in 1993 and registered as a non-governmental organization. Antonije Abramović was appointed as its first metropolitan. It claims succession to an older and autocephalous Montenegrin Church, which operated until the unification of the Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Montenegro, later to join the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918.

The Montenegrin Orthodox Church has been recognized as a religious organization by the Government of Montenegro since 2001. According to a 2020 poll conducted by CEDEM, approximately 10 percent of Montenegro&#x27;s Eastern Orthodox Christians have opted for the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, while approximately 90 percent have opted for or stayed with the Serbian Orthodox Church in the canonical or widely-known Eastern Orthodox Church. Notably, the creation of the MOC has been opposed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Patriarch Bartholomew has stated that &quot;we will never give autocephaly to the so-called &#x27;Montenegrin Orthodox Church&#x27;&quot; and that its leader Dedeić was suspended by Constantinople for adultery and embezzlement.

== History ==
The first ideas about creating a special Orthodox church of ethnic Montenegrins arose outside Montenegro, at a time when Montenegrin fascists and collaborators led by Sekula Drljević gathered under the auspices of the Ustaša regime in the Independent State of Croatia. During 1943 and 1944, under the influence of the clerical-fascist ideology of the Ustaša movement, Drljević formulated a thesis on the diversity of Montenegrin Orthodoxy not only in relation to Serbian Orthodoxy, but also in relation to Orthodoxy in general. On that occasion, he coined the notion of &quot;crnogorоslavlje&quot;, putting it in opposition to . Looking at the Ustaša project of the Croatian Orthodox Church, Drljevic claimed that &quot;the Montenegrin Church has not been in any dependence of any Orthodox Church for all centuries.&quot;

The Montenegrin Orthodox Church was founded in Cetinje on October 31, 1993, led by Antonije Abramović who was appointed as patriarch, initially with the support of the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro (LSCG), a pro-Montenegrin independence political party that existed at the time. At the time, Montenegro was part of the federal state with Serbia called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was formed a year earlier following a 1992 referendum. LSCG, a party with a pro-independence agenda, is claimed to have used the MOC as a tool in their quest for Montenegrin sovereignty. At that time, the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) maintained close ties to Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s administration in Serbia, and therefore the initial activities of the MOC were very sporadic.

After the death of Metropolitan Antonije, he was replaced by Metropolitan Dedeić. Most liberals did not approve of this change, and their support for the church soon started to fade. By 1997, the DPS administration in Montenegro led by Milo Đukanović began to distance itself from Milošević, and started supporting and financing the church, which received support from both the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro and the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro; however, after 2001 this support seemingly waned.

On January 17, 2001, the MOC was officially registered as a non-governmental organization at the local department of the Montenegrin Ministry of the Interior. In the absence of any other relevant and more current piece of legislation, this registration was done by calling on the &quot;Law on the Legal Position of Religious Communities&quot; from 1977 when Montenegro was a socialist republic within SFR Yugoslavia.

In 2007, the MOC attempted to expand its activities beyond the borders of Montenegro. Serbia originally refused to allow the MOC to be registered as an organization, as all canonical Eastern Orthodox churches have also refused to recognize the MOC. However, on appeal, the Serbian Supreme Court ruled this position unconstitutional, overturning the refusal and paving the way for a potential permission to register.

The Montenegrin Orthodox Church has offered to issue a baptismal certificate in which in the column &quot;nationality&quot;, instead of an &quot;Orthodox Serb&quot; will be changed to &quot;Orthodox Montenegrin.&quot; Following continued ethnic tension, in 2021, Montenegrins and Serbs clashed over leadership in the Serbian Orthodox Church within Montenegro.

On September 3, 2023, which marked the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, a major split in the church occurred when Bishop Boris Bojović was proclaimed the new Metropolitan of the church. This decision was made by the MOC general assembly held in Cetinje and was supported by a group of younger priests loyal to Bojović, as well as the hundreds of citizens gathered at the assembly. The assembly also declared the official retirement of former Metropolitan Dedeić, and proclaimed the MOC founder and former Metropolitan Abramović as a saint of the church. Dedeić sharply rejected the declaration of the assembly, calling it &quot;a failed political rally,&quot; and stating that &quot;street rallies cannot change the metropolitan and elect a new one next to a living and healthy leader.&quot; In October 2023, Dedeić&#x27;s proposal was rejected by the basic court in Cetinje that asked to prohibit Bojović from performing religious services in MOC churches.

On June 24, 2024, the Supreme Administrative Court of Montenegro issued a judgment ordering the Ministry of Justice to recognize Metropolitan Boris as the head of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. This decision ended the ongoing administrative crisis resulting from the Ministry&#x27;s refusal to register Metropolitan Boris as the new leader of the Church. The court found that the ministerial rejection of the request was unjustified, taking into account the religious autonomy of the church and the invalidity of internal statutes that had not been officially promulgated. The new leader was elected in accordance with tradition at the General Montenegrin People&#x27;s Assembly on September 3, 2023.

== Leadership and organization ==
As of 2024, the Montenegrin Orthodox Church is led by the Archbishop of Cetinje and Montenegro Metropolitan Boris.

At a General Montenegrin People&#x27;s Assembly formed by the MOC in Cetinje on January 6, 1997, Metropolitan Mihailo was chosen by traditional public acclamation the Head of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. In the Church of St. Paraskeva in Sofia, on March 15, 1998, he was ordained as bishop by Bulgarian Alternative Synod&#x27;s head Patriarch Pimen and seven metropolitans and bishops of his synod. He was enthroned to Metropolitan of Montenegrin Orthodox Church in Cetinje on October 31, 1998, in the presence of several hundred believers and supporters of Montenegrin Orthodox Church.

Metropolitan Mihailo had worked as a professor for the Serbian Orthodox Church and then as a priest of the Greek Orthodox Church in Italy, where he created a Serbian Orthodox municipality out of the Greek Church, leading after a number of scandals, including adultery and accusations of embezzlement, to his permanent suspension from the church in 1995. After becoming Metropolitan of the MOC in 1997, he was fully excommunicated by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople from the Eastern Orthodox Church.

On January 11, 2007, the MOC created its own holy synod and proclaimed its first decree. This holy synod is constituted by archpriests of the church, led by the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. This synod divided Montenegro in five eparchies—Cetinjska, Dukljanska, Primorska, Ostroška and Beranska.

=== Within Montenegro ===

The Montenegrin Orthodox Church currently holds its regular services in several chapels in the area of Montenegro&#x27;s royal capital, Cetinje, as well as a church in Kotor. Open-air services are held across Montenegro for Christmas and Easter. The MOC officially opened a new shrine in the old town of Kotor in 2006, following the referendum on independence.

=== Outside Montenegro ===
Construction of the first MOC churches abroad, the Holy Church of Righteous Ivan Crnojević, was planned to take place in Lovćenac, Vojvodina, Serbia, with the help of the Association of Ethnic Montenegrins in Serbia Krstaš. A contract for the land on which the new MOC shrine will be built was signed on 5 August 2005.

The Montenegrin Orthodox Church also has support from abroad, and it has managed to build several churches and missions in North America, South America, Australia, Western Europe all home to important Montenegrin émigré communities, most of whom also support the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. Services are held in the Australian state of New South Wales as well as in the Argentine province of Chaco, which is the base of Archimandrite Gorazd Glomazic and the Montenegrin Church of Saint Nikola in the colony of Machagay.

== Claim to Serbian Orthodox churches ==
In April 2007 the &quot;President of the Council for the promotion&quot; of the MOC, Stevo Vučinić, was quoted as saying the &quot;we [the MOC] will retake of all the churches and chapels in the towns, and of course the village churches, and the monasteries...we expect resistance, but in no case will we give up&quot;.

On Wednesday, April 18, 2007, the representatives of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church – which has announced that it did not wish to cause an &quot;excessive situation&quot;, but that it would enter the Serbian Orthodox Cetinje monastery without regard to the reaction of the Serbian Orthodox Church to their claims and requests – attempted to do so. Special police units prevented their forceful entry and that of several hundred supporters of the MOC. There was some pushing and shoving between the police, and the crowd which had intended to force its way into the monastery. Following this, members of the crowd shouted slogans such as &quot;this isn&#x27;t Serbia&quot;, &quot;whose police are you?&quot; and &quot;Risto, Satan&quot; (a reference to Metropolitan Amfilohije of the SOC).

In September 2008, Serbian Orthodox locals attempted to launch a blockade in the Nikšić area to prevent the MOC from building a church there. Sixty-five people were arrested for violating public order.

== Recognition ==
=== Support from other churches ===
The Montenegrin Orthodox Church has support from a number of likewise non-canonical or unrecognized Eastern Orthodox churches: the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate, the Bulgarian Alternative Orthodox Church (founded by patriarch Pimen), and its Italian-based branch, the Orthodox Church in Italy.

The MOC had original support of the then-unrecognized Macedonian Orthodox Church, which was later withdrawn as the Macedonian Church entered negotiations for restoration into communion.

Following the granting of autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine by Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I, rumor spread that the Montenegrin Orthodox Church may soon receive a similar recognition; however, this was denied by Patriarch Bartholomew, who stated that &quot;we will never give autocephaly to the so-called &#x27;Montenegrin Orthodox Church&#x27;&quot; and that its leader Dedeić was suspended by Constantinople for adultery and embezzlement. In December 2022, Mihailo was granted an audience with Pope Francis at the Holy See.

=== Support from political parties ===
Political parties in Montenegro that so far officially stated support of the MOC have been: the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro and minority Croatian Civic Initiative, officially proposing it to be mentioned in Montenegro&#x27;s new Constitution, which eventually did not mention it with its adoption in late 2007. The Initiative invited representatives of both the Montenegrin and Serbian churches to a special municipal meeting in Tivat, sparking a boycott among local Serbian politicians.

During the occasion of 2008 Serbian elections, the church had the support of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians which stated it should be a recognized religion in the country. After its 9th Congress, the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro also endorsed the MOC as legitimate Church of Montenegro.

=== Public opinion ===
According to data of Centre of Democracy in Montenegro from February 2007, the Serbian Orthodox Church was the most trusted institution in Montenegro by public opinion (coefficient 3.29), while the Montenegrin Orthodox Church was ranked sixth (coefficient 2.35). According to a 2020 poll conducted by CEDEM, approximately 10% percent of Montenegro&#x27;s Eastern Orthodox Christians have opted for the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, while approximately 90% percent have opted for or stayed with the canonical Serbian Orthodox Church.

<doc id="563529" wikidata="Q1128309" url="?curid=563529" title="Organ of Corti">
<text>The organ of Corti, or spiral organ, is the receptor organ for hearing and is located in the mammalian cochlea. This highly varied strip of epithelial cells allows for transduction of auditory signals into nerve impulses&#x27; action potential. Transduction occurs through vibrations of structures in the inner ear causing displacement of cochlear fluid and movement of hair cells at the organ of Corti to produce electrochemical signals.

Italian anatomist Alfonso Giacomo Gaspare Corti (1822–1876) discovered the organ of Corti in 1851. The structure evolved from the basilar papilla and is crucial for mechanotransduction in mammals.

==Structure==
The organ of Corti is located in the scala media of the cochlea of the inner ear between the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct and is composed of mechanosensory cells, known as hair cells. Strategically positioned on the basilar membrane of the organ of Corti are three rows of outer hair cells (OHCs) and one row of inner hair cells (IHCs). Surrounding these hair cells are supporting cells: Deiters cells, also called phalangeal cells, which have a close relation with the OHCs, and pillar cells, which separate and support both the OHCs and the IHCs.

Projecting from the tops of the hair cells are tiny finger-like projections called stereocilia, which are arranged in a graduated fashion with the shortest stereocilia on the outer rows and the longest in the center. This gradation is thought to be the most important anatomic feature of the organ of Corti because this allows the sensory cells superior tuning capability.

If the cochlea were uncoiled, it would roll out to be about 33 mm long in women and 34 mm in men, with about 2.28 mm of standard deviation for the population. The cochlea is also tonotopically organized, meaning that different frequencies of sound waves interact with different locations on the structure. The base of the cochlea, closest to the outer ear, is the most stiff and narrow and is where the high-frequency sounds are transduced. The apex, or top, of the cochlea is wider and much more flexible and loose and functions as the transduction site for low-frequency sounds.

==Function==

The function of the organ of Corti is to convert (transduce) sounds into electrical signals that can be transmitted to the brainstem through the auditory nerve. It is the auricle and middle ear that act as mechanical transformers and amplifiers so that the sound waves end up with amplitudes 22 times greater than when they entered the ear.

=== Auditory transduction ===
In normal hearing, the majority of the auditory signals that reach the organ of Corti in the first place come from the outer ear. Sound waves enter through the auditory canal and vibrate the tympanic membrane, also known as the eardrum, which vibrates three small bones called the ossicles. As a result, the attached oval window moves and causes movement of the round window, which leads to displacement of the cochlear fluid.
However, the stimulation can happen also via direct vibration of the cochlea from the skull. The latter is referred to as Bone Conduction (or BC) hearing, as complementary to the first one described, which is instead called Air Conduction (or AC) hearing. Both AC and BC stimulate the basilar membrane in the same way (Békésy, G.v., Experiments in Hearing. 1960).

The basilar membrane on the tympanic duct presses against the hair cells of the organ as perilymphatic pressure waves pass. The stereocilia atop the IHCs move with this fluid displacement and in response their cation, or positive ion selective, channels are pulled open by cadherin structures called tip links that connect adjacent stereocilia. The organ of Corti, surrounded in potassium-rich fluid endolymph, lies on the basilar membrane at the base of the scala media. Under the organ of Corti is the scala tympani and above it, the scala vestibuli. Both structures exist in a low potassium fluid called perilymph. Because those stereocilia are in the midst of a high concentration of potassium, once their cation channels are pulled open, potassium ions as well as calcium ions flow into the top of the hair cell. With this influx of positive ions the IHC becomes depolarized, opening voltage-gated calcium channels at the basolateral region of the hair cells and triggering the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. An electrical signal is then sent through the auditory nerve and into the auditory cortex of the brain as a neural message.

=== Cochlear amplification ===

The organ of Corti is also capable of modulating the auditory signal. The outer hair cells (OHCs) can amplify the signal through a process called electromotility where they increase movement of the basilar and tectorial membranes and therefore increase deflection of stereocilia in the IHCs.

A crucial piece to this cochlear amplification is the motor protein prestin, which changes shape based on the voltage potential inside of the hair cell. When the cell is depolarized, prestin shortens, and because it is located on the membrane of OHCs it then pulls on the basilar membrane and increasing how much the membrane is deflected, creating a more intense effect on the inner hair cells (IHCs). When the cell hyperpolarizes prestin lengthens and eases tension on the IHCs, which decreases the neural impulses to the brain. In this way, the hair cell itself is able to modify the auditory signal before it even reaches the brain.

==Development==
The organ of Corti, in between the scala tympani and the scala media, develops after the formation and growth of the cochlear duct. The inner and outer hair cells then differentiate into their appropriate positions and are followed by the organization of the supporting cells. The topology of the supporting cells lends itself to the actual mechanical properties that are needed for the highly specialized sound-induced movements within the organ of Corti.

Development and growth of the organ of Corti relies on specific genes, many of which have been identified in previous research (SOX2, GATA3, EYA1, FOXG1, BMP4, RAC1, and more), to undergo such differentiation. Specifically, the cochlear duct growth and the formation of hair cells within the organ of Corti.

Mutations in the genes expressed in or near the organ of Corti before the differentiation of hair cells will result in a disruption in the differentiation, and potential malfunction of, the organ of Corti.

==Clinical significance==

=== Hearing loss ===

The organ of Corti can be damaged by excessive sound levels, leading to noise-induced impairment.

The most common kind of hearing impairment, sensorineural hearing loss, includes as one major cause the reduction of function in the organ of Corti. Specifically, the active amplification function of the outer hair cells is very sensitive to damage from exposure to trauma from overly-loud sounds or to certain ototoxic drugs. Once outer hair cells are damaged, they do not regenerate, and the result is a loss of sensitivity and an abnormally large growth of loudness (known as &quot;recruitment&quot;) in the part of the spectrum that the damaged cells serve.

While hearing loss has always been considered irreversible in mammals, fish and birds routinely repair such damage. A 2013 study has shown that the use of particular drugs may reactivate genes normally expressed only during hair cell development. The research was carried out at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, and the Keio University School of Medicine in Japan.

<text>The barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) is a unit of energy based on the approximate energy released by burning one barrel (, or about ) of crude oil. The BOE is used by oil and gas companies in their financial statements as a way of combining oil and natural gas reserves and production into a single measure, although this energy equivalence does not take into account the lower financial value of energy in the form of gas.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration defines the barrel of oil equivalent as about . The value is necessarily approximate as various grades of oil and gas have slightly different heating values. If one considers the lower heating value instead of the higher heating value, the value for one BOE would be approximately 5.4 GJ (see tonne of oil equivalent). Typically is equivalent to one BOE. The United States Geological Survey gives a figure of of typical natural gas.

Due to the risk of confusion The Society of Petroleum Engineers recommends in their style guide that abbreviations or prefixes M or MM are not used for barrels of oil or barrel of oil equivalent, but rather that thousands, millions or billions are spelled out. Common prefixes for readers familiar with the metric system are k for thousand, M for million and G for billion while other readers might be more familiar with M for thousand, MM for million and B for billion. All those multiples are commonly combined with barrel of oil equivalent from the level of individual production units output per day to level of petroleum reserves.

Metric regions commonly use the tonne of oil equivalent (toe), or more often million toe (Mtoe). Since this is a measurement of mass, any conversion to barrels of oil equivalent depends on the density of the oil in question, as well as the energy content. Typically 1 tonne of oil has a volume of . The United States EIA suggests 1 toe has an average energy value of .

<text>Heinrich Friedrich Emil Lenz (; also Emil Khristianovich Lenz; ; 12 February 1804 – 10 February 1865), usually cited as Emil Lenz or Heinrich Lenz in some countries, was an Estonian physicist who is most noted for formulating Lenz&#x27;s law in electrodynamics in 1834.

==Biography==
Lenz was born in Dorpat (nowadays Tartu, Estonia), at that time in the Governorate of Livonia in the Russian Empire. After completing his secondary education in 1820, Lenz studied chemistry and physics at the University of Dorpat. He traveled with the navigator Otto von Kotzebue on his third expedition around the world from 1823 to 1826. On the voyage Lenz studied climatic conditions and the physical properties of seawater. The results were published in &quot;Memoirs of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences&quot; (1831).

After the voyage, Lenz began working at the University of St. Petersburg, Russia, where he later served as the Dean of Mathematics and Physics from 1840 to 1863 and was Rector from 1863 until his death in 1865. Lenz also taught at the Petrischule in 1830 and 1831, and at the Mikhailovskaya Artillery Academy.

Lenz had begun studying electromagnetism in 1831. Besides the law named in his honor, Lenz also independently discovered Joule&#x27;s law in 1842; to honor his efforts on the problem, it is also given the name the &quot;Joule–Lenz law,&quot; named also for James Prescott Joule.

Lenz eagerly participated in development of the electroplating technology, invented by his friend and colleague Moritz von Jacobi. In 1839, Lenz produced several medallions using electrotyping. Along with the electrotyped relief produced by Jacobi the same year, these were the first instances of galvanoplastic sculpture.
Lenz died in Rome, after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage.

A lunar crater on the far side of the Moon is named after him.

<doc id="563544" wikidata="Q2587464" url="?curid=563544" title="ZX Interface 1">
<text>The ZX Interface 1, launched in 1983, was a peripheral from Sinclair Research for its ZX Spectrum home computer. Originally intended as a local area network interface for use in school classrooms, it was revised before launch to also act as the controller for up to eight ZX Microdrive high-speed tape-loop cartridge drives. It also included a DE-9 RS-232 interface capable of operating at up to 19.2 kbit/s. At hardware level it was fundamentally a voltage adaptor, the serial protocol being implemented in software by bit-banging. This led to problems when receiving data, but not when transmitting.

A wedge-shaped device fitting underneath the ZX Spectrum, the Interface 1 required two screws to be removed from the underside of the Spectrum, the existing screwholes being used by longer screws running through the ZX Interface 1 to stop it from inadvertently becoming detached. The Interface 1 contained of ROM comprising the control software for the Microdrives, an RS-232 port and network interface. This extended the error handler in the Sinclair BASIC to allow extra keywords to be used. As this became an official standard, other developers quickly used this mechanism to create language extensions to Sinclair BASIC.

Two further revisions of the device&#x27;s firmware were made following launch. These aimed to improve ZX Microdrive cartridge formatting and access time, printing functions via the RS-232 interface, and other bugs in the firmware held in the device&#x27;s internal 8K ROM. Machine code software which used the officially documented entry points (&#x27;hook codes&#x27;) would experience few incompatibility issues; however, programs using non-standard entry points risked incompatibility due to the presence of revised entry points.

The same protocol, renamed QLAN, was later used on the Sinclair QL. This was intended to be interoperable with ZX Net, but due to timing differences interoperability was found to be problematic.

The ZX Interface 1 was incompatible with some later ZX Spectrum models such as the +2A and +3, due to differences in ROM and in the expansion connector. It was therefore impossible to connect and use the Microdrive units with these later models. It did, however, work with the original +2, although the much larger case made the interface an awkward fit.

== Network ==
The device offered two network ports, allowing up to 64 ZX Spectrums to be daisy-chained using network leads up to long. The network, called ZX Net, used a bidirectional wire with a proprietary CSMA-like protocol. Data could be sent or received at either to or from a numbered workstation, or broadcast to all nodes, allowing one machine to act as a server.

Station number 0 is used to indicate broadcast. Data is transmitted in packets, each a maximum of 255 bytes long; the packet and the header are protected by a checksum. Character transmission uses 1 start bit, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit (the common 8-N-1 configuration).

Main commands:
:FORMAT &quot;n&quot;;&lt;station number&gt;
:SAVE * &quot;n&quot;;&lt;station number&gt;
:LOAD * &quot;n&quot;;&lt;station number&gt;

Select for example 1 as the address of the first computer (station number):
:FORMAT &quot;n&quot;;1
:SAVE * &quot;n&quot;;2

Select 2 for the second computer address:
:FORMAT &quot;n&quot;;2
:LOAD * &quot;n&quot;;1

Which will then transfer the program from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;2&quot;.

Other commands:
:CAT # Lists the file and directory contents of unit #
:LOAD * &quot;m&quot;;1;&quot;name&quot; # Loads the program &quot;name&quot; from &quot;microdrive&quot; unit 1

<doc id="563545" wikidata="Q332478" url="?curid=563545" title="Absolute music">
<text>Absolute music (sometimes abstract music) is music that is not explicitly &quot;about&quot; anything; in contrast to program music, it is non-representational. The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early German Romanticism, such as Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder, Ludwig Tieck and E. T. A. Hoffmann but the term was not coined until 1846 where it was first used by Richard Wagner in a programme to Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony.

The aesthetic ideas underlying absolute music derive from debates over the relative value of what was known in the early years of aesthetic theory as the fine arts. Kant, in his &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot;, dismissed music as &quot;more a matter of enjoyment than culture&quot; and &quot;less worth in the judgement of reason than any other of the fine arts&quot; because of its lack of conceptual content, thus treating as a deficit the very feature of music that others celebrated. Johann Gottfried Herder, in contrast, regarded music as the highest of the arts because of its spirituality, which Herder attributed to the invisibility of sound. The ensuing arguments among musicians, composers, music historians and critics continue today.

== Romantic debate ==

A group of Romantics consisting of Johann Gottfried Herder, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Jean Paul Richter and E.T.A. Hoffmann gave rise to the idea of what can be labeled as &quot;spiritual absolutism&quot;. In this respect, instrumental music transcends other arts and languages to become the discourse of a &#x27;higher realm&#x27;, an idea expressed in Hoffmann&#x27;s review of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony, published in 1813. These thinkers believed that music could be more emotionally powerful and stimulating without words. According to Richter, music would eventually &#x27;outlast&#x27; the word.

==Formalist debate==
Formalism is the concept of music for music&#x27;s sake, or that music&#x27;s &#x27;meaning&#x27; is entirely in its form. In this respect, music has no extra-musical meaning at all and is enjoyed by appreciation of its formal structure and technical construction. The 19th century music critic Eduard Hanslick argued that music could be enjoyed as pure sound and form, and that it needed no connotation of extra-musical elements to warrant its existence. He argued that in fact, these extra-musical ideas and images detracted from the beauty of the music.

Formalism therefore rejected genres such as opera, song and tone poems as they conveyed explicit meanings or programmatic imagery. Symphonic forms were considered more aesthetically pure. (The choral finale of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, as well as the programmatic Sixth Symphony, became problematic to formalist critics who had championed the composer as a pioneer of the Absolute, especially with the late Beethoven string quartets). Carl Dahlhaus described absolute music as music without a &quot;concept, object, and purpose&quot;.

===Opposition and objections to absolute music===

Richard Wagner was a vocal opponent of absolute music, a phrase he coined. Wagner considered the choral finale of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony to be the proof that music works better with words, famously saying: &quot;Where music can go no further, there comes the word ... the word stands higher than the tone.&quot; Wagner also called Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony the death knell of the symphony, for he was far more interested in combining all forms of art with his .

==Contemporary views==
Today, the debate continues over whether music has, or ought to have, extramusical meaning or not. However, most contemporary views, reflecting ideas emerging from views of subjectivity in linguistic meaning arising in cognitive linguistics, as well as Kuhn&#x27;s work on cultural biases in science and other ideas on meaning and aesthetics (e.g. Wittgenstein on cultural constructions in thought and language), appear to be moving 
towards a consensus that music provides at least some signification or meaning, in terms of which it is &quot;understood&quot;.

The cultural bases of musical understanding have been highlighted in Philip Bohlman&#x27;s work, who considers music as a form of cultural communication:

Bohlman has gone on to argue that the use of music, e.g. among the Jewish diaspora, was in fact a form of &quot;identity building&quot;.

Susan McClary has criticised the notion of &#x27;absolute music&#x27;, arguing that all music, whether explicitly programmatic or not, contains implicit programs that reflect the tastes, politics, aesthetic philosophies and social attitudes of the composer and their historical situation. Such scholars would argue that classical music is rarely about nothing, but reflects aesthetic tastes that are themselves influenced by culture, politics and philosophy. Composers are often bound up in a web of tradition and influence, in which they strive to consciously situate themselves in relation to other composers and styles. Lawrence Kramer, on the other hand, believes music has no means to reserve a &quot;specific layer or pocket for meaning. Once it has been brought into sustainable connection with a structure of prejudgment, music simply becomes meaningful.&quot;

Music which appears to demand an interpretation, but is abstract enough to warrant objectivity (e.g. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 6th Symphony), is what Lydia Goehr refers to as &quot;double-sided autonomy&quot;. This happens when the formalist properties of music became attractive to composers because, having no meaning to speak of, music could be used to envision an alternative cultural and/or political order, while escaping the scrutiny of the censor.

===Linguistic meaning===
On the topic of musical meaning, 
Wittgenstein, at several points in his late diary &quot;Culture and Value&quot;, ascribes meaning to music, for instance, that in the finale, 
a conclusion is being drawn, e.g.:
Jerrold Levinson has drawn extensively on Wittgenstein to comment:

<text>The Beechcraft XA-38 &quot;Grizzly&quot; was a World War II-era ground attack aircraft, developed by Beechcraft, but never put into production. The Grizzly was to have been fitted with a forward-firing 75 mm cannon to penetrate heavily armored targets.

While the first prototype flew on 7 May 1944, testing established that the type would not be ready for the projected invasion of Japan. It also featured the Wright R-3350 engines already in use with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress—which had priority. Consequently, the XA-38 was canceled after a second prototype had been completed.

==Design and development==
The United States Army Air Forces awarded the Beech Aircraft Corporation a contract in December 1942 for two prototypes for their Model 28 &quot;Destroyer&quot;. to give a powerful ground attack aircraft to replace the Douglas A-20 Havoc, with the ability to hit &quot;hardened&quot; targets like tanks and bunkers and to attack coastal shipping. This capability was achieved through a 75 mm cannon with 20 rounds, mounted in a fixed position on the nose as well as two .50 cal (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns firing forward. Defensive armament consisted of remotely controlled ventral and dorsal turrets, each armed with twin .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns. There were to be two crew members, a pilot and an observer/gunner in the rear cabin, using periscope sights to aim the guns.

==Testing==
On 7 May 1944, Beech test pilot Vern Carstens flew the XA-38 on its maiden flight from the company&#x27;s Wichita airfield. The aircraft proved satisfactory in all respects and better than expected in some, including top speed.

During testing, the XA-38 prototypes were flown by USAAF pilots and serviced by military personnel, proving to be reliable and establishing a high level of serviceability.

The armament proved especially effective; if not for a shift in wartime priorities in 1944, the aircraft would most likely have been ordered in quantity even though the B-29 had priority for the Wright R-3350 engines. Instead, one prototype was scrapped and the other, intended for the USAF Museum, had an unknown fate.

<text>The Catholic Church in France, or French Catholic Church, is part of the worldwide Catholic Church in communion with the Pope in Rome. Established in the 2nd century in unbroken communion with the bishop of Rome, it was sometimes called the &quot;eldest daughter of the church&quot; ().

The first written records of Christians in France date from the 2nd century when Irenaeus detailed the deaths of ninety-year-old bishop Saint Pothinus of Lugdunum (Lyon) and other martyrs of the 177 AD persecution in Lyon. In 496 Remigius baptized King Clovis I, who therefore converted from paganism to Catholicism. In 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, forming the political and religious foundations of Christendom in Europe and establishing in earnest the French government&#x27;s long historical association with the Catholic Church. In reaction, the French Revolution (1789–1799) was followed by heavy persecution of the Catholic Church. Since the beginning of the 20th century, &quot;Laïcité&quot;, absolute neutrality of the state with respect to religious doctrine, is the official policy of the French Republic.

Estimates of the proportion of Catholics in 2020 range between 47% and 88% of France&#x27;s population, with the higher figure including lapsed Catholics and &quot;Catholic atheists&quot;. The Catholic Church in France is organised into 98 dioceses, which in 2012 were served by 7,000 sub-75 priests. 80 to 90 priests are ordained every year, although the church would need eight times as many to compensate the number of priest deaths. Approximately 45,000 Catholic church buildings and chapels are spread out among 36,500 cities, towns, and villages in France, but a majority are no longer regularly used for mass. Notable churches of France include Notre Dame de Paris, Chartres Cathedral, Dijon Cathedral, Reims Cathedral, Saint-Sulpice, Paris, Basilique du Sacre-Coeur, Strasbourg Cathedral, Eglise de la Madeleine, and Amiens Cathedral. Its national shrine, Lourdes, is visited by 5 million pilgrims yearly. The capital city, Paris, is a major pilgrimage site for Catholics as well.

In recent decades, France has emerged as a stronghold for the small but growing Traditionalist Catholic movement, along with the United States, England and other English-speaking countries. The Society of Saint Pius X, a canonically irregular priestly society founded by French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre has a large presence in the country, as do other traditionalist priestly societies in full communion with Rome such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest and others.

Some of the most famous French saints and blesseds include St. Denis, St. Thérèse of Lisieux, St. Irenaeus, St. John Vianney (the Curé of Ars), St. Joan of Arc, St. Bernadette, St. Genevieve, Louis IX of France, St. Elizabeth of the Trinity, St. Vincent de Paul, St. Louise de Marillac, St. Catherine Labouré, St. Louis de Montfort, St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, St. Francis de Sales, St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, Bl. Nicholas Barré, St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort and St. Bernard of Clairvaux.

==History==
===Roman Gauls and early Christianity===
According to long-standing tradition, Mary, Martha, Lazarus (Marie, Marthe and Lazare in French) and some companions, who were expelled by persecutions from the Holy Land, traversed the Mediterranean in a frail boat with neither rudder nor mast and landed at &quot;Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer&quot; near Arles. Provençal tradition names Lazarus as the first bishop of Marseille, while Martha purportedly went on to tame a terrible beast in nearby Tarascon. Pilgrims visited their tombs at the abbey of Vézelay in Burgundy. In the Abbey of the Trinity at Vendôme, a phylactery was said to contain a tear shed by Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus. The cathedral of Autun, not far away, is dedicated to Lazarus as &quot;Saint Lazaire&quot;.

The first written records of Christians in France date from the 2nd century when Irenaeus detailed the deaths of ninety-year-old bishop Pothinus of Lugdunum (Lyon) and other martyrs of the 177 persecution in Lyon.

The emperor Theodosius I (r. 379-95) makes Christianity the official state religion of the Roman Empire in 380.

===Conversion of the Franks===
In 496, Remigius baptized Clovis I, who was converted from paganism to Catholicism. Clovis I, considered the founder of France, made himself the ally and protector of the papacy and his predominantly Catholic subjects.

===Medieval Christendom and Crusades===

On Christmas Day 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, forming the political and religious foundations of Christendom and establishing in earnest the French government&#x27;s longstanding historical association with the Catholic Church.

The Council of Clermont, a mixed synod of ecclesiastics and laymen led by Pope Urban II in November 1095 at Clermont-Ferrand triggered the First Crusade.

The Kingdom of France and its aristocracy were prominent players in the Crusades in general. Following the Fourth Crusade, a period known as the &quot;Frankokratia&quot; existed where French Latin Catholics took over parts of the Byzantine Empire. A crusade also took place on French territory in the County of Toulouse (contemporary Languedoc) with the Albigensian Crusade in the 13th century, called by Pope Innocent III. This played out on local level with fighting between the Catholic White Brotherhood and the Cathar Black Brotherhood. The Cathars lost and were subsequently exterminated. In 1312, the French monarch Philip IV of France was involved in the suppression of the Knights Templar by Pope Clement V; Philip was in deep financial dept to the Templars.

The Avignon Papacy was the period from 1309 to 1377 during which seven French popes, resided in Avignon.

===Renaissance Church and Protestantism===
Prior to the French Revolution, the Catholic Church had been the official state religion of France since the conversion to Christianity of Clovis I, leading to France being called &quot;the eldest daughter of the Church&quot;. The King of France was known as &quot;His Most Christian Majesty&quot;. Following the Protestant Reformation, France was riven by sectarian conflict as the Huguenots and Catholics strove for supremacy in the Wars of Religion until the 1598 Edict of Nantes established a measure of religious toleration.

===Catholicism under the Revolution===
The French Revolution radically shifted power away from the Catholic Church. Church property was confiscated, and the church crop tax and special clergy privileges were eliminated. With the 1790 Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the clergy became employees of the State, and the Catholic Church became a subordinate arm of the secular French government. During the Reign of Terror, traditional Christian holidays were abolished and Catholic priests were brutally suppressed, locally through mass imprisonment and executions by drowning.

Napoleon Bonaparte negotiated a reconciliation with the Church through the 1801 Concordat, whereby the State would subsidize Catholicism (recognized as the majority religion of the French), as well as Judaism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism. After the 1814 Bourbon Restoration, the ultra-royalist government, headed by the comte de Villèle, passed the 1825 Anti-Sacrilege Act, which made stealing of consecrated Hosts punishable by death. Never enforced, this law was repealed in the July Monarchy (1830–1848).

=== Sexual abuse ===
On 5 October 2021, a report was published by the &quot;Independent Commission on Sexual Abuse in the Church&quot; (CIASE) which showed that up to 330,000 children had become victims of sexual abuse within the church in France over a period spanning 7 decades (1950–2020). This constitutes 6% of total sexual abuse in France, since the same report notes that there are a total of 5.5 million cases of sexual abuse of people under 18 in France. These crimes were committed by between 2900 and 3200 priests and community members.

==Marian apparitions==
A number of alleged Marian apparitions are associated with France. The best known are the following:
* Our Lady of the Rosary, associated with Dominic de Guzmán at Prouille
* Our Lady of Lourdes, associated with Bernadette Soubirous at Lourdes
* Our Lady of La Salette, associated with Maximin Giraud and Mélanie Calvat at La Salette-Fallavaux
* Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, associated with Catherine Labouré at Rue du Bac, Paris
* Our Lady of Laus, associated with Benoîte Rencurel at Saint-Étienne-le-Laus
* Our Lady of Pontmain, associated with Joseph and Eugène Barbedette at Pontmain
* Our Lady of Pellevoisin, associated with Estelle Faguette at Pellevoisin

==Organisation==

===Legal status===
The 1905 French law on the separation of Church and State removed the privileged status of the state religion (Catholic Church) and of the three other state-recognised religions (Lutheranism, Calvinism, Judaism), but left to them the use without fee, and the maintenance at government expense, of the churches that they used prior to 1905.

A notable exception is Alsace-Lorraine, which at the time of the separation was part of Germany, and where the pre-1905 status, including the concordat, is still in force. This was negotiated in 1918 when Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France at the end of the first World War, and approved by both France and the Holy See with the Briand-Ceretti Agreement. As a consequence, and although France is one of the countries in the world where the state and church are most separated, the French head of state is paradoxically the only temporal power in the world still nominating Catholic bishops, namely the bishop of Metz and the archbishop of Strasbourg. They are approved by the Pope and in practice selected by him, but formally nominated by the French president following diplomatic exchanges with the Holy See through the nunciature.

During the application of the 1905 law, prime minister Emile Combes, a member of the Radical-Socialist Party, tried to strictly enforce measures which some Catholics considered humiliating or blasphematory, leading to clashes between the &quot;&quot; and the authorities. Anti-clericalism slowly declined among the French left-wing throughout France in the twentieth century, while the question of religion and of freedom of thought seemed to have been resolved. However, it is still present as a defining trait of the left-wing, while most right-wing Frenchmen describe themselves as Catholics (although not necessarily practicing). Thus, the draft laws presented by François Mitterrand&#x27;s government in the early 1980s, concerning restrictions on the state funding of private (and in majority Catholic) schools, were countered by right-wing demonstrations headed by the then mayor of Paris, the Gaullist Jacques Chirac, who was to be his prime minister in 1986 and would succeed him in 1995 as president. In the same way, the 2004 law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools, revived the controversy twenty years later, although the dividing lines also passed through each political side due to the complexity of the subject. On this occasion, several Muslim associations have allied themselves with conservative Catholics to reject the law. One consequences of the law was that some Muslim middle and high school students who refused to remove their veils or &quot;conspicuous religious symbols&quot; withdrew from the public school system in favour of the private, but publicly funded, Catholic schools (where the law does not apply, being restricted to the public education system).

In any case, since the 1905 law on the separation of the Church and State, the prevailing public doctrine on religion is &quot;laïcité&quot; – that is, neutrality of the state with respect to religious doctrine, and separation of the religious and the public spheres, except in Alsace-Lorraine and in some oversea territories. This state neutrality is conceived as a protection of religious minorities as well as the upholding of freedom of thought, which includes a right to agnosticism and atheism. Although many Catholics were at first opposed to this secular movement, most of them have since changed opinions, finding that this neutrality actually protects their faith from political interference. Only some minority traditionalist Catholic groups, such as the Society of St. Pius X, push for the return to the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; or at least pre-separation situation, contending that France has forgotten its divine mission as a Christian country (an argument already upheld by the Ultras presenting the 1825 Anti-Sacrilege Act).

=== Statistics ===
2006 Statistics from the Catholic Church in France:


74% of French Catholics support same-sex marriage and 24% oppose it. 87% of French Catholics believe society should accept homosexuality, while 10% believe society should not accept homosexuality.

==Politics==
Growing discontent with the Catholic Church&#x27;s influence in education and politics led to a series of reforms during the Third Republic reducing this influence, under the protests of the Ultramontanists who supported the Vatican&#x27;s influence.

Anti-clericalism was popular among Republicans, Radicals, and Socialists, in part because the Church had supported the counterrevolutionaries throughout the 19th century. After the 16 May 1877 crisis and the fall of the &quot;Ordre Moral&quot; government led by Marshall MacMahon, the Republicans voted Jules Ferry&#x27;s 1880 laws on free education (1881) and mandatory and secular education (1882), which Catholics felt was a gross violation of their rights. 
The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State established state secularism in France and led to the closure of most Church-run schools.

Since the Fifth Republic, most Catholics in France have supported the Gaullist and Centrist Christian democratic parties.

=== Ownership and condition of Catholic churches in France ===

The government owns approximately 95% of France&#x27;s more than 42,000 Catholic churches. This includes all parish churches constructed before 1905, which are owned by France&#x27;s 34,955 communes. Only nine of the country&#x27;s 149 cathedrals are not publicly owned.

The condition of these buildings varies significantly. According to the November 2024 edition of a survey by the Bishops&#x27; Conference of France, 72 churches have been demolished since 2000, and 326 have been deconsecrated since 1905. The restoration efforts following the 2019 fire at Notre Dame Cathedral have focused on the financial challenges of maintaining and restoring these historical structures, particularly the smaller churches.

* The archbishops of these archdioceses are not metropolitan bishops and thus do not wear the pallium. These are some of the few instances in the Latin Church where this phenomenon occurs.
* This is a territorial prelature, not a diocese.

<doc id="563569" wikidata="Q885038" url="?curid=563569" title="Blondie (1938 film)">
<text>Blondie is a 1938 American comedy film directed by Frank Strayer, based on the comic strip of the same name, created by Chic Young. The screenplay was written by Richard Flournoy. 
The plot involves the Bumsteads&#x27; fifth anniversary, Dagwood trying to get a raise, and Blondie trying to buy new furniture.

This was the first of 28 films based on the comic strip; Columbia Pictures produced them from 1938 to 1943, and popular demand brought them back in 1945. When the &quot;Blondie&quot; film series came to an end with &quot;Beware of Blondie&quot; in 1950, it was announced as being replaced with a series of &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; movies. However, only two such films were made, &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; (1951) and &quot;Corky of Gasoline Alley&quot; (1951). Columbia then reissued the &quot;Blondie&quot; features, beginning with the first film in the series.

Columbia used the series to showcase many of its contract players. Rita Hayworth was featured in &quot;Blondie on a Budget&quot;; Glenn Ford in &quot;Blondie Plays Cupid&quot;, Larry Parks and Janet Blair in &quot;Blondie Goes to College&quot;, Shemp Howard in &quot;Blondie Knows Best&quot;, and Adele Jergens in &quot;Blondie&#x27;s Anniversary&quot;. Other roles were taken by Columbia contractees Doris Houck, Bruce Bennett, Lloyd Bridges, Ann Doran, Stanley Brown, Richard Fiske, Bud Jamison, Eddie Laughton, John Tyrrell, Alyn Lockwood, Jimmy Lloyd, Gay Nelson, and Ross Ford.

==Plot summary==
Dagwood Bumstead is a good-natured but scatterbrained young salesman at the Dithers Construction company office, with a wife, young son, and dog. He often arrives at work barely on time, after clumsily colliding on foot with the mail carrier.

In this pilot episode, Blondie secretly orders new furniture on credit for their anniversary, not realizing Dagwood is broke because he had helped out a needy friend. Mr. Dithers sends Dagwood to a hotel with orders to have a guest there, Mr. Hazlip, sign a valuable construction contract, but the reluctant Hazlip has the hotel clerk tell Dagwood he is not in.

While lounging on a lobby couch, Dagwood and another gentleman notice that the hotel&#x27;s vacuum cleaner is broken, and they sneak it into the other man&#x27;s room where the two of them bond while wasting hours, for fun, trying to repair it, although it&#x27;s none of their business.

Blondie phones and mistakenly thinks the man&#x27;s daughter, whom she&#x27;s never met, is Dagwood&#x27;s paramour, and asks for a divorce. Meanwhile, Blondie&#x27;s parents and amorous ex-boyfriend visit her, and the new furniture is repossessed by movers in front of their eyes.

Dagwood, though unlicensed, borrows the parents&#x27; car without permission, and collides with a policeman, who notices the stolen vacuum cleaner in it bearing the hotel&#x27;s name. In court, Blondie pleads with the judge not to jail her husband. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, the vacuum cleaner gentleman is revealed as the valuable client Mr. Hazlip whom Dagwood had been trying to contact. He willingly signs the Dithers contract, and Blondie negotiates a raise and promotion for Dagwood.

<text>New Zealand Naval Forces was the name given to a division of the Royal Navy. The division was formed in 1913 and it operated under this name until 1921, when it became the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy.

==History==

Originally the British Royal Navy provided total security for the colony of New Zealand, but in 1846 the settlers bought a gunboat. The Waikato Flotilla operated from 1860, and at the same time a Naval Artillery Volunteer corps was established to provide harbour defence. In 1884 the government purchased four spar torpedo boats, and starting in 1887 it funded ships of the Australasian Auxiliary Squadron.

Before establishment of the navy, the people of New Zealand paid for the building of the battlecruiser HMS &quot;New Zealand&quot;, which was at the Battle of Jutland.

In 1912 the then New Zealand Minister of Defence, James Allen, argued in London for the creation of a New Zealand division of the Royal Navy. Though this was opposed by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, the Naval Defence Act of 1913 brought the division into existence. The Naval Defence Act authorised the Government to establish a naval force organisation which would pass to the control of the Admiralty in the event of war. The division was to be funded by the New Zealand government.

The light cruiser HMS &quot;Philomel&quot; was purchased from the Royal Navy to function as a training ship. In 1913 it became the first boat to be commissioned, under the command of Percival Hall-Thompson, into the New Zealand navy. &quot;Philomel&quot; escorted New Zealand land forces to occupy the German colony of Samoa in 1914 and saw further action under the command of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf.

In 1919 Commodore, Alan Hotham was appointed commander-in-chief until 1921 when the New Zealand Naval Forces was renamed as the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy.

<text>P.O.T. was a Filipino rock band, formed in 1994 and officially disbanded in 2005. The band was fronted by Karl Roy who also fronted the bands Advent Call and Kapatid. The group is famous for their 1997 remake of the song &quot;Yugyugan Na&quot;, originally performed by The Advisors in 1977. The band held a reunion concert on July 22, 2006, at The 70&#x27;s Bistro in Quezon City. On 1997, Harley Alarcon left the band and was replaced by Jay Alviar who also left a year later. In 1999, Ian Umali left the band to go back to school and continue his studies.

In February 2005, EMI Philippines released a repackaged version of the first (and only) P.O.T. album. with an additional bonus tracks a new version of the song Ulitin&quot;, “Piece of This&quot;, and “Panaginip&quot;, as well as a brand new song.

The initials of the band name P.O.T. is a pseudo-acronym, meaning it doesn&#x27;t stand for anything at all or as what Karl Roy stated in an interview, fans of the band can freely decide in making up any meanings that fit the initials.

In the early morning of March 13, 2012, Karl Roy died due to cardiac arrest.

==Return==

P.O.T. performed again for the first time in almost 16 years on June 25, 2022, at The 70&#x27;s Bistro with original members Paraguya and Umali, Red Dela Peña of Ojo Rojo (Red Eye) filling in for vocals, and Reli de Vera on drums. The band is slated for another concert on July 16, 2022, at 19 East in Parañaque City.

<doc id="563579" wikidata="Q1075851" url="?curid=563579" title="Choking Victim">
<text>Choking Victim was an American punk band formed in New York City, which lasted from 1992 to 1998. They played a mix of hardcore punk and ska (sometimes known as ska-core). Following the breakup of the band, which occurred the same day as the recording of their only studio album &quot;No Gods, No Managers&quot;, members went on to form Leftöver Crack and INDK, among others.

==Background==
The band became well-known at the C-Squat in the Lower East Side of Manhattan for their innovative music and politically charged lyrics. They also became infamous for their Satanic imagery and references to the vagrant lifestyle, including smoking both crack cocaine and marijuana, shoplifting, and squatting. The band prides itself on its atheism, and makes frequent references to Satan. On the album &quot;No Gods, No Managers&quot;, they use excerpts from the lectures of political scientist Michael Parenti.

=== Breakup ===
Choking Victim broke up after the first day of recording for their first full-length LP, &quot;No Gods, No Managers&quot;, but the recordings from that one day were enough to make a full album. After they broke up, Stza formed the band Leftöver Crack, and Skwert and Ezra formed INDK. Ezra joined Leftover Crack in 2001. Skwert is currently the front man for the New Jersey–based ska punk band Public Serpents. Sascha has spent the last several years organically farming in upstate New York, and is a founding member of Icarus Project, a radical mental health network.

=== Reunions ===
On November 11, 2000, Choking Victim reunited to play a show in Tompkins Square Park with the lineup from their album, substituting former bassist Alec for Shayne. Later, in late 2005, Choking Victim reunited a second time, performing four shows. On June 11, 2006, they played a show at the Lower East Side&#x27;s Tompkins Square Park, which featured various political speakers, including members of the Mislead Youth Project. At the end of July 2006, they toured the Dominican Republic, before Leftöver Crack embarked on their European Tour.

In the Summer of 2012, lead singer Stza enlisted the help of Irish Ska/Punk band Chewing on Tinfoil and formed &quot;The Choking Victim Show&quot;. This band, playing the songs of Choking Victim, toured throughout the UK, Ireland and France.

Choking Victim has continued to play sporadic concerts worldwide between 2014 and 2017. Prior to 2017 these were one-off events, but, in 2017, they undertook their first tour in over a decade.

=== Legacy ===
In addition to Leftöver Crack and INDK, Choking Victim also spawned Public Serpents, Morning Glory and the Crack Rock Steady 7. Choking Victim have reformed for a few dates in the UK and Europe as The Choking Victim Show with Stza, Sascha, Alec and Ezra.

<text>A hormone receptor is a receptor molecule that binds to a specific hormone. Hormone receptors are a wide family of proteins made up of receptors for thyroid and steroid hormones, retinoids and Vitamin D, and a variety of other receptors for various ligands, such as fatty acids and prostaglandins. Hormone receptors are of mainly two classes. Receptors for peptide hormones tend to be cell surface receptors built into the plasma membrane of cells and are thus referred to as trans membrane receptors. An example of this is Actrapid. Receptors for steroid hormones are usually found within the protoplasm and are referred to as intracellular or nuclear receptors, such as testosterone. Upon hormone binding, the receptor can initiate multiple signaling pathways, which ultimately leads to changes in the behavior of the target cells.

Hormonal therapy and hormone receptors play a very large part in breast cancer treatment (therapy is not limited to only breast cancer). By influencing the hormones, the cells&#x27; growth can be changed along with its function. These hormones can cause cancer to not survive in the human body.

== General ligand binding ==

Hormone receptor proteins bind to a hormone as a result of an accumulation of weak interactions. Because of the relatively large size of enzymes and receptors, the large amount of surface area provides the basis for these weak interactions to occur. This binding is actually highly specific because of the complementarity of these interactions between polar, non-polar, charged, neutral, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic residues. Upon binding, the receptor often undergoes a conformational change and may bind further, signaling ligands to activate a signaling pathway. Because of these highly specific and high affinity interactions between hormones and their receptors, very low concentrations of hormone can produce significant cellular response. Receptors can have various different structures depending on the function of the hormone and the structure of its ligand. Therefore, hormone binding to its receptor is a complex process that can be mediated by cooperative binding, reversible and irreversible interactions, and multiple binding sites.

== Functions ==

=== Transmission of signal ===
The presence of hormone or multiple hormones enables a response in the receptor, which begins a cascade of signaling. The hormone receptor interacts with different molecules to induce a variety of changes, such as an increase or decrease of nutrient sources, growth, and other metabolic functions. These signaling pathways are complex mechanisms mediated by feedback loops where different signals activate and inhibit other signals. If a signaling pathway ends with the increase in production of a nutrient, that nutrient is then a signal back to the receptor that acts as a competitive inhibitor to prevent further production. Signaling pathways regulate cells through activating or inactivating gene expression, transport of metabolites, and controlling enzymatic activity to manage growth and functions of metabolism.

==== Intracellular receptors ====
Intracellular and nuclear receptors are a direct way for the cell to respond to internal changes and signals. Intracellular receptors are activated by hydrophobic ligands that pass through the cellular membrane. All nuclear receptors are very similar in structure, and are described with intrinsic transcriptional activity. Intrinsic transcriptional involves the three following domains: transcription-activating, DNA-binding, and ligand-binding. These domains and ligands are hydrophobic and are able to travel through the membrane. The movement of macromolecules and ligand molecules into the cell enables a complex transport system of intracellular signal transfers through different cellular environments until response is enabled. Nuclear receptors are a special class of intracellular receptor that specifically aid the needs of the cell to express certain genes. Nuclear receptors often bind directly to DNA by targeting specific DNA sequences in order to express or repress transcription of nearby genes.

==== Cell surface receptors ====
The extracellular environment is able to induce changes within the cell. Hormones, or other extracellular signals, are able to induce changes within the cell by binding to cell surface receptors also known as transmembrane receptors. This interaction allows the hormone receptor to produce second messengers within the cell to aid response. Second messengers may also be sent to interact with intracellular receptors in order to enter the complex signal transport system that eventually changes cellular function.

G-protein-coupled membrane receptors (GPCR) are a major class of transmembrane receptors. The features of G proteins include GDP/GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis and guanosine nucleotide exchange. When a ligand binds to a GPCR the receptor changes conformation, which makes the intracellular loops between the different membrane domains of the receptor interact with G proteins. This interaction causes the exchange of GDP for GTP, which triggers structural changes within the alpha subunit of the G protein. The changes interrupts the interaction of the alpha subunit with the beta–gamma complex and which results in a single alpha subunit with GTP bound and a beta–gamma dimer. The GTP–alpha monomer interacts with a variety of cellular targets. The beta–gamma dimer also can stimulate enzymes within the cells for example, adenylate cyclase but it does not have as many targets as the GTP–alpha complex.

=== Aiding gene expression ===
Hormone receptors can behave as transcription factors by interacting directly with DNA or by cross-talking with signaling pathways. This process is mediated through co-regulators. In the absence of ligand, receptor molecules bind corepressors to repress gene expression, compacting chromatin through histone deacetylatase. When a ligand is present, nuclear receptors undergo a conformational change to recruit various coactivators. These molecules work to remodel chromatin. Hormone receptors have highly specific motifs that can interact with coregulator complexes. This is the mechanism through which receptors can induce regulation of gene expression depending on both the extracellular environment and the immediate cellular composition. Steroid hormones and their regulation by receptors are the most potent molecule interactions in aiding gene expression.

Problems with nuclear receptor binding as a result of shortages of ligand or receptors can have drastic effects on the cell. The dependency on the ligand is the most important part in being able to regulate gene expression, so the absence of ligand is drastic to this process. For example, estrogen deficiency is a cause of osteoporosis and the inability to undergo a proper signaling cascade prevents bone growth and strengthening. Deficiencies in nuclear receptor-mediated pathways play a key role in the development of disease, like osteoporosis.

when a ligand binds to a nuclear receptor, the receptor undergoes a conformational change that causes it to become activated, which in turn affects how much gene expression is regulated.

== Classification ==

=== Receptors for water-soluble hormones ===
Water-soluble hormones include glycoproteins, catecholamines, and peptide hormones composed of polypeptides, e.g. thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and insulin. These molecules are not lipid-soluble and therefore cannot diffuse through cell membranes. Consequently, receptors for peptide hormones are located on the plasma membrane because they have bound to a receptor protein located on the plasma membrane.

Water-soluble hormones come from amino acids and are located and stored in endocrine cells until actually needed.

The main two types of transmembrane receptor hormone receptor are the G-protein-coupled receptors and the enzyme-linked receptors. These receptors generally function via intracellular second messengers, including cyclic AMP (cAMP), cyclic GMP (cGMP), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the calcium (Ca2+)-calmodulin system.

===Receptors for lipid-soluble hormones===

Steroid hormone receptors and related receptors are generally soluble proteins that function through gene activation. Lipid-soluble hormones target specific sequences of DNA by diffusing into the cell. When they have diffused into the cell, they bind to receptors (intracellular), and migrate into the nucleus. Their response elements are DNA sequences (promoters) that are bound by the complex of the steroid bound to its receptor. The receptors themselves are zinc-finger proteins. These receptors include those for glucocorticoids (glucocorticoid receptors), estrogens (estrogen receptors), androgens (androgen receptors), thyroid hormone (T3) (thyroid hormone receptors), calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) (calcitriol receptors), and the retinoids (vitamin A) (retinoid receptors). Receptor-protein interactions induce the uptake and destruction of their respective hormones in order to regulate their concentration in the body. This is especially important for steroid hormones because many body systems are entirely steroid dependent.

== List of hormone receptors ==
For some of these classes, in any given species (such as, for example, humans), there is a single molecule encoded by a single gene; in other cases, there are several molecules in the class.

* Androgen receptors
* Calcitriol receptors
* Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1
* Corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2
* Estrogen receptors
* Follicle-stimulating hormone receptors
* Glucagon receptors
* Gonadotropin receptors
* Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors
* Growth hormone receptors
*Insulin receptor
* Luteinizing hormone
* Progesterone receptors
* Retinoid receptors
* Somatostatin receptors
* Thyroid hormone receptors
* Thyrotropin receptors

<text>S Club 8 (originally S Club Juniors) were a spin off of the British pop group S Club 7. The children were all in their early teens or younger when they were chosen from thousands of hopefuls on the television series &quot;S Club Search&quot; to appear as a support act for pop band S Club 7.
S Club Juniors were originally intended only as a support act at Wembley Arena for the S Club Carnival Tour but were deemed so successful that they went on to support S Club 7 throughout every British date of the tour. They later released their own debut single, &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, followed by other singles &quot;Automatic High&quot;, &quot;New Direction&quot; and &quot;Puppy Love/Sleigh Ride&quot;. This was followed by their debut album, &quot;Together&quot;.

After changing the group name to S Club 8, they released the singles &quot;Fool No More&quot;, &quot;Sundown&quot; and a remixed version of their album track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me You&#x27;re Sorry&quot;. They then released a second album, &quot;Sundown&quot;.

The group appreared in their own TV Show, &quot;I Dream&quot;, alongside other young actors including Lorna Want, who had originally auditioned for S Club Juniors herself. The show spawned a soundtrack and third album for S Club 8, called &quot;Welcome to Avalon Heights&quot;. It peaked at number 133 in the UK album charts. It did not chart in any other countries.

A documentary series titled &quot;S Club Juniors: The Story&quot; was produced about the early days of the group.

S Club 8 disbanded in 2005, after almost four years.

==History==
===2001–2002: Formation and &quot;Together&quot;===

S Club Juniors was formed in 2001 through a CBBC reality television show, S Club Search, and originally was supposed to consist of seven members, like the pop group the Juniors’ were inspired by, S Club 7. Thousands of children turned up and were whittled down in several rounds. Notable people who also auditioned for &quot;S Club Search&quot; included Rylan Clark and Lorna Want. The children who made the final round met S Club 7, who helped judge. The first seven members chosen were Calvin Goldspink, Daisy Evans, Stacey McClean, Rochelle Wiseman, Francesca Sandford, Jay Asforis, and Connor Daley. All were aged 12.

The producers of the show and S Club 7 discussed two other candidates who had impressed them: 13-year-old Aaron Renfree and 10-year-old Hannah Richings. It was decided to make S Club Juniors a nine member group. In early rehearsals, Daley was removed from the group.

S Club Juniors&#x27; appearances were considered a success by 19 Entertainment, the management company that had created S Club 7 and auditioned S Club Juniors. Consequently, it was decided they should perform as a support act at all of the venues on the tour. The juniors made their first television appearance on &quot;Children in Need&quot; on 16 November 2001. By the end of the tour, S Club Juniors had created a following and Polydor Records signed the group. Their first single was called &quot;One Step Closer&quot;. It was promoted by the TV series &quot;S Club Junior: The Story&quot;, and released in the UK on 22 April 2002, staying in the UK top 75 for 11 weeks.

The group began working on their first album in June 2002. A video for the second single, &quot;Automatic High&quot;, was filmed in Spain, while S Club 7 began their fourth TV series. Released on 22 July 2002, the single reached number 2 in the UK charts. The third single, &quot;New Direction&quot;, was released on 10 October and also reached number 2. The Juniors released their debut album &quot;Together&quot; on 21 October reaching number 5. Their fourth single, &quot;Puppy Love/Sleigh Ride&quot;, was released on 9 December 2002. The single debuted at number 6 in the UK charts. The song was also used in the 2003 film &quot;Love Actually&quot;.

===2003–2023: &quot;Sundown&quot;, &quot;I Dream&quot;, split, Instagram live series===

The group joined the S Club United tour in April 2003, billed as S Club 8, releasing a fifth single, &quot;Fool No More&quot;, on 30 June. It reached number 4 in the UK chart. A second single, &quot;Sundown&quot;, was released in the UK on 29 September 2003 reaching number 4 in the UK. The album, &quot;Sundown&quot;, was released on 13 October 2003 and reached number 13. The record company perceived the album as a failure. In a review for BBC Music, Jack Smith stated that some of &quot;Sundown&quot;″s tracks, &quot;come across as brattier, livelier, younger relatives of... S Club(&#x27;s)&quot;, and that &quot;the album only really flags when the &#x27;8 attempt to do more grown-up songs&quot;. The third single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me You&#x27;re Sorry&quot;, was released on 29 December 2003 in the UK where it reached number 11.

After this, the band turned to acting and were cast in the show, &quot;I Dream&quot; which portrayed S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. Despite the show being tailored around them, every member of S Club 8 still had to audition. &quot;I Dream&quot; revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by Christopher Lloyd of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; fame), where the characters tried to improve their talents in the performing arts. On 15 November 2004, the show&#x27;s theme tune &quot;Dreaming&quot; was released as a single, sung by members Sandford and Goldspink. The single charted at number 19. On 29 November 2004 an album titled &quot;Welcome to Avalon Heights&quot; was released, containing songs from the show performed by S Club 8 members and the rest of the cast. The album debuted at number 133. The group disbanded in 2005.

In 2020, during the Covid-19 lockdown, member Asforis (now Perry) held an Instagram live series, interviewing the other seven members in turn over the course of seven weeks.

In 2023, when S Club 7 reunited for &quot;The Good Times tour&quot;, many fans asked if S Club 8 would also be reuniting. Members Franks and Renfree held an Instagram Live Q&amp;A to confirm that S Club 8 had not been asked to reunite for the tour. Both Franks and Renfree encouraged fans to “make some noise” in support, to encourage a paid opportunity for a professional reunion. A petition was started shortly after, aiming for an initial 500 signatures. As of 2025, it has garnered 324 signatures.
==Members==
* (born 30 October 1989, years old) did not appear at the S Club Juniors auditions, instead sending a video tape of himself to S Club 7 who allowed him through to the final auditions. He trained at The Susi Earnshaw Theatre School and attended Roding Valley High School. From March 2018, Asforis starred as the leading role of Berry Gordy in the West End production of &quot;&quot; in Shaftesbury Theatre, London. As of November 2019, Asforis can be seen as understudy for the roles of Alexander Hamilton and Marquis de Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson in Hamilton at the Victoria Palace Theatre. In 2023, Asforis joined the cast of Back to the Future: The Musical as Mayor Goldie Wilson. Asforis is openly gay, and has talked about struggling with his sexuality while in S Club 8. Since leaving the band, Asforis now goes by the name Jay Perry professionally; Perry is his middle name.
* (born 30 November 1989, years old): From early 2007, Evans was a member of five-piece female group, From Above. After touring the UK and a series of line-up changes, in September 2008 they were signed by Beyoncé&#x27;s father Mathew Knowles and Music World Records. The group moved to America to work on their debut album, documented on the MTV reality show, Breaking From Above. A music video for debut &quot;Not The Same Girl&quot; was released on 2 December 2011. The single and the album, &quot;Breaking From Above&quot; was released on 12 December. They then arrived for the &quot;Boot camp&quot; stages for &quot;The X Factor&quot;, but were rejected. In 2013 Evans became engaged to footballer Jonjo Shelvey. They went on to marry in June 2015. The couple&#x27;s first daughter arrived on 4 March 2014. Evans gave birth to the couple&#x27;s second daughter, on 31 May 2016. In July 2020 during an Instagram live with bandmate Asforis, Evans announced she was expecting her third child, a boy later that year. Her son was born on 4 November 2020. Evans now works as a make-up artist, under her married name, Daisy Shelvey.

<text>Louis Orth Kelso (; December 4, 1913 – February 17, 1991) was a political economist, corporate and financial lawyer, author, lecturer and merchant banker who is chiefly remembered today as the inventor and pioneer of the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), invented to enable working people without savings to buy stock in their employer company and pay for it out of its future dividend yield.

==Biography==
He was born on December 4, 1913, in Denver, Colorado.

Kelso began to think seriously about economics in 1931, during the Great Depression. He was determined to launch his own investigation into the cause of a phenomenon no one was able to explain to his satisfaction.

This quest took him to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where in 1937 he was graduated with a B.S. degree in business administration and finance; he went on to law school in Boulder, receiving a J.D. in 1938. He then joined a Denver law firm, Pershing, Bosworth, Dick &amp; Dawson from 1938 to 1942.

Then came Pearl Harbor. Kelso was commissioned in the U.S. Naval Service, and assigned to intelligence duty first in San Francisco and then in the Canal Zone. Working tropical hours, Kelso used his free afternoons to work on his seminal manuscript, &quot;The Fallacy of Full Employment&quot;. With the war over, the completed manuscript in his footlocker, the Navy sent him back to civilian life in 1946. But 1946 was also the year the Congress passed the Full Employment Act. This legislation, still in force, defines economic policy in the United States 170 years after the official birth of the Industrial Revolution as the right to a job. Kelso concluded that the time for his ideas had not yet come.

He then taught constitutional law at University of Colorado at Boulder. He then moved to San Francisco, California. There he became a law partner with Kelso, Cotton, Seligman &amp; Ray.

He died on February 17, 1991, at the Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, California.

==Development of ESOPs==

Kelso created the ESOP in 1956 to enable the employees of a closely held newspaper chain to buy out its retiring owners. Two years later Kelso and his co-author, the philosopher Mortimer J. Adler, explained the macro-economic theory on which the ESOP is based in &quot;The Capitalist Manifesto&quot; (Random House, 1958). In &quot;The New Capitalists&quot; (Random House, 1961), the two authors present Kelso&#x27;s financial tools for democratizing capital ownership in a private property, market economy. These ideas were further elaborated and refined in &quot;Two-Factor Theory: The Economics of Reality&quot; (Random House, 1967) and &quot;Democracy and Economic Power: Extending the ESOP Revolution Through Binary Economics&quot; (1986, Ballinger Publishing Company, Cambridge, Massachusetts; reprinted 1991, University Press of America, Lanham, Maryland), both co-authored by Patricia Hetter Kelso, his collaborator since 1963.

Kelso&#x27;s next financing innovation, the Consumer Stock Ownership Plan (CSOP), in 1958 enabled a consortium of farmers in the Central Valley to finance and start up an anhydrous ammonia fertilizer plant. Despite fierce opposition from the major oil companies who dominated the industry, Valley Nitrogen Producers was a resounding success. Substantial dividends first paid for the stock and then drastically reduced fertilizer costs for the farmer-shareholders.

Kelso regarded the ESOP and CSOP as pragmatic proof that his revolutionary revision of classical economic theory, and the financial techniques he derived from this new perspective, were sound and workable in the economic and business world. Kelso gained that worldly knowledge from his work as a corporate and financial lawyer, and later as senior partner in the law firm he founded. He was further motivated by his conviction that lawyers had a special responsibility to maintain and improve society&#x27;s institutions in the light of its democratic values. He further believed that the business corporation was society&#x27;s greatest social invention and that its executives had a fiduciary responsibility in exercising its vast power.

Kelso long believed that he had not originated a new economic theory but only discovered a vital fact that the classical economists had somehow overlooked. This fact was the key to understanding why the private property, free market economy was notoriously unstable, pursuing a roller coaster course of exhilarating highs and terrifying descents into economic and financial collapse.

This missing fact, which Kelso had uncovered over years of intensive reading, research and thought, drastically modifies the classical paradigm which has dominated formal economics since Adam Smith. It concerns the effect of technological change on the distributive dynamics of a private property, free market economy. Technological change, Kelso concluded, makes tools, machines, structures and processes ever more productive while leaving human productivity largely unchanged. The result is that primary distribution through the free market economy (whose distributive principle is &quot;to each according to his production&quot;) delivers progressively more market-sourced income to capital owners and progressively less to workers who make their contributions through labor.

Differential productiveness over time concentrates market-sourced income in the hands of those who will not recycle it back through the market as payment for consumer goods and services. They already have most of what they want and need, so they invest their excess in new productive power. This is the source of the distributional bottleneck which makes the private property, free market economy ever more dysfunctional. The symptoms of dysfunction are capital concentration and inadequate consumer demand, the effects of which translate into poverty and economic insecurity for the majority of people who depend entirely on wage income and cannot survive more than a week or two without a paycheck. And since, as Adam Smith laid down, economic demand begins with the consumer and consumer purchasing power, the production side of the economy is under-nourished and hobbled.

All of Kelso&#x27;s financing tools and economic proposals are designed to correct the imbalance between production and consumption &quot;at its source&quot;, in conformity with the private property/free market principles identified by Smith and his followers.

In a biographical summary written for the National Center for Employee Ownership in 1988, Kelso described &quot;the area in which first I alone, and then, beginning about 25 years ago, Patricia and I, have made our contribution to the world of economics and corporate (and other) finance. The Kelso contribution lies partly in the area of macro-economic discovery, and partly in practical ways to implement and make good use of those discoveries in human affairs.&quot;

Although going along with Random House&#x27;s cold-war title, &quot;The Capitalist Manifesto&quot;, Kelso and Adler believed that &quot;capitalist&quot; was not the right term. But they could not come up with a better one. In their book they had called Kelso&#x27;s new concept the theory of capitalism. Later Kelso and Hetter, wrestling with the same semantic problem, came up with the term &quot;universal capitalism&quot;. Not until after their last book was already in print did Kelso discover the term they had been searching for all along: &quot;binary economics&quot;.

==Kelso &amp; Company==
In 1971, Louis Kelso founded Kelso Bangert &amp; Company as a merchant bank that would be both an advisor and investor in mergers and acquisitions involving employee stock ownership plans. The firm, which would later come to be known as Kelso &amp; Company, would transition toward private equity investments in the late 1970s and would raise its first private equity fund in 1980. Today Kelso &amp; Company is a $10 billion private equity firm and was among the 50 largest private equity firms globally.

<text>The Meridian Gate or Wumen (; Manchu: ; Möllendorff: &quot;julergi dulimbai duka&quot;) is the southern and largest gate of the Forbidden City in Beijing, China. Unlike the other gates of the Forbidden City, the Meridian Gate has two protruding arms on either side, derived from ancient que towers traditionally used to decorate the main entrances of palaces, temples and tombs. The gate has five arches. The three central arches are close together in the main, central section; the two flanking arches are farther apart from the three central arches, and are located between the central section and the protruding arms. The centre arch was formerly reserved for the Emperor alone; the exceptions were the Empress, who could enter it once on the day of her wedding, and the top three scholars of the triennial civil service examinations, who left the exams through the central arch. All other officials and servants had to use the four side arches.

A series of buildings form the superstructure of the gate. The central one is a pavilion of nine bays wide, with double eaves. On each of the protruding side, a 13 bays-long building with a single eave, connects the two pyramidal-roofed pavilions that represented the que towers.

Its superstructure is also called the &quot;Five Phoenix Turrets&quot; because it is composed of five buildings. Imperial proclamations and almanacs were issued from the gate house. After successful campaigns, the Emperor received prisoners of war here, sometimes followed by mass decapitations.

Although urban myth has it that senior officers were executed here in Imperial China; in reality only corporal punishment was actually carried out.

Behind the viewer is Upright Gate, the principal entrance to the imperial palace grounds.

When proceeding northward through the palace grounds, the next major gate encountered is the Gate of Supreme Harmony.

<doc id="563606" wikidata="Q2249342" url="?curid=563606" title="Welsh football league system">
<text>The Welsh football league system (or pyramid) is a series of football leagues with regular promotion and relegation between them.

It consists of four main tiers, as well as lower local leagues.

While most Welsh clubs play in the Welsh pyramid and most clubs in that pyramid are Welsh, five Welsh clubs play in English leagues, and four English clubs play in Welsh leagues.

==Structure of Welsh football==

===Tier 1: Cymru Premier===

At the top is the Cymru Premier, which is the only national league in Wales and is run by the Football Association of Wales.

===Tier 2: Cymru North and Cymru South===

Since 2019–20, the Football Association of Wales runs the second tier for the first time after a review of the Welsh league pyramid. Tier 2 is split into a north and central Wales league, Cymru North, and a corresponding league for south Wales, Cymru South. The champions of each of these leagues can be promoted to the Cymru Premier, subject to acceptable ground facilities, and if the champions cannot meet the criteria the runner-up team may be considered.

The Cymru North replaced the Cymru Alliance whilst the Cymru South incorporated most of the clubs of the then-highest division of the Welsh Football League.

===Tier 3: Ardal Leagues===
Since the 2020–21 season, the Football Association of Wales has run the third tier after a review of the Welsh league pyramid. Tier 3, called the Ardal Leagues is split into a Northern and Southern League, with each league divided into two regionally based divisions, giving North East, North West, South East and South West leagues, each consisting of a maximum of 16 clubs. In an attempt to avoid dividing the current Mid-Wales teams across all four leagues, the North-East league contains a large contingent of the Mid-Wales teams. The North-West league contains the sides near the North Wales coast. To be eligible to join the league, clubs need to meet the criteria for FAW tier 3 certification.

The Ardal Leagues structure replaces the former tier 3 leagues: Welsh Football League Division One, Mid Wales Football League Division One, Welsh Alliance League Division 1 and the Welsh National League Premier Division, leagues based in South Wales, Mid Wales, North West Wales and North East Wales respectively.

There are three relegated clubs from each of the tier 3 leagues at the end of each season.

===Tier 4: Area leagues===
Below this are six local tier 4 leagues, each run by one of the area associations of Welsh football:

*Central Wales League (run by Central Wales Football Association)
*North East Wales Football League Premier Division (run by North East Wales Football Association)
*North Wales Coast East Football League Premier Division and North Wales Coast West Football League Premier Division (run by North Wales Coast Football Association)
*Gwent County League Premier Division (run by Gwent County Football Association)
*West Wales Premier League (run by the West Wales Football Association)
*South Wales Alliance League Premier Division (run by South Wales Football Association) 

The winners of each league are eligible for promotion to the Ardal Leagues subject to meeting FAW tier 3 certification. In the event that winners do not meet the criteria, the runner-up is also eligible for promotion, again subject to meeting the same tier 3 certification requirements.

===Lower tier leagues===
====North Wales====
Below the North Wales Coast East and West there are Division One leagues at tier 5 and North East Wales Football League has a championship division, also at tier 5.

====Central Wales====
In this area there are three leagues at tier 5 - the Ceredigion League, the Montgomeryshire League, and the Aberystwyth League. These offer promotion to the tier 4 Mid Wales League East and West divisions.

====South Wales====
Local leagues are affiliated to Gwent County FA, South Wales FA, and West Wales FA respectively, with promotion up the pyramid possible.

In the Gwent County FA Area, clubs from the Newport and District, East Gwent, Gwent Central and North Gwent leagues have a promotion pathway to Division Two of the Gwent County League (tier 6). Champions (or runners-up) of these leagues are eligible for promotion if they satisfy FAW criteria. 

The South Wales Alliance League offers a promotion pathway to leagues affiliated to the South Wales Football Association. Champions of local leagues in the towns and cities of South Wales play off to be promoted into the South Wales Alliance Division Two (tier 6), subject to meeting licensing requirements.

The West Wales FA area has had its own Premier League since its creation in 2020, having previously having been the only FA area to not have one. Promotion to this tier 4 league is possible from the champions of the Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea Senior and Neath &amp; District Leagues, subject to meeting FAW licensing requirements. The top divisions of each of these leagues are at tier 5.

==Current system (until 2025-26)==

From the 2023-24 season, the following structure will follow. For each division, its official name and number of clubs is given:

==New system (From 2026-27 onwards)==

From the 2026-27 season, the following structure will follow. For each division, its official name and number of clubs is given:

<text>The Catholic Church in the [[Dominican Republic]] is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.

The Catholic Church is the world&#x27;s largest Christian Church, and its largest religious grouping. There are an estimated 5 million Catholics in the Dominican Republic (48% of the population). In 2020, just over 50% of Dominicans identified as Catholic, served by 1140 priests across 709 parishes.

==Hierarchy==
Within the Dominican Republic the hierarchy consists of:
*Archbishopric
**Bishopric

* Archdiocese of Santiago de los Caballeros
** Diocese of La Vega
** Diocese of Mao-Monte Cristi
** Diocese of Puerto Plata
** Diocese of San Francisco de Macorís
* Archdiocese of Santo Domingo
** Diocese of Baní
** Diocese of Barahona
** Diocese of Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia in Higüey
** Diocese of San Juan de la Maguana
** Diocese of San Pedro de Macorís
* Military Ordinariate of the Dominican Republic

==Church in society==
The Dominican Republic offers religious freedom, and Catholicism is the official religion of the state; this was signed into law by the 1954 concordat with the Vatican. Under Rafael Trujillo&#x27;s government, the power of the Catholic Church was limited.

<doc id="563609" wikidata="Q595171" url="?curid=563609" title="Elongated Man">
<text>Elongated Man (Randolph William &quot;Ralph&quot; Dibny) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He first appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; #112 (February 25, 1960).

The character made his live-action debut on The CW&#x27;s live-action Arrowverse television series &quot;The Flash&quot;, portrayed by Hartley Sawyer. Additionally, Jeremy Piven, Sean Donnellan, and David Kaye have voiced the character in animation.

==Publication history==
Elongated Man was created by writer John Broome and penciler Carmine Infantino, with significant input from editor Julius Schwartz, who wanted a new supporting character for the Flash. Schwartz has noted that Elongated Man was only created because he had not realized that Plastic Man was available due to DC obtaining the rights to him in 1956 alongside other Quality Comics properties. However, Infantino and inker Murphy Anderson stated that they never used Plastic Man as a reference.

In his 2000 autobiography, &quot;The Amazing World of Carmine Infantino&quot;, the artist wrote, &quot;I really liked Elongated Man because it was comical and I enjoyed drawing comedy. It was also one of my favorite strips, because it was as close to animation as I could do in a comic book. I liked being able to test the limits of the comic book form and this strip allowed me to do that.&quot;

Elongated Man received a solo backup feature in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, where he was redefined as a detective who loves odd mysteries and travels the United States in a convertible with his wife, searching for them. Sometimes they would travel the world or meet other DC superheroes like Batman, Green Lantern, the Atom and Zatanna. This feature became sporadic during the late &#x27;60s and throughout the &#x27;70s. However, in 1973, he became a member of the Justice League of America, and he is mostly seen in that title from 1973 to 1995.

==Fictional character biography==
As a teenager, Ralph Dibny was fascinated by contortionists, or people who displayed feats of agility and suppleness. He learned that all of the body-benders he spoke with drank a popular soda called &quot;Gingold&quot;. Ralph set to work learning chemistry and developed a super-concentrated extract of the rare &quot;gingo&quot; fruit of the Yucatán, which gave him his elasticity. In his first appearance, the Flash suspects Elongated Man is behind several crimes, but he helps capture the criminals, who reveal they used a helicopter to frame him.

Ralph Dibny was one of the earliest Silver Age DC heroes to reveal his secret identity to the public, and also one of the first to marry his love interest. After teaming up with several other superheroes like Batman, Green Lantern, the Atom, Zatanna and the Justice League of America, he became a member of the team. Eventually, his wife Sue Dibny became a member as well. The couple was also notable in having a stable, happy, and relatively trouble-free marriage—an anomaly in the soap operatic annals of superhero comic books.

===&quot;Identity Crisis&quot;===

Ralph Dibny played a central role in the events of &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, with the main arc of the series revolving around Sue Dibny being murdered. The two&#x27;s relationship, and the events that led to and resulted from her death, were used as primary narrative devices throughout the series for examining the respective personal relationships of other JLA and JSA members.

The effect of Sue&#x27;s death on Ralph (compounded by the fact that Sue was apparently pregnant at the time of her death) would come to shape his character significantly in the events following &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, eventually culminating at the end of the weekly series &quot;52&quot;.

Ralph and Sue appeared as members of the Justice League offshoot the Super Buddies in the miniseries &quot;Formerly Known as the Justice League&quot; and its sequel story arc &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not The Justice League&quot; published in &quot;JLA: Classified&quot; #4–9. The latter arc was produced before &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, but published afterwards. A running joke in &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not The Justice League&quot; involves the possibility of Sue&#x27;s pregnancy.

===&quot;52&quot;===

In the 2006 weekly series &quot;52&quot;, a grief-stricken Ralph Dibny is contemplating suicide when he is informed that Sue&#x27;s gravestone has been vandalized with an inverted version of Superman&#x27;s &#x27;S&#x27; symbol—the Kryptonian symbol for resurrection. He confronts Cassie Sandsmark, and she tells Ralph that she is in a cult that believes that Superboy can be resurrected. She steals Ralph&#x27;s wedding ring after the cult members try to drown him.

During Week 11, after scaring some cult members and chasing them off, he gets a report that someone broke into a storage container in Opal City and stole Sue&#x27;s clothes. In Week 12, Ralph finds Wonder Girl and she tells him they stole the clothes and ring to make a Sue dummy. She invites him to the ceremony.

During Week 13, Ralph goes to the ceremony. Metamorpho, the Green Arrow, Zauriel, and Hal Jordan come with him. Despite his initial agreement, Ralph and his friends disrupt the ceremony, but the effigy of Sue crawls to Ralph and calls out to him as it burns; Ralph suffers a nervous breakdown as a result.

During Week 18, other members of the Croatoan Society (Detective Chimp, Terri Thirteen, and Edogawa Sangaku) find Tim Trench dead with the helmet of Doctor Fate, Nabu. Ralph comes to investigate and asks for help from the Shadowpact, Detective Chimp&#x27;s other group. A voice from within the helm of Doctor Fate, unheard by the other members of the group, speaks to Ralph and promises to fulfill his desires if he makes certain sacrifices. Ralph journeys with the helmet through the afterlives of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic.

During Week 27, the Spectre promises to resurrect Sue in exchange for Ralph taking vengeance on Jean Loring, but Ralph is unable to do so.

During Week 32, Ralph ventures to Nanda Parbat and gets into a fight with the Yeti. The Accomplished Perfect Physician comes to the rescue. Both he and the Yeti are members of the Great Ten, defenders of China. At Nanda Parbat, Rama Kushna tells Dibny, &quot;The end is already written.&quot;

During week 42, Ralph is in Doctor Fate&#x27;s tower. He begins the spell to resurrect Sue, puts on the helmet of Fate, and shoots it, revealing Felix Faust, who was posing as Nabu. Faust planned to trade Dibny&#x27;s soul to Neron in exchange for his freedom. Ralph reveals that he was aware of Faust&#x27;s identity for some time, and that the binding spell surrounding the tower is designed to imprison Faust, not to counter any negative effects of the spell. Neron appears and kills Dibny, only to realize that the binding spell responds only to Dibny&#x27;s commands: through his death, Ralph has trapped Faust and Neron in the tower. His spirit is later seen reunited with his wife. However, Neron is able to escape almost immediately. During the &quot;Black Adam: The Dark Ages&quot; miniseries, Faust is shown to escape with the help of Black Adam and a resurrected Isis, who is under Faust&#x27;s mental control. These events take place just prior to &quot;Countdown&quot;, indicating that Faust had only been there for a few weeks.

At the end of Week 52, it is revealed that Dibny&#x27;s magical, wish-granting gun (a souvenir from &quot;the Anselmo Case&quot;, a reference to &quot;The Life Story of the Flash&quot;) worked—Ralph&#x27;s last wish was to be reunited with his wife, even in death—and that Ralph and Sue are now reunited as ghost detectives, investigating a school where a paranormal phenomenon has just occurred.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===

In &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; #16, Traci 13 mentions that Ralph and Sue adopted her following her mother&#x27;s death.

In the 2007-08 &quot;Black Adam&quot; miniseries &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, it is shown that Ralph&#x27;s remains are still inside Fate&#x27;s Tower when Teth-Adam asks Faust if his deal to trick Ralph had worked. Ralph&#x27;s skeleton is used by Faust to create the illusion that Adam&#x27;s attempt at resurrecting Isis had failed.

In &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; (vol. 2) #5, it is revealed (after appearing unknown in the previous two issues) that Ralph and Sue have gained or discovered the ability to possess human bodies, similar to Deadman.

===&quot;Reign in Hell&quot;===
Ralph and Sue, in their ghostly forms, appear before Doctor Occult with news of the war brewing in Hell. Sent by Zatara who, as a member of the Hell Resistance Movement, hopes to take advantage of the war, they ask Doctor Occult to aid him in his plan. They then dissipate and leave him to make his decision.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Ralph and Sue Dibny are revived as Black Lanterns before being killed when the Indigo Tribe destroys their rings. The Flash hopes that the White Entity will resurrect the two, only to be told that they are not coming back.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In September 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; reboots DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Ralph Dibny is a rogue member of the Secret Six, under the alias of Damon Wells a.k.a. Big Shot, reporting to the Riddler who in this incarnation of the team serves as &quot;Mockingbird.&quot; After having reunited with his wife, Dibny makes his return as the costumed Elongated Man in &quot;Secret Six&quot; (vol. 4) #12.

==Powers and abilities==
Elongated Man gained his abilities by drinking a refined version of a soft drink named Gingold that contains gingo fruit extract. It was revealed in &quot;Invasion&quot; #3 that he is a metahuman, and the Gingold interacted with his latent genes. An ordinary human would not develop such powers through ingesting the extract. In fact, most people are allergic to concentrated Gingold. The only other hero in the DCU who uses Gingold is Stretch, a member of Hero Hotline who has been using the compound since the 1940s.

As his name suggests, Elongated Man can stretch his limbs and body to superhuman lengths and sizes. These stretching powers grant him heightened agility, enabling flexibility and coordination that is beyond the natural limits of the human body. He can contort his body into various positions and sizes impossible for ordinary humans, such as being entirely flat so that he can slip under a door, or using his fingers to pick conventional locks. He can also use it for disguise by changing the shape of his face, although this is painful and difficult for him. Ralph&#x27;s physiology has greater physical limitations than Plastic Man; there is a limit to how far he can stretch his finite bodily mass, and he cannot open holes in his body as Plastic Man can.

Elongated Man&#x27;s powers also greatly augment his durability. He is largely able to withstand corrosives, punctures and concussions without sustaining injury. It has been demonstrated that he is resistant to high velocities that would kill an ordinary person and that he is also more resistant to blasts from energy weapons that would kill ordinary humans. His physiology is more like that of an ordinary human than Plastic Man; he is not nearly invulnerable like Plastic Man.

In addition to his stretching abilities, Elongated Man is a professional detective and highly skilled in deductive reasoning. He is considered one of the most brilliant detectives in the DC Universe, comparable to Batman. He is a talented amateur chemist as well. A meta-side effect of his powers coupled with his detective skills is enhanced olfactory sense, allowing him to &quot;smell&quot; when something is &quot;not right&quot;, or if a clue or mystery is at hand. This results in a rubbery nose twitch.

<text>Ubisoft Entertainment SA (; ; formerly Ubi Soft Entertainment SA) is a French video game publisher headquartered in Saint-Mandé with development studios across the world. Its video game franchises include &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;, &quot;Driver&quot;, &quot;Far Cry&quot;, &quot;Just Dance&quot;, &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, &quot;Rabbids&quot;, &quot;Rayman&quot;, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Watch Dogs&quot;.

== History ==

=== Origins and first decade (1986–1996) ===
By the 1980s, the Guillemot family had established itself as a support business for farmers in the Brittany province of France and other regions, including into the United Kingdom. The five sons of the family – Christian, Claude, Gérard, Michel, and Yves – helped with the company&#x27;s sales, distribution, accounting, and management with their parents before university.

All five gained business experience while at university, which they brought back to the family business after graduating. The brothers came up with the idea of diversification to sell other products of use to farmers; Claude began with selling CD audio media. Later, the brothers expanded to computers and additional software that included video games.

In the 1980s, they saw that the costs of buying computers and software from a French supplier were more expensive than buying the same materials in the United Kingdom and shipping to France, and came upon the idea of a mail-order business around computers and software. Their mother said they could start their own business this way as long as they managed it themselves and equally split its shares among the five of them.

Their first business was Guillemot Informatique, founded in 1984. They originally only sold through mail order, and then were getting orders from French retailers, since they were able to undercut other suppliers by up to 50% of the cost of some titles. By 1986, this company was earning about 40 million French francs (roughly at that time). In 1985, the brothers established Guillemot Corporation for similar distribution of computer hardware. As demand continued, the brothers recognised that video game software was becoming a lucrative property and decided that they needed to get into the industry&#x27;s development side, already having insight on the publication and distribution side.

Ubi Soft (formally named Ubi Soft Entertainment S.A.) was founded by the brothers on 28 March 1986. The name &quot;Ubi Soft&quot; was selected to represent &quot;ubiquitous&quot; software.

Ubi Soft initially operated out of offices in Paris, moving to Créteil by June 1986. The brothers used the chateau in Brittany as the primary space for development, hoping the setting would lure developers, as well as to have a better way to manage expectations of their developers. The company hired Nathalie Saloud as manager, Sylvie Hugonnier as director of marketing and public relations, and programmers, though Hugonnier had left the company by May 1986 to join Elite Software. Games published by Ubi Soft in 1986 include &quot;Zombi&quot;, &quot;Ciné Clap&quot;, &quot;Fer et Flamme&quot;, &quot;Masque&quot;, and Graphic City, a sprite editing program. As their first game, &quot;Zombi&quot; had sold 5,000 copies by January 1987. Ubi Soft also entered into distribution partnerships for the game to be released in Spain and West Germany. Ubi Soft started importing products from abroad for distribution in France, with 1987 releases including Elite Software&#x27;s &quot;Commando&quot; and &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, the former of which sold 15,000 copies by January 1987. In 1988, Yves Guillemot was appointed as Ubi Soft&#x27;s chief executive officer.

By 1988, the company had about 6 developers working from the chateau. These included Michel Ancel, a teenager at the time noted for his animation skills, and Serge Hascoët, who applied to be a video game tester for the company. The costs of maintaining the chateau became more expensive, and the developers were given the option to relocate to Paris. Ancel&#x27;s family which had moved to Brittany for his job could not afford the cost of living in Paris and returned to Montpellier in southern France. The Guillemot brothers told Ancel to keep them abreast of anything he might come up with there. Ancel returned with Frédéric Houde with a prototype of a game with animated features that caught the brothers&#x27; interest. Michel Guillemot decided to make the project a key one for the company, establishing a studio in Montreuil to house over 100 developers in 1994, and targeting a line of 5th generation consoles such as the Atari Jaguar and PlayStation. Their game, &quot;Rayman&quot;, was released in 1995. Yves managed Guillemot Informatique, making deals with Electronic Arts, Sierra On-Line and MicroProse to distribute their games in France. Guillemot Informatique began expanding to other markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. They entered the video game distribution and wholesale markets and by 1993 had become the &quot;largest&quot; distributor of video games in France.

=== Worldwide growth (1996–2003) ===
In 1996, Ubi Soft listed its initial public offering and raised over in funds to help them to expand the company. Within 2 years, the company established worldwide studios in Annecy (1996), Shanghai (1996), Montreal (1997), and Milan (1998).

A difficulty that the brothers found was the lack of an intellectual property that would have a foothold in the United States market. When &quot;widespread growth&quot; of the Internet arrived around 1999, the brothers decided to take advantage of this by founding game studios aimed at online free-to-play titles, including GameLoft; this allowed them to license the rights to Ubi Soft properties to these companies, increasing the share value of Ubi Soft five-fold. With the extra infusion of , they were able to then purchase Red Storm Entertainment in 2000, giving them access to the &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s&quot; series of stealth and spy games. Ubi Soft helped with Red Storm to continue to expand the series, bringing titles like &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot; and &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; series. The company got a foothold in the United States when it worked with Microsoft to develop &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot;, an Xbox-exclusive title released in 2002 to challenge the PlayStation-exclusive &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; series, by combining elements of &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s&quot; series with elements of an in-house developed game called &quot;The Drift&quot;.

In March 2001, Gores Technology Group sold The Learning Company&#x27;s entertainment division (which included games originally published by Broderbund, Mattel Interactive, Mindscape and Strategic Simulations) to them. The sale included the rights to intellectual properties such as the &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; series. Ubisoft Montreal developed the &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; title into &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot; released in 2003. At the same time, Ubi Soft released &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot;, Ancel&#x27;s project after &quot;Rayman&quot;; it was one of Ubi Soft&#x27;s first commercial &quot;flops&quot; on its release but which since has gained a cult following.

Around 2001, Ubi Soft established its editorial department headed by Hascoët, initially named as editor in chief and later known as the company&#x27;s Chief Content Officer. Hascoët had worked alongside Ancel on &quot;Rayman&quot; in 1995 to help refine the game, and saw the opportunity to apply that across all of Ubi Soft&#x27;s games. Until 2019, most games published by Ubisoft were reviewed through the editorial department overseen by Hascoët.

=== Continued expansion (2003–2015) ===
On 9 September 2003, Ubi Soft announced that it would change its name to Ubisoft, and introduced a new logo known as &quot;the swirl&quot;. In December 2004, gaming corporation Electronic Arts purchased a 19.9% stake in the firm. Ubisoft referred to the purchase as &quot;hostile&quot; on EA&#x27;s part. Ubisoft&#x27;s brothers recognised they had not considered themselves within a competitive market, and employees had feared that an EA takeover would drastically alter the environment within Ubisoft. EA&#x27;s CEO at the time, John Riccitiello, assured Ubisoft the purchase was not meant as a hostile manoeuvre, and EA ended up selling the shares in 2010.

In February 2005, Ubisoft acquired the &quot;NHL Rivals&quot;, &quot;NFL Fever&quot;, &quot;NBA Inside Drive&quot; and &quot;MLB Inside Pitch&quot; franchises from Microsoft Game Studios.

Ubisoft established another IP, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;, first launched in 2007; &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; was originally developed by Ubisoft Montreal as a sequel to &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot; and instead transitioned to a story about Assassins and the Templar Knights. In July 2006, Ubisoft bought the &quot;Driver&quot; franchise from Atari for a sum of €19 million in cash for the franchise, technology rights, and most assets. Within 2008, Ubisoft made a deal with Tom Clancy for perpetual use of his name and intellectual property for video games and other auxiliary media. In July 2008, Ubisoft made the acquisition of Hybride Technologies, a Piedmont-based studio. In November 2008, Ubisoft acquired Massive Entertainment from Activision. In January 2013, Ubisoft acquired &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot; from THQ for $3.265 million.

Ubisoft announced plans in 2013 to invest $373 million into its Quebec operations over 7 years. The publisher is investing in the expansion of its motion capture technologies and consolidating its online games operations and infrastructure in Montreal. By 2020, the company would employ more than 3,500 staff at its studios in Montreal and Quebec City. In February 2013, it began offering games from third-party publisher including Electronic Arts and Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment on its Uplay Shop and its own games to EA&#x27;s Origin.

In July 2013, Ubisoft announced a breach in its network resulting in the potential exposure of up to 58 million accounts including usernames, email address, and encrypted passwords. The firm denied any credit/debit card information could have been compromised, issued directives to all registered users to change their account passwords, and recommended updating passwords on any other website or service where a same or similar password had been used. All the users who registered were emailed by the Ubisoft company about the breach and a password change request. Ubisoft promised to keep the information safe.

In March 2015, the company set up a Consumer Relationship Centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The centre is intended to integrate consumer support teams and community managers. Consumer Support and Community Management teams at the CRC are operational 7 days a week.

=== Attempted takeover by Vivendi (2015–2018) ===
Since around 2015, the French mass media company Vivendi has been seeking to expand its media properties through acquisitions and other business deals. In addition to advertising firm Havas, Ubisoft was one of the first target properties identified by Vivendi, which as of September 2017 has an estimated valuation of $6.4 billion. Vivendi, in two actions during October 2015, bought shares in Ubisoft stock, giving them a 10.4% stake in Ubisoft, an action that Yves Guillemot considered &quot;unwelcome&quot; and feared a hostile takeover. In a presentation during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, Yves Guillemot stressed the importance that Ubisoft remain an independent company to maintain its creative freedom. Guillemot later described the need to fight off the takeover: &quot;...when you&#x27;re attacked with a company that has a different philosophy, you know it can affect what you&#x27;ve been creating from scratch. So you fight with a lot of energy to make sure it can&#x27;t be destroyed.&quot; Vice-president of Live Operations, Anne Blondel-Jouin, expressed similar sentiment in an interview with &quot;PCGamesN&quot;, stating that Ubisoft&#x27;s success was partly due to &quot;...being super independent, being very autonomous.&quot;

Vivendi acquired stake in mobile game publisher Gameloft, owned by the Guillemots, and started acquiring Ubisoft shares. In the following February, Vivendi acquired €500 million worth of shares in Gameloft, gaining more than 30% of the shares and requiring the company under French law to make a public tender offer; this action enabled Vivendi to complete the takeover of Gameloft by June 2016. Following Vivendi&#x27;s actions with Gameloft in February 2016, the Guillemots asked for more Canadian investors in the following February to fend off a similar Vivendi takeover; by this point, Vivendi had increased their share in Ubisoft to 15%, exceeding the estimated 9% that the Guillemots owned. By June 2016, Vivendi had increased its shares to 20.1% and denied it was in the process of a takeover.

By the time of Ubisoft&#x27;s annual board meeting in September 2016, Vivendi had gained 23% of the shares, while the Guillemots were able to increase their voting share to 20%. A request was made at the board meeting to place Vivendi representatives on Ubisoft&#x27;s board, given the size of their shareholdings. The Guillemots argued against this, reiterating that Vivendi should be seen as a competitor, and succeeded in swaying other voting members to deny any board seats to Vivendi.

Vivendi continued to buy shares in Ubisoft, approaching the 30% mark that could trigger a takeover; as of December 2016, Vivendi held a 25.15% stake in Ubisoft. Reuters reported in April 2017 that Vivendi&#x27;s takeover of Ubisoft would likely happen that year and &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; observed that some of Vivendi&#x27;s shares would reach the 2-year holding mark, which would grant them double voting power, and would likely meet or exceed the 30% threshold. The Guillemot family has since raised its stake in Ubisoft; as of June 2017, the family held 13.6% of Ubisoft&#x27;s share capital, and 20.02% of the company&#x27;s voting rights. In October 2017, Ubisoft announced it reached a deal with an &quot;investment services provider&quot; to help them purchase back 4 million shares by the end of the year, preventing others, specifically Vivendi, from buying these.

In the week before Vivendi would gain double-voting rights for previously purchased shares, the company, in quarterly results published in November 2017, announced that it had no plans to acquire Ubisoft for the next 6 months, nor would seek board positions due to the shares they held during that time, and that it &quot;would ensure that its interest in Ubisoft would not exceed the threshold of 30% through the doubling of its voting rights.&quot; Vivendi remained committed to expanding in the video game sector, identifying that their investment in Ubisoft could represent a capital gain of over 1 billion euros.

On 20 March 2018, Ubisoft and Vivendi struck a deal ending any potential takeover, with Vivendi agreeing to sell all of its shares, over 30 million, to other parties and agreeing to not buy any Ubisoft shares for 5 years. Some of those shares were sold to Tencent, which after the transaction held about 5.6 million shares of Ubisoft (approximately 5% of all shares). The same day, Ubisoft announced a partnership with Tencent to help bring their games into the Chinese market. Vivendi completely divested its shares in Ubisoft by March 2019.

=== Investment by Tencent (2018–2022) ===
Since 2018, Ubisoft&#x27;s studios have continued to focus on some franchises, including &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Far Cry&quot;, and &quot;Watch Dogs&quot;. As reported by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;, while Ubisoft as a whole had nearly 16,000 developers by mid-2019, larger than some of its competitors, and producing 5 to 6 major AAA releases each year compared to the 2 or 3 from the others, the net revenue earned per employee was the lowest of the 4 due to generally lower sales of its games. &quot;Bloomberg Business&quot; attributed this partially due to spending trends by video game consumers purchasing fewer games with long playtimes, as most of Ubisoft&#x27;s major releases tend to be. To counter this, Ubisoft in October 2019 postponed 3 of the 6 titles it had planned in 2019 to 2020 or later, as to help place more effort on improving the quality of the existing and released games. Due to overall weak sales in 2019, Ubisoft stated in January 2020 that it would be reorganizing its editorial board to provide a more comprehensive look at its game portfolio and devise greater variation in its games which Ubisoft&#x27;s management said had fallen stagnant, too uniform and had contributed to weak sales.

Stemming from a wave of sexual misconduct accusations of the #MeToo movement in June and July 2020, Ubisoft had a number of employees accused of misconduct from both internal and external sources. Between Ubisoft&#x27;s internal investigation and a study by the newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;, employees had been found to have records of sexual misconduct and troubling behaviour, going back up to 10 years, which had been dismissed by the human resources departments. As a result, some Ubisoft staff either quit or were fired, including Hascoët, Maxime Béland, the co-founder of Ubisoft Toronto, and Yannis Mallat, the managing director of Ubisoft&#x27;s Canadian studios. Yves Guillemot implemented changes in the company to address these issues as it further investigated the extent of the misconduct claims.

Ubisoft stated in its end of 2020 fiscal year investor call in February 2021 that the company will start to make AAA game releases less of a focus and put more focus on mobile and freemium games following fiscal year 2022. CFO Frederick Duguet stated to investors that &quot;we see that we are progressively, continuously moving from a model that used to be only focused on AAA releases to a model where we have a combination of strong releases from AAA and strong back catalog dynamics, but also complimenting our program of new releases with free-to-play and other premium experiences.&quot; Later that year, the company announced it would start branding games developed by its 1st-party developers as &quot;Ubisoft Originals&quot;.

In 2021, they announced that they would be making an open world &quot;Star Wars&quot; game. The deal marked an end to EA&#x27;s exclusive rights to make &quot;Star Wars&quot; titles. In October 2021, Ubisoft participated in a round of financing in Animoca Brands.

In November 2021, Ubisoft announced the development of their first Ubisoft Entertainment Center, created by experience design firm Storyland Studios and Alterface. The first location is set to open in Studios Occitanie Méditerranée by 2025.

Ubisoft has been increasingly involved in blockchain-based video games since the later 2010s. The company is a co-founder of the Blockchain Game Alliance, which was established in September 2018 and is a consortium of several companies active in the blockchain space that seeks to explore the potential applications of this technology in the video game industry and publicly promotes the use of blockchain-based content in video games. According to Yves Guillemot, one of Ubisoft&#x27;s co-founders, crypto-based content in video games will allow players to actually own digital content within it, while growing the video game industry in the process. Ubisoft furthermore announced its Ubisoft Quartz blockchain program in December 2021, allowing players to buy uniquely identified customization items for games and then sell and trade them based on the Tezos currency, which Ubisoft claimed was an energy efficient cryptocurrency. This marked the first &quot;AAA&quot; effort into blockchain games. The announcement was heavily criticized by audiences, with the Quartz announcement video attaining a dislike ratio of 96% on YouTube. Ubisoft subsequently unlisted the video from YouTube. The announcement was also criticized internally by Ubisoft developers.

In July 2022, Ubisoft announced that it had cancelled &quot;Splinter Cell VR&quot; and &quot;Ghost Recon Frontline&quot;, along with two other unannounced titles. In September, Tencent invested another into Guillemot Brothers Limited, the company that holds part of the Guillemots&#x27; ownership of Ubisoft. This gave Tencent 49.9% ownership in this holding company and increased the Guillemots&#x27; share of voting rights within Ubisoft to about 30%. Yves Guillemot said that Tencent would be working closely with Ubisoft, helping to bring their games into China while assisting in paying off Ubisoft&#x27;s debts and preventing the company from potential buyouts.

===Financial troubles (2023–present)===
Citing disappointing financial results in the previous quarter, Ubisoft cancelled another three previously unannounced games in January 2023. In an email to staff, Yves Guillemot told employees to take responsibility for the company&#x27;s forthcoming projects, asking that &quot;each of you be especially careful and strategic with your spending and initiatives, to ensure we&#x27;re being as efficient and lean as possible&quot;, while also saying that &quot;The ball is in your court to deliver this line-up on time and at the expected level of quality, and show everyone what we are capable of achieving.&quot; Union workers at Ubisoft Paris took issue with this message, calling for a strike and demanding higher salaries and improved working conditions.

As part of a change in the terms of their acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October 2023 to satisfy government regulators, Microsoft gave Ubisoft the rights for cloud gaming of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s games.

As part of a cost reduction plan, Ubisoft reduced its number of employees from 20,279 in 2022 to 19,410 in September 2023. In November 2023, Ubisoft laid off 124 employees from its VFX and IT teams. In March 2024, Ubisoft laid off 45 employees from its publishing teams. Another 45 employees were cut between its San Francisco and Cary, North Carolina offices in August 2024. By the end of September 2024, Ubisoft had reduced its number of employees to 18,666.

In 2024, Ubisoft released multiple games that experienced underperforming sales and declining playerbases post-launch, which included &quot;&quot;, &quot;Skull and Bones&quot;, &quot;XDefiant&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars Outlaws&quot;, causing its stock to fall to nearly its lowest levels in the previous decade. As a result, the company announced they were launching an investigation of their development cycles to focus on a &quot;player-centric approach&quot;, and opted to delay its next major flagship game, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows&quot;, from November 2024 to February 2025. At the same time, one of its shareholders, AJ Investments, stated they were seeking to have the company purchased by a private equity firm and would push out the Guillemot family and Tencent from ownership of the company. &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported in October 2024 that the Guillemots and Tencent were considering this and other alternatives to shift ownership of the company in light of the recent poor financial performance. Later reports in December 2024 suggested that Tencent was seeking to capture a majority stake in Ubisoft and take the company private, while still giving the Guillemot family control of Ubisoft. Bloomberg reported in January 2025 that Tencent and the Guillemots may be looking to form a new venture under Tencent&#x27;s control, moving some assets from Ubisoft into it, to help boost Ubisoft&#x27;s value.

On October 16, 2024, over 700 Ubisoft employees in France began a three-day strike, protesting the company&#x27;s requirement to return to the office three days a week. The strike, organized by the STJV union, involved Ubisoft&#x27;s offices in Paris, Montpellier, Lyon, and Annecy. Workers expressed dissatisfaction over a lack of flexibility, salary increases, and profit-sharing, which they believe the company has ignored. Ubisoft has yet to address the union&#x27;s concerns.

In December 2024, Ubisoft announced that their free-to-play game &quot;XDefiant&quot; would be shutting down in June 2025, less than a year after its initial release. They also announced that its lead development studio Ubisoft San Francisco, and Ubisoft Osaka, were to close, resulting in up to 277 employees being laid off.

In January 2025, Ubisoft closed the Ubisoft Leamington studio and downsized several other studios, resulting in up to 185 staff being laid off as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures.

== Subsidiaries ==

== Technology ==

=== Ubisoft Connect ===

Ubisoft Connect, formerly Uplay, is a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and communications service for PC created by Ubisoft. First launched alongside &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot; as a rewards program to earn points towards in-game content for completing achievements within Ubisoft, it expanded into a desktop client and storefront for Windows machine alongside other features. Ubisoft then separated the rewards program out as its Ubisoft Club program, integrated with Uplay. Ubisoft Connect was announced in October 2020 as a replacement for UPlay and its Ubisoft Club to launch on 29 October 2020 alongside &quot;Watch Dogs: Legion&quot;. Connect replaces UPlay and the club&#x27;s previous functions while adding support for cross-platform play and save progression for some games. It includes the same reward progression system that the Club offered to gain access to in-game content. Some games on the UPlay service will not be updated to support these reward features that they previously had under the Ubisoft Club; for those, Ubisoft will unlock all rewards for all players.

Uplay/Ubisoft Connect serves to manage the digital rights for Ubisoft&#x27;s games on Windows computers, which has led to criticism when it was first launched, as some games required always-on digital rights management, causing loss of save game data should players lose their Internet connection. The situation was aggravated after Ubisoft&#x27;s servers were struck with denial of service attacks that made the Ubisoft games unplayable due to this DRM scheme. Ubisoft eventually abandoned the always-on DRM scheme and still require all Ubisoft games to perform a start-up check through Uplay/Ubisoft Connect servers when launched.

===Game engines===
==== Ubisoft Anvil ====

Ubisoft Anvil, formerly named Scimitar, is a proprietary game engine developed wholly within Ubisoft Montreal in 2007 for the development of the first &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; game and has since been expanded and used for most &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; titles and other Ubisoft games, including &quot;Ghost Recon Wildlands&quot;, &quot;Ghost Recon Breakpoint&quot; and &quot;For Honor&quot;.

==== Disrupt ====
The Disrupt game engine was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and is used for the &quot;Watch Dogs&quot; games. Developer Ubisoft Montreal spent four years creating the engine. The majority of Disrupt was built from scratch and uses a multithreaded renderer, running on fully deferred physically based rendering pipeline with some technological twists to allow for more advanced effects. The engine also has a feature that allows players to connect and disconnect their game from others without causing major disruptions in the game environment or storyline progress. Its open world city management comes from AnvilNext while its vegetation and AI are from Dunia. Parts of the engine were originally intended for another game in the &quot;Driver&quot; franchise.

==== Dunia ====
The Dunia engine is a software fork of the CryEngine that was originally developed by Crytek, with modifications made by Ubisoft Montreal. The CryEngine at the time could render some outdoor environmental spaces. Crytek had created a demo of its engine called &quot;X-Isle: Dinosaur Island&quot; which it had demonstrated at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 1999. Ubisoft saw the demo and had Crytek build out the demo into a full title, becoming the first &quot;Far Cry&quot;, released in 2004. That year, Electronic Arts established a deal with Crytek to build a wholly different title with an improved version of the CryEngine, leaving them unable to continue work on &quot;Far Cry&quot;. Ubisoft assigned Ubisoft Montreal to develop console versions of &quot;Far Cry&quot;, and arranging with Crytek to have all rights to the &quot;Far Cry&quot; series and a perpetual licence on the CryEngine.

In developing &quot;Far Cry 2&quot;, Ubisoft Montreal modified the CryEngine to include destructible environments and a more realistic physics engine. This modified version became the Dunia engine which premiered with &quot;Far Cry 2&quot; in 2008. The Dunia engine continued to be improved, such as adding weather systems, and used as the basis of all future &quot;Far Cry&quot; games, and &quot;&quot;, developed by Ubisoft Montreal.

Ubisoft introduced the Dunia 2 engine first in &quot;Far Cry 3&quot; in 2012, which was made to improve the performance of Dunia-based games on consoles and to add more complex rendering features such as global illumination. The Dunia 2 engine was further refined in &quot;Far Cry 4&quot;, and &quot;Far Cry 5&quot;. According to Remi Quenin, one of the engine&#x27;s architects at Ubisoft Montreal, the state of the Dunia engine by 2017 included &quot;vegetation, fire simulation, destruction, vehicles, systemic AI, wildlife, weather, day/night cycles, [and] non linear storytelling&quot; which are elements of the &quot;Far Cry&quot; games. For &quot;Far Cry 6&quot;, Ubisoft introduced more features to the Dunia 2 engine such as ray tracing support on the PC version, and support for AMD&#x27;s open source variable resolution technology, FidelityFX Super Resolution. Aside from the main entries in the &quot;Far Cry&quot; series, the Dunia 2 engine is also used in the spin-off games. These include &quot;Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon&quot;, &quot;Far Cry Primal&quot;, and &quot;Far Cry New Dawn&quot;.

==== Snowdrop ====

The Snowdrop game engine was co-developed by Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft for &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division&quot;. The core of the game engine is powered by a &quot;node-based system&quot; which simplifies the process of connecting different systems like rendering, AI, mission scripting and the user interface. The engine is also used in other Ubisoft games such as &quot;South Park: The Fractured but Whole&quot;, &quot;Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars Outlaws&quot;.

== Games ==

According to Guillemot, Ubisoft recognised that connected sandbox games, with seamless switches between single and multiplayer modes provided the players with more fun, leading the company to switch from pursuing single-player only games to internet connected ones. According to Guillemot, Ubisoft internally refers to its reimagined self as &#x27;before &quot;The Division&quot;″ and an &#x27;after &quot;The Division&quot;″.

In an interview with &quot;The Verge&quot;, Anne Blondel-Jouin, executive producer of &quot;The Crew&quot; turned vice-president of live operations, noted that &quot;The Crew&quot; was an early game of Ubisoft&#x27;s to require a persistent internet connection in order to play. This raised concerns for gamers and internally at the company.

== Film and television ==
Ubisoft initiated its Ubisoft Film &amp; Television division then named Ubisoft Motion Pictures in 2011. Initially developing media works tied to Ubisoft&#x27;s games, it has since diversified to other works including about video games. Productions include the live-action film &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; (2016) and the series &quot;Rabbids Invasion&quot; (2013), and &quot;Mythic Quest&quot; (2020–present).

==Litigation==

===2020 sexual misconduct accusations and dismissals===
===Other lawsuits===
* In 2008, Ubisoft sued Optical Experts Manufacturing (OEM), a DVD duplication company for $25 million plus damages for the leak and distribution of the PC version of &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;. The lawsuit claims that OEM did not take proper measures to protect its product as stated in its contract with Ubisoft. The complaint alleges that OEM admitted to all the problems in the complaint.
* In April 2012, Ubisoft was sued by John L. Beiswenger, the author of the book &quot;Link&quot; who alleged copyright infringement for using his ideas in the &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; franchise. He demanded $5.25 million in damages and a halt to the release of &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot; which was set to be released in October 2012, along with any future games that allegedly contain his ideas. On 30 May 2012, Beiswenger dropped the lawsuit. Beiswenger was later quoted as saying he believes &quot;authors should vigorously defend their rights in their creative works&quot;, and suggested that Ubisoft&#x27;s motion to block future lawsuits from Beiswenger hints at their guilt.
* In December 2014, Ubisoft offered a free game from their catalogue of recently released titles to compensate the season pass owners of &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&quot; due to its buggy launch. The terms offered with the free game revoked the user&#x27;s right to sue Ubisoft for the buggy launch of the game.
* In May 2020, Ubisoft sued Chinese developer Ejoy and Apple and Google over Ejoy&#x27;s &quot;Area F2&quot; game which Ubisoft contended was a carbon copy of &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot;. Ubisoft sought copyright action against Ejoy, and financial damages against Apple and Google for allowing &quot;Area F2&quot; to be distributed on their mobile app stores and profiting from its microtransactions.
* In November 2024, two Californians—Matthew Cassell and Alan Liu—filed a class action lawsuit against Ubisoft in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, after Ubisoft announced the shutdown of &quot;The Crew&quot; servers. Cassell and Liu accused the company of misleading players into believing that their purchases of the game were permanent instead of buying limited licenses and for &quot;falsely represent[ing]&quot; that the physical copies contained the game&#x27;s files instead of simply a key to unlock the DRM for the game.

<text>Septentrional, meaning &quot;of the north&quot;, is a Latinate adjective sometimes used in English. It is a form of the Latin noun &quot;septentriones&quot;, which refers to the seven stars of the &quot;Plough&quot; (Big Dipper), occasionally called the &quot;Septentrion&quot;.

In the 18th century, septentrional languages was a recognised term for the Germanic languages.

==Etymology and background==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives the etymology of &quot;septentrional&quot; as:

&quot;Septentrional&quot; is more or less synonymous with the term &quot;boreal&quot;, derived from Boreas, a Greek god of the North Wind. The constellation Ursa Major, containing the Big Dipper, or Plough, dominates the skies of the North. The usual antonym for &quot;septentrional&quot; is the term &quot;meridional&quot;, which refers to the noonday sun.

==Usage==

The term &quot;septentrional&quot; is found on maps, mostly those made before 1700. Early maps of North America often refer to the northern- and northwesternmost unexplored areas of the continent as at the &quot;Septentrional&quot; and as &quot;America Septentrionalis&quot;, sometimes with slightly varying spellings. Sometimes abbreviated to &quot;Sep.&quot;, it was used in historical astronomy to indicate the northern direction on the celestial globe, together with Meridional (&quot;Mer.&quot;) for southern, Oriental (&quot;Ori.&quot;) for eastern and Occidental (&quot;Occ.&quot;) for western.

The linguistic usage in the 17th and 18th centuries was as an umbrella term. It described &quot;the Germanic languages, usually with particular emphasis on Anglo-Saxon, Old Norse and Gothic.&quot; Writing of Johann Georg Keyßler in 1758, Thomas Gray distinguished between &quot;Celtic&quot; and &quot;septentrional&quot; antiquities. Thomas Percy actively criticised the blurring of the Celtic and the Germanic in the name of the &quot;septentrional&quot;, while at the same time Ossianism favoured it. James Ingram in his inaugural lecture of 1807 called George Hickes &quot;the first of septentrional scholars&quot; for his pioneering lexicographical work on Anglo-Saxon. In current usage, &quot;septentrional fiction&quot; may refer to a setting in the Canadian North.

In France, the term septentrional refers to the Northern stretch of the Côtes du Rhône AOC winemaking region. The Northern Rhône, or septentrional, runs along the Rhône river from Vienne in the north, to Montélimar in the south. It includes the eight crus: Côte Rôtie, Condrieu, Château-Grillet, Hermitage, Saint-Joseph, Crozes-Hermitage, Cornas and Saint-Péray. The Southern Rhône is referred to as the meridional (&quot;Rhône méridionale&quot;), and extends from Montélimar in the north, to Avignon in the south.

<text> (), known simply as Club Brugge (in English also: &quot;Club Bruges&quot;), is a Belgian professional football club based in Bruges, Belgium. It was founded in 1891 and its home ground is the Jan Breydel Stadium, which has a capacity of 29,042. They play in the Belgian Pro League, the top domestic league in Belgian football.

One of the most decorated clubs in Belgian football, Club Brugge has been crowned Belgian league champions 19 times, second only to major rivals Anderlecht, and shares the Jan Breydel Stadium with city rival Cercle Brugge, with whom they contest the Bruges derby.

Throughout its long history, &quot;Club&quot; has enjoyed much European football success, reaching two European finals and three European semi-finals. Club Brugge is the only Belgian club to have played the final of the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) as of November 2024, losing to Liverpool in the final of the 1978 season. They also lost in the 1976 UEFA Cup Final to the same opponents. Club Brugge holds the European record for number of consecutive participations in the UEFA Europa League (20), the record number of Belgian Cups (11), and the record number of Belgian Super Cups (17).

==History==
In 1890, students from the Catholic school Broeders Xaverianen and the neutral school Koninklijk Atheneum joined together to form the Brugsche Football Club. The former students christened the club&#x27;s founding by establishing the Latin motto &#x27;mens sana in corpore sano&#x27; (a healthy mind in a healthy body). A year later on 13 November 1891, the club was re-created under Brugsche FC, and this is now seen as the official foundation of the current Club Brugge. In 1892, an official board was installed at the club to oversee all operations and team decisions. In 1895, the national athletics sports union was founded, predecessor of the later national football association, under the name UBSSA (Union Belge des Sociétés de Sports Athlétiques); Brugsche FC was a founding member of the UBSSSA and as such took part in the first league campaign organized in Belgian football during the 1895–96 season. Financial difficulties in the following year forced the club to leave the UBSSA, and soon after, Football Club Brugeois was formed by breakaway club members. The two sides were reunited in 1897 under the French name of Football Club Brugeois; they did not take on the Dutch title Club Brugge until 1972.

In 1914, FC Brugeois reached their first Belgian Cup final, but lost 2–1 to Union SG. Six years later, the club claimed their first trophy, by winning the Belgian First Division during the 1919–20 season. They celebrated by changing their title to Royal FC Brugeois – with their regal status now reflected in their modern prefix KV, standing for Koninklijke Vereniging (royal club). Only eight years later though, the club was relegated to the Belgian Second Division for the first time in their history following a relegation play-off. Further lean times followed the relegation in 1928, as they spent much of the 1940s and 1950s in the second division of Belgian football.

Following the 1958–59 season, the club earned promotion back to the First Division and have not been relegated since. The club were able to add to their trophy cabinet in 1968, winning the first of their record 11 Belgian Cup titles for the first time after defeating Beerschot A.C. 7–6 in a penalty-shootout after a 1–1 draw.

The club enjoyed their most success under legendary Austrian manager Ernst Happel as he led the club to three straight league championships from 1975–76 to 1977–78 and a Belgian Cup victory in 1976–77. Happel also guided Club Brugge to their first European final, reaching the 1976 UEFA Cup Final. Over the two-legged final against English giants Liverpool, Club Brugge fell 3–4 on aggregate. Two years later, Brugge again met Liverpool in a European final, this time in the 1978 European Cup Final at Wembley, becoming the first Belgian club to reach the final of the competition. Brugge fell to a lone second-half goal from Kenny Dalglish as Liverpool won their second European Cup and third European trophy in succession. Following the cup final loss to Liverpool, Happel left Club Brugge and would lead Netherlands later that summer to the final of the 1978 FIFA World Cup.

On 25 November 1992, Brugge player Daniel Amokachi became the first goal scorer in the Champions League. He scored in a 1–0 win over CSKA Moscow.

On 20 May 2021, Brugge drew 3–3 with rivals Anderlecht to win the Belgian First Division A title for the fourth time in six years and 17th time overall. It was the first time since 1973 that Club Brugge had been crowned champions at Anderlecht&#x27;s ground and the first time since 1976–77 and 1977–78 that Brugge had won back-to-back league titles. A year later, they would become champions for a third time in a row at Antwerp&#x27;s ground, the first time since 1977–79. They would go on and qualify for the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League knockout for the first time in the modern history, after losing only once and keeping 5 clean sheets in the group stage.

== Crest and colours ==

The club don a blue and black home kit as has been traditional through their history. Away from home they wear a light coloured kit. Colours like white, light blue and yellow have been used in recent years. As of the 2022–23 season, the club&#x27;s current kit supplier is Macron.


==Stadium==

The club&#x27;s original home in the Sint-Andries district of Bruges was known as the Rattenplein (rats&#x27; stadium) since it was owned by the local fox terrier club, who used it for another imported English pastime: rat baiting. This non-UEFA affiliated &#x27;sport&#x27; involved getting dogs to chase and kill rats. In 1911, the team moved to a new ground, called De Klokke (after a nearby pub), which was renamed the Albert Dyserynckstadion after the sudden death of Club Brugge chairman Albert Dyserynck.

Their current stadium, since 1975, was rebranded in honour of local butcher and revolutionary Jan Breydel in 1998. Breydel led a rising against the city&#x27;s French overlords in the 1300s. The venue – which Club Brugge share with local rivals Cercle Brugge – was previously named the Olympiastadion.

In November 2016, the club broke ground on a new training complex at Westkapelle, including four training pitches and an additional training centre for the senior squad plus the U21 and U19 teams; all in addition to the already available sports complex Molenhoek.

=== New stadium ===
Since 2007, Club Brugge has been working on developing a new stadium. Since then, there have been a number of proposed locations, but the project never really took off due to problems with ground availability and endangered animal species on the proposed grounds.

However, when a new city council and mayor were sworn into office in the city of Bruges, the project went through a rebirth. Instead of moving out of the current Jan Breydelstadium, the site on which this stadium is built will be completely reconstructed into a park with a brand new stadium next to where the current stadium is situated. Although this project has been criticised by some, it&#x27;s the furthest the club has come with a project. In October 2021 the club received their building permit. The club, the city and the Flemish government aim to have a functioning stadium by mid-2023, which will hold up to 40,116 spectators.

==Supporters==

Some of the fans are part of 62 supporter clubs in Belgium, which have more than 10,000 members. The &quot;Supportersfederatie Club Brugge KV&quot;, founded in 1967, is recognized as the official supporters club of Club Brugge. The federation is made up of 60 recognized supporters&#x27; clubs and has an elected board to steer the operation in the right direction.

In tribute to the fans, often dubbed the twelfth man in football, Club Brugge no longer assigns the number 12 to players. Club Brugge also has a TV show, CLUBtv, on the Telenet network since 21 July 2006. This twice weekly show features exclusive interviews with players, coaches and managers.

==Mascot==

The official mascot of Club Bruges is a bear, symbol of the city of Bruges. The history of the bear is related to a legend of the first Count of Flanders, Baldwin I of Flanders, who had fought and defeated a bear in his youth. Since the end of 2000, a second mascot, also a bear, travels along the edge of the field during home games for fans to call and encourage both their favorites. These two bears are called Belle and Bene. In 2010, a third bear named Bibi, made its appearance. He is described as the child of the first two mascots, and is oriented towards the young supporters.

==Rivalries==
Like many historic clubs, Club Brugge contests rivalries with other Belgian clubs, whether at local (Cercle Brugge) or regional level (Antwerp) or nationally competitive (Anderlecht and Standard Liège).

===Anderlecht===

The rivalry between Club Brugge and Anderlecht has developed since the 1970s. At that time, the Brussels-based club and Club Brugge won most trophies between them, leaving little room for other Belgian teams. Matches between these two teams were often contested for the title of champion of Belgium. Three Belgian Cup finals were played between the two clubs (with Anderlecht winning once and Club Brugge twice), and they played seven Belgian Supercups (Club Bruges won five). A match between these two sides is often called &#x27;The Hate Game&#x27;. They are arguably the most heated fixtures in Belgian football together with clashes between the other two members of the Big Three – Anderlecht and Standard Liège.

=== Cercle Brugge ===
The Bruges Derby is seen as one of the most important games of the season for a lot of fans from both teams. Every season, the game attracts a huge deal of fans which results in huge choreographies on both sides. Tifos, flags and banners made specifically for this confrontation and accompanied by flares and smoke bombs aren&#x27;t a rare sight in and around the stadium. The winner of this derby is crowned &quot;de Ploeg van Brugge&quot;&quot;,&quot; which translates to &quot;the team of Bruges&quot;. It has become a tradition for the winning side to plant a flag with the club&#x27;s crest or colours on the center spot after the game.

=== R. Antwerp FC ===
The rivalry between the oldest clubs in Flanders and Belgium, is one that dates back to the 1900s. In 1908, due to Bruges supporters attacking Antwerp players after they had lost 2–1 to what we&#x27;ll later call Club Brugge, one of the biggest and fiercest rivalries in Europe came to be. Confrontations between the two sides bring a lot of fighting and havoc to the stadium and the surrounding neighbourhoods. This hatred has reached new highs ever since Antwerp gained promotion back to the first division.

<doc id="563624" wikidata="Q18573" url="?curid=563624" title="Southern Football League">
<text>The Southern League is a football competition featuring semi-professional clubs from East Anglia, the South and Midlands of England, and South Wales. Together with the Isthmian League and the Northern Premier League it forms levels seven and eight of the English football league system.

The structure of the Southern League has changed several times since its formation in 1894, and currently there are 87 clubs which are divided into four divisions. The Central and South Divisions are at step 3 of the National League System (NLS), and are feeder divisions, mainly to the National League South but also to the National League North. Feeding the Premier Divisions are two regional divisions, Division One Central and Division One South, which are at step 4 of the NLS. These divisions are in turn fed by various regional leagues.

The league has its administrative head office at Eastgate House in Gloucester.

==History==
===Football in the south of England===
Professional football (and, indeed, professional sports in general) developed more slowly in Southern England than in Northern England. Professionalism was first sanctioned by The Football Association as early as 1885, but when The Football League was founded in 1888 its member clubs were based entirely in the North and Midlands, as the county football associations in the South were firmly opposed to professionalism.

Woolwich Arsenal (nowadays simply Arsenal) were the first club in London to turn professional in 1891 and were one of the prime motivators behind an attempt to set up a Southern League to mirror the existing Northern and Midlands based Football League. However, this venture failed in the face of opposition from the London Football Association, and Woolwich Arsenal instead joined the Football League as its only representative south of Birmingham in 1893. Additionally, an amateur league, the Southern Alliance, was founded in 1892, with seven clubs from the region, but that folded after one incomplete season.

===Formation of the Southern League===
Nonetheless, another attempt was made to form the Southern League, and this time it was successful. A competition for both professional and amateur clubs was founded in 1894 under the initiative of Millwall Athletic (now simply Millwall). Initially only one division was envisaged, but such was the enthusiasm for the idea, that eventually two divisions were formed. The sixteen original founder members were:

2nd Scots Guards withdrew before the first season started and were replaced by Southampton St Mary&#x27;s. Woolwich Arsenal attempted to add their reserve side to the second division but this application was refused due to the club&#x27;s existing membership of The Football League.

===Success of the Southern League===
The Southern League soon became the dominant competition below The Football League in Southern and Central England, and by the turn of the century a few of the Southern League sides began to seriously rival the Football League in the FA Cup. A preview of the 1900–01 season in the &quot;Daily News&quot; described the league as &quot;now, without a doubt, second only in importance and the strength of its clubs to the Football League itself. With the exception of Woolwich Arsenal, who prefer to remain members of the Second Division of the Football League, all the best professional teams in the South are now enrolled in the ranks of the Southern League&quot;.

Two Southern League clubs, Southampton (in 1900 and 1902) and Tottenham Hotspur (in 1901) reached the final of the FA Cup around the turn of the twentieth century. Tottenham Hotspur remain the only club from outside the Football League (and since its inception, also the Premier League) to have won the FA Cup.

Several of the best players in England moved from the Football League to the Southern League around this time, due to the restrictions on their freedom of movement and wages implemented by the Football League between 1893 and 1901, and the failed efforts of the Association Footballers&#x27; Union (the AFU) to relax the restrictions. This ended in 1910 when the League came to a reciprocal agreement with the Football League.

The champions of the two leagues during this period met in the annual Charity Shield. Out of the six meetings the respective league champions had in the Shield, however, only one was won by the Southern League champions – Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, in 1910, and this remains their only top level national honour. Up until World War I, the league also organised several representative &#x27;inter-league&#x27; matches, against the Football League XI and the Scottish Football League XI. They won the inaugural inter-league equivalent of the British Home Championship in 1910, defeating the Football League 3–2, Scottish League 1–0 and the Irish League 4–0.

In 1907, it accepted newly converted-to-Association and future Football League club Bradford, a northern club, as a member, reflecting its senior position at the time. Stalybridge Celtic and Stoke also joined before the First World War.

In 1920, virtually the entire top division of the Southern League was absorbed by the Football League to become that league&#x27;s new Third Division. A year later the Third Division was expanded and regionalised. The Third Division clubs from the previous season became the Third Division South, with the addition of the Third Division North.

Of the original founder members, seven – Bromley, Gillingham (formerly New Brompton), Luton Town, Millwall, Reading, Southampton and Swindon Town – went on to be Football League clubs.

===1920-1979: an unofficial feeder league===
For the next six decades, the Football League and Southern League would occasionally exchange a limited number of clubs as a result of the older league&#x27;s re-election process. From 1920 onward, the Southern League&#x27;s status as a semi-professional league was firmly established. In 1977, Wimbledon became the last Southern League club to successfully achieve election into the Football League.

===1979 onwards: incorporation into Non-League pyramid system===
With its clubs seeking a more regular means of advancing to the Football League, in 1979 the Southern League became a feeder to the new Alliance Premier League along with the Isthmian League and the Northern Premier League, and the top Southern clubs of the day joined the new league. In turn, the APL (renamed Football Conference in 1986 and National League in 2015) would eventually succeed in becoming a feeder to the Football League. The league lost more of its top clubs in 2004 when the Conference added two regional divisions below the existing National League, the Conference South and Conference North.

In May 2017, the FA chose the Southern League to add an additional division at step 3 as part of another restructuring in the NLS; the two Premier Divisions were set at 22 clubs each. The new Central Division started playing in the 2018–19 season.

===Sponsorship===
The first sponsor of the Southern League was Beazer Homes who sponsored the league from 1987 to 1996. The sponsors after Beazer Homes to the present day are: Dr Martens (1996–2004), British Gas (2006–2009), Zamaretto (2009–2011), Evo-Stik (2011–2013), Calor Gas (2013–2014), Evo-Stik (2014–2019) and BetVictor (2019–2020). From the 2020–21 season the league has been sponsored by Pitching In, Entain&#x27;s grassroots sports investment programme. At the time of announcement, Entain went by its former name GVC Holdings. Under this partnership, the Southern League is marketed as one of the three Trident Leagues, alongside its Isthmian and Northern Premier counterparts.

==Champions==
This section lists the past winners of the Southern League. Winners to 1993 source:

&quot;For the 1898–99 season, Division Two was divided into London and South-West sections, with a playoff contested between the winners of each section.&quot;

&quot;For the 1899–1900 season, the league reverted to the old format, after all the members of the South-West section resigned.&quot;

&quot;For the 1909–10 season, Division Two was split into an &#x27;A&#x27; section and a &#x27;B&#x27; section, with the winners of each section contesting a play-off for the Division Two championship.&quot;

&quot;For the 1910–11 season, the league again reverted to the previous format.&quot;

&quot;At the end of the 1919–20 season, the majority of the clubs in the First Division moved into the new Third Division of the Football League. The Southern League was therefore split into two sections for England and Wales, with the winners of each section contesting a playoff for the Southern League championship.&quot;

&quot;For the 1923–24 season, the league was split into two regional sections, with the winners of each section contesting a playoff for the Southern League championship.&quot;

&quot;For the 1933–34 season an extra section, the Central Section was introduced to provide additional fixtures. The Central included clubs from the other two sections and did not contribute to the overall championship.&quot;

&quot;For the 1936–37 season, the Eastern and Western sections were merged into a single division. Additional fixtures were obtained through the Midweek Section which did not contribute to the overall championship.&quot;

&quot;For the 1945–46 season, the Midweek Section was not played due to power restrictions after World War II.&quot;

&quot;For the 1958–59 season the Southern League was again divided into two sections: North-Western and South-Eastern. The winners of each section contested a playoff for the Southern League championship.&quot;

&quot;The following season saw the two sections merged to form a Premier Division, and a new Division One introduced.&quot;

&quot;For the 1971–72 season Division One was regionalised.&quot;

&quot;For the 1979–80 season, thirteen Premier Division clubs joined the newly formed Alliance Premier League. The Premier Division and Division One were subsequently merged, and two regional divisions formed.&quot;

&quot;For the 1982–83 season, the Premier Division was re-introduced, above the regional divisions.&quot;

&quot;For the 1999–2000 season, the regional divisions were renamed the Eastern and Western divisions.&quot;

&quot;For the 2006–07 season, the two regional divisions were renamed Division One Midlands and Division One South &amp; West.&quot;

&quot;For the 2009–10 season, Division One Midlands was renamed Division One Central.&quot;

&quot;For the 2017–18 season, the Central and South &amp; West divisions were renamed back into East and West respectively.&quot;

&quot;For the following season, the Premier Division was regionalised, becoming the South Division, and a Central Division was added. The East and West divisions were realigned into Central and South again.&quot;


===Promoted===
Since the league&#x27;s formation in 1894, the following clubs have won promotion to higher levels of the English football league system -


Asterisk indicates club was promoted via play-offs

==League Cup winners==


==League structure==
The league structure has changed several times over the years and currently consists of Central and South Divisions at step 3 of the National League System with Division One South and Division One Central at step 4.

Due in large part to the presence of the Isthmian League, the geographical footprint of the Southern League actually extends further north than the National League South. Therefore, while the winners of the Central and South Divisions are promoted to the National League South, those clubs in the most northerly locales are promoted to the National League North. In the past, the majority of the winners of the former Premier Division, together with the winners of a playoff, were promoted to the higher league.

Clubs relegated from the Southern League can theoretically be placed in any of fourteen lower-level leagues, but in practice it is likely to be one of the following (based on geography):

*Combined Counties League
*Hellenic League
*Midland Football League
*Spartan South Midlands League
*United Counties League
*Wessex League
*Western League

From time to time, clubs outside the promotion and relegation positions based at the geographical edges of the Southern League will be compelled to leave the League by the NLS Committee, should it be necessary for them to compete in the Northern Premier League or Isthmian League so as to correct any imbalances brought on by the geographical distribution of the clubs promoted and relegated to this level. Clubs in the Northern Premier League or Isthmian League have also been entered into the Southern League for the same reason. In general, there has been a drift southwards, with clubs in the Midlands moving into the Northern Premier League.

<doc id="563628" wikidata="Q853854" url="?curid=563628" title="Clock tower">
<text>Clock towers are a specific type of structure that house a turret clock and have one or more clock faces on the upper exterior walls. Many clock towers are freestanding structures but they can also adjoin or be located on top of another building. Some other buildings also have clock faces on their exterior but these structures serve other main functions.

Clock towers are a common sight in many parts of the world with some being iconic buildings. One example is the Elizabeth Tower in London (usually called &quot;Big Ben&quot;, although strictly this name belongs only to the bell inside the tower).

==Definition==

There are many structures that may have clocks or clock faces attached to them and some structures have had clocks added to an existing structure. According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat a structure is defined as a building if at least fifty percent of its height is made up of floor plates containing habitable floor area. Structures that do not meet this criterion, are defined as towers. A clock tower historically fits this definition of a tower and therefore can be defined as any tower specifically built with one or more (often four) clock faces and that can be either freestanding or part of a church or municipal building such as a town hall. Not all clocks on buildings therefore make the building into a clock tower.

The mechanism inside the tower is known as a turret clock. It often marks the hour (and sometimes segments of an hour) by sounding large bells or chimes, sometimes playing simple musical phrases or tunes. Some clock towers were previously built as Bell towers and then had clocks added to them. As these structures fulfil the definition of a tower they can be considered to be clock towers.

==History==

Although clock towers are today mostly admired for their aesthetics, they once served an important purpose. Before the middle of the twentieth century, most people did not have watches, and prior to the 18th century even home clocks were rare. The first clocks did not have faces, but were solely striking clocks, which sounded bells to call the surrounding community to work or to prayer. They were therefore placed in towers so the bells would be audible for a long distance. Clock towers were placed near the centres of towns and were often the tallest structures there. As clock towers became more common, the designers realized that a dial on the outside of the tower would allow the townspeople to read the time whenever they wanted.

The use of clock towers dates back to antiquity. The earliest clock tower was the Tower of the Winds in Athens, which featured eight sundials and was created in the 1st century BC during the period of Roman Greece. In its interior, there was also a water clock (or clepsydra), driven by water coming down from the Acropolis.

In Song dynasty China, an astronomical clock tower was designed by Su Song and erected at Kaifeng in 1088, featuring a liquid escapement mechanism. In England, a clock was put up in a clock tower, the medieval precursor to Big Ben, at Westminster, in 1288; and in 1292 a clock was put up in Canterbury Cathedral. The oldest surviving turret clock formerly part of a clock tower in Europe is the Salisbury Cathedral clock, completed in 130. A clock put up at St. Albans, in 1326, &#x27;showed various astronomical phenomena&#x27;.

Al-Jazari of the Artuqid dynasty in Upper Mesopotamia constructed an elaborate clock called the &quot;castle clock&quot; and described it in his &quot;Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot; in 1206. It was about high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar paths, and a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon that travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour. It was possible to re-program the length of day and night daily in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year, and it also featured five robotic musicians who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel.

Line (mains) synchronous tower clocks were introduced in the United States in the 1920s.

==Landmarks==
Some clock towers have become famous landmarks. Prominent examples include Elizabeth Tower built in 1859, which houses the Great Bell (generally known as &quot;Big Ben&quot;) in London, the tower of Philadelphia City Hall, the Rajabai Tower in Mumbai, the Spasskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin, the Torre dell&#x27;Orologio in the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy, the Peace Tower of the Parliament of Canada in Ottawa, and the Zytglogge clock tower in the Old City of Bern, Switzerland.

==Records==

The tallest freestanding clock tower in the world is the Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower (Old Joe) at the University of Birmingham in Birmingham, United Kingdom. The tower stands at tall and was completed in 1908. The clock tower of Philadelphia City Hall was part of the tallest building in the world from 1894, when the tower was topped out and the building partially occupied, until 1908.

Taller buildings have had clock faces added to their existing structure such as the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, with a clock added in 2000. The building has a roof height of , and an antenna height of . The NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building in Tokyo, with a clock added in 2002, has a roof height of , and an antenna height of .

The Abraj Al Bait, a hotel complex in Mecca constructed in 2012, has the largest and highest clock face on a building in the world, with its Makkah Royal Clock Tower having an occupied height of , and a tip height of . The tower has four clock faces, two of which are in diameter, at about high.

<text>The American Paint Horse is a breed of horse that combines both the conformational characteristics of a western stock horse with a pinto spotting pattern of white and dark coat colors. Developed from a base of spotted horses with Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred bloodlines, the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) breed registry is now one of the largest in North America. The registry allows some non-spotted animals to be registered as &quot;Solid Paint Bred&quot; and considers the American Paint Horse to be a horse breed with distinct characteristics, not merely a color breed.

==Registration==
The American Paint Horse&#x27;s combination of color and conformation has made the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) the second-largest breed registry in the United States. While the colorful coat pattern is essential to the identity of the breed, American Paint Horses have strict bloodline requirements and a distinctive stock-horse body type. To be eligible for registry, a Paint&#x27;s sire and dam must be registered with the American Paint Horse Association, the American Quarter Horse Association, or the Jockey Club (Thoroughbreds). At least one of the parents must be a registered American Paint Horse. There are two categories of registration, regular, for horses with color, and solid Paint-bred, for those without color.

===Regular APHA registration===

In addition to bloodlines, to be eligible for the Regular Registry of the American Paint Horse Association (APHA), the horse must also exhibit a &quot;natural paint marking&quot;, meaning either a predominant hair coat color with at least one contrasting area of solid white hair of the required size with some underlying unpigmented skin present on the horse at the time of its birth. Or, in the case of a predominantly white hair coat, at least one contrasting area of the required size of colored hair with some underlying pigmented skin present on the horse. Natural Paint markings usually must cover more than two inches and be located in certain designated areas of the body.

===Solid Paint-Bred ===

Solid colored offspring of two registered Paint parents, called &quot;Solid Paint-Breds&quot; or &quot;Breeding Stock Paints,&quot; are also eligible for registration, with certain restrictions. They are able to participate in some recognized Paint breed shows, and there are alternative programs offered, and many incentive programs within the registry are available to Solid Paint-bred horses. If a solid-colored horse is bred to a regular registry Paint horse, it is possible to produce a spotted foal. In some cases, such as the recessive sabino patterns, described below, even a solid colored horse may still carry genes for color. However, in the case of the dominant tobiano pattern, a Breeding Stock Paint will not carry these color genes, though it may retain other desirable traits.

==Color==

Each Paint Horse has a particular combination of white and another color of the equine spectrum. Most common are horses with white spots combined with black, bay, brown, and chestnut or sorrel. Less common are horses with spot colors influenced by dilution genes such as palomino, buckskin, cremello, perlino, pearl or &quot;Barlink factor&quot;, and champagne, various shades of roan, or various shades of dun, including grullo. Paints may also carry the gray gene and have spots that eventually fade to white hair, though retaining pigmented skin underneath the areas that were once dark.

Spots can be any shape or size, except leopard complex patterning, which is characteristic of the Appaloosa, and located virtually anywhere on the Paint&#x27;s body. Although Paints come in a variety of colors with different markings and different underlying genetics, these are grouped into only four defined coat patterns: overo (includes frame, splash and sabino), tobiano and tovero and solid.

Breeding Stock Paints can sometimes showcase small color traits, particularly if they carry sabino genetics. Such traits include blue eyes, pink skin on lips and nostrils, roan spots, and minimal roaning.

===Terms for color patterns defined===

*Tobiano: The most common spotting pattern, characterized by rounded markings with white legs and white across the back between the withers and the dock of the tail, usually arranged in a roughly vertical pattern and more white than dark, with the head usually dark and with markings like that of a normal horse. i.e. star, snip, strip, or blaze. 
*Overo: A group of spotting patterns characterized by sharp, irregular markings with a horizontal orientation, usually more dark than white, though the face is usually white, sometimes with blue eyes. The white rarely crosses the back, and the lower legs are normally dark. The APHA recognizes three overo patterns:
**Frame: The most familiar overo pattern, the gene for frame has been genetically mapped and in the homozygous form, results in Lethal White Syndrome (LWS). Visually identified frames have no health defects connected to their color, and are characterized by ragged, sharp white patches on the sides of the body, leaving a &quot;frame&quot; of non-white color that typically includes the topline.
**Sabino: Often confused with roan or rabicano, sabino is a slight spotting pattern characterized by high white on legs, belly spots, white markings on the face extending past the eyes and/or patches of roaning patterns standing alone or on the edges of white markings.
**Splashed white: The least common spotting pattern, splashed whites typically have blue eyes and crisp, smooth, blocky white markings that almost always include the head and legs. The tail is often white or white-tipped, and body markings originate under the belly and extend &quot;upwards&quot;.
*Tovero: spotting pattern that is a mix of tobiano and overo coloration, such as blue eyes on a dark head. 
*Solid: A horse otherwise eligible for registration as a Paint that does not have any white that constitutes a recognized spotting pattern.
*&quot;Color&quot;: An informal term meaning that the horse has a spotting pattern. (The opposite of &quot;Solid.&quot;)
*&quot;Chrome&quot;: An informal term of approval used in some geographic regions to describe a particularly flashy spotting pattern.
*Pintaloosa: An informal term used to describe the color of a horse that has been crossbred between an American Paint and an Appaloosa. 

===Paint or Pinto?===
The terms &quot;paint&quot; and &quot;pinto&quot; are sometimes both used to describe paint horses. The breed is specifically called &quot;Paint&quot;, and &quot;pinto&quot; actually refers to the color.

==History==

The American Paint Horse shares a common ancestry with the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred. A registered Paint horse should conform to the same &quot;stock horse&quot; body type desired in Quarter Horses: a muscular animal that is heavy but not too tall, with a low center of gravity for maneuverability, and powerful hindquarters suitable for rapid acceleration and sprinting.

When the American Quarter Horse Association emerged in 1940 to preserve horses of the &quot;stock&quot; type, it excluded those with pinto coat patterns and &quot;crop out&quot; horses, those born with white body spots or white above the knees and hocks. Undeterred, fans of colorful stock horses formed a variety of organizations to preserve and promote Paint horses. In 1965 some of these groups merged to form the American Paint Horse Association.

==Uses==
The Paint Horse is used in a variety of equestrian disciplines, most commonly Western pleasure, reining, barrel racing, and other Western events, although it is also ridden English in hunt seat or show jumping competition.

==Genetic problems==

One medical issue associated with the breed is the genetic disease lethal white syndrome (LWS). Also called Overo lethal white syndrome (OLWS) or, less often, white foal syndrome (WFS), it is linked to a recessive gene associated with the frame overo pattern. Horses that are heterozygous carriers of the gene do not develop the condition and are physically healthy. However, when a foal is born that is homozygous for the LWS gene, it should be humanely euthanized shortly after birth, or else will die within a few days from complications involving an underdeveloped intestinal tract. A DNA test is available for LWS so that horses who are carriers of this gene are not bred to one another. Horses can carry the LWS gene and not visibly exhibit overo coloring; cases have appeared in the offspring of both tobiano and solid-colored parents, though all cases to date are horses that had overo ancestors. LWS is also not unique to Paint Horses; it can occur in any equine breed where the frame overo coat pattern is found.

Due to the heavy influx of American Quarter Horse breeding, some Paints may also carry genetic disorders such as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA), equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (called PSSM – polysaccharide storage myopathy – in Paints, Quarter Horses and Appaloosas), malignant hyperthermia (MH) and glycogen branching enzyme deficiency (GBED). The influence of Thoroughbred breeding puts some bloodlines at higher risk for Wobbler&#x27;s syndrome.

He was one of the first backers of an American transcontinental railway. A trip to China in 1842–44 impressed upon Whitney the need for a transcontinental railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

When Whitney returned to the United States in 1844, he realized the benefits from such an undertaking, and spent a great deal of money trying to get the Congress to take up the project. In 1849, he published A Project for a Railroad to the Pacific. For years he continued to write revised memorials and take expeditions through what was then known as Indian Territory to support his cause.

Later Whitney&#x27;s dream was realized through the efforts of Theodore Judah. In the end, Whitney lived to see his dream realized in 1869 with the opening of the Union Pacific.

== Early life ==
Asa Whitney was born on March 14, 1797, in North Groton, Connecticut. His parents were Sarah Mitchell and Shubael Whitney. He is distantly related to Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin. They were fifth cousins. For five generations, the Whitney family had been farmers. However, from a young age, Asa Whitney showed no interest in agriculture and wanted to be a merchant.

== Career ==
He went to New York in his late teens to chase his dream of being a merchant. He began as a clerk, working for a huge importer of French goods. He was promoted, and, by 1832, he was a successful dry-goods merchant.

== Marriage ==
While he was abroad in France in 1832, he married a French girl, Herminie Antoinette Pillet. However, just a mere year after they met, she died on March 31, 1833. She was buried in New Rochelle, very close to where Asa had planned to start a family with her. He married again to Sarah Jay Munro, a daughter of Peter Jay Munro. She died on November 12, 1840. This may have been a miscarriage or an unsuccessful childbirth. She was buried next to Asa’s first wife. In 1852, Whitney married Mrs. Catherine (Moore) Campbell of Wilmington, N.C. She outlived her husband by six years and is buried beside him in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington, D.C.

== Trip to China ==
After his second wife died, his property in New York faced foreclosure and was put up for auction. Whitney was only given $10,000 for his property. He sold the rest of his land and drew his interests toward China. On June 18, 1842, he set sail to China on his ship, the Oscar. The Oscar was loaded down with a lot of goods which resulted in the ship moving very slowly. The voyage to China usually took around 100 days, and newer ships could make the trip in as short as 79 days. However, Whitney’s trip took 153 days, a record slowness for the year. Whitney became very angry during this trip and he was apt to having rages and temper tantrums. He arrived in China during the Opium Wars, which was a dispute between the British and the Chinese. After the dispute died down, many other nations began to trade with China, and Whitney became one of a few Americans who helped with the exportation of teas, spices, and other goods. His profits began piling up. By the time he left China, he had enough money to retire. His time in China lasted a year and four months, and he headed back home on April 2, 1844. His trip back was also very long and tedious.

== Attempts at a Transcontinental Railroad ==
On the way back from China, Asa Whitney began devising a plan that would make the trip to China much easier. He wanted to build a railroad across the United States. People on the East coast could take the train to the West coast, and then take a ship from there to China. It would greatly shorten the long trip. When he arrived back in the United States, he was full of inspiration and drive and he got straight to work. He bought property in upstate New York and began working on a memorial to Congress about his plan for a railroad. His plan was mainly focused on trade with China, and connecting the two countries for increased culture, immigration, and commerce. He believed that the railroad would open trade to all of Asia, and unite the continents. He spent a great amount of time and money to try to promote his plan, and he explored a lot of the routes that he considered. He wrote A Project for a Railroad to the Pacific, a memorial to the United States Congress, in 1849. His plan was detailed and impressive, but he was denied. He continued trying to create the railroad, taking surveys and examining potential routes. He wanted to create a route that went way up north to the Puget Sound. However, no matter how hard he tried, his plan was never accepted, and he stopped campaigning in 1851.

== Death ==
Asa Whitney lived long enough to see his dream become a reality; he was alive when the first transcontinental railroad was completed. He died in 1872, three years after the golden spike was laid, of typhoid fever.

== Legacy ==
Although Whitney’s plan fell through, word began spreading of the idea of a transcontinental railroad. His plan inspired many young, ambitious engineers, one of which being Theodore Judah, a man who helped make the dream of a transcontinental railroad into a reality.

Whitney Avenue (later renamed Park Road) in Washington, D.C., was named after Whitney.

<text>John Marc DeMatteis (; born December 15, 1953) is an American writer of comic books, television and novels.

==Biography==

===Early career===
J. M. DeMatteis&#x27;s earliest aspirations were to be a rock musician and comic book artist. He began playing in bands starting in the sixth grade, generally in the role of lead singer, songwriter and rhythm guitarist, and also wrote music reviews for a number of publications. He began drawing at a young age, and was accepted into the School of the Visual Arts. DeMatteis recalled, &quot;...for some reason, I think it was financial, I ended up not going. Somewhere after that what little drawing skills I had began to atrophy.&quot; He graduated from Midwood High School in Brooklyn in 1971.

DeMatteis then turned from drawing to writing. He got his start in comic books at DC Comics in the late 1970s. After a number of rejected submissions, his first accepted story was &quot;The Lady-Killer Craves Blood&quot;, but it would not be published until years later in &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #282 (July 1980). His first published story for the company was &quot;The Blood Boat!&quot; in &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; #70 (Dec. 1978). He contributed to the company&#x27;s line of horror comics notably with the creation of the Creature Commandos in &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; #93 (Nov. 1980) and I…Vampire in &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #290 (March 1981). He briefly wrote the Aquaman feature in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; as well. DeMatteis and artist Brian Bolland produced a backup story titled &quot;Falling Down to Heaven&quot; in &quot;Madame Xanadu&quot;, DC&#x27;s first attempt at marketing comics specifically to the &quot;direct market&quot; of fans and collectors. DeMatteis had long been eager to work for Marvel Comics, and following roughly a year in which editor-in-chief Jim Shooter kept him busy with odd jobs and fill-ins, in 1980 he was made the lead writer for Marvel on &quot;The Defenders&quot;, and had lengthy runs on &quot;Captain America&quot;, paired with penciler Mike Zeck, and &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;.

===1980s===
After writing a negative review of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Go to Heaven&quot; which was published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, DeMatteis ended his career as a music critic. He explained, &quot;Grateful Dead fans are like hardcore comic book fans, you know... and I know that when I sit down to write a review that I&#x27;m just some shmuck sitting down at a typewriter with an opinion—but then it&#x27;s in print in something like &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. I got all these letters, which I saved, from all these hardcore Grateful Dead fans—wounded. ... I said if I&#x27;m gonna review at all I&#x27;m not gonna write negative reviews anymore...&quot; Around this time he also surrendered his professional career as a rock musician, after years of playing in New York City–based bands.

In 1984, DeMatteis and artist Bob Budiansky produced a &quot;Prince Namor&quot; limited series. He saw the series as an opportunity to both delve more into the psychology of the title character than he had been able to in &quot;The Defenders&quot; and to continue his collaboration with Budiansky from the recently canceled &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, later recalling, &quot;We&#x27;d get on the phone, start talking, and the stories would come so easily. We had a fantastic rapport, personally and professionally.&quot; DeMatteis had mixed feelings about the series itself, and said the one part of which he was unreservedly proud was the look into Namor&#x27;s years as an amnesiac homeless man. DeMatteis and illustrator Jon J. Muth created the graphic novel &quot;Moonshadow&quot;, for Marvel&#x27;s Epic line: the groundbreaking story was the first fully painted series in American comics. DeMatteis followed this with the 1986 Doctor Strange graphic novel &quot;Into Shamballa&quot; drawn by Dan Green and &quot;&quot;, a hallucinatory vampire story drawn by Kent Williams. In 1987, DeMatteis and Zeck re-teamed for the &quot;Kraven&#x27;s Last Hunt&quot; arc that ran throughout Marvel&#x27;s then-three Spider-Man titles. The arc has been collected in multiple editions and remains one of the most popular, and respected, stories in Spider-Man&#x27;s history.
Moving back to DC, DeMatteis succeeded Gerry Conway as writer of the superhero-team title &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. He used the pen name Michael Ellis on his first issue of the series. When that title was cancelled in the wake of the company-wide crossover &quot;Legends&quot;, DeMatteis stayed through its relaunch as &quot;Justice League International&quot;, scripting over the plots of Keith Giffen.

&quot;JLI&quot; took such lesser-known DC characters as Martian Manhunter, Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Mister Miracle, Captain Atom, and Power Girl and turned the then-current preoccupation with &quot;grim &#x27;n&#x27; gritty&quot; superheroes on its head. The lighthearted series emphasized the absurd aspects of people with strange powers, wearing colorful costumes, volunteering to fight evildoers. Although the League had its serious side and often faced world-threatening villains, the stories included such characters as the lovably inept G&#x27;nort, the worst Green Lantern in the Green Lantern Corps, Mr. Nebula, the interplanetary decorator, the Injustice League, a bunch of bumbling losers and a flock of homicidal penguins who had been hybridized with piranhas. The success of &quot;Justice League International&quot; led to a spin-off in 1989 titled &quot;Justice League Europe&quot; also co-written with Giffen and featuring art by Bart Sears.

===1990s===
The Giffen/DeMatteis team worked on &quot;Justice League&quot; for five years and closed out their run with the &quot;Breakdowns&quot; storyline in 1991 and 1992. DeMatteis scripted &quot;Justice League&quot; spin-offs such as solo series for Mister Miracle and Doctor Fate.

Back at Marvel, DeMatteis again succeeded Conway, this time as writer of &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; in 1991, taking the series in a grimmer, more psychologically oriented direction. In collaboration with regular artist Sal Buscema, DeMatteis&#x27; story arc &quot;The Child Within&quot; (#178–184) featured the return of the Harry Osborn Green Goblin. Spider-Man&#x27;s battle with the Goblin continued in &quot;The Osborn Legacy&quot; in #189 and came to an end when Harry died in &quot;The Best Of Enemies!&quot; (#200).

In 1994, DeMatteis took over from David Michelinie as writer of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #389–406 for a run that included the apparent death of Peter Parker&#x27;s Aunt May and the beginnings of the &quot;Clone Saga&quot; arc. DeMatteis as well worked on such characters as Doctor Strange, Daredevil, Man-Thing, and the Silver Surfer.

DeMatteis helped launch DC&#x27;s mature-audience Vertigo imprint, writing the graphic novels &quot;Mercy&quot; and &quot;Farewell, Moonshadow&quot; (a sequel to the Epic Comics series), the miniseries &quot;The Last One&quot;, and the 15-issue series &quot;Seekers Into The Mystery&quot;, the story of a Hollywood screenwriter on a journey of self-discovery and the search for universal truths.
DeMatteis wrote an autobiographical, digest-sized miniseries &quot;Brooklyn Dreams&quot;, published by DC&#x27;s Paradox Press imprint. DeMatteis&#x27; most personal work, it was later collected in one volume under the Vertigo imprint.

===21st century===
In the 2000s, DeMatteis redefined the Spectre, through the character of Hal Jordan, as a spirit of redemption rather than of vengeance. DeMatteis co-scripted the &quot;Gods of Gotham&quot; storyline in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #164–166 (January to March 2001) with Phil Jimenez. In 2003, with Giffen, he revived the Justice League International for the mini-series &quot;Formerly Known as the Justice League&quot;. The series won Giffen, DeMatteis and artist Kevin Maguire an Eisner Award. The team followed this with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not the Justice League&quot; arc in &quot;JLA Classified&quot; and, at Marvel, a five-issue run of &quot;The Defenders&quot;. In 2006, DeMatteis and Giffen began work on two original superhero comedy series, &quot;Hero Squared&quot; and &quot;Planetary Brigade&quot; for Boom! Studios. DeMatteis teamed with veteran artist Mike Ploog to create the CrossGen fantasy comic &quot;Abadazad&quot; (May 2004). The following year, Ploog and DeMatteis announced they were collaborating on a five-issue miniseries, &quot;Stardust Kid&quot;, from the Image Comics imprint Desperado Publishing. The series moved to Boom! Studios in 2006.

The Walt Disney Company acquired &quot;Abadazad&quot; for its Hyperion Books for Children imprint. The first two books in the series—&quot;Abadazad: The Road to Inconceivable&quot; and &quot;Abadazad: The Dream Thief&quot;—were released June 2006. The third book—&quot;Abadazad: The Puppet, The Professor and The Prophet&quot;—was released in the United Kingdom in 2007.

In June 2010, DeMatteis&#x27;s children&#x27;s fantasy novel, &quot;Imaginalis&quot;, was published by Katherine Tegen Books, an imprint of HarperCollins.

In 2008, DeMatteis became editor-in-chief of Ardden Entertainment, guiding the launch of a new &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic book series. In 2009, he wrote a five-issue comic book limited series, illustrated by Mike Cavallaro, &quot;The Life and Times of Savior 28&quot;, which was released by IDW Publishing in 2009. He also wrote the Metal Men back-up story in the new &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; and returned to Marvel Comics for a number of new Spider-Man stories. In 2010, DeMatteis reunited once again with frequent collaborator Keith Giffen for a run on the comic book series &quot;Booster Gold&quot;. The two teamed on the &quot;DC Retroactive: JLA – The &#x27;90s&quot; one-shot in October 2011. Also in 2011, DeMatteis created the all-ages fantasy &quot;The Adventures of Augusta Wind&quot; for IDW Publishing. In 2013, he took over DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; and launched the 12-issue &quot;Larfleeze&quot; series with Giffen. DeMatteis became the writer of &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; in October 2013 and, again with Giffen, launched &quot;Justice League 3000&quot; in December.

In 2015, DeMatteis worked with Bruce Timm for &quot;Justice League: Gods and Monsters,&quot; a comic book prequel to the film. In 2016, Giffen and DeMatteis launched &quot;Scooby Apocalypse&quot; for DC—a more adult reimagining of the classic cartoon—and IDW published DeMatteis&#x27;s &quot;Augusta Wind&quot; sequel &quot;The Adventures of Augusta Wind: The Last Story.&quot; 2018 saw the release of the IDW series &quot;Impossible, Incorporated,&quot; with another new creator-owned series, &quot;The Girl in the Bay,&quot; from Berger Books, announced for 2019. In 2021, Marvel announced a new limited series titled &quot;Ben Reilly: Spider-Man&quot; written by DeMatteis with art by David Baldeón, released in 2022. The same year, Marvel announced the forthcoming series &quot;Spider-Man: The Lost Hunt,&quot; which ties in to DeMatteis&#x27; Spider-Man classic, &quot;Kraven&#x27;s Last Hunt.&quot; Also in 2022, DeMatteis, in collaboration with Spellbound Comics, launched The DeMultiverse, four new series written by DeMatteis and illustrated by Shawn McManus, Tom Mandrake, Matthew Dow Smith, and David Baldeon. He also published a novel, the supernatural thriller, &quot;The Excavator,&quot; followed the next year by another supernatural novel, &quot;The Witness.&quot; 

In 2024, Marvel published a new Spider-Man series, &quot;Shadow of the Green Goblin,&quot; and DC launched the Batman mini-series &quot;Robin Lives!&quot; DeMatteis and Spellbound Comics also launched Phase II of their DeMultiverse titles on Kickstarter.

==== Spellbound Comics ====
In October 2022, DeMatteis announced the founding of his own publisher named Spellbound Comics. Through a Kickstarter campaign, he presented the DeMultiverse, a collection of four &quot;pilot issues&quot; of comics titled &quot;Anyman,&quot; &quot;Godsend, Layla in the Lands of After&quot; and &quot;Wisdom&quot;. In November, he presented a fifth series titled &quot;The Edward Gloom Mysteries&quot;. The second wave of DeMatteis&#x27;s Spellbound series launched on Kickstarter in the summer of 2024, offering second chapters of all the DeMultiverse titles, with more planned for the future. 

===Other media===
DeMatteis has also written for television, having scripted episodes of the 1980s incarnation of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, the syndicated series &quot;The Adventures of Superboy&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as for the animated series &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ben 10: Ultimate Alien&quot;, &quot;Sym-Bionic Titan&quot;, &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; and &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man&quot;. DeMatteis also wrote the 2015 animated DTV movie &quot;Batman vs. Robin&quot; and its 2016 sequel, &quot;&quot;. The same year, DeMatteis wrote multiple episodes of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!&quot;. In 2017, DeMatteis co-wrote &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; and, in 2018, he wrote the spin-off animated series &quot;&quot;. The same year he wrote animated shorts starring Adam Strange and Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; character, Death. In 2020 DeMatteis wrote &quot;,&quot; as well as the animated adaptation of the graphic novel &quot;.&quot; In 2024, he wrote an episode of Amazon&#x27;s &quot;&quot; series, which will be part of the show&#x27;s upcoming second season.

Also a musician, DeMatteis released one album in the late 1990s, &quot;How Many Lifetimes?&quot;.
