<text>BBC Children&#x27;s and Education is the BBC division responsible for media content for children in the UK. Since the launch of specially dedicated television channels in 2002, the services have been marketed under two brands. CBBC (short for Children&#x27;s BBC or initialed for Children&#x27;s British Broadcasting Corporation) is aimed at children aged between 6 and 12, and CBeebies offers content for younger viewers.

Unlike CBeebies, the CBBC brand predates the launch of these channels all the way back to when it was just a children&#x27;s block on the main channel BBC, when it was also the brand name used for all of the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s programmes. CBBC broadcasts from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm (previously 7:00 am to 9:00 pm from 16 April 2016 until 4 January 2022) and CBeebies broadcasts from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm, respectively timesharing with BBC Three for CBBC and BBC Four for CBeebies. The brands also have dedicated websites, social media channels, and over-the-top media services on BBC iPlayer.

==History==
=== 1930–1952 ===
The BBC has produced and broadcast television programmes for children since the 1930s. The first children-specific strand on BBC was &quot;For the Children&quot;, first broadcast on what was then the single &#x27;BBC Television Service&#x27; on Saturday 24 April 1937; it was only ten minutes long. It lasted for two years before being taken off air when the service closed due to the Second World War in September 1939.

Following the war, &quot;For the Children&quot; recommenced on Sunday 7 July 1946, with a 20-minute slot every Sunday afternoon and the addition of programmes for preschool children under the banner &quot;For The Very Young&quot;, and over the years they became an established feature of the early afternoons on the BBC&#x27;s main channel BBC1.

=== 1952–1964 ===
In 1952, the &quot;For the Children&quot; / &quot;For the Very Young&quot; branding was dropped; older children&#x27;s programmes were introduced by regular continuity announcers, while younger children&#x27;s programming was broadcast under the &quot;Watch with Mother&quot; banner.

Significant series for older children that began in the 1950s included &quot;The Sooty Show&quot; and &quot;Blue Peter&quot;.

=== 1964–1985 ===
The 1964 launch of BBC2 allowed additional room for young children&#x27;s programming. On 21 April 1964, &quot;Play School&quot; became its first official programme after a power outage meant the opening night launch programmes were never broadcast.

Away from the screen, in 1964, the Children&#x27;s department was briefly amalgamated with Women&#x27;s Programmes to form Family Programmes until it was reinstated in 1967. Around this time, the production offices moved to the newly developed BBC Television Centre in White City with most offices being based in the East Tower where they remained until its closure in 2011.

Other significant series that began in the 1960s include &quot;The Clangers&quot; and in 1965, the long running story telling format, &quot;Jackanory&quot;.

Significant series that began in the 1970s included the long-running children&#x27;s news service, &quot;Newsround&quot;. In 1975, The &quot;Watch with Mother&quot; branding was dropped. In 1976, Saturday Morning television began in earnest with the launch of &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot;. In 1978, &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, a contemporary drama series set in a comprehensive school, began.

Roger Gale, later an MP for the Conservative Party, was head of children&#x27;s television from 1976 to 1979.

Significant series that began in the 1980s include &quot;Postman Pat&quot;. On 1 October 1980, &quot;See-Saw&quot; was launched (&quot;Watch with Mother&quot; branding having ended in 1975), which was moved to BBC2 in June 1987, before ending in 1990.

In 1983, a Diamond Jubilee Festival Exhibition commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of BBC Children&#x27;s Programmes at the Langham Hotel in London. The exhibition then moved to the Liverpool Garden Festival in 1984.

=== 1985–2002 ===
Until 1985, children&#x27;s programmes on BBC1 were introduced by the usually off-screen continuity announcer, though often specially-designed menus and captions would be used. In September of that year, the block rebranded as Children&#x27;s BBC, and for the first time had a dedicated Children&#x27;s BBC logo. It was described in a BBC press release as, &quot;a new package of programmes specially gift-wrapped for children.&quot; Early graphics and idents were generated by a BBC Micro computer, with which the BBC had been increasingly been experimenting with and utilising in their children&#x27;s programming continuity for a year or so prior to the rebrand.

The most significant change was that the continuity announcer was seen on screen (in-vision). Rather than use the existing BBC1 announcer, a new presenter was selected. The launch presenter was Phillip Schofield, presenting the slot for the first time at 15:55 BST on 9 September 1985. Remaining in the small continuity booth at Television Centre, during the first few days of these broadcasts, Schofield began to refer to the space as &quot;The Broom Cupboard&quot;, due to its very small size, and supposedly due to the BBC only sparing a small broom cupboard for him to host from. This quickly became an established name for the space, even appearing in billings as such. A list of CBBC presenters shows that many more followed and this style of presentation continued and remains on the CBBC channel as of 2021.

During the 1990s, Children&#x27;s BBC began to be informally referred to on-air as CBBC (this occurred at around the same time that ITV&#x27;s rival service Children&#x27;s ITV began to be referred to as CITV in a similar manner). The official billing name and on-air branding of Children&#x27;s BBC remained in place, however, until the BBC&#x27;s network-wide branding refresh on 4 October 1997, when the official billing name and on-air branding changed to CBBC (Children&#x27;s ITV changed their official billing name to CITV after their own branding refresh the following year).

From 1996 to 1999, CBBC programmes were also shown on the channel Nickelodeon, as part of the &quot;CBBC on Nickelodeon&quot; (known as Children&#x27;s BBC on Nickelodeon from 1996 to 1997) programming block. The CBBC on Nickelodeon block was originally hosted by Otis the Aardvark from its launch until 4 October 1997, when he was replaced by Marvin P. Porcevark, who unlike Otis, never appeared on the original CBBC block.

The launch of digital channel BBC Choice in 1998 saw the channel broadcasting children&#x27;s programming in a Saturday afternoon slot which was subsequently replaced by the daily 6 am to 7 pm service CBBC on Choice, which aired archive preschool programming and was itself the precursor of the current CBBC and CBeebies channels.

=== 2002–2012 ===
In 2002, the launch of the CBBC and CBeebies channels saw a wide variety of programmes, both new and archive, being shown again on the new channels from 6 am or 7 am until 7 pm.

In 2005, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, was questioned in the House of Commons as to whether a public service broadcaster should really be broadcasting &quot;lavatorial&quot; humour. Ms Jowell responded that it was the government&#x27;s job to develop a charter for the BBC; and then the BBC&#x27;s job to determine standards of taste, decency, and appropriateness.

BBC Children&#x27;s relocated to BBC Bridge House, MediaCityUK in Salford Quays in May 2011. In September 2011, the flagship magazine show &quot;Blue Peter&quot; began live broadcasts from its new home, with daily news programme &quot;Newsround&quot; joining it in November 2011.

=== 2012–present ===
Following the decline in viewing on BBC One and BBC Two and as part of the Delivering Quality First proposals submitted by the BBC in October 2011 and approved by the BBC Trust in May 2012, it was announced all children&#x27;s programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two. Children&#x27;s programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012 with the CBeebies&#x27; morning strand on BBC Two ending on 4 January 2013.

In November 2015, as a further aspect of the Delivering Quality First plan that resulted in the replacement of BBC Three with a branded digital presence, the BBC Trust approved a proposal for CBBC to extend its broadcast day by two hours, using bandwidth previously reserved for BBC Three. The two new hours are aimed towards an older youth audience.

On 14 March 2016, CBBC unveiled a new logo and on-air presentation, featuring an abstract, multicoloured wordmark enclosed in a box. CBBC controller Cheryl Taylor stated that the new brand was designed to be &quot;fun and unpredictable&quot; and would &quot;appeal to both ends of our broad age spectrum&quot;. The logo was also meant to be suitable for use across digital platforms. On 11 April 2016, CBBC officially extended its broadcast day to be from 7:00 am to 9:00 pm.

Throughout the decade, changes in viewing patterns had an impact on BBC Children&#x27;s services. Ofcom research showed that between 2010 and 2017, television viewing dropped by 40% for children aged 4–9 and by 47% for children aged 10–15.

On 4 July 2017, the BBC announced as part of its inaugural Annual Plan for 2017–18, that it would invest an additional £34 million into children&#x27;s content for digital platforms over the next three years, in an effort to counter changes in viewing habits.

In 2019, it was announced that the Children&#x27;s and Education departments would merge to become BBC Children&#x27;s and Education.

In March 2021, the BBC announced that the CBBC channel&#x27;s broadcast hours would be reduced, closing at 7 pm instead of 9 pm each day from January 2022. This is a return to the channel&#x27;s broadcast hours before their extension in 2016. The move is to make way for the return of BBC Three to linear broadcast television.

In May 2022, it is announced the CBBC will move to online-only service alongside BBC Four since BBC Three moved to online-only service in 2016 and the change will take place either in 2025 or 2026.

== Management ==
BBC Children&#x27;s and Education is part of BBC North. Management of the division, in-house production and broadcast and production of presentation links for CBBC and CBeebies is based there.

Overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC&#x27;s services for children rests with the Director of Children&#x27;s, Patricia Hidalgo Reina (since May 2020), with commissioning decisions made by a Head of Commissioning and Acquisitions for the 0–6 age group and 7–12 age group, respectively. The 7–12 age group is commissioned by Sarah Muller since Feb 2021, with the 0–6 age group post waiting to be filled.

== Programming ==
BBC Children&#x27;s commissions and acquires a wide range of programme types, including drama, preschool, news, entertainment, and factual programming. CBBC and CBeebies is therefore often seen as offering a similar mix of formats to the wider BBC, albeit tailored to suit a young audience. &quot;Byker Grove&quot; was one of the very few shows that was not aimed at young children, rather a more teenage/young adult audience as it dealt with some controversial themes.

The longest-running programme is the magazine show &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. Other current programmes include &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, &quot;Clangers&quot;, &quot;Hey Duggee&quot;, &quot;In the Night Garden&quot;, &quot;The Story of Tracy Beaker&quot;, &quot;4 O&#x27;Clock Club&quot;, &quot;Almost Never&quot;, &quot;The Dumping Ground&quot;, &quot;Got What It Takes?&quot;, &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;, &quot;Junior Bake Off&quot;, &quot;Sidekick&quot;, &quot;Odd Squad&quot;, &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot;, &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, and more.

== Scheduling on BBC One and BBC Two ==

Following the launch of Children&#x27;s BBC as a branded block in 1985, the introduction of BBC1&#x27;s daytime schedule in October 1986 led to the daily weekday offering of BBC Children&#x27;s consisting of

* A 30-minute block on BBC1 at 10:25 am usually including the &#x27;main&#x27; preschool show &quot;(Play School&quot;, then from 1988 &quot;Playbus&quot;/&quot;Playdays&quot;), children&#x27;s birthday cards, and a cartoon.
* A 15-minute preschool programme or programmes on BBC2 at 13:20 (often the slot for Me and You). This had previously been shown on BBC1.
* The main afternoon block aimed at older children from 15:50 (16:10 in July and August) to 17:35.

Weekend programmes consisted chiefly of Saturday morning programmes on BBC1, such as &quot;Going Live!&quot;. 1986 saw the introduction of children&#x27;s programmes on Sunday mornings. They were shown on BBC2 between October and January when the Open University was not being shown, and in the following year, this was expanded into an all-morning block, initially called &quot;Now on Two&quot;, later rebranded to &quot;But First This on 2.&quot; Children&#x27;s programmes had traditionally been broadcast on weekdays during the school holidays and the launch of daytime television saw this expanded during the summer holidays into a three-hour block, broadcast from 9:05 am until 12:00 pm on BBC1 and branded &quot;But First This&quot;. By 1992, children&#x27;s programmes broadcast all morning on BBC2 leading up to the older pop show &quot;The O Zone&quot;.

Periodically, &quot;Children&#x27;s BBC Scotland&quot; was aired in the Scottish school holidays on BBC One Scotland and BBC Two Scotland throughout the 1990s, where the block (like CBeebies Alba and CBBC Alba) featured its own presentation and presenters (as an opt out from the network) linking into various shows airing on BBC Scotland&#x27;s regional versions of the summer holiday mid-morning slot, the Children&#x27;s BBC Breakfast Show and the summer holiday children&#x27;s programme Up For It, until the CBBC Scotland opt outs were discontinued by July 2000.

In 1995, children&#x27;s programmes started to be shown on BBC2 at weekday breakfast. The block was called &quot;Children&#x27;s BBC Breakfast Show&quot;. By 2000, the CBBC Breakfast Show would air from 07:00 to 09:00, extended in the school holidays with CBBC mostly on BBC One in the Christmas holidays, followed by the birthday card slot from 10:00 to 10:50, often linked by one of the Breakfast Show presenters; a single or more preschooler shows would air around 1:00 pm, also on BBC Two, linked by one of the presenters and Emlyn the Gremlyn then the afternoon block on BBC One would begin at 3:25 pm with a mixture of younger kids shows and older kids&#x27; shows, linked by two presenters and Emlyn the Gremlyn. Weekend programmes consisted chiefly of Saturday morning programmes on BBC One with CBBC from 07:00 to 09:00, Linked by the presenters, with &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; taking over from 09:00 until 12:10. Sunday mornings consisted of the CBBC Birthday Cards on BBC One from spring until the autumn with CBBC on BBC Two starting from 08:15 in the spring and summer and at 07:00 in the autumn and winter with the slot finishing at 11:15. In the summer, the CBBC slot would begin on BBC Two at 07:00 in its breakfast show slot before switching to BBC One at 09:00, finishing at 11:15.

=== Relaunch to CBeebies and CBBC ===
Further changes to the schedule were rolled out during the 1990s and 2000s, including the introduction in the late 1980s of Sunday morning programmes on BBC2, initially only during the Open University&#x27;s winter break and then subsequently year-round; the introduction of a regular weekday morning &quot;breakfast show&quot; format, also on BBC2; the relocation of the daytime preschool slot to BBC2, later returning to BBC1 at the start of the afternoon block.

The lunchtime block also continued to air on BBC2. From 1990 to 1993, like the previous block &quot;See-Saw&quot;, this was introduced by the continuity announcer. In 1993, Children&#x27;s BBC launched a &quot;Lunchtime Club&quot; for this slot and introduced by the then rota of Children&#x27;s BBC presenters. In 1996, it was handed back to the continuity announcer&#x27;s duty again to introduce the programmes. From 1998 to 1999, just an ident was played out with no announcements.

On 3 September 2001, children&#x27;s programming on CBBC got separated in the lead up to the launch of two children&#x27;s channels which would be separated for different age groups, the CBBC Breakfast Show would air older children&#x27;s shows from 07:00 to 08:10, followed by a block of younger kids&#x27; programmes from 08:10 to 10:50, often linked by one of the Breakfast Show presenters; a single preschooler show would air around 1:00 pm, also on BBC Two, then the afternoon block on BBC One would begin at 3:25 pm with 25 minutes of shows for the under-sevens, presented mostly in voiceover, followed from 3:50 pm by the older kids&#x27; shows, linked in-vision.

When the CBeebies and CBBC digital channels began, children&#x27;s programming on BBC One and BBC Two remained in the same slots but adopted the new branding. Viewing figures were considerably higher on BBC One and Two as not every viewer could receive the digital channels either because the service was not available in their area or because they had old equipment not able to receive it.

From February 2002, the morning block consisted of 60 minutes of CBeebies-branded content from 06:00, followed by ninety minutes of CBBC from 07:00, then further CBeebies content from 08:30; in the afternoon on BBC One, there was a block of CBeebies content from 3:15 pm followed by CBBC content for the remainder of the afternoon slot. Following the removal of BBC Schools&#x27; content from daytime BBC Two (into the BBC Learning Zone), the time allocated to CBeebies on BBC Two was extended.

=== 2008–09: Shift to earlier BBC Slot in weekday afternoons ===
On 11 February 2008, following the move of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; from BBC Two to BBC One, CBBC on BBC One was shifted to run from 3:05 to 5:15 pm rather than from 3:25 to 5:35 pm as before, in order to accommodate the 45 minute show before the Six O Clock News. The changes were made following the BBC&#x27;s loss of the rights to soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, which had for many years been broadcast between the end of CBBC and the start of the 6 pm news; when the decision was made to move daytime editions of both &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; and &quot;Pointless&quot; which debuted in 2009 from BBC Two to One to fill the gap, CBBC had to move to an earlier slot as &quot;Weakest Link&quot; and &quot;Pointless&quot; were longer than &quot;Neighbours&quot; was.

In 2009, a report published by the BBC Trust found that scheduling changes which took place in February 2008, where programming ended at 17:15, had led to a decrease in viewers. This was especially noticeable for &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and &quot;Newsround&quot;, two of CBBC&#x27;s flagship programmes; &quot;Blue Peter was&quot; recording its lowest viewing numbers since it started in 1958, and &quot;Newsround&quot; received fewer than 100,000 viewers compared to 225,000 in 2007.

=== 2012–13: End of children&#x27;s programmes on BBC One and BBC Two ===
Following the decline in viewing on BBC One and BBC Two and as part of the Delivering Quality First proposals submitted by the BBC in October 2011 and approved by the BBC Trust in May 2012, it was announced all children&#x27;s programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two. Children&#x27;s programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012 with the CBeebies&#x27; morning strand on BBC Two ending on 4 January 2013.

=== 2017–present: Return to BBC Two ===
CBBC programming returned to BBC Two on Saturday mornings in September 2017 when &quot;Saturday Mash-Up!&quot; launched, however this strand continues to use the regular BBC continuity announcers and not the CBBC presenters.

On 11 January 2021, programming for children returned to BBC Two to provide educational content for children during school closures as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. In September 2022, CBeebies programming (including &quot;Newsround&quot;) are back on BBC Two when its Saturday morning strand rebranded as the &quot;Kids Zone&quot;.

== Other services ==
=== CBBC Extra ===
CBBC Extra, launched in 2005, was a free interactive television service from CBBC provided by BBC Red Button which was available on all digital platforms in the United Kingdom. It was accessible from the CBBC channel by pressing red and then selecting CBBC Extra. It could also be accessed from any other BBC channel by pressing red and going to page number 570. The service differed across digital platforms, for example digital satellite (i.e. Sky) viewers could access a video loop, however its availability on digital terrestrial (Freeview) was dependent upon BBC Red Button not showing other interactive services, such as major sports events coverage. Prior to CBBC&#x27;s rebranding in 2016, CBBC Extra was shut down.

=== CBBC website ===
The CBBC website provides a wide range of activities for children aged 6–15, such as games, videos, puzzles, print and makes, including now defunct pre-moderated message boards, now replaced with comment threads below videos, games and articles. It also contains a TV guide and an area where kids can apply to be on a show. It provides content for all brands including &quot;Tracy Beaker&quot;, &quot;Sam &amp; Mark&#x27;s Big Friday Wind-Up&quot;, &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;, &quot;Stacey Dooley&#x27;s Show Me What You&#x27;re Made Of&quot;, &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot;, &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, &quot;Newsround&quot;, &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, &quot;The Dumping Ground&quot;, &quot;Wolfblood&quot;, &quot;Eve&quot;, &quot;Dick and Dom&quot;, &quot;Hetty Feather&quot;, &quot;Hank Zipzer&quot;, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, and &quot;DIXI&quot;. It also gives kids the chance to view the BBC iPlayer to replay or catch up their favourite CBBC programmes for up to 1 year.

=== Gaelic and Welsh services ===
BBC-produced children&#x27;s programming, in native languages of Scotland and Wales, also airs on BBC Alba and S4C, respectively.

=== High definition channels ===
CBBC programmes were also broadcast in high definition alongside other BBC content on BBC HD, generally at afternoons on weekends, unless the channel was covering other events. When BBC HD was closed on 26 March 2013, CBBC HD launched on 10 December 2013.

<doc id="565335" wikidata="Q1848881" url="?curid=565335" title="List of Billboard number-one singles of 1958">
<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing songs in the United States. The chart was first issued in the magazine issue of August 4, 1958. Prior to that, &quot;Billboard&quot; published four popular song charts; the &quot;Top 100&quot;, the first &quot;Billboard&quot; chart to feature a combined tabulation of sales, airplay and jukebox play; &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot;, ranking the best-selling singles in retail stores; &quot;Most Played by Jockeys&quot;, ranking the most played songs on US radio stations; and the leading song chart, &quot;Honor Roll of Hits&quot;, which ranked the most popular songs (not singles) in the country. With the foundation of the Hot 100, &quot;Top 100&quot; and &quot;Most Played by Jockeys&quot; were discontinued. &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot; continued until October 13, 1958, while &quot;Honor Roll of Hits&quot; continued until 1963.
In 1958, twenty-five different songs were able to top one of the four charts. A majority of the songs which topped the &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot;, which &quot;Billboard&quot; considered the predecessor of the Hot 100, were able to also top the two other singles-tracking charts. The first song to top all three charts was Danny &amp; the Juniors&#x27; &quot;At the Hop&quot;.

On the Hot 100, eight acts hit the top, which were also their first. Those acts include Ricky Nelson, Domenico Modugno, The Elegants, Tommy Edwards, Conway Twitty, The Kingston Trio, The Teddy Bears, and The Chipmunks (even though David Seville went to number one earlier this year with “Witch Doctor“, which hit prior to the creation of the Hot 100).

==Pre-Hot 100==
NOTE: The Hot 100 Era officially began on Monday, August 4, 1958, which would be the week ending August 10 (issue date August 4). The Best Sellers in Stores list issued through October 13.

<text>The Jack Kirby Comics Industry Awards were a set of awards for achievement in comic books, presented from 1985 to 1987. Voted on by comic-book professionals, the Kirby awards were the first such awards since the Shazam Awards ceased in 1975. Sponsored by &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; magazine (which was published by Fantagraphics), and managed by &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; managing editor Dave Olbrich, the Kirby Awards were named after the pioneering writer and artist Jack Kirby.

== History ==
The Kirby Awards came about in reaction against the 1983 institution of the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Awards, which were voted on by fans; Olbrich (and the editors at Fantagraphics) wished to create an award voted on by comics professionals (meaning creators, retailers, and distribution personnel). Nominations for the Kirby Awards were made by &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; editors and warehouse employees, with the final ballots printed in issues of &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;. The awards themselves were distributed at the annual San Diego Comic-Con, with Jack Kirby himself on hand to congratulate the winners. In 1985, 238 ballots were cast, about 100 of them by comics creators.

In 1987, a dispute arose when Olbrich and Fantagraphics, publisher of &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, each claimed ownership of the awards, and Kirby removed himself from the equation. A compromise was reached, and starting in 1988, the Kirby Award was discontinued. Two new awards were created: the Eisner Award, managed by Olbrich and named after Will Eisner; and the Fantagraphics-managed Harvey Award, named for Harvey Kurtzman. Both of the new awards allowed voting only by comics industry professionals.

<doc id="565339" wikidata="Q2524352" url="?curid=565339" title="Butsu Zone">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiroyuki Takei. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from March to August 1997, with its chapters collected in three &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. &quot;Buddha Zone&quot; is the concept by which a Buddha can appear on Earth using a Buddha statue.

The series highlights the adventures of Senju (the Thousand-Hand Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva) who has to find and protect Sachi, an incarnation of the Buddha Miroku (Maitreya Bodhisattva). Miroku is said to appear on Earth at a time when the Dharma is no longer taught and is completely forgotten, achieve complete enlightenment and then re-teach the pure dharma, becoming a successor of Śākyamuni Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. It is thus Senju&#x27;s job to aid Miroku (Sachi) in achieving enlightenment, enabling her to achieve Buddha.

==Description==
In 1975, a young orphan girl named Sachi protests against the planned destruction of the temple Saigan (her home) by the Minoura clan, who plans to build a hotel in its place. When one of the gangsters notices the statue of the Thousand-Hand Kannon within the temple, Sachi tells them that she will not allow anything to happen to the statue. In response, the gangsters laugh and threaten her, telling her that there is nothing the statue can do to save her. However, the Thousand-Hand Kannon comes to life, breaking the temple doors and attacking one of the gangsters. The statue shatters into pieces and inside it is a boy who tells them to lay their hands off Sachi, sending fear amongst the gangsters who then flee, vowing revenge. The boy introduces himself as Senju, the Thousand-Hand Kannon.

Senju, as an emissary of the buddha Kannon, has appeared in the human world to find and protect the reincarnation of the future Buddha, Miroku. Recognizing Sachi as Miroku, Senju reveals that it is his mission to accompany her to India where she will awaken and achieve enlightenment to save the world from destruction. However, they are inhibited by the Mara, forces that seek to pollute with earthly desires, and Buddha who believe that Senju is not strong enough to protect Sachi from harm.

==Characters==
:Senju, known as the Thousand-Hand Avalokiteśvara, is a Bodhisattva sent to protect the incarnation of the bodhisattva Miroku by Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana). He wears garments called a and has an arm ring on his left arm. Because his original statue was made of wood, Senju can float.
:A young girl who was abandoned by her parents 10 years before the beginning of the story and raised by a poor priest. Sachi is an incarnation of the Buddha Miroku. She is initially suspicious towards Senju, but eventually follows him to avoid being attacked constantly by the envoys of Mara.
:(The Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha) Senju&#x27;s childhood friend. He had waited for 2500 years for Miroku&#x27;s appearance. His primary attack is the ; he also has the which he used only once in the series.
:The leader of the Minoura clan, Minoura destroyed Sachi&#x27;s temple, but was defeated by Senju. He and his clan later become Buddhist monks and help rebuild the temple. The origin of the character name is American comic book artist and writer Mike Mignola.
:The main antagonist. A former Bodhisattva who went towards Mara. He is the leader of the forces opposing the awakening of Miroku. He was once friends with Senju.
:A stone lion/dog looking statue who originally posed next to a temple, he was rescued by Senju when he was thrown. He followed Senju onto Earth.
:The Bodhisattva Hayagriva, he was sent to replace Senju when the situation becomes critical.

Found on Mount Osore, she was raised by an elderly &quot;itako&quot;, whom Anna views as a grandmother. She has a cheerful and indomitable spirit, along with an unscrupulous desire to obtain money in order to travel the world and find her birth parents. Her character later inspired Anna Kyoyama, one of the main characters of Takei&#x27;s later work, &quot;Shaman King&quot;.
:A wood carver and sculptor who created Senju&#x27;s body. He modeled Senju&#x27;s appearance based on that of his deceased sister, Osen. Senju and the other communicate with him using Anna as a medium.

<text>Nação Zumbi (formerly Chico Science &amp; Nação Zumbi) is a Brazilian band formed by Chico Science. They have been hailed as one of the most important groups to come out of the manguebeat movement in the 1990s. The musicians of the group continued as Nação Zumbi after Science died in a car accident on February 2, 1997.

In their songs they experiment with mixing of rock, punk, funk, hip hop, soul, Pernambuco&#x27;s regional rhythms and Brazilian traditional music, with heavy use of percussion instruments.

They released two albums before the time of Chico&#x27;s death, &quot;Da lama ao caos&quot; (&quot;From Mud to Chaos&quot;) in 1994 and &quot;Afrociberdelia&quot; in 1996. Both received critical acclaim.

In 1996, Nação Zumbi contributed &quot;Maracatu Atômico&quot; to the AIDS-Benefit Album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization.

<text>The Cymru Alliance League (known for sponsorship reasons as Huws Gray Alliance) was a football league in north and central Wales which formed the second level of the Welsh football league system. From the 2019/20 season onwards, it was replaced by the Cymru North. 

If the team which finished top of the league held a Domestic Licence, it could apply for promotion to the Welsh Premier League and was replaced by one of the bottom two teams in the Welsh Premier League.

If the league champions did not hold a Domestic Licence, then the team which finished second, if in possession of a Domestic Licence, could be promoted instead. The most successful club in the league was Caernarfon Town with three titles.

The Cymru Alliance also operated the Cymru Alliance League Cup, a knock out competition contested by members of the league

The teams also participated in Welsh Cup, the main Cup competition in Wales.

<text>Project Phoenix was a SETI project to search for extraterrestrial intelligence by analyzing patterns in radio signals. It was run by the independently funded SETI Institute of Mountain View, California, U.S.

Project Phoenix started work in February 1995 with the Parkes radio telescope located in New South Wales, Australia, the largest telescope in the Southern Hemisphere.

Between September 1996 and April 1998, the Project used the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank in Green Bank, West Virginia, U.S.

Rather than attempting to scan the whole sky for messages, the Project concentrated on nearby systems that are similar to our own. Project Phoenix&#x27;s targets comprised about 800 stars with a 200 light-year range.

The Project searched for radio signals as narrow as 1 Hz between 1,000 and 3,000 MHz: a broad bandwidth compared with most SETI searches.

In March 2004 the Project announced that after checking the 800 stars on its list, it had failed to find any evidence of extraterrestrial signals. Project leader Peter Backus remarked that they had been forced to conclude that &quot;we live in a quiet neighborhood&quot;.

<text>Recife Antigo (Old Recife) is the historical section of central Recife, Brazil. It is located on the Island of Recife, near the Recife harbor. This historic area has been recently recovered and now holds several clubs, bars and a high-tech center called &quot;Porto Digital&quot;.

==History==
Recife Antigo consists of the initial Portuguese settlement in the 16th century around the port. Sugar cane production from Pernambuco was delivered to Portugal through Recife&#x27;s port. While Recife had port functions, Olinda was the capital. In 1630, the Dutch invaded Pernambuco, set Olinda partially on fire and Recife became the seat of the Dutch government. Count John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen became Governor-General of the Dutch colony and built a new town on a neighboring island. This city was named Mauritsstadt and the Palácio do Campo das Princesas, seat of the State of Pernambuco government, is built on its ruins.

The Dutch were forced out in 1654 of a Recife with good infrastructure, for they had built canals and improved the port and the defenses of it. A flourishing Jewish community lived in Recife under them and they had to leave it because of the Portuguese Inquisition. Thus, a group of 24 Portuguese Jews who had previously migrated from Portugal to the Netherlands because of antisemitism, headed farther North with the Dutch, where New Amsterdam—present-day Manhattan—was founded. The first Synagogue built in the Americas, the Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue, is located in Recife Antigo, on Rua do Bom Jesus, formerly Rua dos Judeus, or Street of the Jews. The Portuguese synagogue was founded in lower Manhattan and it is located on Central Park West in Manhattan nowadays under the name Portuguese &amp; Spanish synagogue.

Particular targets of their humour are Ralph T. Guard; the Warner studio&#x27;s security guard, and Otto Scratchansniff, the lot&#x27;s psychiatrist.

The Warners are siblings, with Yakko (voiced by Rob Paulsen) as the oldest of the three. He is gregarious, charismatic, and generally seen as the leader of the group. Wakko (voiced by Jess Harnell) is the middle child, with a Scouse accent modelled on Ringo Starr. Wakko is a glutton, and frequently pulls items out of his &quot;gag bag&quot; to provide most of the series&#x27; slapstick humour in the same manner as Harpo Marx. Dot (full name Princess Angelina Contessa Louisa Francesca Banana Fanna Bo Besca III; voiced by Tress MacNeille) is the youngest and only female of the three. Dot is cute, bubbly and generally friendly, though can also be vain, rude and bossy.

==Role within the series==
The Warners were created by the animation department of the Warner Brothers studio in 1930. However, their antics caused chaos all over the lot and the films in which they starred proved to be completely nonsensical. The films were put into the studio vault and never released, while the Warners themselves were locked in the studio water tower. Warner Brothers disavowed any knowledge of the trio&#x27;s existence until the series&#x27; present time, when they escape and resume their old mischievous habits.

==Concept and creation==

Series creator Tom Ruegger initially modeled the Warners&#x27; personalities heavily on those of his three sons. The species of the Warners has been made deliberately unclear within the series. Officially, within the series, the Warners are claimed to be &quot;Cartoonus characterus&quot;, a fake Latin phrase. The characters were also originally intended to be ducks. The Warners&#x27; parents are not known, but in the movie &quot;Wakko&#x27;s Wish&quot;, it is revealed that they were the king and queen of Warnerstock.

<text>Daniel Haines (January 6, 1801 – January 26, 1877) was an American attorney, jurist, and politician who served as the 14th Governor of New Jersey in nonconsecutive terms in office from 1843 to 1845 and 1848 to 1851. During his first term, Haines was instrumental in calls for constitutional reform which led to the New Jersey Constitution of 1844. In both terms, he promoted educational reform and prison reform, a cause he continued to champion in retirement.

== Early life ==
Daniel Haines was born on January 6, 1801, in New York City to Elias and Mary (née Ogden) Haines. He was the eldest of seven children.

Elias Haines was a well-known and successful merchant in New York City, and his father Stephen Haines had been a distinguished patriot in the American Revolution. Their earliest ancestors had settled at Salem, Massachusetts in 1637 before moving to Southold, New York. The Haineses were among the first settlers of Elizabethtown, New Jersey. Mary Ogden was the daughter of Robert Ogden III and the niece of Aaron Ogden, who would serve as Governor of New Jersey in 1812 and 1813.

Daniel Haines was educated privately in New York before attending a preparatory school in Elizabethtown. He graduated from The College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1820. After graduation, Haines entered the law office of his uncle, Thomas C. Ryerson, in Newton. He was admitted to the bar in 1823 and began his own practice in Hamburg.

== Early political career ==
Haines began his political life as a member of the Federalist Party, but supported Andrew Jackson in the 1824 presidential election, as did most of his neighbors in Sussex County. As a leading resident of small Vernon Township, Haines secured every single vote in the township for Jackson.

Haines continued his private legal practice for fifteen more years before entering public office in 1838, when he was elected to represent Sussex County in the New Jersey Legislative Council by a large majority. Upon his inauguration, he immediately became involved in the Broad Seal War, a bitter partisan controversy over the 1838 elections to the United States Congress. When the House of Representatives seated the Democratic ticket over the Whig claimants, Whig legislators from Morris and Essex counties introduced resolutions denouncing the action; Haines led the Democratic caucus in the ensuing debate. Though the resolutions passed, Haines&#x27;s leadership role elevated his status within his party and the state.

== Governor of New Jersey ==
===1843 election===
In 1843, the Democratic Party won control of the Legislative Council. At the time, the Governor of New Jersey was the presiding officer of the council and elected by its members; the Governor jointly served as Chancellor. On October 27, 1843, Haines was nominated as the Democratic candidate in a meeting of the legislative caucus, ensuring his election.

===First term (184345)===
During his first term as Governor, Haines led efforts for constitutional reform consistent with a belated transition to Jacksonian democracy. In his own words, Haines argued that the state constitution had &quot;provisions which are at least inexpedient if not wholly incompatible with the spirit of the present age.&quot; Two of his chief concerns were dividing the offices of Governor and Chancellor and the election of the Governor by popular vote, rather than legislative majority. To smooth partisan concerns over reform, Haines called for a bipartisan convention on the argument that the constitution was &quot;a measure which is too momentous to be made the subject of party difference.&quot; The new Constitution was ratified in 1844.

In addition to constitutional reform, Haines placed emphasis on educational and military policy. He called on the legislature to revise the common school law, under which local authorities avoided their delegated responsibility to visit and examine their schools and report to the state. Haines suggested that the Council and State Assembly &quot;inquire into the expediency of appointing a general superintendent,&quot; and the office was introduced in 1844.

In his second annual message, Haines turned his focus to the state militia, which he announced &quot;seems to have fallen in great disrepute&quot; after insufficient record-keeping led to an annual loss of federal military supplies. Haines additionally complained that troops were poorly disciplined, and that &quot;the ordinary militia musters... are generally admitted to retard rather than to promoted improvement; and to be a tax upon the time and service of the citizen without any corresponding benefit.&quot;

Haines peremptorily declined to be nominated for Governor in the 1844 election, the first under the new Constitution he had championed. It was won narrowly by Charles C. Stratton, a Whig; Haines left office on January 21, 1845.

===1847 election===
On September 22, 1847, the Democratic state convention nominated Haines for governor on the first ballot.

In the November election, he defeated William Wright, a former mayor of Newark and U.S. Representative, despite the fact that the Whigs won the legislative elections. He was sworn into office for a three-year term.

===Second term (18481851)===
In his second term, Haines continued his crusade for educational reform. He called on the legislature to make education its main priority, as &quot;not many more than one half of the children in the state receive instruction in the schools [and]... a very large proportion must be growing up in ignorance.&quot; To improve the quality of public education, Haines called for a state normal school to educate teachers, the introduction of free public education, and an increase in revenues apportioned to state and local schools.

Haines also took an interest in prison reform during his second term in office. He claimed that the prisons were &quot;schools for vice, whose youngest pupils may become the ripest scholars and most finished rogues.&quot; He decried the common housing of &quot;the hardened villain and the juvenile delinquent&quot; in the same cells and called for the establishment of workshops in county prisons, separation of older and younger prisoners, and the construction of a reform school for juveniles.

== New Jersey Supreme Court ==
After his second term ended in 1851, Haines returned to the private practice of law in Hamburg for one year, taking on prominent cases of national importance. In one case involving Charles Goodyear&#x27;s right to vulcanize Indian rubber, his co-counsel was Daniel Webster.

In 1852, Governor George Franklin Fort appointed Haines to a seven-year term on the New Jersey Supreme Court. He was sworn in after Senate confirmation in November. He was reappointed in 1859 by William A. Newell and retired from the bench in 1866.

As a jurist responsible for the Newark circuit, Haines won the praise of fellow justice Lucius Elmer, who said &quot;few judges were ever freer from the influence of passion or prejudice.&quot;

==Later political activities==
During and after his judicial service, Haines remained an active member of the Democratic Party.

In 1860, Haines supported Stephen A. Douglas for president over Abraham Lincoln, whose election he feared &quot;might precipitate war.&quot; He continued to oppose calls for war until the Battle of Fort Sumter, when he became an active supporter of the Union cause and assisted in efforts to raise troops. He supported George B. McClellan against Lincoln in 1864, feeling that &quot;the measures of the administration tend to protract the war.&quot; After leaving the bench, Haines supported Horatio Seymour in 1868 because he was &quot;steadily opposed to most of the measures of reconstruction adopted by the Republican Party.&quot;

After leaving the bench, Haines remained an activist for prison reform until his death. In 1868, the legislature appointed Haines to lead a study on prison systems in New Jersey and other states. In 1870, Governor Theodore F. Randolph appointed him a delegate to the National Congress on Penitentiary and Reformatory Discipline, which in turn named him to a committee to organize a national reform association and serve as a delegate to the International Convention of Prison Discipline and Reform in London in 1872. In 1872, he also served as vice president of the National Prison Association.

== Personal life and death==
Haines married his first wife, Ann Maria Austin of Warwick, New York on June 28, 1827. They had three daughters and two sons. Their son, Thomas Ryerson Haines, died at the Battle of Harrisonburg during the Civil War. Anna Maria died on December 8, 1844.

Haines remarried to Mary Townsend of Newark on July 6, 1865.

Haines was a ruling elder of the Presbyterian Church, President of the Sussex County Bible Society, and a member of the committee to reunify the Church after the Civil War.

Haines died at his home in Hamburg, New Jersey on January 26, 1877, and was buried at North Hardyston Cemetery in Hardyston Township, New Jersey.

<text>Gary Stephen &quot;Angry&quot; Anderson (born 5 August 1947) is an Australian rock singer, songwriter, television personality and actor. He has been the lead vocalist and the longest-tenured remaining member of the hard rock band Rose Tattoo since 1976. As a solo artist, he is best known for his international hit &quot;Suddenly&quot; (1987).

On Australia Day 26 January 1993, Anderson was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his role as a youth advocate. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, &quot;over the course of a lengthy career, [the] gravel-throated vocalist ... has gone from attention-grabbing, rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll bad boy to all-round Australian media star.&quot; Rose Tattoo were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006.

== Biography ==

Gary Stephen Anderson was born on 5 August 1947 in Melbourne, Victoria, to an Anglo-Australian father and Mauritian mother. He has a brother Rodney living in Melbourne. Anderson&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Angry Ant&quot; developed &quot;during his youth after his aggressive and volatile nature got the better of him.&quot; According to Anderson, his father &quot;was a deeply troubled man... I&#x27;ve dealt with my rage, my pain... I was a very angry boy... When he was around he was a very explosive person.&quot; Anderson used his uncle, Ivan, as his role model: a cigarette-smoking, beer-drinking, leather jacket-wearing, motorcycle-riding drummer in a swing band. Anderson grew up in suburban Coburg and attended Coburg Technical School before working as a fitter and turner in a factory. Initially he wanted to be a blues guitarist, &quot;I wanted to be like all the great blues guitar players, then I wanted to be like Bob Dylan, then of course... John Lennon.&quot; Anderson found himself in a band with three possible guitarists and &quot;[t]he other two were much better than me, so the only other thing we needed was a singer... [we] had to sing &#x27;Twist and Shout&#x27; without accompaniment. I just happened to be the best one at it.&quot;

From 1971 to 1973, Anderson led rock group Peace Power and Purity and came to wider public notice as the lead vocalist with Buster Brown. He fronted the hard rock and blues rock band from its foundation in 1973, the original line-up included Phil Rudd on drums, who left in 1974 to join AC/DC. In 1975, Buster Brown released an album, &quot;Something to Say&quot;, on Mushroom Records/Festival Records before disbanding in November that year.

In 1976 in Sydney, Rose Tattoo was formed by Peter Wells of the heavy metal band Buffalo. Anderson had relocated to Sydney and replaced the group&#x27;s original singer Tony Lake. When their drummer Michael Vandersluys departed soon afterwards, he was replaced by Dallas Royall, who had been Rudd&#x27;s replacement in Buster Brown. Their most popular single on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart was &quot;Bad Boy for Love&quot; from 1977, which peaked at No. 19. Rose Tattoo&#x27;s 1981 tour of Europe included an appearance at the Reading Festival, where Anderson repeatedly head butted the amp stacks until his scalp started bleeding.

Anderson&#x27;s debut as an actor was a minor role in &quot;Bullamakanka&quot; (1983). Later, he appeared as the character Ironbar Bassey in the film &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; (1985). &quot;Filmink&quot; magazine later wrote that Anderson &quot;appeared in surprisingly few acting roles for someone with such renown as a presenter.&quot;

Anderson joined as a guest vocalist with The Incredible Penguins, for a cover of &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot;, a charity project for research on little penguins, which peaked at No. 10 in December 1985. In 1987, he played Lenin in the musical &quot;Rasputin&quot;, composed by David Tyyd, at the State Theatre in Sydney.

Anderson led Rose Tattoo through five studio albums until disbanding the group in 1987, by which time he was the only member remaining from the early line-up. During 1986, as Rose Tattoo was winding down following the recording of &quot;Beats from a Single Drum&quot;, Anderson joined The Party Boys for an Australian tour, but never recorded with them. By this time Anderson had established himself as an advocate on social issues and made regular appearances on the Channel Nine programs &quot;The Midday Show with Ray Martin&quot; and then &quot;A Current Affair&quot; as a human interest reporter.

In 1987, Anderson had his biggest hit, when the uncharacteristic ballad &quot;Suddenly&quot; from the album, &quot;Beats from a Single Drum&quot;, was used as the wedding theme for the &quot;Neighbours&quot; episode in which the popular characters Scott Robinson and Charlene Mitchell married. Robinson was portrayed by Jason Donovan, while Mitchell&#x27;s character was portrayed by pop singer, Kylie Minogue, who had issued her debut single in July as a cover version of &quot;Locomotion.&quot; &quot;Locomotion&quot; was at number one on the Australian charts preventing &quot;Suddenly&quot; from reaching the top spot. &quot;Beats from a Single Drum&quot; had been planned as Anderson&#x27;s debut solo release, but had initially been billed as a Rose Tattoo album due to contractual obligations; however, after the success of &quot;Suddenly&quot;, it was re-released in 1988 as an Angry Anderson solo album. In November 1988, the single reached number three on the UK singles chart after the episode aired there.
With the dissolution of Rose Tattoo, Anderson pressed on with his solo career, releasing the album &quot;Blood from Stone&quot; in 1990 which provided the No. 11 hit single &quot;Bound for Glory.&quot; He performed the song during half-time at the 1991 AFL Grand Final between Hawthorn and , after jumping out of a vehicle resembling the Batmobile. According to The Punch&#x27;s Michael Phelan, Anderson&#x27;s performance was &quot;a teeth-gnashing, eyeballs-bleeding, nails-scratching-down-a-blackboard rendition&quot; and rates it as the worst pre-game display in Australian sporting history. Fellow guest Robert de Castella believed Anderson struggled with Waverley Park&#x27;s poor acoustics, while Anderson himself claimed that he could not hear himself over the engine noise of the &quot;Batmobile&quot;. In 1992, Anderson acted in the Australian arena-style revival of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; as Herod. On Australia Day (26 January) 1993, Anderson was made a Member of the Order of Australia with the citation, &quot;In recognition of service to the community, particularly as a youth advocate.&quot; Also that year, Rose Tattoo reunited to support Guns N&#x27; Roses on the Australian leg of their Use Your Illusion Tour, Guns N&#x27; Roses specifically requested The Tatts to support them in Australia. However, the reunion was short-lived and the band&#x27;s members returned to their solo projects.

From 1994, Anderson has used his contacts in the media to organise a Challenge where a particular charity&#x27;s project was completed with support of community and business groups. Examples of these Challenges include constructing a playground for disabled children within 48 hours, assisting drought affected farmers with reserve feed for their stock, organising Christmas presents for socially and economically disadvantaged children, building two respite units for people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS and delivering artificial limbs for Cambodian land mine victims.

Rose Tattoo reconvened in 1998 and undertook an Australian tour. The group has continued to perform despite five Rose Tattoo former band members dying of cancer: Dallas Royall (1991), Peter Wells (2006), Ian Rilen (2006), Lobby Loyde (2007) and Mick Cocks (2009). According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, &quot;over the course of a lengthy career, [the] gravel-throated vocalist ... has gone from attention-grabbing, rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll bad boy to all-round Australian media star.&quot; On 16 August 2006, Rose Tattoo were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.

In the early years of the 2000s, Anderson participated in and organised a string of charity events. In 2002, Anderson played with former members of The Angels at the &quot;Bali Relief&quot; concert in Perth, Western Australia, held in aid of victims of the Bali bombing. Anderson is involved in the Dunn Lewis Youth Development Foundation, which is a lasting legacy of two of the 88 Australian lives lost in the bombings. In 2003, Anderson appeared in a cameo role as the character Kris Quaid in the independent Australian feature film &quot;Finding Joy&quot;. At the end of the film, he sings his hit &quot;Suddenly.&quot;
Anderson appeared in a guest role in the Australian movie &quot;Suite for Fleur&quot; (2011), as Silas, Fleur&#x27;s father, a carpenter and furniture maker living in Byron Bay. In December, Anderson joined Doc Neeson ( The Angels), Mark Gable (The Choirboys), Buzz Bidstrup (The Angels), Phil Emmanuel and Matt Sorum (drummer for Guns N&#x27; Roses) on-stage to celebrate the opening of a Hard Rock Cafe in Darling Harbour. In January 2012, Anderson announced that Rose Tattoo would disband—he is a member of the National Party and is considering using his birth name, Gary, for &quot;political expediency&quot; when running as a candidate in the next federal election.

In 2014, Anderson was featured on 7mate&#x27;s successful television series &quot;Bogan Hunters&quot; as one of eight celebrity judges. Later that year, Anderson scored a role in the motion picture &quot;Fat Pizza vs. Housos&quot;. The film was shown in Australian cinemas from 27 November 2014 onwards.

== Political views ==
In July 2007, Anderson was criticised by some after espousing his views on Muslim immigration to Australia when he told the Sydney &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;:
On 1 March 2010, he told a Federal Parliamentary Committee into the impact of violence on youth that life experience has taught him &quot;Aussies use their fists&quot; when they fight and that &quot;weapons were introduced by other cultures.&quot; In March 2011, Anderson declared he was a supporter of conservative politician Tony Abbott and his views against a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. He announced in October that year that he was joining the conservative National Party, and was interested in standing for a seat in the next Australian federal election. When asked whether his more &#x27;leftie views&#x27; might be gagged (he supports same-sex marriage, for example) he replied, &quot;maintaining some sort of order and balance is about agreement, compromise, setting rules as the head of the house. I&#x27;ve learnt to be a part of the family. So I&#x27;m not going to say things in public that are going to embarrass the party.&quot; He was selected as the National candidate for the Division of Throsby in New South Wales under his birth name, Gary Anderson. Although he did not win, his preferences helped the Coalition net a four-percent swing in the seat.

In 2012, Anderson participated in the SBS doco-reality show &quot;Go Back To Where You Came From&quot;, in which six Australians, each with differing opinions on Australia&#x27;s asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At the outset of the series Anderson says that &quot;boat people&quot; who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: &quot;If you come here illegally, I don&#x27;t care about your story, first thing you do is you turn around and go back.&quot; Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: &quot;Now I&#x27;ve been here and spoken to people, I don&#x27;t want to turn away refugees, I don&#x27;t want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don&#x27;t want that. Who would want that? I don&#x27;t want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don&#x27;t want them to come to Australia in boats.&quot;

Again endorsed by the National Party in September 2014, this time in the New South Wales seat of Cessnock for the 2015 state election, Anderson withdrew his candidacy in February 2015, citing personal reasons.

In 2016 Anderson was endorsed as an Australian Liberty Alliance candidate for the Senate representing New South Wales at the 2016 federal election. The Australian Liberty Alliance is a right wing group that opposes Muslim immigration to Australia.

== Personal life ==
In Angry Anderson&#x27;s 1994 biography, &quot;Angry – Scarred for Life&quot;, the author Karen Dewey describes his life as &quot;Sexually, physically and mentally abused he broke the brutal family pattern to become a besotted, devoted father of four.&quot; Anderson described how &quot;[t]here was physical and emotional violence in the family&quot; and a family friend began sexually abusing him from the age of five.

In 1982, prior to one of Rose Tattoo&#x27;s European tours, Anderson met Lindy Michael. The couple&#x27;s daughter, Roxanne, was born in 1983. Anderson and Michael married in January 1986 and have also had three sons, Galen, Blaine and Liam. By 2002, Anderson and Michael were divorced. Anderson is a single father and lives in the Sydney suburb of Beacon Hill. Although he does not believe in an omniscient god, he attends the Baha&#x27;i temple regularly, saying: &quot;the spirituality I have given myself over to is the divine.&quot;

Having seen cancer claim the lives of five of his Rose Tattoo bandmates (Dallas Royall, Peter Wells, Ian Rilen, Lobby Lloyde and Mick Cocks), Anderson has become an advocate for men&#x27;s health. He appeared in a TV campaign promoting awareness of prostate cancer.

On 4 November 2018, Anderson&#x27;s son Liam was killed in an attack in a park in Queenscliff, New South Wales.

<text>Recipe Unlimited Corporation is a Canadian company that operates several restaurant chains such as Swiss Chalet, Harvey&#x27;s and The Keg, and food distribution for large operations. 

The company was originated in 1883 as Canada Railway News Company that sold newspapers, magazines and confectioneries before moving to the restaurant business. The present company dates to 1961, as Canada Railway News Co. merged with Aero Caterers Limited, founded in 1941 as an airline catering service, to form Cara Operations Limited and the company went public in 1968. The company adopted its present name in May 2018 and its headquarters are in Vaughan, Ontario, a suburb north of Toronto within the Greater Toronto Area.

== History ==
The company was originally chartered in 1883 as Canada Railway News Company, selling newspapers, magazines and confectionaries at railway stations. The company&#x27;s roots go back to the mid-1850s, when Thomas Patrick Phelan was selling apples and newspapers to train passengers on the Niagara Steamboats. Canada Railway News soon moved into the food business, catering to a boom in passenger rail traffic in Canada. Then, in the 1930s, the company began offering catering services to the airlines and by 1941, Aero Caterers Limited was launched. By 1951, it was serving about 1,500 meals a day.

In 1961, the company merged Canada Railway News Company and Aero Caterers and changed its name to Cara Operations Limited. The name Cara was derived from the first two letters of each of the words &quot;Canada Railway&quot;.

Cara was owned solely by the Phelan family from its inception in 1883 until it went public in 1968. At that time, its primary business was catering to the transportation sector (airline and rail meals), but it did operate restaurants and coffee shops in various office towers and airport terminals in Canada. Total sales of all the various operations was Can$30 million in 1968.

Cara’s most successful acquisition came in the form of Swiss Chalet and Harvey’s in 1977 when they attained full ownership from FoodCorp Limited. After 1977, Cara’s next acquisition was not until 1990, when they purchased Grand &amp; Toy to expand their company. The next year, Cara bought Beaver Foods and Summit Food Service Distributors, a catering company for hospitals, offices and educational institutions and a distribution company respectively. However in 1996, Cara sold Grand &amp; Toy to maintain a commitment to the food service industry and acquired a 37% share in The Second Cup Ltd. Two years later, in 1998, Cara became the largest shareholder of The Spectra Group of Great Restaurants Inc., owners of Milestones Grill and Bar. In 1999, Cara became the majority owner of three chain restaurants: Kelsey’s Neighbourhood Bar &amp; Grill, Montana’s Cookhouse and acquired the license to the Outback Steakhouse after acquiring a 61% ownership from Kelsey&#x27;s International Inc. While obtaining multiple restaurant chains, Cara sold its interest in Beaver Foods and Summit Food Service Distributors to Compass Group to maintain an organization focused on being restaurant owners in 2001. In 2002, Cara made three large transactions. First, the organization completely bought the entire Second Cup organization, then exchanged its shares of Spectra Group of Great Restaurants for control over the Milestones Bar and Grill chain, and obtained 100% ownership of Kelsey’s International Inc. The rights to Outback steakhouse were owned in Canada by Cara, but it was sold back to Outback corporation in the United States because of high food costs. In the same year, sales for the company were Can$1.9 billion. 88% of the business comes from the restaurant services, with the remaining 12% deriving from airline catering.

On February 26, 2004, Cara went private, with the Phelan heiresses buying out the minority for $8 a share or $345 million, after a short battle in which they had offered $7.625 a share for the 46.5% of the company they didn&#x27;t own. At the time, Cara fully owned Swiss Chalet, Harvey&#x27;s, Second Cup, Kelsey&#x27;s Neighborhood Bar &amp; Grill, and Montana&#x27;s. It owned as a franchisee Eastern Canadian Outback Steakhouse restaurants.

In 2010, Cara Operations exited the airline catering business with the sale of Cara Airline Solutions.

In 2013, Cara came to an agreement with Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. to make Prime Restaurants, which was previously bought by Fairfax, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cara. This transaction allowed Cara full control of East Side Mario’s, Casey’s, Bier Markt, Prime Pubs (Fionn MacCool’s and The Merchant). As a result of the deal, Fairfax became the majority stakeholders and Bill Gregson became the new president and CEO of Cara.

In 2014, it acquired the majority ownership of Landing Restaurants including Hunter’s Landing, Harper’s Landing, and Williams Landing. Cara had EBITDA of $84 million on sales of $1.7 billion in 2014, but had a 6.4 debt leverage ratio when Bill Gregson assumed the presidency of the firm, because the funds obtained via the sale of non-core-asset had been used, not to pay down debt but instead to expand the business.

In March 2015, Cara IPO at the Toronto Stock Exchange was brokered by Fairfax Financial. Shares of Cara Operations reached as high as $33 after the IPO was set at $200 million with shares to be sold at $19 to $22. As a result of returning to the Toronto Stock Exchange, Fairfax and the Phelan family had control over Cara Operations, 41% and 36% respectively, with the possession of the company&#x27;s multiple voting shares at 25 votes per share. Through the stock listing, it merged in a 7:8 ratio with Fairfax&#x27;s East Side Mario&#x27;s, Casey&#x27;s and the Bier Markt properties. The $200 million represented a 23% stake in the combined business, and the heiresses had in 2015 realised a valuation of roughly $300 million. The services of Bill Gregson were acquired in the deal by the merged company. In August 2015, Cara obtained full ownership of New York Fries to expand its already extensive line of restaurant chains in Canada. South St. Burger would not be part of the acquisition.

On March 31, 2016, Cara Operations announced that it would acquire St-Hubert Chicken $537 million. On September 1, 2016, Cara Operations acquired Franworks Group, and its Original Joe&#x27;s, State &amp; Main, and Elephant &amp; Castle brands.

In 2017, Cara acquired The Pickle Barrel.

In January 2018, Cara Operations acquired The Keg for $200 million. In May 2018, then Chief Executive Officer Bill Gregson announced that Cara Operations Limited would be changing its name to Recipe Unlimited Corporation and would be traded under the new stock symbol &quot;RECP&quot;.

On October 1, 2018, the company was hit by a malware attack, requiring closure of many of its restaurants in Canada. The attack required some restaurants to continue as cash-only operations until at least the following day. Some locations were without point-of-sale systems and also without electronic payment methods for almost a week.

In 2021, Recipe Unlimited acquired the controlling interest of Burger&#x27;s Priest.

On August 9, 2022, Fairfax Financial proposed to take the company private for $954 million. Upon completion of the deal on October 31, 2022, Recipe Unlimited&#x27;s stock was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange.

==Labour issues==
Beginning October 5, 2015, female employees at all Bier Markt locations were required to wear tight blue mini-dresses, and heels or boots as footwear on the job. The work outfit practice applied to employees at locations in Ontario and Quebec who had previously worn black pants and golf shirt as a uniform. After the CBC investigated complaints of gender discrimination, Cara modified its outfit practice to allow employees to wear the original gender-neutral uniform.

In early 2018, Cara&#x27;s CEO and President Bill Gregson announced that the recent Ontario minimum wage hike to $14 an hour had not adversely affected revenues, with sales going up throughout most of Ontario.

<doc id="565379" wikidata="Q11643111" url="?curid=565379" title="Syzygium samarangense">
<text>Syzygium samarangense is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae, native to an area that includes the Greater Sunda Islands, Malay Peninsula, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, but introduced in prehistoric times to a wider area and now widely cultivated in the tropics. Common names in English include wax apple, Java apple, Semarang rose-apple, and wax jambu.

== Description ==
&quot;Syzygium samarangense&quot; is a tropical tree growing to  tall, with evergreen leaves long and broad. The leaves are elliptical, but rounded at the base; they are aromatic when crushed. The trunk is relatively short, with a wide yet open crown starting low on the tree. The bark is pinkish-gray in color, and flakes readily.

The flowers are white to yellowish-white, diameter, with four petals and numerous stamens. They form in panicles of between three and 30 near branch tips. The resulting fruit is a bell-shaped, edible berry, with colors ranging from white, pale green, or green to red, purple, or crimson, to deep purple or even black. The fruit grows long in wild plants, and has four fleshy calyx lobes at the tip. The skin is thin, and the flesh is white and spongy. Each berry holds one or two rounded seeds not larger than . The flowers and resulting fruit are not limited to the axils of the leaves, and can appear on nearly any point on the surface of the trunk and branches. When mature, the tree is considered a heavy bearer, yielding up to 700 fruits in a crop.

When ripe, the fruit puff outwards, with a slight concavity in the middle of the underside of the &quot;bell&quot;. Healthy wax apples have a light sheen to them. Despite its name, a ripe wax apple only resembles an apple on the outside in color. It does not taste like an apple, and it has neither the fragrance nor the density of an apple. Its flavor is similar to a snow pear, and the liquid-to-flesh ratio of the wax apple is comparable to a watermelon. Unlike either apple or watermelon, the wax apple&#x27;s flesh has a very loose weave. The very middle holds a seed situated in a sort of cotton candy-like mesh. This mesh is edible, but flavorless. The color of its juice depends on the cultivar; it may be purple to entirely colorless.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
Several cultivars with larger fruit have been selected. In general, the paler or darker the color, the sweeter it is. 

In Southeast Asia, the black ones are nicknamed &quot;Black Pearl&quot; or &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, while the very pale greenish-white ones, called &quot;Pearl&quot;, are among the highest-priced ones in fruit markets. The fruit is often served uncut, but with the core removed, to preserve the unique bell-shaped presentation. 

In the Indian Ocean islands cuisine, the fruit is frequently used in salads, as well as in lightly sautéed dishes. It is mainly eaten as a fruit and also used to make pickles called &quot;chambakka achar&quot;. 

In the Philippines, its local name is &quot;macopa&quot; or &quot;makopa&quot;. Its precolonial name is &quot;dambo&quot;. Because of their similarity in appearance, it is often confused with &quot;tambis&quot; (&quot;Syzygium aqueum&quot;), although the latter is more commonly cultivated.

<text>The International Standard Version or ISV is an English translation of the Bible for which translation was complete and published electronically in 2011.

The texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls have been used to provide a textual apparatus for understanding the Old Testament.

== Characteristics==

===Translation===
The translation aims to be central between a literal translation and an idiomatic translation, a philosophy the ISV translation team call &quot;literal-idiomatic&quot; (p. xliii of the ISV Introduction). A distinctive feature of the ISV is that biblical poetry is translated into English metrical rhyme.

===Release numbers===
The Holy Bible: International Standard Version (ISV) is being produced with identifying release numbers and build sequence identifiers so as to provide tracking of improvements and additions to the text. The current release is Release 2.0. According to the ISV foundation website, a 3.0 build is not expected to be completed until 2021 at the earliest.

<doc id="565392" wikidata="Q4922271" url="?curid=565392" title="Black box voting">
<text>Black box voting is any system of voting on voting machines which does not disclose how the system operates, such as systems based on closed source software or other proprietary components. If a voting machine does not provide a tangible record of individual votes cast, it can be described as &quot;black box voting&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term, as described by Dr. Arnold Urken of Stevens Institute of Technology, comes from the jargon term &quot;black box&quot;, a device or system or object that can only be viewed in terms of its input and output characteristics, with no knowledge of its internal workings. Urken&#x27;s group at Stevens Institute was one of the first independent testing authorities for voting machines.

&quot;Black box voting&quot; was coined by David Allen, a publisher, technical consultant and co-writer to author and activist Bev Harris. Harris popularized the term in her book of the same name, and maintains the BlackBoxVoting.org website.

Allen&#x27;s formal definition is found on page 4 of the original edition of Harris&#x27;s book: &quot;Any voting system in which the mechanisms for recording and/or tabulating the vote are hidden from the voter, and/or the mechanism lacks a tangible record of the vote cast.&quot;

Both optical scan systems which interpret paper ballots and Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) systems can be black box systems; in fact, mechanical voting machines can also be seen as black box systems, since only the technicians who set up the machines have access to the linkages between the voting levers on the face of the machine and the vote recording counters inside. Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Horatio Rogers, in an 1897 dissenting opinion, wrote of one early mechanical voting machine that
: ... a voter on this voting machine has no knowledge, through his senses that he has accomplished a result. The most that can be said is, if the machine worked as intended, then he has made his holes and voted. It does not seem to me that this is enough.

Rogers&#x27; criterion for whether a voting machine is a black box is strict: you must be able to sense that it works correctly as you use it. A somewhat weaker criterion is sometimes accepted, based on whether the public is allowed to examine the mechanism, in a modern context, both the source code and hardware. Though source code may be available to voting system testing authorities and state or county election officials it can still be considered &quot;black box&quot; if it is not available to the public. Even with some open source systems, which allow examination of the source code, access to firmware, which controls the hardware, is not available.

Even if the source code is made public, significant challenges remain in the areas of authenticating that the code running systems in the field matches the publicly released code, and it is still possible to find attack vectors for open source systems.

In the 2004 United States presidential election, 32% of the voting was done on optical scan machines and 29% on DRE voting machines using trade secret proprietary software. As of February 2006, that figure had climbed to 49% for optical systems and 39% DRE.

Legislation has been introduced in the United States Congress to require public access to source code, hardware and firmware information, including the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2007, introduced by Congressman Rush D. Holt, Jr. The last action on this legislation (HR 811 110th Congress) was for it to be placed on the Union Calendar number 91 in June 2007.

<text>Pinnacle Entertainment Group is a publisher of role-playing games and wargames.

==History==
Shane Lacy Hensley wanted to create a 19th-century miniatures game so he contacted the company Chameleon Eclectic to get the game published. As a result &quot;Fields of Honor: The American War for Independence&quot; (1994) was published in partnership with Chameleon Eclectic, which dealt with functions such as distribution, while ownership of the game stayed with a new company that founded by Hensley named Pinnacle Entertainment Group. The next year, Pinnacle and Chameleon Eclectic published their last joint production, the collectible card game &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; (1995). When he completed the first draft of the game &quot;Deadlands&quot;, Hensley flew in two of his game designer friends, Greg Gorden and Matt Forbeck, who liked his design and asked if they could buy into the company; although Gordon later left the company for personal reasons, Forbeck moved to Blacksburg, Virginia to help build Pinnacle. &quot;Deadlands: The Weird West&quot; (1996) was published soon after as the first role-playing game and first independent publication released by Pinnacle.

==Description==
Pinnacle Entertainment Group is owned and operated by Shane Lacy Hensley and was founded in 1994. Some time before 2003, the company was renamed Great White Games and in 2005 returned to the original name. In 1996 the company published what would be their flagship title for several years &quot;Deadlands&quot;, a role-playing game set in an alternate-history U.S. of the 1870s. &quot;Deadlands&quot; features magic and horror amidst the tropes of the Old West. Later that year they would also publish &quot;Brave New World&quot;, a dystopian superhero role-playing game that used a simplified version of the &quot;Deadlands&quot; rules.

A second major line was introduced in 2001 called &quot;Weird Wars&quot; and features horror elements combined with a historical war setting. The first entrant in the Weird Wars line is &quot;Weird War II: Blood on the Rhine&quot; and uses the &quot;d20 System&quot; under the Open Gaming License from Wizards of the Coast. A second entry, &quot;Tour of Darkness&quot;, set during the Vietnam War, was released in 2004 using the &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; system.

In 2003, as Great White Games, they produced &quot;Savage Worlds&quot;, a game designed to be both a role-playing game and a miniatures game. A highly streamlined, generic system, it is designed to provide game play in any genre. Subsequent releases for &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; are self-contained campaigns designed to minimize the preparation time of the GM and maximize the time spent running the game with players. &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; carries the tag line &quot;Fast! Furious! Fun!&quot; to emphasize the streamlining and quick play inherent in the system.

In late 2005, Shane Hensley announced that Great White Games would return to using the Pinnacle Entertainment Group moniker as its brand name for subsequent releases.

<doc id="565399" wikidata="Q42645" url="?curid=565399" title="Havana Brown">
<text>The Havana Brown was the result of a planned breeding between Siamese and domestic black cats, by a group of cat fanciers in England, in the 1950s. Early breeders introduced an Oriental Siamese type Russian Blue into their breeding. However, using current genetic testing, it is believed that almost none remain in the gene pool.

It has been documented that self-brown cats were shown in Europe in the 1890s, one name given to these was the Swiss Mountain Cat. These disappeared until post-World War II, with the most likely explanation that the Siamese Cat Club of Britain discouraged their breeding. The Swiss Mountain Cat was never used in the breeding programs of the modern Havana Brown. However, they likely share genetics inherited from the Siamese.

== Breed development ==
In the early 1950s a group of English cat fanciers began working together with an intent to create a self brown cat of Foreign Type. They called themselves &quot;The Havana Group&quot;, later to become &quot;The Chestnut Brown Group&quot;. This group of breeders created the foundation of the Havana Brown cat of today. The ladies credited with this effort include Mrs. Armitage Hargreaves of Laurentide Cattery, Mrs. Munroe-Smith of Elmtower Cattery, the Baroness Von Ullmann of Roofspringer Cattery, Mrs. Elsie Fisher of Praha Cattery, and Mrs. Judd of Crossways Cattery. These breeders, by selectively breeding a Siamese cat which carried the chocolate gene to a black cat that also carried the chocolate gene, were able to produce chestnut (chocolate) coloured kittens.
=== Oriental-type ===
The breed continued to develop in the UK and became known as the Chestnut Brown Oriental and retained the Siamese conformation. Early in the breeding program, two kittens were also exported to Siamese breeders in the USA. Over the next decade, breeding took a different turn as genetic problems began to plague the new breed. It became necessary to utilise other breeds for genetic outcross and the phenotype began to evolve and develop into a different look than what the original breeders in England had intended. This change in direction tore apart the breeding group and caused many difficulties in continuing to progress the breed within the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Soon, the Chestnut Brown cat was being produced in many colours, known just as Oriental with a numeric system to designate the coat colour.

=== USA-type ===
In the US, the imported kittens continued to be crossbred with the chocolate and seal point Siamese, producing only chocolate or pointed offspring, with the breeders selectively breeding for only self brown kittens. Genetic diversity quickly resolved any defects that were seen in the early imports. The breeders in the US desired to maintain the look of the cats that were imported and bred specifically for brown offspring. Thus, the cats in the United States have a different look than the cats being bred in England. The American breeders focused on maintaining the unique head shape and did not breed for extremes. This American bred version was moderate in every way, with a rich, warm mahogany colour that consistently produced like offspring. The breed has been recognised for competition in the US since the late 1950s. In 1964, the Havana Brown was accepted for Championship status in the world&#x27;s largest feline registry, the Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA).
=== Suffolk ===
Early this century, a group of breeders in England again began trying to recreate the vision of the early Havana breeders. They made good progress in isolating the chocolate genetics and were consistently producing chocolate, lilac and pointed kittens. In 2011 a registered Havana Brown was imported from Europe and bred back to their Havana Orientals. This cats contribution, along with selective breeding for type, began to direct the look of some English Havanas away from its Oriental siblings, and moved them more in the direction of the Havana Brown. In June 2014 under the breed name Suffolk, this cat gained recognition by the GCCF. The alternative name was used because the GCCF uses the name Havana to refer to a self chocolate Oriental Shorthair, from which they wished to be distinguished. Although a Havana Brown is used in the breeding program of the Suffolk, they are not to be confused as the same breed. The Suffolk is much closer to the Chestnut/Havana Oriental than to the Havana Brown.

=== Popularity ===
The US-type Havana Brown has been considered an endangered breed, since the breeding pool is very small. As of 2024, there were only 15 catteries registered in the world with the majority of those (12) in North America. 

== Features and behavior ==
The Havana Brown is a well balanced, moderately sized, muscular short-haired cat with a body of average length. Sterilised animals can tend to become larger and somewhat chubby. They are a moderately active breed, compared to other short-hair cat breeds. The coat colour must be warm brown, typically reddish-brown, with no obvious tabby markings (note that kittens will always show markings but they resolve as the cat ages and dissolve completely by one year). Whiskers must also be brown and the eye colour green. The head should be slightly longer than wide, but should never appear like a wedge. In profile, the nose/muzzle should have a distinct stop and change in direction at the eyes. Paw pads must be pink or rose coloured but should never be black. Ears tend to be moderately large. A Havana Brown should have no extreme features; specimens should be attractive and moderate. Males tend to be larger than females and are average in weight compared with other breeds.

The Havana Brown is an intelligent cat that often uses its paws both to examine objects and to communicate with its owners. Curiosity brings them to the door as visitors arrive rather than preferring to be hidden as many cats will do. It is not unheard of for a Havana Brown to place paws on someone&#x27;s thigh and offer a meow of introduction. It is playful and curious, but rarely destructive unless left without companionship. While many are &#x27;lap cats&#x27;, a few are more content just to sit quietly beside their human companions. On the other hand, many Havana Browns prefer to ride on the shoulders of their human and help with daily activities. They love to play in and groom hair - it happens so frequently that there are Havana Brown owners who don&#x27;t even notice their cat doing it until it is pointed out by an observer. It is an odd trait that most Havana Browns share.

Havana Browns become very attached to their family and do not thrive when left alone for long periods. They are curious and interactive and need to be a part of daily activities. It is common for the Havana Brown to become best companions with the family dog. Many owners also find it surprising how easily they can travel with their Havana Brown without the cat&#x27;s objection.

The most likely explanation of the breed&#x27;s name - and the one most shared by Havana Brown devotees - is that its coat colour is very similar to that of the Havana cigars, however, some have also argued that the breed&#x27;s name is also derived from the Havana (rabbit) which also shares the colour. This is likely more accurate based on the recorded history in England.

Very little grooming is required. A gentle brushing and wipe with a damp cloth once or twice a week, along with a good quality diet, will suffice for Havana Browns.

There are no known genetic diseases associated with this breed. They may have a slightly higher occurrence of gingivitis than other breeds, this being attributed to their Siamese ancestry.

<text>Stouffville () is the primary urban area within the town of Whitchurch-Stouffville in York Region, Ontario, Canada. It is situated within the Greater Toronto Area and the inner ring of the Golden Horseshoe. The urban area is centred at the intersection of Main Street (York Regional Road 14), Mill Street, and Market Street. Between 2006 and 2011, the population of the Community of Stouffville grew 100.5% from 12,411 to 24,886, or from 51% to 66% of the total population of the larger town of Whitchurch-Stouffville. The population of Stouffville from the 2021 census is 36,753.

==History==
Founded in 1804 by Abraham Stouffer, the hamlet was originally named &quot;Stoufferville&quot;. Stouffer built a sawmill and grist-mill on the banks of Duffin&#x27;s Creek in the 1820s. The community name was shortened to Stouffville when its first post office opened in 1832.

In 1877, Stouffville became an incorporated village. On January 1, 1971, the Village of Stouffville amalgamated with Whitchurch Township and was designated a community within the larger town of Whitchurch-Stouffville; with amalgamation, the boundary of the town was also moved four farm lots south of the original boundary of Main Street (the land was formerly a part of Markham Township). The population of urban Stouffville in 1971 was 5,036.

In 2003, a large 16th-century Huron village was discovered in Stouffville during land development; approximately 2000 people once inhabited the site, dubbed Mantle Site, which included a palisade and more than 80 longhouses, yielding tens of thousands of artifacts.

==Geography==
Urban Stouffville is approximately 4.5 km long, stretching from the York-Durham Line to Highway 48, and approximately 2.7 km wide with development north and south of Main Street. Stouffville is bounded by farmland and a golf course. The community is located on the Oak Ridges Moraine and the Rouge River watershed.

==Transportation==
GO Transit&#x27;s Stouffville line passes through the community with commuter trains stopping at the Stouffville GO Station in the downtown core and terminating at Old Elm GO Station. When no trains are scheduled a bus service from Toronto serves the town with some runs continuing to Uxbridge.

York Region Transit&#x27;s bus#15 travels around the community of Stouffville and along the Stouffville Road to Yonge Street in Richmond Hill, and their bus#9 (9th line) travels from the town to Markham Stouffville Hospital and thence to Box Grove Plaza.

Stouffville Road (Regional Road #14) is the main east–west route that passes through downtown and connects with Highway 404 in the west.

==Demographics==
In 2006, urban Stouffville had a population of 8,000 to 10,000 people, or about one-third of the population of the larger Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville. The Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville estimates that the population grew more than 58% between 2006 and 2011; most of that growth was limited to the Community of Stouffville or the Community of Ballantrae. Based on the 2021 census the town&#x27;s total population is 36,753, growth of 8.8% from the 2016 population of 32,634.

==Growth==
With connection to a massive new sewage system (also known as the Big Pipe) and a water pipe from Lake Ontario, urban Stouffville began to grow rapidly after 2005. The first of the new subdivisions were south of Main Street along Hoover Park Drive (Wheler&#x27;s Mill and Wheler&#x27;s on Main subdivisions), and north of Main Street along Millard Street west of Ninth Line.

In 2008, construction began to widen Stouffville Road / Main Street from two lanes to four lanes, from Ninth Line to the edge of urban Stouffville at Highway 48 (the community of Ringwood), and further to McCowan Road. Construction was completed in June 2010. Stouffville Road has since been widened up to Highway 404.

===Stouffville Farmer&#x27;s Country Market / Downtown Farmer&#x27;s Market===

The town was home to the Farmers Country Market, founded 1952, which sold a variety of produce, prepared foods, live animals, and household items. While once a popular town attraction, the market closed in 2016 after years of decline. The land was sold in 2001 and was slated for re-development during the decade after the sale. Current barn, silo and stalls were demolished following the closure of the site in late 2016. The Liquidation Centre was moved online with pick-up location/cash and carry in Uxbridge, Ontario. Vendors either closed or relocated across the GTA.

Nearby was a downtown farmer&#x27;s street market hosted by the town and ran from 2009 to 2016. It too has closed and unsure if it will be opened again.

<text>Blackford &quot;Blackie&quot;/&quot;Black&quot; Oakes is a fictional character, a Central Intelligence Agency officer, spy and the protagonist of a series of novels written by William F. Buckley, Jr.

==Early life==
Oakes was born in 1925. He served in World War II as a fighter pilot and graduated from Yale University. Oakes is an engineer by training (at one point in the series, he is hired by an architectural firm), and Anthony Trust, ahead of Black at both Greyburn and Yale, recruits him for the Central Intelligence Agency in his senior year, 1951.

At Yale, Blackford is older than most of his classmates due to his military service. Reference is made to his membership on both the swimming and lacrosse teams there, and he is a member of Zeta Psi fraternity. Sally Partridge, a Vassar graduate, is his main love interest throughout the series. Their fateful meeting and Blackford&#x27;s courtship of Sally is detailed in Mongoose, R.I.P.

==Central Intelligence Agency==
Blackford&#x27;s missions with the CIA involve various top-secret Cold War enterprises arranged by the Agency&#x27;s highest ranking individuals and American presidents alike. Oakes possesses the ability to impress his colleagues, superiors (among them John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan), and even his enemies with his easy-going competence and likability.

==Personal life==
Oakes&#x27; personal life is somewhat hectic because of his constant globetrotting for the Agency, as he can never seem to find ample time to settle down with Sally, who yearns for the day when Blackford will retire from the CIA. Their respective worldviews are quite dissimilar, Oakes being conservative, and Sally, a liberal feminist who studied and teaches Jane Austen and admires Adlai Stevenson. While not only disliking Blackford&#x27;s chosen profession because it so often spoils their plans, Sally also disapproves of many of the ideals she believes the CIA represents.

While always holding Sally close to his heart, Oakes still finds plenty of time to pursue romantic conquests across the globe, often mixing work with pleasure. He is a suave, intelligent, and confident gentleman who is, in Buckley&#x27;s own words, distinctly American, and it is no surprise he succeeds in both work and play.

In &quot;Saving the Queen,&quot; Blackford&#x27;s address in 1975 is listed as 3025 P Street, NW.

Blackford is an avid reader of &quot;National Review&quot; but rarely offers insight into the state of domestic politics and world affairs.

==Characteristics==
Throughout the series, Blackford proves himself to be the ultimate Cold War warrior, and risks his life for the country he loves countless times, while looking smooth doing it.

Though Oakes is widely regarded as a gentleman, and at times, a charmer, he also has a rebellious streak in the face of unduly harsh authority. Blackford demonstrates this rebelliousness throughout the series, beginning with an incident involving the administration of Greyburn Academy, which Blackford briefly attends as a schoolboy.

<text>Bradford is the primary country urban area of the Town of Bradford West Gwillimbury, Ontario, in Canada. It overlooks a farming community, known as The Holland Marsh, located on the Holland River that flows into Lake Simcoe.

==History==
The eastern boundary of Bradford is the Holland River, named for Samuel Holland, first Surveyor General of British North America, who passed this way on an exploration from Toronto to Balsam Lake, by way of Lake Simcoe, in 1791.

For several years the Holland River and Lake Simcoe provided the only means of transportation. Holland Landing was the northern terminus of Yonge Street. The military route to Georgian Bay during the War of 1812 crossed Lake Simcoe to Kempenfelt Bay, then by the Nine Mile Portage to Willow Creek and the Nottawasaga River. The Penetanguishene Road, built between 1814 and 1815 from Kempenfelt Bay, provided an alternate route to Georgian Bay. However, early settlers also used this route to get to the frontier of Simcoe County, bypassing the areas of West Gwillimbury and Essa townships.

The first settlers to cross the Holland River, arriving in the fall of 1819, were three Irishmen: James Wallace, Lewis Algeo and Robert Armstrong. This was about the same time as the Auld Kirk Scotch Settlement was established. However, the pioneers of West Gwillimbury were mostly Protestants from Northern Ireland.

The new settlers sent a petition to the province of Upper Canada early in 1824, stating they were separated from the settlements of Yonge Street, by an impassable swamp. On January 24 the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada made a grant for the first main road in West Gwillimbury (4 Geo. 1V., chap 29). The contract for the first corduroy road across the Holland Marsh was completed by Robert Armstrong and his sons in the fall of 1825. Connecting with other contactors sections and the previously constructed road from Kempenfelt Bay, the road became known as Penetanguishene Road. It later became part of Yonge Street, and is now Simcoe County Road 4.

The original road (Bridge Street) did not curve onto Holland Street, but continued straight to what is now Scanlon Ave. near Colborne Street; from there the road continued north, while another road led southwest to the Scottish settlement. It was at this junction that the settlement was first established. William Milloy, formerly of Coulson&#x27;s Corners, built a small log tavern there in the fall of 1829. Other businessmen included James Drury, merchant; James Campbell, shoemaker and Thomas Driffel, blacksmith. John Peacock, an old soldier from London, England, had settled as a merchant and became the first postmaster in 1835.

===Name===
Initially, the place was known as &quot;Milloy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; and later was called &quot;Edmanson&#x27;s Corners&quot;. In 1840, Joel Flesher Robinson named it after his home town in West Yorkshire, England.

===Bradford becomes a town===

Bradford was incorporated as a village in 1857, with a population of about 1,000 people. Only a few years prior to this, the Northern Railway of Canada was built through the town. The train station was constructed by the Grand Trunk Railway and later used by the CNR. Bradford was incorporated as a town in 1960.

The Downtown Core has survived two fires. The first, on May 23, 1871, destroyed upwards of one hundred homes including all of the business part of the village except two hotels being consumed. However, a new downtown area arose where most buildings were made of brick. Today many of the buildings still exist and make up the downtown core. The second fire was in the 1960s with damage only to the northwest corner of the intersection at Highway 11 and Highway 88.

One of its famous historical landmarks that still operates to this day is the Village Inn Hotel. Its architect was E. J. Lennox, one of Toronto&#x27;s foremost architects who also built Toronto&#x27;s Old City Hall, the West Wing of the Ontario Legislative Building (known as Queen&#x27;s Park), and the King Edward Hotel. The Village Inn is situated at the crossroads of Highway 88 and Highway 11, and is the landmark at the four corners of Bradford. Food, lodgings, and hospitality serve as its trademark.
This history goes back to the 1900s, to horse and buggy days, when the Village Inn was a favourite meeting place for local residents and travellers en route for other parts of the country. The building survived a couple of fires including the great downtown fire of 1957. In 1980, it was hit by a crane that was trying to negotiate the intersection. It has since been extensively remodeled.

===Early industry===

The village of Bradford was established to supply the agricultural interests of its surrounding area, and for a brief period in the mid-19th century, lumbering was a major industry, as trees had to be removed in order to commence farming.

In 1824 entrepreneurs John Thorpe and Mark Scanlon obtained a government grant for the construction of a grist mill on a stream north of the settlement; although the partnership was dissolved about 1832, Scanlon built two sawmills in that vicinity. Water power being the only means of motive power at the time, as many as six mills were located on Scanlon Creek at one time. The family of Thomas Maconchy, one of the early settlers of Gilford, built a sawmill in Bradford at the bridge over the Holland River, in 1840. It was the first mill at that location.

When the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway was constructed, it was said to be through an almost continuous forest for most of the distance from Toronto to Barrie. Sometime after the line opened, Toronto lumber merchant Thompson Smith put up a large sawmill on the river near the Bradford station. First evidence of Smith in the village was 1862 when his partner James Durham cut the Holland River bridge in two, while driving logs to the mill.

Thompson Smith&#x27;s mill was the second largest in the area, next to the Sage mill at Bell Ewart. Smith added a second mill at Bradford, as well as contracting with Durham&#x27;s mill in Barrie. Only a decade after the arrival of the railway at Lake Simcoe, pine for the mills was running low. In 1867 H. W. Sage persuaded Thompson Smith to join with him in the formation of the Rama Timber Transport Company, to supply Lake Simcoe mills with timber. With logs coming from as distant as Head Lake, Smith put up a third mill, south of the Holland River bridge in 1869.

Following an example set by American lumberman Henry W. Sage, Thompson Smith established a number of mills at Cheboygan, Michigan.
In 1923, William Henry Day began the drainage system that turned the wetlands of the Holland Marsh into arable land, which now consists of thousands of acres where fresh vegetables are grown.

==Demographics==
The 2006 Statistics Canada Census lists the population of Bradford West Gwillimbury (the local census unit) as 24,039.
Bradford West Gwillimbury has people from many different backgrounds ranging from Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom, Hungary, and Ukraine. The overwhelming majority of Bradford&#x27;s residents are of European descent.

==Transportation==


Bradford&#x27;s downtown core is situated at the intersection of former Highway 11 (now, County Road 4) and 88 (now, County Road 88). County Road 88 interchanges with Highway 400, a limited-access freeway that connects to Toronto in the south and &quot;cottage country&quot; in the north. This portion of Highway 11 is one of the few connecting routes between Highway 404 to the east and the 400 to the west, creating considerable through traffic. It can be tough to drive through the town on long weekends.

The town&#x27;s local transit services consist of 2 bus routes, which are operated by the town&#x27;s local bus service, BWG Transit. GO Transit has bus routes that connect the town to Barrie and Newmarket, and Bradford also has a station on GO Transit&#x27;s commuter train network. The GO Train service had its first inaugural run through Bradford in 1982. At the time, the commuter train went as far north as Barrie. Over the years the service to Barrie was stopped. This caused Bradford to be a terminus for the commuter trains to Toronto. However, the City of Barrie purchased the rail line north of Bradford with the hope of reintroducing rail service to Barrie. GO Train service resumed as of December 2007 to the city of Barrie.

==Sports==
Bradford has two junior hockey teams that play in the GMHL; the Bradford Bulls and the Bradford Rattlers.

==Education==
There are 12 schools in the town, including two secondary schools:
* Bradford District High School (Public)
* Holy Trinity High School (Catholic).

Elementary schools include:
* Chris Hadfield Public School
* Fred C. Cook Public School

<text>Pender Island (Saanich: ) is the collective name for two Southern Gulf Islands located in the Salish Sea, British Columbia, Canada. The Pender Islands, consisting of North Pender Island and South Pender Island, have a combined area of approximately . The Islands are home to about 2,250 permanent residents, as well as a large seasonal population. Like most of the rest of the Southern Gulf Islands, the Pender Islands enjoy a sub-Mediterranean climate and feature open farmland, rolling forested hills, several lakes and small mountains, as well as many coves and beaches.

==Geography==
Pender Island consists of two islands, North Pender and South Pender, which are separated by a narrow canal originally dredged in 1903. In 1955 the islands were connected by a one lane bridge, as they remain today.

Most of the population and services reside on North Pender Island, with the highest concentration surrounding Magic Lake.

Sencot&#x27;en place names on Pender Island (&quot;st̕ey̕əs&quot;) include &quot;ʔiləčən&quot; (Bedwell Harbor), and &quot;x̣ʷəl̕isən̕&quot; (Port Browning). North Pender Island place names include:

* &quot;šxʷsəɬqʷsət&quot; (Shark Cove)
* &quot;x̣ʷəx̣ʷiʔéčsəŋ&quot; (Shingle Bay)
* &quot;kʷeqsən&quot; (Stanley Point)
* &quot;kʷeqsən&quot; (Boat Nook)
* &quot;təlasəŋ̕&quot; (Hope Bay)
* &quot;sq̕ʷəq̕ʷiŋ̕əs&quot; (Oaks Bluff)
* &quot;q̕eʔƛ̕əŋ&quot; or &quot;sq̕eʔəƛ̕əm&quot; (Otter Bay)
* &quot;x̣ʷiʔx̣ʷnəčénəm&quot; or &quot;sx̣ʷix̣ʷθəʔ&quot; (Wallace Point)

Similarly, a few geographic names on South Pender Island include the following:

* &quot;sk̕ʷən̕enxʷ&quot; (Gowlland Point)
* &quot;st&#x27;eyus&quot; (Bedwell Harbour)
* &quot;smanəč&quot; (Teece Point)

==History==

At the time of European Contact, Pender Island was inhabited by Coast Salish peoples speaking the North Straits Salish language. There is an Indian reserve at Hay Point on South Pender Island, which is home to members of the Tsawout and Tseycum First Nations. Carbon dating of artifacts in shell middens near Shark Cove identify an Indigenous village site that has been more or less continuously inhabited for five millennia. The Poets Cove Resort was built on an ancient First Nations village site. The provincial government&#x27;s 2007 settlement with the Tsawwassen First Nation included hunting and fishing rights on and around Pender Island—an arrangement to which the Sencot&#x27;en Alliance objected, saying those rights are theirs under the 1852 Douglas Treaty.

A Spanish expedition led by Francisco de Eliza visited Pender in 1791, naming it &quot;Ysla de San Eusevio&quot;. The islands, along with Pender Harbour on the Sunshine Coast, were given their current name by Captain Richards for Staff Commander, later Captain, Daniel Pender, RN who surveyed the coast of British Columbia aboard , , and from 1857 to 1870. The first permanent resident of European descent arrived on South Pender Island in 1886. Plumper Sound, the body of water between Mayne, Pender, and Saturna islands, is named for HMS &quot;Plumper&quot;.

In 1903, residents of Pender Island petitioned the government to dredge the isthmus between what is now North and South Pender Islands.

==Culture and Recreation==

Pender Island is a popular destination for fishing, boating, scuba diving, and other forms of outdoor recreation.

&quot;The Pender Islands Handbook&quot; is a 400-page traveler&#x27;s reference published by Richard Fox. It includes information on hiking, biking, boating, the history of the islands, and includes a navigational map. The most recent version is the 10th Anniversary Edition, published in 2016.

The &quot;Pender Post&quot; is the island&#x27;s locally-owned independent newspaper, which has been operating since 1971. The owner of another local news provider, &quot;Island Tides&quot;, went on sabbatical in the summer of 2017 and has not resumed publishing. 

The island has a &quot;9-hole golf course&quot;. Several residents pooled their funds in 1937 to purchase a parcel from George Grimmer, a son of Pender pioneer Washington Grimmer. These early investors planned and developed the layout of the golf course, which has operated ever since with the exception of a brief hiatus during World War II.

There is also a 27-hole disc golf course called &quot;Golf Island Disc Park&quot;, which is close to Magic Lake. It was founded in 1980 and is now maintained through the efforts of volunteers and the Pender Islands Park Commission. The course hosts disc golf tournaments including the Pender Island Invitational. 

Pender Island is also home to Canada&#x27;s first olive grove, called Waterlea Farm. 100 trees were originally planted by owner Andrew Butt with the goal of producing the first &quot;Made in Canada&quot; olive oil. As of December 2023 the property is for sale with 80+ trees listed as surviving.

=== Parks and beaches ===
Gulf Islands National Park Reserve has opportunities for boating, kayaking, hiking, camping and wildlife viewing. A difficult trail at Beaumont leads from the Ainslie Point parking lot to the shoreline via steep switchbacks that cut through dense temperate rainforest. The difficult trail at Mt. Norman ascends to a panoramic look-out with views of the San Juan Islands. The moderate trail at Roe Lake meanders through the Shingle Bay uplands to one of the Southern Gulf Island&#x27;s few freshwater lakes. At Roesland, visitors can explore a historic 1908 farmhouse which has been restored by members of the Pender Islands Museum Society.

=== Camping ===
Gulf Islands National Park Reserve has two options for campers on North Pender at this time: The drive-in, frontcountry sites at Prior Centennial Campground or the walk-in (or kayak-in) backcountry sites at Shingle Bay. Prior Centennial has 17 reservable sites and amenities include potable water, pit toilets, picnic tables and fire pits (seasonally available). Shingle Bay campground in the Roe Lake portion of the Reserve has 10 reservable primitive campsites with picnic tables and a pit toilet but no potable water. The walk/boat in sites at Beaumont on South Pender are closed for overnight camping until further notice as of summer 2022. Beaumont has 11 sites, and amenities include pit toilets and 15 mooring buoys for boaters, which remain open. There is no potable water at Beaumont and no campfires are permitted, regardless of season.

Private camping is available at Port Browning Marina. The sites are drive-in and frontcountry. Tents can be pitched anywhere on the large waterfront lawn of the marina. Small RV&#x27;s are also welcome but there are no hookups or dump station.

==Transport==

Pender Island can be accessed by regular ferry service provided by BC Ferries from Swartz Bay (near Victoria), Tsawwassen (near Vancouver), and other southern Gulf Islands, which dock in Otter Bay. There are also scheduled seaplane and water taxi services. On the Islands there is a system of &quot;car stops,&quot; Pender Island&#x27;s official alternative to hitch hiking. Conveniently located around the island you will find posts with maps, and often a handy chair. 

Pender Island also has a helicopter pad located near the main shopping mall, the Driftwood Centre. Select helicopters can also land at Fire Hall #1. Bedwell Harbour is an official port of entry for sailors from the United States; Port Browning and Otter Bay also offer anchorages.

<doc id="565448" wikidata="Q7356682" url="?curid=565448" title="Roderick Spode">
<text>Roderick Spode, 7th Earl of Sidcup, often known as Spode or Lord Sidcup, is a recurring fictional character in the Jeeves novels of English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse. In the first novel in which he appears, he is an &quot;amateur dictator&quot; and the leader of a fictional fascist group in London called the Saviours of Britain, also known as the Black Shorts. He leaves the group after he inherits his title.

He has a low opinion of Jeeves&#x27;s employer Bertie Wooster, whom he believes to be a thief. A large and intimidating figure, Spode is protective of Madeline Bassett to an extreme degree and is a threat to anyone who appears to have wronged her, particularly Gussie Fink-Nottle.

==Life and character==
Spode is a friend of Sir Watkyn Bassett, being the nephew of Sir Watkyn&#x27;s fiancée Mrs. Wintergreen in &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, though she is not mentioned again. He is intensively protective of Sir Watkyn&#x27;s daughter, Madeline Bassett, having loved her for many years without telling her. A violent man, he threatens to tear Bertie&#x27;s head off and make him eat it. Spode is a large and intimidating figure, with a powerful, square face. When he first sees Spode, Bertie describes him:

In Bertie&#x27;s eyes, Spode starts at seven feet tall, and seems to grow in height, eventually becoming nine feet seven. Bertie immediately thinks of Spode as &quot;the Dictator&quot; even before he learns of Spode&#x27;s political ambitions. As Bertie says, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if you have even seen those pictures in the papers of Dictators with tilted chins and blazing eyes, inflaming the populace with fiery words on the occasion of the opening of a new skittle alley, but that was what he reminded me of.&quot; Bertie learns how accurate his initial impression of Spode was when Gussie tells him that Spode is the leader of a fascist group called the Saviours of Britain, also known as the Black Shorts. Gussie says of Spode, &quot;His general idea, if he doesn&#x27;t get knocked on the head with a bottle in one of the frequent brawls in which he and his followers indulge, is to make himself a Dictator.&quot;

Like Bertie, Spode had been educated at Oxford; during his time there, he once stole a policeman&#x27;s helmet. While the leader of the Black Shorts, he is also secretly a designer of ladies&#x27; underclothing, being the proprietor of Eulalie Soeurs of Bond Street. Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia is a customer at Eulalie Soeurs and remarks that the shop is very popular and successful. Spode later inherits a title on the death of his uncle, becoming the seventh Earl of Sidcup. After being elevated to the peerage, he sells Eulalie Soeurs. At some point, he leaves the Black Shorts. Bertie says in &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot; that before Spode succeeded to his title, he had been &quot;one of those Dictators who were fairly common at one time in the metropolis&quot;, but &quot;he gave it up when he became Lord Sidcup&quot;. Despite Spode becoming Lord Sidcup, Bertie usually thinks of him as Spode, at one point addressing him as &quot;Lord Spodecup&quot;.

In &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, most of which takes place at Sir Watkyn&#x27;s country house, Totleigh Towers, Spode is the leader of the Black Shorts. He quickly starts to think of Bertie as a thief, believing that Bertie was trying to steal Sir Watkyn&#x27;s umbrella and also the silver cow-creamer from a shop. Spode threatens to beat Bertie to a jelly if he steals the cow-creamer from Sir Watkyn. Spode also antagonizes Gussie, for two reasons. First, Spode thinks Gussie is not devoted enough to Madeline, who is engaged to Gussie. Second, Gussie has insulted Spode in a notebook, writing that Spode&#x27;s mustache was &quot;like the faint discoloured smear left by a squashed blackbeetle on the side of a kitchen sink&quot;, and that the way Spode eats asparagus &quot;alters one&#x27;s whole conception of Man as Nature&#x27;s last word.&quot; With help from Jeeves and the Junior Ganymede club book, Bertie learns the word &quot;Eulalie&quot;, and tells Spode that he knows all about it. Spode, who does not want his followers to learn about his career as a designer of ladies&#x27; lingerie, is forced not to bother Bertie or Gussie. Spode is also blackmailed into taking the blame for the theft of Constable Oates&#x27;s helmet. Bertie does not learn the true meaning of &quot;Eulalie&quot; until the end of the story.

In &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;, which takes place at Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s country house, Brinkley Court, Spode has recently become Lord Sidcup. Bertie and his Aunt Dahlia plan to blackmail Spode with knowledge of &quot;Eulalie&quot; to keep Spode, who is a jewellery expert, from revealing that Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s pearl necklace is a fake (she pawned the real one to raise money for her magazine, &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot;). However, the blackmail plan is unsuccessful, because, as Spode tells Aunt Dahlia, he has sold Eulalie Soeurs. Aunt Dahlia ends up using a cosh she found on the ground to knock out Spode, which allows her to retrieve her fake necklace from a safe in order to hide it so it cannot be appraised. Later in the story, Spode identifies a different pearl necklace, one belonging to the Liverpudlian socialite Mrs. Trotter, as fake.

In &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, which takes place at Totleigh Towers, Spode is as protective of Madeline as ever and threatens to break Bertie&#x27;s neck when he thinks that he has caused Madeline to cry (she was shedding a tear because she thought Bertie was lovesick and could not stay away from her). Spode, seeing Gussie kiss Emerald Stoker, threatens to break Gussie&#x27;s neck as well and calls him a libertine. Harold Pinker steps forward to protect Gussie, and after Spode hits Pinker on the nose, Pinker, an expert boxer, knocks him out. Spode soon wakes up, but is knocked out again, by Emerald. Gussie leaves Madeline for Emerald, and Spode proposes to Madeline. She says that she must marry Bertie to reward his love for her, but Spode and Jeeves convince her that Bertie came to Totleigh to steal Sir Watkyn Bassett&#x27;s black amber statuette, not out of love for her. Madeline accepts Spode&#x27;s proposal.

In &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;, which takes place at Brinkley Court, Spode has been invited by Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia to Brinkley for his skills as an orator. He gives speeches in support of the Conservative candidate for Market Snodsbury, Harold &quot;Ginger&quot; Winship. As Spode&#x27;s fiancée, Madeline goes with him. After the success of his speeches, Spode considers standing for election himself for the House of Commons, which would require him to relinquish his title. Madeline, who wanted to gain the title Lady Sidcup, breaks their engagement, and says she will marry Bertie instead. After being hit by a potato at a lively candidate debate, Spode changes his mind about standing for Parliament and decides to retain his title, leading to a reconciliation between him and Madeline. They are still engaged at the end of the novel.

Although Spode regularly threatens to harm others, he is generally the one who gets injured. In &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, when Spode advances to attack Gussie, Gussie manages to hit him on the head with an oil painting. Spode&#x27;s head goes through the painting, and while he is briefly stunned, Bertie envelops him in a sheet. Bertie then hits Spode with a vase, but gets grabbed by Spode; Bertie frees himself by burning Spode with a cigarette. In other novels, Spode is knocked out three times: he is hit with a cosh by Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia in &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;, he is punched by Harold Pinker in &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, and Emerald Stoker smashes a china basin on his head in the same book. He is also hit in the eye with a potato at a candidate debate in &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;.

==The Black Shorts== 
The Saviours of Britain, nicknamed the Black Shorts, is a fictional fascist group led by Roderick Spode. Spode is modelled after Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists (1932–1940), who were nicknamed the &quot;Blackshirts&quot;. In &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, Spode is an &quot;amateur dictator&quot; who leads a farcical group of fascists called the Saviours of Britain, better known as the Black Shorts. Spode adopted black shorts as a political uniform because, as Gussie Fink-Nottle says, &quot;by the time Spode formed his association, there were no shirts left&quot;. This alludes to various radical groups: Mussolini&#x27;s Blackshirts, Hitler&#x27;s Brownshirts, the French Blueshirts and Greenshirts, the Irish Blueshirts and Greenshirts, the South African Greyshirts, Mexico&#x27;s Gold shirts, and the American Silver Shirts.

When Bertie Wooster rebukes Spode in &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; (1938), he mocks Spode&#x27;s black shorts, calling them &quot;footer bags&quot; (football shorts):

&quot;It is about time&quot;, I proceeded, &quot;that some public-spirited person came along and told you where you got off. The trouble with you, Spode, is that just because you have succeeded in inducing a handful of half-wits to disfigure the London scene by going about in black shorts, you think you&#x27;re someone. You hear them shouting &#x27;Heil, Spode!&#x27; and you imagine it is the Voice of the People. That is where you make your bloomer. What the Voice of the People is saying is: &#x27;Look at that frightful ass Spode swanking about in footer bags! Did you ever in your puff see such a perfect perisher?&#x27;&quot;

Like Mosley, Spode inherited a title upon the death of a relative; unlike Mosley, who inherited his baronetcy in 1928 (which entitled him to be called &quot;Sir&quot;) before forming his fascist group, Spode did not inherit his earldom (which made him &quot;Lord Sidcup&quot;) until after forming his group. Spode leaves the Black Shorts after gaining his title.

In the television series &quot;Endeavour&quot; (series five episode four – &quot;Colours&quot;), there is a reference to &quot;Spode and Webley&quot; being shot as fascists. (Webley is another fictional fascist leader, from Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Point Counter Point&quot;, and unlike Spode does end up being assassinated.)

==Adaptations==

===Television===

In the 1990–1993 television series &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, Spode was portrayed by John Turner. In this series, Spode, as the leader of the Black Shorts, is depicted as having an appearance somewhat similar to Mussolini. The Black Shorts are portrayed as a tiny group of around a dozen men and teenage boys dressed in uniforms like those of the Sturmabteilung. Their flag is similar in design to the flag of the British Union of Fascists (which used the party&#x27;s symbol, the Flash and Circle) and has the same flag colour scheme as the National Socialists.

Members of the Black Shorts comprise the small audience to whom Spode makes loud, dramatic Hitler-like speeches in which he announces bizarre statements of policy, such as giving each citizen at birth a British-made bicycle and umbrella. He also makes several statements revolving around root vegetables. In the original stories, none of Spode&#x27;s speeches are depicted and no other members of his group make an appearance. In both the television series and Wodehouse novels, Spode has a secret recorded in the Junior Ganymede Club&#x27;s book, involving a women&#x27;s lingerie shop named Eulalie.

===Stage===
* In the 1975 musical &quot;Jeeves&quot;, Spode was portrayed by John Turner, who also played Spode in the television series &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;. Differing from the novels, Spode is referred to as Sir Roderick Spode in the musical. The character was dropped from the 1996 rewrite titled &quot;By Jeeves&quot;, in which the closest equivalent character is Cyrus Budge III Jnr, who is original to the musical.
* In the 2013 play &quot;Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense&quot;, in which the events of &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; are reenacted by Bertie, Jeeves, and Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s butler Seppings, Spode is portrayed by Seppings.

===Radio===
* In the 1973–1981 radio drama series &quot;What Ho! Jeeves&quot;, Spode was voiced by James Villiers (&quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;) and Paul Eddington (&quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;). Spode is mentioned in the &quot;What Ho, Jeeves!&quot; adaptation of &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot; but does not have a speaking role. His actions are described by other characters.
* In the 1997 L.A. Theatre Works radio adaptation of &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, Spode was voiced by Martin Jarvis. Jarvis also voiced Jeeves in the same production, which was recorded live before an audience.
* In BBC Radio 4&#x27;s 2006 adaptation of &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; for its Classic Serial series, Spode was voiced by Jack Klaff.
* Adam Godley voiced Spode in the 2018 BBC radio adaptation of &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;.

<text>Icing, or frosting, is a sweet, often creamy glaze made of sugar with a liquid, such as water or milk, that is often enriched with ingredients like butter, egg whites, cream cheese, or flavorings. It is used to coat or decorate baked goods, such as cakes. When it is used between layers of cake it is known as a filling.

Icing can be formed into shapes such as flowers and leaves using a pastry bag. Such decorations are commonplace on birthday and wedding cakes. Edible dyes can be added to icing mixtures to achieve a desired hue. Sprinkles, edible inks or other decorations are often used on top of icing.

A basic icing is called a glacé, containing powdered sugar (also known as icing sugar or confectioners&#x27; sugar) and water. This can be flavored and colored as desired, for example, by using lemon juice in place of the water.

More complex icings can be made by beating fat into powdered sugar (as in buttercream), by melting fat and sugar together, by using egg whites (as in royal icing), by whipping butter into meringue (as in Italian or Swiss meringue buttercream), and by adding other ingredients such as glycerin (as in fondant) or dairy (as in ermine or cream cheese frosting).

Some icings can be made from combinations of sugar and cream cheese or sour cream, or by using ground almonds (as in marzipan).

Icing can be applied with a utensil such as a knife or spatula, or it can be applied by drizzling or dipping (see glaze), or by rolling the icing out and draping it over the cake. The method of application largely depends on the type and texture of icing being used. Icing may be used between layers in a cake as a filling, or it may be used to completely or partially cover the outside of a cake or other baked product.

Apart from its aesthetic functions, icing can also improve the flavor of a cake, as well as preserving it by sealing in moisture.

==History==

Covering cakes with powdered sugar or other materials was introduced in the 17th century. The first documented case of frosting occurred in 1655, and included sugar, eggs and rosewater. The icing was applied to the cake then hardened in the oven. The earliest attestation of the verb &quot;to ice&quot; in this sense seems to date from around 1600, and the noun &quot;icing&quot; from 1683. &quot;Frosting&quot; was first attested in 1750.

== Types ==

*Buttercream, made primarily of sugar and butter
*Fondant icing, heated water and sugar, sometimes with gelatin-like stabilizers
**Rolled fondant is rolled out like sugar cookies; a stiffer version can be used like sugar paste for three-dimensional sculptural modeling.
**Poured fondant is a thin, pourable glaze.
*Ganache, melted chocolate and cream
*Powdered sugar glacé, a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and a small amount of liquid (e.g., water). It may be poured, drizzled, spread, or, in thicker versions, piped.
*Meringue, cooked egg white and sugar.
**Some icings, such as Italian meringue buttercream, are meringues with butter added, in which case they are classified as buttercreams.
**Seven-minute frosting is a soft meringue. It does not store well.
*Royal icing, uncooked egg white and sugar. Dries hard and keeps for months.
*Whipped cream, may be used for decorating cakes. It does not store well.
*Ermine frosting, or boiled milk frosting, involves cooking flour and sugar with milk to make the frosting base. It is stable frosting making it suitable for cake decorating and is considered less sweet than buttercream.

<text>Leonid Genrikhovich Khachiyan (; ; May 3, 1952April 29, 2005) was a Soviet and American mathematician and computer scientist.

He was most famous for his ellipsoid algorithm (1979) for linear programming, which was the first such algorithm known to have a polynomial running time. Even though this algorithm was shown to be impractical, it has inspired other randomized algorithms for convex programming and is considered a significant theoretical breakthrough.

==Early life and education==
Khachiyan was born on May 3, 1952, in Leningrad to Armenian parents Genrikh Borisovich Khachiyan, a mathematician and professor of theoretical mechanics, and Zhanna Saakovna Khachiyan, a civil engineer. His grandparents were Karabakh Armenians. He had two brothers: Boris and Yevgeniy (Eugene). His family moved to Moscow in 1961, when he was nine. He received a master&#x27;s degree from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. In 1978 he earned his Ph.D. in computational mathematics/theoretical mathematics from the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and in 1984 a D.Sc. in computer science from the same institution.

==Career==
Khachiyan began his career at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, working as a researcher at the academy&#x27;s Computer Center in Moscow. He also worked as an adjunct professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. In 1979 he stated: &quot;I am a theoretical mathematician and I&#x27;m just working on a class of very difficult mathematical problems.&quot; Khachiyan immigrated to the United States in 1989. He first taught at Cornell University as a visiting professor. In 1990 he joined Rutgers University as a visiting professor. He became professor of computer science at Rutgers in 1992. By 2005, he held the position of Professor II at Rutgers, reserved for those faculty who have achieved scholarly eminence in their discipline.

==Work on linear programming==
===Ellipsoid method===
Khachiyan is best known for his four-page February 1979 paper that indicated how an ellipsoid method for linear programming can be implemented in polynomial time. The paper was translated into several languages and spread around the world unusually quickly. Authors of a 1981 survey of his work noted that it &quot;has caused great excitement and stimulated a flood of technical papers&quot; and was covered by major newspapers. It was originally published without proofs, which were provided by Khachiyan in a later paper published in 1980 and by Peter Gács and Laszlo Lovász in 1981. It was Gács and Lovász who first brought attention to Khachiyan&#x27;s paper at the International Symposium on Mathematical Programming in Montreal in August 1979. It was further popularized when Gina Kolata reported it in &quot;Science Magazine&quot; on November 2, 1979.

Khachiyan&#x27;s theory is considered a groundbreaking one that &quot;helped advance the field of linear programming.&quot; Giorgio Ausiello noted that the method was not practical, &quot;but it was a real breakthrough for the world of operations research and computer science, since it proved that the design of polynomial time algorithms for linear programming was possible and in fact opened the way to other, more practical, algorithms that were designed in the following years.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Khachiyan spoke Russian and English, but not Armenian. Bahman Kalantari noted that &quot;For some, his English accent wasn’t always easy to understand.&quot; A 1979 &quot;New York Times&quot; profile of him described Khachiyan as &quot;a relaxed, friendly young man in a sweater who speaks a little English, which he learned in high school.&quot;

He was known as &quot;Leo&quot; and &quot;Lenya&quot; to his friends and colleagues. Václav Chvátal described him as &quot;selfless, open, patient, sympathetic, understanding, considerate.&quot; Michael Todd, another colleague, described him as &quot;cynical about politics,&quot; &quot;very modest and kind to his friends,&quot; and &quot;intolerant of condescension and pomposity.&quot;

Khachiyan married Olga Pischikova Reynberg, of Russian-Jewish origin, in 1985. They had two daughters, Anna and Nina, who were teenagers at the time of his death. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2000. He died of a heart attack in South Brunswick, New Jersey on April 29, 2005, at the age of 52.

==Recognition==
In 1982 he was awarded the prestigious Fulkerson Prize by the Mathematical Programming Society and the American Mathematical Society for outstanding papers in the area of discrete mathematics, particularly his 1979 article &quot;A polynomial algorithm in linear programming.&quot;

Khachiyan was considered a &quot;noted expert in computer science whose work helped computers process extremely complex problems.&quot; He was called one of the world&#x27;s most famous computer scientists at the time of his death by Haym Hirsh, chair of the computer science department at Rutgers. &quot;Computer scientists and mathematicians say his work helped revolutionize his field,&quot; noted his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary. Bahman Kalantari, a friend and colleague at Rutgers, wrote: &quot;Surely, Khachiyan shall always remain to be among the greatest and most legendary figures in the field of mathematical programming.&quot;

<text>In ice hockey, icing is an infraction that occurs when a player shoots, bats, or deflects the puck from their own half (over the center red line) of the ice, beyond the opposing team&#x27;s goal line, without scoring a goal.

The icing rule has four variations: touch icing, no-touch or automatic icing, and hybrid icing. Many professional leagues use &quot;hybrid icing&quot;, while many amateur leagues worldwide use &quot;no-touch&quot; or &quot;automatic icing&quot;.

== Description ==
Icing is an ice hockey infraction. It occurs when a player shoots, bats with the hand or stick, or deflects the puck over the center red line and the opposing team&#x27;s red goal line, in that order, and the puck remains untouched without scoring a goal. The rule&#x27;s main purpose is preventing a defending team from delaying the game by, relatively easily, sending the puck to the other side of the rink to clear it from the opposing team&#x27;s attack.

=== Exceptions ===
Icing is waved off when any of the following occurs:
* The team committing the icing is shorthanded (except under USA Hockey rules in competitions for 14-and-under age groups).
* The linesman believes a player on the opposing team (other than the goaltender) could have played the puck before it crossed the goal line.
* The puck is iced directly from a player participating in a face-off.
* The goaltender leaves their goal crease and moves in the direction of the puck (except under USA Hockey rules).
* The goaltender touches the puck.
* The puck crosses the goal line between the goal posts of the opposing team; this scenario rewards a goal to the team which hit the icing. 
* The condition for touch icing or hybrid icing is met.

== Enforcement ==
Officials enforce the infraction. While an icing call is pending, the linesman raises an arm to indicate that a potential icing call may be made. If the icing is waved off, the official lowers their arm and gives the washout signal (extending both arms sideways from the body at shoulder height, similar to the &quot;safe&quot; sign in baseball but typically delivered from a less-crouched or fully upright position).

When icing occurs, a linesman stops play. Play is resumed with a faceoff in the defending zone of the attacking team, who committed the infraction. If there is a delayed penalty, it will happen at the attacking team&#x27;s neutral spot. If the linesman erred in stopping play for icing, the faceoff is at the center face-off spot (unless there is a delayed penalty).

==Variations==
The icing rule has three variations:
* &quot;touch icing&quot;
* &quot;no-touch&quot; or &quot;automatic icing&quot;
* &quot;hybrid icing&quot;

Currently, most leagues (IIHF, National Hockey League, American Hockey League, Kontinental Hockey League, NCAA college hockey, European professional leagues, and several minor North American leagues ECHL, Central Hockey League and SPHL) use &quot;hybrid icing&quot;. Most amateur leagues worldwide (such as USA Hockey) use &quot;no-touch&quot; or &quot;automatic icing&quot;.

===Touch icing===
In &quot;touch icing&quot;, a player in the opposing team other than the goaltender must touch the puck to cause the stoppage of play. If the puck is first touched by the goaltender or a player on the team that iced the puck, icing is &quot;waved off&quot; (canceled), and play continues. The &quot;touch icing&quot; rule can lead to high-speed races for the puck.

===No-touch or automatic icing===
In &quot;no-touch&quot; or &quot;automatic icing&quot;, play is stopped for icing as soon as the puck crosses the goal line.

===Hybrid icing===
In &quot;hybrid icing&quot;, play is stopped for icing if the player on the opposing team reaches the faceoff dot first, instead of skating all the way across the goal line to touch the puck.

This type of icing is intended to reduce the number of collisions along the boards during touch icing, while still allowing the team that iced the puck to get to it first to wave off the icing. When the puck is shot around the end boards, travels down the ice and comes out the other end, the linesman judges who would have touched the puck first. If it is the defending player, he calls icing, but if it is the attacking player, he waves off the icing and lets the play continue.

==History==

The National Hockey League (NHL) introduced the icing rule in September 1937 to eliminate a common delaying tactic used by teams to protect a winning margin. A November 18, 1931 game between the New York Americans and Boston Bruins is cited as one extreme example that led to the ban on the practice. The Americans, protecting a 3–2 lead over the Bruins at Boston Garden, iced the puck over 50 times. The crowd became incensed and threw debris onto the ice, causing a delay while the teams were sent to their dressing rooms. When the teams met again that December 3 in New York, the Bruins iced the puck 87 times in a scoreless draw.

The rule was amended in June 1951 to state the icing infraction was nullified if the goaltender touched the puck. For the 1990–91 season, the league again amended the rule, stating the infraction was nullified if the puck passed through or touched the goal crease when the goaltender had been removed for an extra attacker. The NHL amended the rule a third time; icing was nullified if the goaltender moved towards the puck as it approached the goal line.

The 1970s-era World Hockey Association (WHA) never adopted the NHL rule of allowing shorthanded teams to ice the puck. In 2009, USA Hockey considered eliminating the shorthanded icing rule, having tested its elimination in Massachusetts and Alaska in the 2007–2009 seasons.

The IIHF adopted the no-touch icing rule after an incident in the Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League in 1990, when Luděk Čajka, rushing to get to the puck in an icing situation, crashed into the boards, suffered severe spinal injuries, and died a few weeks later.

After some teams in need of a line change (player substitution) began deliberately icing the puck to stop play, and as part of a group of important rule changes following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NHL supplemented the icing rule prior to the 2005–06 season by not allowing the offending team to substitute players before the next faceoff, except to replace an injured player, when the goaltender must return to the net following an icing call. This change was made in an effort to speed up game play by reducing icing infractions, as well as to encourage teams to work the puck up the ice rather than taking the opportunity to rest their players. In some junior leagues (such as the WHL), the offending team is permitted to substitute players after an icing only if the puck was shot from the neutral zone (between the defensive blue line and the red line). If the violation occurs in the defensive zone, substitution is prohibited. Regardless, in all situations, if icing is called, and then a penalty is assessed that changes the on-ice strength of either team (from 5 on 5 to 5 on 4, for example), the offending team may substitute.

The NHL began using hybrid-icing rules in the 2013–14 season, after several decades of using touch icing, following the career-ending injury of Joni Pitkänen where he crashed against the boards when competing for the icing call. The IIHF also switched to hybrid after the conclusion of the 2014 World Championship.

On June 13, 2017, USA Hockey adopted a rule change that eliminated the shorthanded icing exception. The rule change establishes that when a shorthanded team ices the puck a subsequent icing infraction will be enforced; play will stop and a face-off will occur in the offending team&#x27;s zone. The rule change is effective starting with the 2017–18 regular season, impacting 14U and younger age groups.

Starting with the 2017–18 NHL season, offending teams are not allowed to take a timeout after an icing. In the 2019–20 NHL season a rule change allowed the offensive team to decide at which end zone dot they wished the face-off to be held following an icing (intended to grant a positional advantage to teams stronger on a certain side).

<doc id="565476" wikidata="Q466123" url="?curid=565476" title="Death and the Maiden (play)">
<text>Death and the Maiden () is a 1990 play by Chilean playwright Ariel Dorfman. The world premiere was staged at the Royal Court Theatre in London on 9 July 1991, directed by Lindsay Posner. It had one reading and one workshop production prior to its world premiere.

== Characters ==
* Paulina Salas — thirty-eight years old
* Gerardo Escobar — her husband, a lawyer, around forty-five
* Roberto Miranda — a doctor, around fifty

The setting is in the present time, in a country that is likely Chile but could be any nation that has recently transitioned from a long period of dictatorship to a democratic government. (The military dictatorship of Chile ended in March 1991, just before &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; premiered.)

== Synopsis ==
Paulina Salas is a former political prisoner from an unnamed Latin American country who was raped by her captors, including a sadistic doctor whose face she never saw. The doctor played Schubert&#x27;s String Quartet No. 14, subtitled &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;, during the act of rape, which gives the play its title.

Years later, after the repressive regime has fallen, Paulina lives in an isolated country house with her husband, Gerardo Escobar. When Gerardo returns home from a visit to the president, he gets a flat tire and is helped by a stranger named Dr. Miranda. Later that night, Dr. Miranda returns and Paulina recognizes his voice and mannerism as that of her rapist. She takes him captive in order to put him on trial and extract a confession from him.

Gerardo acts as Dr. Miranda&#x27;s lawyer and attempts to save his life, but after hearing the full story of Paulina&#x27;s captivity, he formulates a confession with Dr. Miranda based on the specific details Paulina shared with him. Paulina records the entire confession and has Dr. Miranda sign it. She then sends Gerardo to get Dr. Miranda&#x27;s car so he can go home. While they are alone for the last time, Paulina accuses Dr. Miranda of being unrepentant and guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. She shares that she purposely altered small details of her story when sharing it with Gerardo, and Dr. Miranda corrected those details in his own confession. Although Dr. Miranda denies this, Paulina is completely convinced of his guilt and prepares to execute him.

The play then skips forward in time, and the audience sees Paulina and Gerardo attending a concert. It is never revealed whether Paulina ultimately killed Dr. Miranda. As the concert orchestra begins to play Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;, Paulina sees Dr. Miranda across the room cast in a &quot;phantasmagoric&quot; light, and the audience is left to wonder whether he is truly there or only in Paulina&#x27;s mind.

<text>A status symbol is a visible, external symbol of one&#x27;s social position, an indicator of economic or social status. Many luxury goods are often considered status symbols. &quot;Status symbol&quot; is also a sociological term – as part of social and sociological symbolic interactionism – relating to how individuals and groups interact and interpret various cultural symbols.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;status symbol&quot; was first written in English in 1955, but from 1959 with the publication of the bestseller &quot;The Status Seekers&quot; greater distribution. There, journalist Vance Packard describes the social strategy and behavior in the USA.

== By region and time ==
As people aspire to high status, they often seek also its symbols. As with other symbols, status symbols may change in value or meaning over time, and will differ among countries and cultural regions, based on their economy and technology.

For example, before the invention of the printing press, possession of a large collection of laboriously hand-copied books was a symbol of wealth and scholarship. In later centuries, books (and literacy) became more common, so a private library became less-rarefied as a status symbol, though a sizable collection still commands respect.

In some past cultures of East Asia, pearls and jade were major status symbols, reserved exclusively for royalty. Similar legal exclusions applied to the toga and its variants in ancient Rome, and to cotton in the Aztec Empire. Special colors, such as imperial yellow (in China) or royal purple (in ancient Rome) were reserved for royalty, with severe penalties for unauthorized display. Another common status symbol of the European medieval past was heraldry, a display of one&#x27;s family name and history.

==Societal recognition==

Status symbols also indicate the cultural values of a society or a subculture. For example, in a commercial society, having money or wealth and things that can be bought by wealth, such as cars, houses, or fine clothing, are considered status symbols. Where warriors are respected, a scar can represent honor or courage. Among intellectuals being able to think in an intelligent and educated way is an important status symbol regardless of material possessions. In academic circles, a long list of publications and a securely tenured position at a prestigious university or research institute are a mark of high status. It has been speculated that the earliest foods to be domesticated were luxury feast foods used to cement one&#x27;s place as a &quot;rich person&quot;.

A uniform symbolizes membership in an organization, and may display additional insignia of rank, specialty, tenure and other details of the wearer&#x27;s status within the organization. A state may confer decorations, medals or badges that can show that the wearer has heroic or official status. Elaborate color-coded academic regalia is often worn during commencement ceremonies, indicating academic rank and specialty.

In many cultures around the world, diverse visual markers of marital status are widely used. Coming of age rituals and other rites of passage may involve granting and display of symbols of a new status. Dress codes may specify who ought to wear particular kinds or styles of clothing, and when and where specific items of clothing are displayed.

== Body modifications ==
The condition and appearance of one&#x27;s body can be a status symbol. In times past, when most workers did physical labor outdoors under the sun and often had little food, being pale and fat was a status symbol, indicating wealth and prosperity (through having more than enough food and not having to do manual labor). Now that workers usually do less-physical work indoors and find little time for exercise, being tanned and thin is often a status symbol in modern cultures.

Dieting to reduce excess body fat is widely practiced in Western society, while some traditional societies still value obesity as a sign of prosperity. Development of muscles through exercise, previously disdained as a stigma of doing heavy manual labor, is now valued as a sign of personal achievement. Some groups, such as extreme bodybuilders and sumo wrestlers use special exercise and diet to &quot;bulk up&quot; into an impressive appearance.

Ancient Central American Maya cultures artificially induced crosseyedness and flattened the foreheads of high-born infants as a permanent, lifetime sign of noble status. The Mayans also filed their teeth to sharp points to look fierce, or inset precious stones into their teeth as decoration.

== Material possessions ==
The ownership of luxury residences in exclusive locations has historically been considered one of the ultimate status symbols worldwide. Among the most coveted and recognized destinations globally are Portofino, a renowned location on the Italian Riviera, characterized by prestigious properties overlooking one of Europe&#x27;s most exclusive natural harbors; Lierna, offering a privileged view of Lake Como, historically associated with high aristocracy and international economic elites; and Monte Carlo, in the Principality of Monaco, a key hub for finance, luxury, and global high society. 

These residences, in addition to providing a high level of privacy and security, serve as genuine symbols of power and prestige, often linked to noble dynasties, prominent entrepreneurs, financial leaders, and influential figures on the international stage. The value of such properties is not merely determined by their strategic location or architectural features but, more importantly, by their function as instruments of social representation and status assertion, as access to them is often restricted even for those with immense wealth.

Luxury goods are often perceived as status symbols. Examples may include a mansion or penthouse apartment, a trophy wife, haute couture fashionable clothes, jewellery, or a luxury vehicle. A sizeable collection of high-priced artworks or antiques may be displayed, sometimes in multiple seasonally occupied residences located around the world. Privately owned aircraft and luxury yachts are movable status symbols that can be taken from one glamorous location to another; the &quot;jet set&quot; refers to wealthy individuals who travel by private jet and who frequent fashionable resorts.

Status symbols are also used by persons of much more modest means. In the Soviet Union before the fall of the Berlin Wall, possession of American-style blue jeans or rock music recordings (even pirated or bootlegged copies) was an important status symbol among rebellious teenagers. In the 1990s, foreign cigarettes in China, where a pack of Marlboro could cost one day&#x27;s salary for some workers, were seen as a status symbol. Mobile phone usage had been considered a status symbol (for example in Turkey in the early 1990s), but is less distinctive today, because of the spread of inexpensive mobile phones. Nonetheless Apple products such as iPhone are common status symbols among modern teenagers.

A common type of modern status symbol is a prestigious luxury branded item, whether apparel or other type of a good. The brand name or logo is often prominently displayed, or featured as a graphic design element of decoration. Certain brands are so highly valued that cheap counterfeit goods or knock-off copies are purchased and displayed by those who do not want to, or are unable to, pay for the genuine item.

<text>The mesopelagic zone (Greek μέσον, middle), also known as the middle pelagic or twilight zone, is the part of the pelagic zone that lies between the photic epipelagic and the aphotic bathypelagic zones. It is defined by light, and begins at the depth where only 1% of incident light reaches and ends where there is no light; the depths of this zone are between approximately 200 to 1,000 meters (~656 to 3,280 feet) below the ocean surface.

The mesopelagic zone occupies about 60% of the planet&#x27;s surface and about 20% of the ocean&#x27;s volume, amounting to a large part of the total biosphere. It hosts a diverse biological community that includes bristlemouths, blobfish, bioluminescent jellyfish, giant squid, and a myriad of other unique organisms adapted to live in a low-light environment. It has long captivated the imagination of scientists, artists and writers; deep sea creatures are prominent in popular culture.

==Physical conditions==
The mesopelagic zone includes the region of sharp changes in temperature, salinity and density called the thermocline, halocline, and pycnocline respectively. The temperature variations are large; from over 20 °C (68 °F) at the upper layers to around 4 °C (39 °F) at the boundary with the bathyal zone. The variation in salinity is smaller, typically between 34.5 and 35 psu. The density ranges from 1023 to 1027 g/L of seawater. These changes in temperature, salinity, and density induce stratification which create ocean layers. These different water masses affect gradients and mixing of nutrients and dissolved gasses. This makes this a dynamic zone.

The mesopelagic zone has some unique acoustic features. The Sound Fixing and Ranging (SOFAR) channel, where sound travels the slowest due to salinity and temperature variations, is located at the base of the mesopelagic zone at about 600–1,200m. It is a wave-guided zone where sound waves refract within the layer and propagate long distances. The channel got its name during World War II when the US Navy proposed using it as a life saving tool. Shipwreck survivors could drop a small explosive timed to explode in the SOFAR channel and then listening stations could determine the position of the life raft. During the 1950s, the US Navy tried to use this zone to detect Soviet submarines by creating an array of hydrophones called the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS.) Oceanographers later used this underwater surveillance system to figure out the speed and direction of deep ocean currents by dropping SOFAR floats that could be detected with the SOSUS array.

The mesopelagic zone is important for water mass formation, such as mode water. Mode water is a water mass that is typically defined by its vertically mixed properties. It often forms as deep mixed layers at the depth of the thermocline. The mode water in the mesopelagic has residency times on decadal or century scales. The longer overturning times contrast with the daily and shorter scales that a variety of animals move vertically through the zone and sinking of various debris.

== Biogeochemistry ==

=== Carbon ===
The mesopelagic zone plays a key role in the ocean&#x27;s biological pump, which contributes to the oceanic carbon cycle. In the biological pump, organic carbon is produced in the surface euphotic zone where light promotes photosynthesis. A fraction of this production is exported out of the surface mixed layer and into the mesopelagic zone. One pathway for carbon export from the euphotic layer is through sinking of particles, which can be accelerated through repackaging of organic matter in zooplankton fecal pellets, ballasted particles, and aggregates.

In the mesopelagic zone, the biological pump is key to carbon cycling, as this zone is largely dominated by remineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC). When a fraction of POC is exported from the euphotic zone, an estimated 90% of that POC is respired in the mesopelagic zone. This is due to the microbial organisms that respire organic matter and remineralize the nutrients, while mesopelagic fish also package organic matter into quick-sinking parcels for deeper export.

Another key process occurring in this zone is the diel vertical migration of certain species, which move between the euphotic zone and mesopelagic zone and actively transport particulate organic matter to the deep. In one study in the Equatorial Pacific, myctophids in the mesopelagic zone were estimated to actively transport 15–28% of the passive POC sinking to the deep, while a study near the Canary Islands estimated 53% of vertical carbon flux was due to active transport from a combination of zooplankton and micronekton. When primary productivity is high, the contribution of active transport by vertical migration has been estimated to be comparable to sinking particle export.
==== Particle Packaging and sinking ====
Mean particle sinking rates are 10 to 100 m/day. Sinking rates have been measured in the project VERTIGO (Vertical Transport in the Global Ocean) using settling velocity sediment traps. The variability in sinking rates is due to differences in ballast, water temperature, food web structure and the types of phyto and zooplankton in different areas of the ocean. If the material sinks faster, then it gets respired less by bacteria, transporting more carbon from the surface layer to the deep ocean. Larger fecal pellets sink faster due to lower friction-surface/mass ratio. More viscous waters could slow the sinking rate of particles.

=== Oxygen ===
Dissolved oxygen is a requirement for aerobic respiration, and while the surface ocean is usually oxygen-rich due to atmospheric gas exchange and photosynthesis, the mesopelagic zone is not in direct contact with the atmosphere, due to stratification at the base of the surface mixed layer. Organic matter is exported to the mesopelagic zone from the overlying euphotic layer, while the minimal light in the mesopelagic zone limits photosynthesis. The oxygen consumption due to respiration of most of the sinking organic matter and lack of gas exchange, often creates an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the mesopelagic. The mesopelagic OMZ is particularly severe in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and tropical Indian Ocean due to poor ventilation and high rates of organic carbon export to the mesopelagic. Oxygen concentrations in the mesopelagic are occasionally result in suboxic concentrations, making aerobic respiration difficult for organisms. In these anoxic regions, chemosynthesis may occur in which CO2 and reduced compounds such as sulfide or ammonia are taken up to form organic carbon, contributing to the organic carbon reservoir in the mesopelagic. This pathway of carbon fixation has been estimated to be comparable in rate to the contribution by heterotrophic production in this ocean realm.

=== Nitrogen ===
The mesopelagic zone, an area of significant respiration and remineralization of organic particles, is generally nutrient-rich. This is in contrast to the overlying euphotic zone, which is often nutrient-limited. Areas of low oxygen such as OMZ&#x27;s are a key area of denitrification by prokaryotes, a heterotrophic pathways in which nitrate is converted into nitrogen gas, resulting in a loss to the ocean reservoir of reactive nitrogen. At the suboxic interface that occurs at the edge of the OMZ, nitrite and ammonium can be coupled to produce nitrogen gas through anammox, also removing nitrogen from the biologically available pool.

== Biology ==

Although some light penetrates the mesopelagic zone, it is insufficient for photosynthesis. The biological community of the mesopelagic zone has adapted to a low-light environment. This is a very efficient ecosystem with many organisms recycling the organic matter sinking from the epipelagic zone resulting in very little organic carbon making it to deeper ocean waters. The general types of life forms found are daytime-visiting herbivores, detritivores feeding on dead organisms and fecal pellets, and carnivores feeding on those detritivores.

Many organisms in the mesopelagic zone move up into the epipelagic zone at night, and retreat to the mesopelagic zone during the day, which is known as diel vertical migration. These migrators can therefore avoid visual predators during the day and feed at night, while some of their predators also migrate up at night to follow the prey. There is so much biomass in this migration that sonar operators in World War II would regularly misinterpret the signal returned by this thick layer of plankton as a false sea floor. 
Estimates of the global biomass of mesopelagic fishes range from 1 gigatonne (Gt) based on net tows to 7–10 Gt based on measurements using active acoustics.

=== Virus and microbial ecology ===
Very little is known about the microbial community of the mesopelagic zone because it is a difficult part of the ocean to study. Recent work using DNA from seawater samples emphasized the importance of viruses and microbes role in recycling organic matter from the surface ocean, known as the microbial loop. These many microbes can get their energy from different metabolic pathways. Some are autotrophs, heterotrophs, and a 2006 study even discovered chemoautotrophs. This chemoautotrophic Archaea crenarchaeon &quot;Candidatus&quot; can oxidize ammonium as their energy source without oxygen, which could significantly impact the nitrogen and carbon cycles. One study estimates these ammonium-oxidizing bacteria, which are only 5% of the microbial population, can annually capture 1.1 Gt of organic carbon.

Microbial biomass and diversity typically decline exponentially with depth in the mesopelagic zone, tracking the general decline of food from above. The community composition varies with depths in the mesopelagic as different organisms are evolved for varying light conditions. Microbial biomass in the mesopelagic is greater at higher latitudes and decreases towards the tropics, which is likely linked to the differing productivity levels in the surface waters. Viruses however are very abundant in the mesopelagic, with around 1010 - 1012 every cubic meter, which is fairly uniform throughout the mesopelagic zone.

=== Zooplankton ecology ===
The mesopelagic zone hosts a diverse zooplankton community. Common zooplankton include copepods, krill, jellyfish, siphonophores, larvaceans, cephalopods, and pteropods. Food is generally scarce in the mesopelagic, so predators have to be efficient in capturing food. Gelatinous organisms are thought to play an important role in the ecology of the mesopelagic and are common predators. Though previously thought to be passive predators just drifting through the water column, jellyfish could be more active predators. One study found that the helmet jellyfish &quot;Periphylla periphylla&quot; exhibit social behavior and can find each other at depth and form groups. Such behavior was previously attributed to mating, but scientists speculate this could be a feeding strategy to allow a group of jellyfish to hunt together. Mesopelagic zooplankton have unique adaptations for the low light. Bioluminescence is a very common strategy in many zooplankton. This light production is thought to function as a form of communication between conspecifics, prey attraction, prey deterrence, and/or reproduction strategy. Another common adaption are enhanced light organs, or eyes, which is common in krill and shrimp, so they can take advantage of the limited light. Some octopus and krill even have tubular eyes that look upwards in the water column.
Most life processes, like growth rates and reproductive rates, are slower in the mesopelagic. Metabolic activity has been shown to decrease with increasing depth and decreasing temperature in colder-water environments. For example, the mesopelagic shrimp-like mysid, &quot;Gnathophausia ingens&quot;, lives for 6.4 to 8 years, while similar benthic shrimp only live for 2 years.

=== Fish ecology ===
The mesopelagic is home to a significant portion of the world&#x27;s total fish biomass. Mesopelagic fish are found globally, with exceptions in the Arctic Ocean. A 1980 study puts the mesopelagic fish biomass at about one billion tons. Then a 2008 study estimated the world marine fish biomass at between 0.8 and 2 billion tons. A more recent study concluded mesopelagic fish could have a biomass amounting to 10 billion tons, equivalent to about 100 times the annual catch of traditional fisheries of about 100 million metric tons. However, there is a lot of uncertainty in this biomass estimate. This ocean realm could contain the largest fishery in the world and there is active development for this zone to become a commercial fishery.

There are currently thirty families of known mesopelagic fish. One dominant fish in the mesopelagic zone are lanternfish (Myctophidae), which include 245 species distributed among 33 different genera. They have prominent photophores along their ventral side. The Gonostomatidae, or bristlemouth, are also common mesopelagic fish. The bristlemouth could be the Earth&#x27;s most abundant vertebrate, with numbers in the hundreds of trillions to quadrillions.

Mesopelagic fish are difficult to study due to their unique anatomy. Many of these fish have swim bladders to help them control their buoyancy, which makes them hard to sample because those gas-filled chambers typically burst as the fish come up in nets and the fish die. Scientists in California have made progress on mesopelagic fish sampling by developing a submersible chamber that can keep fish alive on the way up to the surface under a controlled atmosphere and pressure. A passive method to estimate mesopelagic fish abundance is by echosounding to locate the &#x27;deep scattering layer&#x27; through the backscatter received from these acoustic sounders. A 2015 study suggested that some areas have had a decline in abundance of mesopelagic fish, including off the coast of Southern California, using a long-term study dating back to the 1970s. Cold water species were especially vulnerable to decline.
Mesopelagic fish are adapted to a low-light environment. Many fish are black or red, because these colors appear dark due to the limited light penetration at depth. Some fish have rows of photophores, small light-producing organs, on their underside to mimic the surrounding environment. Other fish have mirrored bodies which are angled to reflect the surrounding ocean low-light colors and protect the fish from being seen, while another adaptation is countershading where fish have light colors on the ventral side and dark colors on the dorsal side.

Food is often limited and patchy in the mesopelagic, leading to dietary adaptations. Common adaptations fish may have include sensitive eyes and huge jaws for enhanced and opportunistic feeding. Fish are also generally small to reduce the energy requirement for growth and muscle formation. Other feeding adaptations include jaws that can unhinge, elastic throats, and massive, long teeth. Some predators develop bioluminescent lures, like the tasselled anglerfish, which can attract prey, while others respond to pressure or chemical cues instead of relying on vision.

==Human impacts==

===Pollution===

====Marine debris====

Marine debris, specifically in the plastic form, have been found in every ocean basin and have a wide range of impacts on the marine world.

One of the most critical issues is ingestion of plastic debris, specifically microplastics. Many mesopelagic fish species migrate to the surface waters to feast on their main prey species, zooplankton and phytoplankton, which are mixed with microplastics in the surface waters. Additionally, research has shown that even zooplankton are consuming the microplastics themselves. Mesopelagic fish play a key role in energy dynamics, meaning they provide food to a number of predators including birds, larger fish and marine mammals. The concentration of these plastics has the potential to increase, so more economically important species could become contaminated as well. Concentration of plastic debris in mesopelagic populations can vary depending on geographic location and the concentration of marine debris located there. In 2018, approximately 73% of approximately 200 fish sampled in the North Atlantic had consumed plastic.

====Bioaccumulation====
Bioaccumulation (a buildup of a certain substance in the adipose tissue) and biomagnification (the process in which the concentration of the substance grows higher as you rise through the food chain) are growing issues in the mesopelagic zone. Mercury in fish can be traced back to a combination of anthropological factors (such as coal mining) in addition to natural factors. Mercury is a particularly important bioaccumulation contaminant because its concentration in the mesopelagic zone is increasing faster than in surface waters. Inorganic mercury occurs in anthropogenic atmospheric emissions in its gaseous elemental form, which then oxidizes and can be deposited in the ocean. Once there, the oxidized form can be converted to methylmercury, which is its organic form. Research suggests that current levels anthropogenic emissions will not equilibrate between the atmosphere and ocean for a period of decades to centuries, which means we can expect current mercury concentrations in the ocean to keep rising. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin, and poses health risks to the whole food web, beyond the mesopelagic species that consume it. Many of the mesopelagic species, such as myctophids, that make their diel vertical migration to the surface waters, can transfer the neurotoxin when they are consumed by pelagic fish, birds and mammals.

===Fishing===

Historically, there have been few examples of efforts to commercialize the mesopelagic zone due to low economic value, technical feasibility and environmental impacts. While the biomass may be abundant, fish species at depth are generally smaller in size and slower to reproduce. Fishing with large trawl nets poses threats to a high percentage of bycatch as well as potential impacts to the carbon cycling processes. Additionally, ships trying to reach productive mesopelagic regions requires fairly long journeys offshore. In 1977, a Soviet fishery opened but closed less than 20 years later due to low commercial profits, while a South African purse seine fishery closed in the mid-1980s due to processing difficulties from the high oil content of fish.

As the biomass in the mesopelagic is so abundant, there has been an increased interest to determine whether these populations could be of economic use in sectors other than direct human consumption. For example, it has been suggested that the high abundance of fish in this zone could potentially satisfy a demand for fishmeal and nutraceuticals. With a growing global population, the demand for fishmeal in support of a growing aquaculture industry is high. There is potential for an economically viable harvest. For example, 5 billion tons of mesopelagic biomass could result in the production of circa 1.25 billion tons of food for human consumption. Additionally, the demand for nutraceuticals is also rapidly growing, stemming from the popular human consumption of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in addition to the aquaculture industry that requires a specific marine oil for feed material. Lanternfish are of much interest to the aquaculture market, as they are especially high in fatty acids.

=== Climate Change ===
The mesopelagic region plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, as it is the area where most of the surface organic matter is respired. Mesopelagic species also acquire carbon during their diel vertical migration to feed in surface waters, and they transport that carbon to the deep sea when they die. It is estimated that the mesopelagic cycles between 5 and 12 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per year, and until recently, this estimate was not included in many climate models. It is difficult to quantify the effects of climate change on the mesopelagic zone as a whole, as climate change does not have uniform impacts geographically. Research suggests that in warming waters, as long as there are adequate nutrients and food for fish, then mesopelagic biomass could actually increase due to higher trophic efficiency and increased temperature-driven metabolism. However, because ocean warming will not be uniform throughout the global mesopelagic zone, it is predicted that some areas may actually decrease in fish biomass, while others increase.

Water column stratification will also likely increase with ocean warming and climate change. Increased ocean stratification reduces the introduction of nutrients from the deep ocean into the euphotic zone resulting in decreases in both net primary production and sinking particulate matter. Additional research suggests shifts in the geographical range of many species could also occur with warming, with many of them shifting poleward. The combination of these factors could potentially mean that as global ocean basins continue to warm, there could be areas in the mesopelagic that increase in biodiversity and species richness, while declines in other areas, especially moving farther from the equator.

== Research and Exploration ==

There is a dearth of knowledge about the mesopelagic zone so researchers have begun to develop new technology to explore and sample this area. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), NASA, and the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research are all working on projects to gain a better understanding of this zone in the ocean and its influence on the global carbon cycle. Traditional sampling methods like nets have proved to be inadequate because they scare off creatures due to the pressure wave formed by the towed net and the light produced by the bioluminescent species caught in the net. 
Mesopelagic activity was first investigated by use of sonar because the return bounces off of plankton and fish in the water. However, there are many challenges with acoustic survey methods and previous research has estimated errors in measured amounts of biomass of up to three orders of magnitude. This is due to inaccurate incorporation of depth, species size distribution, and acoustic properties of the species. Norway&#x27;s Institute of Marine Research has launched a research vessel named Dr. Fridtjof Nansen to investigate mesopelagic activity using sonar with their focus being on the sustainability of fishing operations. To overcome the challenges faced with acoustic sampling, WHOI is developing remote operated vehicles (ROVs) and robots (Deep-See, Mesobot, and Snowclops) that are capable of studying this zone more precisely in a dedicated effort called the Ocean Twilight Zone project that launched in August 2018.

=== Discovery and Detection ===
The deep scattering layer often characterizes the mesopelagic due to the high amount of biomass that exists in the region. Acoustic sound sent into the ocean bounces off particles and organisms in the water column and return a strong signal. The region was initially discovered by American researchers during World War II in 1942 during anti-submarine research with sonar. Sonar at the time could not penetrate below this depth due to the large number of creatures obstructing sound waves. It is uncommon to detect deep scattering layers below 1000m. Until recently, sonar has been the predominant method for studying the mesopelagic.

The Malaspina Circumnavigation Expedition was a Spanish-led scientific quest in 2011 to gain a better understanding of the state of the ocean and the diversity in the deep oceans. The data collected, particularly through sonar observations showed that the biomass estimation in the mesopelagic was lower than previously thought.

=== Deep-See ===
WHOI is currently working on a project to characterize and document the pelagic ecosystem. They have developed a device named Deep-See weighing approximately 700 kg, which is designed to be towed behind a research vessel. The Deep-See is capable of reaching depths up to 2000 m and can estimate the amount of biomass and biodiversity in this mesopelagic ecosystem. Deep-See is equipped with cameras, sonars, sensors, water sample collection devices, and a real-time data transmission system.

=== Mesobot ===
WHOI is collaborating with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Stanford University, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley to develop a small autonomous robot, Mesobot, weighing approximately 75 kg. Mesobot is equipped with high-definition cameras to track and record mesopelagic species on their daily migration over extended periods of time. The robot&#x27;s thrusters were designed so that they do not disturb the life in the mesopelagic that it is observing. Traditional sample collection devices fail to preserve organisms captured in the mesopelagic due to the large pressure change associated with surfacing. The Mesobot also has a unique sampling mechanism that is capable of keeping the organisms alive during their ascent. The first sea trial of this device is expected to be in 2019.

=== MINIONS===
Another mesopelagic robot developed by WHOI are the MINIONS. This device descends down the water column and takes images of the amount and size distribution of marine snow at various depths. These tiny particles are a food source for other organisms so it is important to monitor the different levels of marine snow to characterize the carbon cycling processes between the surface ocean and the mesopelagic.

=== SPLAT cam ===
The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute has developed the Spatial PLankton Analysis Technique (SPLAT) to identify and map distribution patterns of bioluminescent plankton. The various bioluminescent species produce a unique flash that allows the SPLAT to distinguish each specie&#x27;s flash characteristic and then map their 3-dimensional distribution patterns. Its intended use was not for investigating the mesopelagic zone, although it is capable of tracking movement patterns of bioluminescent species during their vertical migrations. It would be interesting to apply this mapping technique in the mesopelagic to obtain more information about the diurnal vertical migrations that occur in this zone of the ocean.

<doc id="565536" wikidata="Q3417842" url="?curid=565536" title="Bathypelagic zone">
<text>The bathypelagic zone or bathyal zone (from Greek βαθύς (bathýs), deep) is the part of the open ocean that extends from a depth of below the ocean surface. It lies between the mesopelagic above and the abyssopelagic below. The bathypelagic is also known as the midnight zone because of the lack of sunlight; this feature does not allow for photosynthesis-driven primary production, preventing growth of phytoplankton or aquatic plants. Although larger by volume than the photic zone, human knowledge of the bathypelagic zone remains limited by ability to explore the deep ocean.

== Physical characteristics ==

The bathypelagic zone is characterized by a nearly constant temperature of approximately and a salinity range of 33-35 g/kg. This region has little to no light because sunlight does not reach this deep in the ocean and bioluminescence is limited. The hydrostatic pressure in this zone ranges from 100-400 atmospheres (atm) due to the increase of 1 atm for every 10 m depth. It is believed that these conditions have been consistent for the past 8000 years.

This ocean depth spans from the edge of the continental shelf down to the top of the abyssal zone, and along continental slope depths. The bathymetry of the bathypelagic zone consists of limited areas where the seafloor is in this depth range along the deepest parts of the continental margins, as well as seamounts and mid-ocean ridges. The continental slopes are mostly made up of accumulated sediment, while seamounts and mid-ocean ridges contain large areas of hard substrate that provide habitats for bathypelagic fishes and benthic invertebrates. Although currents at these depths are very slow, the topography of seamounts interrupts the currents and creates eddies that retain plankton in the seamount region, thus increasing fauna nearby as well

Hydrothermal vents are also a common feature in some areas of the bathypelagic zone and are primarily formed from the spreading of Earth&#x27;s tectonic plates at mid-ocean ridges. As the bathypelagic region lacks light, these vents play an important role in global ocean chemical processes, thus supporting unique ecosystems that have adapted to utilize chemicals as energy, via chemoautotrophy, instead of sunlight, to sustain themselves. In addition, hydrothermal vents facilitate precipitation of minerals on the seafloor, making them regions of interest for deep-sea mining.

== Biogeochemistry ==

Many of the biogeochemical processes in the bathypelagic region are dependent upon the input of organic matter from the overlying epipelagic and mesopelagic zones. This organic material, sometimes called marine snow, sinks in the water column or is transported within downward convected water masses such as the Thermohaline Circulation. Hydrothermal vents also deliver heat and chemicals such as sulfide and methane. These chemicals can be utilized to sustain metabolism by organisms in the region. Our understanding of these biogeochemical processes has historically been limited due to the difficulty and cost of collecting samples from these ocean depths. Other technological challenges, such as measuring microbial activity under the pressure conditions experienced in the bathypelagic zone, have also restricted our knowledge of the region. Although scientific advancements have increased our understanding over the past several decades, many aspects remain a mystery. One of the major areas of current research is focused on understanding carbon remineralization rates in the region. Prior studies have struggled to quantify the rates at which prokaryotes in this region remineralize carbon because previously developed techniques may not be adequate for this region, and indicate remineralization rates much higher than expected. Further work is needed to explore this question, and may require revisions to our understanding of the global carbon cycle.
=== Particulate organic matter ===
Organic material from primary production in the epipelagic zone, and to a far lesser extent, organic inputs from terrestrial sources, make up a majority of the Particulate Organic Matter (POM) in the ocean. POM is delivered to the bathypelagic zone via sinking copepod fecal pellets and dead organisms; these parcels of organic matter fall through the water column and deliver organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, to organisms that live below the photic zone. These parcels are sometimes referred to as marine snow or ocean dandruff. This is also the dominant delivery mechanism of food to organisms in the bathypelagic zone because there is no sunlight for photosynthesis, with chemoautotrophy playing a more minor role as far as we know.

As POM sinks through the water column, it is consumed by organisms which deplete it of nutrients. The size and density of these particles affect their likelihood of reaching organisms in the bathypelagic zone. Smaller parcels of POM often become aggregated together as they fall, which quickens their descent and prohibits their consumption by other organisms, increasing their likelihood of reaching lower depths. The density of these particles may be increased in some regions where minerals associated with some forms of phytoplankton, such as biogenic silica and calcium carbonate &quot;ballast&quot; resulting in more rapid transport to deeper depth.

=== Carbon ===
A majority of organic carbon is produced in the epipelagic zone, with a small portion transported deeper into the ocean interior. This process, known as the biological pump, plays a large role in the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere into the ocean. Organic carbon is primarily exported to the bathypelagic zone in the form of particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).

POC is the largest component of organic carbon delivered to the bathypelagic zone; it primarily takes the form of fecal pellets and dead organisms that sink out of the surface waters and fall toward the ocean floor. Regions with higher primary productivity where particles are able to sink quickly, such as equatorial upwelling zones and the Arabian Sea, have the greatest amount of POC delivery to the bathypelagic zone.

The vertical mixing of DOC-rich surface waters is also a process that delivers carbon to the bathypelagic zone, however, it constitutes a substantially smaller portion of overall transport than POC delivery. DOC transport occurs most readily in regions with high rates of ventilation or ocean turnover, such as the interior of gyres or deep water formation sites along the thermohaline circulation.

=== Calcium carbonate dissolution ===
The region in the water column at which calcite dissolution begins to occur rapidly, known as the lysocline, is typically located near the base bathypelagic zone at approximately 3,500 m depth, but varies among ocean basins. The lysocline lies below the saturation depth (the transition to undersaturated conditions with respect to calcium carbonate) and above the carbonate compensation depth (below which there is no calcium carbonate preservation). In a supersaturated environment, the tests of calcite-forming organisms are preserved as they sink toward the sea floor, resulting in sediments with relatively high amounts of CaCO3. However, as depth and pressure increase and temperature decreases, the solubility of calcium carbonate also increases, which results in more dissolution and less net transport to the deeper, underlying seafloor. As a result of this rapid change in dissolution rates, sediments in the bathypelagic region vary widely in CaCO3 content and burial.

== Ecology ==
The ecology of the bathypelagic ecosystem is constrained by its lack of sunlight and primary producers, with limited production of microbial biomass via autotrophy. The trophic networks in this region rely on particulate organic matter (POM) that sinks from the epipelagic and mesopelagic water, and oxygen inputs from the thermohaline circulation. Despite these limitations, this open-ocean ecosystem is home to microbial organisms, fish, and nekton.

=== Microbial ecology ===

A comprehensive understanding of the inputs driving the microbial ecology in the bathypelagic zone is lacking due to limited observational data, but has been improving with advancements in deep-sea technology. A majority of our knowledge of ocean microbial activity comes from studies of the shallower regions of the ocean because it is easier to access, and it was previously assumed that deeper water did not have suitable physical conditions for diverse microbial communities. The bathypelagic zone receives inputs of organic material and POM from the surface ocean on the order of 1-3.6 Pg C/year.

Prokaryote biomass in the bathypelagic is dependent and thus correlated with the amount of sinking POM and organic carbon availability. These essential organic carbon inputs for microbes typically decrease with depth as they are utilized while sinking to the bathypelagic. Microbial production varies over six orders of magnitude based on resource availability in a given area. Prokaryote abundance can range from 0.03-2.3x105 cells ml−1, and have population turnover times that can range from 0.1–30 years. Archaea make up a larger portion of the total prokaryote cell abundance, and different groups have different growth needs, with some archaea groups for example utilizing amino acid groups more readily than others. Some archaea like Crenarchaeota have Crenarchaeota 16S rRNA and archaeal amoA gene abundances correlated to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fixation. The utilization of DIC is thought to be fueled by the oxidation of ammonium and is one form of chemoautotrophy. Based on regional variation and differences in prokaryote abundance, heterotrophic prokaryote production, and particulate organic carbon (POC) inputs to the bathypelagic zone.

Research to quantify bacterial-consuming grazers, like heterotrophic eukaryotes, has been limited by difficulties in sampling. Oftentimes organisms do not survive being brought to the surface due to experiencing drastic pressure changes in a short amount of time. Work is underway to quantify cell abundance and biomass, but due to poor survival, it is difficult to get accurate counts. In more recent years there has been an effort to categorize the diversity of the eukaryotic assemblages in the bathypelagic zone using methods to assess the genetic compositions of microbial communities based on supergroups, which is a way to classify organisms that have common ancestry. Some important groups of bacterial grazers include Rhizaria, Alveolata, Fungi, Stramenopiles, Amoebozoa, and Excavata (listed from most to least abundant), with the remaining composition classified as uncertain or other.

Viruses influence biogeochemical cycling through the role they play in marine food webs. Their overall abundance can be up to two orders of magnitude lower than the mesopelagic zone, however, there is often high viral abundance found around deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The magnitude of their impacts on biological systems is demonstrated by the varying range of viral-to-prokaryote abundance ratios ranging from 1-223, this indicates that there are the same amount or more viruses than prokaryotes.

=== Fauna ===

==== Fish ecology ====
Despite the lack of light, vision plays a role in life within the bathypelagic with bioluminescence a trait among both nektonic and planktonic organisms. In contrast to organisms in the water column, benthic organisms in this region tend to have limited to no bioluminescence. The bathypelagic zone contains sharks, squid, octopuses, and many species of fish, including deep-water anglerfish, gulper eel, amphipods, and dragonfish. The fish are characterized by weak muscles, soft skin, and slimy bodies. The adaptations of some of the fish that live there include small eyes and transparent skin. However, this zone is difficult for fish to live in since food is scarce; resulting in species evolving slow metabolic rates in order to conserve energy. Occasionally, large sources of organic matter from decaying organisms, such as whale falls, create a brief burst of activity by attracting organisms from different bathypelagic communities.

==== Diel vertical migration ====
Some bathypelagic species undergo vertical migration, which differs from the diel vertical migration of mesopelagic species in that it is not driven by sunlight. Instead, the migration of bathypelagic organisms is driven by other factors, most of which remain unknown. Some research suggests the movement of species within the overlying pelagic region could prompt individual bathypelagic species to migrate, such as &quot;Sthenoteuthis&quot; sp., a species of squid. In this particular example, &quot;Sthenoteuthis&quot; sp. appears to migrate individually over the course of ~4–5 hours towards the surface and then form into groups. While in most regions migration patterns can be driven by predation, in this particular region, the migration patterns are not believed to result solely from predator-prey relations. Instead, these relations are commensalistic, with the species who remain in the bathypelagic benefitting from the POM mixing caused by the upward movement of another species. In addition, the vertical migrating species&#x27; timing bathypelagic appears linked to the lunar cycle. However, the exact indicators causing this timing are still unknown.

== Research and exploration ==

This region is understudied due to a lack of data/observations and difficulty of access (i.e. cost, remote locations, extreme pressure). Historically in oceanography, continental margins were the most sampled and researched due to their relatively easy access. However, more recently locations further offshore and at greater depths, such as ocean ridges and seamounts, are being increasingly studied due to advances in technology and laboratory methods, as well as collaboration with industry. The first discovery of communities subsisting off of the chemical energy in hydrothermal vents was aboard an expedition in 1977 led by Jack Corliss, an oceanographer from Oregon State University. More recent advancements include remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and independent gliders and floats.

== Climate change ==
The oceans act as a buffer for anthropogenic climate change due to their ability to take up atmospheric CO2 and absorb heat from the atmosphere. However, the ocean&#x27;s ability to do so will be negatively affected as atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise and global temperatures continue to warm. This will lead to changes such as deoxygenation, ocean acidification, temperature increase, and carbon sequestration decrease, among other physical and chemical alterations. These perturbations may have significant impacts on the organisms that dwell in the bathypelagic region and the properties that deliver organic carbon to the deep sea.

=== Carbon storage ===
The bathypelagic zone currently acts as a significant reservoir for carbon because of its sheer volume and the century to millennial timescales these waters are isolated from the atmosphere, this ocean zone plays an important role in moderating the effects of anthropogenic climate change. The burial of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the underlying sediments via the biological carbon pump, and the solubility pump of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into the ocean interior via the thermohaline conveyor are key processes for removing excess atmospheric carbon. However, as atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global temperatures continue to rise, the efficiency at which the bathypelagic will store and bury the influx of carbon will most likely decrease. While some regions may experience an increase in POC input, such as Arctic regions where increased periods of minimal sea ice coverage will increase the downward flux of carbon from the surface oceans, overall, there will likely be less carbon sequestered to the bathypelagic region.

<doc id="565544" wikidata="Q6372346" url="?curid=565544" title="Karl Weintraub">
<text>Karl Joachim &quot;Jock&quot; Weintraub (December 31, 1924, Darmstadt, Germany – March 25, 2004, Chicago, Ill.) was a longtime professor of history at the University of Chicago, having taught there since 1954. He was a strong proponent of liberal education and wrote and spoke extensively on its value.

Weintraub was born in Germany to parents of German and Russian-Jewish ancestry; in reaction to the increasing Nazi discrimination against Jews, they fled to the Netherlands in 1935, where they were forced into hiding during the Nazi occupation. During this time, Weintraub attended the Quaker Eerde School. He and his sister Tatjana Wood emigrated to the United States in 1948. He received his post-secondary education at the University of Chicago, attaining a B.A. in 1949, a Master&#x27;s in 1952, and a Ph.D. in History in 1957.

Weintraub&#x27;s scholarship focused on culture, autobiography, and the history of the self; he was the author of &quot;Visions Of Culture&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Value Of The Individual: Self and Circumstance in Autobiography&quot; (1978). Weintraub noted that 18th- and 19th-century autobiographical writers often used a narrative of &quot;development&quot; in their stories, as distinct from earlier autobiographies&#x27; use of a narrative of &quot;unfolding&quot;. He was a renowned teacher of the University of the Chicago&#x27;s core course in Western Civilization, which is still taught by his wife Katy O&#x27;Brien Weintraub. Weintraub&#x27;s classes, with a head count typically capped in the twenties, would attract hundreds of potential students and were some of the most popular classes at the college for many years.

<text>Proto-punk (or protopunk) is rock music from the 1960s to mid-1970s that foreshadowed the punk rock movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bangs (RS-2nd ed./Garage)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective label, the musicians involved were generally not originally associated with each other and came from a variety of backgrounds and styles; together, they anticipated many of punk&#x27;s musical and thematic attributes. The tendency towards aggressive, simplistic rock songs is a trend critics such as Lester Bangs have traced to as far back as Ritchie Valens&#x27; 1958 version of the Mexican folk song &quot;La Bamba&quot;, which set in motion a wave of influential garage rock bands including the Kingsmen, the Kinks, the 13th Floor Elevators and the Sonics. By the late 1960s, Detroit bands the Stooges and MC5 had used the influence of these groups to form a distinct prototypical punk sound. In the following years, this sound spread both domestically and internationally, leading to the formation of the New York Dolls and Electric Eels in the United States, Dr. Feelgood in England, and the Saints in Australia.

==Definition==
The &quot;AllMusic&quot; guide defined it as &quot;never a cohesive movement&quot; but as &quot;a certain provocative sensibility that didn&#x27;t fit the prevailing counterculture of the time&quot;, most of the time combined with a sound which was &quot;primitive and stripped-down, even when it wasn&#x27;t aggressive, and its production was usually just as unpolished&quot;. In contrast, in the book &quot;Screaming for Change&quot; (2010), it is defined as a specific sound which included simplistic instrumental work and amateurish compositions. The book cites this style as being pioneered in Detroit by the Stooges and MC5, who were influenced by the Velvet Underground and the earlier garage rock genre, with the sound then spreading to the United Kingdom, New York and Cleveland, Ohio.

== History ==
===Influences===
One of the earliest influences on both punk rock music and the punk subculture as a whole is folk musician Woody Guthrie. Beginning in the 1930s and becoming popular in the 1940s, Guthrie is often known as one of the first punks.

In the United Kingdom, the emergence of skiffle in the 1950s as a popular music movement is comparable to punk, in that skiffle similarly &quot;stripped music to its core&quot;, with its simplistic instrumental setup that &quot;[sending] out a clear anyone-can-do-it signal, and as the skiffle explosion proved, anyone could and did&quot;, according to PopMatters writer Ian Ellis. According to Aidan Smith in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, popular skiffle musician Lonnie Donegan embodied a &quot;dangerous and daring and do-it-yourself&quot; aesthetic that was later adopted by punk; Smith also commented that one of Donegan&#x27;s combos &quot;attracted a wild following: men so epicly drunk they&#x27;d wet themselves and – very proto-punk, this – their duffel-coats were accessorised with alarm clocks hung round necks.&quot; His 1957 British chart-topper &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot; has been referred to as &quot;the first punk No. 1&quot;; Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; writes: &quot;Lurching speed-freak skiffle played on Christ knows what which sounds nothing remotely like any previous chart-topper: if punk is anything, it might as well be that.&quot; Ellis writes: &quot;Forerunners of punk by 20 years, Donegan and the thousands of other skiffle acts that sprang up after &#x27;Rock Island Line&#x27; wrested control from the establishment, democratizing the industry in the process.&quot;

===1960s===

In his Book &quot;Protopunk: the Garage Bands&quot;, music journalist Lester Bangs traced the origins of punk to Ritchie Valens&#x27; 1958 version of the Mexican folk song &quot;La Bamba&quot;, due to the song&#x27;s simplistic three chord song structure and the aggressive vocals relative to the time. He places it first in a lineage of influential tracks, which over time developed punk: the Kingsmen&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (1963); the Kinks &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; (1964) and the Stooges&#x27; &quot;No Fun&quot; (1969). By the 1960s, garage rock a style of raw, loud and energetic rock music had developed significant scenes in both the United States and United Kingdom. The Kingsmen and the Kinks both came from the UK&#x27;s garage rock scene, with the former&#x27;s cover of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; being described by academic Aneta Panek as &quot;punk rock&#x27;s ur-text&quot;. Under the influence of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, the Kinks released &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; the following year, which was one of the earliest songs to make use of significant electric guitar distortion and was immediately influential for this reason. In the following years, this raw sound was being adopted by other British Invasion acts including the Who on their single &quot;My Generation&quot; (1965) and the Rolling Stones on their 1966 live album &quot;Got Live If You Want It!&quot;. In South America, the garage rock band Los Saicos formed in Lima, Peru in 1964, later being called &quot;the world&#x27;s first punk band&quot; in Zona de Obras&#x27; book &quot;Spanish Dictionary of Punk and Hardcore&quot;.

One of the earliest written uses of the term &quot;punk rock&quot; was by critic Dave Marsh who used it in 1970 to describe the garage rock group Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians in the United States, who had scored a major hit with their song &quot;96 Tears&quot; in 1966. While garage bands varied in style, the label of garage &quot;punk&quot; has been attributed by critic Michael Hann to the &quot;toughest, angriest garage rockers&quot; such as the 13th Floor Elevators and the Sonics. &quot;AllMusic&quot; states that bands like the Sonics and the Monks &quot;anticipated&quot; punk; the latter have likewise been cited as examples of proto-punk and the Sonics&#x27; 1965 debut album &quot;Here Are The Sonics&quot; as &quot;an early template for punk rock&quot;. The raw sound and outsider attitude of psychedelic garage bands like the Seeds also presaged the style of bands that would become known as the archetypal figures of proto-punk, other examples are the Electric Prunes (who writer Gath Cartwright states were &quot;embraced by the punks&quot; due to covers by the Damned and Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs), Red Crayola and Chocolate Watchband. The hit single &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot; from 1966 by the garage band Count Five featured fuzztone guitars and blazed the trail for punk rock, influencing the development of a new musical style. Not only did the unconventional sound of proto-punk bands go against what was popular in the mainstream, but the visual styles of many bands were purposely contrasted with more popular, polished aesthetics found in more well known bands.

Musically distinct from most other punk predecessors, New York&#x27;s the Velvet Underground were not aggressive, instead influencing punk through their avant-garde take on rock, which incorporated dissonance and taboo lyrical topics such as urban decay, drug addiction and sadomasochism. A 2014 article by the BBC stated that &quot;The roots of underground and experimental music, indie and alternative, punk, post-punk and art-punk all snake back to the four Velvet Underground studio albums&quot;.

===1970s===
In Japan, the anti-establishment , formed in 1969 and disbanded in 1975, mixed garage, psychedelic rock and folk; the band&#x27;s first two albums were withdrawn from public sale after their lyrics were described in Mark Anderson&#x27;s book &quot;The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture&quot; to violate industry regulations, with their &quot;spirit... [being] taken up again by the punk movement.&quot;

In the early 1970s, the UK underground counter-cultural scene centred on Ladbroke Grove in West London spawned a number of bands that have been considered proto-punk, including the Deviants, Pink Fairies, Hawkwind, Edgar Broughton Band, Stack Waddy, and Third World War; contemporaries Crushed Butler have been called &quot;Britain&#x27;s first proto-punk band.&quot; According to &quot;Allmusic&quot;, glam rock also &quot;inspired many future punks with its simple, crunchy guitar riffs, its outrageous sense of style, and its artists&#x27; willingness to sing with British accents (not to mention the idiosyncratic images of David Bowie and Roxy Music)&quot;. With his Ziggy Stardust persona, David Bowie made artifice and exaggeration central elements, ones that were later picked up by punk acts. The Doctors of Madness built on Bowie&#x27;s presentation concepts, while moving conceptually in the direction that would &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Simon Reynolds identified as &quot;prophes[ying] punk&quot;.

Bands anticipating the forthcoming movement were appearing as far afield as Düsseldorf, West Germany, where &quot;punk before punk&quot; band NEU! formed in 1971, building on the krautrock tradition of groups such as Can. Simply Saucer formed in Hamilton, Canada in 1973 and have been called &quot;Canada&#x27;s first proto-punk band&quot;, blending garage rock, krautrock, psychedelia and other influences to produce a sound that was later described as having a &quot;frequent punk snarl.&quot;

==== Origins ====

Debut albums by two key US proto-punk bands were released in 1969, both from Metro Detroit in Michigan; Detroit&#x27;s MC5 released &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; in January, and the Stooges, from Ann Arbor, premiered with their self-titled album in August. The sound of these albums influenced a wave of subsequent bands in Michigan, which notably included the Dogs, the Punks and Death, the latter a pioneering but commercially unsuccessful African-American proto-punk group. Formed in New York in 1971, the New York Dolls, merged Detroit&#x27;s specific proto-punk sound with elements of glam rock, pioneering the glam punk genre. A 2022 article by &quot;Alternative Press&quot; stated were &quot;the most important of all protopunk bands after the Stooges [sic]&quot;. Their style was adopted by a number of New York bands, including the Stilettos, the Brats and Ruby and the Rednecks, and subsequently was the catalyst for the city&#x27;s early punk rock scene, which included Television, Talking Heads, Patti Smith, the Ramones, Blondie and Richard Hell and the Voidoids. The Detroit proto-punk sound also spread to Cleveland Ohio by the middle of the decade, where influential proto-punk bands including Pere Ubu and the Electric Eels formed.

The immediate predecessor to British punk was the early to mid–1970s pub rock scene, which was mostly based around London. Influenced by Detroit proto-punk, this style made use of stripped down, back to its basics, rock music similar to punk, and was fronted by groups including Dr. Feelgood, Tyla Gang, Eddie and the Hot Rods and Count Bishops. Many of the early British punk scene&#x27;s musician began their careers in pub rock acts, including the 101ers (Joe Strummer, Richard Dudanski, Tymon Dogg), Kilburn and the High Roads (Ian Dury, Nick Cash) and Flip City (Elvis Costello). By 1976, pub rock had ultimately declined in popularity. At the same time as pub rock, the influence of the New York Dolls had spread to London, where a wave of glam punk bands, including Hollywood Brats and Jet, coalesced by the middle of the decade.

A new generation of Australian garage rock bands, inspired mainly by the Stooges and MC5, came even closer to the sound that would soon be called &quot;punk&quot;: in Brisbane, the Saints (formed in 1973) recalled the raw live sound of the British Pretty Things, who had made a notorious tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1965, while in Sydney, Radio Birdman, co-founded by Detroit expatriate Deniz Tek in 1974, began playing gigs to a small but fanatical following. The Saints are regarded as a punk band and as being &quot;to Australia what the Sex Pistols were to Britain and the Ramones to America,&quot; while Radio Birdman are regarded as co-founders of punk but have also been designated as proto-punk.

<text>Oakland is the academic and healthcare center of Pittsburgh and one of the city&#x27;s major cultural centers. Home to three universities, museums, hospitals, shopping venues, restaurants, and recreational activities, this section of the city also includes two city-designated historic districts: the mostly residential Schenley Farms Historic District and the predominantly institutional Oakland Civic Center Historic District, as well as the locally-designated Oakland Square Historic District.

In addition, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire operates Fire Station No. 14 on McKee Place and Fire Station No. 10 on Allequippa Street.

==Neighborhoods==

Oakland is officially divided into four neighborhoods: North Oakland, West Oakland, Central Oakland, and South Oakland. Each section has a unique identity, and offers its own flavor of venues and housing. Oakland is Pittsburgh&#x27;s second most populated neighborhood with 22,210 residents, a majority of these residents being students. Scattered amongst Oakland&#x27;s four neighborhoods are 29 distinct flights of city steps – many of which are open and in a safe condition. These Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and provide an easy way to travel through this densely populated area. As of 2020, two of these public stairways, Joncaire Street (Central Oakland) and Louisa Street (West Oakland), also contain runnels which allow cyclists to easily transport a bike up or down the flight.

=== North Oakland ===
North Oakland can be loosely defined as the area of Oakland between Neville and Bouquet Streets, encompassing all of Craig Street and running north to Polish Hill. The Cathedral of Learning, the engineering or midsection of the University of Pittsburgh campus, and the Craig Street business district are in North Oakland.

RAND&#x27;s Pittsburgh center is located in North Oakland as well as the long time RIDC business incubator on Henry Street. The Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, the largest mosque in the city, is located in North Oakland. This sector is also home to the Schenley Farms Historic District and many mid-rise condominium and apartment buildings.

=== Central Oakland ===
Central Oakland is bordered by Schenley Park, the Boulevard of the Allies, Fifth Avenue, and Halket Street. Many students at the University of Pittsburgh who decide to live off-campus reside in this neighborhood. Many of its homes are historic masonry structures dating from the turn of the century. The area is often confused with South Oakland. Its Main Business District runs along Forbes and Fifth Avenue, and contains a diversity of restaurants, retailers, and financial services. These businesses are organized by the Oakland Business Improvement District (OBID). Smaller business districts in Central Oakland provide additional dining options along Atwood Street and Semple Street. It is also the location of the relatively isolated and historic neighborhood of Panther Hollow which runs along Boundary Street in Junction Hollow as well as the Oakland Square Historic District.

=== South Oakland ===
South Oakland runs along the Monongahela River and forms a triangular shape between the Monongahela River, the Boulevard of the Allies, and the western bank of Junction Hollow. Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC and the Pittsburgh Technology Center are major landmarks of this neighborhood. The neighborhood is split between a riverfront flood plain to the southwest and a plateau to the northeast. The plateau is divided into two primarily residential areas which are separated from one another by Bates Street, which runs up a valley from the flood plain to the plateau. The residents of the neighborhood on the north side of Bates Avenue call their neighborhood Oakcliffe. The flood plain was previously packed with industrial sites such as the Pittsburgh Works Consolidated Gas Co. and the Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Co., but presently, the Pittsburgh Technology Center hosts facilities such as the Entertainment Technology Center of Carnegie Mellon University.

Many residents of Central Oakland - as well as news outlets - often consider their neighborhood part of South Oakland. However, the longstanding border between Central Oakland and South Oakland was established long ago along the Boulevard of the Allies. Forbes Avenue provides much of the neighborhood’s northern boundary.

South Oakland is reputed to be a student neighborhood, but only 36.9% of its population is between the ages of 18 and 24, compared to Central Oakland&#x27;s figure of 74.1%. The difference is largely because the area between Forbes Avenue and the Boulevard of the Allies houses many undergraduate students. While it is commonly considered to be in South Oakland, it is actually the heart of Central Oakland.

South Oakland was the childhood home of Andy Warhol, and later the residence of fellow pop artist Keith Haring. Haring had his first art show while living in Oakland. NFL Hall of Fame Quarterback Dan Marino was also born in Oakland, not far from Warhol&#x27;s home. Dan Marino Field on Frazier Street was named in honor of its native son. Although they were not contemporaries, Warhol and Marino grew up on the same block with their former houses only a few doors apart.

=== West Oakland ===
West Oakland is bordered by Fifth Avenue in the south, DeSoto Street in the east, the Birmingham Bridge to the west, and Aliquippa Street to the north. While the smallest of the Oakland districts, the neighborhood hosts a range of commercial and residential dwellings.

Among notable commercial operations exists Carlow University and most of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, including UPMC Presbyterian and UPMC Montefiore.

The residential makeup is diverse and consists of a number of long-time, permanent residents living alongside students completing their undergrad and graduate degrees. Many permanent residents have called West Oakland home dating back to around 1990, when a program to incentivize first time home buyers actively brought the neighborhood to life. Entertainment and residential life has a catalyst through The Corner, which hosts social events of all kinds. Here you can find pop up art displays to jazz nights, afterschool programs, and more.

=== Not Oakland ===

Although the campus of Carnegie Mellon University and parts of Schenley Park, including Phipps Conservatory &amp; Botanical Gardens and Flagstaff Hill are popularly referred to as being in Oakland, and are located with the 15213 zip code, they are actually part of the adjacent neighborhood of Squirrel Hill North. The border between Oakland and Squirrel Hill runs along Junction Hollow.

==History==
The name first appeared in 1839 in a local paper, &quot;Harris&#x27; Intelligencer&quot;. The area got its name from the abundance of oak trees found on the farm of William Eichbaum, who settled there in 1840. Oakland developed rapidly following the Great Fire of 1845 in Downtown Pittsburgh, with many people moving out to suburban territory. By 1860, there was considerable commercial development along Fifth Avenue.

In 1868, Oakland Township, just two years after seceding from Pitt Township, was annexed to the City of Pittsburgh. Twenty-one years later, Mary Schenley gave the city 300 acres in Oakland for a park. Officials bought another 100 acres from her for &quot;Schenley Park.&quot; And Mary Schenley gave another gift: land for Schenley Plaza. At Schenley Plaza, industrialist Andrew Carnegie built a library, museum and concert hall complex, which opened in 1895.

In 1917, Teddy Roosevelt visited the neighborhood.

Oakland has long been considered Pittsburgh&#x27;s university center. Carnegie Mellon University is the result of a 1967 merger of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, founded in Oakland in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie, and Mellon Institute, founded in 1913 by Andrew W. and Richard B. Mellon to conduct industrial research. The University of Pittsburgh, which is heir to the Pittsburgh Academy that was incorporated in 1787, relocated to Oakland in 1909 from its campus that was then in Allegheny.

Some of the most impressive architecture in Oakland is on Pitt&#x27;s campus. In 1925, work began on what was then the world&#x27;s tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning. Although the Cathedral of Learning is now the fourth-tallest educationally purposed building in the world, it remains the world&#x27;s second tallest university building, the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere, and the second tallest gothic-styled building in the world. Oakland is also home to the university&#x27;s French-Gothic revival Heinz Memorial Chapel and St. Paul Cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. It is also home of the main branch of the Carnegie Library, the Carnegie Museum, and Phipps Conservatory.

Baseball fans might know Oakland for the beloved Forbes Field, which was built in 1909 as the third home to the Pittsburgh Pirates and first home to the Pittsburgh Steelers. While Forbes Field was closed in 1970, some remnants of the ballpark still stand. Pirates fans gather on the site each year on the anniversary of Bill Mazeroski&#x27;s World Series winning home run on October 13, 1960.

The Decade nightclub was a staple of the neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Surrounding neighborhoods==
North Oakland has eight borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Bloomfield to the northeast, Shadyside and Squirrel Hill North to the east, Central Oakland to the south, West Oakland to the southwest, the Terrace Village region of the Hill District to the west, the Upper Hill District to the northwest Polish Hill to the north-northwest. North Oakland also runs catty-corner (without a direct border) with Lower Lawrenceville to the north with its meeting point in the middle of the Bloomfield Bridge.

Central Oakland has five Pittsburgh neighborhood borders, including North Oakland to the north, Squirrel Hill North to the northeast, Squirrel Hill South to the east, South Oakland to the south and southwest, and West Oakland to the northwest.

South Oakland has six land borders, including the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Central Oakland to the northeast, Squirrel Hill South to the east, Greenfield to the southeast, Hazelwood to the south-southeast, Bluff to the west, and West Oakland to the northwest. Across the Monongahela River, South Oakland runs adjacent with Pittsburgh&#x27;s South Side Flats neighborhood.

West Oakland has six borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of North Oakland to the northeast, Central Oakland to the southeast, South Oakland to the south and south-southeast, Bluff to the southwest, and the Crawford-Roberts and Terrace Village regions of the Hill District to the west and northwest, respectively.

<text>James Eli Watson (November 2, 1864July 29, 1948) was a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from Indiana. He was the Senate&#x27;s second official majority leader. While an article published by the Senate (see References) gives his year of birth as 1862, this is most probably incorrect.

==Early life==
He was born in Winchester, Indiana, one of six children. His father was a lawyer, a Republican state legislator, and owner-editor of the local newspaper, the &quot;Winchester Herald&quot;. At the age of twelve, Watson accompanied his father to the 1876 Republican National Convention. Watson attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana and graduated in 1886. At DePauw he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He then studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1886 and joined his father&#x27;s law firm.

==Political career==
Watson campaigned for Republican candidates throughout the 1880s and moved to Rushville, Indiana in 1893. He was elected as U.S. Representative from Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district in 1894 to the 54th Congress (1895–1897), defeating the incumbent Democratic William S. Holman, in part by speaking German, the language of many of his constituents.

He was defeated by Holman in 1896, but was elected from Indiana&#x27;s 6th congressional district in 1898 to the 56th Congress and reelected to the 57th, 58th, 59th and 60th Congresses (1899–1909).

Shortly after his arrival in Washington, Watson became the &quot;right-hand man&quot; and protégé of Speaker Joe Cannon. Cannon ensured his selection as the Republican whip, trusted him with party strategy in the House of Representatives, and placed him on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. While Cannon had his share of adversaries in the House, Watson enjoyed the attention of a wide circle of friends. An enthusiastic storyteller and poker player, he attracted members from both parties. Colleagues would come to the House chamber just to hear him speak—not to be swayed by his conservative views, but to see him put on a good show. As one writer observed, Watson &quot;would work himself up to an astonishing pitch, tear off his collar and necktie, then throw aside his coat and vest, until, clad in trousers, shirt, and suspenders, he could really let himself go.&quot;

Watson left the House to run for Governor of Indiana in 1908. Opposed by organized labor, he lost the election to Thomas R. Marshall, the future vice president under Woodrow Wilson. He resumed a private law practice in Rushville, though he continued to participate in Washington politics, supporting Cannon after House Democrats and Republican &quot;insurgents&quot; attempted to oust the speaker in 1909. The following year, Watson wrote Cannon&#x27;s famous speech defending the leadership&#x27;s authority, party government, and the rights of the majority. A pivotal moment in House history, the speech enabled Cannon to keep his position, but at a great reduction in power. The House adopted a resolution that prevented Cannon and subsequent speakers from serving on or appointing members to the all-important Rules Committee.
In the years after the House rebellion, Watson remained a prominent figure on Capitol Hill. Among other pursuits, he was a lobbyist for the American Manufacturers Association. While detractors, including members of the House, questioned the propriety of his new occupation, the criticism did not hurt his political standing in Indiana. In fact, he became known as an Indiana boss, and state politicians sought his endorsement as a necessary precursor to winning elections or appointments to higher office.

In 1916, Watson entered the U.S. Senate race against Democratic Senator John W. Kern, but his bitter primary battle against Harry S. New threatened to divide the state Republican party. Watson won the majority of primary delegates, but according to one source, New had &quot;convincing affidavits of fraud&quot; committed by Watson. As a result, Republican leaders could not decide which candidate to support. They were saved from making the decision when Indiana&#x27;s other senator, Benjamin F. Shiveley, died in March. Both Republican candidates ran for Senate seats in the general election. New defeated Kern, and Watson won the remainder of Shively&#x27;s term. He was reelected twice (1920 and 1926), serving from 1916 to 1933.

During his Senate tenure, he was
* majority leader 1929–1933
* chairman, Committee on Woman Suffrage (1919–21),
* chairman, Committee on Revision of the Laws (1919–21),
* chairman, Committee on Enrolled Bills (1923–25),
* chairman, Committee on Interstate Commerce (1925–1929),
* chairman, Republican Conference (1929–33)

In 1929, he was a defendant in a lawsuit wherein it was alleged by William M. Rogers, an avowed Klansman, that Watson had forced him to sign an affidavit recanting testimony before a Senate committee that Watson was also a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

The Democrats swept both Congress and the presidency in the election of 1932, and Watson lost his Senate seat in a landslide defeat. Following the election, however, Watson remained a fixture of the Washington scene, practicing law and trading stories with his former colleagues in the Republican cloakroom. He also retained, to a lesser degree, his power over Indiana politics. Wendell Willkie, a Republican convert and fellow Hoosier, could attest that Watson&#x27;s support, or lack thereof, meant everything in the state. When Willkie ran for president in 1940, Watson would not endorse the former Democrat. Reportedly, he justified his refusal by saying, &quot;I may welcome a repentant sinner into my church, but I wouldn&#x27;t want him to lead the church choir.&quot;

Watson is credited with originating the saying &quot;If you can&#x27;t lick &#x27;em, jine &#x27;em&quot;.

Watson died in 1948 in Washington D.C. at the age of 83. Dr. Frederick Brown Harris, the former Senate chaplain, performed the funeral service in Washington. Until the end, Watson remained well liked, if not well respected, by House and Senate members. Perhaps only Hoover and Willkie bore a lasting grudge against him. Indeed, even his harshest critics considered Watson the man &quot;impossible not to like&quot;. He is interred in Cedar Hill Cemetery, Suitland, Maryland.

<doc id="565584" wikidata="Q3423287" url="?curid=565584" title="Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>The Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge ( , ; &quot;Woodland of the Apache&quot;) is a National Wildlife Refuge located in southern New Mexico. It was founded in 1939 and is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It is a favorite spot to observe sandhill cranes, which spend the fall and winter in the area. The reserve is open year-round and provides safe harbor for its varied wildlife. Visitors to the refuge also enjoy partaking in activities such as hiking, cycling, driving tours on the 12-mile scenic auto route, and participating in educational programs offered on site.

==Location==

The name of the refuge means &quot;woodland of the Apache&quot; [] in Spanish, named for the Apache tribes that once camped in the forests along the Rio Grande. Previously, the Piro people had lived in the lands around what is now the refuge until the 1600s, when they were forced to abandon their pueblos due to European diseases and attacks from the Apache tribes.

The heart of the refuge comprises approximately of Rio Grande floodplain and of irrigated farms and wetlands. In addition to this, the refuge contains of arid grasslands and foothills of the Chupadera and San Pascual Mountains. The refuge sits within the Little San Pascual Mountain fault zone, rendering it an ideal site for conducting research on stratigraphy and sedimentology.

About of this is designated as wilderness. A twelve-mile-long (19 km) loop road divided by a cutoff into a &quot;Farm Loop&quot; and &quot;Marsh Loop&quot; allows automobile drivers excellent views of wetland wildlife and raptors, and there are several short (1.5 to 10 miles) walking trails. The road affords good views of the fields where crops are grown for the benefit of the birds under cooperative agreements with farmers. Adjacent to the Visitor&#x27;s Center, a desert plant garden is maintained.

== Terrain ==
About 7,000 acres (28 km2) in the center of the refuge are made up of flood-plains watered by irrigation systems connected to the Rio Grande. These flood-plains provide an essential habitat for cottonwood and honey mesquite trees, Goodding&#x27;s and coyote willows, and four-wing saltbushes. The plains are flooded periodically to give these plants the best growing conditions. In recent years, elk have caused damage to corn crops at the refuge. This damage disrupts the refuge&#x27;s capacity to supply supplemental food to the sandhill cranes and other waterfowl species that overwinter there.

The flood plains also grow foods for the wildlife that need marshlands to grow. These plants include smartweed, millet, bulrush, chufa, and various sedges. These marshlands begin dry, and are burned or turned over before they are flooded in order to produce fresh soil for the new plants. They are then flooded to become the breeding grounds for these marsh plants. The Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and the wetlands near the Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs demonstrate considerable promise for sustaining breeding bird populations over the course of the century. Similar suitable breeding terrain is found only on private land surrounding the refuge. Changes in surface flooding and vegetation structure are not affecting shrub-nesting birds who can use other woody debris for nesting; however, canopy nesting birds rely on native trees and are thus more sensitive to environmental changes.

The Bosque del Apache is also made up of several acres of dry land. One unit contains 5,440 acres (23 km2) of scrubland and desert terrain that is connected to the Chihuahuan desert. This area is called the Chupadera Peak Wilderness Unit. In addition to desert terrain, the Chupadera Peak Wilderness Unit is characterized by tall, reddish cliffs.

==Birds==
There have been 393 different bird species observed in the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge since 1964 according to eBird, making it one of the most diverse areas for bird species in the United States . The wetlands attract the huge flocks of wintering cranes and geese that are the refuge&#x27;s most interesting feature. Many other species—notably waterfowl, shorebirds, and birds of prey—also winter in the refuge. Striking vagrants such as a groove-billed ani and rufous-necked wood rail have been found there. In the Chihuahuan desert terrain outside of the Rio Grande riparian zone, the refuge also hosts three federally designated Wilderness areas (Chupadera, Little San Pascual, and Indian Well).

The diversity of birds is also high in spring, particularly the last week of April and first week of May, and in fall. In summer the area is hot but many water birds can be found, including such New Mexico rarities as the least bittern and occasionally the little blue heron. Late November to late February is the best time for large numbers of birds, typically over 10,000 sandhill cranes and over 20,000 Ross&#x27;s and snow geese. An annual &#x27;festival of the cranes&#x27; is held in early December as large numbers of cranes begin arriving in the refuge. Winter visitors generally plan to be in the refuge at sunrise or sunset, when the flocks of cranes and geese that roost in the refuge &quot;commute&quot; to or from local fields where they feed. Although winter sunsets and especially sunrises are chilly, the daily low temperature is seldom far below freezing. Visitors typically stay in the nearby RV park or in Socorro or San Antonio.

== Biology ==
In addition to hosting rare bird species, Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge is also home to the southernmost known population of the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse along the Rio Grande river. This mouse is a distinctive, genetically unique subspecies found in certain regions of New Mexico, Arizona, and southern Colorado. Due to its rarity, the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse has been listed as an endangered species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

An overabundance of the invasive tree species Tamarisk (also known as salt cedar) on the refuge has posed a threat to habitats utilized by native wildlife species. To combat this issue, Bosque NWR has utilized various control methods over time, such as mechanical removal, herbicide application, and prescribed burning. The Tamarisk removal efforts undertaken on the refuge have served as a case study for similar removal initiatives in other protected areas.

<text>The history of Greece encompasses the history of the territory of the modern nation-state of Greece as well as that of the Greek people and the areas they inhabited and ruled historically. The scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied throughout the ages and as a result, the history of Greece is similarly elastic in what it includes.

==Timeline==
Generally, the history of Greece is divided into the following periods:
*Prehistoric Greece: 
** Paleolithic Greece, starting circa 3.3 million years ago and ending in 20,000 BC. Significant geomorphological and climatic changes occurred in the modern Greek area which were definitive for the development of fauna and flora and the survival of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; in the region.
**Mesolithic Greece, starting in 13,000 BC and ending around 7,000 BC, was a period of long and slow development of primitive human &quot;proto-communities&quot;.
**Neolithic Greece, beginning with the establishment of agricultural societies around 7,000 BC and ending BC, was a vital part of the early history of Greece because it was the base for early Bronze Age civilizations in the area. The first organized communities developed and basic art became more advanced in Neolithic Greece.
**Bronze Age Greece () began with the transition to a metal-based economy during the Early Helladic period of mainland Greece (). Meanwhile, Cycladic culture prospered in the Cyclades () and Minoan civilization around Crete (). The Bronze Age ended with the rise and fall of the Mycenaean Greek palace culture (), sealed by the Late Bronze Age collapse.
*Ancient Greece usually encompasses Greek antiquity, as well as part of the region&#x27;s late prehistory (Late Bronze Age). It lasted from and can be subdivided into the following periods:
**Greek Dark Ages (or Iron Age, Homeric Age), 1,100–800 BC
**Archaic period, 800–490 BC
**Classical period, 490–323 BC
**Hellenistic period, 323–146 BC
**Roman Greece, covering the period of the Roman conquest of Greece from 146 BC – AD 324
*Byzantine Greece covers the period of Greece under the Byzantine Empire, lasting from the establishment of Constantinople as the capital city of Byzantium in AD 324 until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.
*Frankish/Latin Greece (including the Venetian possessions) lasted from the Fourth Crusade in 1204 to 1797, the year of the disestablishment of the Venetian Republic.
*Ottoman Greece covers the period of Ottoman occupation of Greece from 1453 until the Greek Revolution of 1821.
*Modern Greece covers the period from 1821 to the present.

At its cultural and geographical peak, Greek civilization spread from Egypt all the way to the Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan. Since then, Greek minorities have continued to inhabit former Greek territories (e.g. Turkey, Albania, Italy, Libya, Levant, Armenia, Georgia), and Greek emigrants have assimilated into differing societies across the globe (e.g., North America, Australia, Northern Europe, South Africa). At present, most Greeks live in the modern states of Greece (independent since 1821) and Cyprus.

==Prehistoric Greece==

===Pre-Paleolithic Period===
Fossils of one of the earliest pre-humans (&quot;Ouranopithecus macedoniensis&quot;, 10.6–8.7 million years ago), and of quite possibly the oldest direct ancestor of all humans (&quot;Graecopithecus&quot;, 7.2 million years ago) were found in Greece. In addition, 5.7 million year old footprints were found on the Greek island of Crete, which may suggest hominin evolution outside of Africa, contrary to current hypotheses.

=== Paleolithic Period ( 3.3M BC – 13000 BC) ===

The Paleolithic period is generally understudied in Greece because research has traditionally focused on the later parts of prehistory (Neolithic, Bronze Age) and the Classical times. Nevertheless, significant advances have been achieved over recent years, and the archaeological record has been enriched with new material, collected mostly in the framework of regional surveys but also through systematic or rescue excavations. New caves and rock shelters, as well as recently discovered and important open-air sites are now being excavated. The earliest undisputed traces of human habitation in the country, were discovered in Arcadia, Peloponnesus and date back 700,000 years. The Apidima Cave in Mani, southern Greece, contains the oldest known remains of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa, dated to 210,000 years ago. Currently known anthropological and archaeological finds allow the division of the Paleolithic in the Greek area into Lower (700,000–100,000 BP), Middle (100,000–35,000 BP) and Upper Palaeolithic (35,000–11,000 BP). There are, to date, few sites of the Lower Paleolithic, whereas there are more of the Middle and Upper. This is partly due to the intense tectonic activity in the Greek area and the rise and fall of the Aegean Sea which destroyed every trace of habitation from some geographical regions.

Paleolithic finds from Greece were first reported in 1867, but the first organized research on the sites was conducted many years later, between 1927 and 1931, by the Austrian archaeologist Adalbert Markovits. The first excavation of a Paleolithic site took place in 1942 at Seidi Cave in Boeotia by the German archaeologist Rudolf Stampfuss. More systematic research, however, was conducted during the 1960s in Epirus, Macedonia, Thessaly and the Peloponnese by English, American and German research groups.

=== Mesolithic Period (13000–7000 BC) ===

The Mesolithic in Greece occurred between the Upper Paleolithic and the Neolithic. Mesolithic sites in Greece were limited, and the majority are located near the coast. Franchthi Cave, the Kalamakia Cave in Mani (Peloponnese), the Asprochaliko Cave in Epirus (where the first excavation took place in 1960) and the Theopetra Cave are among the most important Mesolithic sites in Greece and Southeast Europe, and were inhabited almost continuously throughout the Paleolithic and the Mesolithic Period.

=== Neolithic Period to Bronze Age (7000–1100 BC) ===
The Neolithic Revolution reached Europe beginning in 7000–6500 BC when agriculturalists from the Near East entered the Greek peninsula from Anatolia by island-hopping through the Aegean Sea. The earliest known Neolithic sites with developed agricultural economies in Europe, dated 8500–9000 BP, were found in Greece. The first Greek-speaking tribes, speaking the predecessor of the Mycenaean language, arrived in the Greek mainland sometime in the Neolithic period or the Early Bronze Age ( 3200 BC).

====Cycladic and Minoan civilization====

The Cycladic culture is a significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age material culture from the Cyclades, best known for its schematic flat female idols carved out of the islands&#x27; pure white marble.

The Middle Bronze Age Minoan civilization in Crete lasted from . Little specific information is known about the Minoans, including their written system, which was recorded with the undeciphered Linear A script and Cretan hieroglyphs. Even the name &quot;Minoans&quot; is a modern appellation, derived from Minos, the legendary king of Crete. They were primarily a mercantile people engaged in extensive overseas trade throughout the Mediterranean region.

Minoan civilization was affected by a number of natural cataclysms, such as the volcanic eruption at Thera () and earthquakes (). In 1425 BC, all the Minoan palaces except Knossos were devastated by fire, which allowed the Mycenaean Greeks, influenced by the Minoans&#x27; culture, to expand into Crete. Remains of the Minoan civilization which preceded the Mycenaean civilization on Crete were first discovered in the modern era by Sir Arthur Evans in 1900, when he purchased and began excavating the site at Knossos.

Pre-Mycenean Helladic period

Following the end of the Neolithic, the last Stone Age period, the Early and Middle Helladic periods were established on the Greek mainland. The slow transition from the Final Neolithic period took place with the Eutresis culture (). Over hundreds of years, agricultural communities transitioned from stone tools to metal ones. Following such materialistic developments, more powerful micro-states and the base of the future Mycenean civilization were developed. Early Bronze Age settlements saw further development during Helladic III, exemplified by the Tiryns culture (), and the Middle Helladic period before the Mycenean period discussed below.

====Mycenaean civilization====

Mycenaean civilization originated and evolved from the society and culture of the Early and Middle Helladic periods in mainland Greece. It emerged , when Helladic culture was transformed under influences from Minoan Crete, and it lasted until the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces . Mycenaean Greece is the Late Helladic Bronze Age civilization of Ancient Greece, and it formed the historical setting of the epics of Homer and most of Greek mythology and religion. The Mycenaean period takes its name from the archaeological site Mycenae in the northeastern Argolid, in the Peloponnesos of southern Greece. Athens, Pylos, Thebes, and Tiryns also have important Mycenaean sites.

Mycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior aristocracy. Around 1400 BC, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, the center of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script Linear A to write an early form of Greek. The Mycenaean-era script is called Linear B, which was deciphered in 1952 by Michael Ventris. The Mycenaeans buried their nobles in beehive tombs (&quot;tholoi&quot;), large circular burial chambers with a high-vaulted roof and straight entry passage lined with stone. They often buried daggers or some other form of military equipment with the deceased. Nobility was also often buried with gold masks, tiaras, armor, and jeweled weapons. Mycenaeans were buried in a sitting position, and some of the nobility underwent mummification.

Around 1100–1050 BC, the Mycenaean civilization collapsed. Numerous cities were sacked, and the region entered what historians see as a &quot;dark age&quot;. During this period, Greece experienced a decline in population and literacy. The Greeks themselves have traditionally blamed this decline on an invasion by another wave of Greek people, the Dorians, although there is scant archaeological evidence for this view.

==Ancient Greece (1100–146 BC)==

Ancient Greece refers to a period of Greek history that lasted from the Greek Dark Ages () to the end of antiquity (). In common usage, it can refer to all Greek history beforeor includingthe Roman Empire, but historians tend use the term more precisely. Some include the periods of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, while others argue that these civilizations were so different from later Greek cultures that they should be classed separately. Traditionally, the Ancient Greek period was taken to begin with the date of the first Olympic Games in 776 BC, but most historians now extend the term back to about 1000 BC, toward the beginning of the Greek Dark Ages.

The Greek Dark Ages are succeeded by the Archaic period, which began and lasted until the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC. It was during this period that the Greek alphabet and early Greek literature developed, as well as the &quot;poleis&quot; (&quot;city-states&quot;) of Ancient Greece. With the end of the Dark Ages, Greeks spread to the shores of the Black Sea, Southern Italy (the so-called &quot;Magna Graecia&quot;) and Asia Minor. The Classical period began during the Greco-Persian wars in the 5th century BC and was marked by increased autonomy from the Persian Empire, as well as the flourishing of Ancient Greek democracy, art, theater, literature, and philosophy. The traditional date for the end of the Classical Greek period is the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, and the period that follows is termed the Hellenistic, ending with the rise of the Roman Empire at the end of the first millennium BC. Not everyone treats the Classical Greek and Hellenic periods as distinctsome writers treat the Ancient Greek civilization as a continuum running until the proliferation of Christianity in the 3rd century.

Ancient Greece is considered by many historians to be the foundational culture of Western civilization. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of Europe. Ancient Greek civilization has been immensely influential on the language, politics, educational systems, philosophy, art, and architecture of the modern world, particularly during the Renaissance in Western Europe and again during various neo-classical revivals in 18th- and 19th-century Europe and the Americas.

===Iron Age (1100–800 BC)===

The Greek Dark Ages ( BC) refers to the period of Greek history from the presumed Dorian invasion and end of the Mycenaean civilization in the 11th century BC to the rise of the first Greek city-states in the 9th century BC and the epics of Homer and earliest writings in the Greek alphabet in the 8th century BC.

The collapse of the Mycenaean civilization coincided with the fall of several other large empires in the near east, most notably the Hittite and the Egyptian. The cause is still somewhat mysterious, but has often been attributed to the invasion of hypothesized Sea Peoples wielding iron weapons. A hypothesized Dorian invasion may have also contributed, as asserted by ancient Greek legend but unsubstantiated by the archaeological record. Legend asserts that Dorians migrated down into Greece equipped with superior iron weapons, colonizing and easily dispersing the already weakened Mycenaeans. The period that follows these events is collectively known as the Greek Dark Ages.

Kings ruled throughout this period until eventually they were replaced with an aristocracy, then still later, in some areas, an aristocracy within an aristocracy—an elite of the elite. Warfare shifted from a focus on the cavalry to a great emphasis on infantry. Due to its cheapness of production and local availability, iron replaced bronze as the metal of choice in the manufacturing of tools and weapons. Slowly, however, equality grew among the different sects of people, leading to the dethronement of the various kings and the rise of the family.

At the end of this period of stagnation, the Greek civilization was engulfed in a renaissance that spread throughout the Greek world as far as the Black Sea and Spain. Writing was relearned from the Phoenicians, eventually spreading north into Italy and the Gauls.

===Archaic Greece===


In the 8th century BC, Greece began to emerge from the Dark Ages which followed the fall of the Mycenaean civilization. Literacy had been lost and Mycenaean script forgotten, but the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet, modifying it to create the Greek alphabet. From about the 9th century BC, written records begin to appear. Greece was divided into many small self-governing communities, a pattern largely dictated by Greek geography, where every island, valley, and plain is cut off from its neighbors by the sea or mountain ranges.

The Archaic period can be understood as the Orientalizing period, when Greece was at the fringe, but not under the sway, of the budding Neo-Assyrian Empire. Greece adopted significant amounts of cultural elements from the Orient, in art as well as in religion and mythology. Archaeologically, Archaic Greece is marked by Geometric pottery.

===Classical Greece===

The basic unit of politics in Ancient Greece was the &quot;polis&quot; (), sometimes translated as &quot;city-state&quot;. The term lends itself to the modern English word &quot;politics&quot;, which literally means &quot;the things of the &quot;polis&quot;&quot;. At least in theory, each &quot;polis&quot; was politically independent. However, some &quot;poleis&quot; were subordinate to others (e.g., a colony traditionally deferred to its mother city, and some had governments wholly dependent upon others (e.g., the Thirty Tyrants in Athens was imposed by Sparta following the Peloponnesian War), but the titularly supreme power in each &quot;polis&quot; was located within that city. This meant that when Greece went to war (e.g., against the Persian Empire), it took the form of an alliance going to war. It also gave ample opportunity for wars within Greece between different &quot;poleis&quot;.

====Persian Wars====
Two major wars shaped the Classical Greek world. The first was the Persian Wars (499–449 BC), recounted in the Greek historian Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot;. By the late 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Persian Empire ruled over all Greek city-states in Ionia (the western coast of modern-day Turkey) and had made territorial gains in the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper as well. In 499 BC, the Greek cities of Ionia, led by Miletus, revolted against the Persian Empire and were supported by some mainland cities, including Athens and Eretria. After the uprising had been quelled, Darius I launched the first Persian invasion of Greece to exact revenge on the mainland Greeks. In 492 BC, Persian general Mardonius led an army (supported by a fleet) across the Hellespont, re-subjugating Thrace and adding Macedonia as a fully-subjugated client kingdom. However, before he could reach Greece proper, his fleet was destroyed in a storm near Mount Athos. In 490 BC, Darius sent another fleet directly across the Aegean Sea (rather than following the land route as Mardonius had done) to subdue Athens. After destroying the city of Eretria, the fleet landed and faced the Athenian army at Marathon, which ended in a decisive Athenian victory. Darius&#x27;s successor, Xerxes I, launched the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC. Despite Greek defeat at Thermopylae, after which the Persians briefly overran northern and central Greece, the Greek city-states once again managed to comprehensively defeat the invaders with naval victory at Salamis and victory on land at Plataea.

To prosecute the war and then to defend Greece from further Persian attack, Athens founded the Delian League in 477 BC. Initially, each city in the League would contribute ships and soldiers to a common army, but in time Athens allowed (and then compelled) the smaller cities to contribute funds so that it could supply their quota of ships. Secession from the League could be punished. Following military reversals against the Persians, the treasury was moved from Delos to Athens, further strengthening the latter&#x27;s control over the League. The Delian League was eventually referred to pejoratively as the Athenian Empire.

In 458 BC, while the Persian Wars were still ongoing, war broke out between the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League, comprising Sparta and its allies. After some inconclusive fighting, the two sides signed a peace treaty in 447 BC. That peace was stipulated to last thirty years: instead, it held only until 431 BC, with the onset of the Peloponnesian War.

====Peloponnesian War====
The main sources concerning the Peloponnesian war (431404 BC) are Thucydides&#x27;s &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; and Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Hellenica&quot;. Both historians were also Athenian generals who lived through the war.

The war began in 431 BC over a dispute between the cities of Corcyra and Epidamnus. Corinth, an ally of Sparta in the Peloponnesian League, intervened on the Epidamnian side. Fearful lest Corinth capture the Corcyran navy (second only to the Athenian in size), Athens intervened. They prevented Corinth from landing on Corcyra at the Battle of Sybota, laid siege to Potidaea, and forbade all commerce with Corinth&#x27;s closely situated ally, Megara, with the Megarian decree.

There was disagreement among the Greeks as to which party violated the treaty between the Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues, as Athens was technically defending a new ally. The Corinthians turned to Sparta for aid. Fearing the growing might of Athens and witnessing Athens&#x27; willingness to use it against the Megarians (the embargo would have ruined them), Sparta declared the treaty violated, and the Peloponnesian War began in earnest.

The first stage of the war (known as the Archidamian War for the Spartan king Archidamus II) lasted until 421 BC with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. It began with the Athenian general Pericles recommending that his city fight a defensive war, avoiding battle against the superior land forces led by Sparta, and importing everything needful by maintaining its powerful navy. Athens would simply outlast Sparta, whose citizens feared leave their city for long lest the helots, a subjugated population of Sparta, revolt.

This strategy required that Athens endure regular sieges, and in 430 BC it was visited with an awful plague that killed about a quarter of its people, including Pericles. With Pericles gone, less conservative elements gained power in the city and Athens went on the offensive. In 425 BC, it captured 300–400 Spartan hoplites (soldiers) at the Battle of Pylos, a significant fraction of the Spartan fighting force which it could not afford to lose. Meanwhile, Athens suffered humiliating defeats at Delium in 424 BC and Amphipolis in 422. The Peace of Nicias in 421 concluded the first stage of the war, with Sparta recovering its hoplites and Athens recovering the city of Amphipolis.Those who signed the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC swore to uphold it for fifty years, but peace lasted only seven years. The second stage of the Peloponnesian War began in 415 BC when Athens embarked on the Sicilian Expedition in Magna Graecia to support its ally Segesta in Sicily against an attack by Syracuse (a Spartan ally also in Sicily) and conquer the island. Initially, Sparta was reluctant to help Syracuse, but Alcibiades, the Athenian general who had argued for the Sicilian Expedition, defected to the Spartan cause after being accused of grossly impious acts. Alcibiades convinced the Spartans that they could not allow Athens to subjugate Syracuse. The campaign ended in disaster for the Athenians.

After the Athenian defeat in Sicily, Athens&#x27; Ionian possessions rebelled with the support of Sparta, as advised by Alcibiades. In 411 BC, an oligarchical revolt in Athens held out the chance for peace, but the Athenian navy, which remained committed to the democracy, refused to accept the change and continued fighting in Athens&#x27; name. The navy recalled Alcibiades, who had been forced to abandon the Spartan cause after reputedly seducing the wife of Agis II, a Spartan king, and made him its head. The oligarchy in Athens collapsed and Alcibiades reconquered what had been lost for Athens.

In 407 BC, Alcibiades was replaced following a minor naval defeat at the Battle of Notium. The Spartan general Lysander, having fortified his city&#x27;s naval power, began winning victory after victory. Athens won the Battle of Arginusae in 406 BC but was prevented by bad weather from rescuing many of its sailors, leading the city to execute or exile eight of its top naval commanders. Lysander followed with a crushing blow at the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC which almost destroyed the Athenian fleet. Athens surrendered one year later, ending the Peloponnesian War and beginning a brief of period of Spartan hegemony in Greece.

The war left devastation in its wake. Discontent with Spartan hegemony from both Athenian and former Spartan allies led to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Backed by the Achaemenid Persian Empire, Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos significantly weakened Spartan military power, though unsuccessful in ending Spartan dominance. The war concluded with the Treaty of Antalcidas in 387 BC, in which Sparta was forced to cede Ionia and Cyprus to the Persian Empire. The Corinthian War and its aftermath further sowed the seeds of discontent in Spartan Greece, inducing the Thebans to attack once more. Their general, Epaminondas, crushed Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, inaugurating a period of Theban dominance in Greece.

In 346 BC, unable to prevail in its ten-year war with Phocis, Thebes called upon Philip II of Macedon for aid. Macedon quickly unified the Greek city-states under Macedonian hegemony into the League of Corinth in 338337 BC. In 336 BC, power was transferred to Philip&#x27;s son, Alexander the Great, who spent the next ten years conquering the Persian Empire and much of Western Asia and Egypt. By the age of 30, Alexander had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history&#x27;s greatest and most successful military commanders. After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, the Macedonian Empire disintegrated under widespread civil wars, beginning the Hellenistic Age of Greek history.

===Hellenistic Greece===
The Hellenistic period of Greek history begins with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and ends with the conquest of the Greek peninsula and islands by Rome in 146 BC. Although the establishment of Roman rule did not break the continuity of Hellenistic society and culture, which remained essentially unchanged until the advent of Christianity, it did mark the end of Greek political independence.

During the Hellenistic period, the importance of &quot;Greece proper&quot; (that is, the territory of modern Greece) within the Greek-speaking world declined sharply. The great centres of Hellenistic culture were Alexandria and Antioch, capitals of Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria, respectively. (See Hellenistic civilization for the history of Greek culture outside Greece in this period.)

Athens and her allies revolted against Macedon upon hearing that Alexander the Great had died in 323 BC, but were defeated within a year in the Lamian War. Meanwhile, a struggle for power broke out among Alexander&#x27;s generals, which resulted in the break-up of his empire and the establishment of a number of new kingdoms in the Wars of the Diadochi. Ptolemy was left with Egypt, and Seleucus with the Levant, Mesopotamia, and points east. Control of Greece, Thrace, and Anatolia was contested, but by 298 BC the Antigonid dynasty had supplanted the Antipatrid.

Macedonian control of the city-states was intermittent, with a number of revolts. Athens, Rhodes, Pergamum, and other Greek states retained substantial independence and joined the Aetolian League as a means of defending it and restoring democracy in their states, as they saw Macedon as a tyrannical kingdom. The Achaean League, while nominally subject to the Ptolemies, was in effect independent, and controlled most of southern Greece. Sparta also remained independent, but generally refused to join any league.
In 267 BC, Ptolemy II persuaded the Greek cities to revolt against Macedon in what became the Chremonidean War, named after the Athenian leader Chremonides. The cities were defeated and Athens lost her independence and democratic institutions. This marked the end of Athens as a political actor, although it remained the largest, wealthiest, and most cultivated city in Greece. In 225 BC, Macedon defeated the Egyptian fleet at Cos and brought the Aegean islands, except Rhodes, under its rule as well.

Sparta remained hostile to the Achaeans, and in 227 BC it invaded Achaea and seized control of the League. The remaining Achaeans preferred distant Macedon to nearby Sparta and allied with the former. In 222 BC, the Macedonian army defeated the Spartans and annexed their city—the first time Sparta had ever been occupied by a different state.

Philip V of Macedon was the last Greek ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite Greece and preserve its independence against the ever-increasing power of Rome. Under his auspices, the Peace of Naupactus (217 BC) brought conflict between Macedon and the Greek leagues to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes, and Pergamum.

In 215 BC, however, Philip formed an alliance with Rome&#x27;s enemy Carthage. Rome promptly lured the Achaean cities away from their nominal loyalty to Philip, and formed alliances with Rhodes and Pergamum, now the strongest power in Asia Minor. The First Macedonian War broke out in 212 BC and ended inconclusively in 205 BC, but Macedon was now marked as an enemy of Rome.

In 202 BC, Rome defeated Carthage and was free to turn her attention eastwards. In 198 BC, the Second Macedonian War broke out because Rome saw Macedon as a potential ally of the Seleucid Empire, the greatest power in the East. Philip&#x27;s allies in Greece deserted him, and in 197 BC he was decisively defeated at the Battle of Cynoscephalae by the Roman proconsul Titus Quinctius Flaminius.

Luckily for the Greeks, Flaminius was a moderate man and an admirer of Greek culture. Philip had to surrender his fleet and become a Roman ally, but he was otherwise spared. At the Isthmian Games in 196 BC, Flaminius declared all the Greek cities free, although Roman garrisons were placed at Corinth and Chalcis. But the freedom promised by Rome was an illusion. All the cities except Rhodes were enrolled in a new League which Rome ultimately controlled, and aristocratic constitutions were favored and actively promoted.

==Roman Greece (146 BC – AD 324)==


In the 2nd century BC, Greece was conquered by the Roman Republic and came under its control. Still, Greek culture flourished during this periodcity-states maintained a level of political autonomy, and Roman society adopted many aspects of Greek culture. For example, Roman poets like Ovid, Virgil, and Horace retold and adopted many Greek myths of old, folding them into Roman culture. Roman society even claimed to share a cultural lineage with Greece, as exemplified by Virgil&#x27;s epic, the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, which details their founding myth of how the Roman people descended from the Trojan Aeneas of Homeric lore.

Although the period of Roman rule in Greece is conventionally dated as starting from the sacking of Corinth by the Roman Lucius Mummius in 146 BC, Macedonia had already come under Roman control with the defeat of its king, Perseus, by the Roman Aemilius Paullus at Pydna in 168 BC.

The Romans divided the region into four smaller republics, and in 146 BC Macedonia officially became a province, with its capital at Thessalonica. The rest of the Greek city-states eventually paid homage to Rome, ending their &quot;de jure&quot; autonomy as well. The Romans left local administration to the Greeks without making any attempt to abolish traditional political patterns. The agora in Athens continued to be the center of civic and political life.

Emperor Caracalla&#x27;s decree in 212 AD, the &quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot;, extended citizenship outside Italy to all free adult men in the entire Roman Empire, effectively raising provincial populations to equal status with the city of Rome itself. The importance of this decree is historical, not political. It set the basis for integration, where the economic and judicial mechanisms of the state could be applied throughout the Mediterranean as was once done from Latium into all Italy. In practice, integration did not take place uniformly. Societies already integrated with Rome, such as Greece, were favored by the decree, as opposed to the further away, poorer, or more culturally different provinces like Britain, Palestine, or Egypt.

Caracalla&#x27;s decree did not set in motion the processes that led to the transfer of power from Italy and the West to Greece and the East, but rather accelerated them, setting the foundations for the millennium-long rise of Greece, in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire, as a major power in Europe and the Mediterranean in the Middle Ages.

==Middle Ages==
===Byzantine rule (324–1204)===


The division of the Roman Empire into East and West and the subsequent collapse of the Western one accentuated the position of Greece in the empire and eventually brought it into the imperial center of power. Constantinople (now modern-day Istanbul) became the central city of the empire when Constantine the Great declared Byzantium the new capital of the Roman Empire, renaming the city in his honor. This political change signified the broader eastward migration of Hellenism toward Anatolia, and it nominally placed the city as the center of Hellenic culture, a beacon for Greeks that lasted into the modern era.

The East Roman Empire, now also known as the Byzantine Empire, was dominated politically by Emperors Constantine the Great and Justinian from 324 to 610. Assimilating the Roman tradition, the emperors sought to build the foundation for later developments and formation of the Empire. The early centuries of the Empire were marked by efforts to secure its borders and restore the Roman territories, as well as the formation and establishment of the Orthodox Church and several of religious schisms following it.

In the first period of the middle Byzantine era (610–867), the empire was attacked both by old enemies (Persians, Lombards, Avars, and Slavs) as well as by new ones (Arabs, Bulgars). The main characteristic of this period was instability, as enemy attacks tended to extend deep into the Empire&#x27;s interior, even threatening the capital itself.

The attacks of the Slavs became less frequent as the Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe ended and permanent Slavic settlements and states began to form. Initially hostile to Constantinople until their Christianization, the Byzantines referred to these tribes and states as &quot;Sclavinias&quot;.

Changes also occurred in the internal structure of the empire, due to both external and internal conditions. The predominance of small free farmers, the expansion of military estates, and the development of the system of themes brought to completion the developments started by early Byzantine Emperors. Cultural and religious changes occurred as well. Byzantine administration and society became inseparably Greek. Additionally, the restoration of Orthodoxy after the iconoclast movements (726787 and 814842) allowed the successful resumption of missionary action among neighboring peoples and their placement within the sphere of Byzantine cultural influence. During this period, the Empire was geographically reduced and economically damaged since it lost wealth-producing regions. However, it obtained greater lingual, dogmatic, and cultural homogeneity.

From the late 8th century, the Empire began to recover from the devastating impact of successive invasions, and the reconquest of the Greek peninsula began. Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor were brought in as settlers. Slavs were either driven out to Asia Minor or assimilated, and the &quot;Sclavinias&quot; were forcibly eradicated. By the middle of the 9th century, the Greek peninsula was under Byzantine control again, and its cities began to recover due to improved security and the restoration of effective central control.

===Economic prosperity===
After the Byzantine Empire was rescued from a period of crisis through the resolute leadership of the three Komnenoi emperors Alexios, John, and Manuel in the 12th century, Greece prospered. Recent research has revealed that this period was a time of significant growth in the rural economy, with rising population levels and extensive tracts of new agricultural land being brought into production. The widespread construction of new rural churches around this time is a strong indication that prosperity was being generated even in remote areas.

A steady increase in population led to a higher population density, and there is good evidence that the demographic increase was accompanied by the revival of towns. According to Alan Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire 900–1200&quot;, towns expanded significantly in the twelfth century. Archaeological evidence shows an increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a &quot;notable upsurge&quot; in new towns. It also indicates that many medieval towns, including Athens, Thessaloniki, Thebes, and Corinth, experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century.

The growth of the towns attracted trade with the Venetian Republic in nearby Italy, and this interest in trade appears to have further increased economic prosperity in Greece. The Venetians and others were active traders in the ports of the Holy Land, and they made a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of Outremer and the West while also trading extensively with Byzantium and Egypt.

===Artistic revival===

A renaissance of Byzantine art began in the 10th century. Many of the most important Byzantine churches in and around Athens, for example, were built around this time. This artistic revival reflects the urbanization of Greece during this period. There was also a revival in mosaic art, with artists showing great interest in depicting natural landscapes with wild animals and scenes from the hunt. Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. With its love of luxury and passion for color, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the Christian world.

Beautiful silks from the workshops of Constantinople portrayed animals in dazzling color, such as lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins confronting each other, or Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase. The eyes of many patrons were attracted and the economy of Greece grew. In the provinces, regional schools of architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences. All this suggests that there was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work.

Yet the marvelous expansion of Byzantine art during this period, one of the most remarkable facts in the history of the empire, did not stop there. From the 10th to the 12th century, Byzantium was the main source of artistic inspiration for the West. For example, the mosaics of St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica the Torcello Cathedral in Venice clearly show Byzantine influence in their style, arrangement, and iconography. Similarly in Sicily, the mosaics of the Palatine Chapel, Martorana, and Monreale Cathedral in Palermo, as well as the Cefalù Cathedral, show the influence of Byzantine art on Norman Sicily in the 12th century.

Andalusian art in Western Europe was also influenced by Byzantium. Romanesque art, too, contains many Byzantine elements, including its decorative forms and the plans of some of its buildings (e.g., the domed churches of south-western France). Princes of Kiev, Venetian Doges, abbots of Monte Cassino, merchants of Amalfi, and the Norman kings of Sicily all drew from Byzantine culture in their art.

===The Fourth Crusade (1204)===

The year 1204 marks the beginning of the Late Byzantine period, when Constantinople and a number of Byzantine territories were conquered by the Latins during the Fourth Crusade. During this period, a number of Byzantine Greek successor states emerged. The Empire of Nicaea, the Despotate of Epirus, and the Empire of Trebizond each claimed to be the legitimate successor of the Byzantine Empire. Meanwhile, the Latin and Frank Crusaders founded the Catholic Latin Empire, known to the Byzantines as &quot;Frankokratia&quot; or &quot;Latinokratia&quot;, with Constantinople as its capital. Among its vassal states were the Principality of Achaea, the Duchy of Athens, the Duchy of the Archipelago, and the Kingdom of Thessalonica. Under the Latin Empire, elements of feudalism entered medieval Greek life.

===From partial Byzantine restoration to 1453===
The Latin Empire, lasted only 57 years, and in 1261 Constantinople was reclaimed by the Nicaean Empire and the Byzantine Empire was restored. However, in mainland Greece and the Greek islands, various Latin and Venetian possessions continued to exist. From 1261 onwards, Byzantium underwent a gradual weakening of its internal structures and the reduction of its territories from Ottoman invasions, culminating in the fall of Constantinople on May 29, 1453. The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople resulted in the official end of both the Eastern Roman Empire and the Byzantine period of Greek history.

==Venetian and Ottoman rule (15th century – 1821)==
The Greeks held out in the Peloponnese until 1460, and the Venetians and Genoese clung to some of the islands, but by the early 16th century all of mainland Greece and most of the Aegean Islands were conquered by the Ottoman Empire, excluding several port cities still held by the Venetians (Nafplio, Monemvasia, Parga and Methone the most important of them). The Cyclades, in the middle of the Aegean Sea, were officially annexed by the Ottomans in 1579, although they were under vassal status since the 1530s. Cyprus fell in 1571, and the Venetians retained Crete until 1669. The Ionian Islands were never ruled by the Ottomans, with the exception of Kefalonia (from 1479 to 1481 and from 1485 to 1500), and they remained under the rule of the Republic of Venice. It was in the Ionian Islands where modern Greek statehood was born, with the creation of the Republic of the Seven Islands in 1800.

When the Ottomans arrived, two Greek migrations occurred. In the first, the Greek intelligentsia migrated to Western Europe, influencing the advent of the European Renaissance. In the second, Greeks left the plains of the Greek peninsula and resettled in the mountains.

Ottoman Greece was a multiethnic society, but in a way very different from the modern Western notion of multiculturalism. The Greeks were given some privileges and freedom by the Empire, but they were exposed to tyranny deriving from malpractices of regional administrative personnel, over which the central government had only remote and incomplete control. The Ottoman millet system contributed to the ethnic cohesion of Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the Ottoman Empire based on religion. Greeks living in the plains during Ottoman rule were either Christians or crypto-Christians, Greek &quot;Muslims&quot; who were secret practitioners of the Greek Orthodox faith. Some Greeks became crypto-Christians to avoid heavy taxes while retaining their religious identity and ties to the Greek Orthodox Church. Greeks who converted to Islam and were not crypto-Christians were deemed &quot;Turks&quot; in the eyes of Orthodox Greeks even if they did not adopt the Turkish language, evidence of the ethnic and religious tensions in Greece under Ottoman rule.

The Ottomans ruled most of Greece until the early 19th century. The first self-governed Hellenic state since the Middle Ages was established on the Ionian islands during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1800, 21 years before the outbreak of the Greek revolution in mainland Greece. It was called the Septinsular Republic (Greek: ), or Republic of the Seven United Islands, and it used Corfu as its capital.

==Modern Greek nation state (1821 – present)==


In the early months of 1821, the Greeks declared their independence, but did not achieve it until 1829. The Great Powers first shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the &quot;status quo&quot; of the Ottoman Empire, but soon changed their stance. Scores of non-Greeks philhellenes volunteered to fight for the cause, including Lord Byron.

On October 20, 1827, a combined British, French and Russian naval force destroyed the Ottoman and Egyptian armada. The Russian minister of foreign affairs, Ioannis Kapodistrias, himself a Septinsular Greek, returned home as Governor of the First Republic and with his diplomatic handling, managed to secure the Greek independence and the military dominination in Central Greece. The first capital of the independent Greece was temporarily Aigina (1828–1829) and later officially Nafplion (1828–1834). After his assassination, the European powers turned Greece into a monarchy; the first King, Otto, came from Bavaria and the second, George I, from Denmark. In 1834, King Otto transferred the capital to Athens.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Greece sought to enlarge its boundaries to include the ethnic Greek population of the Ottoman Empire. Greece played a peripheral role in the Crimean War. When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, Greek leaders saw an opportunity to expand North and South into Ottoman areas that had a Christian majority. However, Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support. The French and British seized its major port and effectively neutralized the Greek army. Greek efforts to cause insurrections failed as they were easily crushed by Ottoman forces. Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war. The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was later forced to abdicate. The Ionian Islands were given by Britain upon the arrival of the new King George I in 1863 and Thessaly was ceded by the Ottomans in 1880.

===Modernization===
In the late 19th century, modernization transformed the social structure of Greece. The population grew rapidly, putting heavy pressure on the system of small farms with low productivity. Overall, population density more than doubled from 41 persons per square mile in 1829 to 114 in 1912 (16 to 44 per km2). One response was emigration to the United States, with a quarter million people leaving between 1906 and 1914. Entrepreneurs found numerous business opportunities in the retail and restaurant sectors of American cities; some sent money back to their families, others returned with hundreds of dollars, enough to purchase a farm or a small business in the old village. The urban population tripled from 8% in 1853 to 24% in 1907. Athens grew from a village of 6000 people in 1834, when it became the capital, to 63,000 in 1879, 111,000 in 1896, and 167,000 in 1907.

In Athens and other cities, men arriving from rural areas set up workshops and stores, creating a middle class. They joined with bankers, professional men, university students, and military officers, to demand reform and modernization of the political and economic system. Athens became the center of the merchant marine, which quadrupled from 250,000 tons in 1875 to more than 1,000,000 tons in 1915. As the cities modernized, businessmen adopted the latest styles of Western European architecture.

===Balkan Wars===

The participation of Greece in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 is one of the most important episodes in modern Greek history, as it allowed the Greek state to almost double its size and achieve most of its present territorial size. As a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, most of Epirus, Macedonia, Crete and the northern Aegean islands were incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece.

===World War I and Greco-Turkish War===

The outbreak of World War I in 1914 produced a split in Greek politics, with King Constantine I, an admirer of Germany, calling for neutrality while Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos pushed for Greece to join the Allies. The conflict between the monarchists and the Venizelists sometimes resulted in open warfare and became known as the National Schism. In 1917, the Allies forced Constantine to abdicate in favor of his son Alexander and Venizelos returned as premier. At the end of the war, the Great Powers agreed that the Ottoman city of Smyrna (İzmir) and its hinterland, both of which had large Greek populations, be handed over to Greece.

Greek troops occupied Smyrna in 1919, and in 1920 the Treaty of Sèvres was signed by the Ottoman government; the treaty stipulated that in five years time a plebiscite would be held in Smyrna on whether the region would join Greece. However, Turkish nationalists, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, overthrew the Ottoman government and organised a military campaign against the Greek troops, resulting in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). A major Greek offensive ground to a halt in 1921, and by 1922 Greek troops were in retreat. The Turkish forces recaptured Smyrna on 9 September 1922, and then a fire broke out in the city. It is debatable who is responsible for the fire. The fire resulted in the deaths of Armenians and Greeks in Smyrna.

The war was concluded by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), according to which there was to be a population exchange between Greece and Turkey on the basis of religion. Over one million Orthodox Christians left Turkey in exchange for 400,000 Muslims from Greece. The events of 1919–1922 are regarded in Greece as a particularly calamitous period of history. Between 1914 and 1923, an estimated 750,000 to 900,000 Greeks died at the hands of the Ottoman Turks, in what many scholars have termed a genocide.

===Interwar to World War II===



The Second Hellenic Republic was proclaimed in 1924 only to be disestablished in 1935 with the return of King George II of Greece. In August 1936, Prime Minister Metaxas, with the agreement of the king, suspended the parliament and established the quasi-fascist Metaxas regime.

Despite the country&#x27;s numerically small and ill-equipped armed forces, Greece made a decisive contribution to the Allied efforts in World War II. At the start of the war, Greece sided with the Allies and refused to give in to Italian demands. Italy invaded Greece by way of Albania on 28 October 1940, but Greek troops repelled the invaders after a bitter struggle (see Greco-Italian War). This marked the first Allied victory in the war.

Primarily to secure his strategic southern flank, German dictator Adolf Hitler reluctantly stepped in and launched the Battle of Greece in April 1941. Axis units from Germany, Bulgaria, and Italy successfully invaded Greece, through Yugoslavia, forcing out the Greek defenders. The Greek government eventually decided to stop the fighting and thus stopped sending ammunition and supplies to the northern front and the defenders were easily overrun. The Greek government then proceeded, as the Nazi forces came towards the capital of Athens, to leave for Crete and then Cairo, Egypt.

On 20 May 1941, the Germans attempted to seize Crete with a large attack by paratroopers, with the aim of reducing the threat of a counter-offensive by Allied forces in Egypt, but faced heavy resistance. The Greek campaign might have delayed German military plans against the Soviet Union, and it is argued that had the German invasion of the Soviet Union started on 20 May 1941 instead of 22 June 1941, the Nazi assault against the Soviet Union might have succeeded. The heavy losses of German paratroopers led the Germans to launch no further large-scale air-invasions.

During the Axis occupation of Greece, thousands of Greeks died in direct combat, in concentration camps, or of starvation. The occupiers murdered the greater part of the Jewish community despite efforts by Christian Greeks to shelter the Jews. The economy was devastated, and the currency suffered one of the worst hyperinflations ever recorded.

When the Soviet Army began its drive across Romania in August 1944, the German Army in Greece began withdrawing north and northwestward from Greece into Yugoslavia and Albania to avoid being cut off in Greece. Hence, the German occupation of Greece ended in October 1944. The Resistance group ELAS seized control of Athens on 12 October 1944. British troops had already landed on 4 October in Patras, and entered Athens on 14 October 1944.

Christina Goulter summarizes the devastation done to Greece during the war:

:&quot;Between 1941 and 1945, over 8% of the Greek population had died; some 2000 villages and small towns had been razed to the ground; starvation was widespread due to the destruction of crops and worsened in many parts of Greece after liberation when agricultural labourers migrated to urban centres to escape politically inspired violence in the countryside; trade either internally or externally had all but ceased; most of Greece&#x27;s merchant marine lay at the bottom of the sea; and motorized transport had been confiscated by the axis occupiers.&quot;

===Greek Civil War (1944–1949)===

The Greek Civil War () was the first major confrontation of the Cold War. It was fought between 1944 and 1949 in Greece between the nationalist/non-Marxist forces of Greece (financially supported by the United Kingdom at first, and later by the United States) and the Democratic Army of Greece (ELAS), which was the military branch of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE).

The conflict resulted in a victory for the British — and later U.S.-supported government forces, which led to Greece receiving American funds through the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, as well as becoming a member of NATO, which helped to define the ideological balance of power in the Aegean for the entire Cold War.

The first phase of the civil war occurred in 1943–1944. Marxist and non-Marxist resistance groups fought each other in a fratricidal conflict to establish the leadership of the Greek resistance movement. In the second phase (December 1944), the ascendant communists, in military control of most of Greece, confronted the returning Greek government in exile, which had been formed under the auspices of the Western Allies in Cairo and originally included six KKE-affiliated ministers. In the third phase (called by some the &quot;Third Round&quot;), guerrilla forces controlled by the KKE fought against the internationally recognized Greek government which was formed after elections were boycotted by the KKE. Although the involvement of the KKE in the uprisings was universally known, the party remained legal until 1948, continuing to coordinate attacks from its Athens offices until proscription.

The war, which lasted from 1946 to 1949, was characterised by guerilla warfare between the KKE forces and Greek governmental forces mainly in the mountain ranges of northern Greece. The war ended with the NATO bombing of Mount Grammos and the final defeat of the KKE forces. The civil war left Greece with a legacy of political polarization. As a result, Greece also entered into an alliance with the United States and joined NATO, while relationships with its communist northern neighbours, both pro-Soviet and neutral, became strained.

=== Postwar development and integration in Western Bloc (1949–1967) ===
In the 1950s and 1960s, Greece developed rapidly, initially with the help of the Marshall Plan&#x27;s grants and loans, also to decrease the communist influence. In 1952, by joining NATO, Greece clearly became part of the Western Bloc of the Cold War. But in Greek society, the deep divide between the leftist and rightist sections continued.

The Greek economy advanced further through growth in the tourism sector. New attention was given to women&#x27;s rights, and in 1952 suffrage for women was guaranteed in the Constitution, full Constitutional equality following, and Lina Tsaldari becoming the first female minister that decade.

The Greek economic miracle is the period of sustained economic growth, generally from 1950 to 1973. During this period, the Greek economy grew by an average of 7.7%, second in the world only to Japan.

=== Military dictatorship (1967–1974) ===

In 1967, the Greek military seized power in a coup d&#x27;état, overthrowing the centre right government of Panagiotis Kanellopoulos. It established the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 which became known as the &quot;Régime of the Colonels&quot;. The junta government&#x27;s accession to power led to an isolation of Greece from European affairs and froze Greece&#x27;s entry to the European Union. In 1973, the régime abolished the Greek monarchy and in 1974, dictator Papadopoulos denied help to the United States. After a second coup that year, Colonel Ioannides was appointed as the new head-of-state.

Ioannides was responsible for the 1974 coup against President Makarios of Cyprus. The coup became the pretext for the first wave of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 (see Greco-Turkish relations). The Cyprus events and the outcry following a bloody suppression of Athens Polytechnic uprising in Athens led to the implosion of the military régime.

=== Third Hellenic Republic (1974 – present) ===
After the end of the military régime, democracy was restored.

The fall of the junta was followed by the metapolitefsi. Metapolitefsi was initiated when Konstantinos Karamanlis returned from self-exile in Paris at the invitation of the junta, to become interim prime minister on July 23, 1974. and later gained re-election for two further terms at the head of the conservative New Democracy Party. In August 1974, Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of NATO in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.

In 1974, a referendum voted 69%–31% to confirm the deposition of King Constantine II. A democratic republican constitution came into force. Another previously exiled politician, Andreas Papandreou also returned and founded the socialist PASOK Party (Panhellenic Socialist Movement), which won the 1981 election and dominated Greek politics for almost two decades.

After the restoration of democracy, Greece&#x27;s stability and economic prosperity improved significantly. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980, joined the European Union (EU) in 1981 and adopted the euro as its currency in 2001. New infrastructure funds from the EU and growing revenues from tourism, shipping, services, light industry and the telecommunications industry have brought Greeks an unprecedented standard of living. Tensions continue to exist between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus and the delimitation of borders in the Aegean Sea but relations have considerably thawed following successive earthquakes, first in Turkey and then in Greece, and an outpouring of sympathy and generous assistance by ordinary Greeks and Turks (see Earthquake Diplomacy).

===Greece in the Eurozone===
The 2008 global economic recession impacted Greece, as well as the rest of the countries in the eurozone. From late 2009, fears developed in investment markets of a sovereign debt crisis concerning Greece&#x27;s ability to pay its debts, in view of the large increase in the country&#x27;s government debt. This crisis of confidence was indicated by a widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on credit default swaps compared to other countries, most importantly Germany. Downgrading of Greek government debt to junk bond status created alarm in financial markets. On 2 May 2010, the Eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund agreed on a loan for Greece, conditional on the implementation of harsh austerity measures.

In October 2011, Eurozone leaders also agreed on a proposal to write off 50% of Greek debt owed to private creditors, increasing the European Financial Stability Facility amount to about €1 trillion, and requiring European banks to achieve 9% capitalization to reduce the risk of contagion to other countries. These austerity measures were extremely unpopular with the Greek public, precipitating demonstrations and civil unrest. This period corresponds to Greek government-debt crisis, that changed dramatically the political stage. Early in the period, PASOK were able to capitalise on a loss of support for ND. However, by the early 2010s, PASOK were also attracting blame for their handling of the crisis, and the radical party SYRIZA became the largest party on the left. The position of the far-right was also strengthened in this period.

SYRIZA has since overtaken PASOK as the main party of the centre-left.Alexis Tsipras led SYRIZA to victory in the general election held on 25 January 2015, falling short of an outright majority in Parliament by just two seats. The following morning, Tsipras reached an agreement with Independent Greeks party to form a coalition, and he was sworn in as Prime Minister of Greece. Tsipras called snap elections in August 2015, resigning from his post, which led to a month-long caretaker administration headed by judge Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou, Greece&#x27;s first female prime minister. In the September 2015 general election, Alexis Tsipras led SYRIZA to another victory, winning 145 out of 300 seats and re-forming the coalition with the Independent Greeks. However, he was defeated in the July 2019 general election by Kyriakos Mitsotakis who leads New Democracy. On 7 July 2019, Kyriakos Mitsotakis was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Greece. He formed a centre-right government after the landslide victory of his New Democracy party.

In March 2020, Greece&#x27;s parliament elected a non-partisan candidate, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, as the first female President of Greece. In June 2023, conservative New Democracy party won the legislative election, meaning another four-year term as prime minister for Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

In 2024, the Greek economy is forecast to grow nearly 3%, meaning it approaches its pre-crisis size of 2009 and far outpacing the euro zone average economic growth of 0.8%. On 31 August 2024, Greece declared a state of emergency in Volos after more than 100 metric tons of dead fish were recovered from the port of Volos.

<text>The Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, commonly shortened to the Eisner Awards, are awards for creative achievement in American comic books. They are regarded as the most prestigious and significant awards in the comic industry and often referred to as the industry&#x27;s equivalent of the Academy Awards. 

The first Eisners were conferred in 1988, for works published in 1987. The Eisner Awards ceremony has been held at San Diego Comic-Con every year since 1991. The awards are named in honor of pioneering cartoonist and writer Will Eisner, who was a regular participant in the ceremony until his death in 2005.

The nominations in each category are generated by a five- to six-member jury, then voted on by comic book professionals. The jury often consists of at least one comics retailer, one librarian (since 2005), and one academic researcher, among other comic experts. , awards are presented in 32 categories.

== History ==
The Eisner Awards and Harvey Awards were first conferred in 1988, both created in response to the discontinuation of the Kirby Awards in 1987. Dave Olbrich started the non-profit organization.

There was no Eisner Awards ceremony, or awards distributed, in 1990, due to widespread balloting mix-ups. The previous administrator, Dave Olbrich, left the position, and Jackie Estrada has been the award administrator since 1990. The Eisner Awards ceremony has been held at San Diego Comic-Con every year since 1991.

In 2006, it was announced that the archives of the Eisner Awards would be housed at the James Branch Cabell Library of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia.

==Categories==
The Eisner Awards are awarded in the following categories:

<text>Mycenaean Greece (or the Mycenaean civilization) was the last phase of the Bronze Age in ancient Greece, spanning the period from approximately 1750 to 1050 BC. It represents the first advanced and distinctively Greek civilization in mainland Greece with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art, and writing system. The Mycenaeans were mainland Greek peoples who were likely stimulated by their contact with insular Minoan Crete and other Mediterranean cultures to develop a more sophisticated sociopolitical culture of their own. The most prominent site was Mycenae, after which the culture of this era is named. Other centers of power that emerged included Pylos, Tiryns, and Midea in the Peloponnese, Orchomenos, Thebes, and Athens in Central Greece, and Iolcos in Thessaly. Mycenaean settlements also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, on islands in the Aegean Sea, on the south-west coast of Asia Minor, and on Cyprus, while Mycenaean-influenced settlements appeared in the Levant and Italy.

The Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language, and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic pantheon. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace-centered states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social, and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as a &quot;wanax&quot;.

Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the Greek Dark Ages, a recordless transitional period leading to Archaic Greece where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to decentralized forms of socio-economic organization (including the extensive use of iron). Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the Dorian invasion or activities connected to the &quot;Sea Peoples&quot;. Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have also been suggested. The Mycenaean period became the historical setting of much ancient Greek literature and mythology, including the Trojan Epic Cycle.

==Chronology==

The Bronze Age in mainland Greece is generally termed as the &quot;Helladic period&quot; by modern archaeologists, after , the Greek name for Greece. This period is divided into three subperiods: The Early Helladic (EH) period (–2000 BC) was a time of prosperity with the use of metals and a growth in technology, economy and social organization. The Middle Helladic (MH) period (–1700/1675 BC) faced a slower pace of development, as well as the evolution of megaron-type dwellings and cist grave burials. The last phase of Middle Helladic, the Middle Helladic III (–1675 BC), along with the Late Helladic (LH) period (/1675–1050 BC) roughly coincide with Mycenaean Greece.

The Late Helladic period is further divided into LHI and LHII, both of which coincide with the middle phase of Mycenaean Greece (/1675–1420 BC), and LHIII (–1050 BC), the period of expansion, and decline of the Mycenaean civilization. The transition period from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in Greece is known as Sub-Mycenaean (–1000 BC).

Based on recent research, Alex Knodell (2021) considers the beginning of Mycenaean occupation in Peloponnese in Middle Helladic III (–1675 BC), and divides the whole Mycenaean time into three cultural periods: Early Mycenaean (–1400 BC), Palatial Bronze Age (–1200 BC), and Postpalatial Bronze Age (–1050 BC).



==Identity==

The decipherment of the Mycenaean Linear B script, a writing system adapted for the use of the (Indo-European) Greek language of the Late Bronze Age, demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new Phoenician-derived alphabetic script emerged. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period. Lastly, the decipherment marked the advent of an Indo-European language in the Aegean region in contrast to unrelated prior languages spoken in adjoining areas. Various collective terms for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th-century BC epic the &quot;Iliad&quot; in reference to the Trojan War.

Homer interchangeably used the ethnonyms &quot;Achaeans&quot;, &quot;Danaans&quot;, and &quot;Argives&quot; to refer to the besiegers, and these names appear to have passed down from the time they were in use to the time when Homer applied them as collective terms in his &quot;Iliad&quot;. There is an isolated reference to &quot;a-ka-wi-ja-de&quot; in the Linear B records in Knossos, Crete dated to , which presumably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.

Egyptian records mention a &quot;T(D)-n-j&quot; or &quot;Danaya&quot; (&quot;Tanaju&quot;) land for the first time , during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmoses III (r. 1479–1425 BC). This land is geographically defined in an inscription from the reign of Amenhotep III (r. –1352 BC), where a number of Danaya cities are mentioned, which cover the largest part of southern mainland Greece. Among them, cities such as Mycenae, Nauplion, and Thebes have been identified with certainty. Danaya has been equated with the ethnonym &quot;Danaoi&quot; (), the name of the mythical dynasty that ruled in the region of Argos, also used as an ethnonym for the Greek people by Homer.

In the official records of another Bronze Age empire, that of the Hittites in Anatolia, various references from to 1220 BC mention a country named &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot;. Recent scholarship, based on textual evidence, new interpretations of the Hittite inscriptions, and recent surveys of archaeological evidence about Mycenaean–Anatolian contacts during this period, concludes that the term &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot; must have been used in reference to the Mycenaean world (land of the Achaeans), or at least to a part of it. This term may have also had broader connotations in some texts, possibly referring to all regions settled by Mycenaeans or regions under direct Mycenaean political control. Another similar ethnonym, &quot;Ekwesh,&quot; in twelfth century BC Egyptian inscriptions has been commonly identified with the Ahhiyawans. These Ekwesh were mentioned as a group of the Sea People.

==History==

===Early Mycenaean period and Shaft Grave era (c. 1750–1400 BC)===
Scholars have proposed different theories on the origins of the Mycenaeans. According to one theory, Mycenaean civilization reflected the exogenous imposition of archaic Indo-Europeans from the Eurasian steppe onto the pre-Mycenaean local population. An issue with this theory, however, is the very tenuous material and cultural relationship between Aegean and northern steppe populations during the Bronze Age. Another theory proposes that Mycenaean culture in Greece dates back to circa 3000 BC with Indo-European migrants entering a mainly-depopulated area; other hypotheses argue for a date as early as the seventh millennium BC (with the spread of agriculture) and as late as 1600 BC (with the spread of chariot technology). In a 2017 genetic study conducted by Lazaridis et al., &quot;the Minoans and Mycenaeans were genetically similar, [but] the Mycenaeans differed from Minoans in deriving additional ancestry from an ultimate source related to the hunter–gatherers of eastern Europe and Siberia, introduced via a proximal source related to the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia.&quot; However, Lazaridis et al. admit that their research &quot;does not settle th[e] debate&quot; on Mycenaean origins. Historian Bernard Sergent notes that archaeology alone is not able to solve the issue and that the majority of Hellenists believed Mycenaeans spoke a non-Indo-European Minoan language before Linear B was deciphered in 1952.

Notwithstanding the above academic disputes, the mainstream consensus among modern Mycenologists is that Mycenaean civilization began around 1750 BC, earlier than the Shaft Graves, originating and evolving from the local socio-cultural landscape of the Early and Middle Bronze Age in mainland Greece with influences from Minoan Crete. Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (/1675 BC), a significant increase in the population and the number of settlements occurred. A number of centers of power emerged in southern mainland Greece dominated by a warrior elite society; while the typical dwellings of that era were an early type of megaron buildings, some more complex structures are classified as forerunners of the later palaces. In a number of sites, defensive walls were also erected.

Meanwhile, new types of burials and more imposing ones have been unearthed, which display a great variety of luxurious objects. Among the various burial types, the shaft grave became the most common form of elite burial, a feature that gave the name to the early period of Mycenaean Greece. Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid to rest in gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments. The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles A and B, signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.

During this period, the Mycenaean centers witnessed increased contact with the outside world, especially with the Cyclades and the Minoan centers on the island of Crete. Mycenaean presence appears to be also depicted in a fresco at Akrotiri, on Thera island, which possibly displays many warriors in boar&#x27;s tusk helmets, a feature typical of Mycenaean warfare. In the early 15th century BC, commerce intensified with Mycenaean pottery reaching the western coast of Asia Minor, including Miletus and Troy, Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt.

Early Mycenaean civilization from the Shaft Grave period generally showcases heavy influence from Minoan Crete in regards to e.g. art, infrastructure and symbols, while also maintaining some Helladic elements as well as some innovations, and some West Asian influences. A difference between Mycenaean and Minoan civilizations is complexity and monumentality; Mycenaean craftmanship and architecture are more simplified versions of Minoan ones, but are more monumental in size. Later phases of the Mycenaean civilization showcase more sophistication, eventually coming to surpass Minoan Crete after a few centuries.

At the end of the Shaft Grave era, a new and more imposing type of elite burial emerged, the tholos: large circular burial chambers with high vaulted roofs and a straight entry passage lined with stone.

===Koine era or Palatial Bronze Age (c. 1400–1200 BC)===

Starting in the 15th century BC, the Mycenaeans began to spread their influence throughout the Aegean and Western Anatolia. By , the palace of Knossos was ruled by a Mycenaean elite who formed a hybrid Minoan-Mycenaean culture. Mycenaeans also colonized several other Aegean islands, reaching as far as Rhodes. Thus the Mycenaeans became the dominant power of the region, marking the beginning of the Mycenaean &#x27;Koine&#x27; era (from , common), a highly uniform culture that spread in mainland Greece and the Aegean.

From the early 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade began to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities in the Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse. The trade routes were expanded further, reaching Cyprus, Amman in the Near East, Apulia in Italy and Spain. From that time period (), the palace of Knossos has yielded the earliest records of the Greek Linear B script, based on the previous Linear A of the Minoans. The use of the new script spread in mainland Greece and offers valuable insight into the administrative network of the palatial centers. However, the unearthed records are too fragmentary for a political reconstruction of Bronze Age Greece.

Excavations at Miletus, southwest Asia Minor, indicate the existence of a Mycenaean settlement there already from , replacing the previous Minoan installations. This site became a sizable and prosperous Mycenaean center until the 12th century BC. Apart from the archaeological evidence, this is also attested in Hittite records, which indicate that Miletos (Milawata in Hittite) was the most important base for Mycenaean activity in Asia Minor. Mycenaean presence also reached the adjacent sites of Iasus and Ephesus.

Meanwhile, imposing palaces were built in the main Mycenaean centers of the mainland. The earliest palace structures were megaron-type buildings, such as the Menelaion in Sparta, Lakonia. Palaces proper are datable from , when Cyclopean fortifications were erected at Mycenae and nearby Tiryns. Additional palaces were built in Midea and Pylos in Peloponnese, Athens, Eleusis, Thebes and Orchomenos in Central Greece and Iolcos, in Thessaly, the latter being the northernmost Mycenaean center. Knossos in Crete also became a Mycenaean center, where the former Minoan complex underwent a number of adjustments, including the addition of a throne room. These centers were based on a rigid network of bureaucracy where administrative competencies were classified into various sections and offices according to specialization of work and trades. At the head of this society was the king, known as &quot;wanax&quot; (Linear B: wa-na-ka) in Mycenaean Greek. All powers were vested in him, as the main landlord and spiritual and military leader. At the same time he was an entrepreneur and trader and was aided by a network of high officials.

====Involvement in Asia Minor====
The presence of &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot; in western Anatolia is mentioned in various Hittite accounts from to . &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot; is generally accepted as a Hittite term for Mycenaean Greece (&quot;Achaeans&quot; in Homeric Greek), but a precise geographical definition of the term cannot be drawn from the texts. During this time, the kings of Ahhiyawa were evidently capable of dealing with their Hittite counterparts both on a diplomatic and military level. Moreover, Ahhiyawa achieved considerable political influence in parts of Western Anatolia, typically by encouraging anti-Hittite uprisings and collaborating with local vassal rulers.

In , Hittite records mention the military activities of an Ahhiyawan warlord, Attarsiya, possibly related to the mythic character of Atreus. Attarsiya attacked Hittite vassals in western Anatolia including Madduwatta. Later, in c. 1315 BC, an anti-Hittite rebellion headed by Arzawa, a Hittite vassal state, received support from Ahhiyawa. Meanwhile, Ahhiyawa appears to be in control of a number of islands in the Aegean, an impression also supported by archaeological evidence. During the reign of the Hittite king Hattusili III (c. 1267–1237 BC), the king of Ahhiyawa is recognized as a &quot;Great King&quot; and of equal status with the other contemporary great Bronze Age rulers: the kings of Egypt, Babylonia and Assyria. At that time, another anti-Hittite movement, led by Piyama-Radu, broke out and was supported by the king of Ahhiyawa. Piyama-Radu caused major unrest which may have extended to the region of Wilusa, and later invaded the island of Lesbos, which then passed into Ahhiyawan control.

Scholars have speculated that the mythic tradition of the Trojan War could have a historical basis in the political turmoil of this era. As a result of this instability, the Hittite king initiated correspondence in order to convince his Ahhiyawan counterpart to restore peace in the region. The Hittite record mentions a certain Tawagalawa, a possible Hittite rendering of the Greek name Eteocles, as brother of the king of Ahhiyawa.

===Collapse or Postpalatial Bronze Age (c. 1200–1050 BC)===

====Initial decline and revival====

In 1250 BC, the first wave of destruction apparently occurred in various centres of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. In Boeotia, Thebes was burned to the ground, around that year or slightly later. Nearby Orchomenos was not destroyed at this time but was abandoned, while the Boeotian fortifications of Gla displays evidence for a targeted destruction as only the four gates and the monumental building, called the Melathron, were burned before the site was abandoned. In the Peloponnese, a number of buildings surrounding the citadel of Mycenae were attacked and burned.

These incidents appear to have prompted the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Tiryns, Midea and Athens expanded their defences with new cyclopean-style walls. The extension program in Mycenae almost doubled the fortified area of the citadel. To this phase of extension belongs the impressive Lion Gate, the main entrance into the Mycenaean acropolis.

It appears that after this first wave of destruction a short-lived revival of Mycenaean culture followed. Mycenaean Greece continues to be mentioned in international affairs, particularly in Hittite records. In , the king of Ahhiyawa is again reported to have been involved in an anti-Hittite uprising in western Anatolia. Another contemporary Hittite account reports that Ahhiyawan ships should avoid Assyrian-controlled harbors, as part of a trade embargo imposed on Assyria. In general, in the second half of 13th century BC, trade was in decline in the Eastern Mediterranean, most probably due to the unstable political environment there.

====Final collapse and differing trajectories====
None of the defence measures appear to have prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in c. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event marked the end of Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. A recent study suggests that neither of the palaces at Tiryns or Midea were destroyed by an earthquake, and further studies have shown that upwards of fifty arrowheads were found scattered in the destruction debris at Midea perhaps indicating that the destruction was caused by an assault. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, was destroyed in c. 1180 BC. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.

As a result of this turmoil, specific regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia. Mycenaean refugees migrated to Cyprus and the Levantine coast. Nevertheless, other regions on the edge of the Mycenaean world prospered, such as the Ionian islands, the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of Attica and a number of Aegean islands. The acropolis of Athens, oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.

Athens and the eastern coast of Attica were still occupied in the 12th century BC, and were not destroyed or abandoned; this points to the existence of new decentralized coastal and maritime networks there. It is attested by the cemetery of Perati that lasted a century and showed imports from Cyclades, Dodecanese, Crete, Cyprus, Egypt and Syria, as well as by the Late Helladic IIIC (–1040 BC) cemetery of Drivlia at Porto Rafti; located 2 km west of Perati. This indicates that Attica participated in long-distance trade, and was also incorporated in a mainland-looking network.

The site of Mycenae experienced a gradual loss of political and economic status, while Tiryns, also in the Argolid region, expanded its settlement and became the largest local center during the post-palatial period, in Late Helladic IIIC, c. 1200–1050 BC.

====Hypotheses for the collapse====

The reasons for the end of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. At present, there is no satisfactory explanation for the collapse of the Mycenaean palace systems. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict. The first attributes the destruction of Mycenaean sites to invaders.

The hypothesis of a Dorian invasion, known as such in Ancient Greek tradition, that led to the end of Mycenaean Greece, is supported by sporadic archaeological evidence such as new types of burials, in particular cist graves, and the use of a new dialect of Greek, the Doric one. It appears that the Dorians moved southward gradually over a number of years and devastated the territory, until they managed to establish themselves in the Mycenaean centers. A new type of ceramic also appeared, called &quot;Barbarian Ware&quot; because it was attributed to invaders from the north. On the other hand, the collapse of Mycenaean Greece coincides with the activity of the Sea Peoples in the Eastern Mediterranean. They caused widespread destruction in Anatolia and the Levant and were finally defeated by Pharaoh Ramesses III in c. 1175 BC. One of the ethnic groups that comprised these people were the &quot;Eqwesh&quot;, a name that appears to be linked with the Ahhiyawa of the Hittite inscriptions.

Alternative scenarios propose that the fall of Mycenaean Greece was a result of internal disturbances which led to internecine warfare among the Mycenaean states or civil unrest in a number of states, as a result of the strict hierarchical social system and the ideology of the wanax. In general, due to the obscure archaeological picture in 12th–11th century BC Greece, there is a continuing controversy among scholars over whether the impoverished societies that succeeded the Mycenaean palatial states were newcomers or populations that already resided in Mycenaean Greece. Recent archaeological findings tend to favor the latter scenario. Additional theories, concerning natural factors, such as climate change, droughts, or earthquakes have also been proposed. Another theory considers the decline of the Mycenaean civilization as a manifestation of a common pattern for the decline of many ancient civilizations: the Minoan, the Harappan and the Western Roman Empire; the reason for the decline is migration due to overpopulation. The period following the end of Mycenaean Greece, c. 1100–800 BC, is generally termed the &quot;Greek Dark Ages&quot;.

==Political organization==
===Palatial states===
Mycenaean palatial states, or centrally organized palace-operating polities, are recorded in ancient Greek literature and mythology (e.g., &quot;Iliad&quot;, Catalogue of Ships) and confirmed by discoveries made by modern archaeologists such as Heinrich Schliemann. Each Mycenaean kingdom was governed from the palace, which exercised control over most, if not all, industries within its realm. The palatial territory was divided into several sub-regions, each headed by its provincial center. Each province was further divided in smaller districts, the &quot;damoi&quot;. A number of palaces and fortifications appear to be part of a wider kingdom. For instance, Gla, located in the region of Boeotia, belonged to the state of nearby Orchomenos. Moreover, the palace of Mycenae appeared to have ruled over a territory two to three times the size of the other palatial states in Bronze Age Greece. Its territory would have also included adjacent centers, including Tiryns and Nauplion, which could plausibly be ruled by a member of Mycenae&#x27;s ruling dynasty.

The unearthed Linear B texts are too fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape in Mycenaean Greece and they do not support nor deny the existence of a larger Mycenaean state. On the other hand, contemporary Hittite and Egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state under a &quot;Great King&quot;. Alternatively, based on archaeological data, some sort of confederation among a number of palatial states appears to be possible. If some kind of united political entity existed, the dominant center was probably located in Thebes or in Mycenae, with the latter state being the most probable center of power.

===Society and administration===

The Neolithic agrarian village (6000 BC) constituted the foundation of Bronze Age political culture in Greece. The vast majority of the preserved Linear B records deal with administrative issues and give the impression that Mycenaean palatial administration was highly systematized, featuring thoroughly consistent language, terminology, tax calculations, and distribution logistics. Considering this sense of uniformity, the Pylos archive, which is the best preserved one in the Mycenaean world, is generally taken as a representative one.
The state was ruled by a king, the &quot;wanax&quot; (ϝάναξ), whose role was religious and perhaps also military and judicial. The wanax oversaw virtually all aspects of palatial life, from religious feasting and offerings to the distribution of goods, craftsmen and troops. Under him was the (&quot;the leader of the people&quot;), whose role appears mainly religious. His activities possibly overlap with the wanax and is usually seen as the second-in-command. Both wanax and lāwāgetas were at the head of a military aristocracy known as the (&quot;companions&quot; or &quot;followers&quot;). The land possessed by the &quot;wanax&quot; is usually the (te-me-no). There is also at least one instance of a person, Enkhelyawon, at Pylos, who appears titleless in the written record but whom modern scholars regard as probably a king.

A number of local officials positioned by the &quot;wanax&quot; appear to be in charge of the districts, such as &quot;ko-re-te&quot; (, &#x27;&quot;governor&quot;), &quot;po-ro-ko-re-te&quot; (, &quot;deputy&quot;) and the &quot;da-mo-ko-ro&quot; (&quot;damokoros&quot;, &quot;one who takes care of a damos&quot;), the latter probably being appointed to take charge of the commune. A council of elders was chaired, the &quot;ke-ro-si-ja&quot; (cf. γερουσία, ). The , who in later Greek society was the name of the king, refers to communal officials.

In general, Mycenaean society appears to have been divided into two groups of free men: the king&#x27;s entourage, who conducted administrative duties at the palace, and the people, &quot;&quot;. These last were watched over by royal agents and were obliged to perform duties for and pay taxes to the palace. Among those who could be found in the palace were well-to-do high officials, who probably lived in the vast residences found in proximity to Mycenaean palaces, but also others, tied by their work to the palace and not necessarily better off than the members of the &quot;da-mo&quot;, such as craftsmen, farmers, and perhaps merchants. Occupying a lower rung of the social ladder were the slaves, &quot;do-e-ro&quot;, (cf. , ). These are recorded in the texts as working either for the palace or for specific deities.

==Economy==

===Organization===
The Mycenaean economy, given its pre-monetary nature, was a palace economy, focusing on the redistribution of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel. The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods. For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000–100,000 sheep grazing in central Crete, and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated. The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.

Nevertheless, palatial control over resources appears to have been highly selective in spatial terms and in terms of how different industries were managed. Thus, sectors like the production of perfumed oil and bronze materials were directly monitored from the palace, but the production of ceramics was only indirectly monitored. Regional transactions between the palaces are also recorded on a few occasions.

===Large-scale infrastructure===
The palatial centers organized their workforce and resources for the construction of large scale projects in the fields of agriculture and industry. The magnitude of some projects indicates that this was the result of combined efforts from multiple palatial centers. Most notable of them are the drainage system of the Kopais basin in Boeotia, the building of a large dam outside Tiryns, and the drainage of the swamp in the Nemea valley. Also noticeable is the construction of harbors, such as the harbor of Pylos, that were capable of accommodating large Bronze Age era vessels like the one found at Uluburun. The Mycenaean economy also featured large-scale manufacturing as testified by the extent of workshop complexes that have been discovered, the largest known to date being the recent ceramic and hydraulic installations found in Euonymeia, next to Athens, that produced tableware, textiles, sails, and ropes for export and shipbuilding.

The most famous project of the Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have facilitated the speedy deployment of troops—for example, the remnants of a Mycenaean road, along with what appears to have been a Mycenaean defensive wall on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have been limited to the Argive plain.

===Trade===
Trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the economy of Mycenaean Greece. The Mycenaean palaces imported raw materials, such as metals, ivory and glass, and exported processed commodities and objects made from these materials, in addition to local products: oil, perfume, wine, wool and pottery. International trade of that time was not only conducted by palatial emissaries but also by independent merchants.

Based on archaeological findings in the Middle East, in particular physical artifacts, textual references, inscriptions and wall paintings, it appears that Mycenaean Greeks achieved strong commercial and cultural interaction with most of the Bronze Age people living in this region: Canaanites, Kassites, Mitanni, Assyrians, and Egyptians. The 14th century BC Uluburun shipwreck, off the coast of southern Anatolia, displays the established trade routes that supplied the Mycenaeans with all the raw materials and items that the economy of Mycenaean Greece needed, such as copper and tin for the production of bronze products. A chief export of the Mycenaeans was olive oil, which was a multi-purpose product.

Cyprus appears to be the principal intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there. On the other hand, trade with the Hittite lands in central Anatolia appears to have been limited. Trade with Troy is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the Bosphorus and the shores of the Black Sea. Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as Georgia in the eastern Black Sea coast.

Commercial interaction was also intense with the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean. Mycenaean products, especially pottery, were exported to southern Italy, Sicily and the Aeolian Islands. Mycenaean products also penetrated further into Sardinia, as well as southern Spain.

Sporadic objects of Mycenaean manufacture were found in various distant locations, like in Central Europe, such as in Bavaria, Germany, where an amber object inscribed with Linear B symbols has been unearthed. Mycenaean bronze double axes and other objects dating from the 13th century BC have been found in Ireland and in Wessex and Cornwall in England.

Anthropologists have found traces of opium in Mycenaean ceramic vases. The drug trade in Mycenaean Greece is traced as early as 1650–1350 BC, with opium poppies being traded in the eastern Mediterranean.

==Religion==
Temples and shrines are strangely rare in the Mycenaean archaeological sites. Monumental cultic structures are absent at all the palatial centers, with the exception of Mycenae. However, the cultic center of Mycenae seems to have been a later (13th century BC) development. Small shrines have been identified in Asine, Berbati, Malthi and Pylos, while a number of sacred enclosures have been located near Mycenae, Delphi and Amyclae. Linear B records mention a number of sanctuaries dedicated to a variety of deities, at least in Pylos and Knossos. They also indicate that there were various religious festivities including offerings. Written Mycenaean records mention various priests and priestesses who were responsible for specific shrines and temples. The latter were prominent figures in society, and the role of Mycenaean women in religious festivities was also important, just as in Minoan Crete.

The Mycenaean pantheon already included many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece, although it is difficult to determine whether these deities had the characteristics and responsibilities that would be attributed to them in later periods. In general, the same divinities were worshipped throughout the Mycenaean palatial world. There may be some indications for local deities at various sites, in particular in Crete. The uniformity of Mycenaean religion is also reflected in archaeological evidence with the phi- and psi-figurines that have been found all over Late Bronze Age Greece.

Poseidon (Linear B: &quot;Po-se-da-o&quot;) seems to have occupied a place of privilege. He was a chthonic deity, connected with earthquakes (&quot;E-ne-si-da-o-ne&quot;: Earth-shaker), but it seems that he also represented the river spirit of the underworld. Paean (&quot;Pa-ja-wo&quot;) is probably the precursor of the Greek physician of the gods in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. He was the personification of the magic-song which was supposed to &quot;heal&quot; the patient. A number of divinities have been identified in the Mycenaean scripts only by their epithets used during later antiquity. For example, &quot;Qo-wi-ja&quot; (&quot;cow-eyed&quot;) is a standard Homeric epithet of Hera. Ares appeared under the name &quot;Enyalios&quot; (assuming that &quot;Enyalios&quot; is not a separate god). Additional divinities that can be also found in later periods include Hephaestus, Erinya, Artemis (&quot;a-te-mi-to&quot; and &quot;a-ti-mi-te&quot;) and Dionysos (&quot;Di-wo-nu-so&quot;). Zeus also appears in the Mycenaean pantheon, but he was certainly not the chief deity.

A collection of &quot;ladies&quot; or &quot;mistresses&quot;, &quot;Po-ti-ni-ja&quot; (&quot;Potnia&quot;) are named in the Mycenaean scripts. As such, Athena (&quot;A-ta-na&quot;) appears in an inscription at Knossos as &quot;mistress Athena&quot;, similar to a later Homeric expression, but in the Pylos tablets she is mentioned without any accompanying word. &quot;Si-to po-ti-ni-ja&quot; appears to be an agricultural goddess, possibly related to Demeter of later antiquity, while in Knossos there is the &quot;mistress of the Labyrinth&quot;. The &quot;two queens and the king&quot; (&quot;wa-na-ssoi&quot;, &quot;wa-na-ka-te&quot;) are mentioned in Pylos. Goddess &quot;Pe-re-swa&quot; mentioned may be related to Persephone. A number of Mycenaean divinities seem to have no later equivalents, such as Marineus, Diwia and Komawenteia.

==Women==
===Daily life===

By observing Mycenaean wall paintings, scholars have deduced that women during this time often wore long dresses, their hair long, and wore jewelry, most notably beads. Mycenaean beads have long been an aspect of Mycenaean culture that is shrouded in a significant amount of mystery. It is not known for certain why they (men, women, and children) wore them, or why they appear to have been significant to the culture, but beads made of carnelian, lapis lazuli, etc., were known to have been worn by women on bracelets, necklaces, and buttons on cloaks, and were often buried with the deceased.

In later periods of Greek history, seclusion of females from males was common in the household, though scholars have found no evidence of seclusion during Mycenaean times, and believe that males and females worked with and around each other on a regular basis. Not much is known about women&#x27;s duties in the home or whether they differed from the duties of men. And though men were involved in warfare and hunting, there is no evidence that suggests women ever took part in either of the two, though whether women took part in hunting has been up for debate amongst some historians. There is evidence that, in this patriarchal society, men and women were, in some respects, viewed equally. Mycenae practiced a system of rationing food to citizens, and evidence shows that women received the same amount of rations as men.

If women were not officials in the cult or married to high-ranking male officers, they were likely low-ranking laborers. Linear B details specialized groups of female laborers called &quot;workgroups&quot;. These women labored with other women as well as their children, and usually were located close to the palace. Women who belonged to workgroups did not belong to independent households, but were managed and fed by palace scribes. All of the women in a workgroup would serve the same occupation, such as textiles. Women in workgroups are not believed to have been able to acquire land holdings or have had economic independence of any kind, and are believed by some to have been slaves, though there are some conflicting debates among scholars concerning this. Though scholars are unsure if ordinary women could obtain land and exert economic power, there is evidence that women could obtain positions of power, such as the title of priestess, which allowed them to have land holdings, have elite connections, and high social status. Mycenaean society is believed to have been largely patriarchal, but women could exert social and economic power through titles and positions of power, like that of a priestess, though religion was not the only place that a woman could gain social authority. Women with special talents or skills, such as being a skilled midwife or craftswomen, could gain social authority in their villages, but are not believed to have been able to receive land holdings. Elite women (those who were married to male elites) were afforded benefits fitting their high social standing, but even the wife of elites could not own land and had no economic independence. Some scholars believe that Knossos was probably more equal in relation to gender than Pylos, though the evidence for this is little and is highly disputed.

===Religion===
Men and women alike were involved in cult activity. Some women could be elevated to becoming legally independent by becoming priestesses, which appears to be hereditary through both the male and female line. No woman in Mycenae is believed to have been able to &quot;own&quot; land at this time, but priestesses were women who could legally procure land. Through the cult, land was &quot;leased&quot; to them, rather than given to them in ownership. Along with land holding benefits, priestesses often had ties with the upper-class elites, and were usually wealthy themselves. Only a small number of women could become priestesses in Mycenae, but there were other cultic titles that women could aspire to obtain, such as that of &quot;Key-bearer&quot;. Key-bearers appear to be women who had authority over the sacred treasury of a particular deity, and were able to dispense it in times of need. Though scholars do not have enough evidence to suggest that all Key-bearers could own land and had high status, there is a written record in Linear B of a Key-bearer with elite ties who owned land, so it is possible that they had similar benefits to priestesses. Other religious roles filled by women were the three types of sacred slaves: slave of the God, slave of the Priestess, and slave of the Key-bearer. Though not as grand a title as that of &quot;Priestess of Key-Bearer&quot;, the sacred slaves were allotted certain benefits fitting their positions in the cult. One other documented position women filled in the cult was called &quot;ki-ri-te-wi-ja&quot;. Though documented, scholars are not certain exactly what the duties of this role entailed, or what type of women would have filled it. What they do know, however, is that these religious roles afforded the women who occupied them a certain amount of economic autonomy.

==Architecture==
===Palaces===

The palatial structures at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos were erected on the summits of hills or rocky outcrops, dominating the immediate surroundings. The best preserved are found in Pylos and Tiryns, while Mycenae and the Menelaion are only partially preserved. In Central Greece, Thebes and Orchomenos have been only partially exposed. On the other hand, the palace built at the acropolis of Athens has been almost completely destroyed. A substantial building at Dimini in Thessaly, possibly ancient Iolcos, is believed by a number of archaeologists to be a palace. A Mycenaean palace has been also unearthed in Laconia, near the modern village of Xirokambi.

The palatial structures of mainland Greece share a number of common features. The focal point of the socio-political aspect of a Mycenaean palace was the megaron, the throne room. It was laid out around a circular hearth surrounded by four columns. The throne was generally found on the right-hand side upon entering the room, while the interior of the megaron was lavishly decorated, flaunting images designed intentionally to demonstrate the political and religious power of the ruler. Access to the megaron was provided through a court, which was reached from a propylon. The iconography of the palatial chambers is remarkably uniform throughout Greece. For instance, in Pylos and Tiryns the paintings are focused on marine motifs, providing depictions of octopodes, fish and dolphins. Around the megaron a group of courtyards each opened upon several rooms of different dimensions, such as storerooms and workshops, as well as reception halls and living quarters. In general Mycenaean palaces have yielded a wealth of artifacts and fragmentary frescoes.

Additional common features are shared by the palaces of Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns; a large court with colonnades lies directly in front of the central megaron, while a second, but smaller, megaron is also found inside these structures. The staircases in the palace of Pylos indicate that the palaces had two stories. The private quarters of the members of the royal family were presumably located on the first floor.

===Fortifications===

The construction of defensive structures was closely linked to the establishment of the palaces in mainland Greece. The principal Mycenaean centers were well-fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain, like on the Acropolis of Athens, Tiryns and Mycenae or on coastal plains, in the case of Gla. Mycenaean Greeks in general appreciated the symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture, reflected by the visual impressiveness of their fortifications.

&quot;Cyclopean&quot; is the term normally applied to the masonry characteristics of Mycenaean fortification systems and describes walls built of large, unworked boulders more than thick and weighing several metric tonnes. They were roughly fitted together without the use of mortar or clay to bind them, though smaller hunks of limestone fill the interstices. Their placement formed a polygonal pattern giving the curtain wall an irregular but imposing appearance. At the top it would have been wide enough for a walkway with a narrow protective parapet on the outer edge and with hoop-like crenellations. The term &quot;Cyclopean&quot; was derived by the latter Greeks of the Classical era who believed that only the mythical giants, the Cyclopes, could have constructed such megalithic structures. On the other hand, cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways. Another typical feature of Mycenaean megalithic construction was the use of a relieving triangle above a lintel block—an opening, often triangular, designed to reduce the weight over the lintel. The space was filled with some lighter stone.

Cyclopean fortifications were typical of Mycenaean walls, especially at the citadels of Mycenae, Tiryns, Argos, Crisa and Athens, while smaller boulders are found in Midea and large limestone slabs are found at Gla. In the Mycenaean settlements found in Epirus and Cyprus, Cyclopean-style walls are also present, as well as in western Anatolia. Besides the citadels, isolated forts were also erected on various strategic locations. The fortification systems also incorporated technical refinements such as secret cisterns, galleries, sally ports and projecting bastions for the protection of gateways. On the other hand, the palace of Pylos, although a major center of power, paradoxically appears to have been left without any defensive walls.

===Other architectural features===
Mycenaean domestic architecture originates mainly from earlier Middle Helladic traditions (–1650 BC) both in shape, as well as in location of settlement. The observed uniformity in domestic architecture came probably as a result of a shared past among the communities of the Greek mainland rather than as a consequence of cultural expansion of the Mycenaean Koine. Moreover, varying sizes of mudbricks were used in the construction of buildings.

Contrary to popular belief, some Mycenaean representative buildings already featured roofs made of fired tiles, as in Gla and Midea.

==Warfare==

The military nature of the Mycenaean Greeks is evident from the numerous weapons unearthed, the use of warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, and the preserved Greek Linear B records. The Mycenaeans invested in the development of military infrastructure, with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centers. According to the Linear B records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the &quot;damos&quot;) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army. Similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.

Mycenaean armies were initially based on heavy infantry, equipped with spears, large shields and on some occasions, armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry and armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors, while the sword played a secondary role in combat. Other offensive weapons used were bows, maces, axes, slings and javelins. The precise role and contribution of chariots on the battlefield is a matter of dispute due to the lack of sufficient evidence. It appears that chariots were initially used as fighting vehicles during the 16th to 14th centuries BC, while later, in the 13th century BC, their role was limited to battlefield transport.

The boar&#x27;s tusk helmet was the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor in use from the beginning to the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean. A representative piece of Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (–1400 BC) which consisted of a cuirass of a complete set of armor made up of several elements of bronze. In general, most features of the later hoplite panoply of classical Greek antiquity, were already known to Mycenaean Greece. &quot;Figure-of-eight&quot; shields were the most common type of Mycenaean shields. During the Late Mycenaean period, smaller types of shields were adopted, either of completely circular shape, or almost circular with a part cut out from their lower edge.

==Art and pottery==
Most of the finest Mycenaean art comes under the immediate suspicion of either being Minoan art actually imported from Crete, or produced on the mainland by Cretan or Cretan-trained artists. This is less true of pottery, although the (very untypical) Mycenaean palace amphora with octopus (NAMA 6725) clearly derives directly from the Minoan &quot;Marine Style&quot;, and it ceases to be the case after about 1350 BC. Some works appear to have subjects adjusted to warlike Mycenaean tastes, although the distinctively Minoan subject of bull-leaping also appears. The production of luxury art for, and probably often in, the Minoan palaces was already a well-established tradition when Mycenaean elites became customers, and was perhaps more integrated into Minoan religion and culture than it ever became in Mycenaean Greece.

===Metalwork===
Several important pieces in gold and other metals come from the Gold grave goods at Grave Circles A and B at Mycenae, including the Mask of Agamemnon, Silver Siege Rhyton, Bulls-head rhyton, and gold Nestor&#x27;s Cup. The chemical compositions of the silver objects indicate that the silver was sourced from several locations. The Theseus Ring, found in Athens, is one of the finest of a number of gold signet rings with tiny multi-figure scenes of high quality, many from the princely Grave Circles A and B at Mycenae. These tend to be regarded as Cretan, as do the carved gemstones also found in elite graves. Though they collected them, the Mycenaean elite did not apparently use Minoan seals for authenticating anything, but treated them as ornaments, at least one prince wearing a collection around his wrists, like modern charm bracelets. Sinclair Hood believed that at the time of the Vaphio burial (c. 1500–1450) &quot;it was broadly speaking possible to classify the finer seals as being of Cretan, the more crudely engraved of mainland manufacture&quot;, but that &quot;this criterion no longer applies after the mainland conquest of Crete &quot;.

===Vessels===

During the Late Mycenaean period (1400–1200 BC), Mycenaean vessels/pottery exhibited similarities spanning a significant area of the Eastern Mediterranean (i.e., from the Levant to Sicily) and possibly reflecting a form of economic and political union centered at Mycenae. However, the Minoan pottery of Crete during this time remained distinct indicating a degree of autonomy on the island. The Mycenaean Greeks produced in large quantities a variety of diversely-styled vessels such as stirrup jars, large bowls, alabastron, krater and stemmed cups (or kylikes) resembling champagne glasses.

Stirrup jars (Linear B: , ; &quot;oil vessel&quot;), specifically, were first invented on the island of Crete during the 16th century BC and used widely by the Mycenaeans from 1400 BC onward for transporting and storing wine and oil; the jars were usually pear-shaped or globular. As for stemmed cups (or kylikes), they evolved from Ephyraean goblets and a large quantity was discovered at a site called the &quot;Potter&#x27;s Shop&quot; located in Zygouries. Mycenaean drinking vessels such as the stemmed cups contained single decorative motifs such as a shell, an octopus or a flower painted on the side facing away from the drinker. The Mycenaean Greeks also painted entire scenes (called &quot;Pictorial Style&quot;) on their vessels depicting warriors, chariots, horses and deities reminiscent of events described in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. Other items developed by the Mycenaeans include clay lamps, as well as metallic vessels such as bronze tripod cauldrons (or basins). A few examples of vessels in faience and ivory are also known.

===Figures and figurines===
The Mycenaean period has not yielded sculpture of any great size. The statuary of the period consists for the most part of small terracotta figurines found at almost every Mycenaean site in mainland Greece—in tombs, in settlement debris, and occasionally in cult contexts (Tiryns, Agios Konstantinos on Methana). The majority of these figurines are female and anthropomorphic or zoomorphic.
The female figurines can be subdivided into three groups, which were popular at different periods: the Psi and phi type figurines, and the Tau-type. The earliest are the Phi-type, which look like the Greek letter Phi (their arms give the upper body a rounded shape). The Psi-type looks like the letter Psi (these have outstretched upraised arms). The latest (12th century BC) are the Tau-type; these figurines look like the Greek letter Tau (with folded arms at right angles to the body). Most figurines wear a large polos. They are painted with stripes or zigzags in the same manner as the contemporary pottery and presumably made by the same potters. Their purpose is uncertain, but they may have served as both votive objects and toys: some are found in children&#x27;s graves but the vast majority of fragments are from domestic rubbish deposits.

The presence of many of these figurines on sites where worship took place in the Archaic and Classical periods (approximately 200 below the sanctuary of Athena at Delphi, others at the temple of Aphaea on Aegina, at the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas above Epidauros and at Amyclae near Sparta), suggests both that many were indeed religious in nature, perhaps as votives, but also that later places of worship may well have first been used in the Mycenaean period.

Larger male, female or bovine terracotta wheelmade figures are much rarer. An important group was found in the Temple at Mycenae together with coiled clay snakes, while others have been found at Tiryns and in the East and West Shrines at Phylakopi on the island of Melos.

===Frescoes===
The painting of the Mycenaean age was much influenced by that of Minoan painting, and was probably at least initially by Cretan painters. Their style gradually drifts away from that of Crete, and in late periods greatly reduces in quality. Fragments of wall paintings have been found in or around the palaces (Pylos, Mycenae, Tiryns) and in domestic contexts (Zygouries). The largest complete wall painting depicting three female figures, probably goddesses, was found in the so-called &quot;cult center&quot; at Mycenae. Various subjects are represented: hunting, bull leaping (tauromachy), battle scenes, processions, etc. Some scenes may be part of mythological narratives, but if so their meaning eludes us. Other frescoes include geometric or stylised motifs, also used on painted pottery (see above).

==Burial practices==
The usual form of burial during this period was inhumation (burial in the earth, covered by dirt and stones). The earliest Mycenaean burials were mostly in individual graves in the form of a pit or a stone-lined cist and offerings were limited to pottery and occasional items of jewellery. Groups of pit or cist graves containing elite members of the community were sometimes covered by a tumulus (mound) in the manner established since the Middle Helladic. It has been argued that this form dates back to the Kurgan culture; however, Mycenaean burials are in actuality an indigenous development of mainland Greece with the Shaft Graves housing native rulers. Pit and cist graves remained in use for single burials throughout the Mycenaean period alongside more elaborate family graves. The shaft graves at Mycenae within Grave Circles A and B belonging to the same period represent an alternative manner of grouping elite burials. Next to the deceased were found full sets of weapons, ornate staffs as well as gold and silver cups and other valuable objects which point to their social rank.

Beginning also in the Late Helladic period are to be seen communal tombs of rectangular form. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish whether the different forms of burial represent a social hierarchization, as was formerly thought, with the &quot;tholos&quot; being the tombs of the elite rulers, the individual tombs those of the leisure class, and the communal tombs those of the people. Cremations increased in number over the course of the period, becoming quite numerous in the last phase of the Mycenaean era. The tholos was introduced during the early 15th century BC as the new and more imposing form of elite burial. The most impressive tombs of the Mycenaean era are the monumental royal tombs of Mycenae, undoubtedly intended for the royal family of the city. The most famous is the Treasury of Atreus, a tholos. A total of nine of such tholos tombs are found in the region of Mycenae, while six of them belong to a single period (Late Helladic IIA, –1300 BC). It has been argued that different dynasties or factions may have competed through conspicuous burial.

==Cuisine==
With respect to Mycenaean cuisine, skewer trays were discovered in Gla, Mycenae, and Pylos. The so-called &quot;souvlaki trays&quot; (or portable grills) used by the Mycenaean Greeks were rectangular ceramic pans that sat underneath skewers of meat. It is not clear whether these trays would have been placed directly over a fire or if the pans would have held hot coals like a portable barbecue pit.

==Writing==
In , the Mycenaean Greeks borrowed from the Minoan civilization its syllabic writing system (i.e., Linear A) and developed their own syllabic script known as Linear B. The Linear B script was utilized by the Mycenaean palaces in Greece for administrative purposes where economic transactions were recorded on clay tablets and some pottery in the Mycenaean dialect of the Greek language. The Linear B tablets were first discovered in Crete by English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans and later deciphered by English architect and cryptographer Michael Ventris in 1952. Ventris&#x27;s discovery of an archaic Greek dialect in the Linear B tablets demonstrated that Mycenaean Greek was &quot;the oldest known Greek dialect, elements of which survived in Homer&#x27;s language as a result of a long oral tradition of epic poetry.&quot; The written records of every Mycenaean region were similar but the scribes sometimes used words that were probably part of their local dialect. The existence of a common language is probably explained by their shared bureaucratic system and writing script.

==Legacy==
In the 8th century BC, after the end of the so-called Greek Dark Ages, Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, the greatest of all being that of the Trojan Epic Cycle. In general, the Greeks of Classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The legends of Homer&#x27;s Epics were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer&#x27;s historicity. At this time, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of Mycenae in 1876. Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of the &quot;Iliad&quot; by identifying the places described by Homer.

As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity. Moreover, the language of the Mycenaeans offers the first written evidence of Greek, while a significant part of the Mycenaean vocabulary can also be found in modern English.

The Mycenaean Greeks were also pioneers in the field of engineering, launching large-scale projects unmatched in Europe until the Roman period, such as fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the relieving triangle. They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods, so it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.

There are scholars who identify the Sea Peoples who migrated to the Near East as Mycenaean Greeks. In a 2020 study by Polish historian Łukasz Niesiołowski-Spanò, a group of people known from the Bible – the Levites – were linguistically identified with the Greek term &quot;*la-wo&quot; (in later Greek &quot;laoi&quot;) – &quot;the people&quot; or &quot;armed men&quot;. Niesiołowski-Spanò concluded that the Levites were a group of Mycenaean Greek mercenaries who managed to settle down in Canaan and integrate with the local population, preserving their own group name.

==Genetic and anthropometric studies==
A cephalometric analysis by Argyropoulos et al. (1989) published in &quot;The Angle Orthodontist&quot; showed remarkable similarity in craniofacial morphology between ancient Greeks (including Mycenaeans) and modern Greeks, suggesting a close affinity, and that the Greek ethnic group remained stable in its cephalic and facial morphology for the last 4,000 years.

A craniofacial morphological study by Papagrigorakis et al. (2014) published in &quot;Anthropologischer Anzeiger&quot; also indicated craniological similarities between modern Greeks and ancient Greeks (including Mycenaeans), indicating continuity.

In an archaeogenetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot;, Lazaridis et al. (2017) found that Minoans and Mycenaean Greeks were genetically highly similar, but not identical; modern Greeks resembled the Mycenaeans, but with some additional dilution of the early Neolithic ancestry. Furthermore, proposed migrations by Egyptian or Phoenician colonists was not discernible in their data, thus &quot;rejecting the hypothesis that the cultures of the Aegean were seeded by migrants from the old civilizations of these regions.&quot; The F between the sampled Bronze Age populations and present-day West Eurasians was estimated, finding that Mycenaean Greeks and Minoans were least differentiated from the populations of modern Greece, Cyprus, Albania, and Italy.

A genetic study by Clemente et al. (2021) found that in the Early Bronze Age, the populations of the Minoan, Helladic, and Cycladic civilizations in the Aegean, were genetically homogeneous. In contrast, during the Middle Bronze Age, this population was more differentiated; probably due to gene flow from a Yamnaya-related population from the Pontic–Caspian steppe. This is corroborated by sequenced genomes of Middle Bronze Age individuals from northern Greece, who had a much higher proportion of steppe-related ancestry; the timing of this gene flow was estimated at 2,300 BCE, and is consistent with the dominant linguistic theories explaining the emergence of the Proto-Greek language. Present-day Greeks share about 90% of their ancestry with them, suggesting continuity between the two time periods. In the case of Mycenaeans however, this steppe-related ancestry was diluted. The ancestry of the Mycenaeans could be explained via a 2-way admixture model of such MBA individuals in northern Greece, and either an EBA Aegean or MBA Minoan population.

A study by Lazaridis et al. (2022) analysed 21 new Mycenaean samples and one new Minoan sample, along with previously published samples. The study found that Mycenaeans were differentiated from Minoans by an influx of western steppe (Yamnaya-like) ancestry, with Mycenaean samples having approximately steppe/Yamnaya-like ancestry on average, comprising Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) ancestry on average and an approximately matching amount of Caucasus hunter-gatherer ancestry ( on average), though some of the Mycenaeans lacked steppe ancestry altogether. Individual Mycenaean samples from mainland Greece had proportions of EHG ancestry ranging from 0% up to at Kastrouli, or at the Palace of Nestor. Another Mycenaean individual from Crete, dating from BC (Crete Armenoi) had EHG ancestry. The remaining (non steppe-related) Mycenaean ancestry was similar to that of the Minoans and the Early Bronze Age population of mainland Greece, and elite Mycenaean samples (from the Palace of Nestor at Pylos and its environs) did not differ from the general population in terms of their average ancestral composition. According to Lazaridis et al. these results strongly support the hypothesis that Mycenaeans were the outcome of admixture between descendants of Yamnaya-like steppe migrants and a Minoan-like population, with steppe migrants considered to be Indo-European speakers and progenitors of the Greek language. Minoans were predominantly of Early European Farmer ancestry ( on average), with additional Caucasus Hunter-Gatherer ancestry ( on average). Lazaridis et al. also identified Levant Pre-Pottery Neolithic ancestry in some Minoan and Mycenaean individuals.

In a comment on the study by Lazaridis et al. (2022), Paul Heggarty of the Max Planck Institute expressed doubts regarding the connection between the &quot;small contribution in Mycenaean Greece&quot; of the &quot;ancestral mix of Yamnaya culture&quot; and the steppe as the &quot;earliest, original source&quot; of Indo-European languages.

A study by Skourtanioti et al. (2023) generated genome-wide data from 95 Bronze Age individuals from mainland Greece and the Aegean, which was analysed in the context of all previously published samples from the region. Mycenaean (Late Bronze Age) individuals were found to deviate from Early Bronze Age individuals in the direction of Central and Eastern European Bronze Age populations, due to having western steppe-related ancestry not found in the earlier samples. The potential source of this ancestry included related groups from Serbia (Early Bronze Age), Croatia (Middle Bronze Age), Italy (Early and Middle Bronze Age), &#x27;Western Steppe Eneolithic-Bronze Age&#x27;, and &#x27;Germany Corded Ware&#x27;; the latter two were found to be the most adequate sources, but &quot;at the moment it is not possible to more closely identify the region(s) from where this genetic affinity was derived.&quot; Using &#x27;Germany Corded Ware&#x27; as a source proxy, it was estimated that Mycenaeans from the southern Greek mainland had 22.3% steppe-related ancestry on average, whereas Late Bronze Age individuals from nearby islands and the Cyclades had slightly lower amounts of this ancestry, and one individual from the island of Salamis had none; in Crete, samples dating from the 17th to the 16th centuries BC had minimal or no such steppe-related ancestry, whereas later samples dating from BC varied from 0% to approximately 40% steppe-related ancestry. This influx of steppe-related ancestry was related to Mycenaean domination of the island from the 15th century BC onwards, and was possibly also due in part to later migrations from more distant areas such as Italy.

<text>Hellenistic Greece is the historical period of Ancient Greece following Classical Greece and between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the annexation of the classical Greek Achaean League heartlands by the Roman Republic. This culminated at the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC, a crushing Roman victory in the Peloponnese that led to the destruction of Corinth and ushered in the period of Roman Greece. Hellenistic Greece&#x27;s definitive end was with the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, when the future emperor Augustus defeated Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony, the next year taking over Alexandria, the last great center of Hellenistic Greece.

The Hellenistic period began with the wars of the Diadochi, armed contests among the former generals of Alexander the Great to carve up his empire in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The wars lasted until 275 BC, witnessing the fall of both the Argead and Antipatrid dynasties of Macedonia in favor of the Antigonid dynasty. The era was also marked by successive wars between the Kingdom of Macedonia and its allies against the Aetolian League, Achaean League, and the city-state of Sparta.

During the reign of Philip V of Macedon (r. 221–179 BC), the Macedonians not only lost the Cretan War (205–200 BC) to an alliance led by Rhodes, but their erstwhile alliance with Hannibal of Carthage also entangled them in the First and Second Macedonian War with ancient Rome. The perceived weakness of Macedonia in the aftermath of these conflicts encouraged Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire to invade mainland Greece, yet his defeat by the Romans at Thermopylae in 191 BC and Magnesia in 190 BC secured Rome&#x27;s position as the leading military power in the region. Within roughly two decades after conquering Macedonia in 168 BC and Epirus in 167 BC, the Romans would eventually control the whole of Greece.

During the Hellenistic period the importance of Greece proper within the Greek-speaking world declined sharply. The great centers of Hellenistic culture were Alexandria and Antioch, capitals of Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria respectively. Cities such as Pergamon, Ephesus, Rhodes and Seleucia were also important, and increasing urbanisation of the Eastern Mediterranean was characteristic of the time.

==Macedon==

The quests of Alexander had a number of consequences for the Greek city-states. It greatly widened the horizons of the Greeks, making the endless conflicts between the cities which had marked the 5th and 4th centuries BC seem petty and unimportant. It led to a steady emigration, particularly of the young and ambitious, to the new Greek empires in the east. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch and the many other new Hellenistic cities founded in Alexander&#x27;s wake, as far away as what are now Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom survived until the end of the 1st century BC.

The defeat of the Greek cities by Philip and Alexander also taught the Greeks that their city-states could never again be powers in their own right, and that the hegemony of Macedon and its successor states could not be challenged unless the city states united, or at least federated. The Greeks valued their local independence too much to consider actual unification, but they made several attempts to form federations through which they could hope to reassert their independence.

Following Alexander&#x27;s death a struggle for power broke out among his generals, which resulted in the break-up of his empire and the establishment of a number of new kingdoms. Macedon fell to Cassander, son of Alexander&#x27;s leading general Antipater, who after several years of warfare made himself master of most of the rest of Greece. He founded a new Macedonian capital at Thessaloniki and was generally a constructive ruler.

Cassander&#x27;s power was challenged by Antigonus, ruler of Anatolia, who promised the Greek cities that he would restore their freedom if they supported him. This led to successful revolts against Cassander&#x27;s local rulers. In 307 BC, Antigonus&#x27;s son Demetrius captured Athens and restored its democratic system, which had been suppressed by Alexander. But in 301 BC a coalition of Cassander and the other Hellenistic kings defeated Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus, ending his challenge.
After Cassander&#x27;s death in 298 BC, however, Demetrius seized the Macedonian throne and gained control of most of Greece. He was defeated by a second coalition of Greek rulers in 285 BC, and mastery of Greece passed to the king Lysimachus of Thrace. Lysimachus was in turn defeated and killed in 280 BC. The Macedonian throne then passed to Demetrius&#x27;s son Antigonus II, who also defeated an invasion of the Greek lands by the Gauls, who at this time were living in the Balkans. The battle against the Gauls united the Antigonids of Macedon and the Seleucids of Antioch, an alliance which was also directed against the wealthiest Hellenistic power, the Ptolemies of Egypt.

Antigonus II ruled until his death in 239 BC, and his family retained the Macedonian throne until it was abolished by the Romans in 146 BC. Their control over the Greek city states was intermittent, however, since other rulers, particularly the Ptolemies, subsidised anti-Macedonian parties in Greece to undermine the Antigonids&#x27; power. Antigonus placed a garrison at Corinth, the strategic centre of Greece, but Athens, Rhodes, Pergamum and other Greek states retained substantial independence, and formed the Aetolian League as a means of defending it. Sparta also remained independent, but generally refused to join any league.

In 267 BC, Ptolemy II persuaded the Greek cities to revolt against Antigonus, in what became the Chremonidean War, after the Athenian leader Chremonides. The cities were defeated and Athens lost her independence and her democratic institutions. The Aetolian League was restricted to the Peloponnese, but on being allowed to gain control of Thebes in 245 BC became a Macedonian ally. This marked the end of Athens as a political actor, although it remained the largest, wealthiest and most cultivated city in Greece. In 255 BC, Antigonus defeated the Egyptian fleet at Cos and brought the Aegean islands, except Rhodes, under his rule as well.

==City states and leagues==
In spite of their decreased political power and autonomy, the Greek city state or polis continued to be the basic form of political and social organization in Greece. Classical city states such as Athens and Ephesus grew and even thrived in this period. While warfare between Greek cities continued, the cities responded to the threat of the post Alexandrian Hellenistic states by banding together into alliances or becoming allies of a strong Hellenistic state which could come to its defense therefore making it &quot;asylos&quot; or inviolate to attack by other cities.

The Aetolians and the Achaeans developed strong federal states or leagues (&quot;koinon&quot;), which were governed by councils of city representatives and assemblies of league citizens. Initially ethnic leagues, these leagues later began to include cities outside of their traditional regions. The Achaean League eventually included all of the Peloponnese except Sparta, while the Aetolian League expanded into Phocis. During the third century BCE these leagues were able to defend themselves against Macedon and the Aetolian league defeated a Celtic invasion of Greece at Delphi.

After Alexander&#x27;s death, Athens had been defeated by Antipater in the Lamian War and its port in the Piraeus housed a Macedonian garrison. To counter the power of Macedon under Cassander, Athens courted alliances with other Hellenistic rulers such as Antigonus I Monophthalmus, and in 307 Antigonus sent his son Demetrius to capture the city. After Demetrius captured Macedon, Athens became allied with Ptolemaic Egypt in an effort to gain its independence from Demetrius, and with Ptolemaic troops they managed to rebel and defeat Macedon in 287, though the Piraeus remained garrisoned. Athens fought more unsuccessful wars against Macedon with Ptolemaic aid such as the Chremonidean War. The Ptolemaic kingdom was now the city&#x27;s main ally, supporting it with troops, monies and material in multiple conflicts. Athens rewarded the Ptolemaic Kingdom in 224/223 BC by naming the 13th phyle Ptolemais and establishing a religious cult called the Ptolemaia. Hellenistic Athens also saw the rise of New Comedy and the Hellenistic schools of philosophy such as Stoicism and Epicureanism. By the turn of the century, the Attalids in Pergamon became patrons and protectors of Athens as the Ptolemaic empire weakened. Athens would later also establish a cult for the Pergamene king Attalos I.

==Philip V==
Antigonus II died in 239 BC. His death saw another revolt of the city-states of the Achaean League, whose dominant figure was Aratus of Sicyon. Antigonus&#x27;s son Demetrius II died in 229 BC, leaving a child (Philip V) as king, with the general Antigonus Doson as regent. The Achaeans, while nominally subject to Ptolemy, were in effect independent, and controlled most of southern Greece. Athens remained aloof from this conflict by common consent.

Sparta remained hostile to the Achaeans, and in 227 BC Sparta&#x27;s king Cleomenes III invaded Achaea and seized control of the League. Aratus preferred distant Macedon to nearby Sparta, and allied himself with Doson, who in 222 BC defeated the Spartans and annexed their city – the first time Sparta had ever been occupied by a foreign power.

Philip V, who came to power when Doson died in 221 BC, was the last Macedonian ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite Greece and preserve its independence against the &quot;cloud rising in the west&quot;: the ever-increasing power of Rome. He was known as &quot;the darling of Hellas&quot;. Under his auspices the Peace of Naupactus (217 BC) brought conflict between Macedon and the Greek leagues to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes and Pergamum.

In 215 BC, however, Philip formed an alliance with Rome&#x27;s enemy Carthage, which drew Rome directly into Greek affairs for the first time. Rome promptly lured the Achaean cities away from their nominal loyalty to Philip, and formed alliances with Rhodes and Pergamum, now the strongest power in Asia Minor. The First Macedonian War broke out in 212 BC, and ended inconclusively in 205 BC, but Macedon was now marked as an enemy of Rome. Rome&#x27;s ally Rhodes gained control of the Aegean islands.

In 202 BC, Rome defeated Carthage, and was free to turn her attention eastwards, urged on by her Greek allies, Rhodes and Pergamum. In 198 BC, the Second Macedonian War broke out for obscure reasons, but very likely because Rome saw Macedon as a potential ally of the Seleucids, the greatest power in the east. Philip&#x27;s allies in Greece deserted him and in 197 BC he was decisively defeated at the Cynoscephalae by the Roman proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus.

Luckily for the Greeks, Flamininus was a moderate man and an admirer of Greek culture. Philip had to surrender his fleet and become a Roman ally, but was otherwise spared. At the Isthmian Games in 196 BC, Flamininus declared all the Greek cities free, although Roman garrisons were placed at Corinth and Chalcis. But the freedom promised by Rome was an illusion. All the cities except Rhodes were enrolled in a new League which Rome ultimately controlled, and democracies were replaced by aristocratic regimes allied to Rome.

==Rise of Rome==

In 192 BC, war broke out between Rome and the Seleucid ruler Antiochus III. Antiochus invaded Greece with a 10,000 man army, and was elected the commander in chief of the Aetolians. Some Greek cities now thought of Antiochus as their saviour from Roman rule, but Macedon threw its lot in with Rome. In 191 BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at Magnesia on the Sipylum (190 BC). Greece now lay across Rome&#x27;s line of communications with the east, and Roman soldiers became a permanent presence. The Peace of Apamaea (188 BC) left Rome in a dominant position throughout Greece.

During the following years Rome was drawn deeper into Greek politics, since the defeated party in any dispute appealed to Rome for help. Macedon was still independent, though nominally a Roman ally. When Philip V died in 179 BC, he was succeeded by his son Perseus, who like all the Macedonian kings dreamed of uniting the Greeks under Macedonian rule. Macedon was now too weak to achieve this objective, but Rome&#x27;s ally Eumenes II of Pergamum persuaded Rome that Perseus was a potential threat to Rome&#x27;s position.

==End of Greek independence==

As a result of Eumenes&#x27;s intrigues Rome declared war on Macedon in 171 BC, bringing 100,000 troops into Greece. Macedon was no match for this army, and Perseus was unable to rally the other Greek states to his aid. Poor generalship by the Romans enabled him to hold out for three years, but in 168 BC the Romans sent Lucius Aemilius Paullus to Greece, and at Pydna the Macedonians were crushingly defeated. Perseus was captured and taken to Rome, the Macedonian kingdom was broken up into four smaller states, and all the Greek cities who aided her, even rhetorically, were punished. Even Rome&#x27;s allies Rhodes and Pergamum effectively lost their independence.

Under the leadership of an adventurer called Andriscus, Macedon rebelled against Roman rule in 149 BC: as a result it was directly annexed the following year and became a Roman province, the first of the Greek states to suffer this fate. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and, feeling that they might as well die fighting, declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans&#x27; side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul Lucius Mummius advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at Corinth, which was razed to the ground.

In 146 BC, the Greek peninsula, though not the islands, became a Roman protectorate. Roman taxes were imposed, except in Athens and Sparta, and all the cities had to accept rule by Rome&#x27;s local allies. In 133 BC, the last king of Pergamum died and left his kingdom to Rome: this brought most of the Aegean peninsula under direct Roman rule as part of the province of Asia.

The final downfall of Greece came in 88 BC, when King Mithridates of Pontus rebelled against Rome, and massacred up to 100,000 Romans and Roman allies across Asia Minor. Although Mithridates was not Greek, many Greek cities, including Athens, overthrew their Roman puppet rulers and joined him. When he was driven out of Greece by the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Roman vengeance fell upon Greece again, and the Greek cities never recovered. Mithridates was finally defeated by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) in 65 BC.

Further ruin was brought to Greece by the Roman civil wars, which were partly fought in Greece. Finally, in 27 BC, Augustus directly annexed Greece to the new Roman Empire as the province of Achaea. The struggles with Rome had left certain areas of Greece depopulated and demoralised. Nevertheless, Roman rule at least brought an end to warfare, and cities such as Athens, Corinth, Thessaloniki and Patras soon recovered their prosperity.

<doc id="565608" wikidata="Q2905322" url="?curid=565608" title="Byzantine Greece">
<text>Byzantine Greece has a history that mainly coincides with that of the Byzantine Empire itself.

==Background: Roman Greece==

The Greek peninsula became a Roman protectorate in 146 BC, and the Aegean islands were added to this territory in 133 BC. Athens and other Greek cities revolted in 88 BC, and the peninsula was crushed by the Roman general Sulla. The Roman civil wars devastated the land even further, until Augustus organized the peninsula as the province of Achaea in 27 BC.

Greece was a typical eastern province of the Roman Empire. The Romans sent colonists there and contributed new buildings to its cities, especially in the Agora of Athens, where the Agrippeia of Marcus Agrippa, the Library of Titus Flavius Pantaenus, and the Tower of the Winds, among others, were built. Romans tended to be philhellenic and Greeks were generally loyal to Rome.

Life in Greece continued under the Roman Empire much the same as it had previously, and Greek continued to be the lingua franca in the Eastern and most important part of the Empire. Roman culture was heavily influenced by classical Greek culture (see Greco-Roman) as Horace said, &quot;Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit&quot; (Translation: &quot;Captive Greece took captive her rude conqueror&quot;). The epics of Homer inspired the Aeneid of Virgil, and authors such as Seneca the Younger wrote using Greek styles, while famous Romans such as Scipio Africanus, Julius Caesar and Marcus Aurelius compiled works in the Greek language.

During that period, Greek intellectuals such as Galen or Apollodorus of Damascus were continuously being brought to Rome. Within the city of Rome, Greek was spoken by Roman elites, particularly philosophers, and by lower, working classes such as sailors and merchants. The emperor Nero visited Greece in 66, and performed at the Olympic Games, despite the rules against non-Greek participation. He was, of course, honored with a victory in every contest, and in 67 he proclaimed the freedom of the Greeks at the Isthmian Games in Corinth, just as Flamininus had over 200 years previously.

Hadrian was also particularly fond of the Greeks; before he became emperor he served as eponymous archon of Athens. He also built his namesake arch there, and had a Greek lover, Antinous.

At the same time, Greece and much of the rest of the Roman east came under the influence of Christianity. The apostle Paul had preached in Corinth and Athens, and Greece soon became one of the most highly Christianized areas of the empire.

==Early years (4th century)==

During the second and third centuries, Greece was divided into provinces including Achaea, Macedonia, Epirus vetus and Thracia. During the reign of Diocletian in the late 3rd century, the western Balkans were organized as a Roman diocese, and was ruled by Galerius. Under Constantine I Greece was part of the dioceses of Macedonia and Thrace. The eastern and southern Aegean islands formed the province of Insulae in the Diocese of Asia.

Greece faced invasions from the Heruli, Goths, and Vandals during the reign of Theodosius I. Stilicho, who acted as regent for Arcadius, evacuated Thessaly when the Visigoths invaded in the late 4th century. Arcadius&#x27; Chamberlain Eutropius allowed Alaric to enter Greece, and he looted Corinth, and the Peloponnese. Stilicho eventually drove him out around 397 and Alaric was made &quot;magister militum&quot; in Illyricum. Eventually, Alaric and the Goths migrated to Italy, sacked Rome in 410, and built the Visigothic Empire in Iberia and southern France, which lasted until 711 with the advent of the Arabs.

Greece remained part of the relatively unified eastern half of the empire. Contrary to outdated visions of late antiquity, the Greek peninsula was most likely one of the most prosperous regions of the Roman and later the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire. Older scenarios of poverty, depopulation, barbarian destruction and civil decay have been revised in light of recent archaeological discoveries. In fact, the &quot;polis&quot;, as an institution, appears to have remained prosperous until at least the sixth century. Contemporary texts such as Hierocles&#x27; &quot;Synecdemus&quot; affirm that in late Antiquity, Greece was highly urbanised and contained approximately 80 cities. This view of extreme prosperity is widely accepted today, and it is assumed between the 4th and 7th centuries AD, Greece may have been one of the most economically active regions in the eastern Mediterranean.

Following the loss of Alexandria and Antioch to the Arabs, Thessaloniki became the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s second largest city, called the &quot;co-regent&quot; (&quot;symbasileuousa&quot;), second only to Constantinople. The Greek peninsula remained one of the strongest centers of Christianity in the late Roman and early Byzantine periods. After the area&#x27;s recovery from the Slavic invasions, its wealth was restored. Events such as the Seljuk invasion of Asia Minor and the Latin occupation of Constantinople gradually focused Byzantine imperial interest to the Greek peninsula during the late Byzantine period. The Peloponnese in particular continued to prosper economically and intellectually even during its Latin domination, the Byzantine recovery, and until its final fall to the Ottoman Empire.

==Reorganization and external threats (5th–8th centuries)==


Greece was raided in Macedonia in 479 and 482 by the Ostrogoths under their king, Theodoric the Great (493–526). The Bulgars also raided Thrace and the rest of northern Greece in 540 and on repeated other occasions. These continuing Bulgar invasions required the Byzantine Empire to build a defensive wall, called the &quot;Anastasian Wall,&quot; that extended for some thirty (30) miles, or more, from the city of Selymbria (now Silivri) to the Black Sea. The Huns and Bulgars raided Greece in 559 until the Byzantine army returned from Italy, where Justinian I had been attempting to capture the heart of the Roman Empire.

According to historical documents, the Slavs invaded and settled in parts of Greece beginning in 579 and Byzantium nearly lost control of the entire peninsula during the 580s. However, there is no archaeological evidence indicating Slavic penetration of imperial Byzantine territories before the end of the 6th century. Overall, traces of Slavic culture in Greece are very rare.


The city of Thessaloniki remained unconquered even after being attacked by the Slavs around 615. The Slavs were eventually defeated, gathered by the Byzantines and placed into segregated communities known as Sclaviniae.

In 610, Heraclius became Emperor. During his reign, Greek became the official language of the empire.

During the early 7th century, Constans II made the first mass-expulsions of Slavs from the Greek peninsula to the Balkans and central Asia Minor. Justinian II defeated and destroyed most of the Sclaviniae, and moved as many as 100–200,000 Slavs from the Greek peninsula to Bithynia, while he enlisted some 30,000 Slavs in his army.

The Slavic populations that were placed in these segregated communities were used for military campaigns against the enemies of the Byzantines. In the Peloponnese, more Slavic invaders brought disorder to the western part of the peninsula, while the eastern part remained firmly under Byzantine domination. Empress Irene organised a military campaign which liberated those territories and restored Byzantine rule to the region, but it was not until emperor Nicephorus I&#x27;s reign that the last trace of Slavic element was eliminated: when the Slavs first occupied the Peloponnese in the 6th century, a number Greeks had fled Patras and found refuge near Reggio Calabria, in southern Italy; the descendants of these refugees were ordered to return by Nicephorus, who resettled them in the Peloponnese.

In the mid-7th century, the empire was reorganized into &quot;themes&quot; by the Emperor Constans II, including the Theme of Thrace, the naval &quot;Karabisianoi&quot; corps in southern Greece and the Aegean islands. The &quot;Karabisanoi&quot; were later divided by Justinian II into the Theme of Hellas (centred on Corinth) and the Cibyrrhaeotic Theme. By this time, the Slavs were no longer a threat to the Byzantines since they had been either defeated numerous times or placed in the Sclaviniae. The Slavic communities in Bithynia were destroyed by the Byzantines after General Leontios lost to the Arabs in the Battle of Sebastopolis in 692, as a result of the Slavs having defected to the Arab side.

These themes rebelled against the iconoclast emperor Leo III in 727 and attempted to set up their own emperor, although Leo defeated them. Leo then moved the headquarters of the &quot;Karabisianoi&quot; to Anatolia and created the Cibyrrhaeotic Theme of them. Up to this time, Greece and the Aegean were still technically under the ecclesiastic authority of the Pope, but Leo also quarreled with the Papacy and gave these territories to the Patriarch of Constantinople. As emperor, Leo III, introduced more administrative and legal reforms than had been promulgated since the time of Justinian. Meanwhile, the Arabs began their first serious raids in the Aegean. Bithynia was eventually re-populated by Greek-speaking population from mainland Greece and Cyprus.

==Prosperity and Byzantine victories (8th–11th centuries)==
Nicephorus I also began to reconquer Slavic and Bulgar-held areas in the early 9th century. He resettled Greek-speaking families from Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula and the Balkans, and expanded the theme of Hellas to the north to include parts of Thessaly and Macedonia, and to the south to include the regained territory of the Peloponnese. Thessalonica, previously organized as an archontate surrounded by the Slavs, became a theme of its own as well. These themes contributed another 10,000 men to the army, and allowed Nicephorus to convert most of the Slavs to Christianity.

Crete was conquered by the Arabs in 824. In the late 9th century, Leo VI faced also invasions from the Bulgarians under Simeon I, who pillaged Thrace in 896, and again in 919 during Zoe&#x27;s regency for Constantine VII. Simeon invaded northern Greece again in 922 and penetrated deep to the south seizing Thebes, just north of Athens. Crete was reconquered in 961 from the Arabs, by Nikephoros II Phokas after the Siege of Chandax.

In the late 10th century, the greatest threat to Greece was from Samuel, who constantly fought over the area with Basil II. In 985, Samuel captured Thessaly and the important city of Larissa, and in 989, he pillaged Thessalonica. Basil slowly began to recapture these areas in 991, but Samuel captured the areas around Thessalonica and the Peloponnese again in 997 before being forced to withdraw to Bulgaria. In 999, Samuel captured Dyrrhachium and raided northern Greece once more. Basil recaptured these areas by 1002 and had fully subjugated completely the Bulgarians in the decade before his death (see Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria).

By Basil&#x27;s death in 1025, Greece was divided into &quot;themes&quot; including Crete, the Peloponnese, Thrace, Macedonia, Hellas, Nicopolis, Dyrrhachium, Cephalonia, Thessalonica and Strymon, the Cyclades and the Aegean Sea. They were protected from raids and invasions by the new themes created out of Bulgar territory.

Greece became more prosperous in the 10th century and towns and cities began to grow again. Athens and Corinth probably grew to about 10,000 people, while Thessalonica may have had as many as 100,000 people. There was an important aristocratic class from these themes, especially the Macedonian emperors who ruled the empire from 867 to 1056.

==Fourth Crusade and Latin conquest==

Greece and the empire as a whole faced a new threat from the Normans of Sicily in the late 11th century. Robert Guiscard took Dyrrhachium and Corcyra in 1081 (see Battle of Dyrrhachium), but Alexius I defeated him, and later his son Bohemund, by 1083. The Pechenegs also raided Thrace during this period.

In 1147, while the knights of the Second Crusade made their way through Byzantine territory, Roger II of Sicily captured Corcyra and pillaged Thebes and Corinth.

In 1197, Henry VI of Germany continued his father Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s antagonism towards the empire by threatening to invade Greece to reclaim the territory the Normans had briefly held. Alexius III was forced to pay him off, although the taxes he imposed caused frequent revolts against him, including rebellions in Greece and the Peloponnese. Also during his reign, the Fourth Crusade attempted to place Alexius IV on the throne, until it eventually invaded and sacked the capital.

Greece was relatively peaceful and prosperous in the 11th and 12th centuries, compared to Anatolia which was being overrun by the Seljuks. Thessalonica had probably grown to about 150,000 people, despite being looted by the Normans in 1185. Thebes also became a major city with perhaps 30,000 people, and was the centre of a major silk industry. Athens and Corinth probably still had around 10,000 people. Mainland Greek cities continued to export grain to the capital in order to make up for the land lost to the Seljuks.

However, after Constantinople was conquered during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Greece was divided among the Crusaders. The Latin Empire held Constantinople and Thrace, while the rest of Greece was divided into the Kingdom of Thessalonica, the Principality of Achaea, and the Duchy of Athens. The Venetians controlled the Duchy of the Archipelago in the Aegean, while the Despotate of Epirus was established as one of the three Byzantine Greek successor states.

Michael VIII restored the empire in 1261, having also regained the Kingdom of Thessalonica. By his death in 1282, Michael had taken back the Aegean islands, Thessaly, Epirus, and most of Achaea, including the Crusader fortress of Mystras, which became the seat of a Byzantine despotate. However, Athens and the northern Peloponnese remained in Crusader hands. Charles of Anjou and later his son claimed the throne of the defunct Latin Empire, and threatened Epirus, but were never able to make any progress there.

==Byzantine reconquest and reestablishment==

By the reign of Andronicus III Palaeologus, beginning in 1328, the empire controlled most of Greece, especially the metropolis of Thessalonica, but very little else. Epirus was nominally Byzantine but still occasionally rebelled, until it was fully recovered in 1339. Greece was mostly used as a battleground during the civil war between John V Palaeologus and John VI Cantacuzenus in the 1340s, and at the same time the Serbs and Ottomans began attacking Greece as well. By 1356, another independent despotate was set up in Epirus and Thessaly.

The Peloponnese, usually called Morea in this period, was now almost the centre of the empire, and was certainly the most fertile area. Mystras and Monemvasia were populous and prosperous, even after the Black Plague in the mid-14th century. Mystras rivaled Constantinople in importance. It was a stronghold of Greek Orthodoxy and bitterly opposed attempts by the emperors to unite with the Catholic Church, even though this would have allowed the empire to gain help from the west against the Ottomans.

==Ottoman threat and conquest==
The Ottomans had begun their conquest of the Balkans and Greece in the late 14th century and early 15th century capturing among others Thessaloniki, Ioannina and Thessaly. In 1445, Ottoman-occupied Thessaly was recaptured by the future emperor Constantine XI, at the time despot of Mystras, but there was little he could do against most of the other Ottoman territories. Emperor Constantine XI was defeated and killed in 1453 when the Ottomans finally captured Constantinople. After the fall of Constantinople, the Ottomans also captured Athens by 1458, but left a Byzantine despotate in the Peloponnese until 1460. The Venetians still controlled Crete, Aegean islands and some cities-ports, but otherwise the Ottomans controlled many regions of Greece except the mountains and heavily forested areas.

<text>Lasgo is a Belgian electronic music group. The group formed in 1998 and was composed of Peter Luts, Dave McCullen, and singer Evi Goffin.

Peter Luts confirmed on Belgian radio in 2008 that Goffin was not returning to the group, after choosing to become a full-time mother. Luts announced around the same time that he was looking for a new vocalist for the group. Together with Belgian TV station JIMtv, he organized a televised search (in similar fashion to talent shows like &quot;Idol&quot;) for a new vocalist, eventually choosing Jelle Van Dael as the singer. The group name came from McCullen suggesting something related to the United Kingdom, and creating Lasgo out of Glasgow in Scotland.

Throughout their career, Lasgo have sold more than five million units of their albums &quot;Some Things&quot; and &quot;Far Away&quot;, and the singles from those albums.

Although the group has not officially disbanded, they have not released any material since 2013.

As of 2023, Peter Luts has continued to perform as Lasgo.

In 2024, Nikki Born joined Lasgo as the new vocalist and frontwoman for the group.

==Career==
=== 1999–2004: &quot;Some Things&quot; ===
Lasgo&#x27;s first appearance was on the Holiday Party, one of the biggest out parties in Belgium. The Music Factory recorded the show to produce a video clip. In October, Lasgo also won the best national single award on the Belgian TMF Awards 2001. At the same time, it went gold with 25,000 copies sold.

Lasgo&#x27;s debut single &quot;Something&quot; was released in the summer of 2001 and became a hit all around Europe, charting at #5 in Belgium as well as #4 in the UK Singles Chart. In November 2001, Lasgo released their second single &quot;Alone&quot;. This single was taken from Lasgo&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Some Things&quot;, released on 19 November 2001. The music video for &quot;Alone&quot; was shot in a large office in Berlin, Germany.

Due to Lasgo&#x27;s international appeal, Luts was asked to remix Delerium&#x27;s track &quot;Underwater&quot; for EMI Germany, and also crafted a remix for Aurora&#x27;s song &quot;The Day It Rained Forever&quot; on Positiva Records (UK). During 2002, Lasgo was nominated for several awards: International Dance Club Hit of the Year (with &quot;Something&quot;) and International New Dance Group of the Year at the Danish Dance Awards and Best Trance Act at the Dancestar World Music Awards 2002 (which was won by Ian Van Dahl&#x27;s song &quot;Castles in the Sky&quot;).

In August 2002, &quot;Alone&quot; was released in the UK and charted there at #7. It peaked at #3 in Belgium, making it their highest peaking song by them on the Belgian Charts. The debut album &quot;Some Things&quot; was released in the UK at the same time and peaked at #30 in the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Pray&quot; peaked at #17 in December that year. At around the same time, &quot;Some Things&quot; was released in the United States.

In November 2002, Lasgo won the &quot;Smash Hits&quot; award for Best Dance Act of the Year 2002 in the UK. December 2002 marked the release of the second version of &quot;Some Things&quot; in Belgium. The re-release featured three new songs (&quot;Searching&quot;, &quot;You&quot; and &quot;I Wonder&quot;) along with remixes of their hits.

In February 2003, A&amp;S Productions held a party in Club Carré in Willebroek, Belgium, to celebrate the success of Lasgo and Van Dahl, both in Belgium and abroad.

In 2004 Lasgo wins an EBBA Award. Every year the European Border Breakers Awards (EBBA) recognize the success of ten emerging artists or groups who reached audiences outside their own countries with their first internationally released album in the past year.

=== 2004–2008: &quot;Far Away&quot; ===
The fourth Lasgo single, &quot;Surrender&quot;, was released on vinyl in October 2003. &quot;Surrender&quot; appeared on CD in January 2004 in Belgium. The worldwide release was in February. A remixed UK release by LMC followed in April, where the song reached #24.

In March 2004, Lasgo won their second award (Best Hi-NRG/Euro track with &quot;Alone&quot;) at the Winter Music Conference&#x27;s International Dance Music Awards in Miami, Florida. The year before they won the Best New Dance Artist Group Award. At the MIDEM 2004 music conference in Cannes (France), Lasgo was one of the winners of the European Border Breakers award. This award, given out by the European Commission, wants to enhance the exchange/export of pop music across country borders.

&quot;Surrender&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Chart in late December 2004 and in January 2005. The second single from &quot;Far Away&quot;, was called &quot;All Night Long&quot;. It was released on vinyl in December 2004. &quot;All Night Long&quot; went #1 in Belgium&#x27;s dance club chart. Although it was not as successful as &quot;Surrender,&quot; it did manage to chart in the Dutch Top 40 and was their second biggest hit in the Netherlands. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;, the third single from &quot;Far Away&quot;, was sung by Dave Beyer, not Evi Goffin.

&quot;Lying&quot; was the fourth and last single release from &quot;Far Away&quot;, although it was not issued in the UK. It was a mediocre success, reaching the Top 20 in Belgium.

=== 2008–2009: &quot;Smile&quot; ===
&quot;Out of My Mind&quot; was the first single from the band including Jelle van Dael. Released in 2008, it achieved chart success in the Netherlands and Belgium, making it into the Top 10. It failed to chart in the UK. &quot;Gone&quot; (2009) was the next single with the video shot in Los Angeles. It peaked at #5 Belgium. Then followed &quot;Lost&quot; in August before the album was released the following month. &quot;Over You&quot; became the fourth and final single release from &quot;Smile&quot;.

=== 2010–2013 ===
&quot;Tonight&quot;, the first single from Lasgo&#x27;s upcoming fourth album, was released to moderate success in the act&#x27;s homeland of Belgium. This was then followed by the release of &quot;Here with Me&quot; which became a top 30 hit. The third single, titled &quot;Sky High&quot; was released on 7 May 2012, peaking at #5 on the Ultratip Chart. The fourth single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; was released internationally on 3 October 2012. It peaked at #18 on the Ultratip Chart as well. . Their last single &quot;Feeling Alive,&quot; was released on 2 July 2013 and peaked at #21. On 8 September 2014, on the group&#x27;s official Twitter page, it was announced that the lead singer, Jelle Van Dael, would release a solo single apart from the group. The band have not released any material since July 2013 as vocalist Jelle is focusing on her solo material and Peter is focused on his DJ career.

=== 2024-Present ===
As of February 1, 2024, it was announced by the group a new vocalist, Nikki Born, will be performing vocals on future singles.

<text>The flag of the United Nations is a sky blue banner containing the United Nations&#x27; emblem in the centre. The emblem on the flag is coloured white; it is a depiction of the world map in the azimuthal equidistant projection (centred on the North Pole and the International Date Line), surrounded by a pair of olive branches. The emblem was officially adopted on 7 December 1946, and the flag containing the emblem was officially adopted on 20 October 1947.
==Design==
The flag of the United Nations consists of the white emblem on the sky blue background. The emblem depicts a azimuthal equidistant projection of the world map, centred on the North Pole, with the globe being orientated to the International Date Line. The projection of the map extends to 60 degrees south latitude, and includes five concentric circles. The map is inscribed in a wreath consisting of crossed conventionalized branches of the olive tree.

The size of the emblem on the flag is one half the width of the flag itself. The flag proportions of the aspect ratio of the flag height to its width, are equal 2:3, 3:5 or to the same proportions as the national flag of any country in which the UN flag is flown. White and blue are the official colours of the United Nations. The light blue background colour code is Pantone Matching System 2925. It approximates sky blue.

The olive branches are a symbol for peace, and the world map represents all the people and the countries of the world.

==History==

The organizers of the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, California wanted an insignia that could be made into a pin to identify delegates. United States Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, Jr. was chairperson of the U.S. delegation, and realized that a temporary design might become the permanent symbol of the United Nations. He formed a committee headed by Oliver Lundquist that developed a design consisting of a world map surrounded by leaves from a design created by Donal McLaughlin.

McLaughlin had previously worked as chief of graphics for the Office of Strategic Services that preceded the CIA. The azimuthal equidistant projection used in his design was heavily influenced by the maps created during World War II by Richard Edes Harrison, a popular cartographer working for &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Life.&quot;&quot;&quot;.

The blue that appears in the background of the insignia was chosen to be &quot;the opposite of red, the war colour&quot;, although the exact shade has never been officially specified by the United Nations. The original colour the group chose in 1945 was a gray blue that differs from the current United Nations flag, unofficially called &quot;Stettinius Blue&quot;, and it was selected because at that time it was not in use in any national flag The globe used in the original design was an azimuthal projection focused on the North Pole with the United States, the host nation of the conference, at the centre. The projection that was used cut off portions of the Southern Hemisphere below 40 degrees south latitude, because that&#x27;s where the Rand McNally map used as a model cut off, and the designers did not have time to find another map; this was considered acceptable because Argentina, Chile and New Zealand were not yet planned to be members of the United Nations. The projection was later altered so that the globe was centered on the International Date Line and extend to 60 degrees south. According to official explanations, the change was made to represent countries &quot;as far as possible in their proper relationship to the cardinal points&quot; and &quot;so the east and west were in balance&quot;.

In 1946, a UNO committee was tasked to make a definite design, which was presented 2 December 1946. The emblem was adopted by the plenary session of the UNO on 7 December 1946, and the flag was officially adopted on 20 October 1947.

==Use==
According to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, the emblem and the flag of the United Nations can be used by the personnel and material of UN peacekeeping missions as a protective sign to prevent attacks during an armed conflict.

The United Nations flag may also be flown as a garrison flag with other country flags. Garrison size is 10 feet by 30 feet.

==Derived flags==

===Agencies and organizations===

===National flags===
The UN flag is the origin of a family of national flags. Because of the UN&#x27;s association with peace and cooperation, UN-inspired flags are often adopted by states that have experienced conflict or instability. Many states with UN-inspired flags either were or were a part of United Nations trust territories.
===Subnational flags===
The subnational flags, flags of constituent political entities of some states with UN-inspired flags, states that either were or were a part of United Nations trust territories, sometimes also derive inspiration from the flag of the United Nations.
===Municipal flags===
The municipal flags of constituent political entities of some states with UN-inspired flags, states that either were or were a part of United Nations trust territories, sometimes also derive inspiration from the flag of the United Nations.
=== Usage outside of the United Nations ===
* The UN flag is depicted in the background of former UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld on Sweden&#x27;s 1,000 SEK banknote, the currency&#x27;s highest denomination. The banknotes have been in circulation since October 2015.

<text>The vast majority of the territory of present-day Greece was at some point incorporated within the Ottoman Empire. The period of Ottoman rule in Greece, lasting from the mid-15th century until the successful Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821 and the First Hellenic Republic was proclaimed in 1822, is known in Greece as Turkocracy (, , &quot;Turkish rule&quot;). Some regions, like the Ionian islands and various temporary Venetian possessions of the Stato da Mar, were not incorporated in the Ottoman Empire. The Mani Peninsula in the Peloponnese was not fully integrated into the Ottoman Empire, but was under Ottoman suzerainty.

The Eastern Roman Empire, which ruled most of the Greek-speaking world for over 1100 years, had been fatally weakened since the Fourth Crusade of 1204. Having defeated the Serbs, the Ottomans captured Constantinople in 1453 and soon advanced southwards capturing Athens in 1456 and the Peloponnese in 1460. By the early 16th century, all of mainland Greece and most of the Aegean Islands were in Ottoman hands, excluding several port cities that were still held by the Venetians (notably Nafplio, Monemvasia, Parga and Methone). The mountains of Greece remained largely untouched and were a refuge for Greeks who desired to flee Ottoman rule and engage in guerrilla warfare. The Cyclades islands were annexed by the Ottomans in 1579, although they had been under vassal status since the 1530s. Cyprus fell in 1571, and the Venetians retained Crete until 1669. The Ionian Islands were never ruled by the Ottomans, with the exception of Kefalonia (from 1479 to 1481 and from 1485 to 1500), but remained under the rule of the Venice. It was in the Ionian Islands that modern Greek statehood was born, with the creation of the Republic of the Seven Islands in 1800.

Ottoman Greece was a multiethnic society, although the Ottoman system of &quot;millets&quot; did not correspond to the contemporary notion of multiculturalism. The Greeks were given some privileges and freedom, but they also suffered from the malpractices of its administrative personnel over which the central government had only remote and incomplete control. Despite losing their political independence, the Greeks remained dominant in the fields of commerce and business. The consolidation of Ottoman power in the 15th and the 16th centuries rendered the Mediterranean safe for Greek shipping, and Greek shipowners became the empire&#x27;s maritime carriers and made tremendous profits. After the Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Lepanto, however, Greek ships often became the target of attacks by Catholic (especially Spanish and Maltese) pirates.

The five century period of Ottoman rule had a profound impact in Greek society, as new elites emerged. The Greek land-owning aristocracy that traditionally dominated the Byzantine Empire suffered a tragic fate and was almost completely destroyed. The new leading class in Ottoman Greece were the &quot;prokritoi&quot;, which were called &quot;kocabaşis&quot; by the Ottomans. They were essentially bureaucrats and tax collectors and gained a negative reputation for corruption and nepotism. On the other hand, the Phanariots became prominent in the imperial capital of Constantinople as businessmen and diplomats, and the Greek Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarch rose to great power under the Sultan&#x27;s protection and gained religious control over the entire Orthodox population of the empire, whether it spoke Greek, Albanian, Latin or Slavic.

==Ottoman expansion==

After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Despotate of the Morea was the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against the Ottomans. However, it fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the conquest of mainland Greece.

While most of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands was under Ottoman control by the end of the 15th century, Cyprus and Crete remained Venetian territory and did not fall to the Ottomans until 1571 and 1670. The only part of the Greek-speaking world that was never under Ottoman rule is the Ionian Islands, which remained Venetian until 1797. Corfu withstood three major sieges in 1537, 1571 and 1716 all of which resulted in the repulsion of the Ottomans.

Other areas that remained part of the Venetian Stato da Màr include Nafplio and Monemvasia until 1540, the Duchy of the Archipelago, centered on the islands of Naxos and Paros until 1579, Sifnos until 1617 and Tinos until 1715.

==Ottoman rule==
The consolidation of Ottoman rule was followed by two distinct trends of Greek migration. The first entailed Greek intellectuals, such as Basilios Bessarion, Georgius Plethon Gemistos and Marcos Mousouros, migrating to other parts of Western Europe and influencing the advent of the Renaissance (though the large scale migration of Greeks to other parts of Europe, most notably Italian university cities, began far earlier, following the Crusader capture of Constantinople). This trend had also effect on the creation of the modern Greek diaspora.

The second entailed Greeks leaving the plains of the Greek peninsula and resettling in the mountains, where the rugged landscape made it hard for the Ottomans to establish either military or administrative presence.

===Administration===

The Sultan sat at the apex of the government of the Ottoman Empire. Although he had the trappings of an absolute ruler, he was actually bound by tradition and convention. Ottoman rule of the provinces was characterized by two main functions. The local administrators within the provinces were to maintain a military establishment and to collect taxes. The military establishment was feudal in character. The Sultan&#x27;s cavalry were allotted land, either large allotments or small allotments based on the rank of the individual cavalryman. All non-Muslims were forbidden to ride a horse which made traveling more difficult. The Ottomans divided Greece into six &quot;sanjaks&quot;, each ruled by a &quot;Sanjakbey&quot; accountable to the Sultan, who established his capital in Constantinople in 1453.


The conquered land was parceled out to Ottoman warriors, who held it as feudal fiefs (&quot;timars&quot; and &quot;ziamets&quot;) directly under the Sultan&#x27;s authority. This land could not be sold or inherited, but reverted to the Sultan&#x27;s possession when the fief-holder (timariot) died. During their life-times they served as cavalrymen in the Sultan&#x27;s army, living well on the proceeds of their estates with the land being tilled largely by peasants. Many Ottoman timariots were descended from the pre-Ottoman Christian nobility, and shifted their allegiance to the Ottomans following the conquest of the Balkans. Conversion to Islam was not a requirement, and as late as the fifteenth century many timariots were known to be Christian, although their numbers gradually decreased over time.

The Ottomans basically installed this feudal system right over the top of the existing system of peasant tenure. The peasantry remained in possession of their own land and their tenure over their plot of land remained hereditary and inalienable. Nor was any military service ever imposed on the peasant by the Ottoman government. All non-Muslims were in theory forbidden from carrying arms, but this was ignored. Indeed, in regions such as Crete, almost every man carried arms.

Greek Christian families were, however, subject to a system of child conscription known as the devshirme. The Ottomans required that selected male children from Christian peasant villages be conscripted and enrolled in the corps of Janissaries for military training in the Sultan&#x27;s army. Others were trained as the intelligentsia and imperial administrators. Such recruitment was sporadic, and the proportion of children conscripted varied from region to region. The practice largely came to an end by the middle of the seventeenth century.

Under the Ottoman system of government, Greek society was at the same time fostered and restricted. With one hand the Ottoman regime gave privileges and freedom to its subject people; with the other it imposed a tyranny deriving from the malpractices of its administrative personnel over which it exercised only remote and incomplete control. In fact the &quot;rayahs&quot; were commoners. The term rayah came to denote an underprivileged, tax-ridden and socially inferior population.

===Religion===
The Sultan regarded the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church as the leader of all Orthodox, Greeks or not, within the empire. The Patriarch was accountable to the Sultan for the good behavior of the Orthodox population, and in exchange he was given wide powers over the Orthodox communities, including the non-Greek Slavic peoples. The Patriarch controlled the courts and the schools, as well as the Church, throughout the Greek communities of the empire. This made Orthodox priests, together with the local magnates, called Prokritoi or Dimogerontes, the effective rulers of Greek towns and cities. Some Greek towns, such as Athens and Rhodes, retained municipal self-government, while others were put under Ottoman governors. Several areas, such as the Mani Peninsula in the Peloponnese, and parts of Crete (Sfakia) and Epirus, remained virtually independent.

The Patriarchate of Constantinople in general remained loyal to the Ottomans against the western threats (as for example during the Dionysios Skylosophos revolt, etc.) The Orthodox Church assisted greatly in the preservation of the Greek heritage, and adherence to the Greek Orthodox faith became increasingly a mark of Greek nationality.

As a rule, the Ottomans did not require the Greeks to become Muslims, although many did so on a superficial level in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule or because of the alleged corruption of the Greek clergy. The regions of Greece which had the largest concentrations of Ottoman Greek Muslims were Macedonia, notably the Vallaades, neighboring Epirus, and Crete (see Cretan Muslims). Under the millet logic, Greek Muslims, despite often retaining elements of their Greek culture and language, were classified simply as &quot;Muslim&quot;, although most Greek Orthodox Christians deemed them to have &quot;turned-Turk&quot; and therefore saw them as traitors to their original ethno-religious communities.

Some Greeks either became New Martyrs, such as Saint Efraim the Neo-Martyr or Saint Demetrios the Neo-martyr while others became Crypto-Christians (Greek Muslims who were secret practitioners of the Greek Orthodox faith) in order to avoid heavy taxes and at the same time express their identity by maintaining their secret ties to the Greek Orthodox Church. Crypto-Christians officially ran the risk of being killed if they were caught practicing a non-Muslim religion once they converted to Islam. There were also instances of Greeks from theocratic or Byzantine nobility embracing Islam such as John Tzelepes Komnenos and Misac Palaeologos Pasha.

Treatment of Christian subjects varied greatly under the rule of the Ottoman Sultans. Bayezid I, according to a Byzantine historian, freely admitted Christians into his society while trying to grow his empire, in the early Ottoman period. Later, although the Turkish ruler attempted to pacify the local population with a restoration of peacetime rule of law, the Christian population also became subject to special taxes and the tribute of Christian children to the Ottoman state to feed the ranks of the Janissary corps. Violent persecutions of Christians did nevertheless take place under the reign of Selim I (1512-1520), known as Selim the Grim, who attempted to stamp out Christianity from the Ottoman Empire. Selim ordered the confiscation of all Christian churches, and while this order was later rescinded, Christians were heavily persecuted during his era.

===Taxation and the &quot;tribute of children&quot;===
Greeks paid a land tax and a heavy tax on trade, the latter taking advantage of the wealthy Greeks to fill the state coffers. Greeks, like other Christians, were also made to pay the &quot;jizya&quot;, or Islamic poll-tax which all non-Muslims in the empire were forced to pay instead of the Zakat that Muslims must pay as part of the 5 pillars of Islam. Failure to pay the jizya could result in the pledge of protection of the Christian&#x27;s life and property becoming void, facing the alternatives of conversion, enslavement, or death.

Like in the rest of the Ottoman Empire, Greeks had to carry a receipt certifying their payment of jizya at all times or be subject to imprisonment. Most Greeks did not have to serve in the Sultan&#x27;s army, but the young boys that were taken away and converted to Islam were made to serve in the Ottoman military. In addition, girls were taken in order to serve as odalisques in harems.

These practices are called the &quot;tribute of children&quot; (&quot;devshirmeh&quot;) (in Greek &quot;παιδομάζωμα&quot; &quot;paidomazoma&quot;, meaning &quot;child gathering&quot;), whereby every Christian community was required to give one son in five to be raised as a Muslim and enrolled in the corps of Janissaries, elite units of the Ottoman army. There was much resistance to this. For example, Greek folklore tells of mothers crippling their sons to avoid their abduction. Nevertheless, entrance into the corps (accompanied by conversion to Islam) offered Greek boys the opportunity to advance as high as governor or even Grand Vizier.

Opposition of the Greek populace to taxing or &quot;paidomazoma&quot; resulted in grave consequences. For example, in 1705 an Ottoman official was sent from Naoussa in Macedonia to search and conscript new Janissaries and was killed by Greek rebels who resisted the burden of the devshirmeh. The rebels were subsequently beheaded and their severed heads were displayed in the city of Thessaloniki. In some cases, it was greatly feared as Greek families would often have to relinquish their own sons who would convert and return later as their oppressors. In other cases, the families bribed the officers to ensure that their children got a better life as a government officer.

===Influence on tradition===

After the 16th century, many Greek folk songs (&quot;dimotika&quot;) were produced and inspired from the way of life of the Greek people, brigands and the armed conflicts during the centuries of Ottoman rule. Klephtic songs (Greek: Κλέφτικα τραγούδια), or ballads, are a subgenre of the Greek folk music genre and are thematically oriented on the life of the klephts. Prominent conflicts were immortalised in several folk tales and songs, such as the epic ballad &quot;To tragoudi tou Daskalogianni&quot; of 1786, about the resistance warfare under Daskalogiannis.

==Emergence of Greek nationalism==


Over the course of the eighteenth century Ottoman landholdings, previously fiefs held directly from the Sultan, became hereditary estates (&quot;chifliks&quot;), which could be sold or bequeathed to heirs. The new class of Ottoman landlords reduced the hitherto free Greek peasants to serfdom, leading to further poverty and depopulation in the plains.

On the other hand, the position of educated and privileged Greeks within the Ottoman Empire improved greatly in the 17th and 18th centuries. From the late 1600s Greeks began to fill some of the highest and most important offices of the Ottoman state. The Phanariotes, a class of wealthy Greeks who lived in the Phanar district of Constantinople, became increasingly powerful. Their travels to Western Europe as merchants or diplomats brought them into contact with advanced ideas of liberalism and nationalism, and it was among the Phanariotes that the modern Greek nationalist movement was born. Many Greek merchants and travelers were influenced by the ideas of the French Revolution and a new Age of Greek Enlightenment was initiated at the beginning of the 19th century in many Ottoman-ruled Greek cities and towns.

Greek nationalism was also stimulated by agents of Catherine the Great, the Orthodox ruler of the Russian Empire, who hoped to acquire Ottoman territory, including Constantinople itself, by inciting a Christian rebellion against the Ottomans. However, during the Russian-Ottoman War which broke out in 1768, the Greeks did not rebel, disillusioning their Russian patrons. The Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji (1774) gave Russia the right to make &quot;representations&quot; to the Sultan in defense of his Orthodox subjects, and the Russians began to interfere regularly in the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire. This, combined with the new ideas let loose by the French Revolution of 1789, began to reconnect the Greeks with the outside world and led to the development of an active nationalist movement, one of the most progressive of the time.

Greece was peripherally involved in the Napoleonic Wars, but one episode had important consequences. When the French under Napoleon Bonaparte seized Venice in 1797, they also acquired the Ionian Islands, thus ending the four hundredth year of Venetian rule over the Ionian Islands. The islands were elevated to the status of a French dependency called the Septinsular Republic, which possessed local autonomy. This was the first time Greeks had governed themselves since the fall of Trebizond in 1461.

Among those who held office in the islands was John Capodistria, destined to become independent Greece&#x27;s first head of state. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Greece had re-emerged from its centuries of isolation. British and French writers and artists began to visit the country, and wealthy Europeans began to collect Greek antiquities. These &quot;philhellenes&quot; were to play an important role in mobilizing support for Greek independence.

===Uprisings before 1821===

Greeks in various places of the Greek peninsula would at times rise up against Ottoman rule, mainly while taking advantage of wars the Ottoman Empire would engage in. Those uprisings were of mixed scale and impact. During the Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479), the Maniot Kladas brothers, Krokodelos and Epifani, were leading bands of stratioti on behalf of Venice against the Turks in Southern Peloponnese. They put Vardounia and their lands into Venetian possession, for which Epifani then acted as governor.

Before and after the victory of the Holy League in 1571 at the Battle of Lepanto a series of conflicts broke out in the peninsula such as in Epirus, Phocis (recorded in the &quot;Chronicle of Galaxeidi&quot;) and the Peloponnese, led by the Melissinos brothers and others. They were crushed by the following year. Short-term revolts of local level occurred throughout the region such as the ones led by metropolitan bishop Dionysius the Philosopher in Thessaly (1600) and Epirus (1611).

During the Cretan War (1645–1669), the Maniots would aid Francesco Morosini and the Venetians in the Peloponnese. Greek irregulars also aided the Venetians through the Morean War in their operations on the Ionian Sea and Peloponnese.

A major uprising during that period was the Orlov Revolt (Greek: Ορλωφικά) which took place during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) and triggered armed unrest in both the Greek mainland and the islands. In 1778, a Greek fleet of seventy vessels assembled by Lambros Katsonis which harassed the Turkish squadrons in the Aegean Sea, captured the island of Kastelorizo and engaged the Turkish fleet in naval battles until 1790.

===Greek War of Independence===

A secret Greek nationalist organization called the &quot;Friendly Society&quot; or &quot;Company of Friends&quot; (&quot;Filiki Eteria&quot;) was formed in Odessa in 1814. The members of the organization planned a rebellion with the support of wealthy Greek exile communities in Britain and the United States. They also gained support from sympathizers in Western Europe, as well as covert assistance from Russia. The organization secured Capodistria, who became Russian Foreign Minister after leaving the Ionian Islands, as the leader of the planned revolt. On March 25 (now Greek Independence Day) 1821, the Orthodox Bishop Germanos of Patras proclaimed a national uprising. The Ottomans, in retaliation orchestrated the Constantinople massacre of 1821 and similar pogroms in Smyrna.

Simultaneous risings were planned across Greece, including in Macedonia, Crete, and Cyprus. With the initial advantage of surprise, aided by Ottoman inefficiency and the Ottomans&#x27; fight against Ali Pasha of Tepelen, the Greeks succeeded in capturing the Peloponnese and some other areas. Some of the first Greek actions were taken against unarmed Ottoman settlements, with about 40% of Turkish and Albanian Muslim residents of the Peloponnese killed outright, and the rest fleeing the area or being deported.

The Ottomans recovered, and retaliated in turn with savagery, massacring the Greek population of Chios and other towns. This worked to their disadvantage by provoking further sympathy for the Greeks in Britain and France. The Greeks were unable to establish a strong government in the areas they controlled, and fell to fighting amongst themselves. Inconclusive fighting between Greeks and Ottomans continued until 1825 when the Sultan sent a powerful fleet and army who were mainly Bedouin and some Sudanese from Egypt under Ibrahim Pasha to suppress the revolution, promising to him the rule of Peloponnese, however they were eventually defeated in the Battle of Navarino in 1827.

The atrocities that accompanied this expedition, together with sympathy aroused by the death of the poet and leading philhellene Lord Byron at Messolongi in 1824, eventually led the Great Powers to intervene. In October 1827, the British, French and Russian fleets, on the initiative of local commanders, but with the tacit approval of their governments, destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino. This was the decisive moment in the war of independence.

In October 1828, the French landed troops in the Peloponnese to evacuate it from Ibrahim&#x27;s army, while Russia was since April at war against the Ottomans. Under their protection, the Greeks were able to reorganize, form a new government and defeat the Ottomans in the Battle of Petra, the final battle of the war. They then advanced to seize as much territory as possible before the Western powers imposed a ceasefire.

A conference in London in 1830 proposed a fully independent Greek state (and not autonomous as previously proposed). The final borders were defined during the London Conference of 1832 with the northern frontier running from Arta to Volos, and including only Euboia and the Cyclades among the islands. The Greeks were disappointed at these restricted frontiers, but were in no position to resist the will of Britain, France and Russia, who had contributed mightily to Greek independence. By the Convention of May 11, 1832, Greece was finally recognized as a sovereign state.

Capodistria, who had been Greece&#x27;s governor since 1828, had been assassinated by the Mavromichalis family in October 1831. To prevent further experiments with republican government, the Great Powers, especially Russia, insisted that Greece should be a monarchy, and the Bavarian Prince Otto was chosen to be its first King.

<text>Héctor Marcano (born November 3, 1956) is a Puerto Rican producer, host, actor, and comedian. Marcano is also an owner of low-power television station WWXY-LD Channel 17.

Hector Marcano currently serves as Vice President of Hispanic Operations East, for iHeartMedia. Marcano works with iHeartMedia&#x27;s Hispanic radio stations, with a special focus in the Miami, Chicago, Orlando, and Atlanta markets.

==Early years==
Héctor Marcano was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico.

==Career==
Marcano&#x27;s career took off after Luis Vigoreaux&#x27;s death. He started hosting &quot;A Millón&quot;, a Puerto Rican game show, along with Sonia Noemí and Rafael José. The show was rated the number one television game show for several years.

In 1987, alongside &quot;El Gangster&quot; Marcano performed as host of Super Siete&#x27;s &quot;La Hora de Oro&quot;. In the same year, Marcano had a highly publicized wedding to Ivette Rivera-Lisojo. The wedding was shown live on Puerto Rican television. Vea, a local show biz magazine, produced a &quot;wedding album&quot; about the event.

In 1990, Marcano moved to Telemundo to start a new show &quot;Marcano... el show&quot;. The show was both popular and controversial, being accused of being a copycat of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;.

In 1996, Marcano moved to WAPA-TV and produced a new game show called Vale Más, and in 1998, another show called &quot;El Super Show&quot;.

In 2000, he moved to Tele-Once but continued with &quot;El Super Show&quot; for a while. Later in 2000 Marcano created &quot;Que Suerte que es Domingo&quot;. This show underwent two title changes: &quot;Que Suerte Tienes Tú&quot;, and in 2002, &quot;Que Suerte&quot;, his longest running show, and top in the ratings consequently, broadcast by Univision. It was broadcast in Puerto Rico and in the Miami, New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas via their respective Univision affiliates. In 2011, the show moved to Telemundo and was renamed &quot;Factor Suerte&quot;.

In 2016, Marcano was appointed to the Board of Directors of Viva Entertainment Group, Inc.

On May 25, 2020, Marcano returns to the Puerto Rican television airwaves, hosting the new talk show, titled &quot;MegaNoche&quot; which will broadcast from his home in Orlando and will be air live from Puerto Rico on Mega TV-owned station WTCV at 7:00 pm on weekdays.

<text>Robert Emil Schmidt (November 27, 1917 – July 30, 1998), nicknamed Buffalo Bob, was an American radio and television personality and presenter; he was well known as the host of the children&#x27;s show &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and radio===
Smith was born in Buffalo, New York, as Robert Emil Schmidt. He attended Masten Park High School. 

Schmidt got his start in radio in Buffalo at WGR (AM), though he switched from WGR to WBEN&#x27;s late morning radio slot in 1943 as part of a move which brought Clint Buehlman&#x27;s popular early morning show from WGR to WBEN at the same time. (The WBEN morning slot had opened when its host, future NBC-TV personality Jack Paar, was drafted into the military.) 

WBEN was seeking to break WGR&#x27;s #1 position in local popularity; shaking the position of network-fed &quot;Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club&quot; and its grip on ratings for the 9 a.m. time slot was an important part of the plan. WBEN first poached Clint Buehlman&#x27;s morning show, which ended at 9 a.m., followed by 15 minutes of local news. Then Buffalo Bob appeared at 9:15 a.m. Eventually, Smith won the #1 spot in late mornings for WBEN, and McNeill dropped to second in the Buffalo market. Smith&#x27;s popularity in Buffalo earned the attention of NBC, which brought him to New York after the war to host early mornings on flagship station WNBC. He held this post through the early 1950s before concentrating on television. For a time between 1947 and 1953, he appeared mornings on WNBC while hosting and producing the daily &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; show.

==The &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; show==
Smith first performed the character on his WNBC radio show. When the show transitioned to TV (1947–1960), puppet builder Frank Paris created a marionette to match the voice. In 1948, a dispute over merchandising rights led Frank Paris to leave the show and take the original puppet with him. Velma Dawson created this new style of Howdy Doody puppet that debuted on June 8, 1948 after a break for “plastic surgery.” Throughout the series run on NBC, Bob Smith voiced the puppet, usually through recordings made before the show, while Margo and Rufus Rose were primarily responsible for building, maintaining, and performing the marionettes. Smith was also known as a singer and musician, appearing on many top shows of the time both before and after becoming nationally known for the &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; show. In 1954, Smith suffered a heart attack and as a result, performed the show from a studio built in the basement of his home in New Rochelle, New York. He returned to the NBC studio in 1955. The final NBC &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; episode aired in 1960. Later, in 1976, Smith reunited with longtime show producer E. Roger Muir and several of the original cast to produce a new daily syndicated &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; show.

David Marc describes a show:
: Smith who built it into an enduring hit and one of television&#x27;s first profitable franchises for licensed product tie-ins...Whereas other 1950s children&#x27;s series were appreciated by adults for their tender wit—such as Burr Tillstrom&#x27;s puppet show &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot;—or were presented for educational value—such as &quot;Ask Mr. Wizard&quot;, a science show—the Howdy Doody Show was strictly aimed at pleasing children, which it did to dizzying excess. With an audience of screaming kids filling the “Peanut Gallery” onstage to energize the millions watching at home, Buffalo Bob in cowboy buckskins opened each show by shouting out the signature question, “Hey kids, what time is it?” The verbal response by the audience, “It&#x27;s Howdy Doody Time!” cued a rousing theme song, which inspired salty parodies in schoolyards across the country. The energy and decibel levels of the show were kept high throughout. When not taking a pratfall—sometimes on an actual banana peel—Smith was the target of Clarabell&#x27;s high-pressure seltzer bottle. The show was particularly effective in its relentless use of words and nonsense syllables designed to drive children giddy with laughter. Flub-a-Dub, for instance, was a fantasy animal character which could survive only by eating meatballs. Such songs as “Ooga Booga Rocka Shmooga” and “Iggly Wiggly Spaghetti” sent the Peanut Gallery into paroxysms of laughter.

==After Howdy Doody==
In 1970 and 1971, Smith embarked on a live tour of college campuses. The shows, organized by producer Burt DuBrow, mixed nostalgia with more contemporary humor, such as Buffalo Bob finding a package of Zig Zags (rolling paper) allegedly belonging to Clarabell. One show, on April 4, 1971, was recorded and released as an LP, on the Project 3 Total Sound Stereo label. It was titled &quot;Buffalo Bob Smith Live at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore East&quot;. 

Smith had a summer residence in Grand Lake Stream, Maine. He was well-liked by locals and occasionally hosted local events. He owned radio stations WQDY in Calais, Maine, WMKR (now WSYY) in Millinocket, Maine and WHOU in Houlton, Maine.

==Later life==
His other screen efforts include films &quot;Track of Thunder&quot; (1968) and &quot;Problem Child 2&quot; (1991), as Father Flanagan. He also made guest appearances on &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, as well as the TV specials &quot;NBC&#x27;s 60th Anniversary Celebration&quot; (1986) and &quot;It&#x27;s Howdy Doody Time&quot; (1987). After his retirement, Smith moved to Henderson County, North Carolina, becoming a member of the Pinecrest Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (ARP) in Flat Rock.

==Death==
On July 3, 1998, Smith made a live infomercial on QVC to promote Howdy Doody Entertainment Memorabilia; this was his last public appearance. Smith died of cancer four weeks later on July 30 in a hospital in Hendersonville, North Carolina, three days before puppeteer Shari Lewis, whose show coincidentally had taken over the time slot which &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; had previously occupied.

<doc id="565634" wikidata="Q1109325" url="?curid=565634" title="Dotted note">
<text>In Western musical notation, a dotted note is a note with a small dot written after it. In modern practice, the first dot increases the duration of the basic note by half (the original note with an extra beam) of its original value. This means that a dotted note is equivalent to writing the basic note tied to a note of half the value – for instance, a dotted half note is equivalent to a half note tied to a quarter note. Subsequent dots add progressively halved value, as shown in the example to the right.

The use of dotted notes dates back at least to the 10th century, but the exact amount of lengthening a dot provides in early music contexts may vary. Mensural notation uses a dot of division to clarify ambiguities about its context-dependent interpretation of rhythmic values, sometimes alongside the dot of [[augmentation (music)|augmentation]] as described above. In the gregorian chant editions of Solesmes, a dot is typically interpreted as a doubling of length (see also Neume).

A pattern using longer notes alternating with shorter notes is sometimes called a dotted rhythm, whether or not it is written as such. Historical examples of music performance practices using unequal rhythms include &quot;notes inégales&quot; and swing. The precise performance of dotted rhythms can be a complex issue. Even in notation that employs dots, their performed values may be longer or shorter than the dot mathematically indicates, practices known as over-dotting or under-dotting.

==Notation==
If the note to be dotted is on a space, the dot also goes on the space, while if the note is on a line, the dot goes on the space above (this also goes for notes on ledger lines).

:&lt;score sound&gt; {
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 4/4
 c4. d8 b8. a16 g4
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The placement of dots gets more complicated for adjacent-note chords and for lower voices, as shown below.

:&lt;score sound&gt; {
 « \clef treble
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 4/4
 \stemNeutral 4. e8 &lt;g, a b c d&gt;4. b8
 \stemUp d4. c8 b8. c16 d c8.
 } \\ \relative c&quot; {
 s1
 g4. a8 b8. a16 g a8.
 »
&lt;/score&gt;

The dots on dotted notes, which are located to the right of the note, should not be confused with the dots for staccato articulation, which are located above or below the note.

Theoretically, any note value can be dotted, as can rests of any value. If the rest is in its normal position, dots are always placed in third staff space from the bottom, as shown in the example below. The dotted rests are very common in simple meters, but also necessary in compound ones, as shown in the example below.

:&lt;score&gt; {
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 6/8
 r2. r4. r8. r8.
}
&lt;/score&gt;

In Baroque music, dotted notation was sometimes used to indicate triplet rhythms when it seemed obvious.

Dots can be used across barlines, such as in H. C. Robbins Landon&#x27;s edition of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 70 in D major, but most writers today regard this usage as obsolete and recommend using a tie across the barline instead.

==Double dotting==

A double-dotted note is a note with two small dots written after it. Its duration is times its basic note value. The double-dotted note is used less frequently than the dotted note. Typically, as in the example to the right, it is followed by a note whose duration is one-quarter the length of the basic note value, completing the next higher note value. Before the mid-18th century, double dots were not used. Until then, in some circumstances, single dots could mean double dots.

In a French overture (and sometimes other Baroque music), notes written as dotted notes are often interpreted to mean double-dotted notes, and the following note is commensurately shortened; see Historically informed performance.

==Triple dotting or beyond==
A triple-dotted note is a note with three dots written after it; its duration is times its basic note value. Use of a triple-dotted note value is not common in the Baroque and Classical periods, but quite common in the music of Richard Wagner and Anton Bruckner, especially in their brass parts.

An example of the use of double- and triple-dotted notes is in Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Prelude in G major for piano, Op. 28, No. 3. The piece, in common time (), contains running semiquavers (sixteenth notes) in the left hand. Several times during the piece Chopin asks for the right hand to play a triple-dotted minim (half note), lasting 15 semiquavers, simultaneously with the first left-hand semiquaver, then one semiquaver simultaneously with the 16th left-hand semiquaver.

Though theoretically possible, a note with more than three dots is highly uncommon; only quadruple dots have been attested. If the original note is considered as being of length 1, then a quintuple dot would only be 1/32 longer than the quadruple dotted note. The difficulty may be seen by comparing dotted notation to tied notation: a quarter note () is equivalent to 2 tied eighth notes (), a dotted quarter = 3 tied eighth notes, double dotted = 7 tied sixteenth notes (), triple dotted = 15 tied thirty-second notes (), and quadruple dotted = 31 tied sixty-fourth notes (). Although shorter notes do occur, sixty-fourth notes are considered the shortest practical duration found in musical notation.

==Other contexts==
The journalist and editor of &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, Frederick George Edwards, used the pseudonym &quot;Dotted Crochet&quot;. Under this name he wrote &quot;educationally suggestive interviews with musical celebrities&quot;, as well as articles about &quot;cathedrals, churches, and educational institutions&quot;.

<text>Hawkesbury is a town in the United Counties of Prescott and Russell in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Hawkesbury is the third most bilingual town in Ontario, with about 70% of its inhabitants being fluent in English and French. Franco-Ontarians make up 89% of the population.

The Long-Sault Bridge links it to Grenville, Quebec to the north. This bridge, crossing Chenail Island, is the only interprovincial bridge between Ontario and Quebec east of Ottawa. The town is located 95 km (59 mi) from Ottawa, and is considered to be midway between Ottawa and Montreal.

==Etymology==
The name Hawkesbury derives from a combination of Hawks, a family name, and bury, a transformation of berry (castle).

==History==
Founded in 1798, Hawkesbury was named after the Right Honourable Charles Jenkinson, Baron Hawkesbury.

Thomas Mears and David Pattee, two Americans, entered into a partnership in 1805, in order to harness the power of the lower Ottawa River and built the first sawmill on the Upper Canada side of the river. The town of Hawkesbury developed around this mill. Mears also built the Union, the Ottawa River&#x27;s first steamer. Demand for timber during the Napoleonic Wars created a boom. The mill complex continued to grow for at least the next half century, and by 1870 it included 145 different saws and created over 35 million board feet of lumber per year.

Timber and pulp-and-paper industries have been supplanted by textiles, synthetic fibres, metal extrusions, steel, glass and plastics. Hawkesbury has also become the business and service centre of the United Counties of Prescott and Russell. The Grenville Canal on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River opposite Hawkesbury was an important link in the river&#x27;s transportation system.

Part of Hawkesbury was submerged by the Carillon Hydro-Québec dam built between 1950 and 1962, which called for the demolition of over 300 houses in and around Hawkesbury. New developments today are happening due to baby boomers from Ottawa, Montreal and area purchasing some of the many new condos in town.

<doc id="565653" wikidata="Q1113494" url="?curid=565653" title="Gold panning">
<text>Gold panning, or simply &quot;panning&quot;, is a form of placer mining and traditional mining that extracts gold from a placer deposit using a pan. The process is one of the simplest ways to extract gold, and is popular with geology enthusiasts especially because of its low cost and relative simplicity.

The first recorded instances of placer mining are from ancient Rome, where gold and other precious metals were extracted from streams and mountainsides using sluices and panning ().

However, the productivity rate is comparatively smaller compared to other methods such as the rocker box or large extractors, such as those used at the Super Pit gold mine, in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, which has led to panning being largely replaced in the commercial market.

==Process==

Gold panning is a simple process. Once a suitable placer deposit is located, some alluvial deposits are scooped into a pan, where they are then wetted and loosed from attached soils by soaking, fingering, and aggressive agitation in water. This is called stratification; which helps dense materials, like gold, sink to the bottom of the pan. Materials with low specific gravity will rise upward, allowing these to be washed out of the pan, whereas materials with higher specific gravity, sinking to the bottom of the sediment during stratification, will remain in the pan allowing examination and collection by the prospector. These dense materials usually consist of black sand with whatever stones or dense metal particles that may be found in the deposit that is used for source material. 

Because of the stratification process, gold panning is used in the assaying process in which portions of paydirt (processed mining material) is analyzed for the amount of gold contained (parts per ton). Assaying is an important aspect of mining, especially for large commercial mining operations. Although gold panning is considered by many an outdoor hobby, it is still a source of income for many who live in parts of Alaska.

While an effective method with certain kinds of deposits, and essential for prospecting, even skilled panners can only work a limited amount of material, significantly less than the other methods which have replaced it in larger operation. Pans remain in use in places where there is limited capital or infrastructure, as well as in recreational gold mining. In many situations, gold panning typically turns up fine gold dust. Nuggets and considerable amounts of dust are occasionally found. Panning for gold can be used to locate the parent gold veins which are the source of most placer deposits.

==Pans==
Gold pans of various designs have been developed over the years, the common features being a means for trapping the heavy materials during agitation, or for easily removing them at the end of the process. Some are intended for use with mercury, include screens, sharp corners for breaking ice, are non-round, or are even designed for use &quot;with or without water&quot;.
Edward Otho Cresap Ord, II, a former Army officer and co-owner of several mines, patented several pan designs including designs for use with mercury or dry.

Pans are measured by their diameter in inches or centimeters. Common sizes of gold pans today range between , with being the most used size. The sides are generally angled between 30° and 45°.

Pans are manufactured in both metal and high-impact plastic. Russia iron or heavy gauge steel pans are traditionally used. Steel pans are heavier and stronger than plastic pans. Some are made of lightweight alloys for structural stability. Plastic gold pans resist rust, acid and corrosion, and most are designed with moulded riffles along one side of the pan. Of the plastic gold pans, green and red ones are usually preferred among prospectors, as both the gold and the black sand stands out in the bottom of the pan, although many also opt for black pans instead to easily identify gold deposits.

The &quot;batea&quot;, Spanish for &quot;gold pan&quot;, is a particular variant of gold pan. Traditionally made of a solid piece of wood, it may also be made of metal. Bateas are used in areas where there is less water available for use than with traditional gold pans, such as Mexico and South America, where it was introduced by the Spanish. Bateas are larger than other gold pans, being closer to half a meter (20 inches) in diameter.

===Yuri-ita===
The yuri-ita (揺り板), Japanese for &quot;rocking plate&quot; is a traditional wooden gold pan used in Japan. Unlike other gold pans, it is rectangular in shape with a concave cross section and is sealed off at one end with the other end open. As the Japanese name implies, the gold is panned with a rocking motion.

<doc id="565655" wikidata="Q2339972" url="?curid=565655" title="Hundred twenty-eighth note">
<text>In music, a hundred twenty-eighth note (North American) or semihemidemisemiquaver or quasihemidemisemiquaver (British) is a note played for of the duration of a whole note. It lasts half as long as a sixty-fourth note. It has a total of five flags or beams.

A single 128th note is always stemmed with flags, while two or more are usually beamed in groups. Notes this short are very rare in printed music, but not unknown. One reason that notes with many beams are rare is that, for instance, a thirty-second note at = 50 lasts the same amount of time as a sixteenth note at = 100; every note in a piece may be notated as twice as long but last the same amount of time if the tempo is also doubled. They are principally used for brief, rapid sections in slow movements. For example, they occur in the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pathétique&quot; Piano Sonata (Op. 13), to notate rapid scales. Another example is in Mozart&#x27;s Variations on &quot;Je suis Lindor&quot;, where many of them are used in the slow twelfth variation. Likewise, 128th notes are used in the explicitly notated ornamental runs in the opening &quot;Adagio&quot; of Bach&#x27;s g minor Sonata for Unaccompanied Violin (BWV 1001).

These five-beamed notes also appear occasionally where a passage is to be performed rapidly, but where the actual tempo is at the discretion of the performer rather than being a strict division of the beat. In such cases, the aggregate time of the notes may not add up exactly to a full measure, and the phrase may be marked with an odd time division to indicate this. Sometimes such notation is made using smaller notes, sized like grace notes. One rare instance where such five-beamed notes occur as acciaccaturas occurs in the final measures of No. 2 of Charles-Valentin Alkan&#x27;s &quot;Trois grandes études&quot;, Op. 76.

Hundred twenty-eighth [[rest (music)|rests]] are also rare, but again not unknown. One is used in Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 13 &quot;Quasi una fantasia&quot; (bar 24 in the adagio movement) where it is followed by an ascending run of 128th notes, as well as in the finale of Charles-Valentin Alkan&#x27;s Grande sonate &#x27;Les quatre âges&#x27;.

<doc id="565664" wikidata="Q707935" url="?curid=565664" title="Buddy Rogers (wrestler)">
<text>Buddy Rogers (born Herman Gustav Rohde Jr.; February 20, 1921 – June 26, 1992), better known by the ring name &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Buddy Rogers, was an American professional wrestler who was one of the biggest professional wrestling stars in the beginning of the television era. His performances influenced future professional wrestlers, including &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Ric Flair, who used Rogers&#x27;s nickname, as well as his look, attitude and finishing hold, the figure-four leglock. He was also known for his rivalry with Lou Thesz, both in and out of the ring.

Rogers was a fourteen-time world champion, notably holding the top championship in both the NWA and the WWWF, today known as WWE (he was the inaugural WWWF World Heavyweight Champion). He is one of four men in history to have held both championships, along with Ric Flair, AJ Styles and Cody Rhodes.

== Early life ==
Rogers was the son of Herman Gustav Rohde Sr., and Frieda Stech, both German immigrants. He was athletic, and took up wrestling at age nine at the local YMCA, joining the Camden YMCA Wrestling League and winning its heavyweight championship. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Rogers also excelled in football, boxing, track and swimming, winning the YMCA&#x27;s three-mile swimming championship in 1937. Rogers joined the Dale Brothers Circus as a wrestler at age 17. He later worked at a shipyard, and became a police officer.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career and National Wrestling Alliance (1939–1963) ===
Rogers visited the offices of professional wrestling promoters Ray and Frank Hanley, who gave him his first match on July 4, 1939, against Moe Brazen, which he won. Rogers soon became a top professional wrestler using his real name around his hometown as Dutch Rhode, where he gained his first major win over Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis. He continued his career in Houston, where he assumed the name Buddy Rogers. Rogers would get his first title during his tenure there, winning the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship four times, once from Lou Thesz, beginning a long feud between them both in and out of the ring. After leaving the Texas territory for Columbus, Ohio, Rogers bleached his hair, and was given the moniker &quot;Natural Guy&quot; by promoter Jack Pfefer. The moniker later evolved to &quot;Nature Boy&quot;. In the early 1950s, Lillian Ellison (under the moniker Slave Girl Moolah) worked as his valet. Ellison claims that the partnership ended after Rogers pushed for a sexual relationship, which Ellison refused. With the advent of television, Rogers&#x27;s flashy look, great physique and bombastic personality instantly caught the ire of audiences. The first sign of Rogers&#x27;s impact was his involvement in Sam Muchnick&#x27;s opposition promotion in St. Louis, Missouri, a major professional wrestling market at the time. He was pitted against Lou Thesz as a draw. In the end, Muchnick&#x27;s promotion was powerful enough with Rogers as its main star that the two promotions merged. Rogers continued control of the Midwest as a booker and professional wrestler, most notably in Chicago, frequently selling out the 11,000-seat arena. In the 1950s, Rogers expanded into Vincent J. McMahon&#x27;s Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC). He also wrestled in the Al Haft promotion out of Columbus, Ohio in the 1950s and through 1963.

In 1961, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) voted him into an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match. On June 30, 1961, Rogers took the title from Pat O&#x27;Connor in front of 38,622 fans at Comiskey Park, which set a new North American professional wrestling attendance record that stood until the David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions in 1984. In addition, the $148,000 gate in ticket sales was a professional wrestling record for almost twenty years. The contest, which was a two out of three falls match, was billed as the &quot;Match of the Century&quot;, during which both men had gained a pinfall. However, when O&#x27;Connor missed a dropkick and hit his head, Rogers pinned him to win the match and being recognized as the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. A rematch was set between the two for the title months later, where Rogers retained it. At the time, Rogers was working at two different jobs in Chicago, but he never walked into work again according to his autobiography.

Many promoters felt that Rogers favored northeastern promoters over other territories. Promoters and noted shooters Bill Miller and Karl Gotch confronted Rogers in Columbus and broke his hand.

Rogers sustained another injury in Montreal against Killer Kowalski, which kept Rogers on the sidelines. Upon his return, the NWA voted to switch the title back over to Lou Thesz, who publicly disliked Rogers. On January 24, 1963, the match took place in Toronto. Rogers was hesitant about dropping the title, so promoter Sam Muchnick put three safeguards in place to guarantee Rogers&#x27;s cooperation. The first safeguard was formatting the match as a one fall finish, rather than the traditional best two out of three falls. The second safeguard was his threat to give Rogers&#x27;s bond away to charity, rather than returning the deposit to the dethroned Rogers. Every NWA World Heavyweight Champion was required to pay a $25,000 deposit to the NWA Board of Directors, before winning the championship belt. The deposit was held by the NWA for the duration of the champion&#x27;s reign. The third safeguard was Thesz, who could &quot;take&quot; the title if necessary. Ultimately, Thesz won the match and the title.
Rogers was a co-holder of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship with tag team partner &quot;Handsome&quot; Johnny Barend. They won the championship on July 5, 1962, from Johnny Valentine and “Cowboy” Bob Ellis on Capitol Wrestling&#x27;s regular Thursday night Washington, D.C., television show. Arnold Skaaland was a last minute replacement for Ellis whose flight was delayed and unable to get to the arena. With the championship on the line, Rogers and Barend isolated Skaaland whom Rogers forced to submit with his figure-four leglock to win the first fall. After Skaaland was carried from the ring on a stretcher, Valentine continued to fight alone in the second fall. Valentine fought valiantly, but was worn down by Rogers and Barend. Just when it looked like Valentine was going to succumb to the vicious attack of the heels the crowd erupted. The television cameras swung from a view of the ring to &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Ellis running down the aisle in street clothes and carrying a travel suitcase. Ellis jumped into the ring, applied multiple bulldog headlocks and pinned Barend to win the second fall for his team. The third fall featured everyone fighting inside and outside the ring. Finally, Ellis and Barend collided in the corner and knocked each other out. The referee was distracted by Valentine trying to get into the ring as Rogers grabbed an unconscious Barend by his hair and back of his trunks and threw him on top of Ellis for the victory. Rogers and Barend defeated Valentine and Ellis in a title rematch at Madison Square Garden on July 13, 1962. They defended the championship until March 7, 1963, when they lost to Killer Buddy Austin and The Great Scott on Capitol Wrestling&#x27;s regular Thursday night television broadcast. Rogers and Barend split briefly and feuded, but they reunited that summer to defeat Bobo Brazil and Bruno Sammartino in a best two out of three falls tag team match. During the Rogers–Barend feud, Rogers regularly teamed with a masked wrestler, The Shadow. Prior to his title reign with Barend, Rogers frequently teamed with the &quot;Big O&quot; Bob Orton. During the 1950s, Rogers&#x27;s main tag team partner was The Great Scott.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation and semi-retirement (1963–1969) ===
After Thesz defeated Rogers for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Northeast promoters Toots Mondt and Vincent J. McMahon withdrew their membership from the NWA and formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now WWE). The promoters felt that Thesz was not a strong draw in their territory, therefore the WWWF billed Rogers as their world champion as did Fred Kohler&#x27;s Chicago promotion from January 25. Rogers was formally recognized as the first ever WWWF World Heavyweight Champion on April 11, 1963, when promoter and first WWWF President Willie Gilzenberg handed Rogers the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship belt on Washington, D.C., television. Gilzenberg explained that Rogers won a wrestling tournament in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, although it was fictional. WWE.com currently cites April 25, 1963, as the beginning of Rogers&#x27;s reign. Rogers was a top draw, but his reign was ultimately cut short by a mild heart attack which greatly hindered his endurance and in-ring performance. Vincent J. McMahon and Toots Mondt were in a panic and hid Rogers&#x27;s medical problems. In an emergency title switch, Rogers lost to Bruno Sammartino in a quick 48 second match on May 17, 1963, in Madison Square Garden. The match had to be kept short for fear of Rogers having a major heart attack and dying in the ring.

Following his loss to Sammartino, health problems forced Rogers to wrestle in only a limited number of short singles matches that lasted a minute or two. He participated in a few tag team matches with partner Handsome Johnny Barend where he spent almost the entire match in his corner on the ring apron while Barend did the wrestling. Rogers defeated Hans &quot;The Great&quot; Mortier in less than a minute with the figure-four leglock in Madison Square Garden and teamed with Handsome Johnny Barend to take two out of three falls via pin from Sammartino and Bobo Brazil, with Rogers pinning Sammartino for the final fall. The big rematch was to be held October 4, 1963, at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tickets were printed with Rogers–Sammartino on them. However, it was announced that Rogers was retiring and Gorilla Monsoon, who had won a tournament, got the title shot that night. In 1966–1967, Rogers wrestled in 18 short matches in Canada. In 1969, Rogers appeared in 19 quick matches in an Ohio-based promotion called Wrestling Show Classics before he realized his health was not getting better to the point where he could wrestle. He spent time on television talking with his former manager Bobby Davis. A decade later, Rogers would try to make a legitimate comeback.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions and return to WWF (1978–1992) ===
In 1979, Rogers returned to wrestling as a fan favorite in Florida, although he was in his late 50s. He later moved up to Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in the Carolinas as a villain manager overseeing professional wrestlers like Jimmy Snuka, Ken Patera, Gene Anderson, Dewey Robertson and Big John Studd. His most notable moment during his run in the Carolinas was his feud with the new &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Ric Flair, before Rogers put over Flair on July 9, 1978. After his time in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW), he moved back into WWF where he was a fan favorite manager and part-time professional wrestler who also hosted the interview segment &quot;Rogers&#x27; Corner&quot; until 1983. Rogers was instrumental in helping turn Jimmy Snuka into a fan favorite, leading to Rogers managing Snuka for his feud with Lou Albano and Ray Stevens. During the feud, Rogers broke his hip and retired from professional wrestling for good. His show was replaced by &quot;Victory Corner&quot;, which would later be replaced by &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;. He would continue to make sporadic appearances in the WWF until 1984, right before the beginning of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling era. Rogers, who was at the age of 71, was set to wrestle yet another &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, this time Buddy Landel, in a comeback match for the Tri-State Wrestling Alliance (TWA, a predecessor of Extreme Championship Wrestling – ECW) in early 1992, but the promotion went out of business and the match never occurred.

==Personal life==
Rogers married Ruth &quot;Debbie&quot; Nixon in 1969 and subsequently adopted her son, David Buddy Rogers, as his own. When Rogers retired from wrestling, he took a job as a manager at a Playboy Club casino. He resided in Haddonfield, New Jersey, until he moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1987.

In 1989, while Rogers was eating a turkey sandwich at a hoagie shop in Florida, a man in his late 20s began verbally abusing two female employees. Rogers told the man to stop shouting, but the man called him “old” and challenged him to a fight. Rogers proceeded to push the man into a wall, leading to the man throwing a chair at him. Rogers fought back and threw the man five feet into a refrigerator. Rogers then hit him in the stomach, knocking him into the kitchen. He then held onto Rogers&#x27; hair repeatedly telling him to stop, fleeing the shop afterwards. Rogers, who received 14 stitches after the fight, stated to a reporter that the man calling him “old” was the worst part of the incident, then saying &quot;Hell, I&#x27;m only 68, that&#x27;s not so old.&quot;

== Death ==
In early 1992, Rogers’ health deteriorated. He had a broken arm and suffered three strokes, two of them occurring on the same day. At his own request he was not placed on life-support and died on June 26, 1992, at the age of 71. Other reports suggest that his death was as the result of a heart attack. He had previously suffered a fall at a supermarket and subsequently underwent heart-bypass surgery.

== Legacy ==
Lou Thesz, Rogers&#x27;s long-time colleague and frequent opponent, described Rogers&#x27;s early impact in his memoir, &quot;Hooker&quot;:

Rogers is remembered by fans and performers alike as one of the top all-time stars in the business, but it&#x27;s probably not common knowledge just how influential he was... he broke into the business somewhere around 1941 as a hero-type personality, with little more going for him than a good body and natural charisma in the ring – which is actually a pretty good beginning – and he was a hit almost from the start. He had that indefinable something fans responded to, and he was sharp enough to build upon what he had, paying attention to what got a reaction from the fans. What evolved over several years was the &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, the prototype of the cocky, strutting, sneering, arrogant peroxide blond villain that is almost a tired wrestling cliché today. Rogers invented the character, and I believe he did it better than anyone.

Thesz continued,

He was also one of the first guys to rely a lot on what we called &quot;flying&quot; moves in the ring – body slams, dropkicks, piledrivers, ricochets off the ropes into his opponent, action moves that are commonplace today. All of those moves were in use before Rogers came along, but they were used sparingly; most of the wrestling prior to Rogers&#x27;s emergence was done on the mat. Rogers was the first to use flying moves in quantity, staying off the mat, and the style was so popular with the fans that other wrestlers, including me, followed his lead.

Another Rogers contribution to modern professional wrestling was his bombastic interviewing style. Professional wrestlers might talk and converse with interviewers, but Rogers bragged and boasted about how great he was and how pathetic his opponents were. After winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Pat O&#x27;Connor in Chicago in 1961, Rogers accepted the title belt and then took the microphone and shouted, &quot;To a nicer guy it couldn&#x27;t happen!&quot; This type of bombastic style went over well with the fans and has been followed ever since. However, Rogers was not well liked during his prime years because he had a habit of taking advantage of opponents in the ring. During his prime years, he was known as much for his distinctive peacock-like strut as for his wrestling performance. He was also very skilled at drawing heat during interviews, with a smug &quot;to a nicer guy, it couldn&#x27;t have happened&quot; being his catchphrase of sorts whenever he was victorious. He may have been the first authentic &quot;charismatic&quot; professional wrestler, who, along with almost equally charismatic Bobby Davis, would use cruel, yet hilarious, put-downs of his opponents, such as: &quot;After I get through with him, he&#x27;ll be back driving a garbage truck where he belongs&quot;. Almost like a tag team of pseudo-arrogance, Davis would incredulously say of Roger&#x27;s opponents that they did not even deserve to be in the same ring as Rogers, bemoaning the fact that &quot;this is a sport of kings!&quot; Although he was viewed as a villain in most areas during most of his career, Rogers was always a fan favorite in cities throughout Ohio. This was probably due to his appearances for many years with the Al Haft Promotion who had their offices in Columbus.

According to Thesz, Rogers, although admittedly an excellent professional wrestler and a superb showman, was a manipulative schemer behind the scenes and was fond of saying in private: &quot;Screw your friends and be nice to your enemies, so your enemies will become your friends, and then you can screw them too&quot;. With age, however, Rogers mellowed and became a very respected veteran and spokesman for professional wrestling. Rogers had one of the longest consistent top drawing periods of any main eventer (15 years) and the ability to draw in several different territories successfully. In 1994, he was posthumously inducted into the World Wrestling Federation Hall of Fame class of 1994. Fellow professional wrestlers Ric Flair and Buddy Landel adopted the &quot;Nature Boy&quot; gimmick from Rogers as a tribute to him. Even using Rogers&#x27;s own signature move, the figure-four leglock, as his own, Flair even went as far as doing his own variation of the Rogers strut as well.

<text>The RIVA 128, or &quot;NV3&quot;, was a consumer graphics processing unit created in 1997 by Nvidia. It was the first nVidia product to integrate 3D acceleration in addition to traditional 2D and video acceleration. Its name is an acronym for &quot;Real-time Interactive Video and Animation accelerator&quot;.

The RIVA 128 followed Nvidia&#x27;s less successful &quot;NV1&quot; accelerator and was the first product to gain Nvidia widespread recognition. It was also a major change in Nvidia&#x27;s technological direction.

==History==

By 1996, Nvidia was in poor shape financially. It had initially pursued a completely different type of rendering technology called quadratic texture mapping with its first product, the NV1. Then the company had spent a year trying to use its inferior technology to build the graphics chip for Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast video game console. Sega finally had to pull the plug on Nvidia&#x27;s project and switch vendors, but was convinced to keep Nvidia alive with a $5 million investment.

Nvidia then laid off half of its 100 employees and focused its remaining resources on developing the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia was down to one month of payroll. This extremely desperate situation resulted in what remains &quot;the unofficial company motto&quot; today: &quot;Our company is thirty days from going out of business&quot;. 

==Architecture==

The RIVA 128 was built to render within the Direct3D 5 and OpenGL API specifications. It was designed to accelerate Direct3D to the utmost extent possible, as a departure from Nvidia&#x27;s NV1 chip. The NV1 chip had been designed for a completely different type of rendering technology called quadratic texture mapping, which is not supported by Direct3D.

The graphics accelerator consists of 3.5 million transistors built on SGS-Thomson&#x27;s 5LM 350 nm fabrication process and is clocked at 100 MHz. RIVA 128 has a single pixel pipeline capable of 1 pixel per clock when sampling one texture. It is specified to output pixels at a rate of 100 million per second and 25-pixel triangles at 1.5 million per second. There are 12 KiB of on-chip memory used for pixel and vertex caches. The chip was limited to a 16-bit (Highcolor) pixel format when performing 3D acceleration and a 16-bit Z-buffer.

The 2D accelerator engine within the RIVA 128 is 128 bits wide and also operates at 100 MHz. In this &quot;fast and wide&quot; configuration, as Nvidia referred to it, the RIVA 128 performed admirably for GUI acceleration compared to competitors. A 32-bit hardware VESA-compliant SVGA/VGA core was implemented as well. Video acceleration aboard the chip is optimized for MPEG-2 but lacks full acceleration of that standard. Final picture output is routed through an integrated 206 MHz RAMDAC. RIVA 128 had the advantage of being a combination 2D/3D graphics chip, unlike Voodoo Graphics. This meant that the computer did not require a separate 2D card for output outside of 3D applications. It also allowed 3D rendering within a window. The ability to build a system with just one graphics card, and still have it be feature-complete for the time, made the RIVA 128 a lower-cost high-performance solution.

Nvidia equipped the RIVA 128 with 4 MiB of SGRAM, a new memory technology for the time, clocked at 100 MHz and connected to the graphics processor via a 128-bit memory bus. This provides memory bandwidth of 1.60 gigabytes per second. The memory was used in a unified memory architecture that shared the whole RAM pool with both framebuffer and texture storage. The main benefit of this, over a split design such as that on Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo², was support for 3D resolutions of 800×600 and 960×720, higher than Voodoo&#x27;s 640×480.

In early 1998, Nvidia released a refreshed version called the RIVA 128 ZX. This refreshed design of NV3 increased memory support to 8 MiB and increased RAMDAC frequency to 250 MHz. These additions allowed the RIVA 128 ZX to support higher resolutions and refresh rates. The ZX version was fabricated by SGS-Thomson and TSMC, and uses an 8MB SGRAM memory chip, clocked at 125MHz, from Samsung Electronics.

The RIVA 128 had an AGP 1X bus interface, whereas the ZX version of it was one of the early AGP 2X parts, giving it some more marketing headroom by being on the forefront of interface technology. The graphics processor was built around Intel&#x27;s AGP specification targeting the Intel 440LX chipset for the Pentium II. Nvidia designed the RIVA 128 with a maximum memory capacity of 4 MiB because, at the time, this was the cost-optimal approach for a consumer 3D accelerator. This was the case partly because of the chip&#x27;s capability to store textures in off-screen system RAM in both PCI or AGP configurations.

The next major chip from Nvidia would be the RIVA TNT.

===Image quality===

At the time of the RIVA 128&#x27;s release, 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics had firmly established itself as the 3D hardware benchmark against which all newcomers were compared. The Voodoo was the first 3D game accelerator to offer exceptional performance and quality. The RIVA 128 was scorned for its lower quality rendering (compared to the Voodoo) and rendering errors.

With initial drivers, the RIVA 128 used per-polygon mipmapping instead of the much higher-quality, but more demanding, per-pixel variety. This caused the different texture detail levels to &quot;pop&quot; into place as the player moved through a game and approached each polygon, instead of allowing a seamless, gradual per-pixel transition. Nvidia eventually released drivers that allowed a per-pixel mode. Another issue with the card&#x27;s texturing was its use of automated mipmap generation. While this improves visual quality and performance in games without mipmaps, it also caused unforeseen problems because it forced games to render in a way that they were not programmed for.

NV3&#x27;s bilinear filtering was actually &quot;sharper&quot; than that of 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics. But, while it did not blur textures as much as Voodoo, it did instead add some light noise to textures, because of a lower-fidelity filtering algorithm. There were also problems with noticeable seams between polygons.

While initial drivers did present these image-quality problems, later drivers offered image quality arguably matching that of Voodoo Graphics. In addition, because the RIVA 128 can render at resolutions higher than 640×480, the card can offer quality superior to that of Voodoo Graphics, as shown in the above Quake II screenshot. The final drivers released for the RIVA 128 support per-pixel mipmapping, full-scene anti-aliasing (supersampling), and a number of options to fine-tune features in order to optimize quality and performance.

== Drivers and APIs ==

Drivers were, for a significant portion of the card&#x27;s life, rather rough. Not only were the aforementioned Direct3D issues apparent, but the card lacked good OpenGL support. With RIVA 128, Nvidia began their quest for top-quality OpenGL support, eventually resulting in the board being a capable OpenGL performer. One major disadvantage for Nvidia was that many games during RIVA 128&#x27;s lifetime used 3Dfx&#x27;s proprietary Glide API. Legally, only 3Dfx cards could use 3Dfx&#x27;s Glide API.

Like the competing ATI Rage Pro, RIVA 128 was never able to accelerate the popular Unreal Engine in Direct3D mode due to missing hardware features. It was, however, possible to use the engine&#x27;s OpenGL renderer, but unfortunately OpenGL support was quite slow and buggy in the original Unreal Engine. Performance in Quake III Arena, a game using an engine more advanced than Unreal Engine 1, was better due to the engine having been designed for OpenGL.

Nvidia&#x27;s final RIVA 128 drivers for Windows 9x include a full OpenGL driver. However, for this driver to function, Windows must be set with a desktop color depth of 16-bit.

A driver for RIVA 128 is also included in Windows 2000 and XP, but lacks 3D support. A beta driver with OpenGL support was once leaked by Nvidia but was canceled later, and there is no Windows 2000 driver for RIVA 128 on Nvidia&#x27;s driver site today. Neither the beta driver nor the ones come with Windows 2000/XP could support Direct3D.

== Performance ==
At the time, RIVA 128 was one of the first combination 2D/3D cards that could rival Voodoo Graphics. RIVA 128&#x27;s 2D capability was seen as impressive for its time and was competitive with even high-end 2D-only graphics cards in both quality and performance.

<text>Theodore Davie (March 22, 1852 in Brixton, London – March 7, 1898 in Victoria, British Columbia) was a British Columbia lawyer, politician, and jurist. He practised law in Cassiar and Nanaimo before settling in Victoria and becoming a leading criminal lawyer. He was the brother of Alexander Edmund Batson Davie, who served as premier of British Columbia from 1887 to 1889. Theodore Davie was first elected to the provincial legislature in 1882. In 1889, he became attorney-general under Premier John Robson, and succeeded Robson as premier in 1892.

Davie&#x27;s government passed a &quot;Redistribution Bill&quot; to give the mainland of the province greater representation in the legislature. His government also provided financial incentives to the railways in an effort to stimulate the economy. The Davie government also approved the construction of the province&#x27;s parliament buildings in Victoria despite pressure to move the capital to the mainland.

Davie served as premier until 1895 when he resigned to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia succeeding the province&#x27;s first Chief Justice, Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie.

Theodore Davie is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia.
