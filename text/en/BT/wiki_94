<text>Alessandro Alessandri also known as Alexander ab Alexandro (1461–1523) was a Neapolitan lawyer of great learning, who flourished towards the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century, was descended of the ancient and noble family of the Alexandri of Naples.
==Life and career==
He was born according to some, in 1461. He followed the profession of the law, first at Naples, and afterwards at Rome; but devoted all the time he could spare to the study of polite literature; and at length entirely left the bar, from scruples of conscience respecting the practice of the law, that he might lead a more easy and agreeable life with the muses. “When I saw he,” says he, “that the counsellors could not defend me, nor assist anyone against thy, the power of favour or of the mighty, I said, was in vain. We took so many pains, thus fatigued ourselves with so many reminders or controversies of law, [with learning such a variety of cases so farly involved], thus when I saw the judgment passed, according to virtue none other than its own...To the temerity of every remiss! I corrupted every person who presided over these laws with discussion, Thus giving me determination, not according to these equities involved, nor I, in favour of this or affection, to these individuals involved.” 

The particulars of his life are to be gathered from his work entitled “Genialium Dierum:” It appears by it that he lodged at Rome in a house that was haunted; and he relates many surprising particulars about the ghost, which show him to have been credulous, although perhaps not more so than his contemporaries. He says also, that when he was very young, he went to the lectures of Philetphus, who explained at Rome the Tusculan questions of Cicero; he was there also when Nicholas Perot and Domitius Calderinus read their public lectures upon Martial. Some say that he acted as prothonotary of the kingdom of Naples, and that he discharged the office with great honour; but this is not mentioned in his work.
==Death and legacy==
Apostolo Zeno states that Allessandri died in 1523, and it is generally agreed that he died at Rome, aged about sixty-two. His work, the “Genialium Dirrum,” is a miscellany of learning and philology, somewhat on the model of the “Noctes Atticae” of Aulus Gellius. The first edition was printed at Rome, 1522, fol. (in folio style), under the title of “Alexandri de Alexandro dies Geniales.” Andrew-Tiraqueau wrote a commentary on it, entitled “Semestria,” Lyons, 1586. Notes have also been added to it by Christopher Colerus, and Dennis Gotefrid, or Godfrey, which were printed with Tiraqueau’s commentary, Francfort, 1594, fol. The edition of Paris, 1582, is held in estimation, but the best is that of Leiden, 1673, 2 vols. 8vo. There is another work of his, published before the Genialium Dierum, but afterwards incorporated with it, entitled “Alexandri J. C. Napolitani Dissertationes quatuor de rebus admirundis, &amp;c.” Rome, 4to (quarto), without date, or printer’s name. Mr. Roscoe, who has introduced him in his life of Leo as a member of the academy of Naples, says that his works prove him to have been a man of extensive reading, great industry, and of a considerable share of critical ability, and perhaps as little tinctured with superstition as most of the writers of the age in which he lived.

<text>The Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM) is a conservatoire located in Manchester, England. It is one of four conservatoires associated with the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. In addition to being a centre of music education, RNCM is a busy and diverse public performance venue.

==History==
The RNCM has a history dating back to the 19th century and the establishment of the Royal Manchester College of Music (RMCM). In 1858, Sir Charles Hallé founded the Hallé orchestra in Manchester, and by the early 1890s had raised the idea of a music college in the city. Following an appeal for support, a building on Ducie Street was secured, Hallé was appointed Principal and Queen Victoria conferred the Royal title. The RMCM opened its doors to 80 students in 1893, rising to 117 by the end of the first year. Less than four decades later, in 1920, the Northern School of Music was established (initially as a branch of the Matthay School of Music), and for many years the two institutions peacefully coexisted. It wasn&#x27;t until 1955 that NSM Principal Hilda Collins, in recognising the importance of performance in training students, met with RMCM Principal Frederic Cox to raise the question of merging. Discussions continued until September 1967 when a Joint Committee was formed to oversee plans to combine the two colleges. The RNCM was formed in 1972, moving to its purpose-built home on Oxford Road in 1973.

==Building==

The college building was built on the corner of Oxford Road and Booth Street West between 1968 and 1973 by architects Bickerdike, Allen, and Rich. The two-storey rectangular concrete structure is fronted by tall glazed bays recessed behind an array of square concrete pillars. Originally an elevated walkway ran along the Oxford Road side connecting the building to the former neighbouring Precinct Centre via a bridge over Booth Street East. Truncated sections of this walkway were the vestigial evidence of an unrealised plan to create a network of high-level &quot;boulevards&quot;, providing pedestrian routes on concrete stilts above street level from the RNCM to neighbouring buildings, and extending as far as Hulme and Ancoats. Only the bridges over Oxford Road and Booth Street East were ever constructed.

In 1997–98, the RNCM building was extended by architects Mills Beaumont Leavey Channon, with a new entrance built on the western side, and the walkway was removed.

A major refurbishment of the Concert Hall was undertaken between December 2013 and September 2014 by Scott Hughes Design.

==Academics==
The college offers both undergraduate (BMus and joint MusB/GRNCM course with the University of Manchester in any of the five specialisations offered) and postgraduate taught programmes (PGDip, MMus) in musical performance and composition. In association with Manchester Metropolitan University the college offers research degrees (MPhil, PhD) in musical performance, composition, musicology and music psychology as part of its Graduate School and also confers awards at Companion, Fellowship (FRNCM) and Member level.

In January 2005, the RNCM was awarded £4.5 million by the Higher Education Funding Council for England to become a recognised Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL), the only UK conservatoire to be selected.

The RNCM currently has 770 students and 320 teaching staff, the majority of whom are part-time visiting tutors. Many of the staff also teach at the Junior RNCM, a Saturday music school for talented young musicians who are keen on pursuing a musical career.

===Faculties===
The college is divided into 6 schools by area of specialisation.

*School of Composition
*School of Keyboard Studies
*School of Strings
*School of Vocal Studies and Opera
*School of Wind, Brass &amp; Percussion
*Popular Music

There is also a School of Conducting within its Graduate School.

==Student life==

===Students&#x27; Union===
The RNCM students&#x27; union (RNCMSU) is the main student-run organisation. Besides representing the study body, the RNCMSU also plans and organises social programmes and provides peer support for students. The RNCMSU is member of the National Union of Students.

===Student housing===

There is a residential hall, Sir Charles Groves Hall, next to the campus. Alternatively, students may choose to rent a flat at the Manchester Student Homes, a provider of housing for university students in Manchester run by the Universities.

<doc id="584207" wikidata="Q825337" url="?curid=584207" title="Dichroic prism">
<text>A dichroic prism is a prism that splits light into two beams of differing wavelengths (colour). A trichroic prism assembly combines two dichroic prisms to split an image into 3 colours, typically as red, green and blue of the RGB colour model. They are usually constructed of one or more glass prisms with dichroic optical coatings that selectively reflect or transmit light depending on the light&#x27;s wavelength. That is, certain surfaces within the prism act as dichroic filters. These are used as beam splitters in many optical instruments. (See: Dichroism, for the etymology of the term.)

== Applications in camcorders or digital cameras ==
One common application of dichroic prisms is in some camcorders and high-quality digital cameras. A &quot;trichroic prism assembly&quot; is a combination of two dichroic prisms which are used to split an image into red, green, and blue components, which can be separately detected on three CCD arrays.

A possible layout for the device is shown in the diagram. A light beam enters the first prism (A), and the blue component of the beam is reflected from a low-pass filter coating (F1) that reflects blue light (high-frequency), but transmits longer wavelengths (lower frequencies). The blue beam undergoes total internal reflection from the front of prism A and exits it through a side face. The remainder of the beam enters the second prism (B) and is split by a second filter coating (F2) which reflects red light but transmits shorter wavelengths. The red beam is also totally internally reflected due to a small air-gap between prisms A and B. The remaining green component of the beam travels through prism C.

The trichroic prism assembly can be used in reverse to combine red, green and blue beams into a coloured image, and is used in this way in some projector devices. Assemblies with more than 3 beams are possible.

== Advantages of dichroic prism color separation ==

When used for color separation, in an imaging system, this method has some advantages over other methods, such as the use of a Bayer filter. Most of those characteristics derive from the usage of dichroic filters and are in common with those. The advantages include:

* Minimal light absorption, most of the light is directed to one of the output beams.
* Better color separation than with most other filters.
* Easy to fabricate for any combination of pass bands.
* Does not require color interpolation (demosaicing) and thus avoids all of the false color artifacts commonly seen in demosaiced images.

== Disadvantages of dichroic prism color separation ==

* Since dichroic prisms use dichroic filters, the exact bandpass of each filter depends on the light incidence angle.
* Maximum lens numerical aperture might be restricted due to the geometry of the optical path inside the assembly.
* The exact bandpass depends on the lens numerical aperture, since this factor changes the average light incidence angle in the filters.
* Since some of the glass surfaces are at an angle against the incident beam some polarization by reflection effects can result.

<doc id="584211" wikidata="Q418602" url="?curid=584211" title="Dipeptide">
<text>A dipeptide is an organic compound derived from two amino acids. The constituent amino acids can be the same or different. When different, two isomers of the dipeptide are possible, depending on the sequence. Several dipeptides are physiologically important, and some are both physiologically and commercially significant. A well known dipeptide is aspartame, an artificial sweetener.

Dipeptides are white solids. Many are far more water-soluble than the parent amino acids. For example, the dipeptide Ala-Gln has the solubility of 586 g/L more than 10x the solubility of Gln (35 g/L). Dipeptides also can exhibit different stabilities, e.g. with respect to hydrolysis. Gln does not withstand sterilization procedures, whereas this dipeptide does. Because dipeptides are prone to hydrolysis, the high solubility is exploited in infusions, i.e. to provide nutrition.

==Examples==
===Commercial value===
About six dipeptides are of commercial interest.
*Aspartame (&quot;N&quot;--α-aspartyl--phenylalanine 1-methyl ester) is an artificial sweetener.
*Carnosine (&quot;beta&quot;-alanyl--histidine) and Anserine (&quot;beta&quot;-alanyl-&quot;N&quot;-methyl histidine) are highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues. They are used in sports medicines.
*Acetylcarnosine, cataract prevention
*Ala-Gln and Gly-Tyr, infusion
*Val-Tyr, antihypertensive

===Other dipeptides===
*Homoanserine (&quot;N&quot;-(4-aminobutyryl)--histidine) is another dipeptide identified in the brain and muscles of mammals.
*Diphenylalanine is the most studied building block in peptide nanotechnology
*Kyotorphin (-tyrosyl--arginine) is a neuroactive dipeptide which plays a role in pain regulation in the brain.
* (or ophidine) (&quot;beta&quot;-alanyl-&quot;N&quot; &quot;tau&quot;-methyl histidine) has been identified in the muscles of several species of mammal (including man), and the chicken.
*Glorin (&quot;N&quot;-propionyl-γ--glutamyl--ornithine-δ-lac ethyl ester) is a chemotactic dipeptide for the slime mold &quot;Polysphondylium violaceum&quot;.
*Barettin (cyclo-[(6-bromo-8-en-tryptophan)-arginine]) is a cyclic dipeptide from the marine sponge &quot;Geodia barretti&quot;.
*Pseudoproline
*Dialanine is commonly used as a model in molecular dynamics.
*Xenortides, isolated from the bacterium &quot;Xenorhabdus nematophila&quot;

==Production==
===Synthetic dipeptides===
Dipeptides are produced by coupling amino acids. The amino group on one amino acid is rendered non-nucleophilic (P in eq) and the carboxylic acid group in the second amino acid is deactivated as its methyl ester. The two modified amino acids are then combined in the presence of a coupling agent, which facilitates formation of the amide bond:
:RCH(NHP)CO2H + R&#x27;CH(NH2)CO2CH3 → RCH(NHP)C(O)NH(CHR&#x27;)CO2CH3 + H2O
Subsequent to this coupling reaction, the amine protecting group P and the ester are converted to the free amine and carboxylic acid, respectively.

For many amino acids, the ancillary functional groups are protected. The condensation of the amine and the carboxylic acid to form the peptide bond generally employs coupling agents to activate the carboxylic acid.

The Bergmann azlactone peptide synthesis is a classic organic synthesis for the preparation of dipeptides.

===Biosynthesis===
Dipeptides are produced from polypeptides by the action of the hydrolase enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase. Dietary proteins are digested to dipeptides and amino acids, and the dipeptides are absorbed more rapidly than the amino acids, because their uptake involves a separate mechanism. Dipeptides activate G-cells found in the stomach to secrete gastrin.

==Diketopiperazines (cyclic dipeptides)==
Diketopiperazines are a special class of dipeptides, which are cyclic. They form as side products in peptide synthesis. Many have been produced from non-canonical amino acids.

<text>Samuel Richard &quot;Sandy&quot; Berger (October 28, 1945 – December 2, 2015) was a Democratic attorney who served as the 18th US National Security Advisor for U.S. President Bill Clinton from 1997 to 2001 after he had served as the Deputy National Security Advisor for the Clinton administration from 1993 to 1997.

In 2005, he was fined and sentenced to two years of probation, plus community service, for the unauthorized removal of classified material from the National Archives. When disbarment proceedings were initiated on account of his theft of documents, Berger gave up his license to practice law by conceding the truth of the material allegations of misconduct and consenting to his disbarment.

==Early life and career==
Berger was born to a Jewish family in Millerton, New York, where his parents ran a surplus store. He graduated from Webutuck High School in 1963, earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in government from Cornell University in 1967, and his earned Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1971.

At Cornell, Berger was a member of the Quill and Dagger society with Paul Wolfowitz and Stephen Hadley. Opposed to the Vietnam War, Berger began working for Senator George McGovern&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1972. While there, he met Bill Clinton, forming a friendship that lasted for decades. Berger later urged Clinton to run for President of the United States.

After the McGovern campaign, Berger gained experience working in a variety of government posts, including serving as Special Assistant to Mayor of New York City John Lindsay and Legislative Assistant to U.S. Senator Harold Hughes of Iowa and Congressman Joseph Resnick of New York. He was also Deputy Director of Policy Planning for the U.S. Department of State from 1977 to 1980 under Secretary of State Cyrus Vance during the Carter administration.

After leaving the State Department, Berger went on to join the law firm Hogan &amp; Hartson where he helped expand the firm&#x27;s international law practice. As a partner, he opened the firm&#x27;s first two international offices, in London and Brussels. &quot;Sandy Berger&quot;, Nancy Pelosi said in 1997, &quot;was the point-man at ... Hogan &amp; Hartson ... for the trade office of the Chinese government. He was a lawyer-lobbyist.&quot;

==Clinton administration==
Berger served as Senior Foreign Policy Advisor to Governor Clinton during the campaign, and as Assistant Transition Director for National Security of the 1992 Clinton-Gore Transition. Berger served eight years on the National Security Council staff, first from 1993 to 1997 as deputy national security advisor, under Anthony Lake, whom Berger had recommended for the role, and then succeeding Lake as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs from 1997 to 2001.

Berger was a central figure in formulating the foreign policy of the Clinton Administration, and played an integral role advancing the administration&#x27;s self-described objectives of advancing &quot;democracy, shared prosperity, and peace.&quot; In President Clinton&#x27;s words, &quot;Nobody was more knowledgeable about policy or smarter about how to formulate it. He was both great in analyzing a situation and figuring out what to do about it. His gifts proved invaluable time and time again, in Latin America, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, and the Middle East.&quot;

Key achievements during Berger&#x27;s NSC tenure included the 1995 peso recovery package in Mexico, NATO enlargement, Operation Desert Fox, the Dayton Accords that ended the civil conflict in Bosnia, the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, the Good Friday Agreement that helped bring about peace in Northern Ireland, and the administration&#x27;s policy of engagement with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In a March 2005 oral history interview at the University of Virginia&#x27;s Miller Center, Berger noted, &quot;I think during the &#x27;90s we took China from outside the international system and brought it inside the international system, partly through trade, and economics, and otherwise.&quot;

On July 4, 1999, in what South Asia expert Bruce Reidel called Berger&#x27;s &quot;finest hour,&quot; Berger advised President Clinton through a pivotal negotiation with Pakistan&#x27;s prime minister Nawaz Sharif to pull that country&#x27;s troops back from Kashmir, averting a potentially cataclysmic nuclear war with India.

Berger also advised the President regarding the Khobar Towers bombing and responses to the terrorist bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In the final years of the Clinton administration, combating terrorism was the paramount foreign policy priority; Berger said in his March 2005 oral history interview at UVA&#x27;s Miller Center, &quot;I said to Condoleezza Rice during the transition ... that the number-one issue that she would deal with as national security advisor was terrorism in general and al-Qaeda specifically.&quot;

==Controversies==

===Stock ownership===
In November 1997, Berger paid a $23,000 civil penalty to settle conflict of interest allegations stemming from his failure to sell his stock of Amoco Corporation as ordered by the White House. Berger was advised by the White House to sell the stock in early 1994. He said he had planned to sell the stock, but then forgot. He denied knowingly participating in decisions in which he had a financial interest. With no evidence that Berger intended to break the law, the United States Department of Justice determined a civil penalty was adequate for a &quot;non-willful violation&quot; of the conflict of interest law.

===Chinese nuclear espionage===

In 1999, Berger was criticized for failing to promptly inform President Clinton of his knowledge that the People&#x27;s Republic of China had managed to acquire the designs of a number of U.S. nuclear warheads. Berger was originally briefed of the espionage by the Department of Energy (DOE) in April 1996, but did not inform the president until July 1997.

A number of Republicans, including then presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander, called for Berger&#x27;s resignation. They accused him of ignoring the allegations of Chinese espionage. &quot;For his unwillingness to act on this serious matter, Mr. Berger should resign&quot;, Alexander said. &quot;If he does not, he should be relieved of his duties by President Clinton.&quot; President Clinton rejected the calls: &quot;The record is that we acted aggressively,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Mr. Berger acted appropriately.&quot;

===Unauthorized removal and destruction of classified material===

On July 19, 2004, it was revealed that the United States Department of Justice was investigating Berger for unauthorized removal of classified documents in October 2003 from a National Archives reading room prior to testifying before the 9/11 Commission. The documents were five classified copies of a single report commissioned from Richard Clarke covering internal assessments of the Clinton Administration&#x27;s handling of the unsuccessful 2000 millennium attack plots. An associate of Berger said Berger took one copy in September 2003 and four copies in October 2003, allegedly by stuffing the documents into his socks and pants. Berger subsequently lied to investigators when questioned about the removal of the documents.

In April 2005, Berger pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material from the National Archives in Washington, D.C.

Berger was fined $50,000, sentenced to serve two years of probation and 100 hours of community service, and stripped of his security clearance for three years. The Justice Department initially said Berger only stole copies of classified documents and not originals, but the House Government Reform Committee later revealed that an unsupervised Berger had been given access to classified files of original, uncopied, uninventoried documents on terrorism. During the House Government Reform Committee hearings, Nancy Kegan Smith — who was the director of the presidential documents staff at the National Archives and Records Administration — acknowledged that she had granted Berger access to original materials in her office.

On December 20, 2006, Inspector General Paul Brachfeld reported that Berger took a break to go outside without an escort. &quot;In total, during this visit, he removed four documents ... Mr. Berger said he placed the documents under a trailer in an accessible construction area outside Archives 1 (the main Archives building)&quot;. Berger acknowledged having later retrieved the documents from the construction area and returned with them to his office.

The Board on Professional Responsibility of the Bar of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals commenced a professional-misconduct disciplinary proceeding against Berger, based on his conviction for theft of classified documents. On May 17, 2007, Berger was disbarred from the practice of law upon consenting to his disbarment, conceding that the material allegations of misconduct were true and he knew that he could not successfully defend against the disciplinary proceeding. He released a statement which said, in part, &quot;I have decided to voluntarily relinquish my license. ... While I derived great satisfaction from years of practicing law, I have not done so for 15 years and do not envision returning to the profession. I am very sorry for what I did, and I deeply apologize.&quot; By consenting to disbarment, Berger avoided cross-examination by the Bar Counsel regarding details of his thefts.

==Post-government==

After leaving the Clinton Administration, Berger became chairman of Stonebridge International, an international advisory firm he co-founded in 2001 which focused on aiding companies in their expansion into emerging markets such as Brazil, China, India, and Russia. Stonebridge International merged in 2009 with The Albright Group, a similar firm founded by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to form Albright Stonebridge Group, a global strategy and commercial diplomacy firm acquired by Dentons in 2021.

Berger was also chairman of the D.B. Zwirn Global Advisory Board, an international investment fund and merchant capital provider founded in 2001 and with offices throughout North America, Europe and Asia.

In late 2003, Berger was called to testify before the 9/11 Commission regarding steps taken against terrorism during his tenure and the information he provided to his successor, Condoleezza Rice. At the time, he was also acting as an informal foreign policy advisor to Senator John Kerry during his campaign for the presidency, resigning from the role amid controversy regarding his preparations for testifying before the 9/11 Commission. Berger served as a foreign policy adviser to Senator Hillary Clinton in her 2008 presidential campaign.

He was an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He also served on the International Advisory Council of the Brookings Doha Center. He served on the board of directors of the International Crisis Group and World Food Program USA, and also on the advisory boards of the National Security Network, and America Abroad Media.

==Personal life and death==
Berger lived in the American University Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C., was married to Susan Harrison Berger, and had three children.

Berger died of cancer in Washington, D.C., on December 2, 2015, at the age of 70, more than a year after being diagnosed.

President Barack Obama released the following statement on learning of Berger&#x27;s death:

==Awards==
In November 2015, Berger was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun by the Japanese government for his contributions to promotion of a strong and friendly relationship between the United States and Japan, particularly in his role as National Security Adviser to President Clinton. He also provided legal and commercial advice to the Embassy of Japan in Washington, D.C.

On December 1, 2015, World Food Program USA announced that it has given its inaugural Global Humanitarian Award to Samuel R. Berger in recognition of his decades of leadership helping families in need across the globe. Additionally, the World Food Program USA established the Samuel R. Berger Humanitarian Fund, which will support humanitarian organizations as they work to eradicate hunger around the world.

In 2000, Berger was presented with an honorary degree from Tel Aviv University in Israel.

<doc id="584216" wikidata="Q7193401" url="?curid=584216" title="Pigmartyr">
<text>Pigmartyr (2004) is an album by Raymond Watts, a.k.a. PIG. This was the first album he released under the moniker Watts instead of PIG. The First copies (approx. 500) were signed and numbered by Raymond Watts. The album was remastered and rereleased through Metropolis as a PIG album under the title Pigmata in 2005, with three additional tracks mixed by Isaac Glendening of Cesium 137.

==Album information==
Raymond Watts&#x27; first release since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Genuine American Monster&quot;, &quot;Pigmartyr&quot; is a bit of a departure from typical Pig material. Gone are most of the bombastic string sections and orchestral influence, &quot;Pigmartyr&quot; takes a turn toward the hard rock side, and has a much more raw and stripped down feel.

The album was largely recorded in London, UK with a number of collaborators, including a duet (&quot;Take&quot;) with UK rocker Harry (a.k.a. Dirty Harry) and two songs (&quot;Situation&quot; and &quot;Here to Stay&quot;) co-written with Marc Heal of Cubanate.

&quot;Pigmartyr&quot; was originally planned as a PIG band album under the title &quot;Lust for Lard&quot;. After a series of drawn-out recording sessions and release date changes, it was eventually released by Grand Recordings as a Watts album in the summer of 2004.

The album went on to become a rather large success at Metropolis Records, keeping the #1 spot on Metropolis&#x27; best seller list for several weeks.

<doc id="584217" wikidata="Q363490" url="?curid=584217" title="Sebastian Bach">
<text>Sebastian Philip Bierk (born April 3, 1968), known professionally as Sebastian Bach, is a Canadian-American singer who achieved mainstream success as the frontman of the hard rock band Skid Row from 1987 to 1996. He has acted on Broadway and has made appearances in film and television such as &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;, &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; and &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. He continues his music career as a solo artist.

== Early years ==
Bach was born in the Bahamas and was raised in Peterborough, Ontario. He is one of eight children. His brother Zac Bierk is a former professional ice hockey player.

His father, David Bierk (d. 2002), was a noted painter. He painted the cover of Skid Row&#x27;s album &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; and inside cover art of &quot;Subhuman Race&quot;, as well as the album cover of Bach&#x27;s solo effort &quot;Angel Down&quot; and inside art for its follow-up, &quot;Give &#x27;Em Hell&quot;.

Bach joined a church choir when he was eight years old, and found much joy in singing &quot;Gloria in Excelsis Deo&quot; with them. He knew while singing the hymn that he would sing for the rest of his life.

==Career==

===Kid Wikkid (1983–1985)===
The members of Kid Wikkid were based in Peterborough, Ontario. Upon hearing of the band and unaware of their ages, 14-year-old Bach auditioned for the group, and was hired by guitar player and band leader Jason Delorme. Kid Wikkid moved back to Toronto, and Bach&#x27;s dad eventually allowed Bach to move in with an aunt.

===Skid Row (1987–1996)===
Skid Row initially formed in the mid-1980s with lead vocalist Matt Fallon fronting the group, and they began playing at various clubs around the New Jersey area. Fallon left the band in 1987, leaving Skid Row in search of a lead vocalist. Bach was spotted singing at rock photographer Mark Weiss&#x27;s wedding by Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s parents, who subsequently approached him and suggested he get in touch with their son&#x27;s friend, Dave Sabo, who was looking for a lead vocalist for his band. Bach was wary of joining another US-based band after briefly being a member of Detroit&#x27;s Madam X. Upon hearing Skid Row&#x27;s demo tapes, however, Bach flew to New Jersey to audition and became the up-and-coming band&#x27;s lead vocalist in early 1987.
Skid Row achieved commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with its first two albums &quot;Skid Row&quot; (1989) and &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; (1991) certified multi-platinum, the latter of which reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; (1995) was also critically acclaimed.

Bach has received criticism for a photo, taken in 1989, in which he is wearing a T-shirt reading &quot;AIDS Kills Fags Dead&quot;, a play on the tagline at the time for the insecticide Raid, &quot;Raid Kills Bugs Dead&quot;. In a 2003 interview, he stated about the controversy, &quot;That was really stupid and wrong for me to wear that for one-half hour in my life. What nobody brings up is in 2000, when I was in &#x27;Jekyll &amp; Hyde,&#x27; and at an auction for Broadway Cares, I donated $12,000 of my own money to fight AIDS.&quot;

Following disagreements over musical material and infuriating Bolan, Bach was fired from the band in 1996. However, rumors circulated that he had left the band due to his other bandmates believing they should not play as an opening act for Kiss. Bandmate Rachel Bolan also had a side project, a punk band Prunella Scales who were playing at the same time as the planned Kiss show. The rift between Bach and the other band members subsequently led to his leaving Skid Row. Four years later, Skid Row was one of the opening acts for the 2000 Kiss Farewell Tour, without Bach.

===Broadway and other projects (1996–2006)===
In 1993, Bach shortly toured with Triumph after the release of their album &quot;Edge of Excess&quot;, providing lead vocals up until the band broke up later the same year.

In 1996, Bach joined The Last Hard Men, an alternative rock supergroup formed by Breeders lead guitarist Kelley Deal, which also included Frogs guitarist Jimmy Flemion and Smashing Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. The group recorded a full-length self-titled album for Atlantic Records, who then opted not to release it. In 1998 it was released on Kelley Deal&#x27;s label, Nice Records, with no fanfare and a very limited pressing of 1,000 CDs. The band also recorded a cover of the Alice Cooper song &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; for the soundtrack album of the 1996 film &quot;Scream&quot;.

In 1999, Bach released his debut solo album &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Bach Alive!&quot;, his first release after his departure from Skid Row. Mainly a live album of Bach&#x27;s Skid Row songs, it also presented five new studio recordings, including the single &quot;Superjerk, Superstar, Supertears&quot;.

In 2000, Bach began performing in Broadway productions. He made his Broadway debut with the title role(s) in &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; in April 2000. He also appeared as Riff Raff in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; in 2001. On November 28, 2001 Bach appeared at New York Steel, a benefit concert held in response to 9/11.

In early 2002, he became the host of &quot;VH1&#x27;s Forever Wild&quot;. In October of that year, Bach was signed to perform in the national touring production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, playing the title role alongside &quot;JCS&quot; veteran Carl Anderson.

A DVD video of live performances called &quot;Forever Wild&quot; was released in June 2004. That same year, he reprised the title role(s) in another showing of &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;.

In 2003, Bach tried out for Velvet Revolver before the band found Scott Weiland, but was turned down because, according to Slash, &quot;We sounded like Skid Roses!&quot; From 2003 to 2007, Bach had a recurring role on the WB television show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as &quot;Gil&quot;, the lead guitarist in Lane Kim&#x27;s band, &quot;Hep Alien&quot;. Members of Bach Tight Five (a project initiated by Bach in 2004, but dissolved shortly thereafter) lived with Bach and his family as documented on VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Married ...Sebastian Bach&quot;, one of the &quot;I Married ...&quot; series. In 2005, Bach collaborated with Henning Pauly to be the singer on the Frameshift album called &quot;An Absence of Empathy&quot;, released in April 2005. He was recommended to Henning by Dream Theater&#x27;s James LaBrie.
On May 12 and 14, 2006, at the Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; warmup show at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, Bach joined Axl Rose on stage for the song &quot;My Michelle&quot;. He joined Rose and the rest for a third time the following night (May 15) to sing &quot;My Michelle&quot; once again. He also joined them for their Pre-Download Festival show in the Apollo Hammersmith, London, singing My Michelle. Rose introduced Bach by saying that the two had rekindled their friendship in the previous week after 13 years of not speaking. On June 4, 9 &amp; 11 he again joined Rose on stage at the 2006 Gods of Metal Festival (Milan), Download Festival in RDS Dublin and in Donington, respectively. On September 23, 2006, he joined Axl on stage once again at KROQ-FM&#x27;s Inland Invasion festival in California for a rendition of &quot;My Michelle&quot;.

===Reality TV and &quot;Angel Down&quot; (2006–2010)===
Bach starred in the 2006 VH1 reality show &quot;Supergroup&quot;, in which he, along with Ted Nugent, Scott Ian, Jason Bonham and Evan Seinfeld, were tasked with forming a heavy metal supergroup, with Bach as the lead vocalist. The seven-episode series was filmed during a twelve-day period when the musicians all lived together in a mansion in Las Vegas. The resulting band, originally called &quot;Fist&quot;, was eventually named Damnocracy; both names were Bach&#x27;s ideas. Damnocracy had no recorded output.

In 2007, Bach announced a partnership record label with EMI to jointly create a label owned by him, including his album &quot;Angel Down&quot;, which was released on November 20, 2007. Bach also recorded backing vocals for the track &quot;Sorry&quot; on Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; long-delayed &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, which was released in November 2008. He spent the summer of 2008 playing with Poison and Dokken.

He competed on the 2007 MTV reality show &quot;Celebrity Rap Superstar&quot;, coming in third place.

Bach was the winner of the second season of the CMT reality show &quot;Gone Country&quot;, which aired in 2008.

===&quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot; and Sterling&#x27;s departure (2010–2012)===
Bach toured as an opening act for Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Chinese Democracy Tour&quot; 2009–2010, and performed &quot;My Michelle&quot; with Axl Rose in Quebec City on February 1, 2010. On January 5, 2011, he was featured on NBC&#x27;s Jimmy Fallon Show in a live performance and a subsequent video of &quot;We Are The Ducks&quot;, a power ballad written for University of Oregon Ducks, set to play in the BCS national championship game Monday, January 10, 2011. In 2011, Bach was interviewed by British metalcore band Asking Alexandria in the March/April issue of &quot;Revolver&quot;. The band are fans of Skid Row and covered two of their songs the preceding year of the interview. The same year, Bach performed &quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot; with the band live at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards and Rock on the Range. Bach was also filmed in their music video &quot;Closure&quot;.

Bach provided the voice of Prince Triton, King Neptune&#x27;s rebellious son, in the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode, &quot;SpongeBob and the Clash of Triton&quot; in 2010. On June 15, 2011, Bach revealed the title of his upcoming solo album would be &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot;. On July 8, 2011 track list, cover art and title of the first single were revealed. It was released September 27, 2011 for North America and worldwide and September 23, 2011 for Europe on Frontiers Records. On August 13, 2012, Nick Sterling was fired by Bach after refusing to sign an agreement to appear on an undisclosed TV show.

=== &quot;Big Noize&quot; (2012–2013) ===
Formed in 2007, Big Noize was a supergroup consisting in founder member and drummer Vinny Appice (Black Sabbath, Dio, Heaven &amp; Hell) plus other &quot;monsters&quot; such as guitarist Carlos Cavazo (Quiet Riot), later replaced by George Lynch (Dokken, Lynch Mob), bassist Phil Soussan (Ozzy Osbourne) and vocalist Joe Lynn Turner (Rainbow). Turner was replaced by Bach for the Kavarna Rock festival on July 14, 2012 and for a tour to South America, starting in Chile on July 9, 2013.

===&quot;Give &#x27;Em Hell and touring&quot; (2013–2023)===

On April 30, 2013, Bach confirmed via Twitter that a new studio album was in the works. He went on to say that Bob Marlette would be returning as producer. Bach had collaboration work for the upcoming album with John 5, Duff McKagan, and Steve Stevens. On January 13, 2014, &quot;Give &#x27;Em Hell&quot; was announced with a prospective release date of April 22, 2014. He also appeared in two &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; episodes from their 2014 season. In 2014, Bach completed his Give &#x27;Em Hell tour and in 2015, Bach went on another tour titled the &quot;18 and LIVE&quot; tour.

In 2019, Bach toured behind the 30th anniversary of Skid Row&#x27;s self-titled debut album, playing it live in its entirety. On July 20, 2021, it was announced that Bach would be doing a tour in the fall for the 30th anniversary of Skid Row&#x27;s &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;.

===&quot;Child Within the Man&quot; (2023–present)===
In 2023, Bach competed in season ten of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Tiki&quot;. He was eliminated in &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; alongside Ginuwine as &quot;Husky&quot;. Also in December 2023, he released his first new song in nearly ten years, &quot;What Do I Got to Lose?&quot;

In March 2024, Bach announced his forthcoming album &quot;Child Within the Man&quot;. It was released on May 10.

==Personal life==
At one time, Bach lived in Red Bank, New Jersey. In August 2011, his New Jersey home was damaged by Hurricane Irene and declared uninhabitable. Several Kiss and Skid Row artifacts (including Skid Row master tapes) were in the house, but none were damaged. His father&#x27;s art, comic books, and the Kiss gargoyles from their 1979 tour were also salvaged.

In the mid-1980s, Bach began dating Maria Aquinar. The couple had a son, Paris, in 1988. Bach and Aquinar married in July 1992 and had another son, London, in 1994 and a daughter, Sebastiana, born in 2007. Bach and Aquinar split up in April 2010.

In December 2010, Bach began dating model Minnie Gupta. They were engaged in April 2012 but ended their engagement in late 2014.

On December 28, 2014, Bach became engaged to Suzanne Le after two months of dating. They married in August 2015 and currently live in Los Angeles.

On July 13, 2017, Bach underwent &quot;singing-related&quot; hernia surgery. He started to recover a month later and then explained that the operation was needed, &quot;because [he] literally screamed [his] guts out.&quot;

Bach endorsed US Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election.

<text>Salvatore &quot;Robert&quot; Loggia ( , ; January 3, 1930 – December 4, 2015) was an American actor. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; (1985) and won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Big&quot; (1988).

In a career spanning over sixty years, Loggia performed in many films, including &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), three &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films, &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; (1982), &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; (1985), &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988), &quot;Innocent Blood&quot; (1992), &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996), &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997), &quot;Return to Me&quot; (2000), and &quot;Tim and Eric&#x27;s Billion Dollar Movie&quot; (2012).

He also appeared on television series including the Walt Disney limited series, &quot;The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca&quot; (starring role-1958), he played T. Hewitt Edward Cat in the 1966–1967 NBC martial arts / action series &quot;T.H.E. Cat&quot;, and was Nick Mancuso in &quot;Mancuso, FBI&quot; (1989–1990). Loggia appeared in &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; (2001), &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (2004), and &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot; (2011).

==Early life and education==
Loggia was born in New York, New York, on January 3, 1930, to Biagio Loggia, a shoemaker born in Palma di Montechiaro, Province of Agrigento, Sicily, and Elena Blandino, a homemaker born in Vittoria, Province of Ragusa, Sicily. He grew up in the Little Italy neighborhood, where the family spoke Sicilian at home. He graduated from New Dorp High School before taking courses at Wagner College where he joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. In 1951, he earned a degree in journalism from University of Missouri. He later studied acting with Alvina Krause at Northwestern University.

After serving in the United States Army as a reporter for the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service in the Caribbean, he started his acting career at the Actors Studio, studying under Stella Adler.

==Career==
Loggia&#x27;s stage roles include Solyony in &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; (1964) and as Al in &quot;Boom Boom Room&quot; (1973).

Although Loggia made his first film, &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; (1956), in an uncredited appearance, it was not until he was cast as a New Mexico lawman Elfego Baca, two years later, that he made a breakthrough in Hollywood. Loggia was a radio and TV anchor on the Southern Command Network in the Panama Canal Zone, and he came to prominence playing a real-life sheriff in &quot;The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca&quot;, a series of Walt Disney TV shows.

He later starred as the proverbial cat-burglar-turned-good circus artist Thomas Hewitt Edward Cat in a short-lived detective series called &quot;T.H.E. Cat&quot;, first broadcast in 1966. At first, &quot;T.H.E. Cat&quot; appeared to be a success, Loggia said: &quot;We&#x27;re drawing about a 30 per cent share of the audience, which NBC considers fine for a new show with a new star.&quot; After NBC cancelled the series when viewing figures failed to deliver, Loggia went into a mid-life crisis—a &quot;Dante-esque descent into the inferno&quot;, as he called it later. For six years his career foundered, and his marriage fell apart. Restless and unnerved, constantly riddled with self-doubt, a chance meeting with Audrey O&#x27;Brien was his saving grace. She helped him out of the crisis, and they later married. Despite playing Frank Carver on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; in 1972, he took a new course when he decided to begin a career in directing.

The director Blake Edwards often cast Loggia in his films in minor or supporting roles. These included &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot; (1978) and other Pink Panther sequels, and &quot;S.O.B.&quot; (1981), which was a satire about Hollywood.

In 1983, Loggia played Frank Lopez, a drug dealer who was one of the main supporting characters and antagonists in the film &quot;Scarface&quot;, which is often considered a classic Hollywood film.

Loggia also acted in several widely acclaimed films such as &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; (1982), &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; (1985), and &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996). Other films starring Loggia include &quot;Over The Top&quot; (1987), &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot; (1991), and &quot;Return to Me&quot; (2000).

Loggia was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of crusty private detective Sam Ransom in the crime thriller &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; (1985). He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, his first such honor, for portraying FBI agent Nick Mancuso in the TV series &quot;Mancuso, FBI&quot; (1989–1990), a follow-up to the previous year&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Favorite Son&quot; (1988). Loggia appeared as a mobster in multiple films, including Bill Sykes, the immoral loanshark and shipyard agent in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988), Salvatore &quot;The Shark&quot; Macelli in John Landis&#x27; &quot;Innocent Blood&quot; (1992), Mr. Eddy in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997), and Don Vito Leoni in David Jablin&#x27;s &quot;The Don&#x27;s Analyst&quot; (1997). Additionally, he played violent mobster Feech La Manna in several episodes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. 
In 1998, Loggia appeared in a television commercial lampooning obscure celebrity endorsements. In it, a young boy names Loggia as someone he would trust to recommend Minute Maid orange-tangerine blend. Loggia instantly appears and endorses the drink, to which the boy exclaims, &quot;Whoa, Robert Loggia!&quot; The commercial was later referenced in a &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; episode in which Loggia made a guest appearance as &quot;Grandpa Victor&quot; (for which he received his second Emmy nomination); in it, Loggia drinks some orange juice, then spits it out and complains about the presence of pulp.

In addition to voicing Sykes in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, Loggia had several other voice acting roles, in multiple media, including: Admiral Petrarch in the computer game &quot;FreeSpace 2&quot; (1999) and the anime movie &quot;The Dog of Flanders&quot; (1997), crooked cop Ray Machowski in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; (2001), and a recurring role on the Adult Swim animated TV comedy series &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot; (2004–2006).

In August 2009, Loggia appeared in one of Apple&#x27;s &quot;Get a Mac&quot; advertisements. The advertisement features Loggia as a personal trainer hired by PC to get him back on top of his game. On October 26, 2009, TVGuide.com announced Loggia had joined the cast of the TNT series &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot;.

Loggia also appeared in two episodes of the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot; as himself; in the episode &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;, after Mayor West tells his fiancé Carol he has &quot;aides&quot; (which Carol mistakes for AIDS), before he clarifies that he is referring to his assistants; West then remarks that they both have AIDS, and the scene cuts to Loggia, angrily responding &quot;NOT OKAY!&quot;. In the episode &quot;Call Girl&quot;, he is seen twice denoting the passage of time in boring events. The script would cut away to Loggia saying &quot;Eight f***ing hours later&quot;, then back to the story, further along in the plot. An earlier episode showed Peter stuck behind Loggia at the airport, where he was not voiced by Loggia himself. In 2012, Loggia portrayed Saint Peter during his final imprisonment in &quot;The Apostle Peter and the Last Supper&quot;. Loggia partnered with Canadian entrepreneur Frank D&#x27;Angelo from 2013, appearing in three films (&quot;Real Gangsters&quot;, &quot;The Big Fat Stone&quot;, and &quot;No Depo$it&quot;), with a fourth film in production (&quot;Sicilian Vampire&quot;) at the time of Loggia&#x27;s death.

Loggia served as a director for episodes of &quot;Quincy M.E.&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;.

Loggia reprised his role from &quot;Independence Day&quot;, General William Grey, in a cameo appearance alongside his wife, Audrey, in the 2016 sequel &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot;, filmed shortly before his death. The film was released posthumously and dedicated to him.

==Personal life==

Loggia was married to Della Marjorie Sloan, from 1954 until they divorced in 1981, with whom he had three children. In 1982, Loggia married Audrey O&#x27;Brien; they remained married until his death in 2015.

== Illness and death ==
In 2010, Loggia was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on December 4, 2015, due to complications from the disease, at his home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, at the age of 85. He is interred at the Westwood Memorial Park.

==Honors and recognitions==
In 2010, Loggia was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of his humanitarian efforts.

On December 17, 2011, Loggia was honored by his alma mater, the University of Missouri, with an honorary degree for his career and his humanitarian efforts.

<doc id="584220" wikidata="Q647958" url="?curid=584220" title="Ironbridge Gorge">
<text>The Ironbridge Gorge is a deep gorge, containing the River Severn in Shropshire, England. It was first formed by a glacial overflow from the long drained away Lake Lapworth, at the end of the last ice age. The deep exposure of the rocks cut through by the gorge exposed commercial deposits of coal, iron ore, limestone and fireclay, which enabled the rapid economic development of the area during the early Industrial Revolution.

Originally called the Severn Gorge, the gorge now takes its name from its famous Iron Bridge, the first iron bridge of its kind in the world, and a monument to the industry that began there. The bridge was built in 1779 to link the industrial town of Broseley with the smaller mining town of Madeley and the growing industrial centre of Coalbrookdale.

There are two reasons the site was so useful to the early industrialists. The raw materials, coal, iron ore, limestone and clay, for the manufacture of iron, tiles and porcelain are exposed or easily mined in the gorge. The deep and wide river allowed easy transport of products to the sea at Bristol Channel.

==Formation==
The gorge carries the River Severn south towards the Bristol Channel. It was formed during the last ice age when the water from the previously north-flowing river became trapped in a lake (Lake Lapworth) created when the Irish Sea ice sheet dammed the river. The lake level rose until the water flowed through the hills to the south. This flow eroded a path through the hills, forming the gorge and permanently diverting the Severn southwards.

==The Gorge parish==
The Gorge is a civil parish within the borough of Telford and Wrekin and the ceremonial county of Shropshire. It covers the part of Ironbridge Gorge that falls within the Telford and Wrekin Council Unitary Authority area and includes the settlements of Coalbrookdale, Coalport, Ironbridge, Jackfield and Lightmoor, but not Buildwas or Broseley which are in the Shropshire Council Unitary Authority area. It is divided into three parish wards: Coalport &amp; Jackfield (2 councillors), Ironbridge Gorge (3 councillors) and Lightmoor (3 councillors). The Gorge Parish Council has its offices and holds its meetings at the Maws Craft Centre in Jackfield.

The population of this civil parish at the 2011 census was 3,275.

Women in the Ironbridge Gorge ward had the third lowest life expectancy at birth, 74 years, of any ward in England and Wales in 2016.

==Conservation in the Gorge==
Green Wood Centre has spent over twenty years training new coppice and woodland workers, with the aim of reviving the coppicing industry.

Severn Gorge Countryside Trust manages most of the woodland, grassland and other countryside within the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage Site, around in all. BTCV&#x27;s Green Gym works with the trust to assist them on woodland work.

Severn Gorge Countryside Trust and The Green Wood Centre run a joint volunteer project enabling local people to engage locally in activities such as coppicing, scrub removal, deer fencing, step building and woodland management.

<doc id="584224" wikidata="Q3059000" url="?curid=584224" title="Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics">
<text>[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]&#x27;s [[aesthetics]] result from his philosophical doctrine of the primacy of the metaphysical Will as the Kantian &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;, the ground of life and all being. In his chief work, &quot;The World as Will and Representation,&quot; Schopenhauer thought that if consciousness or attention is fully engrossed, absorbed, or occupied with the world as painless representations or images, then there is no consciousness of the world as painful willing. Aesthetic contemplation of a work of art provides just such a state—a temporary liberation from the suffering that results from enslavement to the will [need, craving, urge, striving] by becoming a will-less spectator of &quot;the world as representation&quot; [mental image or idea]. Art, according to Schopenhauer, also provides essential knowledge of the world&#x27;s objects in a way that is more profound than science or everyday experience.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetic theory is introduced in Book 3 of &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, Vol. 1, and developed in essays in the second volume. He provides an explanation of the beautiful (German: &quot;Schönheit&quot;) and the sublime (&quot;Das Erhabene&quot;), a hierarchy among the arts (from architecture, landscape gardening, sculpture and painting, poetry, etc. all the way to music, the pinnacle of the arts since it is a direct expression of the will), and the nature of artistic genius.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetic philosophy influenced artists and thinkers including composers Richard Wagner and Arnold Schoenberg, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and writers associated with the Symbolist movement (Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Stéphane Mallarmé, etc.)

==An extension of his philosophy==

For Schopenhauer, the Will is an aimless desire to perpetuate itself, the basis of life. Desire engendered by the Will is the source of all the sorrow in the world; each satisfied desire leaves us either with boredom, or with some new desire to take its place. A world in thrall to Will is necessarily a world of suffering. Since the Will is the source of life, and our very bodies are stamped with its image and designed to serve its purpose, the human intellect is, in Schopenhauer&#x27;s simile, like a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulders of a blind giant.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetics is an attempt to break out of the pessimism that naturally comes from this world view. Schopenhauer believed that what distinguished &quot;aesthetic experiences&quot; from other experiences is that contemplation of the object of aesthetic appreciation temporarily allowed the subject a respite from the strife of desire, and allowed the subject to enter a realm of purely mental enjoyment, the world purely as representation or mental image. The more a person&#x27;s mind is concerned with the world as representation, the less it feels the suffering of the world as will. Schopenhauer analysed art from its effects, both on the personality of the artist, and the personality of the viewer.

He believed that what gives arts such as literature and sculpture their value was the extent to which they incorporated pure perceptions. But, being concerned with human forms (at least in Schopenhauer&#x27;s day) and human emotions, these art forms were inferior to music, which being a direct manifestation of will, was to Schopenhauer&#x27;s mind the highest form of art. Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy of music was influential in the works of Richard Wagner. Wagner was an enthusiastic reader of Schopenhauer, and recommended the reading of Schopenhauer to his friends. His published works on music theory changed over time, and became more aligned with Schopenhauer&#x27;s thought, over the course of his life. Schopenhauer had stated that music was more important than libretto in opera. Music is, according to Schopenhauer, an immediate expression of will, the basic reality of the experienced world. Libretto is merely a linguistic representation of transient phenomena. Wagner emphasized music over libretto in his later works after reading Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetic doctrine.

==The Schopenhauerian artistic genius==
Schopenhauer believed that while all people were in thrall to the Will, the quality and intensity of their subjection differed:

:Only through the pure contemplation . . . which becomes absorbed entirely in the object, are the Ideas comprehended; and the nature of &quot;genius&quot; consists precisely in the preëminent ability for such contemplation. . . . (T)his demands a complete forgetting of our own person.

The aesthetic experience temporarily emancipates the subject from the Will&#x27;s domination and raises them to a level of pure perception. &quot;On the occurrence of an aesthetic appreciation, the will thereby vanishes entirely from consciousness.&quot; Genuine art cannot be created by anyone who merely follows standard artistic rules. A genius is required, that is, a person who creates original art without concern for rules. The personality of the artist was also supposed to be less subject to Will than most: such a person was a Schopenhauerian genius, a person whose exceptional predominance of intellect over Will made them relatively aloof from earthly cares and concerns. The poet living in a garret, the absent-minded professor, Vincent van Gogh struggling with madness, are all (at least in the popular mind) examples of Schopenhauer&#x27;s geniuses: so fixed on their art that they neglect the &quot;business of life&quot; that in Schopenhauer&#x27;s mind meant only the domination of the evil and painful Will. For Schopenhauer, the relative lack of competence of the artist and the thinker for practical pursuits was no mere stereotype: it was cause and effect.

In proposing that art could offer deliverance from the Will, Schopenhauer elevated art from mere artisanry or decoration, and held that art potentially offered temporary deliverance from the aimless strife of the Will in nature. In effect, Schopenhauer turned art into a substitute religion by offering a doctrine of salvation through aesthetic experiences. Artists were not merely skilled hands; they were priests or prophets of this doctrine. This teaching goes far to explain Schopenhauer&#x27;s appeal to members of the creative communities over the second half of the nineteenth century. His doctrine of aesthetics justified artistic work as a matter of highest importance in human society.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetics remain influential today, and are perhaps the most lasting part of his philosophy. Their appeal to later generations of Romantics, and to all schools of bohemianism, is demonstrated. Wagner sent Schopenhauer a note expressing deep gratitude for Schopenhauer&#x27;s discussion of music. Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy in general left a deep impression on a number of important writers, especially Thomas Hardy, Marcel Proust, Stéphane Mallarmé, Thomas Mann, Ivan Turgenev and Samuel Beckett.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetics were directly responsible for the rise of the Symbolists and their allied movements, and to the general development of the concept of art for art&#x27;s sake. It deeply influenced the aesthetics of Friedrich Nietzsche, although he ultimately rejected Schopenhauer&#x27;s conception of Will as evil, whose famous opposition of the Apollonian and Dionysian is a translation of Schopenhauer&#x27;s opposition of intellect against will in terms of Greek mythology. When the Marxist critique of capitalism was stirred into the aesthetic stew, Schopenhauer&#x27;s essentially ascetic view of the purpose of art laid the foundation for the opposition of kitsch versus the avant-garde which is found in such critics as Clement Greenberg. Contemporary beliefs that artistic creation should not be swayed by financial gains or the demands of patrons or customers, and the belief that the greatest artists are those who create new and entirely unprecedented forms of expression, rather than those who develop already existing forms, all owe a great deal to the influence of Schopenhauer.

Santayana praised Schopenhauer&#x27;s doctrine that tragedy benefited audiences because it helped them to deny the will–to–live and to turn away from life. &quot;He [Schopenhauer] thought tragedy beautiful because it detached us from a
troubled world and did not think a troubled world
good, as those unspeakable optimists did, because it
made such a fine tragedy. It is pleasant to find
that among all these philosophers one at least was
a gentleman.&quot;

==Quotations==
&quot;...things are certainly beautiful to &quot;behold&quot;, but to &quot;be&quot; them is something quite different.&quot; (&quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, Vol. II, Ch. XLVI)

&quot;...aesthetic pleasure in the beautiful consists, to a large extent, in the fact that, when we enter the state of pure contemplation, we are raised for the moment above all willing, above all desires and cares; we are, so to speak, rid of ourselves.&quot; (&quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, Vol. I, § 68)

&quot;Perhaps the reason why common objects in &quot;still life&quot; seem so transfigured and generally everything &quot;painted&quot; appears in a supernatural light is that we then no longer look at things in the flux of time and in the connection of cause and effect ... On the contrary, we are snatched out of that eternal flux of all things and removed into a dead and silent eternity. In its individuality the thing itself was determined by time and by the [causal] conditions of the understanding; here we see this connection abolished and only the &quot;Platonic Idea&quot; is left.&quot; (&quot;Manuscript Remains&quot;, Vol. I, § 80)

<doc id="584237" wikidata="Q544936" url="?curid=584237" title="Battle of Ferrybridge">
<text>The Battle of Ferrybridge, 28 March 1461, was a preliminary engagement between the houses of York and Lancaster before the larger battle of Towton, during the period now known as the Wars of the Roses.

==Background==
After proclaiming himself king, Edward IV gathered together a large force and marched north towards the Lancastrian position behind the Aire River in Yorkshire.
On 27 March the Earl of Warwick (leading the vanguard) forged a crossing at Ferrybridge, bridging the gaps (the Lancastrians having previously destroyed it) with planks. In the process he lost many men, both to the freezing winter water and to the frequent hail of arrows coming from a small but determined Lancastrian force on the other side. Once the crossing was managed and the Lancastrians seen off, Warwick had his men repair the bridge while camp was established on the north side of the river.

==Battle==
Early next morning the Yorkists were ambushed by a large party of Lancastrians under Lord Clifford and John, Lord Neville, a younger brother of the 2nd Earl of Westmorland (Warwick&#x27;s first cousins of the half blood). Completely surprised and confused Warwick&#x27;s forces suffered many losses. Warwick&#x27;s second-in-command at camp, Lord FitzWalter was mortally wounded while trying to rally his men (he died a week later). The Bastard of Salisbury, Warwick&#x27;s half-brother, was slain and in the process of retreating the Earl of Warwick himself was injured, struck by an arrow in the leg. Jean de Wavrin states that nearly 3,000 men perished in the fighting.

==Aftermath==
After the battle Edward arrived with his main army and together Warwick and Edward returned to the bridge to find it in ruins. Warwick sent his uncle, Lord Fauconberg with the Yorkist cavalry upstream to where they crossed the ford at Castleford and pursued Lord Clifford. Fauconberg pursued Lord Clifford, his half grand nephew, in sight of the main Lancastrian army and defeated him after a fierce struggle. Clifford was killed by an arrow in the throat, having removed the piece of armour that should have protected this area of his body, most likely so he could more easily issue commands.

==Date==
Some doubt exists over what date the battle took place on due to the way the historical sources refer to the different times of the day. No contemporary source explicitly states that the battle took place on 28 March but refers to Palm Sunday eve which could refer to the morning before dawn on the 29th. Archaeology evidence indicates that the subsequent engagement near Dittingdale after crossing the river is too close to the location of the main battle at Towton to have been fought on a separate day. As the historical sources all agree that Lord Clifford was killed on the same day as the engagement at Ferrybridge, a new interpretation has been given of there being 3 consecutive engagements in one day – starting before dawn on 29 March and ending at Towton. If this is the case it has been suggested the quoted casualty figures given for the battle of Towton may include those killed at Ferrybridge.

<doc id="584238" wikidata="Q631768" url="?curid=584238" title="Cladogenesis">
<text>Cladogenesis is an evolutionary splitting of a parent species into two distinct species, forming a clade.

This event usually occurs when a few organisms end up in new, often distant areas or when environmental changes cause several extinctions, opening up ecological niches for the survivors and causing population bottlenecks and founder effects changing allele frequencies of diverging populations compared to their ancestral population. The events that cause these species to originally separate from each other over distant areas may still allow both of the species to have equal chances of surviving, reproducing, and even evolving to better suit their environments while still being two distinct species due to subsequent natural selection, mutations and genetic drift.

Cladogenesis is in contrast to anagenesis, in which an ancestral species gradually accumulates change, and eventually, when enough is accumulated, the species is sufficiently distinct and different enough from its original starting form that it can be labeled as a new form - a new species. With anagenesis, the lineage in a phylogenetic tree does not split.

To determine whether a speciation event is cladogenesis or anagenesis, researchers may use simulation, evidence from fossils, molecular evidence from the DNA of different living species, or modelling. It has however been debated whether the distinction between cladogenesis and anagenesis is necessary at all in evolutionary theory.

<text>An image intensifier or image intensifier tube is a vacuum tube device for increasing the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray image intensifier), or for conversion of non-visible light sources, such as near-infrared or short wave infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a microchannel plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night-vision goggles.

==Introduction==
Image intensifier tubes (IITs) are optoelectronic devices that allow many devices, such as night vision devices and medical imaging devices, to function. They convert low levels of light from various wavelengths into visible quantities of light at a single wavelength.

==Operation==

Image intensifiers convert low levels of light photons into electrons, amplify those electrons, and then convert the electrons back into photons of light. Photons from a low-light source enter an objective lens which focuses an image into a photocathode. The photocathode releases electrons via the photoelectric effect as the incoming photons hit it. The electrons are accelerated through a high-voltage potential into a microchannel plate (MCP). Each high-energy electron that strikes the MCP causes the release of many electrons from the MCP in a process called secondary cascaded emission. The MCP is made up of thousands of tiny conductive channels, tilted at an angle away from normal to encourage more electron collisions and thus enhance the emission of secondary electrons in a controlled Electron avalanche.

All the electrons move in a straight line due to the high-voltage difference across the plates, which preserves collimation, and where one or two electrons entered, thousands may emerge. A separate (lower) charge differential accelerates the secondary electrons from the MCP until they hit a phosphor screen at the other end of the intensifier, which releases a photon for every electron. The image on the phosphor screen is focused by an eyepiece lens. The amplification occurs at the microchannel plate stage via its secondary cascaded emission. The phosphor is usually green because the human eye is more sensitive to green than other colors and because historically the original material used to produce phosphor screens produced green light (hence the soldiers&#x27; nickname &#x27;green TV&#x27; for image intensification devices).

==History==
The development of image intensifier tubes began during the 20th century, with continuous development since inception.

===Pioneering work===
The idea of an image tube was first proposed by G. Holst and H. De Boer in 1928, in the Netherlands , but early attempts to create one were not successful. It was not until 1934 that Holst, working for Philips, created the first successful infrared converter tube. This tube consisted of a photocathode in proximity to a fluorescent screen. Using a simple lens, an image was focused on the photocathode and a potential difference of several thousand volts was maintained across the tube, causing electrons dislodged from the photocathode by photons to strike the fluorescent screen. This caused the screen to light up with the image of the object focused onto the screen, however the image was non-inverting. With this image converter type tube, it was possible to view infrared light in real time, for the first time.

===Generation 0: early infrared electro-optical image converters===
Development continued in the US as well during the 1930s and mid-1930, the first inverting image intensifier was developed at RCA. This tube used an electrostatic inverter to focus an image from a spherical cathode onto a spherical screen. (The choice of spheres was to reduce off-axial aberrations.) Subsequent development of this technology led directly to the first Generation 0 image intensifiers which were used by the military during World War II to allow vision at night with infrared lighting for both shooting and personal night vision. The first military night vision device was introduced by the German army as early as 1939, developed since 1935. Early night vision devices based on these technologies were used by both sides in World War II. 

Unlike later technologies, early Generation 0 night vision devices were unable to significantly amplify the available ambient light and so, to be useful, required an infrared source. These devices used an S1 photocathode or &quot;silver-oxygen-caesium&quot; photocathode, discovered in 1930, which had a sensitivity of around 60 μA/lm (Microampere per Lumen) and a quantum efficiency of around 1% in the ultraviolet region and around 0.5% in the infrared region. Of note, the S1 photocathode had sensitivity peaks in both the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum and with sensitivity over 950 nm was the only photocathode material that could be used to view infrared light above 950 nm.

===Solar blind converters===
Solar blind converters, also known as solar blind photocathodes, are specialized devices that detect ultraviolet (UV) light below 280 nanometers (nm) in wavelength. This UV range is termed &quot;solar blind&quot; because it is shorter than the wavelengths of sunlight that typically penetrate the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Discovered in 1953 by Taft and Apker , solar blind photocathodes were initially developed using cesium telluride. Unlike night-vision technologies that are classified into &quot;generations&quot; based on their military applications, solar blind photocathodes do not fit into this categorization because their utility is not primarily military. Their ability to detect UV light in the solar blind range makes them useful for applications that require sensitivity to UV radiation without interference from visible sunlight.

===Generation 1: significant amplification===
With the discovery of more effective photocathode materials, which increased in both sensitivity and quantum efficiency, it became possible to achieve significant levels of gain over Generation 0 devices. In 1936, the S-11 cathode (cesium-antimony) was discovered by Gorlich, which provided sensitivity of approximately 80 μA/lm with a quantum efficiency of around 20%; this only included sensitivity in the visible region with a threshold wavelength of approximately 650 nm.

It was not until the development of the bialkali antimonide photocathodes (potassium-cesium-antimony and sodium-potassium-antimony) discovered by A.H. Sommer and his later multialkali photocathode (sodium-potassium-antimony-cesium) S20 photocathode discovered in 1956 by accident, that the tubes had both suitable infrared sensitivity and visible spectrum amplification to be useful militarily. The S20 photocathode has a sensitivity of around 150 to 200 μA/lm. The additional sensitivity made these tubes usable with limited light, such as moonlight, while still being suitable for use with low-level infrared illumination.

===Cascade (passive) image intensifier tubes===
Although originally experimented with by the Germans in World War Two, it was not until the 1950s that the U.S. began conducting early experiments using multiple tubes in a &quot;cascade&quot;, by coupling the output of an inverting tube to the input of another tube, which allowed for increased amplification of the object light being viewed. These experiments worked far better than expected and night vision devices based on these tubes were able to pick up faint starlight and produce a usable image. However, the size of these tubes, at 17 in (43 cm) long and 3.5 in (8.9 cm) in diameter, were too large to be suitable for military use. Known as &quot;cascade&quot; tubes, they provided the capability to produce the first truly passive night vision scopes. With the advent of fiber optic bundles in the 1960s, it was possible to connect smaller tubes together, which allowed for the first true Starlight scopes to be developed in 1964. Many of these tubes were used in the AN/PVS-2 rifle scope, which saw use in Vietnam.

An alternative to the cascade tube explored in the mid 20th century involves optical feedback, with the output of the tube fed back into the input. This scheme has not been used in rifle scopes, but it has been used successfully in lab applications where larger image intensifier assemblies are acceptable.

===Generation 2: micro-channel plate===
Second generation image intensifiers use the same multialkali photocathode that the first generation tubes used, however by using thicker layers of the same materials, the S25 photocathode was developed, which provides extended red response and reduced blue response, making it more suitable for military applications. It has a typical sensitivity of around 230 μA/lm and a higher quantum efficiency than S20 photocathode material. Oxidation of the cesium to cesium oxide in later versions improved the sensitivity in a similar way to third generation photocathodes. The same technology that produced the fiber optic bundles that allowed the creation of cascade tubes, allowed, with a slight change in manufacturing, the production of micro-channel plates, or MCPs. The micro-channel plate is a thin glass wafer with a Nichrome electrode on either side across which a large potential difference of up to 1,000 volts is applied.

The wafer is manufactured from many thousands of individual hollow glass fibers, aligned at a &quot;bias&quot; angle to the axis of the tube. The micro-channel plate fits between the photocathode and screen. Electrons that strike the side of the &quot;micro-channel&quot; as they pass through it elicit secondary electrons, which in turn elicit additional electrons as they too strike the walls, amplifying the signal. By using the MCP with a proximity focused tube, amplifications of up to 30,000 times with a single MCP layer were possible. By increasing the number of layers of MCP, additional amplification to well over 1,000,000 times could be achieved.

Inversion of Generation 2 devices was achieved through one of two different ways. The Inverter tube uses electrostatic inversion, in the same manner as the first generation tubes did, with a MCP included. Proximity focused second generation tubes could also be inverted by using a fiber bundle with a 180 degree twist in it.

===Generation 3: high sensitivity and improved frequency response===

While the third generation of tubes were fundamentally the same as the second generation, they possessed two significant differences. Firstly, they used a GaAs—CsO—AlGaAs photocathode, which is more sensitive in the 800 nm-900 nm range than second-generation photocathodes. Secondly, the photocathode exhibits negative electron affinity (NEA), which provides photoelectrons that are excited to the conduction band a free ride to the vacuum band as the Cesium Oxide layer at the edge of the photocathode causes sufficient band-bending. This makes the photocathode very efficient at creating photoelectrons from photons. The Achilles heel of third generation photocathodes, however, is that they are seriously degraded by positive ion poisoning. Due to the high electrostatic field stresses in the tube, and the operation of the MicroChannel Plate, this led to the failure of the photocathode within a short period - as little as 100 hours before photocathode sensitivity dropped below Gen2 levels. To protect the photocathode from positive ions and gases produced by the MCP, they introduced a thin film of sintered aluminium oxide attached to the MCP. The high sensitivity of this photocathode, greater than 900 μA/lm, allows more effective low light response, though this was offset by the thin film, which typically blocked up to 50% of electrons.

===Super second generation===
Although not formally recognized under the U.S. generation categories, Super Second Generation or SuperGen was developed in 1989 by Jacques Dupuy and Gerald Wolzak. This technology improved the tri-alkali photocathodes to more than double their sensitivity while also improving the microchannel plate by increasing the open-area ratio to 70% while reducing the noise level. This allowed second generation tubes, which are more economical to manufacture, to achieve comparable results to third generation image intensifier tubes. With sensitivities of the photocathodes approaching 700 μA/lm and extended frequency response to 950 nm, this technology continued to be developed outside of the U.S., notably by Photonis and now forms the basis for most non-US manufactured high-end night vision equipment.

===Generation 4===
In 1998, the US company Litton developed the filmless image tube. These tubes were originally made for the Omni V contract and resulted in significant interest by the US military. However, the tubes suffered greatly from fragility during testing and, by 2002, the NVESD revoked the fourth generation designation for filmless tubes, at which time they simply became known as Gen III Filmless. These tubes are still produced for specialist uses, such as aviation and special operations; however, they are not used for weapon-mounted purposes. To overcome the ion-poisoning problems, they improved scrubbing techniques during manufacture of the MCP ( the primary source of positive ions in a wafer tube ) and implemented autogating, discovering that a sufficient period of autogating would cause positive ions to be ejected from the photocathode before they could cause photocathode poisoning.

Generation III Filmless technology is still in production and use today, but officially, there is no Generation 4 of image intensifiers.

===Generation 3 thin film===
Also known as Generation 3 Omni VII and Generation 3+, following the issues experienced with generation IV technology, Thin Film technology became the standard for current image intensifier technology. In Thin Film image intensifiers, the thickness of the film is reduced from around 30 Angstrom (standard) to around 10 Angstrom and the photocathode voltage is lowered. This causes fewer electrons to be stopped than with third generation tubes, while providing the benefits of a filmed tube.

Generation 3 Thin Film technology is presently the standard for most image intensifiers used by the US military.

===4G===
In 2014, French image tube manufacturer PHOTONIS released the first global, open, performance specification; &quot;4G&quot;. The specification had four main requirements that an image intensifier tube would have to meet.

* Spectral sensitivity from below 400 nm to above 1000 nm
* A minimum figure-of-merit of FOM1800
* High light resolution higher than 57 lp/mm
* Halo size of less than 0.7mm

==Terminology==
There are several common terms used for Image Intensifier tubes.

===Gating===
Electronic Gating (or &#x27;gating&#x27;) is a means by which an image intensifier tube may be switched ON and OFF in a controlled manner. An electronically gated image intensifier tube functions like a camera shutter, allowing images to pass through when the electronic &quot;gate&quot; is enabled. The gating durations can be very short (nanoseconds or even picoseconds). This makes gated image intensifier tubes ideal candidates for use in research environments where very short duration events must be photographed. As an example, in order to assist engineers in designing more efficient combustion chambers, gated imaging tubes have been used to record very fast events such as the wavefront of burning fuel in an internal combustion engine.

Often gating is used to synchronize imaging tubes to events whose start cannot be controlled or predicted. In such an instance, the gating operation may be synchronized to the start of an event using &#x27;gating electronics&#x27;, e.g. high-speed digital delay generators. The gating electronics allows a user to specify when the tube will turn on and off relative to the start of an event.

There are many examples of the uses of gated imaging tubes. Because of the combination of the very high speeds at which a gated tube may operate and their light amplification capability, gated tubes can record specific portions of a beam of light. It is possible to capture only the portion of light &quot;reflected&quot; from a target, when a pulsed beam of light is fired at the target, by controlling the gating parameters. Gated-Pulsed-Active Night Vision (GPANV) devices are another example of an application that uses this technique. GPANV devices can allow a user to see objects of interest that are obscured behind vegetation, foliage, and/or mist. These devices are also useful for locating objects in deep water, where reflections of light off of nearby particles from a continuous light source, such as a high brightness underwater floodlight, would otherwise obscure the image.

===ATG (auto-gating)===
Auto-gating is a feature found in some image intensifier tubes. Auto-gated tubes rapidly shut off current to the photocathode and microchannel plate at a high frequency that is imperceptible to the user. By varying the duty cycle, it is possible to reduce the overall &quot;ON&quot; time of the image intensifier, while still presenting an image to the user. Auto-gating allows the tube to be operated during brighter conditions, for example when observing bright flashes on the battlefield, or in conditions of higher ambient light, while maintaining image resolution.
===Sensitivity===
The sensitivity of an image intensifier tube is measured in microamperes per lumen (μA/lm). It defines how many electrons are produced per quantity of light that falls on the photocathode. This measurement should be made at a specific color temperature, such as &quot;at a colour temperature of 2854 K&quot;. The color temperature at which this test is made tends to vary slightly between manufacturers. Additional measurements at specific wavelengths are usually also specified, especially for Gen2 devices, such as at 800 nm and 850 nm (infrared).

Typically, the higher the value, the more sensitive the tube is to light.

===Resolution===
More accurately known as limiting resolution, tube resolution is measured in line pairs per millimeter or lp/mm. This is a measure of how many lines of varying intensity (light to dark) can be resolved within a millimeter of screen area. However the limiting resolution itself is a measure of the Modulation Transfer Function. For most tubes, the limiting resolution is defined as the point at which the modulation transfer function becomes three percent or less. The higher the value, the higher the resolution of the tube.

An important consideration, however, is that this is based on the physical screen size in millimeters and is not proportional to the screen size. As such, an 18 mm tube with a resolution of around 64 lp/mm has a higher overall resolution than an 8 mm tube with 72 lp/mm resolution. Resolution is usually measured at the centre and at the edge of the screen and tubes often come with figures for both. Military Specification or milspec tubes only come with a criterion such as &quot;&gt; 64 lp/mm&quot; or &quot;Greater than 64 line pairs/millimeter&quot;.

===Gain===
The gain of a tube is typically measured using one of two units. The most common (SI) unit is cd·m−2·lx−1, i.e. candelas per meter squared per lux. The older convention is Fl/Fc (foot-lamberts per foot-candle). This creates issues with comparative gain measurements since neither is a pure ratio, although both are measured as a value of output intensity over input intensity. This creates ambiguity in the marketing of night vision devices as the difference between the two measurements is effectively pi or approximately 3.142x. This means that a gain of 10,000 cd/m2/lx is the same as 31.42 Fl/Fc.

===MTBF (mean time between failure)===
This value, expressed in hours, gives an idea how long a tube typically should last. It&#x27;s a reasonably common comparison point, however takes many factors into account. The first is that tubes are constantly degrading. This means that over time, the tube will slowly produce less gain than it did when it was new. When the tube gain reaches 50% of its &quot;new&quot; gain level, the tube is considered to have failed, so primarily this reflects this point in a tube&#x27;s life.

Additional considerations for the tube lifespan are the environment that the tube is being used in and the general level of illumination present in that environment, including bright moonlight and exposure to both artificial lighting and use during dusk/dawn periods, as exposure to brighter light reduces a tube&#x27;s life significantly.

Also, a MTBF only includes operational hours. It is considered that turning a tube on or off does not contribute to reducing overall lifespan, so many civilians tend to turn their night vision equipment on only when they need to, to make the most of the tube&#x27;s life. Military users tend to keep equipment on for longer periods of time, typically, the entire time while it is being used with batteries being the primary concern, not tube life.

Typical examples of tube life are:

First Generation: 1000 hrs&lt;br&gt;
Second Generation: 2000 to 2500 hrs&lt;br&gt;
Third Generation: 10000 to 15000 hrs.

Many recent high-end second-generation tubes now have MTBFs approaching 15,000 operational hours.

===MTF (modulation transfer function)===
The modulation transfer function of an image intensifier is a measure of the output amplitude of dark and light lines on the display for a given level of input from lines presented to the photocathode at different resolutions. It is usually given as a percentage at a given frequency (spacing) of light and dark lines. For example, if you look at white and black lines with a MTF of 99% @ 2 lp/mm then the output of the dark and light lines is going to be 99% as dark or light as looking at a black image or a white image. This value decreases for a given increase in resolution also. On the same tube if the MTF at 16 and 32 lp/mm was 50% and 3% then at 16 lp/mm the signal would be only half as bright/dark as the lines were for 2 lp/mm and at 32 lp/mm the image of the lines would be only three percent as bright/dark as the lines were at 2 lp/mm.

Additionally, since the limiting resolution is usually defined as the point at which the MTF is three percent or less, this would also be the maximum resolution of the tube. The MTF is affected by every part of an image intensifier tube&#x27;s operation and on a complete system is also affected by the quality of the optics involved. Factors that affect the MTF include transition through any fiber plate or glass, at the screen and the photocathode and also through the tube and the microchannel plate itself. The higher the MTF at a given resolution, the better.

<text>Game Over is an American adult animated sitcom created by David Sacks and produced by Carsey-Werner Productions. The series was broadcast on UPN in 2004, and was cancelled after five episodes. It was animated using computer animation.

&quot;Game Over&quot; (the title was inspired by the phrase &quot;game over&quot; that commonly concludes video games) focuses on what happens to video game characters after the game ends, and recounted the lives of the Smashenburns, a far-from-ordinary suburban family that lived in an alternate video game universe. The show made numerous references to video games and even featured certain game characters as cameos. For example, &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; appears on a Got Milk? billboard, and creatures from &quot;&quot; appear in one of the episodes.

Marisa Tomei voiced the character of Raquel Smashenburn in the series&#x27; unaired pilot episode, but scheduling problems saw Lucy Liu take over the role for the actual series.

&quot;Game Over&quot; was heavily hyped by UPN before its debut. It generally received positive press on its airing. Because of this, six episodes were produced and aired on a variety of different days – the fourth and fifth episodes were broadcast on April 2, 2004, with the sixth episode (&quot;Monkey Dearest&quot;) never aired and only appears on the complete series DVD.

==Characters==
* Rip Smashenburn (voiced by Patrick Warburton) is a Grand Prix driver who races every day and crashes his car all the time.
* Raquel Smashenburn (née Grunkmeyer) (voiced by Lucy Liu) is a covert agent who likes to fights monsters and is vaguely similar to Lara Croft.
* Alice Smashenburn (voiced by Rachel Dratch) is a cynical yet socially conscious 14-year-old girl in which she is part of a beach volleyball team. However, instead of wearing a bikini, she wears a hoodie.
* Billy Smashenburn (voiced by Elizabeth Daily) is a 13-year-old boy who is hoping to become a rapper.
* Turbo (voiced by Artie Lange) is a purple walrus-dog creature and the Smashenburn family&#x27;s talking 300-pound pet. Turbo robs pawn shops and smokes cigars, and shows an inclination towards teenage girls.
* The Changs are a family of Kung-Fu-fighting Shaolin monks who live next door, this includes Dark Princess Chang (voiced by Marie Matiko).
* Another Next door neighbor who talks to Rip in first person perspective

==Episodes==
==Home media==
Anchor Bay Entertainment released all six episodes of the series as &quot;Game Over: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in North America on June 28, 2005.

<doc id="584248" wikidata="Q3532861" url="?curid=584248" title="Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002">
<text>The Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA) was an Act passed by the Parliament of India by Atal Bihari Bajpayee government in 2002, with the objective of strengthening anti-terrorism operations. The Act was enacted due to several terrorist attacks that were being carried out in India and especially in response to the attack on the Parliament. The Act replaced the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance (POTO) of 2001 and the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) (1985–1995), and was supported by the governing National Democratic Alliance. The Act was repealed in 2004 by the United Progressive Alliance coalition.

The bill was defeated in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house) by a 113–98 vote, but was passed in a joint session (425 Ayes and 296 Noes), as the Lok Sabha (lower house) has more seats. It was only the third time that a bill was passed by a joint session of both houses of Indian Parliament.

The Act defined what constituted a &quot;terrorist act&quot; and who a &quot;terrorist&quot; was, and granted special powers to the investigating authorities described under the Act. In order to ensure that discretionary powers granted to the investigating agencies were not misused and human rights violations were not committed, specific safeguards were built into the Act.

==Provisions compared to TADA==
Similar to the provisions contained in TADA, the law provided that a suspect could be detained for up to 180 days without the filing of a chargesheet in court. However, a very major change was introduced, in that unlike TADA, this act had no provision to allow preventive detention.

Secondly, the matter of confessions made by the accused to the police. The general law in India does not recognise confessions made to police as evidence admissible in court, and permits a person to deny such confessions in court, but under POTA, confessions made to a police officer were admissible as evidence in court. POTA also allowed law enforcement agencies to withhold the identity of witnesses. Anti-Terrorism Day is celebrated on 21 May.

However, the POTA law did have some safeguards. Any decision on bail petitions or the verdict of the special courts constituted under this Act could be appealed against, and the appeal would be heard by a division bench of the relevant High Court.

==Review committee==
The provisions in the Act mentioned the possibility of both state and central review committees, but offered few details as to their formation or use. As the Act began to be widely misused by the state governments, the central government finally established a review committee to hear individual cases related to this Act. At first, the committee functioned in a purely advisory capacity.

In December 2003, by an overwhelming majority, India&#x27;s legislature amended the Act with an ordinance designed to expand the scope of judicial review. The new ordinance gave review commissions the authority to review the prima facie case of an &quot;aggrieved person&quot; and issue orders binding on the state government and police. Though the amendment was an improvement on the purely advisory capacity of the initial review committee because it enhanced the power of judicial review, the central review committee remained largely impotent, as it could not initiate an investigation absent an initial complaint and lacked clearly delineated investigatory powers. Moreover, the review committee&#x27;s resources were limited, and it operated under no regulated time-frame. Without sufficient autonomy, resources, or guidelines, the committee was an illusory safeguard.

Given the review committee&#x27;s limitations, only the grievances of those persons with political connections to the central government were likely to be heard. Further, even with political pressure from the central government and a favorable advisory opinion by the review committee, Tamil Nadu detained Vaiko for over four months without charge, and an additional fourteen months after charging him before granting bail.

== Impact and repeal ==
Once the Act came into force, many reports surfaced of the law being grossly abused. POTA was alleged to have been arbitrarily used to target political opponents. Only four months after its enactment, state law enforcement officers had arrested 250 people nationwide under the Act, and the number was steadily increasing. A mere eight months later, seven states where POTA was in force, had arrested over 940 people, at least 560 of whom were languishing in jail. Several prominent persons like Vaiko were arrested under the act.

The Act had a built-in expiry date three years after its commencement, vide section 1(6) of the Act. It had commenced on 24 October 2001, so was scheduled to expire on 24 October 2004. One month before its expiry, the Act was repealed on 21 September 2004 by the Prevention of Terrorism (Repeal) Ordinance, 2004, later substituted with the Prevention of Terrorism (Repeal) Act, 2004 (assented to on 21 December 2004). NDA asked UPA to introduce the Act again, but Congress criticized it and did not pass the Act.

== Prominent POTA cases ==

* Vaiko, founder and general secretary of the MDMK, was controversially arrested and jailed for 19 months under the POTA for his support to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
* S.A.R. Geelani, a lecturer at Delhi University, was sentenced to death by a special POTA court for his alleged role in the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament. He was later acquitted on appeal by the Delhi High Court on a legal technicality.
* Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Kashmiri nationalist and leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami group was arrested under POTA.
* Raghuraj Pratap Singh, a.k.a. Raja Bhaiya, a Member of the Legislative Assembly from Kunda, Uttar Pradesh was arrested on the charges of threatening a dissident BJP MLA Puran Singh Bundela with dire consequences. He was arrested the same night at 3:00 AM on orders of the then chief minister, Mayawati. He was sent to jail under POTA.

<text>Carry On Again Doctor is a 1969 British comedy film, the 18th release in the series of 31 &quot;Carry On&quot; films (1958–1992). It was released in December 1969 and was the third to feature a medical theme. The film features series regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Barbara Windsor and Hattie Jacques. This was Jim Dale&#x27;s last &quot;Carry On&quot; appearance for 23 years until his return in &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot;. It also marks the debut of Patsy Rowlands to the series in her first of 9 appearances. Alongside James, Rowlands who also appears in the ITV sitcom &quot;Bless This House&quot; from 1971 to 1976. The film was followed by &quot;Carry On Up the Jungle&quot; in 1970.

==Plot==
At the Long Hampton Hospital, Dr Jimmy Nookey seems to attract trouble, beginning with an incident where he enters the women&#x27;s washroom by mistake, frightening the highly-strung Miss Armitage out of her senses. Nookey&#x27;s carefree manner is not to everyone&#x27;s liking, with Dr. Stoppidge wanting Nookey sacked for the washroom incident. Accident-prone Nookey then quickly falls in love with a film star patient named Goldie Locks. During some misadventures with the X-ray machine, Nookey triggers a massive short circuit in the hospital&#x27;s electrical system, resulting in more mayhem. With the sympathetic Matron and his moody boss Dr. Frederick Carver now watching his every move, Dr. Nookey drinks, at a staff party, a fruit punch spiked by jealous Dr. Stoppidge. The drunk Nookey, after almost getting into bed with a patient, ends up on a hospital trolley which crashes through a window. Goldie leaves him because he is not interested in marriage. Meanwhile, Carver and his rich patient Ellen Moore, dispatch the disgraced Nookey to Moore&#x27;s medical mission in the Beatific Islands, where it rains for nine months of the year. Nookey discovers Gladstone Screwer, the local medicine man, who has a weight-loss serum. Nookey soon returns to England and opens a new surgery with Mrs. Moore, angering Carver. While Matron joins Dr. Nookey&#x27;s clinic, Carver and Stoppidge plot to try to steal the serum. Stoppidge dresses as a female patient to effect the theft, but his luck runs out when Nookey catches him in the act. Goldie returns to take the serum, much to Nookey&#x27;s chagrin. Gladstone quickly discovers that Nookey is making a fortune from his serum, and cuts off his supply to deliver the product in person and get in on the action. Nookey prevaricates, so Gladstone gives him a dose, which seems to cause sex changes. The movie ends with Nookey and Goldie getting married at the Moore-Nookey-Gladstone-Carver facility, and the rest of the staff of the Long Hampton Hospital becoming friends again.

==Production notes==
The original script for &quot;Carry On Again Doctor&quot; raised problems with Rank&#x27;s legal adviser, who felt it was too similar to an unfilmed &#x27;Doctor&#x27; script that Talbot Rothwell, writer of &quot;Carry On Again Doctor&quot;, had previously submitted to producer Betty Box. Most notably, both scenarios featured the medical mission/slimming potion idea. As Box had not taken up the option on Rothwell&#x27;s &#x27;Doctor&#x27; script, however, it was felt there were no legal problems with the use of those ideas in this film.

The opening bars of the title music are the same used for Carry On Camping. During the party scene, Eric Rogers plays &quot;Magic of Love&quot; (from Carry On Spying), &quot;Call Me a Cab&quot; (from Carry On Cabby) and a rumba score which was used in Carry On Abroad.

Eric Rogers arranges the theme from Steptoe and Son when Wilfrid Brambell appears, as he did with Harry H. Corbett in Carry On Screaming.

==Release==
When the film was released by American International Pictures in New York in February 1973, they released it under the title &quot;Carry on Doctor&quot;.

The sequence where Dr Nookie short circuits the hospital&#x27;s electrical system and the ensuing mayhem formed introduction to the 1980s compilation show &quot;Carry On Laughing&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Empire&quot; wrote &quot;The fast moving plot and changing locations keep the show moving, and makes this one of the more successful entries in the series.&quot;

<text>Carry On Behind is a 1975 British comedy film, the 27th release in the series of 31 &quot;Carry On&quot; films (1958–1992). It was the first entry in the series not to be scripted by Talbot Rothwell since &quot;Carry On Cruising&quot; 13 years previously. Also missing was series stalwart Sid James. James was busy touring in a play, while Rothwell&#x27;s health prevented him from writing. The regular actors present are Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor, Jack Douglas, Joan Sims and Peter Butterworth, Bernard Bresslaw and Patsy Rowlands. &quot;Carry On Behind&quot; was the final picture in the series for Bresslaw (in his 14th appearance), Liz Fraser (in her fourth) and Rowlands (in her ninth) as well as Carol Hawkins (in her second). It saw the only appearances of Elke Sommer, Adrienne Posta, Sherrie Hewson and Ian Lavender in a &quot;Carry On&quot; film, and was the first of two entries in the series for Windsor Davies. The film was followed by &quot;Carry On England&quot; 1976.

==Plot==
Frustrated butcher Fred Ramsden and his dim electrician friend Ernie Bragg happily head off for a holiday trip at the Riverside Caravan Site, while their respective wives Sylvia and Vera look forward to their health farm holiday. Once at the caravan site of Major Leap, Fred starts making eyes at two young female campers, Carol and Sandra. However, as Ernie talks in his sleep and any infidelities are likely to be spoken of in the marital bed after their holiday, Fred is despondent. Professor Roland Crump teams with Roman expert Anna Vrooshka in an archaeological dig at the site. Arthur Upmore and his wife Linda are saddled with her mother Daphne and her vulgar mynah bird. Arthur is caught in a compromising position with attractive blonde Norma Baxter whose husband Joe is lumbered with their giant Irish wolfhound.

After a few drinks with the amused pub landlord, Fred and Ernie discover that the caravan site is riddled with excavation holes. Daphne is perturbed by the discovery that her estranged husband Henry Barnes lives a downtrodden life as the camp&#x27;s odd-job man, despite having won the pools. Major Leap is determined to give the place a boost and arranges an evening cabaret for the caravanners, but a mix-up over the phone secures a stripper, Veronica, rather than the singer he wanted. Carol and Sandra having hooked up with archaeology students Bob and Clive, Fred and Ernie pick up Maureen and Sally, two beautiful young women from the village. Some wet paint, some glue, heavy rain that causes the tunnels of the dig to collapse, and the arrival of their wives soon bring their planned night of passion to a halt.

==Casting==
The main roles are played by &quot;Carry On&quot; regulars Kenneth Williams, Bernard Bresslaw, Peter Butterworth, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Jack Douglas and Patsy Rowlands. Newcomers to the series in major roles are Windsor Davies and Elke Sommer. Sims played the role of Rowlands&#x27;s mother, despite being only eight months older than her on-screen daughter.

Supporting roles are played by Sherrie Hewson, Carol Hawkins, Ian Lavender, Adrienne Posta, George Layton, Larry Dann, Larry Martyn and David Lodge. These supporting players were mostly recognisable comedy actors at the time, but not long-term regular members of the &quot;Carry On&quot; team. Liz Fraser had appeared in three early films in the series; her re-appearance here was after a gap of twelve years.

==Filming==
Chilly spring filming meant the bare trees, muddy fields and icy breath are all quite visible, although the setting is a summer caravanning holiday. A similar dilemma met the cast and crew in &quot;Carry On Camping&quot;. The signage in Fred Ramsden&#x27;s butcher&#x27;s shop clearly shows that the shop is closing for the Easter holidays, which can occur as early as March.

Whilst this film was in production, Bernard Bresslaw and Joan Sims also appeared in &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot;, another film being made at Pinewood Studios alongside &quot;Carry On Behind&quot;.

In 2023, actor Larry Dann dedicated a chapter of his autobiography &quot;Oh, What A Lovely Memoir&quot; to share his memories of the making of this production.

<doc id="584256" wikidata="Q2146384" url="?curid=584256" title="Carry On England">
<text>Carry On England is a 1976 British comedy film, the 28th release in the series of the original 30 &quot;Carry On&quot; films (1958–1978). It was released in October 1976 and featured &quot;Carry On&quot; regulars Kenneth Connor, Jack Douglas, Joan Sims and Peter Butterworth. It was the second and last &quot;Carry On&quot; film for Windsor Davies, Diane Langton and Peter Jones, as well as the fifth and last for Patricia Franklin and the eighth and last for Julian Holloway. Patrick Mower, Judy Geeson and Melvyn Hayes make their only appearances in a &quot;Carry On&quot; film. The film was followed by &quot;That&#x27;s Carry On!&quot; in 1977.

==Plot==
During the darkest days of the war Captain S Melly is put in charge of the experimental 1313 Anti-Aircraft Battery along with the bellowing, ball-squeezing Sergeant Major “Tiger” Bloomer. Melly soon discovers the “experiment” is that half his men are women, led by the randy Bombardier Ready, Sergeant Tilly Willing and Sergeant Len Able. Tiger is unable to discipline properly as he is unable to swear around women and must avoid the libidinous advances of Private Ffoukes-Sharpe. Meanwhile the battery are happy to spend the war in each other’s beds.

Melly shakes things up with a fake air raid and is furious when instead of loading the gun they dive for cover in their private bunker, the “Snoggery”. Even worse the anti-aircraft cannon is made of wood; with a war on, real guns are hard to come by.

Determined to get the battery up to standard Melly and Tiger put the men, and women, through vigorous retraining, violent exercise and 12 mile long route marches. In response Ready, Willing and Able sabotage Melly’s uniform, leaving him red faced and bare cheeked. The whole battery is confined to camp as punishment, Melly not realising that men and women in close quarters don’t need to leave camp to enjoy themselves. Realising his mistake Melly endeavours to separate man from woman with barbed wire around the sleeping quarters, round the clock battle drills and separate mealtimes.

Determined to reunite with their beloveds, the battery digs secret tunnels under the barbed wire for easy access, making life bearable again. Unfortunately the very next day Melly finally takes delivery of an anti-aircraft cannon, which promptly falls into the tunnel. Forced by Melly to retrieve the gun from its hole the battery sabotages an inspection by Melly’s Brigadier, hoping Melly will be reassigned somewhere else.

When a real air raid arrives both battery and officers pull together to defend England, successfully shooting down all enemy planes and with only one casualty: Captain Melly’s two sprained fingers, which go on to inspire one of the most famous symbols of victory for the entire war.

==Production==
This film featured few established members of the &quot;Carry On&quot; team. &quot;Carry On&quot; regular Kenneth Connor played a leading role, but the only other long-time regulars present, Joan Sims and Peter Butterworth, had only small supporting roles.

Windsor Davies, who had joined the series with a main role in the preceding film &quot;Carry On Behind&quot;, again plays a major role, reprising (in all but name) his Sergeant-Major character from the BBC sitcom &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;, along with Melvyn Hayes as his effeminate foil. Other main roles are played by established and recognisable actors Judy Geeson and Patrick Mower, both newcomers to the &quot;Carry On&quot; films.

The role of the Brigadier was written for series regular Kenneth Williams, and the role of Private Easy was written for series regular Barbara Windsor, but Williams was unavailable due to appearing in the stage play &quot;Signed and Sealed&quot;, and Windsor was unavailable due to appearing in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre.

Series regular Sid James was unavailable for the film due to appearing in the stage play &quot;The Mating Season&quot;. On the opening night of the play at Sunderland Empire Theatre on 26 April 1976, James suffered a heart attack on stage and died, at the age of 62.

In 2023, actor Larry Dann dedicated a chapter of his autobiography &quot;Oh, What A Lovely Memoir&quot; to share his memories of the making of this production.

The film was originally certified AA by the British Board of Film Censors which would have restricted audiences to those aged fourteen and over, but was cut down to the non-age limited A certificate by heavily toning down the scenes featuring topless nudity and removing one comedic use of the word &quot;fokker&quot;. However, it still proved to be a major commercial failure and was withdrawn from some cinemas after just three days.

<doc id="584259" wikidata="Q7176132" url="?curid=584259" title="Peter North (politician)">
<text>Peter John North (born August 23, 1960) is former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1999 who represented the southwestern Ontario riding of Elgin. He was a cabinet minister in the government of Bob Rae. In 1993 he left the New Democratic Party in an unsuccessful attempt to join the Progressive Conservative Party. For the next seven years he sat as an independent member.

He was the first MPP of First Nations descent ever elected to Ontario&#x27;s provincial legislature.

==Background==
North graduated from high school in 1979 and worked as a building contractor.

==Politics==

===New Democrat===
He was elected to the legislature in the 1990 Ontario election as the New Democratic Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Elgin, defeating incumbent Liberal Marietta Roberts by over 4,000 votes. As one of the few NDP MPPs to represent a rural constituency in southern Ontario, North was appointed to Bob Rae&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of Tourism and Recreation on October 1, 1990. He resigned as tourism minister in November 1992 after allegations he had offered a government job to a woman with whom he was having an unconsummated affair. An investigation by the Ontario Provincial Police found no evidence of wrongdoing, but North was not returned to cabinet by Rae.

===Cabinet positions===

===Independent===
North resigned from the NDP in August 1993 and declared his intention to join the Progressive Conservative Party. He did not discuss this with the party in advance, however, and was told that he would have to get the support of the riding association in Elgin before he would be accepted by the party. North then sat as an independent.

North was re-elected in the 1995 provincial election. Defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Jim Williams by nearly 2,000 votes, he became the first MPP in the province to be elected as an independent candidate since 1934. He had no formal legislative responsibilities from 1995 to 1997 and made only minor contributions to legislative debate.

North did not seek re-election in 1999, clearing the way for PC incumbent Bruce Smith to run (unsuccessfully) in the redistributed riding of Elgin—Middlesex—London. In July 1999, North was appointed co-ordinator of Community Sport and Recreation Development by the government.

===Failed Comeback===
North resumed his old career as a contractor based in Port Stanley, Ontario with one failed comeback attempt in 2011 as a PC nomination candidate for Elgin—Middlesex—London, but lost to Jeff Yurek who went on to become elected.

<text>Carry On at Your Convenience (also known as Carry On Round the Bend outside the UK) is a 1971 British comedy film, directed by Gerald Thomas and starring regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Hattie Jacques and Bernard Bresslaw and Kenneth Cope in the first of his two &quot;Carry On&quot; appearances. It was written by Talbot Rothwell and produced by Peter Rogers.

It was the 22nd release in the series of 31 &quot;Carry On&quot; films (1958–1992) and the first box office failure. This has been attributed to the film&#x27;s attempt at exploring the political themes of the trade union movement, portraying union activists as idle, pedantic buffoons, which apparently alienated the traditional working-class audience of the series. The film did not return full production costs until 1976 after several international and television sales. It was followed by &quot;Carry On Matron&quot; in 1972.

==Plot==
In bathroom ceramics factory W.C. Boggs &amp; Son, the traditionalist owner W.C. Boggs is having no end of trouble. Bolshy and lazy union representative Vic Spanner continually stirs up trouble in the works, to the irritation of his co-workers and management. He calls a strike for almost any minor incident – or because he wants time off to attend a local football match. Sid Plummer is the site foreman bridging the gap between workers and management, shrewdly keeping the place going amid the unrest.

Prissy floral-shirt-wearing product designer Charles Coote has included a bidet in his latest range of designs, but W.C. objects to the manufacture of such &quot;dubious&quot; items. W.C. will not change his stance even after his son, Lewis Boggs, secures a large overseas order for the bidets. It is a deal that could save the struggling firm, which W.C. has to admit is in debt to the banks.

Vic&#x27;s dim stooge Bernie Hulke provides bumbling assistance in both his union machinations and his attempts to woo Sid&#x27;s daughter, factory canteen worker Myrtle. She is torn between Vic and Lewis Boggs, who is something of a playboy but insists he loves her.

Sid&#x27;s wife is Beattie, a lazy housewife who does little but fuss over her pet budgie, Joey, which refuses to talk despite her intense efforts. Their neighbour is Sid&#x27;s brassy and lascivious co-worker Chloe Moore. Chloe contends with the endless strikes and with her crude husband, travelling salesman Fred, who neglects her and leaves her dissatisfied. Chloe and Sid enjoy a flirtatious relationship and are sorely tempted to stray. Unusually for Sid James, his character is a faithful husband, albeit a cheeky and borderline-lecherous one.

Sid and Beattie find that Joey can correctly predict winners of horseraces – he tweets when the horse&#x27;s name is read out. Sid bets on Joey&#x27;s tips and achieves several large wins – including a vital £1,000 loaned to W.C. when the banks refuse a bridging loan – before Benny, Sid&#x27;s bookie, fed up with having made these payouts, refuses to accept further bets, larger than £5, from him.

The strikers finally return to work, but it is only to attend the annual works outing, a coach trip to Brighton. A good time is had by all with barriers coming down between workers and management, thanks largely to that great social lubricant, alcohol. W.C. becomes intoxicated and spends the day – and, it appears, the night – with his faithful, adoring secretary, Miss Hortense Withering. Lewis Boggs manages to win Myrtle from Vic Spanner, giving his rival a beating, and the couple elope. After arriving home late after the outing and with Fred away, Chloe invites Sid in for a cup of tea. They fight their desires and ultimately decide not to have the tea, fearing that neighbours might see Sid enter Chloe&#x27;s home and get the wrong idea.

At the picket lines the next day, Vic gets his comeuppance – partly at the hands of his mother, who spanks him in public – and the workers and management all pull together to produce the big order to save the firm.

==Production notes==
After Sid James&#x27;s character was criticised for leering at some girls in &quot;Carry On Henry&quot; (1971), here his character was changed to the put-upon family man similar to the character he portrayed in the TV sitcom &quot;Bless This House&quot;. In the next film &quot;Carry On Matron&quot; (1972), his character was preoccupied with thieving, but made odd suggestive comments to nurses (including one played by Jacki Piper, who played his daughter in this film). James&#x27;s girl-chasing persona was fully reinstated for subsequent films.

==Reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Twenty one &quot;Carry On...&quot; films have understandably exhausted the supply of lavatorial puns, and though the twenty-second does not scruple about re-using several of them, Talbot Rothwell tends generally to neglect his W.C. factory (a thinly disguised Pinewood Studios) for a series of irrelevant sketches ranging from farce (the works outing) to domestic comedy (Sid and the budgie). The result seems even more scrappily assembled than usual and, with the exception of a fairly amusing parody of sex education films, the level of humour, though noticeably cleaner than of late, is still rock bottom.&quot;

<doc id="584263" wikidata="Q4494372" url="?curid=584263" title="Mary Sue Hubbard">
<text>Mary Sue Hubbard (née Whipp; June 17, 1931 – November 25, 2002) was the third wife of L. Ron Hubbard, from 1952 until his death in 1986. She was a leading figure in Scientology for much of her life. The Hubbards had four children: Diana (born 1952), Quentin (1954–1976), Suzette (born 1955), and Arthur (born 1958).

She became involved in Hubbard&#x27;s Dianetics in 1951, while still a student at the University of Texas at Austin, becoming a Dianetics auditor. She soon became involved in a relationship with Hubbard and married him in March 1952. She accompanied her husband to Phoenix, Arizona, where they established the Hubbard Association of Scientologists – the forerunner of the Church of Scientology, which was itself founded in 1953. She was credited with helping to coin the word &quot;Scientology&quot;, going on to play a leading role in the management of the Church of Scientology and rising to become the head of the Church&#x27;s Guardian&#x27;s Office (GO). In August 1978, she was indicted by the United States government on charges of conspiracy relating to illegal covert operations mounted by the Guardian&#x27;s Office against government agencies. She was convicted in December 1979 and was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment and the payment of a $10,000 fine. She was forced to resign her post in 1981 and served a year in prison in 1983, after exhausting her appeals against her conviction. 

In the late 1990s, Hubbard fell ill with breast cancer and died in 2002.

==Early life and involvement in Dianetics==
Mary Sue Whipp was born in Rockdale, Texas, to Harry Hughes Whipp (Sept 2, 1893 – Oct 30, 1942) and Mary Catherine (née Hill) Whipp. She grew up in Houston, where she attended Rice University for a year before moving on to the University of Texas at Austin, from which she graduated as a Bachelor of Arts. She originally intended to work in petroleum research, but a friend persuaded her to travel with him to Wichita, Kansas, in mid-1951 to take a Dianetics course at the Hubbard Dianetic Foundation. She soon began an affair with Hubbard, who had just been divorced from his second wife Sara, and moved in with him within a few weeks of arriving in Wichita. She obtained a Hubbard Dianetic Auditor&#x27;s Certificate and joined the Foundation&#x27;s staff.

She became pregnant in February 1952, and married Hubbard the next month. By this time, the Foundation had filed for bankruptcy, and Hubbard&#x27;s erstwhile backer, Don Purcell, was left to deal with its substantial debts. A bitter dispute broke out between the men over the ownership of the Foundation&#x27;s remaining assets, with Hubbard resigning to start a rival &quot;Hubbard College&quot; on the other side of Wichita. Mary Sue was given partial responsibility for running the new Dianetics establishment. After six weeks of operation, it was replaced in April 1952 by the Hubbard Association of Scientologists, established in Phoenix, Arizona, to promote Hubbard&#x27;s newly announced &quot;science of certainty&quot;.

==The establishment and expansion of Scientology==
The Hubbards traveled to England in September 1952 when Mary Sue was eight months pregnant. According to the Church of Scientology, the reason for the trip was that &quot;amid the constant violence of the turncoat Don J. Purcell of Wichita and his suits which attempted to seize Scientology, Mary Sue became ill and to save her life, Ron took her to England where several Dianetic groups had asked him to form an organization.&quot; Russell Miller gives a different explanation: &quot;Hubbard wanted to go to London to establish his control over the small Dianetics group which had formed there spontaneously and Mary Sue insisted on accompanying him.&quot; Three weeks later, on September 24, 1952, she gave birth to her first child, Diana Meredith de Wolfe Hubbard. The Hubbards returned to the United States in November when their visa expired and moved into an apartment in Philadelphia.

They went back to London in December on a fresh visa and stayed there until the end of May 1953, before departing for an extended holiday in Spain. In October 1953, they returned to the US where Hubbard gave a series of lectures in Camden, New Jersey, and established the first Church of Scientology. By this time, Mary Sue was well advanced with her second pregnancy and remained largely confined to a rented house at Medford Lakes, New Jersey. They traveled to Phoenix for Christmas 1953, and it was there on January 6, 1954, that Mary Sue gave birth to her second child, Geoffrey Quentin McCaully Hubbard.

The Hubbards lived at a house on Tatum Boulevard (now 5501 North 44th Street) on the slopes of Camelback Mountain in Phoenix for the remainder of 1954. By this time, Mary Sue had become a key figure within the nascent Scientology movement. Although Hubbard himself was much admired by Scientologists, his wife was said to be much less popular. Russell Miller notes:

A family friend, Ray Kemp, later recalled: &quot;their relationship seemed OK, but there never seemed to be a lot of love between them. She was not the affectionate type, she was more efficient than affectionate. They used to have fierce husband and wife domestic arguments.&quot; Joan Vidal, a friend of the sculptor Edward Harris, who was commissioned by Hubbard to create a bust of him, described Mary Sue as &quot;a rather drab, mousy, nothing sort of person, quite a bit younger than him.&quot; Ken Urquhart, who worked for the Hubbards as their butler in the 1960s, commented that Mary Sue &quot;could be very sweet and loving, but also very cold.&quot; Cyril Vosper, one of the Saint Hill staff at the time, noted the differing impressions left by the Hubbards: &quot;I always had great warmth and admiration for Ron – he was a remarkable individual, a constant source of new information and ideas – but I thought Mary Sue was an exceedingly nasty person. She was a bitch.&quot;

Mary Sue became pregnant again four months after Quentin&#x27;s birth, and on February 13, 1955, in Washington, D.C., she gave birth to her second daughter, Mary Suzette Rochelle Hubbard. Following the birth, the Hubbards moved into a house in Silver Spring, Maryland. A Founding Church of Scientology was established in Washington, D.C., and Mary Sue became its first Academy Supervisor.

The Hubbards returned again to London at the end of September 1955, where they took over the day-to-day management of the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International. They remained there until 1957, when Hubbard returned to lecture at the Academy of Scientology in Washington, D.C., with Mary Sue and the children following later. By this time Mary Sue was pregnant for a fourth time and gave birth to her final child, Arthur Ronald Conway Hubbard, on June 6, 1958.

A change in the visa regime in the UK enabled foreigners to remain indefinitely if they had sufficient means to support themselves. The Hubbards moved back to London in February 1959, settling for a while in Golders Green. Not long afterwards Hubbard bought Saint Hill Manor at Saint Hill Green, near East Grinstead, West Sussex. The manor, a country house formerly owned by Sawai Man Singh II, the Maharajah of Jaipur, became both the new home of the Hubbards and the world headquarters of Scientology.

The Hubbards continued to carry out auditing of each other, and in February 1960 Mary Sue wrote to a friend to inform her that her husband had discovered that she had been the writer D.H. Lawrence in a past life. She intended to make use of this discovery by writing a book that would be &quot;completely anti-Christ&quot;. The protagonist, &quot;a bastard child&quot;, would be the son of the three most virile men in the town (a satire of the Holy Trinity). The mother had slept with all three men on the same night but as she did not know which had fathered the child, had &quot;thereupon decided to call him Ali, son of ----, son of ----, and son of ---- which impressed the local inhabitants and created a stir throughout the country.&quot;

By this time, Mary Sue was working as the chief course supervisor at Saint Hill Manor. The Hubbards&#x27; relationship was unconventional, as their butler, Ken Urquhart, later recalled: &quot;Neither Ron nor Mary Sue lived the way one might have expected in a house like that. They spent most of their time working; there was very little socializing. They would go to bed very late, usually in the small hours of the morning, and get up in the early afternoon ... [Mary Sue] had a separate bedroom, but usually had breakfast with him – scrambled eggs, sausages, mushrooms and tomatoes. After breakfast he would go into his office and I would rarely see him again until six-thirty when I had to have the table laid for dinner. At six-twenty-five I would go into his office with a jacket for him to wear to table and after dinner they would spend an hour or so watching television with the children and then he and Mary Sue would return to work in their separate offices.&quot;

On January 26, 1967, Mary Sue was confirmed as a Scientology &quot;Clear&quot;, a somewhat elite rank at that time. Her achievement was commemorated in a special tribute edition of the Scientology newspaper &quot;The Auditor&quot;, titled simply: &quot;Mary Sue Hubbard – Clear #208&quot;. In it, she thanked her husband &quot;for having given the most precious gifts of freedom and true beingness to me and my fellow man. Without him, none of this would have been possible; and so to Ron goes my everlasting gratitude for having provided for all of us the road to Clear.&quot;

==Life at sea==
During the late 1960s, Scientology was faced by an increasingly hostile media and intensifying government scrutiny in a number of countries, notably Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Hubbard decided to take to the high seas in a bid to liberate Scientology from the attentions of hostile governments. On November 22, 1966, the Hubbard Explorational Company Limited was formed with Hubbard and Mary Sue as directors – Hubbard being described as expedition supervisor and Mary Sue as company secretary. Several ships were purchased to serve as the quarters of the newly created &quot;Sea Org&quot;. The flagship of the Scientology fleet was the 3,280-ton vessel – accidentally renamed the &quot;Royal Scotman&quot; due to a clerical error, a former cattle ferry on the Irish Sea run.

After the vessel had been renovated by Scientologists, Mary Sue and the children moved into the upper-deck accommodation in November 1968. The difference in the quality of living conditions between the Hubbards and the crew was stark:

In April 1969, Mary Sue was promoted by Hubbard to serve as the captain of the &quot;Royal Scotman&quot; and ordered to cruise up and down the coast of Spain to train the vessel&#x27;s inexperienced crew of Scientologists, who had made a string of mistakes that infuriated Hubbard. The trip had the air of a punishment detail and was dubbed the &quot;liability cruise&quot;; conditions on board were reportedly appalling. According to Russell Miller, &quot;The crew worked to the point of exhaustion, the food was meager and no one was allowed to wash or change their clothes. Mary Sue enforced the rules rigidly but shared the privations, and was scrupulously fair and popular.&quot; The entire crew was forced to wear gray rags to symbolize their demotion; it was said that even Mary Sue&#x27;s corgi dog, Vixie, had a gray rag tied around her neck. The &quot;liability cruise&quot; ended in June 1969. The &quot;Royal Scotman&quot; was later renamed the &quot;Apollo&quot;.

Apart from captaining the &quot;Royal Scotman&quot; for a period, Mary Sue&#x27;s duties included managing the sprawling empire of the Guardian&#x27;s Office agency within the Church of Scientology and serving as the chair of an executive group known variously as the Commodore&#x27;s Staff Aides, the Aides Council, and the International Board of Scientology Organizations. This body was responsible for overseeing each of the seven organizational subdivisions of the Church of Scientology. She played a central role in the financial management of the Church of Scientology&#x27;s two principal corporations, the Church of Scientology of California and the United Kingdom Church of Scientology. She was a sole signatory to the Church of Scientology&#x27;s trust accounts and was also a director of the Operation Transport Corporation (OTC), a company established in 1968 that served as a conduit for cash transfers from the Church of Scientology to L. Ron Hubbard personally; it was characterized by US Tax Court as a &quot;sham corporation&quot; whose role was the enrichment of the Hubbards. She personally handled large quantities of cash on Hubbard&#x27;s behalf. In the summer of 1972, Hubbard ordered that around $2 million in cash be transferred from OTC bank accounts in Switzerland to the &quot;Apollo&quot;, where it was stored for the next three years in a locked file cabinet to which Mary Sue Hubbard had the only set of keys. Her salary was relatively modest, amounting to $30,430 ($150,732 in 2007 prices) between 1970 and 1972, though she did also benefit from tens of thousands of dollars a year in living expenses paid for by the Church of Scientology.

The Hubbards moved ashore in March 1972 after three years traveling aboard their ship from port to port in the Mediterranean. They set up home in a villa on the outskirts of the Moroccan city of Tangier. Their sojourn in Morocco ended abruptly in December 1972 when it became clear that the Church of Scientology was about to be indicted in France for fraud, and that Hubbard himself was potentially at risk of being extradited to appear in court if the case went to trial. Hubbard returned to the United States, living under a false name in New York City while Mary Sue and the children remained aboard the &quot;Apollo&quot;. They were reunited in September 1973, when the possibility of extradition had passed. When it became known in October 1974 that the FBI wished to interview Hubbard, Mary Sue persuaded her husband to avoid going ashore in the United States and the &quot;Apollo&quot; spent the next year sailing from port to port in the Caribbean.

The Scientology fleet was finally disbanded in 1975, when Hubbard decided to move ashore and establish a &quot;land base&quot; in Florida. He and Mary Sue moved initially to Daytona Beach, Florida, in August 1975. They lived there incognito for a few months before moving into an apartment in Dunedin on the west coast of Florida, a few miles north of the town of Clearwater where a Scientology front company had bought the old Fort Harrison Hotel to serve as Scientology&#x27;s new headquarters. The presence of the Hubbards was meant to be a secret, but in January 1976 he was recognized by a science fiction fan while on a shopping trip. Fearing arrest, he fled to Washington, D.C., with a handful of aides while Mary Sue was left behind in Florida continuing her day-to-day management activities.

In October 1976, Hubbard&#x27;s eldest son by Mary Sue, Quentin, died by suicide at the age of 22. Mary Sue was grief-stricken, though she later attempted to persuade friends that Quentin had died from encephalitis. Her husband&#x27;s reaction was one of fury, blaming Quentin for – in his eyes – letting him down.

==The Guardian&#x27;s Office scandal==
On July 8, 1977, 134 agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation simultaneously stormed the Church of Scientology&#x27;s offices in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, seizing nearly 50,000 documents and other evidence. The raids were in response to the federal government&#x27;s discovery that the Church of Scientology had been carrying out a secret and highly illegal &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign against government agencies, individuals, and institutions deemed to be enemies of Scientology. A year later, on August 15, 1978, Mary Sue Hubbard was indicted by a grand jury, accused of masterminding a conspiracy against the government in her capacity as head of the Church&#x27;s Guardian&#x27;s Office.

Mary Sue was appointed by her husband as Guardian (later Controller) of the Guardian&#x27;s Office (GO) in March 1966. Established in response to the battering that Scientology was receiving at the time from governments and the media, the GO was tasked with tackling any &quot;threat of great importance&quot; to Scientology. This work took a variety of forms, including public relations, legal actions, and the gathering of &quot;intelligence&quot; on perceived enemies. In the UK alone, it issued hundreds of writs against the media for publishing negative reports on Scientology. It carried out an international campaign against psychiatry, Interpol, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other government agencies. Its eventual downfall was to result from the use of illegal methods, ordered and authorized by Mary Sue, to further its campaign.

Mary Sue was promoted to the position of Controller &quot;for life&quot; of the Guardian&#x27;s Office in January 1969, with one of her subordinates, Jane Kember, being appointed to Mary Sue&#x27;s old post of Guardian. Mary Sue continued to manage the GO from her various residences aboard the &quot;Apollo&quot;, and the villa in Tangier. At the order of both of the Hubbards, the GO ran scores of operations against Scientology&#x27;s enemies. The targets were not just external enemies but dissident Scientologists; in 1969, Mary Sue wrote an order directing the GO to cull information from the confessional folders of Scientologists, breaking a rule of confidence that was supposedly sacrosanct. L. Ron Hubbard was said to have been fully aware of the GO&#x27;s actions; the US government would later declare him to be an &quot;unindicted co-conspirator&quot; in the GO&#x27;s illegal activities.

One of their primary targets was the IRS, with which Scientology was engaged in a bitter battle over tax exemptions. As part of a wider strategy codenamed Operation Snow White, the GO succeeded in infiltrating a Scientologist into the IRS to steal files about the government&#x27;s litigation strategy against Scientology. Mary Sue was closely involved in the strategy; a letter written by her, approving the thefts, was later used in evidence against her. In March 1976, she approved an illegal plan to obtain &quot;non-FOI data&quot; from the government, meaning classified documents not available through the Freedom of Information Act. The GO&#x27;s agent in the IRS, Michael Meisner, was ordered to obtain all files concerning L. Ron and Mary Sue Hubbard from the IRS Office of International Operations, which he succeeded in infiltrating.

The espionage continued for another three months before Meisner&#x27;s luck ran out and he was caught in June 1976. Although he bluffed it out initially, a warrant was issued for his arrest in August. The situation was potentially disastrous for the GO and caused panic among the leadership. Mary Sue conspired with her subordinates to concoct alibis for Meisner and work out how to keep him out of the hands of the authorities, keeping him in hiding under a series of false identities. Meisner became increasingly reluctant to cooperate with his GO handlers and in April 1977 he was forcibly taken by GO staff to a new hiding place. He succeeded in escaping in May and turned himself in to the FBI, making a full confession. The raids of July 1977 were the result.

The case eventually came to trial in September 1979, following months of delay occasioned by a fierce rear-guard action by the Church of Scientology&#x27;s lawyers. On October 8, a deal was struck between the government and the Church that the nine defendants – including Mary Sue – would each plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy if they agreed to sign a written stipulation by the government (essentially a public confession) of what they had done, thus avoiding a lengthy trial. They were formally found guilty on October 26, 1979. Mary Sue and two others received the heaviest penalties, a five-year prison sentence and a $10,000 fine. The other five defendants received lesser sentences and fines. Her husband avoided being indicted but was extremely concerned that Mary Sue would betray him. One of his aides, David Mayo, was dispatched by Hubbard to suggest that Mary Sue might consider a divorce. According to Mayo:

==Downfall==

Despite her conviction, Mary Sue remained in her post as Controller of the Guardian&#x27;s Office (GO). There was no shortage of work for her to do; further legal difficulties were anticipated, as there was a New York grand jury investigating Operation Freakout, the GO&#x27;s campaign against New York author Paulette Cooper, and a Florida grand jury looking into Scientology&#x27;s activities in Clearwater. Around the end of February 1980, Ron Hubbard went into hiding and remained in seclusion at the Scientology property Creston Ranch in central California, for the remaining six years of his life. Mary Sue, who had last met with her husband a few months before his disappearance, never saw or heard from him again.

Hubbard nonetheless remained active in the management of Scientology. The criminal conviction of the GO&#x27;s top executives triggered a lengthy power struggle at the top of the Church of Scientology, which would lead eventually to Mary Sue being forced into retirement. Under his doctrine he believed that &quot;mistakes do not just happen, somebody causes them, always&quot;. A disaster on the scale of the GO criminal case was clearly the result of the activities of someone hostile to Scientology – a suppressive person – operating within the GO. He issued an internal directive in 1979 asserting that major failures must result from the presence of multiple Suppressives, who would need to be rooted out along with their &quot;connections&quot;. The downfall of the GO led Hubbard to distrust it, believing it to be riddled with Suppressives; he severed his communications with it and put his reliance instead on the Commodore&#x27;s Messenger Organization (CMO), a group he had formed in 1968 and whose purpose was to relay messages to and from church staff as Ron&#x27;s personal representatives. The Messengers, who were mostly in their teens and early twenties, became Hubbard&#x27;s sole means of communication with the Church.

In 1981, the &quot;All Clear Unit&quot; was established within the CMO, tasked with the purpose of making it &quot;All Clear&quot; for Hubbard to come out of hiding. One of its principal figures was David Miscavige, a 21-year-old Messenger who had worked as a cameraman for Hubbard. In May 1981, he met with Mary Sue to tell her that her position as Controller of the Guardian&#x27;s Office was untenable. She reacted angrily; in a 1992 trial in Canada, Miscavige told the court that she had called him &quot;some pretty nasty names&quot; and threatened him with a large ashtray held close to his face, but she had eventually agreed to step down. She subsequently changed her mind, believing that she had been tricked, and wrote to her husband to complain but received no response. Numerous other Guardian&#x27;s Office personnel were purged as well.

In July 1981, all remaining GO staff were ordered to join the Sea Org, which would thus secure the CMO&#x27;s control of the Guardian&#x27;s Office, and the current Guardian, Jane Kember – who was one of those convicted on conspiracy charges – was to be removed. Mary Sue strongly opposed these changes and reappointed herself Controller, rescinding the CMO&#x27;s permission to investigate the GO. CMO staff investigating the GO were physically expelled from the Church of Scientology&#x27;s Los Angeles headquarters, and the Controller&#x27;s files were guarded day and night. Mary Sue attempted to contact her husband to rescind the CMO&#x27;s takeover bid but failed, and admitted defeat when the Messengers produced an undated dispatch from Hubbard instructing the GO to be put under the CMO when its senior executives went to prison. She stood down again, being replaced by a South African Scientologist named Gordon Cook, and Jane Kember was replaced by David Gaiman, a British Scientologist.

Miscavige provided a first-hand account of these events, in an affidavit submitted in a case heard in 1994 in California, &quot;Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz&quot;. He stated:

Speaking several years later to the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; newspaper, Miscavige commented:

&quot;I knew if it was going to be a physical takeover we&#x27;re going to lose because they had a couple thousand staff and we (the &quot;messengers&quot;) had about 50. That is the amazing part about it.&quot;

According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard himself did not find out about Mary Sue&#x27;s resignation until five months later.

The convictions of Mary Sue Hubbard and the other GO staff executives were upheld by a federal appeals court in October 1981, and in November seven of those convicted dropped their appeals – but not Mary Sue, who continued to fight the charges. She lost her final appeal in April 1982 and was ordered to begin a prison term in January 1983. The original sentence of five years imprisonment was not carried out, and the court ordered a study of her claimed medical problems, before eventually replacing her sentence with a four-year term of imprisonment, with parole set at 40 months. She was sent to the federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky, to serve her sentence, though in the end, she was released after only a year of imprisonment.

==Life after the Guardian&#x27;s Office==

After her resignation from the GO, Mary Sue Hubbard ceased to have any involvement in the management of the Church of Scientology. She did, however, resurface on a few occasions during the remaining years of her life. In 1984 she acted as an &quot;intervenor&quot; in the Church of Scientology of California&#x27;s lawsuit against Gerry Armstrong. He had worked as an archivist for the Church of Scientology, gathering source material for a planned biography of L. Ron Hubbard. He became disillusioned with Scientology and left the Church, taking with him copies of biographical material, including Hubbard&#x27;s letters to Mary Sue over the years. The Church sued in 1982 and Mary Sue joined the suit, charging that Armstrong had committed an &quot;invasion of privacy&quot;. When the case came to trial in May 1984, she told the Superior Court of Los Angeles County that she had been &quot;mentally raped&quot; and &quot;emotionally distressed&quot; knowing that others had seen the documents. She told the court that she had not seen her husband since January 1980, &quot;but I&#x27;ve written him personal letters ... but I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s getting them&quot; as he had not replied to them. In June 1984, Judge Paul G. Breckenridge ruled against the Church and Mary Sue Hubbard, criticizing her credibility as a witness:

A month later, in the English High Court of Justice, Mr Justice Latey declared in a case in which Scientology was a prominent issue that &quot;Mr Hubbard is a charlatan and worse, as are his wife, Mary Sue Hubbard, and the clique at the top privy to the cult&#x27;s activities.&quot;

In October 1984, Mary Sue filed a $5 million lawsuit against her husband&#x27;s first son, Ronald DeWolf, accusing him of &quot;massive fraud&quot; for attempting to have his father declared legally dead or mentally incompetent. L. Ron Hubbard died on January 24, 1986, at his ranch near Creston, California.

A Scientology spokesman informed the press that she had been left &quot;a very generous provision&quot; in her husband&#x27;s will, though the details were kept secret. Mary Sue Hubbard continued to be active in Scientology well into the 1990s; in a 1994 Scientology magazine, she was listed as a &quot;Patron&quot; of the International Association of Scientologists, indicating a donation of $40,000. In December 1995, Hubbard had a mastectomy of her left breast. In 1998 she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in addition to her existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mary Sue Hubbard died on November 25, 2002, aged 71, at her home in Los Angeles. Her body was cremated two days later and her ashes were scattered at sea off the California coast, where L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s ashes had similarly been scattered in January 1986.

<text>The WAMPAS Baby Stars was a promotional campaign sponsored by the United States Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers, which honored 13 (15 in 1932) young actresses each year whom they believed to be on the threshold of movie stardom. The campaign ran from 1922 to 1934, except for 1930 and 1933.

Most failed to live up to their promotion. However, a small number of the selections went on to become major movie stars: Colleen Moore (1922), Jobyna Ralston (1923), Clara Bow (1924), Janet Gaynor (1926), Fay Wray (1926), Dolores del Rio (1926), Dolores Costello (1926), Mary Astor (1926), Joan Crawford (1926), Loretta Young (1929), Jean Arthur (1929), Joan Blondell (1931) and Ginger Rogers (1932). Gaynor, Astor, Crawford, Young and Rogers all were awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress during their careers, with Gaynor receiving the first one during the first year of the award&#x27;s existence. 

Clara Bow was a Silent era star known as The It Girl. She was Hollywood&#x27;s greatest female draw at her peak and her final film was in 1933. Bow was also in the first movie to receive the Academy Award for Outstanding Picture, &quot;Wings&quot;, in 1929. Arthur and Blondell had long and fruitful careers in Hollywood, the former as a lead actress, the latter usually in supporting roles after the Pre-Code era.

Others with significant Hollywood careers included Evelyn Brent (1923), Joyce Compton (1926), Lupe Velez (1928), Constance Cummings (1931, who decamped to England), Frances Dee (1931), and Gloria Stuart (1932, whose career revived in the 1990s when she received a nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;Titanic&quot;).

== Overview ==
;1922—1935
The WAMPAS Baby Stars campaign began in 1922. Every year, publicists chose a group of young actresses who were under contract at major studios that they felt were on the threshold of stardom. Awardees were honored at a party called the &quot;WAMPAS Frolic&quot; and were given extensive media coverage. The awards were not given in 1930 and 1933 due to objections from independent film studios. When the campaign was revived in 1934, freelance actresses, along with studio contract players, were included as the chosen &quot;Baby Stars&quot;. The campaign was discarded in 1935, after which the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers disbanded. 

;1956
In 1956, a group of veteran stars, among them 1932 WAMPAS Baby Star Ginger Rogers, chose a group of young actresses supposed to be known as &quot;The Wampas Baby Stars of 1956&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/517767346&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers no longer existed so the idea fizzled. The selection took place nevertheless;15 &quot;babies&quot; were chosen: Phyllis Applegate, Roxanne Arlen, Jolene Brand, Donna Cooke, Barbara Huffman (later known as Barbara Eden), Jewell Lain, Barbara Marks&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/515024432&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, Lita Milan, Norma Nilsson, Ina Poindexter, Violet Rensin, Dawn Richard, and Delfin Thursday.

<text>The Inman Report, formally known as the Report of the Secretary of State&#x27;s Advisory Panel on Overseas Security, was a report released in 1985 in response to the Marine barracks bombing and the April 1983 US Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon. The report is usually known by the name of its chairman, Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, USN (Ret.)

The report recommended a range of security improvements, including increased setback between embassies and public streets. It also recommended a major building program to improve security in existing embassies, and build new embassies to replace those that could not meet security standards. A direct result from the Report was the creation of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Diplomatic Security Service within the U.S. State Department.

==Background==

The early 1980s experienced a wave of terrorist attacks on diplomatic premises. In the Middle East, the United States of America was intended. On April 18, 1983, a mass bombing resulted in the death of 63 people, including 18 Americans, and the injuring of 120 people in an attack by Islamic Jihad on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. The attack involved the use of a suicide bomber who drove a truck filled with 20, 000 pounds of explosives to the front of the Embassy. On December 12, 1983, another attack was targeted towards the United States in Kuwait City, which caused five deaths. Beirut experienced a second attack on September 20, 1984. This time a truck bomb killed 24 people, including two Americans and injured an additional 21. These attacks prompted the United States to take a new perspective regarding the protection of diplomatic premises.

After several attacks in the Middle East, the Inman Report was created by the Advisory Panel on Overseas Security under the chairmanship of Admiral Bobby Ray Inman. In June 1985, the Inman Report was released and focused upon the issues of the United States&#x27; diplomatic business. The report issued a seven-year plan that initiated the replacement of 126 posts (out of 262) with more secure standards such as walled compounds, new security standards, minimums for setbacks, maximums for windows and additional architectural enhancements. Not only did it include the alteration of posts, a new construction of at-risk missions was created. The Inman Report called for advanced formation of the Diplomatic Security Service (DS), which looked to oversee security protection aspects at all overseas operations regarding the United States.

==Building program inferences==

The necessity for a building program was due to the threat factors towards the United States diplomatic facilities in other countries. The program implements an increase in basic security standards to protect against terrorism. The Panel was able to draw some general conclusions based on the concern of these threats:
*The United States must have complete control of their facilities overseas
*To avoid penetration and assault, the location of these buildings is of great importance. It is no longer an asset to be on the busiest, more popular street
*It is equally important to consider the collocation of these buildings as occupants whom the United States doesn&#x27;t control or choose can pose a risk
*Modern electronic and audio technology can make it hard to safeguard important information; therefore, proximity to other buildings plays a key factor
*Many buildings cannot be upgraded so age, architecture, and the design of the building are a concern for the ability to defend penetration and assault
*The old approach to business must be overturned to promote a new approach for overseas construction and adequate funding for the program

While it is not certain that the terrorist attacks will diminish entirely, preventative inferences can be taken to reduce the risk of harm by updating and/or relocating those buildings.

==Budgeting of foreign buildings==

As the Inman Report outlines the importance of improving its foreign buildings, the report requires there to be a shift from previous priorities and workloads concerning overseas buildings in order to implement the report&#x27;s objectives. To accomplish this work effort a total of over 344 offices in 130 countries is needed. New methods are being implemented so appropriate actions can be taken in order for enhancements to be fulfilled accordingly. In response to the alteration of buildings, new methods for budgeting and funding must be put into place. This is the first step towards incorporating the Inman Report&#x27;s standards on buildings.

Currently, the Department of State&#x27;s budgeting procedures for foreign buildings has several weaknesses. Its present processes contribute to lengthy delays concerning the completion of building projects. These procedures can effect the decisions regarding funding and priorities based on the costs of each project instead of on security and other operational criteria. Consequently, the procedures that are currently put in place are compelling building projects to contend for funding against other non-investment plans in the budget. The procedures also decline flexible responses to temporary real estate opportunities that are quite common overseas.

As new facilities are required to contain particular specifications, and the amount of resources and production involved in the construction of the buildings are plentiful, a new funding approach must be created in order for the planned projects to be carried out effectively. The Capital Budgeting system will allow for greater flexibility, while forcing capital investments to vie for funding against day-to-day operations. The Department of State is required to seek approval from Congress to carry out the Capital Budgeting System for foreign buildings.

<text>Holsten Brewery (Holsten-Brauerei AG) is a brewing company founded in 1879 in what is now Hamburg&#x27;s Altona-Nord quarter. The group now has seven breweries in Germany. Its nationally distributed premium brand is the pale lager &quot;Holsten Pilsener&quot;. The company was acquired by the Carlsberg Group in 2004.

== History ==
In 1902, Holsten Brauerei bought the Union Brewery, Point Pleasant, Wandsworth on the south bank of the River Thames in London. Trade suffered from anti-German sentiment during the First World War and it closed in 1920. Holsten Pils was first imported into the UK in 1952, creating the premium packaged lager market. In 1979 the first of many award-winning TV ad campaigns was launched featuring actor Donald Pleasence and in the mid-1980s Holsten became the UK&#x27;s number one selling premium packaged lager. In 1991, Holsten acquired the Mecklenburgische Brauerei Lübz. Until 1999, Holsten UK operated as a joint venture between Holsten Brauerei and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, but in that year the joint venture was dissolved and Holsten UK took over responsibility for the on-trade, followed in 2000 by the off-trade.

In 2003, Holsten Brewery absorbed the Bavaria – St. Pauli Brewery with their main brand &quot;Astra&quot;. The Holsten group subsidiary Hansa-Brunnen AG has two plants producing mineral water and carbonated soft drinks, mainly for distribution in northern Germany.

The present-day Holsten brewery in Altona has a production capacity of . Its biggest-selling product is the premium brand &quot;Holsten Pilsener&quot; sold on the German market. The beers exported by the Holsten group are also brewed in Altona.

In 2004, Holsten-Brauerei was acquired by Carlsberg for £735 million. Holsten produces both &quot;Tuborg&quot; and &quot;Carlsberg&quot; for the German market.

Holsten is specially produced in Germany (since 1879), but it may be produced by other Carlsberg companies around the world.

On 6 November 2014, there was a strike at the brewery with 200 employees involved.

<text>Léger is the largest Canadian-owned market research and analytics company, with more than 600 employees in eight Canadian and US offices. The company was founded in 1986 by the father and son duo Marcel Léger, former environment minister of Quebec, and Jean-Marc Léger, economist. Previously, the company was known as Léger &amp; Léger (1986–1996) and Léger Marketing (1996–2013).  It is now led solely by Jean-Marc Léger.

The firm is headquartered in Montreal, with offices in Toronto, Quebec City, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, and Vancouver in Canada, and Philadelphia in the United States. To date, Léger has acquired 12 companies.

In 1995, Léger &amp; Léger repositioned itself in marketing research and became Léger Marketing. In 2000, the polling firm announced the acquisition of Criterion Research Corporation of Toronto. It then expanded westward with the acquisition of Criterion (Edmonton) in 2005 and Claros Research (Calgary) in 2006.

In 2005, Léger conducted the first online surveys in Canada with its Leger Web division.

In 2007, Léger Marketing entered the American market by acquiring ARC Research, a Philadelphia-based firm.

In 2010, Jean-Marc Léger became founding president of WIN, a worldwide association of polling firms that includes 75 major independent research firms from 73 countries. After making several acquisitions to provide Léger Marketing with the technological innovations needed to raise the Quebec company to a world-class position, its founder Jean-Marc Léger feels ready to take the next step: Léger Marketing becomes Léger (Research – Strategy – Consulting) and expands its offer in strategic consulting and advanced statistical analysis.

In 2012, Léger became a majority shareholder in Agility Metrics, a Montreal-based company built around a cloud computing application for measuring customer experience. Agility Metrics later became Léger Metrics. In the same year, Léger – Recherche Stratégie Conseil announced that it had acquired Researchology, a Toronto-based marketing research firm specializing in pharmaceutical research. In 2013, Léger acquired Ifop North America (located in Toronto), with marketing research experience in the pharmaceutical and consumer goods sectors.

In 2014, Léger became a minority shareholder and strategic partner of imarklab, positioned as the Canadian leader in interactive marketing intelligence. By combining traditional marketing research efforts with neuroscience, the imarklab-Léger partnership facilitates better understanding and intervention on customer behaviour across multiple channels of commerce.

In 2018, Léger launched its Léger Analytiques division. In 2019, Leger completed the acquisition of Vancouver-based National Research Group (NRG), the largest company in Western Canada with offices in Vancouver, Calgary, and Winnipeg. In the same year, Legerweb becomes LEO (Léger Opinion), the largest Canadian online panel with over 400,000 panelists.

In 2020, Léger acquired SmartPoint Research; a Toronto-based market research firm specialized in the consumer and healthcare sectors. This strategic acquisition enabled Léger to increase the size of its Léger Opinion (LEO) panel, supplement its patient and healthcare professional panels, and broaden its healthcare research service offering.  

In October 2021, Léger acquired Ressac, a digital performance agency based in Montreal and specializing in media strategy and branded content activation. 

In November 2021, Léger acquired Insights West; a Vancouver-based market research and analytics firm. This was Leger’s second acquisition in less than a month after acquiring digital agency Ressac and its 12th acquisition in total.

<text>In number theory, an octahedral number is a figurate number that represents the number of spheres in an octahedron formed from close-packed spheres. The th octahedral number formula_1 can be obtained by the formula:

:formula_2

The first few octahedral numbers are: 

:1, 6, 19, 44, 85, 146, 231, 344, 489, 670, 891 .

==Properties and applications==
The octahedral numbers have a generating function

:formula_3

Sir Frederick Pollock conjectured in 1850 that every positive integer is the sum of at most 7 octahedral numbers. This statement, the Pollock octahedral numbers conjecture, has been proven true for all but finitely many numbers.

In chemistry, octahedral numbers may be used to describe the numbers of atoms in octahedral clusters; in this context they are called magic numbers.

==Relation to other figurate numbers==

===Square pyramids===
An octahedral packing of spheres may be partitioned into two square pyramids, one upside-down underneath the other, by splitting it along a square cross-section. Therefore,
the octahedral number formula_1 can be obtained by adding two consecutive square pyramidal numbers together:
:formula_5

===Tetrahedra===
If formula_1 is the octahedral number and formula_7 is the tetrahedral number then
:formula_8
This represents the geometric fact that gluing a tetrahedron onto each of four non-adjacent faces of an octahedron produces a tetrahedron of twice the size.

Another relation between octahedral numbers and tetrahedral numbers is also possible, based on the fact that an octahedron may be divided into four tetrahedra each having two adjacent original faces (or alternatively, based on the fact that each square pyramidal number is the sum of two tetrahedral numbers):
:formula_9

===Cubes===
If two tetrahedra are attached to opposite faces of an octahedron, the result is a rhombohedron. The number of close-packed spheres in the rhombohedron is a cube, justifying the equation
:formula_10

===Centered squares===

The difference between two consecutive octahedral numbers is a centered square number:
:formula_11
Therefore, an octahedral number also represents the number of points in a square pyramid formed by stacking centered squares; for this reason, in his book &quot;Arithmeticorum libri duo&quot; (1575), Francesco Maurolico called these numbers &quot;pyramides quadratae secundae&quot;.

The number of cubes in an octahedron formed by stacking centered squares is a centered octahedral number, the sum of two consecutive octahedral numbers. These numbers are
:1, 7, 25, 63, 129, 231, 377, 575, 833, 1159, 1561, 2047, 2625, ... 
given by the formula 
:formula_12 for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ...

==History==
The first study of octahedral numbers appears to have been by René Descartes, around 1630, in his &quot;De solidorum elementis&quot;. Prior to Descartes, figurate numbers had been studied by the ancient Greeks and by Johann Faulhaber, but only for polygonal numbers, pyramidal numbers, and cubes. Descartes introduced the study of figurate numbers based on the Platonic solids and some of the semiregular polyhedra; his work included the octahedral numbers. However, &quot;De solidorum elementis&quot; was lost, and not rediscovered until 1860. In the meantime, octahedral numbers had been studied again by other mathematicians, including Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg in 1774, Georg Simon Klügel in 1808, and Sir Frederick Pollock in 1850.

<text>Political polarization (spelled &quot;polarisation&quot; in British English, Australian English, and New Zealand English) is the divergence of political attitudes away from the center, towards ideological extremes. Scholars distinguish between ideological polarization (differences between the policy positions) and affective polarization (an emotional dislike and distrust of political out-groups).

Most discussions of polarization in political science consider polarization in the context of political parties and democratic systems of government. In two-party systems, political polarization usually embodies the tension of its binary political ideologies and partisan identities. However, some political scientists assert that contemporary polarization depends less on policy differences on a left and right scale but increasingly on other divisions such as religious against secular, nationalist against globalist, traditional against modern, or rural against urban. Polarization is associated with the process of politicization.

==Definitions and measurements==

Polarization itself is typically understood as &quot;a prominent division or conflict that forms between major groups in a society or political system and that is marked by the clustering and radicalisation of views and beliefs at two distant and antagonistic poles.&quot; as defined by the Institute for Integrated Transitions and Ford Foundation.

Political scientists typically distinguish between two levels of political polarization: elite and mass. &quot;Elite polarization&quot; focuses on the polarization of the political elites, like party organizers and elected officials. &quot;Mass polarization&quot; (or popular polarization) focuses on the polarization of the masses, most often the electorate or general public.

===Elite polarization===
Elite polarization refers to polarization between the party-in-government and the party-in-opposition. Polarized political parties are internally cohesive, unified, programmatic, and ideologically distinct; they are typically found in a parliamentary system of democratic governance.

In a two-party system, a polarized legislature has two important characteristics: first, there is little-to-no ideological overlap between members of the two parties; and second, almost all conflict over legislation and policies is split across a broad ideological divide. This leads to a conflation of political parties and ideologies (i.e., Democrat and Republican become nearly perfect synonyms for liberal and conservative) and the collapse of an ideological center. However, using a cross-national design that covers 25 European countries, a recent study shows that it is not the number of parties itself, but the way a party interreacts with another that influences the magnitude and nature of affective polarization.

The vast majority of studies on elite polarization focus on legislative and deliberative bodies. For many years, political scientists measured polarization in the US by examining the ratings of party members published by interest groups, but now, most analyze roll-call voting patterns to investigate trends in party-line voting and party unity. Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy used the text of the Congressional Record to document differences in speech patterns between Republicans and Democrats as a measure of polarization, finding a dramatic increase in polarized speech patterns starting in 1994.

=== Mass polarization ===
Mass polarization, or popular polarization, occurs when an electorate&#x27;s attitudes towards political issues, policies, celebrated figures, or other citizens are neatly divided along party lines. At the extreme, each camp questions the moral legitimacy of the other, viewing the opposing camp and its policies as an existential threat to their way of life or the nation as a whole.

There are multiple types or measures of mass polarization. &quot;Ideological polarization&quot; refers to the extent to which the electorate has divergent beliefs on ideological issues (e.g., abortion or affirmative action) or beliefs that are consistently conservative or liberal across a range of issues (e.g., having a conservative position on both abortion and affirmative action even if those positions are not &quot;extreme&quot;). &quot;Partisan sorting&quot; refers to the extent to which the electorate &quot;sorts&quot; or identifies with a party based on their ideological, racial, religious, gender, or other demographic characteristics. &quot;Affective polarization&quot; refers to the extent to which the electorate &quot;dislikes&quot; or &quot;distrusts&quot; those from other parties.

Political scientists who study mass polarization generally rely on data from opinion polls and election surveys. They look for trends in respondents&#x27; opinions on a given issue, their voting history, and their political ideology (conservative, liberal, moderate, etc.), and they try to relate those trends to respondents&#x27; party identification and other potentially polarizing factors (like geographic location or income bracket). Political scientists typically limit their inquiry to issues and questions that have been constant over time, in order to compare the present day to what the political climate has historically been. Some of recent studies also use decision-making games to measure the extent to which ingroup members discriminate outgroup members relative to their group members.

Recent academic work suggests that intolerance at the ideological extremes can lead to polarization with opinions more polarized than identities, intolerance among moderates improves cohesion.

Some political scientists argue that polarization requires divergence on a broad range of issues, while others argue that only a few issues are required. 
=== Affective polarization ===
Affective polarization refers to the phenomenon where individuals&#x27; feelings and emotions towards members of their own political party or group become more positive, while their feelings towards members of the opposing party or group become more negative. This can lead to increased hostility and a lack of willingness to compromise or work together with people who hold different political views. This phenomenon can be seen in both online and offline settings, and has been on the rise in several countries in recent years. Affective polarization has been estimated via a variety of methods, including the Affective Polarization Scale.

Affective polarization may lead to aggressive attitudes and behaviors toward members of other ideological groups within the same country. Extreme affective polarization may even lead to dangerous consequences like societal disintegration. Affective polarization can be reduced by various means, such as feeling sadness together as a group (which often happens during Memorial Days). A high prevalence of respectful discussions with political others may also reduce affective polarization by increasing political tolerance and inter-party trust. High salience of a national common identity may also reduce affective polarization, as members of other parties are suddenly seen as in-group members.

==Causes==
There are various causes of political polarization and these include political parties, redistricting, the public&#x27;s political ideology, the mass media, and political context.

===Party polarization===
Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant. This theory is based on recent trends in the United States Congress, where the majority party prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its party platform and political ideology. The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate. For example, after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased, while the number of conservative Republicans increased. Within the electorate during the 1970s, Southern Democrats shifted toward the Republican Party, showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties. In this sense, political polarization could be a top-down process, in which elite polarization leads to—or at least precedes—popular polarization. However, polarization among elites does not necessarily produce polarization within the electorate, and polarized electoral choices can often reflect elite polarization rather than voters&#x27; preferences.

Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions. These argue that during the early 1990s, the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the United States House of Representatives—which political scientists Thomas E. Mann and Norman Ornstein refer to as Newt Gingrich&#x27;s &quot;guerrilla war.&quot; What political scientists have found is that moderates are less likely to run than are candidates who are in line with party doctrine, otherwise known as &quot;party fit.&quot; Other theories state politicians who cater to more extreme groups within their party tend to be more successful, helping them stay in office while simultaneously pulling their constituency toward a polar extreme. A study by Nicholson (2012) found voters are more polarized by contentious statements from leaders of the opposing party than from the leaders of their own party. As a result, political leaders may be more likely to take polarized stances.

With regards to multiparty systems, Giovanni Sartori (1966, 1976) claims the splitting of ideologies in the public constituency causes further divides within the political parties of the countries. He theorizes that the extremism of public ideological movement is the basis for the creation of highly polarized multiparty systems. Sartori named this polarizing phenomenon polarized pluralism and claimed it would lead to further polarization in many opposing directions (as opposed to in simply two directions, as in a polarized two-party system) over policy issues. Polarization in multiparty systems can also be defined along two ideological extremes, like in the case of India in the 1970s. Ideological splits within a number of India&#x27;s major parties resulted in two polarized coalitions on the right and left, each consisting of multiple political parties.

Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators. Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers, in order to support the party&#x27;s campaigns. After &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;, special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending, notably through Super political action committees. Some, such as &quot;Washington Post&quot; opinion writer Robert Kaiser, argued this allowed wealthy people, corporations, unions, and other groups to push the parties&#x27; policy platforms toward ideological extremes, resulting in a state of greater polarization. Other scholars, such as Raymond J. La Raja and David L. Wiltse, note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns. These scholars argue a single donor who is polarized and contributes large sums to a campaign does not seem to usually drive a politician toward political extremes.

===The public===
In democracies and other representative governments, citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them. Some scholars argue that political polarization reflects the public&#x27;s ideology and voting preferences. Dixit and Weibull (2007) claim that political polarization is a natural and regular phenomenon. Party loyalism is a strong element of voters&#x27; thinking. Individuals who have higher political knowledge will not be influenced by anything a politician says. The polarization is merely a reflection of the party that the voter belongs to, and whichever direction it moves in. They argue that there is a link between public differences in ideology and the polarization of representatives, but that an increase in preference differences is usually temporary and ultimately results in compromise. Fernbach, Rogers, Fox and Sloman (2013) argue that it is a result of people having an exaggerated faith in their understanding of complex issues. Asking people to explain their policy preferences in detail typically resulted in more moderate views. Simply asking them to list the reasons for their preferences did not result in any such moderation.

Studies undertaken in the U.S. (2019) and the UK (2022) have found that political polarization is generally less acute among the public than is portrayed in the media. Moreover, non-nuanced reporting by the media about poll data and public opinions can even aggravate political polarization.

Morris P. Fiorina (2006, 2008) posits the hypothesis that polarization is a phenomenon which does not hold for the public, and instead is formulated by commentators to draw further division in government. Fiorina connects this phenomenon to what he describes as &quot;party sorting&quot;, which is where political ideologies tend to associate with specific political parties (conservatives with the Republican Party and liberals with the Democratic party). Other studies indicate that cultural differences focusing on ideological movements and geographical polarization within the United States constituency is correlated with rises in overall political polarization between 1972 and 2004.

Religious, ethnic, and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization. According to Layman et al. (2005), the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide. They claim that Democrats have generally become more moderate in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist. For example, political scientists have shown that in the United States, voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly evangelical candidate than Democratic voters. This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States. Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization, but rather, coalition and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme.

In some post-colonial countries, the public may be polarized along ethnic divides that remain from the colonial regime. In South Africa in the late 1980s, members of the conservative, pro-apartheid National Party were no longer supportive of apartheid, and, therefore, no longer ideologically aligned with their party. Dutch Afrikaners, white English, and native Africans split based on racial divisions, causing polarization along ethnic lines.

Economic inequality can also motivate the polarization of the public. For example, in post-World War I Germany, the Communist Workers Party, and the National Socialists, a fascist party, emerged as the dominant political ideologies and proposed to address Germany&#x27;s economic problems in drastically different ways. In Venezuela, in the late 20th century, presidential candidate Hugo Chávez used economic inequality in the country to polarize voters, employing a popular and aggressive tone to gain popularity.

===The media===
Also stated by Sheena Peckham, algorithms used by social media to operate creates an echo-chamber for the user causing selective exposure and thus leading to online hate, misinformation, malinformation and more (Peckham, 2023). A number of techniques were employed by the researchers and social scientist to trace the relationship between internet usage. Lelkes, along with his colleagues, use state right-of-way laws, which affect the cost of internet infrastructure, as an instrument used for internet access in their country (Lelkes et al. 2017) and discovered a positive relation between internet access and affective polarization in the country. At the same time, (Alcot et al. 2021) conducted another experiment in which individuals in the US. were asked to deactivate their Facebook account for a $102 incentive, prior to the US. midterm election. It was found that those who deactivated their accounts and did not use Facebook were less polarized as compared to those individuals whose accounts were still activated during the experiment. 

In addition, Boxell assess ANEX data from 1972-2016 by age cohorts analyzing their likelihood of using social media. He was shocked to found that the largest polarization index over time was occurred among oldest cohort, which was less likely to use social media (Boxell et al., 2017). Thus, he found a small or negative relation between internet usage and polarization. Also, Markus Prior in his article tried to trace the causal link between social media and affective polarization but he found no evidence that partisan media are making ordinary American voter more partisan, thus negating the role of partisan media as a cause of affective polarization (Prior, 2013).

The mass media has grown as an institution over the past half-century. Political scientists argue that this has particularly affected the voting public in the last three decades, as previously less partisan viewers are given more polarized news media choices. The mass media&#x27;s current, fragmented, high-choice environment has induced a movement of the audience from more even-toned political programming to more antagonistic and one-sided broadcasts and articles. These programs tend to appeal to partisan viewers who watch the polarized programming as a self-confirming source for their ideologies.

Countries with less diversified but emerging media markets, such as China and South Korea, have become more polarized due to the diversification of political media. In addition, most search engines and social networks (e.g., Google, Facebook) now utilize computer algorithms as filters, which personalize web content based on a user&#x27;s search history, location, and previous clicking patterns, creating more polarized access to information. This method of personalizing web content results in &quot;filter bubbles&quot;, a term coined by digital activist Eli Pariser that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views.

A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions. This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated. Other research also shows that online media does not contribute to the increased polarization of opinions. Solomon Messing and Sean J. Westwood state that individuals do not necessarily become polarized through media because they choose their own exposure, which tends to already align with their views. For instance, in an experiment where people could choose the content they wanted, people did not start to dislike their political opponents more after selecting between pro or anti immigration content. People did, however, start to counterargue the content.

Academic studies found that providing people with impartial, objective information has the potential to reduce political polarization, but the effect of information on polarization is highly sensitive to contextual factors. Specifically, polarization over government spending was reduced when people were provided with a &quot;Taxpayer Receipt,&quot; but not when they were also asked how they wanted the money to be spent. This suggests that subtle factors like the mood and tone of partisan news sources may have a large effect on how the same information is interpreted. This is confirmed by another study that shows that different emotions of messages can lead to polarization or convergence: joy is prevalent in emotional polarization, while sadness and fear play significant roles in emotional convergence. These findings can help to design more socially responsible algorithms by starting to focus on the emotional content of algorithmic recommendations.

Research has primarily focused on the United States, a country with high polarization that has also increased over time. In Sweden, on the other hand, there is a stable ideological polarization over time. Experiments and surveys from Sweden also give limited support to the idea of increased ideological or affective polarization due to media use.

=== The political context ===
Some of recent studies emphasize the role of electoral context and the way parties interact with each other. For example, a recent study shows that coalition partnership can moderate the extent of affective polarization over parties. However, this study does not find evidence that the number of political parties and district magnitude that captures the proportionality of electoral systems would influence the extent of affective polarization. Also, electoral context, such as electoral salience, involvement in elections, elite polarization, and the strength of Eurosceptic parties, can intensify the divide.

The impact of redistricting—potentially through gerrymandering or the manipulation of electoral borders to favor a political party—on political polarization in the United States has been found to be minimal in research by leading political scientists. Ranked-choice voting has also been put forward as a solution to political polarization.

When politicians repeatedly favor partisan media outlets, they reinforce their supporters&#x27; existing biases, which can further fuel political polarization within the public.

==Consequences==
The implications of political polarization &quot;are not entirely clear and may include some benefits as well as detrimental consequences.&quot; Polarization can be benign, natural, and democratizing, or it can be pernicious, having long term malignant effects on society and congesting essential democratic functions. Where voters see the parties as less divergent, they are less likely to be satisfied with how their democracy works. While its exact effects are disputed, it clearly alters the political process and the political composition of the general public.

=== Pernicious polarization ===
In political science, pernicious polarization occurs when a single political cleavage overrides other divides and commonalities to the point it has boiled into a single divide which becomes entrenched and self-reinforcing. Unlike most types of polarization, pernicious polarization does not need to be ideological. Rather, pernicious polarization operates on a single political cleavage, which can be partisan identity, religious vs secular, globalist vs nationalist, urban vs rural, etc. This political divide creates an explosion of mutual group distrust which hardens between the two political parties (or coalitions) and spreads beyond the political sphere into societal relations. People begin to perceive politics as &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them.&quot; The office of Ombudsman of Argentina has been vacant since 2009, along with a companion Public Defender&#x27;s office, allegedly because of pernicious polarization.

====Causes====
According to Carothers &amp; O&#x27;Donohue (2019), pernicious polarization is a process most often driven by a single political cleavage dominating an otherwise pluralistic political life, overriding other cleavages. On the other hand, Slater &amp; Arugay (2019) have argued that it&#x27;s not the depth of a single social cleavage, but the political elite&#x27;s process for removing a leader which best explains whether or not polarization truly becomes pernicious. Lebas &amp; Munemo (2019) have argued pernicious polarization is marked by both deeper societal penetration and segregation than other forms of political polarization, making it less amenable to resolution. It is agreed, however, that pernicious polarization reinforces and entrenches itself, dragging the country into a downward spiral of anger and division for which there are no easy remedies.

====Effect on governance====
Pernicious polarization makes compromise, consensus, interaction, and tolerance increasingly costly and tenuous for individuals and political actors on both sides of the divide. Pernicious polarization routinely weakens respect for democratic norms, corrodes basic legislative processes, undermines the nonpartisan nature of the judiciary and fuels public disaffection with political parties. It exacerbates intolerance and discrimination, diminishes societal trust, and increases violence throughout the society. As well as potentially leading to democratic backsliding. In country-by-country instances of pernicious polarization, it is common to see the winner exclude the loser from positions of power or using means to prevent the loser from becoming a threat in the future. In these situations, the loser typically questions the legitimacy of the institutions allowing the winner to create a hegemony, which causes citizens to grow cynical towards politics. In these countries, politics is often seen as a self-referential power game that has nothing to do with people.

====Effect on public trust====

Perniciously polarized societies often witness public controversies over factually provable questions. During this process, facts and moral truths increasingly lose their weight, as more people conform to the messages of their own bloc. Social and political actors such as journalists, academics, and politicians either become engaged in partisan storytelling or else incur growing social, political, and economic costs. Electorates lose confidence in public institutions. Support for norms and democracy decline. It becomes increasingly difficult for people to act in a morally principled fashion by appealing to the truth or acting in line with one&#x27;s values when it conflicts with one&#x27;s party interests. Once pernicious polarization takes hold, it takes on a life of its own, regardless of earlier intentions.

===Benefits of polarization===
Several political scientists have argued that most types of political polarization are beneficial to democracy, as well as a natural feature. The simplifying features of polarization can help democratization. Strategies which depend on opposition and exclusion are present in all forms of observed politics. Political polarization can help transform or disrupt the status quo, sometimes addressing injustices or imbalances in a popular vs. oligarchic struggle.

Political polarization can serve to unify, invigorate, or mobilize potential allies at the elite and mass levels. It can also help to divide, weaken, or pacify competitors. Even the most celebrated social movements can be described as a &quot;group of people involved in a conflict with clearly defined opponents having a conflictual orientation toward an opponent and a common identity.&quot;

Political polarization can also provide voting heuristics to help voters choose among candidates, enabling political parties to mobilize supporters and provide programmatic choices. Polarizing politics can also help to overcome internal differences and frame a common identity, based in part on a common opposition to those resisting reforms. Still, polarization can be a risky political tool even when intended as an instrument of democratization, as it risks turning pernicious and self-propagating.

<doc id="584327" wikidata="Q5732280" url="?curid=584327" title="Soft-point bullet">
<text>A soft-point bullet (SP), also known as a soft-nosed bullet, is a jacketed expanding bullet with a soft metal core enclosed by a stronger metal jacket left open at the forward tip. A soft-point bullet is intended to expand upon striking flesh to cause a wound diameter greater than the bullet diameter. Jacketed soft point bullets are usually abbreviated &quot;JSP&quot; in the ammunition and reloading industry. The use of soft-point bullets in warfare is a violation of the Hague Convention of 1899, declaration IV, 3.

==Evolution==
Lead-alloy bullets used with gunpowder firearms were unsatisfactory at the bullet velocities available from rifles loaded with nitrocellulose propellants such as cordite. By the late 19th century, lead-alloy bullets were being enclosed within a jacket of stronger mild steel or copper alloyed with nickel or zinc to reliably impart stabilizing rotation in rifled barrels. The lead-alloy core was swaged into a cup of the stronger metal covering the front and sides of the core, but leaving some of the core exposed on the base of the bullet. The bullet jacket may be described as a metal envelope, steel envelope, or hard envelope; and the jacketed bullet may be described as metal-covered, metal-patched, or metal-cased.
But while these new types of projectile were easier to stabilize at the new high velocities, it was discovered that the new jacketed design was actually less lethal than the softer lead-alloy types that had preceded it. 

The jacketed bullets were typically of smaller diameter than the previous lead-alloy type, and the stronger jacket made them less likely to be deformed on impact. Such deformation increases the effective diameter of the projectile and can also cause an erratic trajectory within the wound. Enclosing the lead or alloy within a hard jacket cuts down on these tendencies despite the greater velocities employed, and this in conjunction with the typically smaller calibre created a greater tendency for the new rifle bullets both to create a smaller wound and to pass through, rather than lodging within, the anatomy of the target whether human or animal, thus increasing the probability of wounding rather than killing. For this reason, full metal jacket rounds are considered more humane for military purposes, since it is only necessary to incapacitate enemy soldiers to neutralize them on the battlefield; conversely, they are less effective for hunting animals where killing the quarry swiftly is the objective. To produce a smokeless-propellant round that would engage in rifling efficiently but also match or exceed the lethality of the old, low-velocity ammunition it was necessary to invent the soft-point. The process was not difficult: reversing the direction of jacket placement leaves the lead-alloy core exposed at the forward tip of the projectile creating a soft-point bullet.

==Expansion==

Soft-point bullets expose the soft lead-alloy core on the forward part of the bullet most likely to be deformed when striking a target. The sides of the bullet remain covered by the jacket to reliably impart stabilizing rotation from rifling. Expansion of a soft-point bullet depends upon the hardness of the lead-alloy core, the strength of the surrounding metal jacket, and the energy available from the decrease in bullet velocity as the bullet encounters target resistance. A core of pure lead is softer than a core of lead alloyed with metals like antimony and tin. Some jacket alloys have greater tensile strength than others; and, for any given alloy and annealing process, a thicker jacket will be stronger than a thinner jacket. Energy available to expand the bullet is proportional to the square of the velocity at which the bullet strikes the target. If the bullet passes through the target, the energy represented by the square of the velocity of the departing bullet has no effect on the target. Soft point bullets may not expand if they strike a target at low velocity, or if the target does not slow the bullet enough to deform the exposed point or rupture the surrounding jacket.

Varmint rifle bullets with thin jackets are intended to expand rapidly and disintegrate upon encountering minimum resistance. Bullets intended for big-game hunting are designed to increase their forward diameter while remaining intact to penetrate deeply enough to damage internal organs likely to cause rapid death. Big-game bullets sometimes have a specialized jacket including a center baffle between a forward core intended to expand and another core intended to remain intact. Alternative designs include a jacket with an internally thicker belt around the central part of the bullet intended to resist expansion while the thinner forward part of the bullet jacket ruptures. Some bullets have a core formed from a soft alloy in the forward part of the bullet bonded to a harder alloy core in the rear of the bullet. Others have a jacket which is thicker near the base of the bullet and tapers to a thin fringe adjacent to the soft point.

==Hollow-point bullets==

Soft-point bullets are similar to jacketed hollow-point bullets, because each has a jacket open on the forward tip. The soft core is exposed forward of the jacket on soft-point bullets, while the jacket may extend forward of the core on hollow-point bullets emphasizing aerodynamic improvement rather than expansion. Bullets with a large amount of core exposed forward of the jacket might have a hollow point within that core; and some hollow-point bullets have no jackets.

==Flat-point bullets==
Jacketed flat point (JFP) may describe either soft-point or full metal jacket bullets with a flat, rather than a rounded front. Until recently, flat-point bullets were required in centerfire rifles with tubular magazines, such as Winchester rifles, where the rounds are stored front-to-back. Use of metal-pointed bullets in these rifles can be highly dangerous, as the point of the bullet will rest against the primer of the round in front of it and can cause a detonation under the force of recoil. Since late 2005, newer bullet designs with polymer tips offering improved ballistics have become available for safe use in tubular magazine rifles.

<doc id="584341" wikidata="Q1502917" url="?curid=584341" title="Great Eastern Main Line">
<text>The Great Eastern Main Line (GEML, sometimes referred to as the East Anglia Main Line) is a major railway line on the British railway system which connects Liverpool Street station in central London with destinations in east London and the East of England, including , , , and . Its numerous branches also connect the main line to , , , Harwich and a number of coastal towns including Southend-on-Sea, , and .

Its main users are commuters travelling to and from London, particularly the City of London, which is served by Liverpool Street, and areas in east London, including the Docklands financial district via the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway connections at Stratford. The line is also heavily used by leisure travellers, as it and its branches serve a number of seaside resorts, shopping areas and countryside destinations. The route also provides the main artery for substantial freight traffic to and from and Harwich, via their respective branch lines. Trains from also run into London via the GEML.

The Elizabeth line, which fully opened in November 2022, operates services from Shenfield to London Paddington via Liverpool Street, connecting Essex with Central London and West London. Additionally, it provides a direct rail link between the GEML and the Great Western Main Line.

== History ==
===Eastern Counties and Eastern Union Railways (1839–1862)===
The first section of the line, built by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR), opened in June 1839 between a short-lived temporary terminus at in the East End of London and , then in the Havering Liberty in Essex. The London terminus was moved in July 1840 to Shoreditch (later renamed Bishopsgate), after 1900 in the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, and at the eastern end the line was extended out to in the same year. A further of track was added out to by 1843. The original gauge for the line was , but this was converted to in 1844.

The section of line between Colchester and was built by the Eastern Union Railway (EUR) to standard gauge and opened to passenger traffic in June 1846. Its sister company, the Ipswich and Bury Railway, built a line to and this was completed in November 1846. Both companies shared the same office, many directors and key staff, and started operating as a unified company with the EUR name from 1 January 1847. An extension from a new junction at to opened in December 1849, although the position of the latter station was poor and a spur to allow some trains to operate into (Thorpe) station was opened to regular traffic in November 1851.

In the late 19th century, the double-track main line was expanded with additional tracks being added to cope with more traffic. In 1854, a third track was added between Bow Junction and to help accommodate London, Tilbury and Southend Railway services which at that time were operating via Stratford.

Until 1860, trains serving the town of Ipswich used a station called which was located south of the Stoke tunnel. The town&#x27;s current station is located to the north of the tunnel.

The ECR had leased the EUR from 1854 but by the 1860s, the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble and most were leased to the ECR; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed out of the consolidation.

===Great Eastern Railway (1862–1922)===

From November 1872, became a temporary terminus to relieve the main high level Bishopsgate station while the GER was building its new permanent terminus at . The latter opened in stages from February 1874, beginning with the first four platforms, until it was fully open from November 1875. At that time the original 1840 Bishopsgate station closed to passengers and was converted into a goods yard.

By the 1870s, suburbia in the Forest Gate area was developing quickly and in 1872 suburban trains (this was the first distinctive suburban service on the main line as previously main-line trains had performed this duty) terminated at a bay platform at . These were followed by trains from Fenchurch Street in 1877. By 1882, these services had been extended and were terminating at Ilford, Romford or Brentwood.

In 1877, a fourth track was added between Bow Junction and Stratford and two goods-only tracks were added between Stratford and Maryland Point. The four-track Bow Junction to Stratford section was extended back to James Street Junction (near Globe Road station which opened the same year) in 1884, but Bethnal Green to James Street did not follow until 1891. It was also in this year that two extra tracks were added between Bethnal Green and Liverpool Street which were for the use of West Anglia Main Line services. These tracks were built through the basement warehousing associated with Bishopsgate station located above.

The line was quadrupled to Ilford in 1895, and in 1899 out to .

In 1902, the quadruple track was extended from Seven Kings to Romford, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1913 that four-tracking out to was suggested and the First World War caused delay to this plan. In 1903, the Fairlop Loop opened and a number of services that had previously terminated at Ilford were extended onto it. These services generally looped round and back to the GEML at Stratford (on the Cambridge line platforms).

===London and North Eastern Railway (1923–1947)===

The GER was grouped in 1923 into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). In 193132, the LNER quadrupled the tracks to Shenfield which became the terminus for inner-suburban operation.

In the 1930s, a flyover was constructed just west of to switch the main and electric lines over, to enable main-line trains to utilise Liverpool Street&#x27;s longer west side platforms without having to cross east side suburban traffic in the station throat. The new arrangement also facilitated cross-platform interchange with the Central line at , with services commencing in 1946. Either side of the Ilford flyover there are single-track connections between each pair of lines, with the westbound track extending to and just beyond. The eastbound track extends as far as Ilford station. It was also envisaged that a flyover would be built at the country-end of the carriage sidings at to allow trains bound for the Southend line to change from the main line to the electric line, instead of at the London-end of as they do now.

Plans were drawn up in the 1930s to electrify the suburban lines from Liverpool Street to Shenfield at 1,500VDC and work was started on implementing this. However, the outbreak of the Second World War brought the project to a temporary halt and it was not until 1949 that the scheme was completed with electrification being extended to in 1956.

During World War II, the long-distance named trains were withdrawn, and these returned after the war with the reintroduction of the &quot;Hook Continental&quot; and &quot;Scandinavian&quot; boat trains to Harwich Parkeston Quay in 1945. The East Anglian (Liverpool Street – Norwich) was restored in October 1946, and in 1947 the &quot;Day Continental&quot; which pre-war had operated as the &quot;Flushing Continental&quot;, recommenced operation.

===British Railways (1948–1994)===

After nationalisation in 1948, the GEML formed part of the Eastern Region of British Railways.

The Summer 1950 timetable saw the introduction of a regular interval service between Liverpool Street and Clacton, which left Liverpool Street on the half-hour and Clacton on the hour. Summer Saturdays in 1950 also saw the introduction of the &quot;Holiday Camps Express&quot; workings to Gorleston, near Lowestoft. The latter half of 1950 and early 1951 saw the testing of new EM1 electric locomotives for use over the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield.

January 1951 saw the introduction of the Britannia class 4-6-2 express locomotives and a speeding up of services on the GEML. However, not everyone was a fan; British Railways&#x27; chairman Sir Michael Barrington Ward exclaimed &quot;What? Send the first British Railways standard engines to that tramline? No!&quot;

Twenty-three Britannias were allocated to the GE section and, in summer 1951, the Liverpool Street–Norwich service went over to an hourly clockface interval service.

The British Railways 1955 Modernisation Plan called for overhead line systems in Great Britain to be standardised at 25kVAC. However, due to low clearances under bridges, the route was electrified at 6.25kVAC. The section between Liverpool Street and was completed in November 1960. Extensive testing showed that smaller electrical clearances could be tolerated for the 25kV system than originally thought necessary. As a result, it was now possible to increase the voltage without having to either raise bridges or lower the tracks along the route to obtain larger clearances. The route between Liverpool Street and Southend Victoria was converted to 25kV AC between 1976 and 1980.

By the late 1970s, the costs of running the dated mechanical signalling systems north of Colchester was recognised and, in 1978, a scheme for track rationalisation and re-signalling was duly submitted to the Department of Transport. This was followed by a proposal, in 1980, to electrify the remainder of the Great Eastern Main Line.

The early 1980s saw track rationalisation and signalling work carried out in the Ipswich area and, on 9 April 1985, the first electric train consisting of two Class 305 electric multiple units (EMUs) worked into Ipswich station. The previous year, another member of the class had been dragged to Ipswich by a diesel locomotive and was used for crew training. The first passenger-carrying train was formed of Class 309 EMUs, which ran on 17 April 1985.

InterCity electric-hauled trains commenced on the route on 1 May 1985. Class 86 locomotives initially only powered services between Liverpool Street and Ipswich; after a switchover, Class 47s would complete the journey between Ipswich and Norwich. This last section was finally energised in May 1987, when through electric services commenced.

In 1986, the line as far as became part of Network SouthEast, although some NSE services actually terminated at Ipswich, whilst longer-distance Norwich services were operated by InterCity. Local services operating from the Ipswich and Norwich areas were operated by Regional Railways.

===The privatisation era (1994 onwards)===

Between 1997 and 2004, services into Essex and some into Suffolk were operated by First Great Eastern, whilst services into Norfolk and other Suffolk services were operated by Anglia Railways. Between 2004 and 2012, services out of Liverpool Street, except for a limited number of c2c trains, were all operated by National Express East Anglia. Since 2012, the franchise has been operated by Abellio Greater Anglia; in May 2015, the Shenfield &quot;metro&quot; stopping service transferred to TfL Rail, as a precursor to Elizabeth Line services.

Liverpool Street IECC replaced signal boxes at Bethnal Green (closed 1997), Bow (closed 1996), Stratford (GE panel closed 1997), Ilford (closed 1996), Romford (closed 1998), Gidea Park (closed 1998), Shenfield (closed 1992) and Chelmsford (closed 1994). The system uses BR Mark 3 solid state interlockings, predominantly four-aspect signals and a combination of Smiths clamp-lock and GEC-Alsthom HW2000 point machines.

The first signal box to be closed and transferred to Liverpool Street IECC was Shenfield in 1992, which had only opened 10 years earlier. The last boxes to be transferred were at Romford and Gidea Park in 1998; these were the oldest of those being transferred, having been opened under the GER/LNER 1924 resignalling scheme.

==Accidents and incidents==
A number of fatal accidents have occurred on the line throughout its history:

* 1840: ; four killed
* 1872: ; one killed and 16 injured in a derailment
* 1905: Witham; 11 killed and 71 injured in a derailment
* 1913: ; three killed and 14 injured in a collision and derailment
* 1915: Ilford; 10 killed and 500 injured in a collision between two trains
* 1941: Brentwood; seven killed in a collision between two trains
* 1944: Ilford; nine killed and 38 injured in a collision between two trains
* 1944: ; one killed and three injured in a collision between two trains

== Infrastructure ==
The line is owned and maintained by Network Rail. It is part of Network Rail Strategic Route 7, which is composed of SRSs 07.01, 07.02 and 07.03, and is classified as a primary line. The GEML has a loading gauge of W10 between Liverpool Street and Haughley Junction (approximately 13 miles 63 chains north of Ipswich) and from there is W9 to Norwich. The maximum line speed is .

Between and , there is a Network Rail maintenance depot adjacent to the Jutsums Lane overbridge. In addition, at the London-end of the depot, is Network Rail&#x27;s Electrical Control Room that controls the supply and switching of the overhead line system for the whole of the former Anglia Region.

Signalling is controlled by two main signalling centres: Liverpool Street IECC (opened in 1992) and Colchester PSB (opened in December 1983). Liverpool Street IECC controls signalling up to , where it fringes with Colchester PSB, which has control to . There are also several small signal boxes that control local infrastructure, such as Ingatestone box, which has jurisdiction over several local level crossings.

Line-side train monitoring equipment includes hot axle box detectors (HABD) on the down main and down electric lines near Brentwood (17 miles 35 chains from Liverpool Street) and on the up main near Margaretting (25 miles 78 chains). Other equipment includes wheel impact load detectors (WILD) ‘Wheelchex’ on the down main and up main west of Church Lane level crossing (24 miles 75 chains).

=== Track layout ===
On leaving Liverpool Street, the route comprises two pairs of tracks, known as the mains and the electrics, with a further pair of tracks, the suburbans, which carry the West Anglia Main Line alongside the GEML to .

From Bethnal Green, the GEML has four lines to Bow junction, where there is a complex set of switches and crossings. A line from the LTS (Fenchurch Street) route joins the &quot;up&quot; (London-bound) electric and there are a further two lines, the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; Temple Mills, giving access to the North London Line and Temple Mills. The GEML has six tracks up to the London-end of and the junction to Temple Mills; there are five lines through the station, dropping to four at the country end.

At , the line to diverges and the main-line route drops from four tracks to two; this arrangement continues for the vast majority of the way to Norwich. There are several locations where the route has more than two tracks, predominantly through stations such as Colchester and Ipswich, along with goods loops, such as at the London end of . There is also a short stretch of single track on approach to Norwich, as the line passes over the River Wensum on the Trowse Bridge.

=== Tunnel and viaducts ===
Major civil engineering structures on the Great Eastern Main Line include the following:
====Stoke tunnel====
The only tunnel on the line is immediately south of station. The long tunnel was built by Peter Bruff as part of the Ipswich &amp; Bury Railway. It was completed in 1846 and it is thought to be the earliest driven on a sharp continuous curve. During the excavation of the tunnel, many important fossils were discovered, including rhinoceros, lion and mammoth; the site was known as the &quot;Stoke Bone Beds&quot;. The finds are considered important in understanding climate change during the Ice Age. This tunnel had the trackbed lowered so the line could accommodate taller freight trains.

=== Electrification ===
The main line is electrified at 25 kV AC 50hz using overhead wires under the control of Romford Electrical Control Room. The branches to , , , , , and are also electrified. The history of electrification on the GEML and adjoining routes is unusually complicated with parts of the line having been electrified with three different systems. Due to this, as well as traffic demands growing throughout the 21st century, the traction supply feeding arrangements are complex and somewhat unintuitive with several seemingly redundant features.

The earliest stretch of electrification was between Liverpool Street (only platforms 11–18) to Shenfield along with the branch from Fenchurch Street (platforms 1 and 2) down the Bow Curve in 1949. This was an overhead line system (OLE) at 1.5kV DC and was extended to Chelmsford and Southend Victoria in 1956. Over the weekend of the 5th and 6th of November 1960, the system was converted to 6.25kV AC at mains frequency (50hz) between Liverpool Street and Southend Victoria, with the wires from Shenfield to Chelmsford taken out of use to be converted to 25kV AC until re-energisation on the 20th March 1961.(although passenger service with electric trains did not return until the next year). The low voltage AC utilised broadly the same substations, grid connections, OLE components and electrical clearances as the previous DC system. At around the same time, the rest of the platforms and lines out of Liverpool Street (the Lea Valley lines) and out of Fenchurch Street were electrified also at 6.25kV AC in November 1960 and November 1961 respectively.

After this point, electrification was extended up the Great Eastern Main Line and on several branches all at 25kV AC. The line from Colchester to Clacton-on-Sea and Walton-on-the-Naze was previously electrified in 1959 at 25kV AC and the gap was filled between Colchester and Chelmsford in 18th June 1962. From 1975 until 1988, all the sections of 6.25kV AC around London and Southend across all lines in the Anglia region were converted to 25kV AC requiring new substations and significant modifications to the OLE components. In 2022, a small section between Bow Junction and Gidea Park was upgraded to a 2x25kV AC autotransformer system in order to support the Elizabeth Line service. The full timeline for the electrification on the GEML and branches is summarised below. 

====Historic 6.25kV/25kV voltage changeover====
Since trains would through-run between 6.25kV and 25kV sections in regular operation, all EMUs built for the Anglia region between 1960 and 1980 were fitted for dual AC voltage with equipment to automatically switch between the two power systems while running. The main transformer on the train had four identical primary windings which could be connected in series for 25 kV working, or in parallel for 6.25kV working, by means of a &quot;supply changeover switch&quot;. It was vital that the changeover switch was in the correct position since, if the voltage was too low, the train could not operate, while if the voltage was too high, serious damage could occur. For this reason, the switchover had to be made automatically by way of voltage sensing equipment rather than rely on the driver operating controls.

At the points where the two systems met – such as on the main line just east of Shenfield – there was a short length of overhead line which was electrically neutral. Neutral sections were installed either at breaks between supply areas or where the two voltages met. Whether or not the voltage was different on the other side of the neutral section, the on-train equipment operated in exactly the same way. At each end of the neutral section there were track-mounted permeant magnets referred to as Automatic Power Control (APC) magnets.

On board the train, the operation of the dual-voltage mechanism depended on the action of the main air-blast circuit breaker and voltage-sensing relays. When passing the first APC magnet, detection equipment fitted to the bogies would activate the circuit breaker cutting all power to the train. Once the train had passed the neutral section, the second set of APC magnets are detected by the bogie-mounted inducers which causes a lock to be released on the circuit breaker meaning its reclosing would be under the control of the voltage-detection equipment. This consisted of four voltage relays that would allow for a line voltage between 4.1 and 6.9kV for the low-voltage mode, and 16.5 to 27.5kV for the high-voltage mode. If the first relay was tripped, the changeover switch at the transformer was set to the low-voltage mode and the circuit breaker closed. All four relays were activated if the voltage was above 16.5kV. In that case, the current was sent to a magnetic switch that would set the changeover switch at the transformer to the 25kV position.

The other relays were installed to stop the changeover switch from being activated to low-voltage mode if the line voltage fell under 16.5kV but greater than 6.9kV. The changeover system was interlocked with the circuit breaker and the action of the APC magnets since any movement of the changeover switch while the circuit breaker was closed and connecting the system to any live current would cause destructive arcing for the internal components. Following testing and some in service incidents, modifications were made to the changeover equipment such that a switch to the low-voltage mode could only be made when the line voltage had dropped to below 3kV and then risen to 4.1kV, and that the re-closing of the circuit breaker is only made after a two-second wait following the detection of the second APC magnet to ensure a correct reading of the voltage.

As well as new EMUs introduced after 1960, the previous class 306 and 307 units originally built for the 1.5kV DC system underwent conversion to become 6.25/25kV dual-mode EMUs. The conversion of both these classes of train involved significant interventions particularly the relocating of the pantograph to a different carriage and the associated internal layout changes this caused. The full 92-unit fleet of class 306s and the 32 units of class 307 fleet underwent alterations at Stratford Works with new equipment provided by Associated Electrical Industries at Manchester.

Neutral sections are, or course, still required on the modern 25kV system and APC magnets are still used to automatically trigger the opening of the train&#x27;s circuit breaker so that an arc is not caused at OLE when the pantograph travels between live and earthed wire.

==== Feeding arrangements ====
The majority of the GEML network is electrified using the &#x27;classic&#x27; feeding arrangement connected to the 132kV distribution grid all controlled by UK Power Networks. In accordance with the Crossrail project, autotransformer feeding was fitted between the new autotransformer feeder station (ATFS) at Pudding Mill Lane and Gidea Park. Pudding Mill Lane ATFS also feeds the Crossrail core from that point to the Westbourne Park tunnel portal and towards Abbey Wood. This entirely replaced Crowlands classic feeder station (located between Chadwell Heath and Romford) and significantly reduced the load of the Bow Junction classic feeder station. The feeder station is connected to the National Grid 400kV transmission substation also named Pudding Mill Lane.

The line between Gidea Park and Shenfield is fitted out to be converted to autotransformer feeding in the near future with a sectioning autotransformer station (SATS) already completed at Shenfield in 2018. Autotransformer feeding is also due to be extended as far as Beulieu Park as a new ATFS is being constructed just north of the station at the same site as the Springfield classic feeder station.

The original 1.5kV DC system of 1949 used traction substations at Bethnal Green, Stratford, Chadwell Heath, Gidea Park, and Shenfield all supplied by 33kV 3 phase AC distribution ring owned and operated by the railway. The 33kV ring was itself supplied by the utility grid at Chadwell Heath and Crosswall (near Fenchurch Street). Beyond Shenfield, the DC system installed in 1956 to Chelmsford and Southend Victoria did not use the railway distribution lines but were connected directly to the public utility grid at 33kV. Between Liverpool Street and Shenfield, the DC substations were significantly altered but retained for the conversion to 6.25kV in 1960 but were unsuitable for the further upgrades to 25kV. So too were the 33kV distribution lines which were reinforced by replacing the Crosswall grid connection with a stronger one at Bethnal Green. However after 1960, the distribution lines no longer powered Shenfield substation as a new feeder station was built that could supply both 6.25kV southwards and on the Southend line and 25kV for the line north to Chelmsford and for the future upgrade.

From 1976 to 1980 the 6.25kV lines between Liverpool Street and Southend Victoria were upgraded to 25kV which required entirely new grid connections and substations. New feeder stations were installed at Crowlands and at Bow Junction. The substation at Gidea Park became the MPTSC between Shenfield and Crowlands, and a brand new MPTSC was installed at Manor Park to separate Crowlands and Bow Junction feeder stations. Bow Junction feeder station also supplied the WAML up to a new MPTSC at Hackney Downs by way of a new Spitalfields TSC around Bethnal Green junction.
=== Rolling stock ===
====Inter-city====
Steam-hauled inter-city trains on the London-Norwich service were replaced by diesel power in the 1960s; locomotives from classes 40, 37 and 47 hauled services until the mid-1980s.

Electric locomotives replaced diesel haulage from the mid-1980s, when the remainder of the GEML was electrified north of Colchester; their utilisation continued until March 2020. Class 86 locomotives powered the service from 1985 until 2005, with rakes of Mark 2 coaches. Push-pull services were introduced during their tenure, initially using a DBSO coach at the Norwich end and latterly with Mark 3 Driving Van Trailers, cascaded from the West Coast Main Line. From 2004, Class 90 locomotives replaced the ageing Class 86s and rolling stock was updated with refurbished former West Coast Main Line Mark 3 coaches, following the introduction of the Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; stock on that route.

By March 2020, new EMUs had fully replaced Class 90 and Mark 3 coaches; thereby ending locomotive operation on the inter-city services on the Great Eastern Main Line.

====Suburban====
Electric multiple units are used for inner and outer suburban passenger trains and diesel multiple units are used on non-electrified branch lines. The main passenger units utilised are:

*: 450 seats across nine cars. Maximum speed . (Operated by Elizabeth Line)
*: 757 seats across 12 cars. Maximum speed . (Operated by Greater Anglia)
*Class 720: 545 seats across five cars. . (Operated by Greater Anglia)
*: 167 seats across three cars (class 755/3) or 229 seats across four cars (class 755/4). Maximum speed . (Operated by Greater Anglia)
On weekends and when engineering work occurs, c2c run services into Liverpool Street via Stratford using Class 357 electric multiple units (EMU).

====Freight====
Freight services also operate frequently on the Great Eastern Main Line, with its easy access to the Port of Felixstowe. A pool of Class 90s, including most of the locomotives that operated inter-city services on the GEML, provide electric haulage with Class 66 and Class 70 providing diesel power.

==Current developments==

===Crossrail===

In 2015, TfL Rail, the precursor of Crossrail, took over operation of the Shenfield stopping &quot;metro&quot; service and, from 2022, the full Crossrail service will run via a tunnel through central London and link up with the Great Western Main Line to and Heathrow Airport.

The first new rolling stock entered service on the service on 22 June 2017. The new trains, built at Bombardier&#x27;s Derby factory, provide air conditioned walk-through carriages, intelligent lighting and temperature control, closed-circuit television and passenger information displays showing travel information, including about onward journeys. It was planned that by September 2017, half of the services between Shenfield and Liverpool Street will have switched to the new Class 345 trains. From May 2015, Crossrail services (re-branded as TfL Rail) have an interchange with existing GEML services at Liverpool Street (via new underground platforms) as well as , and .

In November 2022, Crossrail services began to operate between Shenfield and London Paddington via Farringdon. However no services operate further than Paddington onto the likes of Heathrow Airport and Reading. Instead, these services start from Abbey Wood, the Elizabeth line&#x27;s southeast branch.

==Proposed developments==
A new station is planned at Great Blakenham as part of the SnOasis development approximately halfway between and , Another is planned at Beaulieu, 3 miles north-east of Chelmsford entailing a long section of extra tracks on viaduct/bridge.

== Services ==
The majority of trains are operated by Abellio Greater Anglia, with the Elizabeth line operating the Liverpool Street to Shenfield stopping &quot;metro&quot; trains. A limited number of weekend (and when engineering work is planned) c2c services, operate on part of the line between Stratford and Liverpool Street.

===Main line===

Fast and semi-fast services utilise the main line between Liverpool Street and Shenfield. Branch lines diverge at Romford, Shenfield, Witham, Marks Tey, Colchester, Ipswich, Stowmarket and Norwich.

Additionally, a very limited number of main-line services call at Ilford, Seven Kings and Gidea Park during early mornings and late nights, often for the convenience of train drivers who may be working from these locations.

† Needham Market is not served by main-line trains.

=== Electric line ===
The Elizabeth line is a high-frequency service that operates between London Paddington and via London Liverpool Street since 2022 and serves all stations.

In 2006 the off-peak stopping service on the Great Eastern Main Line consisted of six trains per hour, with some additional services during peak times. During peak times, some trains start or terminate at . The line is mostly within Greater London, with two stations in the Essex borough of Brentwood.

The electric line is also used by limited services extending to and from .
==Passenger volume==
These are the passenger usage statistics from the year beginning April 2002 to the year beginning April 2013 and for those beginning April 2016 to April 2022. Needham Market is the only station on the line that is not served by trains to/from London.

<text>The Great Western Main Line (GWML) is a main line railway in England that runs westwards from London Paddington to . It connects to other main lines such as those from Reading to Penzance and Swindon to Swansea. The GWML is presently a part of the national rail system managed by Network Rail while the majority of passenger services upon it are provided by the current Great Western Railway franchise.

The GWML was built by the original Great Western Railway company between 1838 and 1841, as a dual track line in the broad gauge. The broad gauge remained in use until 1892, after which standard gauge track has been exclusively used. Between 1877 and 1932, many sections of the GWML were widened to four tracks. During 1908, Automatic Train Control (ATC) was introduced as a safety measure. In 1948, the Great Western Railway, and thus the GWML, was merged into the Western Region of British Railways.

During the 1970s, the GWML was upgraded to support higher line speeds, as a result of which many sections permitted operations, enabling the newly introduced InterCity 125 high speed train (HST) to make faster journeys. British Rail proposed widespread electrification of the line in the late 1970s, although this was not speedily implemented. During the mid-1990s, a stretch of the GWML between London Paddington and Hayes &amp; Harlington was electrified using overhead lines for the Heathrow Express. Further, although not total, electrification was carried out during the 2010s; this permitted the replacement of diesel-powered trains such as the InterCity 125 and with electric and bi-mode train sets such as the Hitachi Super Express high speed trains, specifically the and . Due to budget overruns, the British government deferred electrification of the section through Bath Spa from Royal Wootton Bassett to Bristol in 2016.

Communities served by the GWML include West London (including Acton, Ealing, Hanwell, Southall, Hayes, Harlington and West Drayton); Iver; Langley; Slough; Burnham; Taplow; Maidenhead; Twyford; Reading; Tilehurst; Pangbourne; Goring-on-Thames; Streatley; Cholsey; Didcot; Swindon; Chippenham; Bath; Keynsham; and Bristol. The route includes dozens of listed buildings and structures, including tunnel portals, bridges and viaducts, stations, and associated hotels. Presently, the GWML is electrified between London Paddington and Royal Wootton Bassett. In the long term, Network Rail plans to install European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) in-cab signalling across the entire line.

==History==
===Construction===
The construction of what would become the GWML was motivated by several factors, one of the more influential being the sizeable merchant community of Bristol, which keenly advocated for such a railway to be built to help maintain the city&#x27;s position as the second port of the country as well as the chief one for American trade. More specifically, fearing rising competition from Liverpool and railway developments to its favour, the sought railway was to be preferably built to superior standards as to out-perform any of the lines serving the North West of England. Thus, the line built by the Great Western Railway and engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel was originally a dual track line using a wider broad gauge. The line&#x27;s construction costs were considerably higher due to the use of this broad gauge.

The route of the GWML includes dozens of listed buildings and structures, including tunnel portals, bridges and viaducts, stations, and associated hotels. Part of the route passes through and contributes to the Georgian Architecture of the City of Bath World Heritage Site; the path through Sydney Gardens has been described as a &quot;piece of deliberate railway theatre by Brunel without parallel&quot;. Grade I listed structures on the line include London Paddington, Wharncliffe Viaduct, the 1839 Tudor gothic River Avon Bridge in Bristol, and Bristol Temple Meads station.

The line was opened in stages between 1838 and 1841. The first section, between Paddington Station and Maidenhead Bridge station opened on 4 June 1838, while the final section, between Chippenham and Bath, was opened on completion of the Box Tunnel, the longest railway tunnel driven by that time, in June 1841. The line&#x27;s alignment was so level and straight it was nicknamed &quot;Brunel&#x27;s billiard table&quot;.

===Changes under the Great Western Railway===
The track was supplemented with a third rail for dual gauge operation, allowing standard gauge trains to also operate on the route, in stages between 1854 and 1875. Dual gauge was introduced as follows: London to Reading (October 1861), Reading to (December 1856), Didcot to (February 1872), Swindon to Thingley Junction, (June 1874), Thingley Junction to (March 1875), Bathampton to Bristol (June 1874), Bristol station area (May 1854). The broad gauge remained in use until 1892, at which point the last 500 miles of track were converted to standard gauge.

Between 1877 and 1899, the original dual tracks were widened to four in numerous places, mainly in the east half of the line: Paddington to (October 1877), Southall to (November 1878), West Drayton to (June 1879), Slough to east side of Maidenhead Bridge (September 1884), Maidenhead Bridge to (June 1893), Reading station (1899), Reading to (July 1893), Pangbourne to Cholsey and Moulsford (June 1894), Cholsey and Moulsford to Didcot (December 1892); also short sections between Didcot and Swindon, and at Bristol.

Following the Slough rail accident of 1900, in which five passengers were killed, improved vacuum braking systems were used on locomotives and passenger rolling stock; furthermore, Automatic Train Control (ATC) was introduced in 1908.

Further widenings of the line took place between 1903 and 1910; another round of widening works occurred between 1931 and 1932. By the 1930s, trains traversing the GWML were reportedly attaining the highest average speeds in the world.

A legacy of the broad gauge was that trains for some routes could be built slightly wider than was normal in Britain; examples included the 1929-built &quot;Super Saloons&quot; used on the boat train services that conveyed transatlantic passengers to London in luxury. When the company celebrated its centenary during 1935, new &quot;Centenary&quot; carriages were built for the Cornish Riviera Express, which again made full use of the wider loading gauge on that route.

At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the Great Western Railway, and thus the GWML, was taken into government control, as were most major railways in Britain. After the conflict, the companies were reorganised into the &quot;big four&quot; companies, of which the Great Western Railway was one. The railways, including the GWML, returned to direct government control during the Second World War before being nationalised to form British Railways (BR) in 1948, thus bringing the line into public ownership.

===British Rail era===
Unlike the other BR regions, which introduced diesel-electric locomotives, the Western Region, to which the GWML belonged, decided to procure a complete range of diesel-hydraulic locomotives to fulfil its type 1 to type 4 power requirements. These included the &quot;Warship&quot; locomotives, which were based on proven West German designs, the British-designed Class 14, &quot;Hymek&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; types. However, these were all eventually withdrawn and replaced with more standard British Rail diesel-electric classes such as the Class 37 and Class 47.

During the 1970s, the line speed of the GWML was upgraded to permit faster operations; this work was in preparation for the introduction of the InterCity 125 high speed train (HST). The HST brought about considerable improvements in service and reduced journey times.

In 1977, the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended considering electrification of more of Britain&#x27;s rail network and, by 1979, British Rail had presented a range of options that included electrifying the line from Paddington to Swansea by 2000. Under the 1979–90 Conservative governments that succeeded the 1976–79 Labour government, the proposal was not implemented.

In the mid-1990s, the line between London Paddington and Hayes &amp; Harlington was electrified as part of the Heathrow Express scheme, which was officially launched in June 1998.

===Privatisation era===
As part of the privatisation of British Rail, the Great Western InterCity franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to Great Western Holdings in December 1995, and it began operations on 4 February 1996. Via multiple contract extensions, this operator, which currently trades as Great Western Railway has been the primary operator of passenger services on the GWML for multiple decades.

In August 2008, it was announced that a number of speed limits on the relief lines between Reading and London had been raised, so that 86% of the line could be used at .

By 2019, the partial electrification of the GWML permitted the replacement of InterCity 125 and sets by new Hitachi Super Express high speed trains – the and . The procurement programme for these trains, known as the Intercity Express Programme, was highly impacted by the GWML&#x27;s electrification scheme, particularly the abandonment of diesel-only trains in favour of bi-mode trains, which were elongated and outfitted with a second transformer to maximise their use of the electrified sections. The electrification of the line also allowed the introduction of other rolling stock, such as EMUs, to conduct shorter-distance services.

==Route==
Communities served by the Great Western Main Line include West London (including Acton, Ealing, Hanwell, Southall, Hayes, Harlington and West Drayton); Iver; Langley; Slough; Burnham; Taplow; Maidenhead; Twyford; Reading; Tilehurst; Pangbourne; Goring-on-Thames; Streatley; Cholsey; Didcot; Swindon; Chippenham; Bath; Keynsham; and Bristol.

From London to Didcot, the line follows the Thames Valley, crossing the River Thames three times, including on the Maidenhead Railway Bridge. Between Chippenham and Bath the line passes through Box Tunnel, and then follows the valley of the River Avon.

A junction west of Swindon allows trains to reach Bristol by an alternative route along the South Wales Main Line. Other diversionary routes exist between Chippenham and Bath via and the Wessex Main Line, although this involves a reversal at Bradford Junction; and from Reading to Bath via the Reading–Taunton line.

==Services==
Most services are provided by Great Western Railway (GWR). The stations served by trains between London Paddington and Bristol Temple Meads are , , , , and . Some trains between London and Bristol do not call at Didcot Parkway.

The Elizabeth line runs on the Great Western Main Line between London and Reading.

Fast Heathrow Express trains from Paddington to London Heathrow Airport are operated by GWR on behalf of Heathrow Airport Holdings.

CrossCountry operate trains between Reading and Oxford, using the Great Western Main Line as far as Didcot.

Great Western Railway also operate a train between London Paddington – Cardiff Central every 30minutes, with hourly extensions to Swansea. At Swansea/Cardiff there is a connecting Transport for Wales boat train to/from Fishguard Harbour for the Stena Line ferry to Rosslare Europort in Ireland. An integrated timetable is offered between London Paddington and Rosslare Europort with through ticketing available. Daytime and nocturnal journeys are offered in both directions daily (including Sundays).

==Infrastructure==

Between London and Didcot there are four tracks, two for each direction. The main lines are mostly used by the faster trains and are on the south side of the route. The relief lines on the north side are used for slower services and those that call at all stations, as only London Paddington, Slough, Maidenhead, Twyford, Reading and Didcot Parkway stations have platforms on the main lines (although a few others have main line platforms that can be used in an emergency). Between Didcot and Royal Wootton Bassett, a series of passing loops allow fast trains to overtake slower ones. This section is signalled for bi-directional running on each line but this facility is usually only used during engineering working or when there is significant disruption to traffic in one direction.

The summit of the line is at Swindon, and falls away in each direction: Swindon is above Paddington, and above Bristol Temple Meads. The maximum gradient between Paddington and Didcot is 1 in 1320 (0.75‰ or 0.075%); between Didcot and Swindon it is 1 in 660 (1.5‰ or 0.15%) but west of Swindon, gradients as steep as 1 in 100 (10‰ or 1%) are found in places, such as Box Tunnel and to the east of .

The line is electrified between Paddington and Langley Burrell (just east of Chippenham) using overhead supply lines; the Reading to Taunton line (as far as Newbury) and the South Wales Main Line (as far as Cardiff Central) are also electrified.

The line speed is . The relief lines from Paddington to Didcot are limited to as far as Reading, and then to Didcot. Lower restrictions apply at various locations. The line is one of two Network Rail-owned lines equipped with the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, the other being the Chiltern Main Line.

=== Tunnels, viaducts and major bridges ===
Major civil engineering structures on the Great Western Main Line include the following.
==== Line-side monitoring equipment ====
Line-side train monitoring equipment includes hot axle box detectors (HABD) and &#x27;Wheelchex&#x27; wheel impact load detectors (WILD), sited as follows.
==Recent developments==

Since 2011, the Great Western has been undergoing a £5billion modernisation by Network Rail.

Reading railway station saw a major redevelopment with new platforms, a new entrance, footbridge and lifts; the work was completed a year ahead of schedule in July 2014.

===Electrification===
The eastern section from Paddington to was electrified in 1998. The Crossrail project covered electrification of the line from Airport Junction to Maidenhead and, following a number of announcements and delays, the government announced in March 2011 that it would electrify the line as far as Bristol Temple Meads.

Following delays to the work and a large increase in costs, the Conservative government announced in July 2017 that, for the time being, electrification would only be completed as far as Thingley Junction, west of Chippenham. Electrification as far as Didcot Parkway was completed in December 2017, and to Thingley Junction in December 2019.

Electrification of associated lines, including Bristol Parkway to Temple Meads and Didcot to Oxford, was also postponed indefinitely; electrification of the route between London and Cardiff was completed in 2019. The government argued that bi-mode trains would fill in the gaps pending completion of electrification, although the Class 800 trains are slower in diesel mode than under electric power.

===Other proposals===
Network Rail plans to install European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) in-cab signalling on the Great Western line; this is a pre-requisite for the Super Express trains to run at 140mph (225km/h). Some of this resignalling work was undertaken during the electrification work. Furthermore, Network Rail has envisaged the deployment of ERTMS to function as the replacement for the aging ATP system.

Further capacity improvements are also scheduled at Swindon, adding to recent changes and the new Platform 4.

Crossrail services are planned to terminate at Reading. Some of the current suburban services into London Paddington are planned to be transferred to the new Crossrail service, which will free up some surface-level capacity at Paddington.

Other more distant aspirations include resignalling and capacity improvements at Reading; the provision of four continuous tracks between Didcot and Swindon (including a grade-separated junction at Milton, where the westbound relief line switches from the north side of the line to the south); and resignalling between Bath and Bristol to enable trains to run closer together.

Access to Heathrow Airport from the west remains an aspiration and the 2009 Heathrow Airtrack scheme, abandoned in 2011, proposed a route south of the Great Western Main Line to link the airport with Reading. Plans for electrification of the line will make it easier to access Heathrow from Reading, since lack of electrification between Reading station and Airport Junction (near West Drayton station) was a limiting factor. Plans under consideration in 2014 included new tunnels between Heathrow and Langley.

Signalling Solutions is to resignal the from Paddington to , including the Airport branch, as part of the Crossrail project.

===Calls for station reopenings===
There are calls for the reintroduction of Corsham station due to recent growth of the town. The original station was closed to passengers in 1965.

A local group is campaigning for the reopening of Saltford station between Bath and Bristol, to coincide with electrification.

There have also been calls to reopen the former Wantage Road station. Oxfordshire County Council included a proposal for a new station to serve Wantage and Grove in their 2015–2031 local transport plan.

==Major incidents==
* Slough rail accident – 16 June 1900 – An express train from Paddington to ran through two sets of signals at danger and collided with a local train heading for Windsor. Five passengers were killed and 35 seriously injured.
* Ealing rail crash – 19 December 1973 – A train from Paddington to Oxford derailed after a loose battery box cover on the Class 52 &quot;Western&quot; locomotive hauling the train struck lineside equipment, causing a set of points to move under the train. Ten passengers were killed and 94 injured.
* Southall rail crash – 19 September 1997 – An InterCity 125 service from to Paddington, operated by Great Western Trains, failed to stop at a red signal and collided with a freight train entering Southall goods yard. Seven people were killed and 139 were injured. The incident severely damaged public confidence in the safety of the rail system. It was found that the train&#x27;s automatic warning system (AWS) was faulty, and the driver had been distracted (he had bent down to pack his bag). Great Western Trains was fined £1.5million for violations of health and safety law in connection with the accident.
* Ladbroke Grove rail crash – 5 October 1999 – A Thames Trains service from Paddington to passed a signal at danger at the gantry protecting a main set of (crossover) points between the one-way and bi-directionally used lines. The train ran the wrong way down the line and was hit head-on by a First Great Western HST service from to Paddington at a closing speed of approximately . 31people died, including both drivers, with more than 520people injured. Thames Trains was fined £2million for violations of health and safety law. Railtrack pleaded guilty to charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 in relation to the accident. It was subsequently fined £4million and was also ordered to pay £225,000 in costs.

<doc id="584350" wikidata="Q2370273" url="?curid=584350" title="Operation Mockingbird">
<text>Operation Mockingbird is an alleged large-scale program of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that began in the early years of the Cold War and attempted to manipulate domestic American news media organizations for propaganda purposes. According to author Deborah Davis, Operation Mockingbird recruited leading American journalists into a propaganda network and influenced the operations of front groups. CIA support of front groups was exposed when an April 1967 &quot;Ramparts&quot; article reported that the National Student Association received funding from the CIA. In 1975, Church Committee Congressional investigations revealed Agency connections with journalists and civic groups.

In 1973, a document referred to as the &quot;Family Jewels&quot; was published by the CIA containing a reference to a different operation named &quot;Project Mockingbird&quot;, which was the name of an operation in 1963 which wiretapped two syndicated columnists, Robert Allen and Paul Scott, &quot;from March 12 to June 15, 1963&quot;. They had published articles based on classified material. The document does not contain references to &quot;Operation Mockingbird&quot;.

==Background==

In the early years of the Cold War, efforts were made by the United States Government to use mass media to influence public opinion internationally. After the United States Senate Watergate Committee in 1973 uncovered domestic surveillance abuses directed by the Executive branch of the United States government and &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1974 published an article by Seymour Hersh claiming the CIA had violated its charter by spying on anti-war activists, former CIA officials and some lawmakers called for a congressional inquiry that became known as the Church Committee. Published in 1976, the committee&#x27;s report confirmed some earlier stories that charged that the CIA had cultivated relationships with private institutions, including the press. Without identifying individuals by name, the Church Committee stated that it found fifty journalists who had official, but secret, relationships with the CIA. In a 1977 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine article, &quot;The CIA and the Media,&quot; reporter Carl Bernstein expanded upon the Church Committee&#x27;s report and wrote that more than 400 US press members had secretly carried out assignments for the CIA, including &quot;New York Times&quot; publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger, columnist and political analyst Stewart Alsop and &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Bernstein documented the way in which overseas branches of major US news agencies had for many years served as the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of Operation Mockingbird, which functioned to disseminate CIA propaganda through domestic US media. 

In &quot;Katharine the Great&quot;, Deborah Davis&#x27; 1979 unauthorized biography of Katharine Graham, owner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the author states that the CIA ran an &quot;Operation Mockingbird&quot; during this time, writing that the Prague-based International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) &quot;received money from Moscow and controlled reporters on every major newspaper in Europe, disseminating stories that promoted the Communist cause&quot;, and that Frank Wisner, director of the Office of Policy Coordination (a covert operations unit created in 1948 by the United States National Security Council) had created Operation Mockingbird in response to the IOJ, recruiting Phil Graham from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to run the project within the industry. According to Davis, &quot;By the early 1950s, Wisner &#x27;owned&#x27; respected members of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;Newsweek,&quot; CBS and other communications vehicles.&quot; Davis wrote that after Cord Meyer joined the CIA in 1951, he became Operation Mockingbird&#x27;s &quot;principal operative.&quot;

In &quot;The Rising Clamor: The American Press, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Cold War&quot;, David P. Hadley wrote that the &quot;continued lack of specific details [provided by the Church Committee and Bernstein&#x27;s exposé] proved a breeding ground for some outlandish claims regarding CIA and the press&quot;. He mentioned that Davis provided no information on her sources for her 1979 biography of Katharine Graham and that the Church Committee and other investigations that followed it did not reveal an operation as described by Davis. According to Hadley, &quot;Mockingbird, as described by Davis, has remained a stubbornly persistent theory&quot;; and added, &quot;The Davis/Mockingbird theory, that the CIA operated a deliberate and systematic program of widespread manipulation of the U.S. media, does not appear to be grounded in reality, but that should not disguise the active role the CIA played in influencing the domestic press&#x27;s output.&quot;

<doc id="584351" wikidata="Q767394" url="?curid=584351" title="United States congressional delegations from Connecticut">
<text>Since Connecticut became a U.S. state in 1788, it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives, beginning with the 1st United States Congress in 1789. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years in general elections, with their re-election staggered. Prior to the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were elected by the Connecticut General Assembly. Each state elects varying numbers of members of the House, depending on population, to two-year terms. Connecticut has sent five members to the House in each congressional delegation since the 2000 United States Census.

A total of 292 unique individuals have represented Connecticut in Congress; Connecticut has had 57 senators and 259 representatives, and 24 have served in both the House and the Senate. Nine women from Connecticut have served in the House, the first being Clare Booth Luce, while none have served in the Senate. Two African-Americans from Connecticut, Gary Franks and Jahana Hayes, have served in the House.

The current dean, or longest serving member, of the Connecticut delegation is Representative Rosa DeLauro of the , who has served in the House since 1991. She is the longest-serving House member in Connecticut history, and the second longest-serving member of Congress from Connecticut, behind Chris Dodd, who served 36 years combined in the House and Senate. Dodd is also Connecticut&#x27;s longest-serving senator.

== Current delegation ==

Connecticut&#x27;s current congressional delegation in the consists of its two senators and its five representatives, all of whom are Democrats. Connecticut has not had a Republican member of Congress for more than a decade, since Republican representative Chris Shays lost his race against Democrat Jim Himes in the state&#x27;s 4th congressional district in 2008.

The current dean, or longest serving member, of the Connecticut delegation is Representative Rosa DeLauro of the , who has served in the House since 1991. She is the longest-serving House member in Connecticut history, and the second longest-serving member of Congress from Connecticut, behind Chris Dodd, who served 36 years in total.

As of August 2023, the Cook Partisan Voting Index, a determination of how strongly partisan a state is, ranked all districts and senate races in Connecticut as solidly Democratic, except for the 5th House district, currently represented by Jahana Hayes, which was ranked as leaning Republican.
== United States Senate ==
Senators Oliver Ellsworth, William S. Johnson, and Roger Sherman were Founding Fathers. Ellsworth helped write the Judiciary Act of 1789, and later served as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Uriah Tracy served as president pro tempore of the Senate from May 1800 to November 1800, James Hillhouse served as president pro tempore from February 1801 to December 1801, Lafayette Sabine Foster served as president pro tempore from March 1865 to March 1867, and Frank Brandegee served as president pro tempore from May 1912 to March 1913. Senator Orville Platt, along with Nelson Aldrich, William Allison, and John Coit Spooner, formed &quot;The Senate Four&quot;, a group of powerful legislators who controlled much of the Senate&#x27;s operations. Platt also helped draft the Platt Amendment. Senator Joseph Lieberman was the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000.

Senators are elected every six years depending on their class, with each senator serving a six-year term, and elections for senators occurring every two years, rotating through each class such that each election, around one-third of the seats in the Senate are up for election. Connecticut&#x27;s senators are elected in classes I and III. Currently, Connecticut is represented in the Senate by Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy.







== United States House of Representatives ==
John Q. Tilson served as the House Majority Leader for the Republican party from 1925 to 1931. Barbara Kennelly was the first woman to become the Democratic chief deputy whip. Ella T. Grasso later became the first female governor elected in the United States.

From 1789 to 1837, representatives from Connecticut were elected from Connecticut&#x27;s at-large congressional district, which was subsequently replaced with Connecticut&#x27;s congressional districts. Connecticut has sent five members to the House in each congressional delegation since the 2000 United States Census. One member of the House of Representatives is sent from each district via a popular vote. Districts are redrawn every ten years, after data from the US Census is collected.

<doc id="584352" wikidata="Q15527505" url="?curid=584352" title="Tinsagu nu Hana">
<text>, also , is an Okinawan song about traditional Ryukyuan values such as filial piety and other Confucian teachings in the Okinawan language.

==Description==

The title of the song can be translated as &quot;The Balsam Flowers&quot;. The song is an Okinawan children&#x27;s song; Okinawan children would squeeze the sap from balsam flowers to stain their fingernails as a way to ward off evil. The lyrics of the song are Confucian teachings. Of the first six verses, the first three relate to filial piety, while the latter three refer to respecting one&#x27;s body and one&#x27;s goals. Each verse has exactly the same number of notes using language and meter devices that are uniquely Okinawan, called Ryūka.

The Okinawa Prefectural government designated &quot;Tinsagu nu Hana&quot; as &quot;Okinawa Prefecture&#x27;s favorite song&quot; on March 18, 2012, following a public survey. It was subsequently made an official symbol of Okinawa Prefecture, making it the prefecture&#x27;s second musical symbol alongside the &quot;Song of Okinawa Prefecture&quot;.

<doc id="584354" wikidata="Q1325701" url="?curid=584354" title="Treatment Action Campaign">
<text>The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) is a South African HIV/AIDS activist organisation which was co-founded by the HIV-positive activist Zackie Achmat in 1998. TAC is rooted in the experiences, direct action tactics and anti-apartheid background of its founder. TAC has been credited with forcing the reluctant government of former South African President Thabo Mbeki to begin making antiretroviral drugs available to South Africans.

==Founding==
The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) was launched on 10 December 1998, International Human Rights Day. Zackie Achmat, whom &quot;The New Yorker&quot; calls &quot;the most important dissident in the country since Nelson Mandela&quot;, joined with a group of ten other activists to found the group after anti-apartheid gay rights activist Simon Nkoli died from AIDS even as highly active antiretroviral therapy was available to wealthy South Africans. Shortly thereafter, prompted by the murder of HIV-positive activist Gugu Dlamini, HIV-positive and HIV-negative members of the new group began wearing the group&#x27;s now-famous T-shirts with the words &quot;HIV Positive&quot; printed boldly in front, a strategy inspired by the apocryphal story of the Danish king wearing the yellow star marking Jews under Nazi occupation. Achmat also became famous for his pledge to not take antiretroviral medicines until all South Africans could obtain them.

Quickly outgrowing its start among a small group of Cape Town activists, a number of whom had political roots in the Marxist Workers Tendency of the ANC, TAC became a much more broadly based group, with chapters in many regions of the nation and a largely black and poor constituency. The group campaigns for greater access to HIV treatment for all South Africans by raising public awareness and understanding about issues surrounding the availability, affordability and use of HIV treatments.

The Treatment Action Campaign produces Equal Treatment, a magazine dedicated to HIV and health issues.

==Suing the government==
The TAC first confronted the South African government for not ensuring that mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) prevention was available to pregnant mothers. It won this case on the basis of the South African constitutional guarantee of the right to health care, and the government was ordered to provide MTCT programs in public clinics. TAC also assisted the government by defending it in the case brought against the government by the pharmaceutical industry. TAC entered the case as an amicus curiae, submitting a brief in favour of the government&#x27;s position. Although the withdrawal of the pharmaceutical companies from this case resulted in a government victory, the government showed no interest in providing access to the generic antiretroviral medications that its victory allowed.

Indeed, far from embracing their common victory against the patent rights of multinational companies who were not making affordable drugs available, President Thabo Mbeki began promoting the AIDS denialist view that HIV might not cause AIDS, and that AIDS medications were more toxic than helpful, inviting foreign AIDS denialists to advise his government.

==Campaign for access to antiretrovirals==
According to TAC&#x27;s founder, two million South Africans died prematurely of AIDS during the term of former President Mbeki, and many of these deaths could have been prevented by timely implementation of access to anti-HIV drugs.

Following their legal victories, and facing continuing refusal by the government to make antiretrovirals available, TAC began a campaign for universal access to AIDS treatment through the public health system. In a national congress in 2002, the group decided to confront the government on this issue, first enacting a thousands-strong march on Parliament in February 2003, and then beginning a civil disobedience campaign in March 2003. After assurances from people within the government that a treatment plan would be forthcoming, TAC suspended its civil disobedience campaign.

In the summer of 2003, TAC obtained and leaked an internally circulated government report showing that treatment would be cost-effective by reducing costly hospitalisations within the public-sector health system; however, the government did not endorse the report and condemned the leak. In August 2003, at its next annual congress, TAC voted to resume civil disobedience. TAC members also voted to recommend that Achmat take his medications, which he agreed he would do. At the same time, TAC began a Treatment Project to distribute medications to its activists and to other community members.

Shortly after the Congress, and before the civil disobedience campaign resumed, the Cabinet voted to begin roll-out of antiretroviral access through public-sector health clinics. In the South African system, the Cabinet can overrule the President, and it appeared to have done so in this case.

Although the Cabinet voted to reaffirm that South African AIDS policy is based on the evidence that HIV causes AIDS, former President Thabo Mbeki continued to support the AIDS denialist position, as did his Minister of Health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang. The Minister of Health put special emphasis on nutrition as an alternative to antiretroviral treatment. As the top health official of South Africa, she was a particular target of TAC activism. Tshabalala-Msimang was removed as Health Minister in September 2008 after President Mbeki left office, a move hailed by the Treatment Action Campaign.

Although antiretroviral access is now official policy, its implementation has been spotty. TAC continues to protest and sue the government (working with the AIDS Law Project) in order to continue to influence the speed of and approach to the rollout.

== 2006 IAS Conference and the Global Day of Action ==

At the XVI International AIDS Society Conference in Toronto, 13–18 August 2006, TAC had a significant presence. Many TAC staff presented in seminars and chaired sessions, most prominently TAC Secretary Sipho Mthathi and Treasurer Mark Heywood. Heywood was a panelist in a plenary session co-chaired by CNN&#x27;s Sanjay Gupta entitled &quot;Time to Deliver: The Price of Inaction&quot;. Towards the end of the session, supporters of TAC, many of whom were wearing the distinctive &quot;HIV POSITIVE&quot; T-shirts, took to the stage behind the panel and silently held placards containing messages such as &quot;Fire Manto&quot;, in reference to the Health Minister, who was in attendance.

TAC members and supporters also took over the South African government&#x27;s booth in the exhibitor&#x27;s area. The booth contained bowls of lemons and garlic, which the Health Minister has claimed contribute to fighting HIV. TAC members passed around these items mockingly, and toyi-toyied inside the booth, attracting attention to the South African government&#x27;s expenditure on the elaborate booth and lack of corresponding commitment to the national treatment plan.

During the conference&#x27;s closing ceremonies, United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa Stephen Lewis pointed out the failure of South Africa&#x27;s response to HIV/AIDS, calling their actions more &quot;[more] worthy of a lunatic fringe than of a concerned and compassionate state.&quot; He also announced that earlier in the morning, Zackie Achmat and 44 others had been arrested for occupying provincial offices in Cape Town in protest of government&#x27;s failure to treat prisoners with anti-retrovirals, and in particular the recent death of one plaintiff in the legal case against the government on this matter.

After the conclusion of the conference, TAC declared a Global Day of Action for Thursday, 24 August 2006. Protests and marches were held in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and China by TAC supporters and sympathisers. In South Africa, police used pepper spray on protesters at the Department of Correctional Services building in central Cape Town, though no one was seriously hurt. Similar protests in Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Limpopo, and KwaZulu-Natal were not met with violence. Over 2000 people took part in the demonstrations. The TAC&#x27;s objective was to deliver its five demands, which include the convening of a national meeting and plan for the HIV/AIDS crisis, the dismissal of the Health Minister, the immediate treatment of prisoners, respect for the rule of law and the Constitution, and the building of a people&#x27;s health service.

== Support ==

The TAC has received support from many sectors of South African society, including Supreme Court Justice Edwin Cameron, former President Nelson Mandela, Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Njongonkulu Ndungane, Médecins Sans Frontières, and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). In August 2006, U.S. President Barack Obama, then a Senator, visited TAC&#x27;s Khayelitsha office and met with then TAC chairperson Zackie Achmat. During his visit, Obama emphasised the importance of HIV testing and urged the South African government to &quot;awake&quot; from AIDS denialism.

TAC is supported by , a nonprofit organisation that promotes social entrepreneurship.

==Solidarity==
TAC has worked with and shown solidarity with a number of organisations and movements. This includes the Social Justice Coalition, the Anti-Eviction Campaign, the AIDS Law Project and COSATU. In October 2009, TAC issued a statement of Solidarity with Abahlali baseMjondolo condemning the attacks by ANC members on Kennedy Road informal settlement.

<text>The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, or Ballard Locks, is a complex of locks at the west end of Salmon Bay in Seattle, Washington&#x27;s Lake Washington Ship Canal, between the neighborhoods of Ballard to the north and Magnolia to the south.

The Ballard Locks carry more boat traffic than any other lock in the U.S., and the locks, along with the fish ladder and the surrounding Carl S. English Jr. Botanical Gardens, attract more than one million visitors annually, making it one of Seattle&#x27;s top tourist attractions. The construction of the locks profoundly reshaped the topography of Seattle and the surrounding area, lowering the water level of Lake Washington and Lake Union by , adding miles of new waterfront land, reversing the flow of rivers, and leaving piers in the eastern half of Salmon Bay high and dry. The Locks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and have been designated by the American Society of Civil Engineers as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

==Prior to construction==
As early as 1854, there was discussion of building a navigable connection between Lake Washington and Puget Sound for the purpose of transporting logs, milled lumber, and fishing vessels. Thirteen years later, the United States Navy endorsed a canal project, which included a plan for building a naval shipyard on Lake Washington. In 1891 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers started planning the project. Some preliminary work was begun in 1906, and work began in earnest five years later under the command of Hiram M. Chittenden. The delays in canal planning and construction resulted in the US Navy building the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, which is located across the Sound from Seattle.

==Construction==
In early 1909, the Washington State Legislature appropriated $250,000, placed under the control of the Corps of Engineers, for excavation of the canal between Lake Union and Lake Washington. In June 1910, the US Congress gave its approval for the lock, on the condition that the rest of the canals along the route be paid for locally. Construction was then delayed by legal challenges, mainly by mill owners in Ballard who feared property damage and loss of waterfront in Salmon Bay, and by Lake Washington property owners.

Under Major James. B. Cavanaugh, Chittenden&#x27;s replacement as Seattle District Commander, construction of the Ballard, or Government, Locks connecting Salmon Bay to Shilshole Bay began in 1911, proceeding without further controversy or legal entanglements. In July 1912, the Locks gates were closed for the first time, turning Salmon Bay from saltwater to freshwater. The first ship passed through the locks on August 3, 1916. On August 25, 1916, the temporary dam at Montlake was breached. During the following three months, Lake Washington drained, lowering the water level by and drying up more than of wetlands, as well as drying up the Black River and cutting off the Cedar River salmon run.

The Cedar River was rerouted into Lake Washington to provide sufficient water flow for operating the Locks. Additionally the White River was rerouted into the Puyallup River. The Cedar and White Rivers both originally flowed into the Duwamish causing frequent flooding. The rerouting of the rivers opened up huge lowland areas for development but significantly disrupted the Duwamish salmon runs. To rectify this problem, salmon runs were reintroduced allowing the fish to migrate through the locks. The locks officially opened for boat traffic on May 8, 1917. The total cost of the project to that point was $3.5 million, with $2.5 million having come from the federal government and the rest from local governments.

To allow for the intended boat traffic, three bridges were removed along the ship canal route, at Latona Avenue, Fremont, Stone Way. The Ballard and Fremont Bridges were completed in 1917, followed by the University Bridge in 1919, and Montlake Bridge in 1925. The University Bridge was improved in 1932, and in 1934 the Lake Washington Ship Canal project was declared complete.

While generally a success, the project was not without its problems. Salt water began to make its way upstream toward Lake Union, requiring a system of siphons and flushing mechanisms. Because the Cedar River was the main water source both for the lakes and locks and for Seattle&#x27;s potable water, at times there were problems maintaining an adequate water supply to maintain lake level and operate the locks. Conversely, with several rivers redirected, flooding worsened throughout the watershed. That last problem was exacerbated by logging, and at times during storms the locks had to be opened just to allow water to flow out.

==Function==

The locks and associated facilities serve three purposes:
* To maintain the water level of the fresh water Lake Washington and Lake Union at above sea level, or more specifically, above Puget Sound&#x27;s mean low tide.
* To prevent the mixing of sea water from Puget Sound with the fresh water of the lakes (saltwater intrusion).
* To move boats from the water level of the lakes to the water level of Puget Sound, and vice versa.

The complex includes two locks, (small) and (large). The complex also includes a spillway with six gates to assist in water-level control. A fish ladder is integrated into the locks for migration of anadromous fish, notably salmon.

The grounds feature a visitors center, as well as the Carl S. English Jr. Botanical Gardens.

Operated by the US Army Corps of Engineers, the locks were formally opened on July 4, 1917, although the first ship passed on August 3, 1916. They were named after US Army Major Hiram M. Chittenden, the Seattle District Engineer for the Corps of Engineers from April 1906 to September 1908. They were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Vessels passing from the freshwater Lakes Washington and Union to Puget Sound enter the lock chamber through the open upper gates (A in the accompanying diagram). The lower gates (B) and the draining valve (D) are closed. The vessel is assisted by the lockwall attendants who assure it is tied down and ready for the chamber to be drained.

Next, the upper gates (A) and the filling valve (C) are closed and the draining valve (D) is opened allowing water to drain via gravity out to Puget Sound.

When the water pressure is equal on both sides of the gate, the lower gates (B) are opened, allowing the vessels to leave the lock chamber.

The process is reversed for upstream locking.
==Locks==

The complex includes two locks. Using the small lock when boat traffic is low conserves fresh water during summer, when the lakes receive less inflow. Having two locks also allows one of the locks to be drained for maintenance without blocking all boat traffic. The large lock is drained for approximately 2-weeks, usually in November, and the small lock is drained for about the same period, usually in March.

The locks can elevate a vessel , from the level of Puget Sound at a very low tide to the level of freshwater Salmon Bay, in 10–15 minutes. The locks handle both pleasure boats and commercial vessels, ranging from kayaks to fishing boats returning from the Bering Sea to cargo ships. Over 1 million tons of cargo, fuel, building materials, and seafood products pass through the locks each year.

==Spillway==

South of the small lock is a spillway dam with tainter gates used to regulate the freshwater levels of the ship canal and lakes. The gates on the dam release or store water to maintain the lake within a range of above sea level. Maintaining this lake level is necessary for floating bridges, mooring facilities, and vessel clearances under bridges.

&quot;Smolt flumes&quot; in the spillway help young salmon to pass safely downstream. Higher water levels are maintained in the summer to accommodate recreation as well as to allow the lakes to act as a water storage basin in anticipation of drought conditions.

==Salt water barrier==

If excessive salt water were allowed to migrate into Salmon Bay, the salt could eventually damage the freshwater ecosystem. To prevent this, a basin was dredged just above (east of) the large lock. The heavier salt water settles into the basin and drains through a pipe discharging downstream of the locks area. In 1975, the saltwater drain was modified to divert some salt water from the basin to the fish ladder, where it is added via a diffuser to the fish ladder attraction water; see below.

To further restrict saltwater intrusion, in 1966, a hinged barrier was installed just upstream of the large lock. This hollow metal barrier is filled with air to remain in the upright position, blocking the heavier salt water. When necessary to accommodate deep-draft vessels, the barrier is flooded and sinks to the bottom of the chamber.

==Fish ladder==
The fish ladder at the Chittenden locks is unusual—materials published by the federal government say &quot;unique&quot;—in being located where salt and fresh water meet. Normally, fish ladders are located entirely within fresh water.

Pacific salmon are &quot;anadromous&quot;; they hatch in lakes, rivers, and streams—or, nowadays fish hatcheries—migrate to sea, and only at the end of their life return to fresh water to spawn. Prior to the Locks construction, no significant salmon runs existed here, as there was only a small drainage stream from Lake Union into Salmon Bay. In order to provide enough water to operate the Locks, Cedar River was rerouted into Lake Washington (which was lowered 9 feet). Cedar River originally flowed into the Duwamish River along with the White River from the South. White River was rerouted into the Puyallup River. Cedar and White Rivers did support significant Salmon runs but also created severe flooding conditions for the early settlers. The rerouting of these two major rivers was a mixed blessing, while reducing flood threats, the Duwamish River salmon runs were decimated. To rectify this situation, salmon runs were rerouted through the Locks, which included introducing a major run of Sockeye Salmon using stock from Baker River, Washington.

The ladder was designed to use attraction water: fresh water flowing swiftly out the bottom of the fish ladder, in the direction opposite which anadromous fish migrate at the end of their lives. However, the attraction water from this first ladder was not effective. Instead, most salmon used the locks. This made them an easy target for predators like Herschel the sea lion; also, many were injured by hitting the walls and gates of the locks, or by hitting boat propellers.

The Corps rebuilt the fish ladder in 1976 by increasing the flow of attraction water and adding more weirs: most weirs are now one foot higher than the previous one. The old fish ladder had only 10 &quot;steps&quot;; the new one has 21. A diffuser well mixes salt water gradually into the last 10 weirs. As a part of the rebuilding, the Corps also added an underground chamber with a viewing gallery.The fish approaching the ladder smell the attraction water, recognizing the scent of Lake Washington and its tributaries. They enter the ladder, and either jump over each of the 21 weirs or swim though tunnel-like openings. They exit the ladder into the fresh water of Salmon Bay. They continue following the waterway to the lake, river, or stream where they were born. Once there, the females lay eggs, which the males fertilize. Most salmon die shortly after spawning.

The offspring remain in the fresh water until they are ready to migrate to the ocean as smolts. In a few years, the surviving adults return, climb the fish ladder, and reach their spawning ground to continue the life cycle. Of the millions of young fish born, only a relative few survive to adulthood. Causes of death include natural predators, commercial and sport fishing, disease, low stream flows, poor water quality, flooding, and concentrated developments along streams and lakes.

Visitors to the locks can observe the salmon through windows as they progress along their route. Although the viewing area is open year-round, the &quot;peak&quot; viewing time is during spawning season, from about the beginning of July through mid-August. A public art work, commissioned by the Seattle Arts Commission, provides literary interpretation of the experience through recordings of Seattle poet Judith Roche&#x27;s &quot;Salmon Suite,&quot; a sequence of five poems tied to the annual migratory sequence of the fish.


===Migratory fish===
Among the species of salmonids migrating routinely through the ladder at the Chittenden Locks are Chinook (king) salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;), Coho (silver) salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;), Sockeye (red) salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot;). Sockeye primarily migrate up the Cedar River to spawn and most end up at the Landsberg Dam Hatchery. Chinook and Coho migrate up the Issaquah Creek and most end up at the Issaquah Hatchery.

Steelhead (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;), once migrated through the Locks but none have been seen in years. The run is considered functionally extinct.

It has its roots in the larger musical traditions of the Southern Islands.

A dichotomy widely accepted by Okinawan people is the separation of musical traditions into &quot;koten&quot; (classical) and &quot;min&#x27;yō&quot; (folk). Okinawa was once ruled by the highly centralized kingdom of Ryūkyū. The samurai class in the capital of Shuri developed its high culture while they frequently suppressed folk culture in rural areas. Musicologist Susumu Kumada added another category, &quot;popular music&quot;, to describe songs that emerged after the kingdom was abolished in 1879.

===Classical music===

 was the court music of Ryūkyū. was the traditional chamber music of the royal palace at Shuri Castle. It was performed by the bureaucrats as official duties.

The texture is essentially heterophonic using a single melodic line. Pitched accompaniment instruments each play a simultaneous variation on the vocal line.

===Folk music===
Traditionally seen as &quot;low culture&quot; by the samurai class, folk music gained positive evaluation with the rise of folkloristics led by Yanagita Kunio. Folk music is described by the Japanese term &quot;min&#x27;yō&quot;. Since the kingdom was abolished, some members of the former samurai class spread Shuri-based high culture to other areas of Okinawa. Some of such new elements are today seen as part of folk culture.

Okinawa&#x27;s folk songs are generally accompanied by one (or more) sanshin.

The suffixes &quot;-ondo&quot; and &quot;-bushi&quot; (both meaning &quot;song&quot; or &quot;melody&quot;) may also be attached to the title of folk songs, however songs named without these clarifiers are more common. Eisā and kachāshī are Okinawan dances with specific music styles that accompany them.

;Warabi uta
 is a general term for nursery rhymes and children&#x27;s songs.

===Popular music===
====New folk songs====
, composed in the style of traditional Okinawan min&#x27;yō, have been written by several contemporary Okinawan folk musicians such as Rinshō Kadekaru, Sadao China, Shoukichi Kina, Seijin Noborikawa, and Tsuneo Fukuhara. These songs are often heard in contemporary pop music arrangements. , with music and lyrics by Shōkichi Kina, is typical of this genre.

Okinawa&#x27;s (new) folk songs are sometimes referred to as &quot;shima-uta&quot;. The term is not native to Okinawa but was borrowed from its northern neighbor, the Amami Islands, in the 1970s. The application of the term to Okinawan music is disfavored by people who see &quot;shima-uta&quot; as a regional brand of the Amami Islands.

====Okinawa pop====
The music of Okinawa came under the influence of American rock music beginning with the end of World War II. Many musicians began to blend the Okinawan folk music style and native instruments with those of American popular and rock music. This is called &quot;Uchinaa pop&quot;. One example is Ryukyu Underground, who combine both classical and folk music with modern Dub music.

==Instrumentation==
The instrument that defines Okinawan music is the sanshin (shamisen). It is a three-stringed lute, very similar to the Chinese sanxian and a precursor to the Japanese shamisen. The body is covered in snake skin and it is plucked with a plectrum worn on the index finger.

Okinawan folk music is often accompanied by various taiko drums such as , , and . Pārankū, a small hand-held drum about the size of a tambourine, is often used in eisā dancing.

Other percussion instruments such as , and can often be heard in Okinawan music. &quot;Sanba&quot; are three small, flat pieces of wood or plastic that are used to make rapid clicking sounds, similar to castanets. &quot;Yotsutake&quot; are two sets of rectangular bamboo strips tied together, one set held in each hand, clapped together on the strong beat of the music. Traditionally they have been used in classical music, but recently they have been used in eisā dancing.

A group of singers called a often accompanies folk music, singing the chorus or interjecting shouts called . Also finger whistling called is common in kachāshī and eisā dance tunes.

Additional instruments are often used in classical music, and sometimes incorporated in folk music: 
* – an Okinawan version of the koto; often called or 
* – an Okinawan version of the kokyū
* – an Okinawan transverse flute; also called &quot;fansō&quot; (ファンソー) or 

==Tonality==
&quot;The following is described in terms used in Western disciplines of music.&quot;

Music from Okinawa uses tonal structure that is different in music from mainland Japan and Amami in particular the intervalic content of the scales used.

The chief pentatonic scale used in mainland Japan, for example, uses scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, also known as Do, Re, Mi, So, and La in the Kodály system of solfeggio. This structure avoids half step intervals by eliminating the fourth and seventh scale degrees.

In contrast, music from Okinawa is abundant in the half steps. Common structures used in Okinawan music are a pentatonic scale utilizing scale degrees 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, or Do, Mi, Fa, So, Ti, or a hexatonic scale with the addition of the second scale degree, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, Ti. Half steps occur between the third and fourth (Mi and Fa), and also the seventh and first (Ti and Do) scale degrees. In particular, the interval from 7 to 1, or Ti to Do is very common. A folk tune can often be recognized as being Okinawan by noting the presence of this interval.

<doc id="584368" wikidata="Q3290402" url="?curid=584368" title="Patrick Bouvier Kennedy">
<text>Patrick Bouvier Kennedy (August 7–9, 1963) was the youngest child of United States President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. His elder siblings were Caroline, John Jr., and Arabella.

Born prematurely, Kennedy lived for just 39 hours and 12 minutes before dying from complications of hyaline membrane disease (HMD), after desperate attempts to save him failed. His infant death left the first family and nation in mourning. However it also brought HMD now known as infantile respiratory distress syndrome into the public consciousness, inspiring further research.

==Background==
In August 1963, the 34-year-old Jacqueline Kennedy was in her third year as first lady and in the third trimester of her fifth pregnancy. She had suffered a miscarriage in 1955, followed the next year by a stillborn baby girl that the Kennedys planned to name Arabella after a ship with that name. Two healthy children followed: Caroline in 1957 and John Jr. in 1960. As John had also been premature, she asked her obstetrician, John W. Walsh, to accompany her when she and her children spent the summer in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. The nearby Otis Air Force Base Hospital had also prepared a suite for her in case it was necessary.

On the morning of Wednesday, August 7, Jackie took Caroline and John Jr. for a pony ride in Osterville, Massachusetts. While the children were riding, Kennedy felt labor pains. Walsh was summoned, and they were taken by helicopter to Otis Air Force Base.

President Kennedy was at the White House at the time. August 7 was the 20th anniversary of the day the United States Navy had rescued him in World War II after he had spent five days marooned on an island in the Pacific. Kennedy had been in command of Motor Torpedo Boat &quot;PT-109&quot; when it was rammed by a Japanese destroyer, killing two of his crew. His heroics had helped launch his political career. &quot;PT-109&quot; and August 7 were never far from his mind, and he kept a scale model of the boat on a shelf in the Oval Office and each day used a metal tie clasp shaped like a torpedo boat, with &quot;PT 109&quot; stamped across its bow.

==Birth and treatment==
While his father was aboard Air Force One, the infant Kennedy was born by emergency caesarean section at 12:52 p.m. on August 7, 1963, at the Otis Air Force Base Hospital in Bourne, Massachusetts, five and a half weeks prematurely. The caesarean section was performed by Dr. John W. Walsh, who had also delivered Mrs. Kennedy&#x27;s son John Jr. in 1960. The infant&#x27;s birth weight was . He was the first child born to a serving U.S. president and first lady since the 19th century.

Shortly after birth, Kennedy developed symptoms of hyaline membrane disease (HMD), now called infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS). It was detected by breathing difficulties within minutes. The president arrived, saw his son in distress, and sent for a chaplain. The infant was quickly baptized, named Patrick after his great-grandfather Patrick Joseph Kennedy (1858–1929). He was given the middle name of Bouvier after his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

The president was allowed to wheel the baby in an incubator to the First Lady&#x27;s bedside. James E. Drorbaught, the pediatric specialist at Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, was flown by helicopter from Boston to consult on his case, and he recommended transfer to Boston. Five hours after birth, the infant, accompanied by Dr. Drorbaught, was rushed by ambulance to Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, away, in under 90 minutes. The transfer to the hospital in Boston was initially reported as a &quot;precautionary measure,&quot; the White House said. The baby&#x27;s condition was accurately reported as HMD, but it was also reported that it would take at least four days to assess his condition and that he was being given medication to assist his condition.

At the time, all that could be done for a baby with hyaline membrane disease was to keep the patient&#x27;s blood chemistry as close to normal as possible. Led by Dr. Drorbaught, who stayed awake the entire time, the hospital tried everything possible to save the infant&#x27;s life. The baby was given hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in which he was placed in a hyperbaric chamber filled with 100% oxygen and pressurized to greater than one atmosphere. At the time, the treatment was revolutionary; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;one of the newest interests of medical researchers.&quot;

==Death and funeral==
Kennedy died at 4:04 a.m. on August 9 &quot;despite a desperate medical effort to save him&quot; and had lived for 39 hours and 12 minutes. At the time of the infant&#x27;s death, the president was outside the room with the hyperbaric chamber with his brother, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The first lady, then 34, remained at Otis Air Force Base Hospital recovering from the caesarean section. She was told of her son&#x27;s death by Dr. Walsh. (He would console her again after her husband&#x27;s assassination and was aboard Air Force One with her as she returned from Dallas with the president&#x27;s body.) She was given a sedative and slept until the president flew from Boston. Very little was said about the family&#x27;s reaction. White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger stated of the first lady&#x27;s condition: &quot;Given the circumstances, her condition is satisfactory.&quot; The president, who had reportedly slept only four hours since the birth, was photographed arriving at Otis Air Force Base looking &quot;grave and appearing tired.&quot;

A small funeral mass was held on August 10, 1963, in the private chapel of Cardinal Richard Cushing in Boston. The president&#x27;s mother, Rose Kennedy, was in Paris and was told not to return for the funeral, but the first lady&#x27;s sister Lee Radziwill had already flown in from Greece before the baby died.

Cushing, the Archbishop of Boston, performed the funeral mass, as he would for John F. Kennedy, assassinated 104 days later. Siblings Caroline, then five years old, and John Jr., two and a half, did not attend.

The child was initially buried at Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts, the president&#x27;s hometown. His body and that of his stillborn sister Arabella were reinterred on December 5, 1963, alongside their father, at Arlington National Cemetery and later moved to their permanent graves in Section 45, Grid U-35.

==Legacy==
Kennedy&#x27;s death made 1963 a &quot;pivotal year&quot; for neonatology, then still a relatively-new field, according to an examination of its history in the journal &quot;Neonatology&quot;. The increased public awareness of HMD led to a corresponding increase in research of the disease, spurring development of new medical ventilators, blood gas tests and newborn intensive-care practices in both the United States and Europe. The first trials of a potential treatment for HMD, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, were published within a few years but were not considered a clinical success. According to Dr. Suhas M. Nafday, director of Newborn Services at the Children&#x27;s Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, the child&#x27;s death &quot;energized the neonatal researchers into action to look for an effective management of respiratory distress syndrome.&quot; In a review of advances in clinical medicine, researcher Thor Hansen observed that the &quot;medical profession did not have the tools to help&quot; Kennedy, &quot;the newborn son of arguably the most powerful man in the world,&quot; but 50 years later, treatment of his condition would be considered routine, with survival expected.

The parents were deeply affected by the death of their child. Secret Service agent Clint Hill recalled the couple having &quot;a distinctly closer relationship&quot; that was visible after the child&#x27;s death. Press Secretary Pierre Salinger believed that the couple had been brought closer by the presidency but even more so by the child&#x27;s death.

<text>James Jesse Strang (March 21, 1813 – July 9, 1856) was an American religious leader, politician and self-proclaimed monarch. He served as a member of the Michigan House of Representatives from 1853 until his assassination.

In 1844, he said he had been appointed as the successor of Joseph Smith as leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), a faction of the Latter Day Saint movement. Strang testified that he had possession of a letter from Smith naming him as his successor, and furthermore reported that he had been ordained to the prophetic office by an angel. His followers believe his organization to be the sole legitimate continuation of the Church of Christ founded by Smith fourteen years before.

A major contender for leadership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints during the 1844 succession crisis after Smith&#x27;s death, Strang urged other prominent church leaders like Brigham Young and Sidney Rigdon to remain in their previous offices and to support his appointment by Smith. Young and the members of the Twelve Apostles loyal to him rejected Strang&#x27;s claims, as did Rigdon, who had been a counselor in the First Presidency to Smith. This divided the Latter Day Saint movement. During his 12 years tenure as Prophet, Seer and Revelator, Strang reigned for six years as the crowned &quot;king&quot; of an ecclesiastical monarchy that he established on Beaver Island in the US state of Michigan. Building an organization that eventually rivaled Young&#x27;s in Utah, Strang gained nearly 12,000 adherents at a time when Young was said to have about 50,000. After Strang was killed in 1856 most of his followers rallied under Joseph Smith III and joined the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS). The Strangite church has remained small in comparison to other branches of the Latter-Day Saint movement.

Similar to Joseph Smith, who was alleged by church opponent William Marks to have been crowned King in Nauvoo prior to his death, Strang taught that the chief prophetic office embodied an overtly &quot;royal&quot; attribute. Thus, its occupant was to be not only the spiritual leader of his people but their temporal king as well. He offered a sophisticated set of teachings that differed in many significant aspects from any other version of Mormonism, including that preached by Smith. Like Smith, Strang published translations of two purportedly ancient lost works: the Voree Record, deciphered from three metal plates reportedly unearthed in response to a vision; and the Book of the Law of the Lord, supposedly transcribed from the Plates of Laban mentioned in the Book of Mormon. These are accepted as scripture by his followers, and the Church of Jesus Christ in Christian Fellowship, but not by any other Latter Day Saint church. Although his long-term doctrinal influence on the Latter Day Saint movement was minimal, several early members of Strang&#x27;s organization helped to establish the RLDS Church (now known as the Community of Christ), which became (and remains) the second-largest Latter Day sect. While most of Strang&#x27;s followers eventually disavowed him due to his eventual advocacy of polygamy, a small but devout remnant carries on his teachings and organization today.

In addition to his ecclesiastical calling, Strang served one full term and part of a second as a member of the Michigan House of Representatives, assisting in the organization of Manitou County. He was also at various times an attorney, educator, temperance lecturer, newspaper editor, Baptist minister, correspondent for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, and amateur scientist. His survey of Beaver Island&#x27;s natural history was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1854, remaining the definitive work on that subject for nearly a century, while his career in the Michigan legislature was praised even by his enemies.

While Strang&#x27;s organization is formally known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the term &quot;Strangite&quot; is usually added to the title to avoid confusing them with other Latter Day Saint bodies carrying this or similar names. This follows a typical nineteenth-century usage where followers of Brigham Young were referred to as &quot;Brighamites,&quot; while those of Sidney Rigdon were called &quot;Rigdonites,&quot; followers of Joseph Smith III were called &quot;Josephites&quot;, and disciples of Strang became &quot;Strangites&quot;.

==Childhood, education and conversion to Mormonism==
James Jesse Strang was born March 21, 1813, in Scipio, Cayuga County, New York. He was the second of three children, and his parents had a good reputation in their community. Strang&#x27;s mother was very tender with him as a consequence of delicate health, yet she required him to render an account of all his actions and words while absent from her. In a brief autobiography he wrote in 1855, Strang reported that he had attended grade school until age twelve, but that &quot;the terms were usually short, the teachers inexperienced and ill qualified to teach, and my health such as to preclude attentive study or steady attendance.&quot; He estimated that his time in a classroom during those years totaled six months.

But none of this meant that Strang was illiterate or simple. Although his teachers &quot;not unfrequently turned me off with little or no attention, as though I was too stupid to learn and too dull to feel neglect,&quot; Strang recalled that he spent &quot;long weary days ... upon the floor, thinking, thinking, thinking ... my mind wandered over fields that old men shrink from, seeking rest and finding none till darkness gathered thick around and I burst into tears.&quot; He studied works by Thomas Paine and the Comte de Volney, whose book &quot;Les Ruines&quot; exerted a significant influence on the future prophet.

As a youth, Strang kept a rather profound personal diary, written partly in a secret code that was not deciphered until over one hundred years after it was authored. This journal contains Strang&#x27;s musings on a variety of topics, including a sense that he was called to be a significant world leader the likes of Caesar or Napoleon and his regret that by age nineteen, he had not yet become a general or member of the state legislature, which he saw as being essential by that point in his life to his quest to be someone of importance. However, Strang&#x27;s diary reveals a heartfelt desire to be of service to his fellow man, together with agonized frustration at not knowing how he might do so as a penniless, unknown youth from upstate New York.

At age twelve, Strang was baptized a Baptist. He did not wish to follow his father&#x27;s calling as a farmer, so he took up the study of law. Strang was admitted to the bar in New York at age 23 and later at other places where he resided. He became county Postmaster and edited a local newspaper, the &quot;Randolph Herald&quot;. Later, in the midst of his myriad duties on Beaver Island, he would find time to found and publish the &quot;Daily Northern Islander&quot;, the first newspaper in northern Michigan.

Strang, who once described himself as a &quot;cool philosopher&quot; and a freethinker, became a Baptist minister but left in February 1844 to join the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He quickly found favor with Joseph Smith, though they had known each other only a short time, and was baptized personally by him on February 25, 1844. On March 3 of that year he was ordained an Elder by Joseph&#x27;s brother Hyrum and sent forthwith at Smith&#x27;s request to Wisconsin, to establish a Mormon stake at Voree. Shortly after Strang&#x27;s departure, Joseph Smith was murdered by an anti-Mormon mob in Carthage, Illinois.

==Succession claim and notable early allies==

After Smith&#x27;s death, Strang claimed the right to lead the Latter Day Saints, but he was not the only claimant to Smith&#x27;s prophetic mantle. His most significant rivals were Brigham Young, president of Smith&#x27;s Twelve Apostles, and Sidney Rigdon, a member of Smith&#x27;s First Presidency. A power struggle ensued, during which Young quickly disposed of Rigdon in a Nauvoo debate. Young would reject offers to debate with Strang for the next three years before leading his followers to Utah while Rigdon led a smaller group to Pennsylvania. As a newcomer to the faith Strang did not possess the name recognition, or a more prominent calling like his rivals, so his prospects of assuming Smith&#x27;s prophetic mantle appeared shaky at first. But this did not dissuade him. Though the Quorum of Twelve quickly published a notice in the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; of Strang&#x27;s excommunication, Strang insisted that the laws of the church prevented excommunication without a trial. He equally asserted that the Twelve had no right to sit in judgment on him, as &quot;he&quot; was the lawful church president. He began to attract several Mormon luminaries to his side, including Smith&#x27;s brother William Smith (an Apostle in Smith&#x27;s church), Smith&#x27;s mother Lucy Mack Smith, and William Marks, president of the Nauvoo Stake.

Strang rested his claim to leadership on an ordination by an angel at the very moment Joseph Smith died (similar to the ordination of Smith), requirements that he claimed were set forth in the Doctrine and Covenants that the President had to be appointed by revelation and ordained by angels, and a &quot;Letter of Appointment&quot; from Smith, carrying a legitimate Nauvoo postmark. This letter was dated June 18, 1844, just nine days before Smith&#x27;s death. Smith and Strang were some 225 miles (362 km) apart at the time, Strang offered witnesses to affirm that he had made his announcement before news of Smith&#x27;s demise was publicly available. Strang&#x27;s letter is held today by Yale University. Every aspect of the letter has been disputed by opposing factions, including the postmark and the signature however the postmark is genuine and at least one firm (Tyrell and Doud) hired to analyse the document and compare it to Smith&#x27;s known letters concluded that it was likely to have been authored by Smith. They concluded &quot;A brief observation of these four documents indicates that the education and word usage was consistent with the theory that all four documents were authored by one individual.&quot;

There have been several conflicting claims about the authenticity of the letter. One disaffected member of Strang&#x27;s church said they received a confession from Strang&#x27;s law partner, C. P. Barnes, that he had fabricated the Letter of Appointment and the Voree Plates. Another member of the Brighamites stated years after Strang&#x27;s death to have forged the letter himself and mailed it to Strang as a prank. There are no reliable firsthand statements, however, by witnesses or insiders that question the validity of the letter.
Strang&#x27;s letter convinced several eminent Mormons of his claims, including Book of Mormon witnesses John and David Whitmer, Martin Harris, and Hiram Page. In addition, apostles John E. Page, William E. McLellin, and William Smith, together with Nauvoo Stake President William Marks, and Bishop George Miller, accepted Strang. Joseph Smith&#x27;s mother, Lucy Mack Smith, and three of his sisters accepted Strang&#x27;s claims. According to the &quot;Voree Herald&quot;, Strang&#x27;s newspaper, Lucy Smith wrote to one Reuben Hedlock: &quot;I am satisfied that Joseph appointed J.J. Strang. It is verily so.&quot; According to Joseph Smith&#x27;s brother William, all of his family (except for Hyrum and Samuel Smith&#x27;s widows), endorsed Strang.
Also championing Strang was John C. Bennett, a physician and libertine who had a tumultuous career as Joseph Smith&#x27;s Assistant President and mayor of Nauvoo. Invited by Strang to join him in Voree, Bennett was instrumental in establishing a so-called &quot;Halcyon Order of the Illuminati&quot; there, with Strang as its &quot;Imperial Primate.&quot; Eventually, as in Nauvoo, Bennett fell into disfavor with the church and Strang expelled him in 1847. His &quot;order&quot; fell by the wayside and has no role in Strangism today, though it did lead to conflict between Strang and some of his associates.

==From monogamist to polygamist==

About 12,000 Latter Day Saints ultimately accepted Strang&#x27;s claims. A second &quot;Stake of Zion&quot; was established on Beaver Island in Lake Michigan, where Strang moved his church headquarters in 1848. Strang&#x27;s church had a high turnover rate, with many of his initial adherents, including all of those listed above (with the exception of George Miller, who remained loyal to Strang until death), leaving the church before his demise. John E. Page departed in July 1849, accusing Strang of dictatorial tendencies and concurring with Bennett&#x27;s furtive &quot;Illuminati&quot; order. Martin Harris had broken with Strang by January 1847, after a failed mission to England. Hiram Page and the Whitmers also left around this time.

Many defections, however, were due to Strang&#x27;s seemingly abrupt &quot;about-face&quot; on the turbulent subject of polygamy. Vehemently opposed to the practice at first, Strang reversed course in 1849 and became one of its strongest advocates, marrying five wives (including his original spouse, Mary) and fathering fourteen children. Since many of his early disciples viewed him as a monogamous counterweight to Brigham Young&#x27;s polygamous version of Mormonism, Strang&#x27;s decision to embrace plural marriage proved costly both to him and his organization. Strang defended his new tenet by claiming that, far from enslaving or demeaning women, polygamy would &quot;liberate&quot; and &quot;elevate&quot; them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors which were deemed important by them. Rather than being forced to wed &quot;corrupt and degraded sires&quot; due to the scarcity of more suitable men, a woman could marry the man who she believed was most compatible to her, the best candidate to father her children and give her the finest possible life, even if he had multiple wives.

At the time of his death, all four of Strang&#x27;s current wives were pregnant, and he had four posthumous children.

Strang and his first wife Mary Perce separated in May 1851, though they remained legally married until Strang&#x27;s death. His second wife, Elvira Eliza Field disguised herself at first as &quot;Charlie J. Douglas,&quot; Strang&#x27;s purported nephew, before revealing her true identity in 1850. Ironically, decades after Strang&#x27;s death, Strang&#x27;s fourth wife, Sarah Adelia Wright, divorced her second husband, Dr. Wing, due to Wing&#x27;s interest in polygamy. Strang&#x27;s last wife was Phoebe Wright, cousin to Sarah.

Sarah Wright described Strang as &quot;a very mild-spoken, kind man to his family, although his word was law.&quot; She wrote that while each wife had her own bedroom, they shared meals and devotional time together with Strang and life in their household was &quot;as pleasant as possible.&quot; On the other hand, Strang and Phoebe Wright&#x27;s daughter, Eugenia, wrote in 1936 that after only eight months of marriage, her mother had &quot;begun to feel dissatisfied with polygamy, though she loved him [Strang] devotedly all her life.&quot;

==Theology==
===Publications===
Like Joseph Smith, James Strang reported numerous visions, unearthed and translated allegedly ancient metal plates using what he said was the Biblical Urim and Thummim, and claimed to have restored long-lost spiritual knowledge to humankind. Like Smith, he presented witnesses to authenticate the records he claimed to have received. Unlike Smith, however, Strang offered his plates to the public for examination. The non-Mormon Christopher Sholes—inventor of the typewriter and editor of a local newspaper—perused Strang&#x27;s &quot;Voree Plates&quot;, a minuscule brass chronicle Strang said he had been led to by a vision in 1845. Sholes offered no opinion on Strang&#x27;s find, but described the prophet as &quot;honest and earnest&quot; and opined that his followers ranked &quot;among the most honest and intelligent men in the neighborhood.&quot; Strang published his translation of these plates as the &quot;Voree Record,&quot; purporting to be the last testament of Rajah Manchou of Vorito, who had lived in the area centuries earlier and wished to leave a brief statement for posterity. The Voree Plates disappeared around 1900, and their current whereabouts are unknown.

Strang also claimed to have translated a portion of the &quot;Plates of Laban&quot; described in the Book of Mormon. This translation was published in 1851 as the Book of the Law of the Lord, said to be selected from the original Law given to Moses and mentioned in . Republished in 1856, expanded with inspired notes and commentary, this book served as the constitution for Strang&#x27;s spiritual kingdom on Beaver Island, and is still accepted as scripture by Strangites. One distinctive feature (besides its overtly monarchial tone) is its restoration of a &quot;missing&quot; commandment to the Decalogue: &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; Strang insisted that versions of the Decalogue found in Bibles used by other churches—including other Latter Day Saint churches—contain only &quot;nine&quot; commandments, not ten.

Strang received several other revelations, which while never formally added to his church&#x27;s Doctrine and Covenants, are nevertheless accepted as scripture by his followers. These concerned, among other things, Baptism for the Dead, the building of a temple in Voree, the standing of Sidney Rigdon, and an invitation for Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith, to take a position as Counselor in Strang&#x27;s First Presidency. &quot;Young Joseph&quot; never accepted this calling and refused to have anything to do with Strang&#x27;s organization. Strang also authored &quot;The Diamond&quot;, an attack on the claims of Sidney Rigdon and Brigham Young, and &quot;The Prophetic Controversy&quot;, ostensibly for Mrs. Martha Coray, co-author with Lucy Mack Smith of &quot;The History of Joseph Smith by His Mother&quot;. Coray, a partisan of Brigham Young&#x27;s, had challenged &quot;the vain usurper&quot; to provide convincing evidence of his claims, and Strang obliged in this open letter addressed to her. Coray&#x27;s reaction has not been preserved.

===Distinctive dogmas===

Some of Strang&#x27;s teachings differed substantially from those of other Latter Day Saint leaders, including Joseph Smith. For instance, Strang rejected the traditional Christian doctrines of the Trinity and the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ, together with the Mormon doctrine of the &quot;plurality of gods.&quot; A monotheist, he insisted that there was only one eternal God in all the universe, Father, and that &quot;progression to godhood&quot; (a doctrine allegedly taught by Joseph Smith toward the end of his life) was impossible. God had always been God, said Strang, and He was only one Person, not three persons, according to the doctrine of the traditional Christian Trinity. Jesus Christ was presented as the natural-born son of Mary and Joseph, who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind but he had to be born as an ordinary mortal from two human parents (rather than being the offspring of either the Father or the Holy Spirit) in order to fulfill his Messianic role. In essence, Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was &quot;adopted&quot; as God&#x27;s son at birth, and he was fully revealed to be such during the Transfiguration. After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his resurrection and ascension.

Furthermore, Strang denied the belief that God could do &quot;all&quot; things, and he insisted that some things were as impossible for Him as for us. Thus, he saw no essential conflict between science and religion, and while he never openly championed evolution, he did state that God&#x27;s ability to use His power was limited by the matter which He was working with and it was also limited by the eons of time which were required to &quot;organize&quot; and shape it. Strang spoke glowingly about a future generation of people who would &quot;make religion a science,&quot; to be &quot;studied by as exact rules as mathematicks.&quot; &quot;The mouth of the Seer will be opened,&quot; he prophesied, &quot;and the whole earth enlightened.&quot;

Musing at length on the nature of sin and evil, Strang wrote that of all of the things that God could give to man, He could never give him &quot;experience&quot;. Thus, if &quot;free agency&quot; was real, said Strang, humanity must be given the opportunity to fail and learn from its own mistakes. The ultimate goal for each human being was to willingly conform oneself to the &quot;revealed character&quot; of God in every respect, preferring to do good rather than preferring to do evil not out of fear of punishment and not out of any desire for rewards, but preferring to do good solely &quot;on account of the innate loveliness of undefiled goodness; of pure unalloyed holiness.&quot;

===Practices===

Strang strongly believed in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath, and he enjoined it in lieu of Sunday; the Strangite church continues to observe this tradition. He advocated baptism for the dead, and practiced it to a limited extent in Voree as well as on Beaver Island. He also introduced animal sacrifice–not as atonement for sin, but as a part of Strangite celebration rituals. Animal sacrifices and baptisms for the dead are not currently practiced by the Strangite organization, but belief in each is still required by it. Strang attempted to construct a temple in Voree, but he was prevented from completing its construction due to the poverty and lack of cooperation which existed among his followers. No &quot;endowment&quot; rituals which are comparable to those in the Utah LDS and the Cutlerite churches appear to have existed among his followers. Eternal marriage formed a part of Strang&#x27;s teaching, but he did not require it to be performed in a temple (as is the case in the LDS church). Thus, such marriages are still contracted in Strang&#x27;s church in the absence of any Strangite temple or any &quot;endowment&quot; ceremony. Alcohol, tobacco, coffee and tea were all prohibited, just as they were in many other Latter Day Saint denominations. Polygamy is no longer practiced by Strang&#x27;s followers, but belief in its correctness is still affirmed by them.

Strang allowed women to hold the Priesthood offices of Priest and Teacher, unique among all Latter Day Saint factions during his lifetime. He welcomed African Americans into his church, and he ordained at least two of them to its eldership. Strang also mandated the conservation of land and resources, requiring the building of parks and the retention of large forests in his kingdom. He wrote an eloquent refutation of the &quot;Solomon Spalding theory&quot; of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s authorship, and defended the ministry and teachings of Joseph Smith.

==Coronation and troubled reign on Beaver Island==
Strang claimed that he was required to occupy the office of king as it is described in the Book of the Law of the Lord. He insisted that this authority was incumbent upon all holders of the prophetic office from the beginning of time, in similar fashion to Smith, who was secretly crowned as &quot;king&quot; of the Kingdom of God before his murder. Strang was accordingly crowned in 1850 by his counselor and Prime Minister, George J. Adams. About 300 people witnessed his coronation, for which he wore a bright red flannel robe which was topped by a white collar with black speckles. His crown was made of tin, rather than gold, and it is described in one account as being &quot;a shiny metal ring with a cluster of glass stars in the front.&quot; Strang also sported a breastplate and carried a wooden scepter. His reign lasted six years, and the date of his coronation, July 8, is still mandated as one of the two most important dates in the Strangite church year (the other being April 6, the anniversary of the founding of Joseph Smith&#x27;s church).

Strang never claimed to be the king of Beaver Island itself, nor did he claim to be the king of any other geographical entity. Instead, he claimed to be king of his church, which he considered the true &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; which was prophesied in Scripture and destined to spread itself over all the earth. Nor did Strang ever say that his &quot;kingdom&quot; supplanted United States sovereignty over Beaver Island. However, since his sect was the main religious body on the isle, claiming the allegiance of most of its inhabitants, Strang often asserted his authority on Beaver, even over non-Strangites—a practice which ultimately caused him and his followers a great deal of grief. Furthermore, he and many of his disciples were accused of forcibly appropriating property and revenue on the island, a practice which earned him few friends among the non-Mormon &quot;gentiles.&quot;

On the other hand, Strang and his people lived in apprehension of what their non-member neighbors might do next. Some Strangites were beaten up while they were going to the post office in order to collect their mail, and some of their homes were robbed and even seized by &quot;gentiles&quot; while Strangite men were away. On July 4, 1850, a drunken mob of fishermen vowed to kill the &quot;Mormons&quot; or drive them out, only to be awed into submission when Strang fired a cannon (which he had secretly acquired) at them. Competition for business and jobs added to tensions on the island, as did the increasing Strangite monopoly on local government, made sure after Beaver and adjacent islands were first attached to Emmet County in 1853, then later organized into their own insular county of Manitou in 1855.

As a result of his coronation, along with lurid tales which were being spread by George Adams (who had been excommunicated by Strang a few months after the ceremony), Strang was accused of treason, counterfeiting, trespassing on government land, and theft, along with other crimes. He was brought to trial in Detroit, Michigan, after President Millard Fillmore ordered US District Attorney George Bates to investigate the rumors about Strang and his colony. Strang&#x27;s successful trial defense brought him considerable favorable press, which he used as leverage when he ran for, and won, a seat on the Michigan state legislature as a Democrat in 1853. Facing a determined effort to deny him this seat due to the hostility of his enemies, he was permitted to address the legislature in his defense, after which the Michigan House of Representatives voted twice (first unanimously, then a second time by a 49–11 margin) to allow &quot;King Strang&quot; to join them.

In the 1853 legislative session, Strang introduced ten bills, five of which passed. The &quot;Detroit Advertiser&quot;, on February 10, 1853, wrote of Strang: &quot;Mr. Strang&#x27;s course as a member of the present Legislature, has disarmed much of the prejudices which have previously surrounded him. Whatever may be said or thought of the peculiar sect of which he is the local head, I take pleasure in stating that throughout this session he has conducted himself with the degree of decorum and propriety which have been equaled by his industry, sagacity, good temper, apparent regard for the true interests of the people, and the obligations of his official oath.&quot; He was reelected in 1855, and did much to organize the upper portion of Michigan&#x27;s lower peninsula into counties and townships. Strang ardently fought the illegal practice of trading liquor to local Native American tribes due to the common practice of selling them diluted liquor mixed with various contaminants at a high price. This made him many enemies among those non-Strangite residents of Beaver and nearby Mackinac Island who profited mightily from this illicit trade.

==Assassination==

As with Joseph Smith before him, James Strang had problems with excommunicated or disaffected members who often became anti-Mormons and/or even conspired against him. One of the latter, Thomas Bedford, who had been flogged for engaging in adultery with another member&#x27;s wife, blamed Strang for the flogging and sought revenge. Another, Hezekiah D. McCulloch, had been excommunicated for drunkenness and other alleged misdeeds, after previously enjoying Strang&#x27;s favor and several high offices in local government. These men conspired against Strang along with the Mormons&#x27; enemies who were living in Mackinac, two of whom were Alexander Wentworth and Dr. J. Atkyn. Pistols were procured, and the four conspirators began several days of target practice while they finalized the details of their murderous plan.

Although Strang apparently knew that Bedford and the others were gunning for him, he openly challenged them in his newspaper, The Northern Islander, writing, &quot;We laugh with bitter scorn at all these threats,&quot; just days before his murder. Strang refused to employ a bodyguard or carry a firearm or any other type of weapon.
On Monday, June 16, 1856, Strang was waylaid around 7:00 PM on the dock at the harbor of St. James, the chief city on Beaver Island, by Wentworth and Bedford, who shot him in the back.

Strang was hit three times: one bullet grazed his head, another bullet lodged in his cheek and a third bullet lodged in his spine, paralyzing him from the waist down. One of the assassins then pistol-whipped the victim before running aboard the nearby vessel with his companion, where both claimed sanctuary. Some accused Captain McBlair of the &quot;Michigan&quot; of being complicit in, or at least of having foreknowledge of, the assassination plot, though no hard evidence to support their accusation was ever forthcoming. The &quot;King of Beaver Island&quot; was taken to Voree, where he lived for three weeks, dying on July 9, 1856, at the age of 43. After refusing to deliver Bedford and Wentworth to the local Sheriff of Mackinac County, Julius Granger, McBlair transported them to Mackinac Island. Once on the island Sheriff Granger first held them in an unlocked jail cell at the ‘urging’ of the citizenry and then moved to a boarding house he was keeping, Grove House. Three days later they given a ‘mock trial’ where the justice charged them $1.25 a piece for court costs, then released them where they were feted by the local citizenry. None of those involved received punishment for their alleged crimes Dr. Hezekiah D. McCulloch and Dr. J. Atkyn, with Thomas Bedford living until 1889 and Alexander Wentworth living until 1863.
==Death of a kingdom==
While Strang lingered on his deathbed in Voree, his enemies in Michigan were determined to extinguish his Beaver Island kingdom. On July 5, 1856, on what Michigan historian Byron M. Cutcheon later called &quot;the most disgraceful day in Michigan&#x27;s history,&quot; a group of non-Mormons from Mackinac and elsewhere forcibly evicted every Strangite from Beaver Island. Strang&#x27;s subjects on the island—approximately 2,600 persons—were herded onto hastily commandeered steamers, most after being robbed of their money and other personal possessions, and unceremoniously dumped onto docks along the shores of Lake Michigan. A few of them moved back to Voree, while the rest scattered across the country.

Strang refused to appoint a successor, telling his apostles to take care of their families as best they could, and await divine instruction. While his supporters endeavored to keep his church alive, Strang&#x27;s unique dogma which required his successor to be ordained by angels made his church unappealing to Latter Day Saints who were expecting to be led by a prophet. Lorenzo Dow Hickey, the last of Strang&#x27;s apostles, emerged as an ad-hoc leader until his death in 1897, followed by Wingfield W. Watson, a High Priest in Strang&#x27;s organization (until he died in 1922). However, neither of these men ever claimed Strang&#x27;s office or authority.

Left without a prophet to guide them, most of Strang&#x27;s followers (including all of his wives) departed from his church in the years after his murder. Most of them later joined the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which was established in 1860. However, a few Latter Day Saints continue to carry on Strang&#x27;s mission. Strang&#x27;s last and most important revelation, The Book of the Law of the Lord states that a prophet president is &quot;...only necessary for the establishment of the rest of God, and bringing everlasting righteousness on earth. A lesser degree of the Priesthood has frequently stood at the head of the people of God on earth&quot; (p. 251). Consequently, instead of believing that Strang&#x27;s demise and his refusal to appoint a successor are failures, they believe that they are maintaining the pure faith and awaiting the appearance of a new successor who will take the place of their fallen founders. They believe that their position is bolstered by revelations which were given by Smith and Strang in which they stated that the condemnation of the church is prophetic and a sign of general apostasy.

Today, there are several groups and individual Strangite disciples who operate autonomously. One of these groups is a corporate church which is led by a Presiding High Priest, Bill Shepard, who claims that he does not have Joseph Smith or James Strang&#x27;s authority or priesthood office. Another group, which is led by Samuel West, claims that the first faction is in error, and it also claims that by incorporating in 1961, it lost its identity as a faithful continuation of Strang&#x27;s organization. This second group claims that &quot;it&quot; is the sole true remnant of James Strang&#x27;s church. Missionary work is no longer emphasized by Strangites (as it is by the LDS and many other Latter Day Saint sects), because they tend to believe that after the murder of three prophets (Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and James Strang) God closed His dispensation to the &quot;gentiles&quot; of the West. Consequently, Strang&#x27;s church has continued to dwindle until the present day. The current membership of the corporate church comprises around 300 persons, while the Samuel West group claims to have several thousand members in the US and Africa.

While proving to be a key player in the 1844 succession struggle, Strang&#x27;s long-term influence on the Latter Day Saint movement was minimal. His doctrinal innovations had little impact outside his church, and he was largely ignored until recent historians began to reexamine his life and career. Even the county (Manitou) which he had fought to establish was abolished by the Michigan legislature in 1895, removing the last tangible remnant of Strang&#x27;s temporal empire. Of all of his efforts, Strang&#x27;s most vital (albeit unintended) one was his contribution to the Latter Day Saint religion which turned out to provide some of the impetus behind the creation of the Reorganized Church, which became a major rival of the Utah-based LDS Church and other Latter Day Saint groups—including his own.

<text>Rafah ( ) is a city in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestine. It is the capital of the Rafah Governorate of the State of Palestine, located south-west of Gaza City. In 2017, Rafah had a population of 171,889. As a result of massive bombardment and ground assaults in Gaza City and Khan Yunis by Israel during the Gaza war, about 1.4 million Palestinians are believed to be sheltering in Rafah as of February 2024.

After the 1948 Palestine war, Egypt governed the area and refugee camps for displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled from what became Israel were established. During the Suez Crisis, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) killed 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees in the Rafah refugee camp, during the 1956 Rafah massacre. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli forces occupied the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip after capturing them from Egypt. In the same year, IDF troops bulldozed and demolished 144 houses in the Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.

When Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982, Rafah was split into a Gazan part and an Egyptian part, dividing families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. The core of the city was destroyed by Israel, as well as Egypt, in order to create a large buffer zone.

Rafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Gaza&#x27;s only airport, Yasser Arafat International Airport, was located just south of the city. The airport operated from 1998 to 2001, until it was bombed and bulldozed by the Israeli military (IDF).

== Etymology ==
Over the ages the city has been known as by the ancient Egyptians, or by the Assyrians, רפיח &quot;Rāphiyaḥ&quot; by the ancient Israelites, by the Greeks, &quot;Raphia&quot; by the Romans, and &quot;Rafh&quot; by the Arab Caliphate.

In English, &quot;Rafah&quot; ( (US) or (UK)), derived from the modern Arabic, is most common, but &quot;Rafiah&quot; (from the modern Hebrew) is also used. The form &quot;Raphiah&quot; (from the ancient Hebrew) is used as well, especially in historical contexts such as the Battle of Raphiah.

== Development ==

The Ottoman–British agreement of 1 October 1906 established a boundary between Ottoman-ruled Palestine and British-ruled Egypt, from Taba to Rafah. After World War I, Palestine was also under British control, but the Egypt-Palestine Boundary was maintained to control movement of the local Bedouin. During the mid-1930s, the British enhanced the border control and Rafah evolved as a small boundary town that functioned as a trade and services centre for the semi-settled Beduin population. During World War II, it became an important British base.

Following the Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949, Rafah was located in Egypt-occupied Gaza and consequently, a Gaza–Egypt border did no longer exist. Rafah could grow without any consideration being taken of the old 1906 international boundary. In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt and all of the city was now under Israeli occupation.

In 1979, Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty that returned the Sinai, which borders the Gaza Strip, to Egyptian control. In the Peace Treaty, the re-created Gaza–Egypt border was drawn across the city of Rafah. Rafah was divided into an Egyptian and a Palestinian part, splitting up families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Families were separated, property was divided and many houses and orchards were cut across and destroyed by the new boundary, bulldozed, allegedly for security reasons. Rafah became one of the three border points between Egypt and Israel.

== Demographics ==
In 1922, Rafah&#x27;s population was 599, which increased to 1,423 in 1931, increasing again to 1,635 in 1938, and further increased to 2,220 in 1945. In 1982, the total population was approximately 10,800.

In the 1997 Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census, Rafah and its adjacent camp had a combined population of 91,181, Tall as-Sultan was listed with a further 17,141. Refugees made up 80.3% of the entire population. In the 1997 census, Rafah&#x27;s (together with Rafah camp) gender distribution was 50.5% male and 49.5% female.

In the 2006 PCBS estimate, Rafah city had a population of 71,003, Rafah camp and Tall as-Sultan form separate localities for census purposes, having populations of 59,983 and 24,418, respectively.

== History ==
=== Bronze Age Raphia ===
Rafah has a history stretching back thousands of years. It was first recorded in an inscription of Egyptian Pharaoh Seti I, from 1303 BCE as &quot;Rph&quot;, and as the first stop on Pharaoh Shoshenq I&#x27;s campaign to the Levant in 925 BCE. In 720 BCE it was the site of the Assyrian king Sargon II&#x27;s victory over the Egyptians.

=== Hellenistic and Roman periods ===
In 217 BCE the Battle of Raphia was fought between the victorious Ptolemy IV and Antiochus III. It is said to be one of the largest battles ever fought in the Levant, with over a hundred thousand soldiers and hundreds of elephants.

Antiochus III, willing to make peace with Ptolemy V, had his daughter Cleopatra I marry Ptolemy V. Their marriage took place in 193 BC in Raphia.

The town was conquered by Alexander Yannai and held by the Hasmoneans until it was rebuilt in the time of Pompey and Gabinius; the latter seems to have done the actual work of restoration for the era of the town dates from 57 BCE. Rafah is mentioned in Strabo (16, 2, 31), the Antonine Itinerary, and is depicted on the Map of Madaba.

=== Byzantine period ===
During the Byzantine period, it was a diocese, and Byzantine ceramics and coins have been found there. It was represented at the Council of Ephesus 431 CE by Bishop Romanus, but today remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church but a small Greek Orthodox presence exists.

=== Early Muslim to Mamluk periods ===
Rafah was one of the towns captured by the Rashidun army under general &#x27;Amr ibn al-&#x27;As in 635 CE, and subsequently was an important trading city during the Early Muslim period. Under the Umayyads and Abbasids, Rafah was the southernmost border of Jund Filastin (&quot;District of Palestine&quot;). According to Arab geographer al-Ya&#x27;qubi, it was the last town in the Province of Syria and on the road from Ramla to Egypt.

In 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi writes of Rafah&#x27;s former importance in the early Arab period, saying it was &quot;of old a flourishing town, with a market, and a mosque, and hostelries&quot;. However, he goes on to say that in its current state, Rafah was in ruins, but was an Ayyubid postal station on the road to Egypt after nearby Deir al-Balah.

=== Ottoman and Egyptian period ===

Rafah appeared in the 1596 Ottoman tax registers as being in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Gaza of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Gazza. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim, who paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, goats and/or bee hives. In 1799, the French Army of the Orient, led by Napoleon, passed through Rafah during the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. Rafah was the boundary between the provinces of Egypt and Syria. In 1832, the area came under Egyptian occupation of Muhammad Ali, which lasted until 1840. 

French explorer Victor Guérin, who visited Rafah in May 1863, noted two pillars of granite which the locals called &quot;Bab el Medinet,&quot; meaning &quot;The Gate of the town&quot;. In 1881, Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria wrote: &quot;Fragments of gray granite pillars, still standing, are here to be met with about the road, the fields, and the sand, and we saw one lying on the ground half buried... The pillars are the remains of an ancient temple, Raphia, and are of special importance in the eyes of the Arabs, who call them Rafah, as they mark the boundary between Egypt and Syria.&quot;

=== British period ===
On 9 January 1917, British forces captured Rafah, and subsequently used it as a staging post for their first attempt to capture Gaza. The presence of British military bases in Rafah served an economic draw which led to an influx of internal migration to the city. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandatory authorities, Rafah had a population of 599 inhabitants, all of which Muslim. Nine years later, the Mandatory authorities conducted the 1931 census of Palestine, by which time Rafah&#x27;s population had increased to 1,423 residents living in 228 houses, all of which were still Muslim.

In the Village Statistics, 1945, a joint survey conducted by the Mandatory government&#x27;s Government Office of Statistics and Department of Lands for the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, Rafah had an all-Muslim population of 2,220 people with 40,579 dunams of land. Of these, 275 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 24,173 dunams were used for growing cereals, while 16,131 dunams were un-cultivable land.

=== 1948–1967 ===

After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt governed the area (see Palestinian Protectorate) and refugee camps were established. During the Suez Crisis, 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees, were killed by troops of the Israel Defence Force in the Palestinian refugee camp of Rafah, during the 1956 Rafah massacre. The United Nations was unable to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths.

During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli forces captured Rafah as part of their invasion of the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. The population was about 55,000, of whom only 11,000 lived in Rafah itself. On Friday, 9 June 1967, the Israeli military bulldozed &amp; blew up 144 houses in Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.

=== After 1967 ===
In the summer of 1971, the IDF, under General Ariel Sharon (then head of the IDF southern command), destroyed approximately 500 houses in the refugee camps of Rafah in order to create patrol roads for Israeli forces. These demolitions displaced nearly 4,000 people. Israel established the Brazil and Canada housing projects to accommodate displaced Palestinians and to provide better conditions in the hopes of integrating the refugees into the general population and its standard of living; Brazil is immediately south of Rafah, while Canada was just across the border in Sinai. Both were named because UN peacekeeping troops from those respective countries had maintained barracks in those locations. After the 1978 Camp David Accords mandated the repatriation of Canada project refugees to the Gaza Strip, the Tel al-Sultan project, northwest of Rafah, was built to accommodate them.
During the early months of First Intifada on 25 April 1989 Rafah resident Khaled Musa Armilat, aged 22, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in Khan Yunis. In a letter to a Member of Knesset, March 1990, Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin stated that the dead man&#x27;s brother had been interrogated and stated that he had been killed by Border Police but four months later he blamed the army. Rabin added the matter was being investigated by the Israeli Police.
Three and a half weeks after Armilat&#x27;s killing, 19 May, five civilians including a 50-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy, were killed in Rafah by Israeli soldiers using plastic bullets. Two of the 12 other casualties later died of their wounds.

In May 2004, the Israeli Government led by, then Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon approved another mass demolition of homes in Rafah. Therefore, he obtained the nickname &quot;the bulldozer&quot;.

In September 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza strip but Rafah remained divided, with part of it on the Egyptian side of the border under Egyptian rule. It has been claimed that it was in order to cope with the division of the town, that smugglers have made tunnels under the border, connecting the two parts and permitting the smuggling of goods and persons.

=== 2023–2024 Gaza war ===

During the Israeli Defence Forces&#x27; (IDF) war on Gaza, civilians were told to flee to Rafah and forcibly displaced from their homes. Although the Israeli government declared the southern half of Gaza a safe zone, the IDF proceeded to bomb the region extensively, with a &quot;New York Times&quot; investigation estimating that 2,000-pound bombs were dropped at least 200 times as of 21 December 2023. By February 2024, roughly two-thirds of Gaza&#x27;s population, or 1.4 million people, had been forcibly displaced from other parts of the territory into Rafah, with the IDF declaring its intent to enter the city. Critics have warned about the potential for mass civilian casualties in the event of a ground invasion, with the UN secretary general António Guterres arguing that &quot;&quot;Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences.&quot;&quot; On 9 February, Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the IDF to create an evacuation plan to remove civilians before launching an offensive against Rafah which is the last major population center in the Gaza Strip still under Hamas control and the elimination of Hamas was considered to be impossible as long as the four Hamas battalions in Rafah are intact. Prior to the start of the ground invasion, Israel began to intensify its strikes on Rafah from the air. More than 44 people were killed in airstrikes on Rafah on 11 February, with many likely still under the rubble. Netanyahu continued to push for a ground invasion, claiming that &quot;We&#x27;re going to do it...Victory is within reach&quot;.

On 11 February, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Egypt had warned Hamas to release hostages within two weeks or face an IDF invasion of Rafah. A joint operation in Rafah by the IDF, Shin Bet, and Israel Police recovered two hostages (Fernando Simon Marman and Louis Har) kidnapped by Hamas from Nir Yitzhak. During this operation, heavy bombardment by the IDF occurred in the area that includes many refugee camps killing 112 people with several bodies still under the rubble.

== Rafah Border Crossing ==

Rafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Formerly operated by Israeli military forces, control of the crossing was transferred to the Palestinian Authority in September 2005 as part of the larger Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. A European Union commission began monitoring the crossing in November 2005 amid Israeli security concerns, and in April 2006, Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas&#x27;s Presidential Guard assumed responsibility for the site on the Palestinian Authority side. On the Egyptian side, the responsibility is assumed by the 750 Border Guards as per the agreement signed by Egypt and Israel in November 2005.

<doc id="584377" wikidata="Q17010699" url="?curid=584377" title="List of English words of Etruscan origin">
<text>This is a list of English words that may be of Etruscan origin, and were borrowed through Latin, often via French. The Etruscan origin of most of these words is disputed, and some may be of Indo-European or other origin. The question is made more complex by the fact that the Etruscans borrowed many Greek words in modified form. Typically if a Latin word has an unknown, uncertain or disputed origin, it is considered a possible candidate for deriving in whole or in part from an Etruscan word; however, native Etruscan must then be distinguished from Greek. If no Etruscan word is clearly identifiable sometimes an attempt is made to reconstruct one. Etruscan derivations therefore are highly variable in probability; that is, some are highly speculative and others more likely.

==List==
; ace : from Middle English &quot;aas&quot;, from Old French &quot;as&quot;, from Latin &quot;as&quot;, &quot;a whole, a unit, copper coin&quot;, possibly Etruscan. &quot;As&quot; was a Roman coin and was also a unit of weight equal to about one troy pound.
; antenna : from &quot;antenna&quot; &lt; &quot;antemna&quot;, &quot;yard-arm, sail&quot;. Possibly Etruscan *antithemna &gt; *ant(th)emna from Greek ἀνατιθέμενος anatithémenos, something set up.
; Anthony : from Latin &quot; Antōnius&quot;, a Roman gens claimed by Marcus Antonius to descend from Ἄντων (Ántōn), a son of Heracles, but the gens is probably Etruscan in origin, most likely derived from Ani, the Etruscan god of the sky. Previous claims asserted an Ancient Greek (compare ἄνθος &quot;ánthos&quot;, “flower” or &quot;ἄνθρωπος&quot;, &quot;man, human&quot;) origin with an unetymological excrescent &quot;-h-&quot; but this remains dubious.
; April : Latin &quot;aprilis&quot; probably from Etruscan form &quot;apera-&quot; (found the Tabula Capuana, a ritual calendar line 8--the next section mentions May &quot;anpile&quot;), which form may come from Greek Aphrodite. There is also a gloss that equates Etruscan &quot;&lt;c&gt;Abreus&quot; with Latin &quot;Aprilis mensis&quot;.
; arena : from &quot;arēna&quot; &quot;arena&quot; &lt; &quot;harēna&quot;, &quot;arena, sand&quot; &lt; archaic &quot;hasēna&quot; &lt; Sabine &quot;fasēna&quot;, unknown Etruscan word as the basis for &quot;fas-&quot; with Etruscan ending &quot;-ēna&quot;.
; atrium : From Latin &quot;atrium&quot; which both Breyer and Bonfante consider to be a likely loan from Etruscan (along with other architectural terms such as &quot;fenestra&quot; &quot;window&quot; and &quot;cella&quot; &quot;chamber&quot;). But both Watkins and de Vaan trace it back to Proto-Indo-European (though they disagree on the exact root).
; autumn : from &quot;autumnus&quot; &quot;autumn&quot;. Just as Etruscan &quot;veltha&quot;, an earth god, appears as Latin Vola or Olta and is in Voltumna and Vertumnus, so the parallel construction autumnus ought to come from Etruscan autu-, related to avil, &quot;year&quot;: *av(i)-to-m(e)nos, with loss of the l. There are some names with both l and t: avlethaium, authnal, avtle, and so on, which appear related to autu or auta in Venetic, the idea being that autumn signifies the passing of the year.
; belt : from &quot;balteus&quot;, &quot;sword belt.&quot; The sole connection between this word and Etruscan is a statement by Marcus Terentius Varro that it was of Etruscan origin. All else is speculation.
; catamite : Latin, from Etruscan &quot;catmite&quot;, from the Ancient Greek &quot;Ganymede&quot;, cupbearer to Zeus. Bonfante and most others accept this etymology.
; ceremony : possibly Etruscan or possibly referring to Etruscan rites performed at Caere.
; defenestration, : Both Bonfante and Whatmough accept the probability that Latin &quot;fenestra&quot; was a loan from a derivative of Etruscan &quot;fnes-&quot;. Some of the other reasonably certain loans also deal with elements of architecture, for example &quot;atrium&quot; and &quot;cella.&quot;
; element : from &quot;elementum&quot;, &#x27;letter&#x27;.
; : from &quot;histrionicus&quot;, from &quot;histrio&quot;, &quot;actor&quot;.
; letter : from Old French &quot;lettre&quot;, from Latin &quot;littera&quot;, which may have derived, via Etruscan, from the Greek &quot;διφθέρα&quot; (writing tablet).
; mantissa :
; market :
; military : Etruscan or perhaps related to Greek &quot;homilos&quot;, &quot;assembled crowd&quot; (compare &quot;homily&quot;).
; mundane : from &quot;mundus&quot;, &#x27;earth&#x27;, from &quot;munth&quot;, &#x27;land&#x27;.
; mutule :
; palace, palate, palatine : One of the seven hills of Rome. Either from Latin &quot;palus&quot; &quot;stake&quot; or the Etruscan shepherd goddess &quot;Pales&quot;.
; people :From Latin &quot;populus&quot; by way of Old French &quot;peuple&quot;, possibly of Etruscan origin. After a lengthy discussion, Whatmough concludes that it is not completely certain that Latin &quot;populus&quot; is an Etruscan loanword, but that such an etymology is &quot;satisfactory at the morphological and phonological levels.&quot;
; person : from Middle English &quot;persone&quot;, from Old French &quot;persone&quot;, from Latin &quot;persona&quot;, &quot;mask&quot;, probably from Etruscan &quot;phersu&quot;, &quot;mask&quot;. Another sources, however, links the Etruscan word as a derivative of Greek πρὀσωπον &quot;prosōpon&quot;, &quot;mask&quot;.
; Rome : from &#x27;Ruma&#x27;, the name of one of the Etruscan tribes, or &#x27;Rumon&#x27;, which was what the Etruscans called the Tiber River, possibly of Etruscan origin as &quot;ruma&quot; was one of the Etruscan gentes, from &quot;rum&quot;, “teat”.
;satellite : from Latin &quot;satelles&quot;, meaning &quot;bodyguard, attendant&quot;, perhaps from Etruscan &quot;satnal&quot;. Bonfante, otherwise quite skeptical of many proposed loans, calls it &quot;quite likely&quot; that Latin &quot;satteles&quot; is from Etruscan. Whatmough considers Latin &quot;satteles&quot; &quot;as one of our securest Etruscan loans in Latin.&quot;
; Serge (first name)
; : the word &quot;serve&quot; derives from Latin &quot;servire&quot; (&#x27;to serve&#x27;) and &quot;servus&quot; (&#x27;a slave&#x27;), which have sometimes been thought to derive from Etruscan. However, a detailed analysis has preferred an Indo-European etymology for the Latin word.
; spurious : From Latin &quot;spurius&quot; &quot;born out of wedlock, illegitimate&quot; from Etruscan &quot;spur-al&quot; &quot;of the city&quot; because, as Pisani proposed, children not claimed by their fathers were considered to belong to the city. Whatmough, however, rejects Pisani&#x27;s claim, both because of the late attestation of the Latin term, but also because the Etruscan root &quot;spur&quot; is now seen as meaning &quot;community&quot; not &quot;city&quot;; and furthermore, in any case, the form that would have to be the immediate predecessor of Latin &quot;spurius&quot; would have to be Etruscan &quot;spurie&quot; which may have a different meaning, and in one instance seems to be the name of a person with a named father.
; triumph : From Old Latin &quot;triumpus,&quot; probably a loan word via Etruscan from Greek thriambos, a hymn to Dionysus.
; vernacular : from &quot;vernaculus&quot;, &#x27;domestic&#x27;, from &quot;verna&quot;, &#x27;a native slave&#x27;.
; viburnum : from Latin &quot;viburnum&quot;, likely Etruscan in origin. Compare &quot;laburnum, alaternus, basterna, lacerna, santerna, pincerna, clarnus&quot;, all strongly suspected to be derived from Etruscan or related languages.

<text>Koeberg Nuclear Power Station is a nuclear power station in South Africa and was the first one built on the African continent. It is located 30 km north of Cape Town, near Melkbosstrand on the west coast. It is owned and operated by the country&#x27;s state-owned electricity public utility, Eskom.

==Design==
Koeberg contains two pressurised water reactors based on a design by Framatome of France. Framatome has a 51% shareholding in local South African company Lesedi Nuclear Services which performs upgrade and maintenance projects at Koeberg. Koeberg supplies power to the national grid so that over-capacity can be redistributed to the rest of the country on an as-needed basis. Fuel stock used within the reactor is enriched uranium dioxide pellets containing gadolinium, contained in fuel rods. Koeberg is rated at 1,860 MW, its average annual production is 13,668 GWh and it has two turbine generators.&amp;.

Each reactor delivers 970 MW (gross) and is capable of delivering 930 MW (net) to the grid.

The power station was constructed near Cape Town to be the sole provider of power in the Western Cape after fossil-fuel power stations were deemed too small and too expensive to be viable. Nuclear power was considered because it was more economical than transporting coal to the existing fossil-fuel power stations, and construction of new fossil-fuel power-stations, which would have required 300 m tall chimneys to comply with clean-air legislation. Athlone Power Station in the city was too small to provide Cape Town&#x27;s needs, and the Paarden Island power station (also too small) has been demolished.

Koeberg was one of the first nuclear power stations designed to be resistant to earthquakes. The reactors at the Koeberg nuclear power station are built on an aseismic raft designed – on the basis of a mid-1970s hazard study - to withstand a magnitude 7 earthquake at a focal distance of about 10 km, 0.3g zero period ground acceleration (ZPGA). The largest recorded earthquake in the Cape Town area has been 6.5 magnitude at Jan Biesjes Kraal in 1809.

The reactor at Koeberg is cooled by cold water from the Atlantic Ocean pumped through an isolated circuit at 80 tons a second. Low and intermediate level waste from Koeberg is transported by road in steel and concrete containers to a rural disposal site at Vaalputs, 600 km away in the Kalahari Desert.

The power station was originally located outside the metropolitan area, but urban growth has exceeded expectations in the intervening years, so that the power station is now close to suburban housing. The administration enforces maximum housing density regulations in case of evacuation, which precludes the construction of high rise buildings. The buffer zone around the nuclear power station forms the 22 km2 Koeberg Nature Reserve, open to the public and containing more than 210 species of birds and a number of mammal species including zebra, eland and springbok.

==History==

Construction of the power station began in 1976, and Unit 1 was synchronized to the grid on 4 April 1984. Unit 2 followed on 25 July 1985.

On 17 December 1982, Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the ANC attacked Koeberg while it was still under construction. Damage was estimated at R 500 million and the commissioning of the power station was put back by 18 months. The bomber was Rodney Wilkinson, who had previously represented South Africa in international fencing tournaments.

In August 2002 twelve Greenpeace activists obtained access to the station. Six of them scaled the wall to hang up an anti-nuclear protest banner. The twelve were arrested and fined.

At the end of 2005, Koeberg started experiencing numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on a transmission busbar caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply to most of the Western Cape for about two hours. On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.

On Sunday 25 December 2005, the generator of Unit 1 was damaged. While the generator was being powered up after scheduled refuelling and maintenance, a loose bolt, which was left inside the generator caused severe damage, forcing it to be shut down. Subsequent to the unexpected unavailability of Unit 1, Unit 2 was also brought down for scheduled refuelling, resulting in a severe shortage of supply to the Western Cape. This resulted in widespread load shedding in order to maintain the stability of the network. A replacement rotor for Unit 1 was shipped in from France and the unit was brought back into operation in May 2006.

On 18 and 19 February 2007 large parts of the Western Cape again experienced blackouts due to a controlled shutdown of Koeberg. According to Eskom and the City of Cape Town, power cuts were to continue until 26 February 2007, however power supply problems continued beyond this date.

The estimated economic losses due to the power cuts was over R 500 M as at February 2007, and was estimated to rise to possibly as high as R 2 billion.

On 12 September 2010, 91 members of staff were contaminated with cobalt-58 dust in an incident that appeared confined to the station.

The government&#x27;s agreed 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) plans a 20-year life-extension for Koeberg to 2044, and a delayed nuclear new build programme with a scenario that may build new capacity after 2030.

On 10 September 2020, Eskom announced it will replace six steam generators. The design, manufacture and install contract with Areva was for ZAR 4.4 billion ($240 million), with manufacture subcontracted to the Shanghai Electric Power. Installation was delayed to 2023 and 2024 because of concerns about possible power shortages. Koeberg 1&#x27;s outage began on 10 December 2022 and it came back synchronised with the grid on 18 November 2023, taking much longer than the expected six months. Koeberg 2 will begin its outage once Koeberg 1&#x27;s recommissioning tests are complete.

In 2022, the &quot;Daily Maverick&quot; reported that Eskom&#x27;s then Chief Nuclear Officer, Riedewaan Bakardien had left the utility, also noting an Eskom estimated loss of between 250 and 300 &quot;skilled persons&quot; in 2022, putting at risk the planned R20 billion life extension.

==Post Fukushima stress tests==
After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, seismic safety at Koeberg was reevaluated in conjunction with the IAEA. Although Koeberg was designed for 0.3g zero period ground acceleration (ZPGA), a magnitude 7 earthquake, stress tests evaluated Koeberg against a 0.5g ZPGA.
Overall Koeberg was found to be seismically robust and well designed, with some areas for attention and improvement that were highlighted.

==New build==

Duynefontein next door on the northern side of Koeberg is a proposed site for a new nuclear power station.

==Opposition to Koeberg==
South Africa&#x27;s nuclear industry has seen opposition, chiefly from environmentalists concerned about safety issues such as radioactive waste, and anti-war activists concerned about nuclear proliferation and use of atomic weapons. Current campaigns against nuclear energy are being run by Earthlife Africa and Koeberg Alert.

<text>The BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award is an award given annually as part of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony each December. The award is given to a sportsperson &quot;who has made a major impact on the world of sport during their lifetime&quot;. The winner is selected by BBC Sport. When football manager Alex Ferguson won the award in 2001, the BBC described the award as &quot;a new accolade&quot; to be presented annually; however, two people had already received the Lifetime Achievement Award.

==History==
The inaugural recipient of the award was Frank Bruno in 1996, who won it after his retirement from boxing that year. Bruno was the favourite to win the main award in 1995, but lost to Damon Hill, causing many to criticise his Lifetime Achievement Award as being a consolation award. Spanish golfer Seve Ballesteros won the award the following year, but after that the award was not presented for three years. The award has been presented annually since Ferguson ended the hiatus in 2001. Five of the eleven recipients have been associated with football; tennis and golf are the only other sports to have been represented more than once. Tennis player Martina Navratilova was the first woman to have won the award. The only recipient of the award on multiple occasions is Ballesteros who won in 1997 and again in 2009, for his contribution to golf winning &quot;the Open three times, the Masters twice as well as playing an inspirational role in the Ryder Cup&quot;. The most recent winner, in 2024, was cyclist Mark Cavendish.

<doc id="584389" wikidata="Q5418363" url="?curid=584389" title="Evidentialism">
<text>Evidentialism is a thesis in epistemology which states that one is justified to believe something if and only if that person has evidence which supports said belief. Evidentialism is, therefore, a thesis about which beliefs are justified and which are not. 

For philosophers Richard Feldman and Earl Conee, evidentialism is the strongest argument for justification because it identifies the primary notion of epistemic justification. They argue that if a person&#x27;s attitude towards a proposition fits their evidence, then their doxastic attitude for that proposition is epistemically justified. Feldman and Conee offer the following argument for evidentialism as an epistemic justification:

(EJ) Doxastic attitude &quot;D&quot; toward proposition &quot;p&quot; is epistemically justified for &quot;S&quot; at &quot;t&quot; if and only if having &quot;D&quot; toward &quot;p&quot; fits the evidence.

For Feldman and Conee one&#x27;s doxastic attitude is justified if it fits one&#x27;s evidence. EJ is meant to show the idea that justification is characteristically epistemic. This idea makes justification dependent on evidence.

Feldman and Conee believe that because objections to EJ have become so prominent their defense for it is appropriate. The theses that object EJ are implying that epistemic justification is dependent upon the &quot;cognitive capacities of an individual or upon the cognitive processes or information-gatherings practices that lead to an attitude.&quot; For Feldman and Conee, EJ is in contrast to these theses; EJ contends that the epistemic justification for an attitude is only dependent upon evidence. 

==Criticism==
Critics of evidentialism sometimes reject the claim that a conclusion is justified only if one&#x27;s evidence supports that conclusion. A typical counterexample goes like this. Suppose, for example, that Babe Ruth approaches the batter&#x27;s box believing that he will hit a home run despite his current drunkenness and overall decline in performance in recent games. He realizes that, however unlikely it is that his luck will change, it would increase his chances of hitting a home run if he maintains a confident attitude. In these circumstances, critics of evidentialism argue that his belief that &quot;p = Babe Ruth will hit a home run&quot; is justified, even though his evidence does not support this belief.

Evidentialists may respond to this criticism by forming a distinction between &quot;pragmatic&quot; or &quot;prudential justification&quot; and &quot;epistemic justification&quot;. In Babe Ruth&#x27;s case, it is pragmatically justified that he believe &quot;p&quot;, but it is nevertheless epistemically unjustified: though the belief may be justified for the purpose of promoting some other goal (a successful at bat, in Ruth&#x27;s case), it is not justified relative to the purely epistemic goal of having beliefs that are most likely to be true.

A similar response follows the criticism that evidentialism implies all faith-based beliefs are unjustified. For example, fideism claims that evidence is irrelevant to religious beliefs and that attempts to justify religious beliefs in such a way are misguided. Superficially, fideism and evidentialism have mutually exclusive takes on religious beliefs, but evidentialists use the term &quot;justification&quot; in a much weaker sense than the one in which fideists most likely use it. Evidentialism merely defines the epistemic condition of a belief.

Although evidentialism states that the content of the evidence does not matter, only that it constitutes valid justification towards some proposition, a skeptical criticism may be levelled at evidentialism from uncertainty theories. One&#x27;s evidence may be objectively disproved at some point or it may be the case that one can never have absolute certainty of one&#x27;s evidence. Given the logic of arguments concerning principles of uncertainty and randomness, skepticism towards knowledge merely becomes skepticism towards valid justification.

Likewise, some say that the human mind is not naturally inclined to form beliefs based on evidence, viz. cognitive dissonance. While this may be the case, evidentialists admit, evidentialism is only meant to separate justified beliefs from unjustified beliefs. One can believe that evidentialism is true yet still maintain that the human mind is not naturally inclined to form beliefs based on evidence. He would simply have to conclude that the mind is not naturally inclined to form justified beliefs.

==Infinite regress argument==
Evidentialism also faces a challenge from the infinite regress argument. This argument begins with the observation that, normally, one&#x27;s supporting evidence for a belief consists of other beliefs. However, it seems that these other beliefs can do the job of justifying only if they themselves are already justified. And evidentialism demands that these supporting beliefs be justified by still further evidence if they are to be justified themselves. But this same reasoning would apply to the new, deeper level of supporting beliefs: they can only justify if they&#x27;re themselves justified, and evidentialism therefore demands an even deeper level of supporting belief. According to this argument, a justified belief requires an endless supply of reasons. Some philosophers such as Thomas Nagel posit that this is an absurd conclusion.

In general, responses to this argument can be classified in the following ways:
* Foundationalism: There exist beliefs that are justified, but not because they are based on any other beliefs. These are called properly basic beliefs, and they are the foundation upon which all other justified beliefs ultimately rest.
* Coherentism: Justified beliefs are all evidentially supported by other beliefs, but an infinite set of beliefs is not generated, because the chains of evidential support among beliefs is allowed to move in a circle. On the resulting picture, a person&#x27;s belief is justified when it fits together with the person&#x27;s other beliefs in a coherent way in which the person&#x27;s various beliefs mutually support one another.
: A modest reasoner subset of Coherentism would insist that all justifiable beliefs be statements about &quot;some objects&quot; since the negation/complement of a some statement is another some statement.
* Skepticism: There cannot be any justified beliefs.
: A modest reasoner subset of Scepticism like the subset of Coherentism would likewise insist and define all justifiable beliefs be statements about &quot;some objects&quot; since the negation/complement of a some statement is another some statement.
* Infinitism: Aside from these responses, some philosophers have said that evidential chains terminate in beliefs that are not justified. Others have said that, indeed, there can exist infinite chains of reasons.

Of the main responses, coherentism and skepticism are clearly consistent with evidentialism. Coherentism allows evidential support for all of our justified beliefs in the face of the regress argument by allowing for circular chains of evidential support among beliefs. And the skeptic here is utilizing an evidentialist demand to arrive at her skeptical conclusion.

But because the resulting skepticism is so sweeping and devastating, and because so many reject the legitimacy of the circular reasoning embraced by the coherentist, foundationalism is the favored response of many philosophers to the regress argument. And foundationalism does not so clearly fit together with evidentialism. At first glance, at least, the &quot;basic&quot; beliefs of the foundationalist would appear to be counterexamples to the evidentialist&#x27;s thesis, in that they are justified beliefs that are not rational because they are not supported by deeper evidence.

==Non-evidentialist theories of knowledge and justification==

Many contemporary epistemologists reject the view that evidential support is the whole story about the justification of beliefs. While no sensible epistemologists generally urge people to disregard their evidence when forming beliefs, many believe that a more complete theory would introduce considerations about the processes that initiate and sustain beliefs. An example of one such theory is reliabilism. The most influential proponent of reliabilism is Alvin Goldman. According to a crude form of reliabilism, &quot;S&quot; is justified in believing &quot;p&quot; if and only if &quot;S&quot;&#x27;s belief in &quot;p&quot; is caused by a reliable process—a process that generally leads to true beliefs. Some of these reliable processes may require the processing of evidence; many others won&#x27;t. So, Goldman would argue, evidentialism, on which the justification of a belief always turns completely on the issue of the belief&#x27;s evidential support, is false. Likewise, evidentialism will be rejected by more sophisticated versions of reliabilism, some of which will allow evidence an important but limited role, as opposed to the all-encompassing role assigned to it by evidentialism.

Other non-evidentialist theories include: the causal theory, according to which &quot;S&quot; knows &quot;p&quot; if and only if &quot;S&quot;&#x27;s belief in &quot;p&quot; is causally connected in an appropriate way with &quot;S&quot;&#x27;s believing &quot;p&quot;; and Robert Nozick&#x27;s truth tracking theory, according to which &quot;S&quot; knows &quot;p&quot; if and only if (i) &quot;p&quot; is true, (ii) &quot;S&quot; believes &quot;p&quot;, (iii) &quot;S&quot;&#x27;s attitude toward &quot;p&quot; tracks the truth value of &quot;p&quot; in that, when &quot;p&quot; is not true, &quot;S&quot; does not believe &quot;p&quot; and when &quot;p&quot; is true, &quot;S&quot; does believe &quot;p&quot;.

Another alternative perspective, promoted by David Hume&#x27;s 18th-century opponent, Presbyterian philosopher Thomas Reid, and perhaps hinted at by Hume himself, at least in some moods (though this is a very controversial issue in interpreting Hume), has it that some of our &quot;natural&quot; beliefs—beliefs we are led to form by natural features of the human constitution—have what can be called an &quot;innocent-until-proven-guilty&quot; status. Contrary to evidentialism, they can be justified in the absence of any effective evidence that supports them. They are justified just so long as one doesn&#x27;t have good reason to think them false.

A new account of the extent of our evidence is Timothy Williamson&#x27;s claim that &quot;E=K&quot;: one&#x27;s evidence is what one knows. Going by the &quot;letter of the law,&quot; Williamson&#x27;s resulting theory is not contrary to, but is rather an instance of, evidentialism. By allowing our evidence to encompass everything we know, Williamson is able to give thoroughly evidentialist accounts of many important epistemological concepts. But, traditionally, evidentialists have presupposed much more restrictive accounts of what our evidence is. Thus, Williamson&#x27;s theory is opposed to the spirit of much traditional evidentialism, primarily because it turns evidentialism from an internalist account of justification to an externalist account (due to the factive nature of knowledge.) However, Williamson&#x27;s work may point to a quite general way to modify traditional evidentialism to make it better able to meet the challenges it faces: whether or not one goes so far as to accept that &quot;E=K&quot;, broadening one&#x27;s view of what constitutes our evidence may provide a way to address many of the objections to evidentialism, especially to those disinclined to swallow skeptical consequences of a view

<text>The , also Lewchewan or Luchuan (), are the indigenous languages of the Ryukyu Islands, the southernmost part of the Japanese archipelago. Along with the Japanese language and the Hachijō language, they make up the Japonic language family.

Just as among Japanese dialects it is hard to understand each other, the Ryukyu and mainland Japanese languages are not mutually intelligible. It is not known how many speakers of these languages remain, but language shift toward the use of Standard Japanese and dialects like Okinawan Japanese has resulted in these languages becoming endangered; UNESCO labels four of the languages &quot;definitely endangered&quot; and two others &quot;severely endangered&quot;.

==Overview==
Phonologically, the Ryukyuan languages have some cross-linguistically unusual features. Southern Ryukyuan languages have a number of syllabic consonants, including unvoiced syllabic fricatives (e.g. Ōgami Miyako &#x27;breast&#x27;). Glottalized consonants are common (e.g. Yuwan Amami &quot;horse&quot;). Some Ryukyuan languages have a central close vowel rather than the more common front and back close vowels [i] and [u], e.g. Yuwan Amami &quot;tree&quot;. Ikema Miyako has a voiceless nasal phoneme . Many Ryukyuan languages, like Standard Japanese and most Japanese dialects, have contrastive pitch accent.

Ryukyuan languages are generally SOV, dependent-marking, modifier-head, nominative-accusative languages, like Japanese. Adjectives are generally bound morphemes, occurring either with noun compounding or using verbalization. Many Ryukyuan languages mark both nominatives and genitives with the same marker. This marker has the unusual feature of changing form depending on an animacy hierarchy. The Ryukyuan languages have topic and focus markers, which may take different forms depending on the sentential context. Ryukyuan also preserves a special verbal inflection for clauses with focus markers—this unusual feature was also found in Old Japanese, but lost in Modern Japanese.

==Classification and varieties==
The Ryukyuan languages belong to the Japonic language family, related to the Japanese language. The Ryukyuan languages are not mutually intelligible with Japanese—in fact, they are not even mutually intelligible with each other—and thus are usually considered separate languages. However, for socio-political and ideological reasons, they have often been classified within Japan as dialects of Japanese. Since the beginning of World War II, most mainland Japanese have regarded the Ryukyuan languages as a dialect or group of dialects of Japanese.

The Okinawan language is only 71% lexically similar to, or cognate with, standard Japanese. Even the southernmost Japanese dialect (Kagoshima dialect) is only 72% cognate with the northernmost Ryukyuan language (Amami). The Kagoshima dialect of Japanese, however, is 80% lexically similar to Standard Japanese. There is general agreement among linguistics experts that Ryukyuan varieties can be divided into six languages, conservatively, with dialects unique to islands within each group also sometimes considered languages.

A widely accepted hypothesis among linguists categorizes the Ryukyuan languages into two groups, Northern Ryukyuan (Amami–Okinawa) and Southern Ryukyuan (Miyako–Yaeyama). Many speakers of the Amami, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni languages may also be familiar with Okinawan since Okinawan has the most speakers and once acted as the regional standard. Speakers of Yonaguni are also likely to know the Yaeyama language due to its proximity. Since Amami, Miyako, Yaeyama, and Yonaguni are less urbanized than the Okinawan mainland, their languages are not declining as quickly as that of Okinawa proper, and some children continue to be brought up in these languages.

Each Ryukyuan language is generally unintelligible to others in the same family. There is wide diversity among them. For example, Yonaguni has only three vowels, whereas varieties of Amami may have up to seven, excluding length distinctions. The table below illustrates the different phrases used in each language for &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;welcome&quot;, with standard Japanese provided for comparison.

==Status==
There is no census data for the Ryukyuan languages, and the number of speakers is unknown. As of 2005, the total population of the Ryukyu region was 1,452,288, but fluent speakers are restricted to the older generation, generally in their 50s or older, and thus the true number of Ryukyuan speakers is likely much lower.

The six Ryukyuan languages are listed in the UNESCO Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger. UNESCO said all Ryukyuan languages are on course for extinction by 2050.

Starting in the 1890s, the Japanese government began to suppress the Ryukyuan languages as part of their policy of forced assimilation in the islands.

Children being raised in the Ryukyuan languages are becoming increasingly rare throughout the islands, and usually occurs only when the children are living with their grandparents. The Ryukyuan languages are still used in traditional cultural activities, such as folk music, folk dance, poem and folk plays. There has also been a radio news program in the Naha dialect since 1960.

Circa 2007, in Okinawa, people under the age of 40 have little proficiency in the native Okinawan language. A new mixed language, based on Japanese and Okinawan, has developed, known as &quot;Okinawan Japanese&quot;. Although it has been largely ignored by linguists and language activists, this is the language of choice among the younger generation.

Similarly, the common language now used in everyday conversations in Amami Ōshima is not the traditional Amami language, but rather a regional variation of Amami-accented Japanese, known as Amami Japanese. It’s locally known as (&quot;Ton Futsūgo&quot;, literally meaning &quot;potato [i.e. rustic] common language&quot;).

To try to preserve the language, the Okinawan Prefectural government proclaimed on March 31, 2006, that September 18 would be commemorated as , as the day&#x27;s numerals in &quot;goroawase&quot; spell out &quot;ku&quot; (9), &quot;tu&quot; (10), &quot;ba&quot; (8); &quot;kutuba&quot; is one of the few words common throughout the Ryukyuan languages meaning &quot;word&quot; or &quot;language&quot; (a cognate of the Japanese word ). A similar commemoration is held in the Amami region on February 18 beginning in 2007, proclaimed as by Ōshima Subprefecture in Kagoshima Prefecture. Each island has its own name for the event:
*Amami Ōshima: or (also written )
*Kikaijima: 
*Tokunoshima: or 
*Okinoerabujima: 
*Yoronjima: .
Yoronjima&#x27;s &quot;fu&quot; (2) &quot;tu&quot; (10) &quot;ba&quot; (8) is the &quot;goroawase&quot; source of the February 18 date, much like with Okinawa Prefecture&#x27;s use of &quot;kutuba&quot;.

==History==

It is generally accepted that the Ryukyu Islands were populated by Proto-Japonic speakers in the first millennium, and since then relative isolation allowed the Ryukyuan languages to diverge significantly from the varieties of Proto-Japonic spoken in Mainland Japan, which would later be known as Old Japanese. However, the discoveries of the Pinza-Abu Cave Man, the Minatogawa Man, and the Yamashita Cave Man as well as the Shiraho Saonetabaru Cave Ruins suggest an earlier arrival to the island by modern humans. Some researchers suggest that the Ryukyuan languages are most likely to have evolved from a &quot;pre-Proto-Japonic language&quot; from the Korean peninsula. However, Ryukyuan may have already begun to diverge from Proto-Japonic before this migration, while its speakers still dwelt in the main islands of Japan. After this initial settlement, there was little contact between the main islands and the Ryukyu Islands for centuries, allowing Ryukyuan and Japanese to diverge as separate linguistic entities from each other. This situation lasted until the Kyushu-based Satsuma Domain conquered the Ryukyu Islands in the 17th century.

In 1846-1849 first Protestant missionary in Ryukyu Bernard Jean Bettelheim studied local languages, partially translated the Bible into them and published first grammar of Shuri Ryukyuan.

The Ryukyu Kingdom retained its autonomy until 1879, when it was annexed by Japan. The Japanese government adopted a policy of forced assimilation, appointing mainland Japanese to political posts and suppressing native culture and language. Students caught speaking the Ryukyuan languages were made to wear a &quot;dialect card&quot; (方言札 &quot;hōgen fuda&quot;), a method of public humiliation. Students who regularly wore the card would receive corporal punishment. In 1940, there was a political debate amongst Japanese leaders about whether or not to continue the oppression of the Ryukyuan languages, although the argument for assimilation prevailed. In the World War II era, speaking the Ryukyuan languages was officially illegal, although in practice the older generation was still monolingual. During the Battle of Okinawa, many Okinawans were labeled as spies and executed for speaking the Okinawan language. This policy of linguicide lasted into the post-war occupation of the Ryukyu Islands by the United States. As the American occupation forces generally promoted the reforming of a separate Ryukyuan culture, many Okinawan officials continued to strive for Japanification as a form of defiance.

Nowadays, in favor of multiculturalism, preserving Ryukyuan languages has become the policy of Okinawa Prefectural government, as well as the government of Kagoshima Prefecture&#x27;s Ōshima Subprefecture. However, the situation is not very optimistic, since the vast majority of Okinawan children are now monolingual in Japanese.

==Geographic distribution==
The Ryukyuan languages are spoken on the Ryukyu Islands, which comprise the southernmost part of the Japanese archipelago. There are four major island groups which make up the Ryukyu Islands: the Amami Islands, the Okinawa Islands, the Miyako Islands, and the Yaeyama Islands. The former is in the Kagoshima Prefecture, while the latter three are in the Okinawa Prefecture.

==Orthography==
Older Ryukyuan texts are often found on stone inscriptions. &quot;Tamaudun-no-Hinomon&quot; (玉陵の碑文 &quot;Inscription of Tamaudun tomb&quot;) (1501), for example. Within the Ryukyu Kingdom, official texts were written in kanji and hiragana, derived from Japan. However, this was a sharp contrast from Japan at the time, where classical Chinese writing was mostly used for official texts, only using hiragana for informal ones. Classical Chinese writing was sometimes used in Ryukyu as well, read in &quot;kundoku&quot; (Ryukyuan) or in Chinese. In Ryukyu, katakana was hardly used.

Historically, official documents in Ryukyuan were primarily written in a form of classical Chinese writing known as Kanbun, while poetry and songs were often written in the Shuri dialect of Okinawan.

Commoners did not learn kanji. &quot;Omoro Sōshi&quot; (1531–1623), a noted Ryukyuan song collection, was mainly written in hiragana. Other than hiragana, they also used Suzhou numerals (&quot;sūchūma&quot; すうちゅうま in Okinawan), derived from China. In Yonaguni in particular, there was a different writing system, the Kaidā glyphs (カイダー字 or カイダーディー). Under Japanese influence, all of those numerals became obsolete.

Nowadays, perceived as &quot;dialects&quot;, Ryukyuan languages are not often written. When they are, Japanese characters are used in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; manner. There are no standard orthographies for the modern languages. Sounds not distinguished in the Japanese writing system, such as glottal stops, are not properly written. Sometimes local &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; are given to kanji, such as &quot;agari&quot; (あがり &quot;east&quot;) for 東, &quot;iri&quot; (いり &quot;west&quot;) for 西, thus 西表 is Iriomote.

Okinawa Prefectural government set up in 2018, and the commission proposed an unified spelling rule based on katakana for languages of Kunigami, Okinawa, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni on May 30 in 2022.

== Literature ==

=== &quot;Omoro Sōshi&quot; ===
A compilation of ancient poems and songs from Okinawa and the Amami Islands, collected into 22 volumes and written primarily in hiragana with some simple kanji.　The &quot;Omoro Sōshi&quot; was first compiled in 1531.

More than 80% of the words used in Omoro are common with the Yamato language and were used in the Muromachi period. This usage of language Indicates that the people who carried Omoro peoms were those who migrated south from Yamato to Okinawa in the late Heian to Muromachi periods.

==Phonology==
Ryukyuan languages often share many phonological features with Japanese, including a voicing opposition for obstruents, CV(C) syllable structure, moraic rhythm, and pitch accent. However, many individual Ryukyuan languages diverge significantly from this pan-Japonic base. For instance, Ōgami does not have phonemic voicing in obstruents, allows CCVC syllables, and has unusual syllabic consonants such as &quot;make&quot;.

===Consonants===
The Northern Ryukyuan (Amami-Okinawa) languages are notable for having glottalic consonants. Phonemically these are analyzed of consisting of a cluster + C, where the consonant consists of its own mora. For instance, in the Amami dialect Yuwan the word &quot;horse&quot; is bimoraic. Tsuken (Central Okinawan) restricts glottalization to glides and the vowels . Southern Ryukyuan mostly has little to no glottalization, with some exceptions (e.g. Yonaguni). For instance, the Irabu dialect of the Miyako language only allows glottalization with and : &quot;then&quot;, &quot;pipe&quot;.

Southern Ryukyuan stands out in having a number of syllabic consonants. These consonants are contextually nucleic, becoming syllabic when not adjacent to a vowel. Examples:

Irabu Miyako:
* &quot;wave&quot;
* &quot;shell&quot;
* &quot;potato&quot;
* &quot;man&quot;
* &quot;daytime&quot;
Ōgami Miyako
* &quot;cow&quot;
* &quot;dust&quot;
* &quot;breast&quot;

Ōgami even shows a three-way length distinction in fricatives, though across a syllable boundary:
* &quot;child&quot;
* &quot;grass&quot;
* &quot;comb&quot;, &quot;top&quot;

Ikema (a Miyako dialect) has a voiceless moraic nasal phoneme , which always precedes another nasal onset and assimilates its place of articulation to the following nasal.

===Vowels===
Amami has high and mid central vowels. Yonaguni only has three contrasting vowels, , and .

===Suprasegmentals===
The Ryukyuan languages operate based on the mora. Most Ryukyuan languages require words to be at least bimoraic, thus for example in Hateruma the underlying noun root &quot;hand&quot; becomes when it is an independent noun, though it remains as when attached to a clitic, e.g. . However, the syllable may still sometimes be relevant—for instance, the Ōgami topic marker takes a different form after open syllables with short vowels:
* &quot;staff&quot; → 
* &quot;vegetable&quot; → 
* &quot;person&quot; → 

Ryukyuan languages typically have a pitch accent system where some mora in a word bears the pitch accent. They commonly either have two or three distinctive types of pitch accent which may be applied. The category of foot also has relevance to the accentual systems of some Ryukyuan languages, and some Miyako varieties have a cross-linguistically rare system of tonal foot. However, Irabu Miyakoan does not have lexical accent.

==Grammar==

===Morphology===

The Ryukyuan languages consistently distinguish between the word classes of nouns and verbs, distinguished by the fact that verbs take inflectional morphology. Property-concept (adjectival) words are generally bound morphemes. One strategy they use is compounding with a free-standing noun:

Compounding is found in both Northern and Southern Ryukyuan, but is mostly absent from Hateruma (Yaeyama).

Another way property stems are used is by verbalization:

Miyako is unique in having stand-alone adjectives. These may be formed by reduplication of the root, e.g. Irabu Miyako &quot;imi-&quot; &quot;small&quot; → &quot;imii-imi&quot; &quot;small (adj.)&quot;. They may also be compounded with a grammaticalized noun &quot;munu&quot; &quot;thing&quot;, e.g. Irabu &quot;imi-munu&quot; &#x27;small (thing)&#x27;.

===Syntax===
Ryukyuan languages are generally SOV, dependent-marking, modifier-head, nominative-accusative languages. They are also pro-drop languages. All of these features are shared with the Japanese language.

In many Ryukyuan languages, the nominative and genitive are marked identically, a system also found, for example, in Austronesian languages. However, Ryukyuan has the unusual feature that these markers vary based on an animacy hierarchy. Typically there are two markers of the form &quot;=ga&quot; and &quot;=nu&quot;, which are distinguished based on animacy and definiteness. In Yuwan Amami, for instance, the nominative is marked with &quot;=ga&quot;/&quot;=nu&quot; and the genitive by &quot;=ga&quot;/&quot;=nu&quot;/&quot;=Ø&quot; based on the following hierarchy:


In the Miyako varieties, the object in a dependent clause of clause-chaining constructions has a special marker, homophonous to a topic marker. This might even be interpreted as another function of the topic marker.

Hateruma Yaeyama stands out in that it is a zero-marking language, where word order rather than case marking is important:

The Ryukyuan languages mark both topic and focus grammatically. The typical form of the topic marker is =, or in Southern Ryukyuan &quot;=ba&quot;; the typical focus marker is &quot;=du&quot;. In some Ryukyuan languages there are many focus markers with different functions; for instance, Irabu has &quot;=du&quot; in declarative clauses, &quot;=ru&quot; in yes-no interrogative clauses, and &quot;=ga&quot; in wh-interrogative clauses. The focus markers trigger a special verbal inflection—this typologically unusual focus construction, known as &quot;kakari-musubi&quot;, was also found in Old Japanese, but has been lost in Modern Japanese.

Examples from Yuwan Amami:



While in many Japonic languages this special inflection is often identical to the verbal inflection in relative clauses, in Yuwan Amami is different (the relative inflection is &quot;-n/-tan&quot;). There is some variation among the Ryukyuan languages as to the form of kakari-musubi—for example, in Irabu Miyako a focus marker blocks a specific verb form, rather than triggering a special inflection.

==Vocabulary==
Thorpe (1983) reconstructs the following pronouns in Proto-Ryukyuan. For the first person, the singular and plural are assumed based on the Yonaguni reflex.
* *a, &#x27;I&#x27; (singular)
* *wa &#x27;we&#x27; (plural)
* *u, *e &#x27;you&#x27; (singular)
* *uya, *ura &#x27;you&#x27; (plural)

Pellard (2015) reconstructs the following cultural vocabulary words for Proto-Ryukyuan.

<text>Fred Lawrence Whipple (November 5, 1906 – August 30, 2004) was an American astronomer, who worked at the Harvard College Observatory for more than 70 years. Among his achievements were asteroid and comet discoveries, the &quot;dirty snowball&quot; hypothesis of comets, and the invention of the Whipple shield.

== Life ==
Whipple was born on November 5, 1906, in Red Oak, Iowa, as the son of a farmer. An early bout with polio ended his ambition of being a professional tennis player. Whipple studied at Occidental College in Southern California, then majored in mathematics at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating in 1927. Recollecting his path from mathematics to astronomy, Whipple stated in a 1978 autobiography that his &quot;mathematics major veered [him] through physics and finally focused on astronomy where time, space, mathematics, and physics had a common meeting ground.&quot;

After taking a class in astronomy, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley where he obtained his PhD in Astronomy in 1931. While in graduate school, he helped map the orbit of the then newly discovered dwarf planet Pluto. He joined Harvard College Observatory in 1931 and studied the trajectories of meteors, confirming that they originated within the Solar System rather than from interstellar space. In 1933, he discovered the periodic comet 36P/Whipple and the asteroid 1252 Celestia. He also discovered or co-discovered five other non-periodic comets, the first of which was C/1932 P1 Peltier-Whipple, independently discovered by the famed amateur astronomer Leslie Peltier, while his last, and brighter, was C/1942 X1 (Whipple–Fedtke–Tevzadze).

During World War II, he invented a device for cutting tinfoil into chaff, a radar countermeasure. He was awarded a Certificate of Merit for this in 1948. He also invented a &quot;meteoroid bumper&quot; or &quot;Whipple shield&quot;, which protects spacecraft from impact by small particles by breaking them up.

From 1950 until 1977 he was a professor of Astronomy at Harvard University, including being the Phillips Professor of Astronomy between 1968 and 1977. During these years (in the early 1950s), he wrote a series of influential papers entitled &quot;A Comet Model&quot;, published in &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;. In these papers, he proposed the &quot;icy conglomerate&quot; hypothesis of comet composition (later called the &quot;dirty snowball&quot; hypothesis). The basic features of this hypothesis were later confirmed; however, the exact amount (and thus the importance) of ices in a comet is an active field of research, with most of the recently obtained data pointing to a low contribution of ices to a comet&#x27;s mass (dubbed the &quot;icy dirtball&quot; hypothesis). He also anticipated the era of artificial satellites and organized the members of Operation Moonwatch to track them. These groups were the only ones in the US prepared and ready to make observations when the Soviet Union unexpectedly launched Sputnik I in 1957. He became director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory when Loyal Blaine Aldrich retired in 1955, and remained in this post until 1973.

Whipple made at least one media appearance, in the science documentary film &quot;Target...Earth?&quot; (1980). He also appeared in the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Giotto encounter with Halley&#x27;s Comet, in 1986.

Whipple died in 2004, aged 97.

<text>The Okanogan–Wenatchee National Forest is a U.S. National Forest located in Okanogan County in north-central Washington, United States.

The forest is bordered on the north by British Columbia, on the east by Colville National Forest, on the south by the divide between the Methow and the Stehekin–Lake Chelan valleys, and on the west by North Cascades National Park. The closest significant communities are Omak and Okanogan.

Managed by the United States Forest Service, its headquarters are in Wenatchee. It is the second-largest national forest (after the Nez Perce National Forest in Idaho) that is contained entirely within one county and largest of which in Washington.

Most of the Pasayten Wilderness (excluding its westernmost part, which lies in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest), and the northeast portion (about 63%) of Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness are part of the forest, with the balance lying in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.

The western part of the forest is wetter than the dry and less temperate east. The vegetation varies similarly, from the western boreal forest, to the eastern high-elevation steppe. A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the forest was , a majority of which was lodgepole pine forests. Wildfires are not uncommon in the Okanogan National Forest. Notable fires include the 2006 Tripod Complex, the 2014 Carlton Complex and the 2015 Okanogan Complex fires.

The Okanogan National Forest was established on July 1, 1911, from a portion of the Chelan National Forest. On July 1, 1921, the entire forest was transferred back to the Chelan National Forest, but on March 23, 1955, the transfer was reverted.

The Wenatchee National Forest has an area of 1,735,394 acres (2,711.55 sq mi, or 7,022.89 km2); it extends about 137 miles along the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range of Washington, USA from Okanogan National Forest to Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The forest is located in Chelan, Kittitas and Yakima counties.

==Wilderness areas==
There are six officially designated wilderness areas within Wenatchee National Forest that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. All of them lie partially in neighboring National Forests (as indicated).
* Alpine Lakes Wilderness (partly in Snoqualmie NF)
* Glacier Peak Wilderness (partly in Mount Baker NF)
* Goat Rocks Wilderness (mostly in Gifford Pinchot NF)
* Henry M. Jackson Wilderness (partly in Snoqualmie NF (46.2%); Mount Baker NF (27.2%))
* Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness (mostly in Okanogan NF)
* William O. Douglas Wilderness (partly in Gifford Pinchot NF)

=== Waptus Lake ===
Nearly two miles long and accessible only by hiking or horse trails, Waptus Lake is the largest Alpine lake in the National Forest. Drained by the Waptus River, it is notable for its views of Summit Chief and Bears Breast mountains.

==Ecology==
A 1993 United States Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the Forest was . Wildfires are not uncommon in the National Forest. In September 2012, a severe lightning storm ignited hundreds of fires, the largest of which were located southwest of the city of Wenatchee and east of Blewett Pass. Significant wildfires occurred again in July 2014, in the Chiwaukum and Entiat Mountains. A lightning strike near Jolly Mountain on August 11, 2017, ultimately burned more than 38,000 acres and forced significant evacuations.

==Administration==
The Okanogan National Forest was administratively combined with the Wenatchee National Forest in 2000, although the boundaries for each forest remained unchanged, and in 2007, it administratively became known as the Okanogan–Wenatchee National Forest. The headquarters are in Wenatchee, Washington.

Administration is divided across 6 Ranger districts:

* Chelan Ranger District (Headquarters: Chelan, WA)
* Cle Elum Ranger District (Headquarters: Cle Elum, WA)
* Entiat Ranger District (Headquarters: Entiat, WA)
* Methow Valley Ranger District (Headquarters: Winthrop, WA)
* Natches Ranger District (Headquarters: Naches, WA)
* Wenatchee River Ranger District (Headquarters: Leavenworth, WA)

== History ==

The Forest Reserve Act of 1891 gave the President the authority to establish forest reserves for the United States Department of the Interior. After passage of the Transfer Act of 1905, forest reserves became part of the United States Department of Agriculture in the newly created United States Forest Service. The Chelan National Forest was established by the Forest Service on July 1, 1908, from from a portion of the Washington National Forest, and was named after the city of Chelan, where its headquarters were. The forest&#x27;s initial area of extended from the northern Okanogan River near the Canada–United States border to divide the Lake Chelan and Entiat watersheds to the southern Cascade Crest. On July 1, 1911, the forest partly transformed into Okanogan National Forest. However, Chelan National Forest was still existent, then only occupying the drainage basin of Lake Chelan and Entiat.

The Conconully, Loomis, Squaw Creek, Sweat Creek, Twisp and Winthrop ranger districts were formed between 1911 and 1915. On July 1, 1921, the entire forest reunited back into the Chelan National Forest, and the term &quot;Okanogan&quot; was discontinued. Subsequently, another ranger district was established, the Chelan Ranger District. Portions of the Loomis Ranger District, along with the Sweat Creek Ranger District, absorbed to become the Loomis State Forest, later abandoned. The forest&#x27;s ranger area underwent a number of smaller changes until the mid-1940s. The Squaw Creek Ranger District was absorbed by the Twisp Ranger District in the early 1930s, while the Forest Service Monument 83 lookout was constructed in neighboring British Columbia as an accident. The Pasayten Ranger District was later created from a portion of the Winthrop Ranger District, and the Conconully Ranger District became the Okanogan Ranger District. The western part of the Colville National Forest transferred into the Chelan National Forest in 1943. On March 23, 1955, Chelan National Forest again became the Okanogan National Forest, then headquartered in the city of Okanogan. As per the change, the rename of the Conconully Ranger District was reverted.

In 1968, the Pasayten Wilderness was established, introducing over to the forest. The United States Congress designated almost 65 percent of the forest&#x27;s area as the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System around 1984, upon land formerly occupied by the former Chelan Division of the Washington Forest Reserve.

The first forest supervisor of Wenatchee National Forest was Albert H. Sylvester, who named over a thousand natural features in the region.

On October 15, 2024 a U.S. Navy EA-18G Growler crashed east of Mt. Rainer, causing closures in the Pear Butte region of the Natches Ranger District from October 21 - December 31 as the military searched for debris relate to the incident.

<doc id="584406" wikidata="Q4391289" url="?curid=584406" title="Edge-transitive graph">
<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, an edge-transitive graph is a graph such that, given any two edges and of , there is an automorphism of that maps to .

In other words, a graph is edge-transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively on its edges.

==Examples and properties==
The number of connected simple edge-transitive graphs on n vertices is 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 8, 9, 13, 7, 19, 10, 16, 25, 26, 12, 28 ... 

Edge-transitive graphs include all symmetric graphs, such as the vertices and edges of the cube. Symmetric graphs are also vertex-transitive (if they are connected), but in general edge-transitive graphs need not be vertex-transitive. Every connected edge-transitive graph that is not vertex-transitive must be bipartite, (and hence can be colored with only two colors), and either semi-symmetric or biregular.

Examples of edge but not vertex transitive graphs include the complete bipartite graphs formula_1 where m ≠ n, which includes the star graphs formula_2. For graphs on n vertices, there are (n-1)/2 such graphs for odd n and (n-2) for even n.
Additional edge transitive graphs which are not symmetric can be formed as subgraphs of these complete bi-partite graphs in certain cases. Subgraphs of complete bipartite graphs Km,n exist when m and n share a factor greater than 2. When the greatest common factor is 2, subgraphs exist when 2n/m is even or if m=4 and n is an odd multiple of 6. So edge transitive subgraphs exist for K3,6, K4,6 and K5,10 but not K4,10. An alternative construction for some edge transitive graphs is to add vertices to the midpoints of edges of a symmetric graph with v vertices and e edges, creating a bipartite graph with e vertices of order 2, and v of order 2e/v.

An edge-transitive graph that is also regular, but still not vertex-transitive, is called semi-symmetric. The Gray graph, a cubic graph on 54 vertices, is an example of a regular graph which is edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive. The Folkman graph, a quartic graph on 20 vertices is the smallest such graph.

The vertex connectivity of an edge-transitive graph always equals its minimum degree.

<text>The BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award is presented at the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year award ceremony. It is awarded to the sportsperson aged 17 or under as of 1 January of that year, who has made the most outstanding contribution to sport in that year.

==Nomination procedure==
Nominees have to be British citizens or are residents who &quot;play a significant amount of their sport in the UK&quot; with their solo &quot;core achievements&quot; being undertaken in the UK.

As of 2024, nominations are put forward by a judging panel which includes representatives from the BBC, Youth Sport Trust, a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter, a young &quot;Blue Peter&quot; &quot;guest&quot; judge and sporting talent who then decide on a ten-person shortlist. The panel later reconvenes to choose the top three, and decides on the winner by secret ballot.

==History==
The BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award was preceded by the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Newcomer Award, in which the recipients could be aged up to 25. Decathlete Dean Macey was the inaugural winner of the Newcomer Award in 1999, and racing driver Jenson Button was the second and last winner the following year. In 2001, the award was replaced by the Young Sports Personality of the Year, and sprinter Amy Spencer was the first recipient of that award. The only person to win the award more than once is diver Tom Daley, who won the award three times, in 2007, 2009, and 2010. The most recent award was presented in 2024 to darts player Luke Littler.

<doc id="584416" wikidata="Q1751296" url="?curid=584416" title="Uterine contraction">
<text>Uterine contractions are muscle contractions of the uterine smooth muscle that can occur at various intensities in both the non-pregnant and pregnant uterine state. The non-pregnant uterus undergoes small, spontaneous contractions in addition to stronger, coordinated contractions during the menstrual cycle and orgasm. Throughout gestation, the uterus enters a state of uterine quiescence due to various neural and hormonal changes. During this state, the uterus undergoes little to no contractions, though spontaneous contractions still occur for the uterine myocyte cells to experience hypertrophy. The pregnant uterus only contracts strongly during orgasms, labour, and in the postpartum stage to return to its natural size.

==Throughout menstrual cycle==
Uterine contractions that occur throughout the menstrual cycle, also termed &quot;endometrial waves&quot; or &quot;contractile waves&quot;, appear to involve only the sub-endometrial layer of the myometrium.

===Follicular and luteal phase===
In the early follicular phase, uterine contractions in the non-pregnant woman occur 1–2 times per minute and last 10–15 seconds with a low intensity of usually 30 mmHg or less. This sub-endometrial layer is rich in estrogen and progesterone receptors. The frequency of contractions increases to 3–4 per minute towards ovulation. During the luteal phase, the frequency and intensity decrease, possibly to facilitate any implantation.

===Menstruation===
If implantation does not occur, the frequency of contractions remains low; but at menstruation the intensity increases dramatically to between 50 and 200 mmHg producing labor-like contractions. These contractions are sometimes termed &quot;menstrual cramps&quot;, although that term is also used for menstrual pain in general. These contractions may be uncomfortable or even painful, but they are generally significantly less painful than contractions during labour. Painful contractions are called dysmenorrhea.

===Directionality of contractions===
A shift in the myosin expression of the uterine smooth muscle has been hypothesized as arising for changes in the directions of uterine contractions during the menstrual cycle.

==Labour and pregnancy==
Uterine contractions are a vital part of natural childbirth, which occur during the process of labour and delivery, (typically this excludes caesarean section). These labour contractions are characterized by their rhythmic tightening and relaxation of the myometrium, the most prominent uterine muscle. Labour contractions primarily serve the purpose of opening and dilating the cervix, which leads to the assisting of the passage of the baby through the vaginal canal during the first stage of labour.

Throughout pregnancy, the uterus experiences motor denervation, thus inhibiting spontaneous contractions. The remaining contractions are predominantly hormonally controlled. The decrease in the coordination of uterine smooth muscles cells reduces the effectiveness of contractions, causing the uterus to enter a state of uterine quiescence. During the beginning of labour, contractions may initially be intermittent and irregular, but will transition into a more coordinated pattern as the labour progresses. This transition is governed by various myogenic, neurogenic, and hormonal factors working together. As labour progresses, contractions will typically increase in frequency and intensity, which leads to a significant rise in intrauterine pressure.

Otherwise, not all contractions experienced by pregnant individuals are indications of the beginning of labour. Some women experience what are commonly called Braxton Hicks contractions before their initial due date, which are characterized as “false labour.&quot; Though similar to labour uterine contractions, these contractions do not play a prominent role in cervical dilation or the progression of childbirth.

=== Oxytocin ===
The hormone oxytocin has been identified as inducing uterine contractions, and labour in general. Oxytocin is produced by the body naturally and since the 1950s has also been available in synthetic pharmaceutical form. In either form, oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions to accelerate the process of childbirth. Production and secretion of oxytocin is controlled by a positive feedback mechanism, where its initial release, either naturally or in pharmaceutical form, stimulates production and release of further oxytocin. For example, when oxytocin is released during a contraction of the uterus at the start of childbirth, this stimulates production and release of more oxytocin and an increase in the duration, intensity and frequency of contractions. This process compounds in intensity and frequency and continues until the triggering activity ceases.

=== Prostaglandins ===
The concentration of prostaglandins in the blood plasma and amniotic fluid increases during labor. These inflammatory mediators encourage myometrial contractions to induce labor. Prostaglandins are also related to the changes in gap junction formation and connexin-43 expression during labor.

==In orgasm==
Uterine and vaginal contractions usually take place during female sexual stimulation, including sexual arousal, and orgasm.

== Monitors ==
Uterine contractions can be monitored by cardiotocography, in which a device is affixed to the skin of the mother or directly to the fetal scalp. The pressure required to flatten a section of the uterine wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of it.

A type of monitoring technology under development at Drexel University embeds conductive threads in the knitted fabric of a bellyband. When the fibers stretch in response to a contraction, the threads function like an antenna, and send the signals they pick up to an embedded RFID (radio-frequency identification device) chip that reports the data.

==Mechanism==
===Resting state===
The resting membrane potential (Vrest) of uterine smooth muscle has been recorded to be between −35 and −80 mV. As with the resting membrane potential of other cell types, it is maintained by a Na+/K+ pump that causes a higher concentration of Na+ ions in the extracellular space than in the intracellular space, and a higher concentration of K+ ions in the intracellular space than in the extracellular space. Subsequently, having K+ channels open to a higher degree than Na+ channels results in an overall efflux of positive ions, resulting in a negative potential.

This resting potential undergoes rhythmic oscillations, which have been termed &quot;slow waves&quot;, and reflect intrinsic activity of slow wave potentials. These slow waves are caused by changes in the distribution of Ca2+, Na+, K+ and Cl− ions between the intracellular and extracellular spaces, which, in turn, reflects the permeability of the plasma membrane to each of those ions. K+ is the major ion responsible for such changes in ion flux, reflecting changes in various K+ channels.

===Excitation-contraction===
As the uterus becomes essentially denervated during gestation, it is unlikely that any coordinated nervous regulation of the myometrium is centrally orchestrated.

====Excitation====
The excitation-contraction coupling of the uterine smooth muscle is also very similar to that of other smooth muscles in general, with intracellular increase in calcium (Ca2+) leading to contraction.

Nitric oxide (NO) is particularly effective in relaxing the myometrium and in fact has a lower inhibitory concentration 50% (Ki) in human than guinea pig or non-human primate myometrium.

===Restoration to resting state===
Uterine smooth muscle mechanisms of relaxation differ significantly from those of other human smooth muscles. Removal of Ca2+ after contraction induces relaxation of the smooth muscle, and restores the molecular structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum for the next contractile stimulus.

== Measuring uterine contractility &quot;ex vivo&quot; ==
Ethically donated human uterine tissues can be used to measure uterine contractility &quot;ex vivo&quot;. In these experiments, sections of myometrium are set up in an organ bath system that to measure changes in isometric force production. Following functional checks to ensure the tissue is physiologically active, compounds can be added to the organ bath in increasing concentrations to create a cumulative concentration-response curve (CCRC).

A key advantage of measuring uterine contractility &quot;ex vivo&quot; is the ability to eliminate species differences. For example, while magnesium reduces myometrial contractility in animal studies and &quot;in vitro&quot;, it does not demonstrate the same effect in clinical studies. And while the peptide hormone relaxin has been shown to inhibit uterine contractility in rats, mice, and pigs, it does not prevent uterine contractility in humans.

<text>The Mendocino National Forest is located in the Coastal Mountain Range in northwestern California and comprises . It is the only national forest in the state of California without a major paved road entering it.
There are a variety of recreational opportunities — camping, hiking, mountain biking, paragliding, backpacking, boating, fishing, hunting, nature study, photography, and off-highway vehicle travel.

The forest lies in parts of six counties. In descending order of forestland area they are Lake, Glenn, Mendocino, Tehama, Trinity, and Colusa counties. Forest headquarters are located in Willows, California. There are local ranger district offices in Covelo, Upper Lake, and Stonyford.

== Wilderness areas ==

The forest includes four wilderness areas:
* Sanhedrin Wilderness - 
* Snow Mountain Wilderness — 
* Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness — (partly in Trinity NF, Six Rivers NF, or on BLM land)
* Yuki Wilderness - (partly on BLM land)

The Sanhedrin and Yuki wildernesses were signed into law on October 17, 2006. This legislation, entitled &quot;Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act&quot;, added areas to both the Yolla Bolly - Middle Eel Wilderness and Snow Mountain Wilderness, and established the two new wilderness areas in the Mendocino National Forest.

== Rivers, lakes, and hot springs ==
Rivers include: Eel River, Rice Fork Eel River, Middle Fork Eel River, Black Butte River, and Stony Creek (Sacramento River).

Lake Pillsbury is the largest recreational lake in the forest at and offers boat ramps, camping and resorts.
Letts Lake, southeast of Lake Pillsbury is in size and has hiking trails, campgrounds and is close to trailheads into Snow Mountain Wilderness.

Other lakes include Plaskett Lakes in the middle of the forest, Howard, Hammerhorn, Square and Long Lakes near Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness in the northern portion.

== History ==
In 1905 the first surveys of public domain lands were conducted by Professor Lachie of the University of California, Berkeley, working under the direction of Gifford Pinchot, Chief of the United States Forest Service, to determine what land should be included in a forest reserve.
In 1905 the U.S. Congress moved the reserves from the General Land Office in the Department of the Interior to the new Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. The Division of Forestry became the U.S. Forest Service.

President Theodore Roosevelt set aside the reserve (as authorized by the Forest Reserve Act of 1891) on February 6, 1907, as the Stony Creek Forest Reserve and one month later, the reserve was added to the national forest system as the Stony Creek National Forest.
Because of the difficulty of managing such a large tract of land, the northern portion was reassigned to Trinity National Forest, then the final boundaries of the new Stony Creek forest were drawn and was signed into law by executive order of the president on July 2, 1908, and renamed the California National Forest.

===Yet another name===

&quot;In order to avoid the confusion growing out of the state and a national forest therein having the same name&quot; President Herbert Hoover signed executive order 5885 renaming California National Forest to Mendocino National Forest on July 12, 1932.

The development of the forest increased to 81 offices, lookouts and guard stations until improvements in transportation and communications allowed some offices to be closed.
Today there are three ranger districts, with some of the former guard stations now being utilized as &quot;work centers&quot; that are primarily staffed by fire crews.
Two areas managed by the Mendocino National Forest are outside the contiguous boundaries and they are the Genetic Research Center in Chico, California, and the Lake Red Bluff Recreation Area in central California.

===Genetic Research Center===

Acquired by the Forest Service in 1974, it was originally a plant breeding research and plant introduction facility that was started in 1904 on a site under the Agriculture Research Service. The center&#x27;s research gradually changed to developing and producing genetically improved plant material for the reforestation program of the Pacific Southwest Region. Major work is done in the areas of biological, chemical, and clinical research on anti-cancer drugs derived

== Wildfires ==
The infamous Rattlesnake Fire occurred here in 1953. One Forest Service employee and 14 volunteer firefighters perished. The circumstances of the tragedy resulted in major changes in firefighting strategy and training. The firefighters are memorialized at the Rattlesnake Fire Memorial overlooking Rattlesnake Canyon. Access to it can be found off of Forest Highway 7 on County Road 307/Alder Springs Road.

The Trough Fire burned almost of the Mendocino National Forest in 2001 including land in the Snow Mountain Wilderness.

Between late July and early September 2018, the Mendocino Complex Fire burned approximately in the southern portion of the forest, or around one-third of the forest&#x27;s total area. One firefighter was killed by falling debris near Lake Pillsbury on August 13. The burned area included the entire Snow Mountain Wilderness.

Originating as 38 separate fires started by lightning on August 16 and 17, 2020, the August Complex Fire became the largest wildfire in California history. The fire was primarily burning through the Mendocino National Forest, and grew to over 1,026,000 acres.

==Wildlife==

The tule elk is one of the largest land mammals native to California, with cows weighing up to 350 pounds, and the largest bulls weighing roughly 500 pounds. Hunted to near extinction during the state&#x27;s gold rush era, the animals were reintroduced to the Lake Pillsbury Basin in the late 1970s by the California Department of Fish and Game, and the herd has steadily grown, numbering around 80 in 2007.

The elk live on the north shore of the lake at the bottom of Hull Mountain, and enjoy wild clovers and grasses, along with the green summer and fall foliage around Lake Pillsbury&#x27;s edges. Mendocino National Forest and Los Padres National Forest are the only two national forests in California to have tule elk. There is a 10-day hunting season beginning on the second Wednesday in September each year.

==Vegetation==
An estimated of old growth occur here, including forests of Coast Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii&quot;), Ponderosa Pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;), White Fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot;), Tanoak (&quot;Lithocarpus densiflorus&quot;), and Pacific madrone (&quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot;).

<doc id="584419" wikidata="Q2474228" url="?curid=584419" title="Gentle on My Mind">
<text>&quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; is a song that was written and originally recorded by John Hartford, and released on his second studio album, &quot;Earthwords &amp; Music&quot; (1967). Hartford wrote the song after watching &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; in 1966, as he was inspired by the film and his own personal experiences. The lyrics describe the reminiscences of lost love of a man as he travels through the country. An obituary for Hartford indicated that the lyrics are &quot;about a hobo reminiscing about a lost love&quot;. The following year, Hartford released the song as a single on RCA Records. 

It then caught the attention of Glen Campbell, who recorded his version with a group of session musicians known as the Wrecking Crew, of which he had been a part. Campbell&#x27;s recording of &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; peaked in the top 30 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Country Singles chart. In 1968, between Campbell&#x27;s and Hartford&#x27;s recordings, the song earned four Grammy Awards. 

&quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; was later recorded by other singers, including Dean Martin, Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams and Elvis Presley. It was also translated into other languages. In 2014, a recording of the song by the Band Perry earned a Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance. Taking into account all recorded versions of the song, it has become the second-most-played song on the radio in the United States according to BMI.

==Writing and original recording==
In 1966, John Hartford was living with his wife and son in a trailer in Nashville, Tennessee. One night, the couple saw the film &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; at a local theater. Inspired by the love story depicted in the film between Yuri Zhivago and Lara Antipova, Hartford returned home and wrote &quot;Gentle on my Mind&quot; in between twenty and thirty minutes. The story of the song narrates the reminiscences of a drifter of his lost love, while moving through backroads and hobo encampments. Betty Hartford, who later divorced her husband, noted to him the similarity between herself and the song&#x27;s female character. She questioned John Hartford about the man&#x27;s regret for his marriage. Hartford said he likened her to Lara and attributed the man&#x27;s feelings about being trapped in a relationship to his &quot;artistic license&quot;.

Hartford defined the finished song as a &quot;word movie&quot; and described his writing process as &quot;thinking in pictures, like paintings using words and sound&quot;. In a 1980 interview, Hartford commented he was still unsure of the song&#x27;s meaning and that its message will be interpreted differently by listeners. Twelve years later, Hartford again attributed his inspiration to start writing the song to &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, and said the content was a result of his personal experience. Hartford said the song &quot;just came real fast, a blaze, a blur&quot;. He described the song as a banjo tune without a chorus, and with a variety of words he deemed &quot;hard to sing&quot; because it &quot;violated the principles of songwriting&quot;.

At the time, Hartford worked as a disc jockey on the radio station WSIX and for the publishing company Tompall &amp; the Glaser Brothers. Hartford recorded a demo and delivered it to Chuck Glaser, who took the demo to Chet Atkins of RCA Records. According to Harford, after writing &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;, he did not intend to record the song himself. Hartford sent the demos of &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; and a second song to sell them, but instead the label decided to offer Hartford a recording contract. Atkins then suggested to the songwriter to use &quot;Hartford&quot; instead of his surname &quot;Harford&quot; as a professional name. Hartford recorded &quot;Gentle on my Mind&quot; and its flipside &quot;Washing Machine&quot;, both of which were produced by Felton Jarvis. The single was released in May 1967. RCA, however, decided not to promote Hartford&#x27;s recording because they did not consider it to be a country song. &quot;Cashbox&quot; listed the single under their &quot;Best Bets&quot;; the magazine forecasted in a review that Hartford could get &quot;heaps of spins&quot; with his &quot;poetic folk-country-flavored ballad&quot;. &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; peaked at number 60 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Country Songs.

==Glen Campbell&#x27;s recording and success==
Hartford&#x27;s recording of &quot;Gentle on my Mind&quot; attracted Glen Campbell&#x27;s attention after he heard it on the radio and bought the single. He felt the song is &quot;an essay on life&quot; and was &quot;knocked out&quot; by the scenery it describes. At the time, Campbell worked as a studio musician with The Wrecking Crew; he rearranged the song and with the band, he recorded a demo at Capitol Studios. Campbell left the demo tape at the studio for producer Al De Lory, who made slight production arrangements that Capitol Records accepted as a master for the single. Campbell&#x27;s recording of &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; was released with &quot;Just Another Man&quot; on the B-side in June 1967. Upon its release, &quot;Billboard&quot; predicted the single would reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It peaked at number 30 on the magazine&#x27;s Hot Country Songs, and at number 62 on the Hot 100. The success of the song, which was originally intended for the country music market, helped Campbell cross over to the pop market.

After Campbell&#x27;s success with &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; was re-released in 1968. The new release of the single sold more copies than the original release, peaking at number 44 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Country Singles, at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and at number 8 on the Easy Listening chart. On the &quot;RPM&quot; charts in Canada, it peaked at number 20 on the country chart and at number 60 on the RPM 100. That year, &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; won the categories for Best Country &amp; Western Song, Best Folk Performance for Hartford&#x27;s recording; and Best Country &amp; Western Solo Vocal Performance, Male as well as Best Country &amp; Western Recording for Campbell&#x27;s version at the 10th Annual Grammy Awards.

By May 1968, an estimated fifty singers had recorded &quot;Gentle on my Mind&quot;, while Campbell&#x27;s recording had sold 600,000 copies. The song was recorded by such singers as Tammy Wynette (1968), Frank Sinatra (1968), Patti Page (1968), Waylon Jennings (1968), Dean Martin (1969), Aretha Franklin (1969), and Elvis Presley (1969). Page&#x27;s version reached number 7 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Easy Listening Chart and number 66 on the Hot 100. Franklin&#x27;s version was released as the B-side to her single &quot;I Can&#x27;t See Myself Leaving You&quot;; her version peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues Singles chart. Dean Martin&#x27;s version reached number 2 on the UK Singles chart, number 3 on the Irish Singles chart, and number 9 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Easy Listening chart. Hartford&#x27;s producer on the original recording of &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;, Felton Jarvis, co-produced Presley&#x27;s album &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot; (1969) with Chips Moman. The recording of Hartford&#x27;s song was the last number of Presley&#x27;s January 14, 1969, session. Following its second take, Presley experienced laryngitis and had to temporarily halt the recording.

The success of the song drew some opposition to its themes. Columnist and Catholic clergyman Jerome LeDoux said that the song&#x27;s &quot;catchy, simple melody combines with nice-sounding, immoral lyrics which no one really pays attention to, and which is therefore passed off as something decent&quot;.

==Legacy==
Hartford said the success of &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; allowed him to become a full-time songwriter without working as a disc jockey. The song&#x27;s success also caught the attention of Tom Smothers, who in 1968 invited Hartford to become a part of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; on CBS. The same year, Campbell performed &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; as the theme song of his own CBS show &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;.

In 1970, Claude François recorded the song in French under the title &quot;Si Douce A Mon Souvenir&quot;. Fourteen years later, Brazilian singer Roberto Carlos wrote the song &quot;Caminhoneiro&quot; (&quot;Trucker&quot;) in Portuguese using the melody of &quot;Gentle on My Mind.&quot; In 1985, Puerto Rican salsa singer Frankie Ruiz released a Spanish-language version of &quot;Caminhoneiro&quot; entitled &quot;El Camionero&quot;.

Hartford donated the manuscript of &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in 1982. By 1984, the song had played on radio over four million times in the United States, and became the best-selling song of Broadcast Music, Inc.&#x27;s (BMI) catalog. In 1987, the estimated number of plays grew to 4.4 million and 400 versions had been recorded. At the time, Hartford refused the use of the song for commercials and parodies. 

In 1990, BMI listed Campbell&#x27;s version of &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; as the fourth-most-played song in the history of radio in the US. It appeared at number 71 on &quot;Country America&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1992 list of the Top 100 Country Songs of All Time, while BMI placed the version at number 16 on its 1999 list of Top 100 Songs of the Century. By 2001, with six million plays, the song became the second-most-played on the radio in the US, behind the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yesterday&quot;.

In 2008, the 1967 recording of &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; by Glen Campbell on Capitol Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2014, the Band Perry recorded a version of the song for the documentary &quot;Glen Campbell: I&#x27;ll Be Me&quot;; the cover won the category for Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in 2015, and peaked at number 29 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Country Airplay and at number 35 on the Hot Country Songs. In August 2017, following Campbell&#x27;s death, sales of his hit singles increased by 6,000%. The digital downloads figure for &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot; registered 3,000 and increased the track&#x27;s total sales at the time to 251,000.

<doc id="584423" wikidata="Q3046150" url="?curid=584423" title="Excitebike 64">
<text>is a racing video game developed by Left Field Productions and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was released on May 2, 2000 in North America, June 23 in Japan, and June 8, 2001, in Europe. It is the second installment in the &quot;Excite&quot; series, acting as a sequel to &quot;Excitebike&quot; on the NES, and is the first 3D game in the series. Many real-life dirt bike gear brands are extensively featured throughout the game, such as Bell Helmets, Alpinestars and No Fear.

The game received positive reviews from critics and was later re-released for Wii U via the Virtual Console in 2016 and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on August 30, 2023 but with the removal of every Fox Racing brand logo. A third game in the series, &quot;Excite Truck&quot;, was released in 2006 for the Wii.

==Gameplay==

Players can choose from one of six riders, each with their own pre-set handling attributes. Players control the bike by using either the control stick or D-pad. They can use the gamepad to accelerate, brake, slide and use turbo boost. As in the original, holding down gives the player more air on jumps, while holding up aims the front wheel forward to enable landing on slopes. The player can also tilt the bike to the side while in the air, to adjust the angle at which they hit the turns, and can sideswipe their opponents. Besides the tracks main course many of the levels have hidden shortcuts, that require the player to slow down and change direction, or use a speed boost for jumping over chasms, from hill to hill, over other vehicles and buildings, choosing to follow the original game in its &quot;extreme&quot; jumps and physics.
===Features===
The main game features a 20-track season mode. Completing races unlocks more tracks and features. There is a tutorial that teaches players how to play through the 17 different tracks. There are a variety of exhibitions and time trial modes that lets players do more activities other than the main game. A major feature is the track editor, where players can create their own fully functional track and save it into the game. The announcer, Limua, shouts out the tricks and crashes throughout the race. Also featured is an emulated version of the original &quot;Excitebike&quot; and a 3D remake of it with the same obstacles called &quot;Excite 3D&quot;. There are also several other mini games such as a &quot;Stunt Course&quot;, &quot;Hill Climb&quot;, a &quot;Soccer&quot; game with a giant human sized soccer ball, and an &quot;infinite, randomly generated&quot; &quot;Desert Track&quot; where the player needs to put out ten campfires by driving over them, which &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; called &quot;one of the coolest concepts ever&quot;. As bonus features to the game, cheat modes were introduced, requiring the player to press buttons in a certain order to unlock a hidden &quot;Cheats Menu&quot;. From there they could enter passwords that unlocked additional features, such as Invisible riders, Big heads, Debug mode, Midnight mode and even unlocking a picture of the programmers in the game&#x27;s credits.

==Development==
While in development some of the main features they concentrated on were the game&#x27;s sense of speed, the jumps and the ability to perform tricks, similar to the original game, as well as taking inspiration from the earlier released &quot;Wave Race 64&quot;. To recreate the riders&#x27; movements and tricks the developers used a technique called &#x27;inverse kinematics&#x27; to create a life like feel. While other parts of the tracks were littered with bumps, log bridges and streams to run through. Using the N64&#x27;s Rumble Pak allowed the player to feel these game experiences, as well as such things as making a hard landing. Besides the standard tracks, several mini games were also added as unlockable content. The &quot;Desert Track&quot; was fractally generated for an endless desert, but despite the random building of its dunes, it also keeps the current configuration in the game&#x27;s memory, allowing the player to return to the same spot that they once left. The game was revealed by Nintendo to the public at the pre-E3 conference on May 12, 1999. The game was shown playable the next day.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, just two points shy of &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 29 out of 40.

&quot;N64 Magazine&quot; mentioned the low quality of other similar games released around the same time and said: &quot;After the lackluster efforts of &quot;Jeremy McGrath&quot; and &quot;Supercross 2000&quot;, we now have an intelligent racer.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; commended the game for its &quot;fantastic 3D engine, delightfully realistic physics, intuitive control, brilliantly detailed graphics, ingenious subtleties and tons of options&quot;. Levi Buchanan of &quot;GameFan&quot; stated: &quot;In addition to the superb animation, the game sounds awesome... Its dirt bikes actually sound like the real thing--none of that high-pitched tin squeal you&#x27;ll find in other sub-par racers.&quot; Michael Wolf of &quot;NextGen&quot; said, &quot;With all the secrets and special tracks, not to mention the realistic physics that&#x27;ll make you wince during crashes, this is one motocross racing game that will entertain for hours on end.&quot; The Freshman of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the game in one review, &quot;It could have been so much more, but &quot;Excitebike 64&quot; manages to be only the latest motocross game whose reoccurring bugs mar an otherwise excellent racing game. Various unlocked extras make &quot;Excitebike 64&quot; a truckload of fun, but it&#x27;s playing to get those goodies that kicks up the dirt.&quot; In another &quot;GamePro&quot; review, Dan Elektro said, &quot;While you can&#x27;t help but feel that &quot;Excitebike 64&quot; is a few tweaks short of greatness, it&#x27;s still a quality, enjoyable ride.&quot;

While the game received high praise, certain publications voiced complaints. &quot;GameCritics&quot; said, &quot;The game isn&#x27;t perfect — I would have liked even more tracks to race on as well as a few more racers.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; opined, &quot;Some will cry about the frame rate, and some will wish the game featured real riders.&quot;

Another problem the game encountered was that it was one of the last games released for the N64 in Europe, having been released there over a year later than the Japan and U.S. releases. The delay was due to Nintendo&#x27;s struggle to keep up with the demand for the games &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. This led some to feel that it was released too late in the system&#x27;s life and if it &quot;had appeared earlier... it would have been a bigger hit&quot;.

Nonetheless, the game ultimately went on to sell approximately two million units, according to information provided by former employees of Left Field Productions.

The game was nominated for the &quot;N64 Game of the Year&quot; award at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s Blister Awards 2000, which went to &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;.

It is situated on the banks of Powai Lake, and is bound by the hills of Vikhroli Parksite to the south-east, Chandivali to the south-west, the L.B.S. Marg (old Mumbai-Agra road) to the north-east and the Sanjay Gandhi National Park to the north beyond the lake. The Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road, one of the city&#x27;s busiest thoroughfares linking the western and eastern suburbs, passes through Powai. The place also hosts thousands of devotees every year during the Ganesh Chaturthi festival for the &quot;visarjan&quot; processions.

The Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, established in 1958 and currently the second oldest campus of the Indian Institutes of Technology as well as the Indian Institute of Management Mumbai, established in 1963 are both located here, as is a campus of the Bombay Scottish School. Powai is also home to residential complexes of the Income Tax department, Customs and NTPC, as well as those of ex-servicemen.

Some of the Temples of Powai are Chinmaya Mission&#x27;s Jagadeshwara Shiva Temple, Sri Ayyappa Vishnu Temple at Hiranandani, Devi Vageshwari Mata Temple at Chandivali. Powai also hosts community birthday havan.

Powai is also Mumbai&#x27;s start-up hub, with young entrepreneurs like the hiranandanis. starting off from incubation cells set up by institutes like IIT Bombay from the tech industry and other sectors setting their bases there, causing the area to be referred to as India&#x27;s Powai Valley.

==Geography==
Powai is a part of the Mumbai Suburban District, located in the north-eastern region of what is today considered to be the modern Mumbai metropolis. Administratively, it is a part of the Kurla tehsil and much of the area falls within the boundaries of the S-ward, the largest ward in Mumbai. Powai is situated on the banks of its namesake lake and boasts of a recently revamped, landscaped garden with viewing decks, a children&#x27;s play area and synchronized fountains. The privately run Dr. L. H. Hiranandani Hospital, located within the Hiranandani residential complex, is the first superspeciality hospital in the area.

As a result of prolific construction activity in the last two decades, the area has one of the highest residential population densities in suburban Mumbai. The development in the region has, however had an adverse impact on the environment, with the area facing the ill-effects of excessive concretization, resulting in a shrinking number of open spaces, green cover and rising pollution levels.

===Lake===

Perhaps the best-known landmark of Powai is the Powai Lake, a 120-year-old lake that was originally used to supply water to the city of Mumbai, and is today used as an industrial sewage outlet. Another prominent landmark that most outsiders associate Powai with is the IIT Bombay, located to the east of the lake. The campus of the NITIE is located near the north bank of the lake, as is the Renaissance Hotel and Convention centre, part of the Marriott group of hotels, with its distinctive facade visible across the Powai lake. In the past, fishing and bird-watching were popular recreational activities that took place along the shores of the lake. Rare migration birds were known to visit the lake each year and the lake boasted a variety of fish species. Crocodiles have also been spotted alongside the lake. And However, rapid and uncontrolled growth of the region in recent years has had an adverse effect on the flora and fauna found in and around the lake. In its day, the lake used to be an idyllic picnic spot for people wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.

Meluha The Fern is a 5 star eco-friendly hotel located near the lake, with a restaurant and bar.
Powai has become a destination for food lovers with many chain of restaurants opening up in the area.

==History==

The name &quot;Powai&quot; originates from Padmavati, a Hindu deity to whom a temple was dedicated in the village existing on the contemporary space of the neighbourhood. In 1826, after the death of the previous owner of the estate, the area that is now Powai was leased to Parsi merchant Framji Kavasji. The water body at the center of the neighbourhood that is now known as Powai Lake was a result of initiatives by city authorities in the 1890s to increase urban water supply. In 1943, four years before India&#x27;s independence, the freedom fighter Chandrabhan Sharma &amp; Ram Nath Grover arrived in Mumbai and happened to lease and subsequently buy Powai Estate from Sir Yusuf, the then owner, for a paltry sum. At that time, Powai comprised five villages: Saki, Kopri, Tirandaz, Powai and Paspauli. In the late 1950s, a portion of Powai was given to the government to set up an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). The Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, personally visited the area and during a meeting, Chandrabhan Sharma was motivated by him to give the land free of cost for this purpose. Simultaneously, a young engineer from Denmark, Søren Kristian Toubro had obtained a major contract in Mumbai. As a result, vast tracts of land were leased to him by Mr. Sharma to set up what would become Larsen &amp; Toubro.

<text>Alt Camp () is a comarca (county) located in the region of Camp de Tarragona, in Catalonia, Spain. The capital is the city of Valls.

==Geography==
To the north of the county lies Conca de Barberà, to the northeast lies Anoia, to the east and southeast lie Alt Penedès and Baix Penedès, to the south lies Tarragonès and to the southwest and west lies Baix Camp. Alt Camp has an area of and the capital of the county is Valls.

The county is divided into two main topographical areas. The northeastern part is mountainous and is in the Catalan Pre-Coastal Range while the southwestern part is a lowland plain in the Catalan Coastal Depression. The lowland plains of Alt Camp are predominantly used for agriculture. In the valley of the River Gaia, cherries, vines, olives and almonds are grown, and on irrigated land, vegetables, hazelnuts and various fruit trees. The municipality of Bràfim in this valley has a small industrial area. The mountain slopes are covered in maquis, an evergreen Mediterranean scrub with bushes and small trees, including many aromatic shrubs. The olives and grapevines that used to grow on terraces there have been abandoned. Among the scrub there are patches of poplar, elm, white pine, Portuguese oak and holm oak. Frequent wildfires prevent the establishment of permanent forests.

== Municipalities ==
In 2014, 44,578 people lived in the county: 24,570 of them lived in Valls; 5,131 in Alcover; 2,344 in El Pla de Santa Maria; 1,670 in Vallmoll; 1,264 in Vila-rodona; 1,115 in Cabra del Camp and 1,083 in Puigpelat. The remaining 8,401 inhabitants lived in municipalities with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants.

<text>The Luxor ABC 800 series are office versions of the ABC 80 home computer. They featured an enhanced BASIC interpreter, a slightly faster clocked CPU and more memory: 32 kilobytes RAM and 32 KB ROM was now standard, the Z80 is clocked at (quarter the 12 MHz crystal). It featured 40×24 text mode with eight colors (ABC 800 C) or 80×24 text mode monochrome (ABC 800 M). They could also be extended with &quot;high&quot; resolution graphics (240×240 pixels at 2 ) using RAM as video memory.

== Models ==

=== ABC 800 ===
The ABC 800 came in a monochrome version with amber text on a brown background with an 80 character wide screen, and a color version with 40 characters. The main board is integrated with the keyboard, much like the Amiga 500. However, the ABC computer has a very sturdy metal chassis.

Storage is usually two 5.25&quot; floppy disk units in 160, 320 or 640 KB capacity. External hard disk systems became available later (primarily the ABC 850 with 10 MB). Model numbers &#x27;ABC 800 M&#x27; for monochrome and &#x27;ABC 800 C&#x27; for color.

Luxor advertising asked, &quot;Who needs IBM-compatibility?&quot; However, most computer buyers eventually considered it a requirement. A certain degree of compatibility between the ABC and IBM PC platforms could be achieved with the help of a program called &#x27;W ABC&#x27;.

The ABC 800 computer was also sold by Facit under the name Facit DTC.

=== ABC 802 ===

The ABC 802 is a compact version with 64 KB RAM where 32 KB is used as a RAM disk. The main board is integrated with a 9&quot; CRT screen and has improved graphics, though no high-resolution graphics. Luxor ABC 802 was a model with a small monochrome screen in yellow phosphor, intended for offices. Here with two 5.25 inch disk drives along the side of the display. The grey-brown color was common for all ABC 800 (and ABC 1600) products and was different from the beige ABC 80.

=== ABC 806 ===
The ABC 806 is a version with main board, screen (DA-15) and keyboard (DIN-7) as separate units. It has RAM where is used as a RAM disk, as well as more advanced 512×240×16 graphics.

==Performance==
In order to see how the ABC 800 would compare to other contemporary personal computers, in 1982, the Swedish magazine &quot;MikroDatorn&quot; used the Rugg/Feldman benchmarks of eight short BASIC programs (BM1 - BM8) defined by the American Kilobaud Magazine and routinely used by the British magazine Personal Computer World for testing new machines. 

The result was that ABC 800&#x27;s semi-compiling BASIC interpreter turned out to be faster than most other BASICs used in popular machines, especially when integer variables are used, the results for some well known computers were as follows (times in seconds):

 BM1 BM2 BM3 BM4 BM5 BM6 BM7 BM8
 ABC 800 (integer) &quot;not measured - see ABC 80 for approximate numbers&quot;
 ABC 800 (single precision) 0.9 1.8 6.0 5.9 6.3 11.6 19.6 29
 ABC 800 (double precision) 1.2 2.2 10.0 10.6 11.0 17.8 26.4 144
 IBM PC 1.5 5.2 12.1 12.6 13.6 23.5 37.4 35
 Apple III 1.7 7.2 13.5 14.5 16.0 27.0 42.5 75
 VIC-20 1.4 8.3 15.5 17.1 18.3 27.2 42.7 99
 ZX81 in &quot;fast mode&quot; 4.5 6.9 16.4 15.8 18.6 49.7 68.5 229

As seen from the table, the ABC 800 was approximately twice as fast as the IBM PC on floating point calculations, except for BM8 where it was only 20% faster. Using integer variables (only measured for the older ABC 80 in this test) the numbers would be approximately 2-3 times as low (i.e. speeds 2-3 times as high) as for the single precision results in the table.

<doc id="584436" wikidata="Q204999" url="?curid=584436" title="Edward Emerson Barnard">
<text>Edward Emerson Barnard (December 16, 1857 – February 6, 1923) was an American astronomer. He was commonly known as E. E. Barnard, and was recognized as a gifted observational astronomer. He is best known for his discovery of the high proper motion of Barnard&#x27;s Star in 1916, which is named in his honor.

==Early life==
Barnard was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on December 16, 1857, to Reuben Barnard and Elizabeth Jane Barnard (&quot;née&quot; Haywood), and had one brother. His father died three months before his birth, so he grew up in an impoverished family and did not receive much in the way of formal education. His first interest was in the field of photography, and he became a photographer&#x27;s assistant at the age of nine.

He later developed an interest in astronomy. In 1876 he purchased a refractor telescope, and in 1881 he discovered his first comet, but failed to announce his discovery. He found his second comet later the same year and a third in 1882.

While he was still working at a photography studio he was married to the British-born Rhoda Calvert in 1881. In the 1880s, Hulbert Harrington Warner offered per discovery of a new comet. Barnard discovered a total of five, and used the money to build a house for himself and his wife.

With his name being brought to the attention of amateur astronomers in Nashville, they collectively raised enough money to give Barnard a fellowship to Vanderbilt University. He never graduated from the school, but did receive the only honorary degree Vanderbilt has ever awarded. He joined the staff of the Lick Observatory in California in 1887, though he later clashed with the director, Edward S. Holden, over access to observing time on the larger instruments and other issues of research and management.

==Astronomical work==

Barnard observed the gegenschein in 1882, not aware of earlier papers by Theodor Brorsen and T. W. Backhouse. In 1889, he observed the moon Iapetus pass behind Saturn&#x27;s rings. As he watched Iapetus pass through the space between Saturn&#x27;s innermost rings and the planet itself, he saw a shadow pass over the moon. Although he did not realize it at the time, he had discovered proof of the &quot;spokes&quot; of Saturn, dark shadows running perpendicular to the circular paths of the rings. These spokes were doubted at first, but confirmed by the spacecraft &quot;Voyager 1&quot;.

In 1892, he made observations of a nova and was the first to notice the gaseous emissions, thus correctly deducing that it was a stellar explosion. The same year he also discovered Amalthea, the fifth moon of Jupiter. He was the first to discover a new moon of Jupiter since Galileo Galilei in 1609. This was the last satellite discovered by direct visual observation (rather than by examining photographic plates or other recorded images).

In 1895, he joined the University of Chicago as professor of astronomy. There he was able to use the telescope at Yerkes Observatory. Much of his work during this period was taking photographs of the Milky Way. Together with Max Wolf, he discovered that certain dark regions of the galaxy were actually clouds of gas and dust that obscured the more distant stars in the background. From 1905, his niece Mary R. Calvert worked as his assistant and computer.

The faint Barnard&#x27;s Star is named for Edward Barnard after he discovered in 1916 that it had a large proper motion relative to other stars. This is the second nearest star system to the Sun, second only to the Alpha Centauri system.

He was also a pioneering astrophotographer. His Barnard Catalogue lists a series of dark nebulae, known as Barnard objects, giving them numerical designations akin to the Messier catalog. They begin with and end with Barnard 370. He published his initial list in a 1919 paper published in the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;, titled &quot;On the Dark Markings of the Sky with a Catalogue of 182 such Objects&quot;.

He died on February 6, 1923, in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, and was buried in Nashville. After his death, many examples from his exceptional collection of astronomical photographs were published in 1927 as &quot;A Photographic Atlas of Selected Regions of the Milky Way&quot;, this work having been finished by Mary R. Calvert and Edwin B. Frost, then director of Yerkes Observatory.

===Comet discoveries===
Between 1881 and 1892, he discovered 15 comets, three of which were periodic, and co-discovered two others:
* C/1881 did not announce
* C/1881 S1
* C/1882 R2
* D/1884 O1 (Barnard 1)
* C/1885 N1
* C/1885 X2
* C/1886 T1 (Barnard–Hartwig)
* C/1887 B3
* C/1887 D1
* C/1887 J1
* C/1888 U1
* C/1888 R1
* C/1889 G1
* 177P/Barnard (P/1889 M1, P/2006 M3, Barnard 2)
* C/1891 F1 (Barnard–Denning)
* C/1891 T1
* D/1892 T1 (Barnard 3) – First comet to be discovered by photography; recovered in late 2008 as 206P/Barnard–Boattini

<doc id="584438" wikidata="Q617228" url="?curid=584438" title="Winner's curse">
<text>The winner&#x27;s curse is a phenomenon that may occur in common value auctions, where all bidders have the same (&quot;ex post&quot;) value for an item but receive different private (&quot;ex ante&quot;) signals about this value and wherein the winner is the bidder with the most optimistic evaluation of the asset and therefore will tend to overestimate and overpay. Accordingly, the winner will be &quot;cursed&quot; in one of two ways: either the winning bid will exceed the value of the auctioned asset making the winner worse off in absolute terms, or the value of the asset will be less than the bidder anticipated, so the bidder may garner a net gain but will be worse off than anticipated. However, an actual overpayment will generally occur only if the winner fails to account for the winner&#x27;s curse when bidding (an outcome that, according to the revenue equivalence theorem, need never occur).

The winner’s curse phenomenon was first addressed in 1971 by three Atlantic Richfield petroleum engineers who claimed that oil companies suffered unexpectedly low returns &quot;year after year&quot; in early Outer Continental Shelf oil lease auctions. Outer Continental Shelf auctions are common value auctions, where the value of the oil in the ground is essentially the same to all bidders.

==Explanation==
In a common value auction, the auctioned item is of roughly equal value to all bidders, but the bidders don&#x27;t know the item&#x27;s market value when they bid. Each player independently estimates the value of the item before bidding.

The winner of an auction is the bidder who submits the highest bid. Since the auctioned item is worth roughly the same to all bidders, they are distinguished only by their respective estimates of the market value. The winner, then, is the bidder making the highest estimate. If we assume that the &quot;average&quot; bid is accurate, then the highest bidder overestimates the item&#x27;s value. Thus, the auction&#x27;s winner is likely to overpay.

More formally, this result is obtained using conditional expectation. We are interested in a bidder&#x27;s expected value from the auction (the expected value of the item, minus the expected price) conditioned on the assumption that the bidder wins the auction. It turns out that for a bidder&#x27;s true estimate the expected value is negative, meaning that on average the winning bidder is overpaying.

Savvy bidders will avoid the winner&#x27;s curse by bid shading, or placing a bid that is below their ex ante estimation of the value of the item for sale—but equal to their ex post belief about the value of the item, given that they win the auction. The key point is that winning the auction is &quot;bad news&quot; about the value of the item for the winner. It means that he or she was the most optimistic and, if bidders are correct in their estimations on average, that too much was paid. Therefore savvy bidders revise their ex ante estimations downwards to take account of this effect.

The severity of the winner&#x27;s curse increases with the number of bidders. This is because the more bidders, the more likely it is that some of them have overestimated the auctioned item&#x27;s value. In technical terms, the winner&#x27;s expected estimate is the value of the &quot;nth&quot; order statistic, which increases as the number of bidders increases.

There is often confusion that the winner&#x27;s curse applies to the winners of all auctions. However, it is worth repeating here that for auctions with private value (i.e. when the item is desired independently of its value in the market), winner&#x27;s curse does not arise. Similarly, there may be occasions when the &quot;average&quot; bid is too low relative to exterior market conditions e.g. a dealer recognizing an antique or other collectible as highly saleable elsewhere when other bidders do not have the necessary expertise.

==Examples==
Since most auctions involve at least some amount of common value, and some degree of uncertainty about that common value, the winner&#x27;s curse is an important phenomenon.

In the 1950s, when the term &quot;winner&#x27;s curse&quot; was first coined, there was no accurate method to estimate the potential value of an offshore oil field. So if, for example, an oil field had an actual intrinsic value of $10 million, oil companies might guess its value to be anywhere from $5 million to $20 million. The company who wrongly estimated at $20 million and placed a bid at that level would win the auction, and later find that it was not worth as much.

Other auctions where the winner&#x27;s curse is significant:
*Spectrum auctions in which companies bid on licenses to use portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Here, the uncertainty would come from, for example, estimating the value of the cell phone market in New York City.
*IPOs, in which bidders need to estimate what the market value of a company&#x27;s stock will be.
*Pay per click advertising online, in which advertisers gain higher ranking if they bid higher amounts per click from a search engine user.
*Federal offshore oil leases: the term &quot;winner&#x27;s curse&quot; was originated in a paper published in the &quot;Journal of Petroleum Technology&quot;, volume 23, 1971, pages 641-653. The authors were Capen, Clapp &amp; Campbell.
*Free agency in professional sports.

==Related uses==

The term &quot;winner&#x27;s curse&quot; is also used in statistics to refer to the regression toward the mean phenomenon, particularly in genome-wide association studies and epidemiology. In studies involving many tests on one sample of the full population, the consequent stringent standards for significance make it likely that the first person to report a significant test (the &quot;winner&quot;) will also report an effect size much larger than is likely to be seen in subsequent replication studies.

<doc id="584443" wikidata="Q3510161" url="?curid=584443" title="Memphis soul">
<text>Memphis soul, also known as the Memphis sound, is the most prominent strain of Southern soul. It is a shimmering, sultry style produced in the 1960s and 1970s at Stax Records and Hi Records in Memphis, Tennessee, featuring melodic unison horn lines, organ, guitar, bass, and a driving beat on the drums.

Many of the songs in this style were performed by vocalists backed by the house bands of Stax, Hi and Goldwax Records. Memphis soul sound is different from the Motown sound from Detroit or the lighter sound of Chicago soul. After the rise of disco in the late 1970s, Memphis soul declined in popularity. The Stax Museum of American Soul Music is dedicated to preserving the Memphis sound.

== Overview/Memphis Soul ==
Soul music is an emotional genre that began by expression of the struggles within the African American community. Soul is similar to genres like Motown or Rhythm and Blues but is unique because of its tonality and origin. Memphis musicians Willie Mitchell and Al Green collaborated to produce the basic sound of all soul music to emerge from Memphis. To this day, the entire genre of Memphis soul music is in accordance with their perfected sound of the 70s.

== Characteristics ==
Memphis soul pulls stylistic influence from jazz, Motown, Rhythm and blues, gospel and Doo-wop music. There is often a call and response between the lead vocalist and chorus. Other characteristics of Memphis soul include handclaps, funky rhythms, catchy melodies, and invigorating body movement by the performer. Brass and saxophones are common in much of Memphis soul instrumentation.

Memphis soul is unique due to its uptown influence on Southern regional soul music. Soul was originally written by and for the black community in Memphis but eventually became popular across all racial groups. Soul was experimental and new. It transformed greatly from the 50s into the 70s. Soul is the backbone of all American music genres today. Soul music directly influenced Rock music in America.

== Memphis Soul Record Labels ==
=== Stax Records ===

Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton converted an old movie theater into a recording studio at the corner of McLemore Avenue and College Street in Memphis, Tennessee. The studio was opened under the name, &quot;Satellite Records&quot;, which was eventually changed to &quot;Stax&quot;. Former WDIA disc jockey Rufus Thomas and his daughter Carla recorded the label&#x27;s first hit, &quot;Cause I Love You.&quot; Soon after, The Mar-Keys, a local R&amp;B group that included Estelle&#x27;s son, Packy Axton, recorded &quot;Last Night&quot;.

For the next 14 years, Stax Records launched the careers and recorded hits for the likes of Otis Redding, the Staple Singers, Luther Ingram, Johnnie Taylor, Albert King, Eddie Floyd, Wilson Pickett, Booker T. and the MGs, Sam &amp; Dave and Isaac Hayes. Of the approximately 800 singles and 300 LPs recorded at Stax, there were 166 Top 100 songs in the pop charts and 265 Top 100 hits in the R&amp;B charts, nine of them Grammy winners.

Under the leadership of Al Bell, the label became one of the first to evolve into a multimedia company, producing spoken-word recordings and the acclaimed documentary film &quot;Wattstax&quot;, recording an event known to many as the &quot;Black Woodstock&quot;. The documentary featured performances by Luther Ingram, Isaac Hayes, Rufus and Carla Thomas, the Bar-Kays and the Staple Singers, along with the comedian Richard Pryor. It also included interviews on the 1965 Watts revolt.

Stax was one of the most successfully integrated companies in the country—from top management and administration to its artists. The company was founded by Stewart and co-owned by Axton. Al Bell eventually joined the team, becoming a co-owner of Stax Records in 1968. With 200-plus employees, Stax was one of the largest African-American-owned businesses in the United States in its time. Because of this, there was a large amount of influence from the African-American community, influencing the sound of Memphis soul music. By 1970, both Stax and Hi Records (described below) had African-Americans included in ownership.

The Stax rhythm section was the epitome of the label&#x27;s integration. The M.G.&#x27;s represented racial harmony in Memphis during the Civil Rights era. Composed of Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn and Al Jackson, Jr., Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s provided the instrumental backing for Rufus and Carla Thomas, Sam and Dave, and many other artists, The group also recorded under its own name, including the instrumental hit &quot;Green Onions&quot;. In later years, members of the group pursued their own individual careers. Jones worked with the singer and producer William Bell and co-wrote the blues classic &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;. Cropper supervised the recordings of Otis Redding and co-wrote hits with Wilson Pickett and Eddie Floyd.

=== Hi Records ===

Hi Records was started by a trio of Sun Studio musicians—Ray Harris, Bill Cantrell and Quinton Claunch—and Joe Cuoghi, one of the owners of Poplar (&quot;Pop&quot;) Tunes, a local record store, Hi Records&#x27; early releases were primarily rockabilly. While the label had success with this sound, rockabilly was declining in popularity, as was Hi Records. Finally, the label had its first hit, courtesy of Harris&#x27; friend, Bill Black.

Just as The Mar-Keys &quot;Last Night&quot; grew Stax Records, the success of Bill Black&#x27;s Combo changed Hi from a rockabilly label to an instrumental powerhouse during the early 60s. But as the decade wore on, Hi Records once again recognized a shift in the musical landscape, and, with the leadership of the producer, bandleader and songwriter Willie Mitchell, evolved into a successful soul music label.

The soul label first emerged on the national scene with Ann Peebles. Approached by Mitchell after an impromptu performance at the Rosewood Club, Peebles hit the charts in 1969 with &quot;Walk Away&quot; followed by &quot;Part Time Love. She recorded &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot; in 1974, which became one of John Lennon&#x27;s favorites.

After a chance encounter on tour in Texas, Al Green joined Willie Mitchell and Hi Records, and together they became the preeminent source for soul music in the 1970s. With hits such as &quot;Tired of Being Alone,&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; and &quot;Take Me to the River,&quot; Green established a permanent identity and a sound for Hi Records, based around a house band which became known as the Hi Rhythm Section.

Mitchell made a name for Hi Records by working with a number of big soul artists (such as Ike and Tina Turner) who were associated with other record labels.

=== Goldwax Records ===

Quinton Claunch was a hardware store owner who had previously worked as a country music guitarist, session musician at Sun Records, songwriter and record producer, and had co-founded Hi Records in 1957 before selling his stake two years later. Russell was a pharmacist who was interested in becoming involved in the music business.

The label had its biggest successes with James Carr, who had a series of hits on the R&amp;B chart between 1967 and 1969, including &quot;You&#x27;ve Got My Mind Messed Up&quot; and &quot;The Dark End of the Street&quot;. It also had some success with The Ovations, Spencer Wiggins, and Wee Willie Walker. The label was dissolved in 1969, as a result of differences between Claunch and Russell as well as Carr&#x27;s erratic behaviour. In the mi

<doc id="584448" wikidata="Q375195" url="?curid=584448" title="Johann Daniel Titius">
<text>Johann Daniel Titius (born Johann Daniel Tietz(e), 2 January 1729 – 16 December 1796) was a German astronomer and a professor at Wittenberg.

Titius was born in Konitz (Chojnice), Royal Prussia (a fief of the Crown of Poland) to Jakob Tietz, a merchant and council member from Konitz, and Maria Dorothea, née Hanow. His original name was Johann Tietz, but as was customary in the 18th century, when he became a university professor, he Latinized his surname to Titius. Tietz attended school in Danzig (Gdańsk) and studied at the University of Leipzig (1749–1752). He died in Wittenberg, Electorate of Saxony.

== Astronomy ==
He is best known for formulating the Titius–Bode law, and for using this rule to predict the existence of a celestial object at 2.8 AU from the sun which led to the 1801 discovery of what we now know as Ceres. He drew up the law in 1766, when he inserted his mathematical observation on planetary distances into a German translation of Charles Bonnet&#x27;s book &quot;Contemplation de la Nature&quot;. In part because of this law, the first four minor planets were at first labeled as full-fledged planets. After a fifteen-year hiatus, other minor planets started to be discovered at steadily increasing rates, and Ceres and company were eventually relabeled as minor planets or asteroids. Because of its spherical shape, Ceres has had upgraded status as a dwarf planet since 2006.

The asteroid 1998 Titius and the crater Titius on the Moon are named in his honour.

== Physics ==

Titius published a number of works on other areas in physics, such as a set of conditions and rules for performing experiments, and he was particularly focused in thermometry. In 1765 he presented a survey of thermometry up to that date. He wrote about the metallic thermometer constructed by Hanns Loeser. In his treatises on both theoretical and experimental physics, he incorporated the findings of other scientists, such as the descriptions of experiments written by Georg Wolfgang Kraft in 1738.

== Biology ==
Titius was also active in biology, particularly in classification of organisms and minerals. His biological work was influenced by Linnaeus. &quot;Lehrbegriff der Naturgeschichte Zum ersten Unterrichte&quot;, his most extensive publication in biology, was on systematic classification of plants, animals, and minerals, as well as the elemental substances ether, fire, air, water and earth.

<doc id="584452" wikidata="Q2592062" url="?curid=584452" title="Fetal distress">
<text>Fetal distress, also known as non-reassuring fetal status, is a condition during pregnancy or labor in which the fetus shows signs of inadequate oxygenation. Due to its imprecision, the term &quot;fetal distress&quot; has fallen out of use in American obstetrics. The term &quot;non-reassuring fetal status&quot; has largely replaced it. It is characterized by changes in fetal movement, growth, heart rate, and presence of meconium stained fluid.

Risk factors for fetal distress/non-reassuring fetal status include anemia, restriction of fetal growth, maternal hypertension or cardiovascular disease, low amniotic fluid or meconium in the amniotic fluid, or a post-term pregnancy. The condition is detected most often with electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring through cardiotocography (CTG), which allows clinicians to measure changes in the fetal cardiac response to declining oxygen. Specifically, heart rate decelerations detected on CTG can represent danger to the fetus and to delivery.

Treatment primarily consists of intrauterine resuscitation, the goal of which is to restore oxygenation of the fetus. This can involve improving the position, hydration, and oxygenation of the mother, as well as amnioinfusion to restore sufficient amniotic fluid, delaying preterm labor contractions with tocolysis, and correction of fetal acid-base balance. An algorithm is used to treat/resuscitate babies in need of respiratory support post-birth.

Generally it is preferable to describe specific signs in lieu of declaring &quot;fetal distress&quot; that include:

* Decreased movement felt by the mother
* Meconium in the amniotic fluid (&quot;meconium stained fluid&quot;)
* Non-reassuring patterns seen on cardiotocography:
** increased or decreased fetal heart rate (tachycardia and bradycardia), especially during and after a contraction
** decreased variability in the fetal heart rate
** late decelerations
* Biochemical signs, assessed by collecting a small sample of baby&#x27;s blood from a scalp prick through the open cervix in labor
** fetal metabolic acidosis
** elevated fetal blood lactate levels (from fetal scalp blood testing) indicating the baby has a lactic acidosis

Some of these signs are more reliable predictors of fetal compromise than others. For example, cardiotocography can give high false positive rates, even when interpreted by highly experienced medical personnel. Fetal acid-base status is a more reliable predictor, but is not always available.

=== Complications ===
Complications are primarily those associated with insufficient fetal oxygenation, most notably increased mortality risk. Other complications include fetal encephalopathy, seizures, cerebral palsy, and neurodevelopmental delay.

==Causes==
Several conditions and risk factors can lead to fetal distress or non-reassuring fetal status, including:
* Low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios)
** If there is too little amniotic fluid around the baby in the uterus, the baby can have trouble moving around in the uterus and its growth and temperature can be impacted. Low amniotic fluid can be caused by placental issues, high gestational blood pressure, some medications, as well as problems with the fetal kidney or urinary tract.
* Meconium in the amniotic fluid
** If a fetus has meconium in their lungs when they are born, this prevents the pressure in their lungs from falling, which normally facilitates the transition to independent breathing. Since aspiration of meconium can lead to improper oxygenation due to obstruction and carries the potential risk for inflammatory pneumonitis, this is an important diagnosis to make in the setting of newborn respiratory distress.
* Gestational Hypertension
** If hypertension in the mother occurs after the 20th week and meets certain criteria, this is considered preeclampsia/eclampsia. The mechanism of preeclampsia/eclampsia is unknown, but consequences if left untreated can include fetal growth restriction or death, as well as pose medical risks to the mother. Signs and symptoms of preeclampsia can include swelling, protein in the urine, headaches, vomiting, and abnormal labs that assess kidney and liver function, some of which may be considered severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.
* Post-term pregnancy
* Breathing problems
* Anemia
* Abnormal position and presentation of the fetus
* Multiple births
* Shoulder dystocia
* Umbilical cord prolapse
* Nuchal cord
* Placental abruption
* Premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus
* Uterine rupture
* Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, a liver disorder during pregnancy
* Maternal diabetes (Type 1 or 2) or gestational diabetes (GDM)

== Prevention ==
Monitoring of the mother and fetus prior to birth is critical to avoid complications after birth. This is often done via electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring, which helps providers monitor the fetus&#x27; heart rate to ensure it is receiving enough oxygen, monitor the mother&#x27;s contractions, and monitor the mother&#x27;s blood pressure and systemic symptoms for gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia.

==Treatment==

Instead of referring to &quot;fetal distress&quot;, current recommendations hold to look for more specific signs and symptoms, assess them, and take the appropriate steps to remedy the situation through the implementation of intrauterine resuscitation. Traditionally the diagnosis of &quot;fetal distress&quot; led the obstetrician to recommend rapid delivery by instrumental delivery or by caesarean section if vaginal delivery is not advised.

An algorithm is used to treat/resuscitate babies in need of respiratory support post-birth. The algorithm steps include: clearing the airways and warming, stimulating, and drying the baby, positive-pressure ventilation (PPV), supplementary oxygen, intubation, chest compressions, and pharmacological therapy. The order of these interventions is set, and each step is done for 30 seconds with heart rate monitoring and assessment of chest movement prior to escalating to the next step in the algorithm.

<text>Cardiotocography (CTG) is a technique used to monitor the fetal heartbeat and uterine contractions during pregnancy and labour. The machine used to perform the monitoring is called a cardiotocograph.

Fetal heart sounds were described as early as 350 years ago and approximately 200 years ago mechanical stethoscopes, such as the Pinard horn, were introduced in clinical practice.

Modern-day CTG was developed and introduced in the 1950s and early 1960s by Edward Hon, Roberto Caldeyro-Barcia and Konrad Hammacher. The first commercial fetal monitor (Hewlett-Packard 8020A) was released in 1968.

CTG monitoring is widely used to assess fetal well-being by identifying babies at risk of hypoxia (lack of oxygen). CTG is mainly used during labour. A review found that in the antenatal period (before labour), there is no evidence to suggest that monitoring women with high-risk pregnancies benefits the mother or baby, although research around this is old and should be interpreted with caution. Up-to-date research is needed to provide more information surrounding this practice.

A study found that CTG monitoring didn&#x27;t significantly improve or worsen the outcome, in terms of preventable child death, post birth mortality, of pregnancy for high risk mothers. But the evidence examined in the study is quite old and there have been significant changes in medical care since then.

== Methods ==

External cardiotocography can be used for continuous or intermittent monitoring. The fetal heart rate and the activity of the uterine muscle are detected by two transducers placed on the mother&#x27;s abdomen, with one above the fetal heart to monitor heart rate, and the other at the fundus of the uterus to measure frequency of contractions. Doppler ultrasound provides the information, which is recorded on a paper strip known as a cardiotocograph (CTG). External tocometry is useful for showing the beginning and end of contractions as well as their frequency, but not the strength of the contractions. The absolute values of pressure readings on an external tocometer are dependent on position and are not sensitive in people who are obese. In cases where information on the strength or precise timing of contractions is needed, an internal tocometer is more appropriate.

Internal cardiotocography uses an electronic transducer connected directly to the fetus. A wire electrode, sometimes called a spiral or scalp electrode, is attached to the fetal scalp through the cervical opening and is connected to the monitor. Internal monitoring provides a more accurate and consistent transmission of the fetal heart rate, as unlike external monitoring, it is not affected by factors such as movement. Internal monitoring may be used when external monitoring is inadequate, or if closer surveillance is needed. Internal tocometry can only be used if the amniotic sac is ruptured (either spontaneously or artificially) and the cervix is open. To gauge the strength of contractions, a small catheter (called an intrauterine pressure catheter or IUPC) is passed into the uterus past the fetus. Combined with an internal fetal monitor, an IUPC may give a more precise reading of the baby&#x27;s heart rate and the strength of contractions.

A typical CTG reading is printed on paper and may be stored on a computer for later reference. A variety of systems for centralized viewing of CTG have been installed in maternity hospitals in industrialised countries, allowing simultaneous monitoring of multiple tracings in one or more locations. Display of maternal vital signs, ST signals and an electronic partogram are available in the majority of these systems. A few of them have incorporated computer analysis of cardiotocographic signals or combined cardiotocographic and ST data analysis.

== Interpretation ==

In the US, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development sponsored a workshop to develop a standardized nomenclature for use in interpreting Intrapartum fetal heart rate and uterine contraction patterns. This nomenclature has been adopted by the Association of Women&#x27;s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada have also published consensus statements on standardized nomenclature for fetal heart rate patterns.

Interpretation of a CTG tracing requires both qualitative and quantitative description of several factors. This is commonly summed up in the following acronym, DR C BRAVADO:
*DR: Define Risk
*C: Contractions (uterine activity)
*BRA: Baseline fetal heart rate (FHR)
*V: Baseline FHR variability
*A: Presence of accelerations
*D: Periodic or episodic decelerations
*O: Changes or trends of FHR patterns over time

===Uterine activity===
There are several factors used in assessing uterine activity. 
*Frequency: the number of contractions per unit time.
*Duration: the amount of time from the start of a contraction to the end of the same contraction.
*Resting tone: a measure of how relaxed the uterus is between contractions. With external monitoring, this necessitates the use of palpation to determine relative strength. With an IUPC, this is determined by assessing actual pressures as graphed on the paper.
*Interval: the amount of time between the end of one contraction to the beginning of the next contraction.

The NICHD nomenclature defines uterine activity by quantifying the number of contractions present in a 10-minute window, averaged over 30 minutes. Uterine activity may be defined as:
*Normal: 5 or fewer contractions in 10 minutes, averaged over a 30-minute window
*Uterine tachysystole: more than 5 contractions in 10 minutes, averaged over a 30-minute window

===Baseline fetal heart rate===
The NICHD nomenclature defines baseline fetal heart rate as:
===Baseline FHR variability===
Moderate baseline fetal heart rate variability reflects the delivery of oxygen to the fetal central nervous system. Its presence is reassuring in predicting an absence of metabolic acidemia and hypoxic injury to the fetus at the time it is observed. In contrast, the presence of minimal baseline FHR variability, or an absence of FHR variability, does not reliably predict fetal acidemia or hypoxia; lack of moderate baseline FHR variability may be a result of the fetal sleep cycle, medications, extreme prematurity, congenital anomalies, or pre-existing neurological injury. Furthermore, increased (or marked) baseline FHR variability (see &quot;Zigzag pattern&quot; and &quot;Saltatory pattern&quot; sections below) is associated with adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes. Based on the duration of the change, increased (i.e. marked) baseline variability is divided into two terms: zigzag pattern and saltatory pattern of FHR. The NICHD nomenclature defines baseline FHR variability as:
=== Zigzag pattern of fetal heart rate ===
A Zigzag pattern of fetal heart rate (FHR) is defined as FHR baseline amplitude changes of more than 25 beats per minute (bpm) with a minimum duration of 2 minutes and maximum of 30 minutes. However, according to another study, even a &gt;1 min duration of the zigzag pattern is associated with an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. Despite the similarities in the shape of the FHR patterns, the zigzag pattern is distinguished from the saltatory pattern by its duration. According to the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), a saltatory pattern is defined as FHR baseline amplitude changes of more than 25bpm with durations of &gt;30 minutes. In a recently published large obstetric cohort study of the zigzag pattern in almost 5,000 term deliveries in Helsinki University Central Hospital, Tarvonen et al. (2020) reported: &quot;ZigZag pattern and late decelerations of FHR were associated with cord blood acidemia, low Apgar scores, need for intubation and resuscitation, NICU admission and neonatal hypoglycemia during the first 24 hours after birth.&quot; Furthermore, the &quot;ZigZag pattern precedes late decelerations, and the fact that normal FHR pattern precedes the ZigZag pattern in the majority of the cases suggests that the ZigZag pattern is an early sign of fetal hypoxia, which emphasizes its clinical importance.&quot;

Furthermore, in the recent study of 5150 deliveries, the hypoxia-related ZigZag pattern was associated with cord blood acidemia, low 5-min Apgar scores at birth, and need for neonatal resuscitation after birth, indicating increased occurrence of fetal hypoxia in GDM pregnancies.

===Saltatory pattern of fetal heart rate===
A saltatory pattern of fetal heart rate is defined in cardiotocography (CTG) guidelines by FIGO as fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline amplitude changes of more than 25 beats per minute (bpm) with a duration of &gt;30 minutes.

In a 1992 study, the saltatory pattern FHR was defined by O&#x27;Brien-Abel and Benedetti as &quot;[f]etal heart baseline amplitude changes of greater than 25bpm with an oscillatory frequency of greater than 6 per minutes for a minimum duration of 1 minute&quot;. The pathophysiology of the saltatory pattern is not well-known. It has been linked with rapidly progressing hypoxia, for example due to an umbilical cord compression, and it is presumed to be caused by an instability of the fetal central nervous system.

In a study by Nunes et al. (2014), four saltatory patterns in CTG exceeding 20 minutes in the last 30 minutes before birth were associated with fetal metabolic acidosis. According to this study, saltatory pattern is a relatively rare condition; only four cases were found from three large databases.

In a study by Tarvonen et al. (2019), it was demonstrated that the occurrence of saltatory pattern (already with the minimum duration of 2 minutes) in CTG tracings during labor was associated with fetal hypoxia indicated by high umbilical vein (UV) blood erythropoietin (EPO) levels and umbilical artery (UA) blood acidosis at birth in human fetuses. As saltatory patterns preceded late decelerations of fetal heart rate (FHR) in the majority of cases, saltatory pattern seems to be an early sign of fetal hypoxia. According to the authors, awareness on this gives obstetricians and midwives time to intensify electronic fetal monitoring and to plan possible interventions before fetal asphyxia occurs.

Due to a standardized terminology and to avoid miscommunication on CTG interpretation, it has been recently proposed in an exhaustive BJOG review of animal and human studies that terms such as saltatory pattern, ZigZag pattern and marked variability should be abandoned, and the common term &quot;increased variability&quot; should be used in clinical CTG guidelines.

=== Accelerations ===
The NICHD nomenclature defines an acceleration as a visually apparent abrupt increase in fetal heart rate. An abrupt increase is defined as an increase from the onset of acceleration to the peak in 30 seconds or less. To be called an acceleration, the peak must be at least 15bpm, and the acceleration must last at least 15 seconds from the onset to return to baseline.
A &quot;prolonged acceleration&quot; is greater than 2 minutes but less than 10 minutes in duration, while an acceleration lasting 10 minutes or more is defined as a baseline change. 
Before 32 weeks of gestation, accelerations are defined as having a peak of at least 10bpm and a duration of at least 10 seconds.

===Periodic or episodic decelerations===

Periodic refers to decelerations that are associated with contractions; episodic refers to those not associated with contractions. There are four types of decelerations as defined by the NICHD nomenclature, all of which are visually assessed.
*Early decelerations: a result of increased vagal tone due to compression of the fetal head during contractions. Monitoring usually shows a symmetrical, gradual decrease and return to baseline of FHR, which is associated with a uterine contraction. A &#x27;gradual&#x27; deceleration has a time from onset to nadir of 30 seconds or more. Early decelerations begin and end at approximately the same time as contractions, and the low point of the fetal heart rate occurs at the peak of the contraction.
*Late decelerations: a result of placental insufficiency, which can result in fetal distress. Monitoring usually shows symmetrical gradual decrease and return to baseline of the fetal heart rate in association with a uterine contraction. A &#x27;gradual&#x27; deceleration has an onset to nadir of 30 seconds or more. In contrast to early deceleration, the low point of fetal heart rate occurs after the peak of the contraction, and returns to baseline after the contraction is complete.
*Variable decelerations: generally a result of umbilical cord compression, and contractions may further compress a cord when it is wrapped around the neck or under the shoulder of the fetus. They are defined as abrupt decreases in fetal heart rate, with less than 30 seconds from the beginning of the decrease to the nadir of heart rate. The decrease in FHR is at least 15 beats per minute, lasting at least 15 seconds but less than 2 minutes in duration. When variable decelerations are associated with uterine contractions, their onset, depth, and duration commonly vary with successive uterine contractions.
*Prolonged deceleration: a decrease in FHR from baseline of at least 15bpm, lasting at least 2 minutes but less than 10 minutes. A deceleration of at least 10 minutes is a baseline change.

Additionally, decelerations can be &quot;recurrent&quot; or &quot;intermittent&quot; based on their frequency (more or less than 50% of the time) within a 20-minute window.

===FHR pattern classification===
Before 2008, fetal heart rate was classified as either &quot;reassuring&quot; or &quot;nonreassuring&quot;. The NICHD workgroup proposed terminology for a three-tiered system to replace the older, undefined terms.

*Category I (Normal): Tracings with all these findings present are strongly predictive of normal fetal acid-base status at the time of observation and the fetus can be followed in a standard manner:
**Baseline rate 110–160bpm,
**Moderate variability,
**Absence of late or variable decelerations,
**Early decelerations and accelerations may or may not be present.
*Category II (Indeterminate): Tracing is not predictive of abnormal fetal acid-base status. Evaluation and continued surveillance and reevaluations are indicated. 
**Bradycardia with normal baseline variability
**Tachycardia
**Minimal or Marked baseline variability of FHR
**Accelerations: Absence of induced accelerations after fetal stimulation
**Periodic or Episodic decelerations: Longer than 2 minutes but shorter than 10 minutes; recurrent late decelerations with moderate baseline variability
**Variable decelerations with other characteristics such as slow return to baseline, overshoots of &quot;shoulders&quot; seen (humps on either side of deceleration)
*Category III (Abnormal): Tracing is predictive of abnormal fetal acid-base status at the time of observation; this requires prompt evaluation and management.
**Absence of baseline variability, with recurrent late/variable decelerations or bradycardia; or
**Sinusoidal fetal heart rate.

=== Updated 2015 FIGO Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring Guidelines ===
FIGO has recently modified the guidelines on intrapartum fetal monitoring, proposing the following interpretation: 
*Normal: No hypoxia or acidosis; no intervention necessary to improve fetal oxygenation state.
**Baseline 110–160bpm
**Variability 5–25bpm
**No repetitive decelerations (decelerations are defined as repetitive when associated with &gt;50% contractions)
*Suspicious: Low probability of hypoxia/acidosis, warrants action to correct reversible causes if identified, close monitoring or adjunctive methods.
**Lacking at least one characteristic of normality, but with no pathological features.
* Pathological: High probability of hypoxia/acidosis, requires immediate action to correct reversible causes, adjunctive methods, or if this is not possible expedite delivery. In acute situations, delivery should happen immediately.
** Baseline &lt;100bpm
**Reduced or increased variability or sinusoidal pattern
**Repetitive late or prolonged decelerations for &gt;30 min, or &gt;20 min if reduced variability (decelerations are defined as repetitive when associated with &gt;50% contractions)
**Deceleration &gt;5 minutes

== Benefits ==
According to the Cochrane review from February 2017, CTG was associated with fewer neonatal seizures but it is unclear if it had any impact on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. No clear differences in incidence of cerebral palsy, infant mortality, other standard measures of neonatal wellbeing, or any meaningful differences in long-term outcomes could be shown. Continuous CTG was associated with the higher rates of caesarean sections and instrumental vaginal births. The authors see the challenge in how to discuss these results with women to enable them to make an informed decision without compromising the normality of labour. Future research should focus on events that happen in pregnancy and labour that could be the cause of long-term problems for the baby.

<doc id="584457" wikidata="Q367032" url="?curid=584457" title="Alfred Newman">
<text>Alfred Newman (March 17, 1900 – February 17, 1970) was an American composer, arranger, and conductor of film music. From his start as a music prodigy, he came to be regarded as a respected figure in the history of film music. He won nine Academy Awards and was nominated 45 times, contributing to the extended Newman family being the most Academy Award-nominated family, with a collective 92 nominations in various music categories.

In a career spanning more than four decades, Newman composed the scores for over 200 motion pictures. Some of his most famous scores include &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;, &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot;, &quot;Captain from Castile&quot;, &quot;All About Eve&quot;, &quot;Love is a Many Splendored Thing&quot;, &quot;Anastasia&quot;, &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, &quot;How The West Was Won&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;, and his final score, &quot;Airport&quot;, all of which were nominated for or won Academy Awards. He is perhaps best known for composing the fanfare which accompanies the studio logo at the beginning of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s productions. Prior to commencing his employment with 20th Century Fox, Newman composed the fanfares which are most often associated with Samuel Goldwyn productions and David O. Selznick productions.

Newman was also highly regarded as a conductor, and arranged and conducted many scores by other composers, including George Gershwin, Charlie Chaplin, and Irving Berlin. He also conducted the music for many film adaptations of Broadway musicals (having worked on Broadway for ten years before coming to Hollywood), as well as many original Hollywood musicals.

He was among the first musicians to compose and conduct original music during Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age of movies, later becoming a respected and powerful music director in the history of Hollywood. Newman and two of his fellow composers, Max Steiner and Dimitri Tiomkin, were considered the &quot;three godfathers of film music&quot;.

==Early life==
Newman was born on March 17, 1900, in New Haven, Connecticut, the eldest of ten children to Russian-Jewish parents who emigrated shortly before his birth. Although many sources show a birth year of 1901, musicologist and composer Fred Steiner revealed that Alfred was actually born in 1900. His father, Michael Newman (born Nemorofsky), was a produce dealer and his mother, Luba (née Koskoff), took care of the family. Her father had been a cantor in Russia, which contributed to her love of music. She sent Newman, her first born, to a local piano teacher to begin lessons when he was five. At one point, in order to take lessons, he walked a ten-mile round trip. With barely enough to live on, his parents once had to sell their dog to make ends meet.

By the age of eight, Newman had become known locally as a piano prodigy. His talent led virtuoso Ignacy Jan Paderewski to arrange a recital for him in New York, where Sigismund Stojowski and Alexander Lambert, at different periods, took him as a pupil. To save Newman commuting cost, Stojowski convinced a ticket inspector to let young Newman sometimes travel free. Stojowski offered him a scholarship, after which Newman won a silver medal and a gold medal in a competition. He also studied harmony, counterpoint and composition with Rubin Goldmark and George Wedge.

===Early jobs as pianist===
By the time Newman was 12, however, his parents&#x27; meager income was not enough to support his large family, which led to him searching for ways to earn an income from music to help his family. He then began playing in theaters and restaurants, including the Strand theater and the Harlem Opera House, with a schedule that often had him playing five shows a day. During the shows, he typically accompanied singers as pianist. Grace La Rue, star of one of the shows, was taken by Newman&#x27;s talent and signed him on as her regular accompanist.

Newman, at 13, also attracted the attention of author Ella Wheeler Wilcox, who wanted to promote him to those who could further his music ambition. She greatly admired his ability to play Mendelssohn, Chopin, Liszt, Wagner and other composers, and with equal skill, in her opinion, as Paderewski. She said he &quot;possessed most unusual moral qualities and characteristics&quot;:

He began traveling the vaudeville circuit with La Rue&#x27;s show when he was 13, where she billed him as &quot;The Marvelous Boy Pianist&quot;. While on tours, he was sometimes allowed to conduct the orchestras. This led to him making conducting his career goal, an ambition furthered by William Merrigan Daly, an experienced music director and composer who taught Newman the basics of conducting. By the time he was fifteen, he was regularly conducting performances for matinee shows. Cincinnati Symphony conductor Fritz Reiner was so impressed by Newman, he invited him to be a guest conductor.

===Full-time Broadway conductor===
When he was nineteen, he began conducting full-time in New York City, the beginning of a ten-year career on Broadway as the conductor of musicals by composers such as George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, and Jerome Kern. He conducted &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot; in 1919, &quot;Funny Face&quot; in 1927 and &quot;Treasure Girl&quot; in 1929. Newman said he was always happiest as a conductor: &quot;I studied music composition and counterpoint because I wanted to be a good conductor.&quot;

In 1930, songwriter and composer Irving Berlin invited him to Hollywood to conduct his score for the film &quot;Reaching for the Moon&quot;. Although the musical film was originally planned to include songs written by Berlin, problems developed between him and director Edmund Goulding, which led to most of his songs being taken out. Newman was kept on and received credit for directing the music, which became his Hollywood debut.

==Film scoring career==
===1930s===

Soon after Newman arrived in Hollywood in 1930 and finished directing the score for &quot;Reaching for the Moon&quot;, producer Samuel Goldwyn offered him a contract to continue on as a movie composer. His first complete film score was for Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;Street Scene&quot; in 1931. The score mirrored the busy and frantic sounds of everyday life in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side in the 1930s. He later used that music theme in other films, such as &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; in 1953, which opens with him conducting an orchestra. The theme is also used in &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;, &quot;I Wake Up Screaming&quot;, &quot;The Dark Corner&quot;, &quot;Cry of the City&quot;, &quot;Kiss of Death&quot;, and &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot;.

In 1931, Charlie Chaplin hired him to orchestrate his film &quot;City Lights&quot;, and used Newman again for &quot;Modern Times&quot; in 1936. Hollywood reporter Sidney Skolsky observed them working together as Newman conducted the 65-piece orchestra. He described Newman&#x27;s ability to carefully synchronize the music to scenes, such as the factory sequence, where Chaplin throws the place into confusion. The music was timed to Chaplin&#x27;s movements.

Newman became Goldwyn&#x27;s favorite composer, while his style evolved with each new film he scored. He scored numerous adventure stories and romances, historical pageants and swashbuckling epics, as did his contemporary, Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Newman also began taking lessons with Arnold Schoenberg, who emigrated to the U.S. from Europe in 1934. In 1937, Newman organized a private recording of Schoenberg’s four string quartets by the Kolisch Quartet at the United Artists.

He received his first Academy Award for &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; in 1938. In 1939, he wrote the music for Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. His score was unique in the way it included different musical themes and created different motifs for the key actors, which helped frame the action. The theme for Cathy, for instance, consisted of a glowing pastoral with strings, while Heathcliff&#x27;s theme, in contrast, produced a darker, more serious image. Also in 1939, he composed the music for &quot;Gunga Din&quot;, and &quot;Beau Geste&quot;.

Among Newman&#x27;s specialties were films with a religious theme, although he himself was not known to be religious. Among the films were &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939), starring Charles Laughton, and in subsequent years, &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965).

In 1933, while he was still under contract at United Artists, Newman was commissioned by Darryl F. Zanuck of Twentieth Century Pictures to compose a fanfare to accompany the production logo appearing at the start of the studio&#x27;s films. Twentieth Century Pictures subsequently merged with Fox Film Corporation in 1935 to form 20th Century-Fox; the fanfare and logo were retained, and have continued in use to the present day as one of the most widely recognised film studio logos.

===1940s===
In 1940, Newman began a 20-year career as music director with 20th Century-Fox Studios, composing over 200 film scores, nine of which won Academy Awards. He wore many hats at the studio depending on the need, acting as composer, arranger, music director and conductor for various films. However, he said that he preferred arranging and conducting over composing because the latter was lonely and demanding work. The demands of work contributed to his heavy smoking throughout his life, eventually leading to his emphysema.

He was noted for developing what came to be known as the Newman System, a means of synchronizing the performance and recording of a musical score with the film, a system which is still in use today. Newman&#x27;s scores were developed around the overall mood of each film. He also tailored specific themes to accompany different characters as they appeared on screen, thereby enhancing each actor&#x27;s role. The effects of this style of music created a forceful but less jarring score which connected the entire story, thereby keeping the film&#x27;s theme more easily understood by viewers.

&quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943) is said to be one of Newman&#x27;s loveliest scores, recorded over a four-week period with an 80-piece orchestra. Newman used three different motifs to color different issues during the film. Among them was a brass chorale to represent Mother Church, while the theme representing Bernadette used strings to support her character&#x27;s warmth and tenderness. Newman&#x27;s interpretation added the sound of the wind and blowing leaves to give the music an ethereal quality that augmented Bernadette&#x27;s visions.

Newman&#x27;s score for &quot;Wilson&quot; (1944), a biopic about president Woodrow Wilson, required he devote an unusual amount of time to research. The film was intended to be a tribute to Wilson by producer Darryl F. Zanuck. Newman spent considerable time learning personal details about Wilson and his family, such as the songs they sang and played on their piano at home, the music they liked to dance and listen to, the songs they played during political rallies or political functions during his career. As a result, the film contained some forty realistic American-themed numbers intertwined throughout the film which gave it a strong sense of timeliness.

In the 1940s, Newman scored a number of films related to World War II. Among those were &quot;A Yank in the R.A.F.&quot; (1941), &quot;To the Shores of Tripoli&quot; (1942) and &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1949), which one historian says is Newman&#x27;s best dramatic opening theme for a movie. Newman also composed or music directed the score to some of Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series of films, including &quot;Prelude to War&quot; (1942) and &quot;War Comes to America&quot; (1945). He created the music for &quot;The All-Star Bond Rally&quot; (1945), a documentary short film featuring Hollywood stars promoting the sales of War Bonds. The previous year he scored another documentary, &quot;The Fighting Lady&quot; (1944).

He often studied period music and assimilated it into his scores. For films such as &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941), for example, he incorporated Welsh hymns. For &quot;How The West Was Won&quot; (1962), he took folk tunes and transformed them into orchestral/choral works of tremendous power. And for &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940), he brought in the folk tune favorite &quot;Red River Valley&quot; throughout the score. His skill at incorporating familiar traditional music into modern scores was not limited to Western themes, however. During portions of the score for &quot;Love is a Many Splendored Thing&quot;, for example, he created numbers with a distinctly Chinese sensibility, both with instruments and melodies. Generally, however, he would create his own original melody and turn it into something haunting and memorable, as he did for &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953).

In 1947, he composed the music for &quot;Captain from Castile&quot;, which included the famous &quot;Conquest march&quot;, an impassioned score for the Spanish conquistadors. The march was adapted by the University of Southern California (USC) as the official theme song for their sports teams, the USC Trojans. Newman also orchestrated and conducted the music for a biopic about the life of American composer John Philip Sousa, &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; (1952), a film which includes numerous marches for which Sousa is best known.

The dramatic score for &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, a 1948 film set in a lunatic asylum, was accentuated by Newman&#x27;s careful use of effects to intensify the discomfort and fear portrayed by the actors, primarily its star Olivia de Havilland.

===1950s===
In 1952, &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot; gave Newman his fifth Academy Award. It was presented to him by Walt Disney. &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953), a New Testament epic, was another of Newman&#x27;s scores with a religious theme, with orchestration creating spaciousness, grandeur and simplicity. The first film in Cinemascope, it featured 4 channel stereo sound, which allowed Newman to experiment in developing the various moods. The score was one of fellow composer Franz Waxman&#x27;s favorites, and he incorporated some of its themes into his own score for the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot;.

In 1954, Newman wrote additional music for his 20th Century-Fox fanfare, extending it with several bars of warm, soaring strings in order to promote the studio&#x27;s adoption of the new CinemaScope presentation. This extended version has remained in use ever since. This fanfare was re-recorded in 1997 by his son David, also a composer, and it is this rendition that is used today.

Newman received his eighth Oscar for &quot;The King and I&quot; in 1956. In 1959 Newman composed the score for &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;. Although based on the true-life tragic story of a young girl during World War II, Newman&#x27;s score focuses on her optimistic personality, which as her diary attests, she continued to believe that people were good at heart. In contrast to Newman&#x27;s use of uplifting violins and a hopeful old European sound for the girl, the score for the Nazis was an &quot;oppressive march in half time&quot; to create a fearsome effect. Music historian Christopher Palmer says that the score is one of Newman&#x27;s finest, which because of its style, elegance and integrity, the emotions portrayed by the actors can be physically &quot;felt&quot; by the audience. It was nominated for an Oscar.

===1960s===
Newman&#x27;s final musical score under his Fox contract was &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959), and after leaving Fox in 1960, Newman freelanced for the remainder of his career, writing the scores for such films as MGM&#x27;s &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), which some consider his most familiar and best score. It is listed on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores. That score and &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965) were nominated for an Oscar. The last project proved to be a bitter disappointment for Newman, when director George Stevens extensively re-edited the film and score. Other composers had to help reconstitute musical segments, and Newman&#x27;s two choral finales were replaced by the familiar &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; of George Frideric Handel. Newman&#x27;s longtime associate and choral director, Ken Darby, described the experience in &quot;Hollywood Holyland: The Filming and Scoring of &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;&quot; (Metuchen, New Jersey: Scarecrow Press, 1992).

Newman remained active until the end of his life, scoring Universal Pictures&#x27; &quot;Airport&quot; (1970) shortly before his death.

==Death==
Newman died on February 17, 1970, at the age of 69, a month shy of his 70th birthday, at his home in Hollywood, from complications of emphysema.

==Legacy==

During his career, Newman was regarded as one of the most important, most influential and most respected figures in the history of film music. He received an unprecedented 45 Oscar nominations, and his 9 Academy Awards are more than any other musical director or composer had received.

His nine Academy Awards are the most received by any musician: &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; (1938), &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; (1940), &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), &quot;Mother Wore Tights&quot; (1947), &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot; (1952), &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; (1953), &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; (1955), &quot;The King and I&quot; (1956) and &quot;Camelot&quot; (1967). &quot;Song of Bernadette&quot; and &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; are original scores, the latter with extensive use of a theme song by Sammy Fain. The other films are musical adaptations, a field in which Newman reigned supreme.

He composed the familiar fanfare which accompanies the studio logo at the beginning of 20th Century&#x27;s productions, and still introduces 20th Century pictures today. A segment of Newman&#x27;s score for David O. Selznick&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937) became the standard music which accompanied the Selznick International Pictures logo when introducing its films. At the University of Southern California, the 280-seat Allan Hancock Auditorium was renovated and re-dedicated as the Alfred Newman Recital Hall in 1999.

While a composer, music director and conductor, he often contributed to the scores of others without credit. When he wasn&#x27;t working on a particular movie, he was often approached by studio production heads needing advice, which he freely gave. Other musicians were constantly exploring new ideas or perfecting older techniques, which required sharing their knowledge with each other. Newman, during his years as a music director, sometimes went further: if one of his composers was stumped for a suitable melody, for instance, Newman would sometimes write a few bars on paper and hand it to the composer, suggesting he try it out.

As a music director, it was Newman&#x27;s job to find and select suitable composers for various films. When he saw a composer&#x27;s potential, he also had the power to sign them to long term staff contracts. Music historian Robert R. Faulkner is of the opinion that had Newman not been music director at Twentieth Century Fox, composers such as Bernard Herrmann, Alex North, and David Raksin, all of whose music was somewhat radical, might never have had such major careers in Hollywood.

In 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp in his honor.

<text>Federico Maria Sardelli (born 1963 in Livorno) is an Italian conductor, historicist-composer, musicologist, comic artist, and flautist, resident in Florence. He founded the medieval ensemble Modo Antiquo in 1984. In 1987, Modo Antiquo also became a baroque orchestra, debuting with the performance of Jean-Baptiste Lully&#x27;s &quot;Ballet des Saisons&quot; in front of an audience of about five thousand.

==Life and career==
He is the main conductor of the Accademia Barocca di S. Cecilia (Rome) and guest conductor of the Orchestra Filarmonica di Torino, Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana, Gewandhaus Leipzig, Staatskapelle Halle, Kammerakademie Potsdam, Moscow State Chamber Orchestra, etc.

He has recorded more than forty Albums as soloist and conductor, published by the labels Naïve, Deutsche Grammophon, Sony, Brilliant, Tactus. A notable protagonist in the Vivaldi renaissance, he performed, recorded and edited a large number of Vivaldi compositions, often in world premiere (&quot;Arsilda, regina di Ponto&quot;, &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, &quot;Tito Manlio&quot;, &quot;Motezuma&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Atenaide&quot;, etc.). He has been nominated twice for the Grammy Award (1997 and 2000) and on 28 November 2009 the Government of Tuscany awarded Sardelli with the Gonfalone d&#x27;Argento, the highest medal of honour of the Regione Toscana.

He is a member of the Scientific Board of the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini in Venice, for which he has published several essays and monographs, among them &quot;Vivaldi&#x27;s Music for Flute and Recorder&quot;, Ashgate Publishing, 2007, in the translation of Michael Talbot.

In July 2007 Peter Ryom appointed him as his heir to continue his monumental work of cataloging the music of Antonio Vivaldi, and since then Federico Maria has been responsible for the Ryom-Verzeichnis (RV). In December 2014 he and Francisco Javier Lupiáñez Ruiz independently identified the earliest known work of Vivaldi, which he has catalogued as RV 820.
In 2015 he published his first novel &quot;L&#x27;affare Vivaldi&quot;, (Sellerio), a historical investigation into the disappearance of Vivaldi&#x27;s manuscripts.

In addition to his musical activities, Sardelli is also a painter, engraver and satirical writer. He is married to the violist and musicologist Bettina Hoffmann.

==Comic works==
Sardelli is a longtime collaborator on the satirical magazine Il Vernacoliere and contributes through his satire of Italian mainstream culture, religion and religious kitsch. His nonsensical style resembles that of Monty Python and Luis Buñuel, but he has a recognizable style of his own rooted in Tuscan popular humor. Sardelli, as a comic author, constructs elaborate parodies of Padre Pio or of Italian &quot;sagre&quot; (popular festivals that Italian farming communities once often organized); the so-called &quot;Proesie&quot; (&quot;Proetries&quot;) that are ineffable nonsense works. His &quot;Le Più Belle Cartoline Del Mondo&quot; (&quot;Most Beautiful Postcards Of The World&quot;) are elaborate stories built around 60s and 70&#x27;s kitsch postcards, often representing children or couples, written in an absurdly baroque and archaic style and lexicon. A recurring character in these stories is that of the fictional dwarf Gargilli Gargiulo.

Characters and comic-strips by Sardelli include:

&quot;Clem Momigliano&quot;: an improbable detective whose character blatantly lampoons mainstream &quot;heroic&quot; characters of adventure comics. Like Mandrake he has a man of African descent as a sidekick, Negro Balongo, who he unashamedly exploits like a slave. Most of Clem&#x27;s adventures begin with a classic &quot;opener&quot; mocking adventure comics and have an improbable mission issued by a mysterious &quot;Chief&quot;, only to collapse miserably because of some trivial impediment such as the neighbour using Clem&#x27;s rocket to anchor her laundry line.

&quot;Il Bibliotecario&quot; (&quot;The Librarian&quot;): a peculiar comic strip made always of two-frames variations on the same theme: in the first the librarian greets an unnamed elderly woman with a flowery and archaic sentence and the woman will ask for an impossibly difficult to find ancient book, such as the &quot;Gabinetto Armonico&quot; of Filippo Bonanni. In the second frame the librarian will reply with totally unconnected and, more often than not, heavily offensive behaviour.

&quot;Merda&quot; (&quot;Shit&quot;): a mute strip where various characters are nonsensically obsessed by their relationship with excrement.

&quot;Circo&quot; (&quot;Circus&quot;): about the adventures of a circus whose animals indulge in embarrassing activities just when the show is to start.
