==Deadliest crash==
2001 remains the deadliest year for aviation in history. The September 11 attacks marked the deadliest ever act of terrorism; an estimated 2,977 people were killed along with the 19 hijackers who commandeered four aircraft in the United States and crashed them into targets including the World Trade Center in New York City, The Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Alongside the attacks, which changed aviation significantly in following years, there were many notable accidents both before and after September 11 that have left a lasting impact on the industry. The deadliest such crash took place when American Airlines Flight 11, the first aircraft hijacked in the September 11 attacks, crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing all 92 people on board and at least 1,600 in the North Tower.

The deadliest non-terrorist crash took place American Airlines Flight 587, an Airbus A300, crashed in Belle Harbor, Queens, shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on 12 November, two months and a mere few miles from the main site of the 9/11 attacks, killing all 260 people on board, as well as five on the ground. As 9/11 was a terrorist attack, Flight 587 is also the deadliest commercial aviation accident in the 2000s decade.

<text>The Neapolitan War, also known as the Austro-Neapolitan War, was a conflict between the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples and the Austrian Empire. It started on 15 March 1815, when King Joachim Murat declared war on Austria, and ended on 20 May 1815, with the signing of the Treaty of Casalanza. The war occurred during the Hundred Days between Napoleon&#x27;s return from exile and before he left Paris to be decisively defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. The war was triggered by a pro-Napoleon uprising in Naples and ended with a decisive Austrian victory at the Battle of Tolentino, after which Bourbon monarch Ferdinand IV was reinstated as King of Naples and Sicily. However, the intervention by Austria caused resentment in Italy, which further spurred on the drive towards Italian unification.

== Background ==
Before the French Revolutionary Wars, Naples was ruled by Bourbon King Ferdinand IV. Ferdinand was a natural opponent of Napoleon and was allied with the Third Coalition against him. However, after defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz and the Treaty of Pressburg, Ferdinand was forced to cede Naples to the French in early 1806.

Initially, Napoleon&#x27;s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, ruled Naples. Then in 1808, Joseph was made King of Spain, and Napoleon installed his brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, as King of Naples.

Murat originally ruled Naples following the same legal and social system used in France, whilst still participating in Napoleon&#x27;s campaigns. But following the disastrous Battle of Leipzig, Murat abandoned La Grande Armée to try to save his throne. As defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition loomed, Murat increasingly moved away from Napoleon, eventually signing a treaty with Austria in January 1814 and joining the Allied side.

But as the Congress of Vienna progressed, Murat&#x27;s position became less and less secure as there was growing support to restore Ferdinand to the throne. The most vocal of all Murat&#x27;s opponents was the United Kingdom, which had never recognised Murat&#x27;s claim to the throne and, moreover, had been guarding Ferdinand in Sicily, ensuring he retained the Sicilian throne.

When Murat was informed of Napoleon&#x27;s plan to escape from exile in Elba on 1 March 1815, Murat sided with him once more and declared war on Austria as soon as he learned of Napoleon&#x27;s return to France.

== War ==

=== Neapolitan advance ===
Joachim Murat declared war on Austria on 15 March 1815, five days before Napoleon&#x27;s return to Paris and the beginning of his Hundred Days. The Austrians were prepared for war after their suspicions were raised when Murat applied for permission weeks earlier to move his troops through Austrian land in order to attack the south of France. Austria had reinforced her armies in Lombardy under the command of Bellegarde prior to war being declared.

At the start of the war, Murat reportedly had 82,000 men in his army, including 7,000 cavalry and 90 cannon, although this figure was grossly exaggerated to try to encourage Italians to join his cause. The real number was somewhere in the region of 50,000 men.

Leaving behind a reserve &quot;Army of the Interior&quot; in case of an invasion from Sicily, he sent his two elite Guard Divisions through the Papal States, forcing the Pope to flee to Genoa. With the remainder of his army, Murat established his headquarters at Ancona and advanced on the road towards Bologna. On 30 March, Murat had arrived in Rimini, where he gave the famous Rimini Proclamation, inciting all Italian nationalists to war.

The Italian population was mostly wary of Habsburg Austria, as they feared the increasing Austrian influence in Italy. Under the terms settled by the Congress of Vienna, direct Austrian rule was restored in the Duchy of Milan 19 years after Napoleon&#x27;s invasion. Habsburg princes had also been reinstated in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Duchy of Modena.

Murat was hoping that an Austrian army in Naples would prove too much and that the Italian population would rise up in support of his cause. However, no such general insurrection occurred, as any unrest was quickly quashed by the Austrian authorities, and Murat found few Italians outside Naples who were willing to take up arms and join his cause. Many saw Murat as a man trying to save his crown rather than a beacon of Italian unification.

By now, the number of Austrian troops in Lombardy had swelled to 60,000, and the commander entrusted with the force to confront Murat was Baron Frimont. The army was originally intended to invade southern France after Napoleon&#x27;s return, but now had to be diverted to face the approaching Neapolitan army. Frimont moved his headquarters to Piacenza in order to block any potential advance on Milan.

Meanwhile, on the same day that Murat gave the Rimini Proclamation, the Austrian advance guard, under the command of General Bianchi, was beaten back at an engagement near Cesena. Bianchi retreated towards Modena and took up a defensive line behind the River Panaro, allowing Murat to take Bologna on 3 April.

Murat engaged Bianchi again at the Battle of the Panaro; the Austrians were defeated and driven back. The Austrian vanguard was forced to retreat to Borgoforte, allowing the Neapolitans to advance on Modena.

Following the battle, the division under the command of General Carrascosa immediately occupied Modena, Carpi, and Reggio Emilia, while Murat moved against Ferrara. However, the garrison in Ferrara withstood the best efforts of the Neapolitans to take the citadel, tying up a large number of Neapolitan troops in a costly siege.

On 8 April, Murat attempted to cross the Po River and finally set foot in Austrian-controlled Italy. Murat had received little reinforcement from the Italian populace up to this point, but he hoped he would find more support north of the Po River, which was under direct Austrian rule.

The region had once been part of the Kingdom of Italy, a French client republic, and it had been reported that about 40,000 men, mostly veterans of Napoleon&#x27;s campaigns, were ready to join Murat once he arrived in Milan. He chose a crossing at the town of Occhiobello. It was there that Murat finally engaged with the bulk of the Austrian army under the command of Frimont.

Meanwhile, the two Guard Divisions Murat had sent into the Papal States had passed unmolested into Tuscany, and by 8 April they had occupied Florence, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The Grand Duke fled to Pisa, while the Austrian garrison in Florence, under the command of General Nugent, was forced to retreat to Pistoia, with the Neapolitan army in pursuit.

But with reinforcements arriving from the north and his army in a strong defensive position, Nugent was able to turn and halt the Neapolitan pursuit. Murat and the Neapolitans had reached the zenith of their campaign.

=== Austrian counterattack ===
The Battle of Occhiobello proved to be the turning point of the war. Murat&#x27;s attempts to cross the River Po proved unsuccessful, and after two days of heavy fighting, the Neapolitans fell back after suffering over 2,000 casualties. To make matters worse, the United Kingdom declared war on Murat and sent a fleet over to Italy.

Meanwhile, Frimont had ordered a counterattack to try to relieve the garrison in Ferrara. He ordered a corps under the command of Bianchi to advance on Carpi, which was guarded by a brigade under the command of Guglielmo Pepe.

Another column was ordered to cut off Pepe&#x27;s line of retreat. However, Carrascosa, who was in command of the Neapolitan troops around Modena, saw the Austrian trap and ordered a retreat to a defensive line behind the Panaro, where he was joined by the remainder of his division, which had been evacuated from Reggio Emilia and Modena.

But even after Carrascosa&#x27;s retreat, Murat was still in a position to continue the siege at Ferrara. In response, Frimont ordered a corps under the command of General Neipperg to attack his entrenched right flank. On 12 April, after bitter fighting at the Battle of Casaglia, the Neapolitan troops were driven from their entrenched positions.

Murat was forced to lift the Siege of Ferrara and retreat back on the road to Bologna. On 14 April, Frimont attempted to force a crossing of the Panaro but was repelled. However, only two days later, Murat and his army retreated from Bologna, which was quickly retaken by the Austrians.

In Tuscany, meanwhile, Murat&#x27;s two Guard Divisions also inexplicably retreated without being harassed in any way by Nugent. By 15 April, the Austrians had retaken Florence, and when the news reached Murat, he ordered a general retreat of his main force back to their original headquarters in Ancona.

With the road to Florence now clear and the Italian peninsula opening up in front of him, Frimont ordered two corps south to deal with Murat once and for all. Bianchi&#x27;s corps was ordered to march towards Foligno via Florence in an attempt to threaten the rear of the Neapolitans and to cut off their line of direct retreat, whilst Neipperg&#x27;s corps was sent into direct pursuit of Murat as he retired to Ancona.

With the war turning in Austria&#x27;s favour, Frimont was ordered back to Lombardy to oversee the army that was now amassing in preparation for an invasion of France. A large portion of the Austrian force was also recalled, leaving only three Austrian corps totalling around 35,000 men in Italy.

Murat, who placed too much faith in his Guard Divisions, believing they would be able to halt the advance of Bianchi and Nugent, retreated slowly, even turning to check the pursuit at the Ronco and Savio rivers.

But the Austrian advanced guard caught the retreating Neapolitan force twice by surprise, at Cesenatico and Pesaro. Murat hurried his retreat, and by late April, his main force had arrived safely in Ancona, where he was reunited with his two Guard Divisions.

=== Battle of Tolentino ===
Meanwhile, Bianchi&#x27;s corps had made swift progress. Arriving in Florence on 20 April, they had reached their target of Foligno by 26 April and now threatened Murat&#x27;s line of retreat. Neipperg&#x27;s corps was still in pursuit, and by 29 April, his advanced guard had arrived in Fano, just two days&#x27; march away.

However, the two Austrian armies were separated, and Murat hoped to quickly defeat Bianchi before turning on Neipperg. Much like Napoleon&#x27;s tactics before Waterloo, Murat sent a division under Carrascosa north to stall Neipperg while his main force headed west to face Bianchi.

Murat originally planned to face Bianchi near the town of Tolentino, but on 29 April, Bianchi&#x27;s advance guard succeeded in driving out the small Neapolitan garrison there. Bianchi, having arrived first, then formed a defensive position around the hills to the east of Tolentino.

With Neipperg&#x27;s army approaching from his rear, Murat was forced to give battle at Tolentino on 2 May 1815. After two days of inconclusive fighting, Murat learned that Neipperg had outmanoeuvred and defeated Carrascosa at the Battle of Scapezzano and was approaching. Sensing the inevitable, Murat ordered a retreat.

The battle had severely damaged the morale of the Neapolitan troops, and many senior officers had been casualties in the battle. The battered Neapolitan army fell back in disarray. On 5 May, a joint Anglo-Austrian fleet began a blockade of Ancona, eventually taking the entire garrison of the city as prisoners.

By 12 May, Bianchi, who was now in command of both his and Neipperg&#x27;s corps, had taken the town of L&#x27;Aquila along with its castle. The main Austrian army was now marching on Popoli.

During this time, General Nugent had continued to advance from Florence. Having arrived in Rome on 30 April, allowing the Pope to return, Nugent advanced towards Ceprano. By mid-May, Nugent had intercepted Murat at San Germano (now Cassino).

Here, Murat attempted to check Nugent&#x27;s advance, but with the main Austrian force under Bianchi in pursuit, Murat was forced to call off the action on 16 May. Soon afterwards, the Austrian armies united near Calvi and began the march on Naples.

Murat was forced to flee to Corsica and later Cannes disguised as a sailor on a Danish ship after a British fleet blockaded Naples and destroyed all the Neapolitan gunboats in the harbour.

On 20 May, Neapolitan Generals Pepe and Carrascosa sued for peace and concluded the Treaty of Casalanza with the Austrians, bringing the war to an end. On 23 May, the main Austrian army entered Naples and restored King Ferdinand to the Neapolitan throne.

Murat, meanwhile, would attempt to reclaim his kingdom. Coming back from exile, he landed with 28 men at Pizzo, Calabria on 8 October 1815. However, unlike Napoleon months earlier, Murat was not greeted with a warm welcome and was soon captured by Bourbon troops.

Five days after he landed at Pizzo, he was executed in the town&#x27;s castle, exhorting the firing squad to spare his face. This ended the final chapter of the Neapolitan Wars.

== Aftermath ==
Shortly after the end of the war, the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily were finally united to create the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Although the two kingdoms had been ruled by the same king since 1735, the formal union did not happen until 1816. King Ferdinand IV of Naples and III of Sicily would become King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, a Spanish Bourbon monarch. Meanwhile, the Austrians consolidated their gains in Northern Italy into the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.

Although Joachim Murat failed to save his crown or start a popular nationalist movement with the Rimini Proclamation, he indirecly and unintentionally ignited a desire for Italian unification. Indeed, some consider the Rimini Proclamation to be the start of the Risorgimento. The intervention of Austria only heightened the fact that the Habsburgs were the single most powerful opponent to unification, which would eventually lead to three wars of independence against the Spanish Bourbons Austrians.

<doc id="566642" wikidata="Q15979307" url="?curid=566642" title="Principal areas of Wales">
<text>The principal areas of Wales, comprising the counties and county boroughs of Wales, are a form of subdivision in Wales. There are currently 22 principal areas in Wales, and they were established in 1996. They are a single-tier form of local government, each governed by a principal council. They replaced the previous two-tier system of eight counties and 37 districts that were in place in Wales from 1974 to 1996.

== Description ==
For local government, Wales is divided into 22 sub-divisions collectively called &quot;principal areas&quot; in the 1994 act. They may be styled as either a &quot;county&quot; or a &quot;county borough&quot;. Each principal area is overseen by a &quot;principal council&quot;, which may also adopt their principal area style, being called a &quot;county council&quot; () or a &quot;county borough council&quot; ().

The basic framework of local government and specifically a council&#x27;s constitution and general powers were set out in the Local Government Act 1972, which simplified the existing local governing structure in Wales that existed prior. The later Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 restructured local government, by significantly amending the previous act. The councils of the principal areas are generally supervised by the Welsh Government.

The names of the principal areas, in both English and Welsh, are set out in the 1994 amended version of the 1972 act, under Schedule 4. Section 74 of the 1972 act allows principal councils to change their names, if there is a two-third majority support for such in a specially convened meeting. Since their establishment, multiple councils have pursued a name change. Any notice of a name change has to be submitted to the Welsh Ministers and the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales. The 1972 changes were enacted in 1974 by the then Conservative administration.

The principal areas&#x27; councils are unitary authorities, and are sub-divided into communities and electoral wards.

Some of the principal areas have county borough status, a largely historical status that reflects their historical existence as major population centres. The eleven county boroughs of Wales are Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Conwy, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Torfaen, Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham. County borough status does not award any different rights compared to the other counties. The 1994 act stated they should not be treated as a &quot;borough&quot; as defined by earlier legislation.

The other eleven have county status, and are styled as &quot;counties&quot;.

The principal areas&#x27; boundaries are made up of its electoral wards, and the average number of electoral wards in a principal area is 40.

=== Name changes ===
Five of the principal areas use different names to those given in the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994. In each case the council renamed the area immediately, with the changes taking effect on 2 April 1996. The changes were:

* Conwy from &quot;Aberconwy and Colwyn&quot;
* Isle of Anglesey from &quot;Anglesey&quot;
* Gwynedd from &quot;Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire&quot;
* Ceredigion from &quot;Cardiganshire&quot;
Other simpler changes also took place such as:
* Neath Port Talbot from &quot;Neath and Port Talbot&quot;

== History ==
Following the enacting of the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, the pre-existing eight counties of Wales (now largely the ceremonial preserved counties of Wales) and its 37 districts in place since 1974 were replaced on 1 April 1996, with 22 unitary authorities, the &quot;principal areas&quot;. The 1994 act also created the communities and preserved counties.

In 2014, plans were announced to reform local government in Wales, reducing the number of principal areas from 22 to a smaller number of unitary authorities, similar to the counties that they replaced in 1996.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales in 2020, the principal areas were used as a basis for local lockdowns.

<doc id="566643" wikidata="Q423839" url="?curid=566643" title="Gyromitrin">
<text>Gyromitrin is a toxin and carcinogen present in several members of the fungal genus &quot;Gyromitra&quot;, like &quot;G. esculenta&quot;. Its formula is . It is unstable and is easily hydrolyzed to the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine . Monomethylhydrazine acts on the central nervous system and interferes with the normal use and function of vitamin B6. Poisoning results in nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea, while severe poisoning can result in convulsions, jaundice, or even coma or death. Exposure to monomethylhydrazine has been shown to be carcinogenic in small mammals.

==History==
Poisonings related to consumption of the false morel &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot;, a highly regarded fungus eaten mainly in Finland and by some in parts of Europe and North America, had been reported for at least a hundred years. Experts speculated the reaction was more of an allergic one specific to the consumer, or a misidentification, rather than innate toxicity of the fungus, due to the wide range in effects seen. Some would suffer severely or perish while others exhibited no symptoms after eating similar amounts of mushrooms from the same dish. Yet others would be poisoned after previously eating the fungus for many years without ill-effects. In 1885, Böhm and Külz described helvellic acid, an oily substance they believed to be responsible for the toxicity of the fungus. The identity of the toxic constituents of &quot;Gyromitra&quot; species eluded researchers until 1968, when &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-formylhydrazone was isolated by German scientists List and Luft and named gyromitrin. Each kilogram of fresh false morel had between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of the compound.

==Mechanism of toxicity==

Gyromitrin is a volatile, water-soluble hydrazine compound that can be hydrolyzed in the body into monomethylhydrazine (MMH) through the intermediate &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-formylhydrazine.

Other &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel&#x27;s toxicity.

The toxins react with pyridoxal 5-phosphate—the activated form of pyridoxine—and form a hydrazone. This reduces production of the neurotransmitter GABA via decreased activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase, which gives rise to the neurological symptoms. MMH also causes oxidative stress leading to methemoglobinemia. Additionally during the metabolism of MMH, &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-formylhydrazine is produced; this then undergoes cytochrome P450 regulated oxidative metabolism which via reactive nitrosamide intermediates leads to formation of methyl radicals which lead to liver necrosis. Inhibition of diamine oxidase (histaminase) elevates histamine levels, resulting in headaches, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Giving pyridoxine to rats poisoned with gyromitrin inhibited seizures, but did not prevent liver damage.

The toxicity of gyromitrin varies greatly according to the animal species being tested. Tests of administering gyromitrin to mice to observe the correlation between the formation of MMH and stomach pH have been performed. Higher levels of formed MMH were observed in the stomachs of the mice than were observed in control tests under less acidic conditions. The conclusions drawn were that the formation of MMH in a stomach is likely a result of acid hydrolysis of gyromitrin rather than enzymatic metabolism. Based on this animal experimentation, it is reasonable to infer that a more acidic stomach environment would transform more gyromitrin into MMH, independent of the species in which the reaction is occurring.

The median lethal dose (LD50) is 244 mg/kg in mice, 50–70 mg/kg in rabbits, and 30–50 mg/kg in humans. The toxicity is largely due to the MMH that is created; about 35% of ingested gyromitrin is transformed to MMH. Based on this conversion, the LD50 of MMH in humans has been estimated to be 1.6–4.8 mg/kg in children, and 4.8–8 mg/kg in adults.

==Occurrence and removal==

Several &quot;Gyromitra&quot; species are traditionally considered very good edibles and several steps are available to remove gyromitrin from these mushrooms and allow their consumption. For North America, the toxin has been reliably reported from the species &quot;G. esculenta&quot;, &quot;G. gigas&quot;, and &quot;G. fastigiata&quot;. Species in which gyromitrin&#x27;s presence is suspected, but not proven, include &quot;G. californica&quot;, &quot;G. caroliniana&quot;, &quot;G. korfii&quot;, and &quot;G. sphaerospora&quot;, in addition to &quot;Disciotis venosa&quot; and &quot;Sarcosphaera coronaria&quot;. The possible presence of the toxin renders these species &quot;suspected, dangerous, or not recommended&quot; for consumption.

Gyromitrin content can differ greatly in different populations of the same species. For example, &quot;G. esculenta&quot; collected from Europe is &quot;almost uniformly toxic&quot;, compared to rarer reports of toxicity from specimens collected from the US west of the Rocky Mountains. A 1985 study reported that the stems of &quot;G. esculenta&quot; contained twice as much gyromitrin as the cap, and that mushrooms collected at higher altitudes contained less of the toxin than those collected at lower altitudes.

The gyromitrin content in false morels has been reported to be in the range of 40–732 milligrams of gyromitrin per kilogram of mushrooms (wet weight). Gyromitrin is volatile and water soluble, and can be mostly removed from the mushrooms by cutting them to small pieces and repeatedly boiling them in copious amounts of water under good ventilation. Prolonged periods of air drying also reduces levels of the toxin. In the US, there are typically between 30 and 100 cases of gyromitrin poisoning requiring medical attention. The mortality rate for cases worldwide is about 10%.

==Detection==
The early methods developed for the determination of gyromitrin concentration in mushroom tissue were based on thin-layer chromatography and spectrofluorometry, or the electrochemical oxidation of hydrazine. These methods require large amounts of sample, are labor-intensive and unspecific. A 2006 study reported an analytical method based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with detection levels at the parts per billion level. The method, which involves acid hydrolysis of gyromitrin followed by derivatization with pentafluorobenzoyl chloride, has a minimum detectable concentration equivalent to 0.3 microgram of gyromitrin per gram of dry matter.

==Identification==

When foraging for mushrooms in the wild, it is important to be cautious of ones that may not be safe to eat. Morel mushrooms are highly sought after; however, they can easily be confused with &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot;, also known as “false morels”. There are a few differing characteristics between the two species that can be used to avoid accidental poisoning. The cap of a real morel mushroom attaches directly to the stem, while the cap of a false morel grows around the stem. Real morel mushrooms are also hollow from top to bottom when cut in half, which varies from the filled nature of false morels. Finally, based on outward appearance, real morels are rather uniformly shaped and covered in pits that seem to fall inwards, whereas false morels are often considered more irregularly shaped with wavy ridges that seem to form outwards.

==Poisoning==

===Symptoms===

The symptoms of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea which may be bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.

In some cases there may be an asymptomatic phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3 days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally, intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increases in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria, which can lead to kidney toxicity or kidney failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin—a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen—are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.

Toxic effects from gyromitrin may also be accumulated from sub-acute and chronic exposure due to &quot;professional handling&quot;; symptoms include pharyngitis, bronchitis, and keratitis.

===Treatment===

Treatment is mainly supportive; gastric decontamination with activated charcoal may be beneficial if medical attention is sought within a few hours of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.

Pyridoxine, also known as vitamin B6, can be used to counteract the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25 mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30 g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200 mg daily.

===Toxicity controversy===

Due to variances seen in the effects of consumption of the &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot;, there is some controversy surrounding its toxicity. Historically, there was some confusion over what was causing the symptoms to form after consuming the mushrooms. Over time, there were poisonings across Europe due to the consumption of &quot;Gyromitra&quot; mushrooms; however, the toxin causing the poisonings was unknown at that time. In 1793, mushroom poisonings that occurred in France were attributed to &quot;Morchella pleopus&quot;, and in 1885, the poisonings were said to be caused by “helvellic acid”. The identity of the toxin found in Gyromitra was not known until List and Luft of Germany were able to isolate and identify the structure of gyromitrin from these mushrooms in 1968.
Gyromitrin may not be considered especially toxic, which may lead people to underestimate its poisonous qualities. In Poland, from 1953 to 1962, there were 138 documented poisonings, only two of which were fatal. Of 706 calls to the Swedish poison center regarding Gyromitra mushrooms between 1994 and 2002, there were no fatalities. In the United States from 2001 to 2011, 448 calls to poison centers involved gyromitrin. The North American Mycological Association (NAMA) reported on 27 cases over 30 years, none of which were fatal. Although poisonings due to gyromitrin are not often fatal, it is still highly toxic to the liver. Of those 27 analyzed cases, nine developed liver injury; there were also three instances of acute kidney injury. As gyromitrin is not especially stable, most poisonings apparently occur from the consumption of the raw or insufficiently cooked &quot;false morel&quot; mushrooms.
There are also possibly several strains of &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; that vary from region to region and have differing levels of the toxin. For example, there is a less toxic variety that grows west of the Rockies in North America. The toxin may also diminish as the seasons change, as most exposures occur in the Spring. This may help explain some conflicting reports on whether the fungus is edible or not.

==Carcinogenicity==

Monomethylhydrazine, as well as its precursors methylformylhydrazine and gyromitrin and raw &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot;, have been shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. Although &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. Even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot;, and it is not known if the potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.

<doc id="566647" wikidata="Q3112653" url="?curid=566647" title="Local government in England">
<text>Local government in England broadly consists of three layers: civil parishes, local authorities, and regional authorities. Every part of England is governed by at least one local authority, but parish councils and regional authorities do not exist everywhere. In addition, there are 31 police and crime commissioners, four police, fire and crime commissioners, and ten national park authorities with local government responsibilities. Local government is not standardised across the country, with the last comprehensive reform taking place in 1974. 

Civil parishes are the lowest tier of local government, and primarily exist in rural and smaller urban areas. The responsibilities of parish councils are limited and generally consist of providing and maintaining public spaces and facilities.

Local authorities cover the entirety of England, and are responsible for services such as education, transport, planning applications, and waste collection and disposal. In two-tier areas a non-metropolitan county council and two or more non-metropolitan district councils share responsibility for these services. In single-tier areas a unitary authority, London borough, or metropolitan borough provides all services. The City of London and Isles of Scilly have unique local authorities.

The London boroughs, metropolitan boroughs, and some unitary authorities collaborate through regional authorities. The Greater London Authority (GLA) is the regional authority for Greater London, with responsibility for transport, policing, fire and rescue, development and strategic planning. Combined authorities are statutory bodies which allow two or more local authorities to voluntarily pool responsibilities and negotiate a devolution deal with the UK Government for the area they cover, giving it powers beyond those typically held by a local authority. Ten currently exist, with more planned.

== Parish councils ==
Parish councils form the lowest tier of local government and govern civil parishes. They may also be called a &#x27;community council&#x27;, &#x27;neighbourhood council&#x27;, &#x27;village council&#x27;, &#x27;town council&#x27; or (if the parish holds city status) &#x27;city council&#x27;, but these names are stylistic and do not change their responsibilities. As of December 2021 there are 10,475 parishes in England, but they do not cover the whole of the country as many urban parishes were abolished in 1974.

The only specific statutory function of parish councils, which they must do, is establishing allotments. However, there are a number of other functions given by powers in the relevant legislation, which they can do, such as providing litter bins and building bus shelters. Their statutory functions are few, but they may provide other services with the agreement of the relevant local authorities, and under the Localism Act 2011 eligible parish councils can be granted a &quot;general power of competence&quot; (GPC) which allows them within certain limits the freedom to do anything an individual can do provided it is not prohibited by other legislation, as opposed to being limited to the powers explicitly granted to them by law. To be eligible for this a parish council must meet certain conditions of quality.

Civil parishes developed in the nineteenth century and were based on the Church of England&#x27;s parishes, which until then had both ecclesiastical and local government functions; parish councils were created by the Local Government Act 1894 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. 73). The ecclesiastical parishes continue to exist, but neither they nor their parochial church councils have any local government role.

== Local authorities ==
There are 317 local authorities (not counting parish councils) covering the whole of England. There are five main types of local authorities: London borough councils, two-tier county and district councils, metropolitan district councils and unitary authorities. Some local authorities have borough, city or royal borough status, but this is purely stylistic.

All local authorities are made up of councillors, who represent geographical wards. There are 7,026 wards as of December 2021. Local authorities run on four year cycles and councillors may be elected all at once, by halves or by thirds; although the Electoral Commission has recommended that all authorities use whole council elections every 4 years.
Local authorities have a choice of executive arrangements under the Local Government Act 2000: mayor and cabinet executive, leader and cabinet executive, a committee system or bespoke arrangements approved by the Secretary of State. As of April 2023, just 15 local authorities have directly-elected mayors. Some functions are just the responsibility of the executive of a local authority, but local authorities must also have at least one overview and scrutiny committee to hold the executive to account.

The London Government Act 1963 established 32 London borough councils. It also established the Greater London Council, covering the whole of Greater London, but this was later abolished by the Local Government Act 1985. Greater London also includes the &quot;sui generis&quot; City of London Corporation. The other &quot;sui generis&quot; local authorities are the Council of the Isles of Scilly, Middle Temple and Inner Temple.

Outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly, the Local Government Act 1972 divided England into metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, which would have one county council and multiple district councils each. That meant that each area would be covered by two tiers of local authorities - both a county council and a district council, which would share local authority functions. In May 2022, 21 non-metropolitan county councils and 164 non-metropolitan district councils remain. These are better known as simply county councils and district councils. The Local Government Act 1985 also abolished metropolitan county councils, but there are still 36 metropolitan district councils as of May 2022.

There are also (as of April 2023) 62 unitary authorities. These carry out the functions of both county and district councils and have replaced two-tier local government in some areas. The creation of these first became possible under the Local Government Act 1992, but now takes place under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.

In the 2023/24 financial year, 33% of budgeted service expenditure across local government as a whole is set to be on education, 19% on adult social care, 13% on police, 11% on children&#x27;s social care and 24% on all other services. 

Notably, Cornwall Council has been subject to a devolution deal, which are usually reserved to combined authorities for additional functions and funding. And, like some combined authorities and parish councils, local authorities do have a general power of competence. Separate to combined authorities, two or more local authorities can also work together through joint boards (for legally-required services: fire, public transport and waste disposal), joint committees (voluntarily) or through contracting out and agency arrangements.

== Regional government ==
=== Greater London Authority ===
The Greater London Authority Act 1999 established a Mayor of London and 25-member London Assembly. The first mayoral and assembly elections took place in 2000. The former Leader of the Greater London Council, Ken Livingstone, served as the inaugural Mayor, until he was defeated by future Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2008. The incumbent, Sadiq Khan, was first elected in 2016.

The Mayor&#x27;s functions include chairing Transport for London, holding the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and London Fire Commissioner to account and keeping strategies up to date, including the London Plan. Meanwhile, it is the Assembly&#x27;s role to regularly hold the Mayor and their key advisers to account and it can also amend the budget or a strategy by a two-thirds majority, though this has not ever happened as of March 2022.

=== Combined authorities and combined county authorities ===
Combined authorities can be created at the request of two or more local authorities. Combined authorities do not replace the local authorities in question, but can receive separate functions and funding. As of May 2022, there are 10 combined authorities covering some of England. The Secretary of State was first granted the power to create combined authorities by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009.

The Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016 gave the Secretary of State the power to provide for a directly-elected combined authority mayor. And, as of May 2022, nine out of the 10 combined authorities have mayors, including Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester and Andy Street in the West Midlands. In the 2024 local elections, new Combined Authorities were elected; they were the new York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority, North East Mayoral Combined Authority, East Midlands Combined County Authority. They are all controlled by the Labour Party as of 2024 except for Tees Valley.

Each combined authority&#x27;s executive consists of a representative from each of its constituent local authorities, plus (if applicable) the mayor. Functions can be devolved directly to the mayor, to the combined authority as a whole, or have a different decision-making requirement. The budget and functions of each combined authority can be vastly different, but possible functions include responsibility for the relevant police force and/or fire brigade, bus franchising and spatial strategy.

==Table of authority types==
== Funding ==
In England, local authorities have three main sources of funding: UK Government grants, council tax and business rates. In the financial year 2019/20, local authorities received 22% of their funding from grants, 52% from council tax and 27% from retained business rates. In the financial year 2023/24, 51% of revenue expenditure is expected to come from UK Government grants, 31% from council tax and 15% from retained business rates. 

Local government can also receive some money from fees and charges for the use of services, returns and interest from investments, commercial income, fixed penalty notices and capital receipts. The Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office has ruled that there is a public interest in disclosing information about local government investments which will generally outweigh any concerns about whether disclosure could affect an investment&#x27;s performance or be protected by confidentiality requirements.

Local authorities cannot borrow money to finance day-to-day spending and so must rely on yearly income or reserves for this type of expenditure, although they can borrow to fund capital expenditure. 

Local government in England as a whole has limited revenue-raising powers compared to other G7 countries.

=== UK Government grants ===
In the 20th century, local authorities found that the costs of providing services exceeded the revenues raised from local taxes and so grants from the UK Government (specifically the Treasury) gradually increased. However, UK Government grants were cut by 40% in real terms between the financial years 2009/10 and 2019/20, although grant income did grow due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Local government receives two types of grants: the Revenue Support Grant, which can be spent on any service according to the wishes of the local government body in question, and specific grants, which are usually &#x27;ring fenced&#x27; to specifically defined service areas.

=== Council tax ===

Council tax was introduced in 1993 to replace the &#x27;poll tax&#x27;. It is a domestic property tax, based on eight bands (A to H) depending on the value of the property on 1 April 1991. Various discounts are set out in law and exist at the discretion of billing authorities.

On a yearly basis, local government bodies review and consider whether to increase or decrease the level of council tax to fund their spending plans. The level at which a local authority can increase council tax each year without holding a local referendum is regulated by the Localism Act 2011. In every area, one local authority acts as the billing authority (the district council in two-tier areas), which prepares and collects council tax bills. Other parts of local government (like county councils in two-tier areas, police and crime commissioners, fire authorities, parish councils and combined authorities) act as precepting authorities, which notify the relevant billing authority of their decision on council tax and later receive this money from the billing authority.

Between financial years 2009/10 and 2021/22, council tax rates increased by 30% in real terms, in light of reduced grants from the UK Government.

=== Business rates ===

Business rates is a tax on business premises. It is based on the rateable value of the premises (set by the Valuation Office Agency) and a business rate multiplier. It is set and collected by billing authorities.

Reforms in 2013 now mean that local authorities keep 50% of business rate revenues raised locally. The UK Government then distributes the remaining 50% of business rate revenues according to its own judgement. It was initially planned to increase the proportion of business rates that local authorities retain to 100%, but this was indefinitely delayed in 2021.

== Criticisms ==
In 2022, the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee said that it had &quot;significant concerns about the current governance arrangements for England&quot;:If the people within government are unsure at times where powers and responsibility, and hence accountability, rest, this lack of clarity is magnified for individuals who have little knowledge or experience of the structures. This has the potential to leave individuals less likely to be able to access what they need from government, leaving them often unable to know who is responsible, and as a result are not properly able to hold their democratic representatives to account.

The Committee also said that &quot;[t]he evidence is clear both practically and democratically that the overly centralised arrangements of government in England are problematic&quot; and that reform was also needed of funding structures.

==Administrative hierarchy==
As of May 2024, the various combined authorities, county, district, and sui generis councils formed an administrative hierarchy as shown in the table below. Unitary authorities are legally either district councils which also perform county functions or county councils which also perform district functions; they therefore straddle the county and district columns. Metropolitan districts and London boroughs are also shown straddling the county and district columns. In much of the country there is also a lower tier of civil parishes. This administrative hierarchy differs from the ceremonial hierarchy.

<text>The Gibraltar Social Democrats (GSD) is a liberal-conservative, centre-right political party in Gibraltar. The GSD was the governing party for four successive terms in office under the leadership of Peter Caruana, from the 1996 general election until the party&#x27;s electoral defeat in the 2011 election by the GSLP–Liberal Alliance.

On 30 November 2017, the party underwent their second leadership election as its leader, Daniel Feetham, resigned in July. As a result, 60.6% of the votes (from executives and members of the party) had gone to support rejoined GSD member, Keith Azopardi, who was a minister and Deputy Chief Minister under the first few years of Peter Caruana&#x27;s run as Chief Minister. Azopardi had beaten interim leader Roy Clinton, who had gained 39.4% of the votes.

==History==
The party emerged, after the collapse of the Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights, as the main opposition to the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP). The GSD was founded in 1989 by former AACR MP, Peter Montegriffo. When Peter Montegriffo resigned his Parliamentary seat in 1991, Peter Caruana who had become Party Leader won that contested bye-election against the then main opposition Party, the AACR. In 1996 the GSD managed to overturn a massive majority that the then GSLP Government had obtained at the previous 1992 general election and were elected to Government. The first GSD administration was made up of Peter Caruana [as Chief Minister], Peter Montegriffo [as Deputy Chief Minister], Ernest Britto, Hubert Corby, Keith Azopardi, Joe Holliday, Bernard Linares and Jaime Netto.

In 2005, the GSD merged with the Gibraltar Labour Party, retaining the GSD name for the enlarged party. The merger was unpopular with many members of both parties, causing some high-profile GSD members to resign their membership, including deputy leader Keith Azopardi and executive member Nick Cruz, who went on to form the short-lived Progressive Democratic Party.

In January 2013, Peter Caruana (who was the then Leader of the Opposition), announced he was stepping down as leader and taking up a backbench position until his 4-year term was over. Caruana declared that he would not fight the next election and will be stepping out of politics completely. The leadership was contested by two GSD MPs: Daniel Feetham and Damon Bossino. Feetham was elected on 4 February 2013 as Leader of the party by majority vote of the executive. This was the first time a party&#x27;s leadership was to be democratically contested between two candidates.

==Policies==
Despite the name of the party suggesting that it&#x27;s a social democratic party, the GSD has been described as liberal-conservative and centre-right. The party supports the current constitutional status of Gibraltar as an autonomous British overseas territory and is opposed to any proposal of joint British–Spanish sovereignty. The GSD has traditionally been less hostile in its attitude to Spain than its main rival, the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party.

==Elections==
In the 1991 by-election to the Gibraltar House of Assembly, following the resignation of GSD Leader Peter Montegriffo, Peter Caruana was elected party leader and won 61.81% of the popular vote to fill in the vacant seat.

In the 1992 election, the party won 20.20% of the popular vote and 7 seats.

In the 1996 election, the party won 52.20% of the popular vote and 8 seats.

In the 2000 election, the party won 58.35% of the popular vote and 8 seats.

In the 2003 election, the party won 51.45% of the popular vote and 8 seats.

In the 2007 election to the newly named (and reorganised) Gibraltar Parliament, the party won 49.33% of the popular vote and 10 seats.

In the 2011 election, the party won 46.76% of the popular vote and 7 seats, unable to secure a fifth term.

In the 2013 by-election, the GSD candidate Marlene Hassan Nahon won 39.95% of the popular vote.

In the 2015 election, the party won 31.56% of the popular vote and 7 seats.

The GSD endorsed the Conservative Party in the 2015 British general election.

In the 2019 election, the party won 25.60% of the popular vote. However they lost 1 seat down from 7 to 6 MPs. This resulted in the Party&#x27;s MP and Shadow Minister, Trevor Hammond, to be unseated and to be taken by Marlene Hassan-Nahon, who recently formed and lead her own progressive party, Together Gibraltar, during the elections.

In the heavily contested 2023 election, the party won 48.15% of the popular vote. They gained 2 more seats, rising 6 to 8, thus returning to become Gibraltar&#x27;s sole Opposition Party since 2015 (1 seat from the sole TG MP, Marlene Hassan Nahon, who announced a couple months before that she wasn&#x27;t seeking re-election and was retiring from politics; and the other from The Alliance&#x27;s new MP, Vijay Daryanani ((LPG)) ). 

Two of their new 2023 candidates, Youseff El Hana (who became Gibraltar&#x27;s first political candidate from the local Muslim/Moroccan community) &amp; Daniela Tilbury received controversy from their past ordeals during the elections. Both of them were polled low and were not elected into Parliament as a result

Youseff&#x27;s past social media posts from 2018 gained controversy due to them being seen as &quot;antisemitic&quot; for his references of his support for Palestine for the ongoing decades-long internal and religious conflicts between them and Israel. He apologised for offending the local Jewish community on GBC News during the election campaign but denied the accusations of him attending an anti-semitic Palestinian march.

Daniella Tilbury also received controversy due to her past allegations of bullying her staff and students during her chair and executive roles at the University of Gibraltar, resulting for her to resign from her posts. No formal apology was made during her campaign.

After the General Elections, there was the party’s leadership elections between the incumbent Party and Opposition Leader, Keith Azopardi and his colleague, Damon Bossino, who was appointed Shadow Minister for Housing, Lands &amp; Transport. The former identifies himself as a centrist and progressive GSD MP whilst the latter identifies as a more conservative figure. On December, the results were in favour of Azopardi with 58% compared to his opponent with 42%.

==Election results==

Gibraltar was part of the South West England constituency in the European parliament and its major parties formed joint ticket alliances with the major UK parties. From 2004 until Brexit, the Gibraltar Social Democrats were in an alliance with the Conservatives.

<text>Alistair Appleton (born 12 February 1970) is an English broadcaster, psychotherapist and meditation teacher.

==Early life and education==
Born in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, to Peter and Sally (née Cooper) Appleton, the younger of two sons, Alistair was brought up in Lee-on-the-Solent, Hampshire, where as a boy he sang in the church choir at St Faith&#x27;s. He earned ten O-levels and three A-levels at St John&#x27;s College, Portsmouth. In 1988, he went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he studied English Literature.

==Career==
On graduating with an upper second class degree, Appleton left the UK for Poland, where he took to writing poetry and helped to edit a children&#x27;s anthology, as well as teaching at the University of Gdansk. He later taught English in eastern Germany and worked as a translator and journalist for &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; television. Appleton broke into television with &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot;, and eventually became the frontman of the channel&#x27;s youth current-affairs show &quot;Heat&quot;.

In 1999, Appleton returned to the UK, where he secured roles on Sky&#x27;s Hot TV (2000), Five&#x27;s &quot;House Doctor&quot; (2000–03), BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Rhona&quot; (2000), the Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Travel On&quot; (2001), BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Garden Invaders&quot; (2001), &quot;Cash in the Attic&quot; (2002–05), BBC Food&#x27;s &quot;Stately Suppers&quot; (2005) and had an appearance as himself on the 2006 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot;. He has also hosted several television specials, including &quot;The Proms&quot;.

Appleton also did some acting, including a role in &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives&quot;, during 2002. In 2005 he completed &quot;The Man Who Drank the Universe&quot;, a short documentary on the entheogen &quot;ayahuasca&quot;, an ancient plant brew from the Amazon.

In early January 2007, Appleton appeared in BBC America promotions for the fourth series of &quot;Cash in the Attic&quot;, even though he did not appear in that series. Since 2007, he has been one of the presenters for &quot;Escape to the Country&quot; on BBC television. He has also hosted the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment&#x27;s late night concert series &quot;The Night Shift&quot; at London&#x27;s South Bank.

In January 2016, he appeared on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, where he came joint second with 21 points, with a specialist subject of 20th-century European classical music.

Outside of television, Appleton works as a psychotherapist at his practice in Brighton and teaches and lectures on meditation. In 2014, he completed an MA in Advanced Psychotherapy.

==Personal life==
Appleton is gay, and came out at university. In an article in &quot;Gay Times&quot;, however, he admits he only fully accepted his sexuality when he lived in Poland and Germany. As of August 2021, Appleton resided with his husband Daniel in a 1930s French sea captain&#x27;s cottage in the port of Newhaven, East Sussex.

In 2000 he converted to Buddhism. He later became a proponent of Ashtanga, the decision made after an unhappy period in his 30s. Appleton also considered becoming a monk while in Thailand, but a friend convinced him not to take that step.

<doc id="566654" wikidata="Q152744" url="?curid=566654" title="Liberal Party of Gibraltar">
<text>The Liberal Party of Gibraltar (Libs or LPG) is a liberal political party in Gibraltar. It was founded in 1991 as the Gibraltar National Party and is led by Dr. Joseph Garcia. The LPG forms the GSLP–Liberal Alliance in partnership with the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party.

==Policy==
In line with most liberal parties, the party describes their political philosophy as being based on notions of people deciding their own future, and are committed to Gibraltarian self-determination regarding constitutional arrangements.

The party believes in &quot;freedom, responsibility, tolerance, social justice and equality of opportunity: these are the central values of liberalism, and they remain the principles on which an open society must be built. These principles require a careful balance of strong civil societies, democratic government, free markets, and international cooperation&quot;.

The party makes its stance on economic policy very clear, stating that &quot;open societies need open markets. A liberal, open and tolerant society requires a market economy. Political freedom and economic freedom belong together&quot;.

==Elections==

In the 1992 election to the Gibraltar House of Assembly, the party (as the GNP) won 4.7%% of the popular vote and no seats.

In the 1996 election the GNP won 4.68% of the popular vote and no seats.

In the 1999 by-election, following the death of GSLP Opposition MP Robert Mor, Liberal Party leader Dr. Joseph Garcia won 51.46% of the popular vote and the seat. He was the first joint GSLP/Liberal candidate to contest an election.

In the 2000 election the party won (in alliance with the GSLP) 14.95% of the popular vote and 2 seats.

In the 2003 election the party won (in alliance with the GSLP) 14.61% of the popular vote and 2 seats.

In the 2007 election to the newly named (and re-organized) Gibraltar Parliament, the party won (in alliance with the GSLP) 13.65% of the popular vote and 3 seats.

In the 2011 election, the party won (in alliance with the GSLP) 14.64% of the popular vote and 3 seats forming the new Government of Gibraltar.

In the 2013 by-election, following the death of Housing Minister Charles Bruzon (GSLP), the Liberal Party backed the GSLP candidate Albert Isola, who has won 49.84% of the popular vote to fill in the vacant seat.

In the 2015 election, the party won (in alliance with the GSLP) 20.61% of the popular vote and retained their 3 seats.

In the 2019 election, the party won (in alliance with the GSLP) 15.5% of the popular vote and retained their 3 seats. At the election, Liberal MP &amp; Minister, Neil Costa, stood down for re-election. His seat was retained by fellow party member, Vijay Daryanani, whom he became Gibraltar&#x27;s first MP from the local Hindu community.

In the heavily contested 2023 election, the party won (in alliance with the GSLP) 14.6% of the popular vote. However, they lost one of their 3 seats to the sole contesting GSD opposition party. This resulted in the Party&#x27;s new MP, Vijay Daryanani, losing his seat after only serving one term in office as Minister.

<doc id="566663" wikidata="Q300498" url="?curid=566663" title="A New World Record">
<text>A New World Record is the sixth studio album by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). It was released on 15 October 1976, by United Artists Records in the United States and on 19 November 1976, by Jet Records in the United Kingdom. &quot;A New World Record&quot; marked ELO&#x27;s shift towards shorter pop songs, a trend which would continue across their career.

Their second album to be recorded at Musicland Studios in Munich, the LP proved to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough in the UK; after their previous three studio recordings failed to chart in their home market, &quot;A New World Record&quot; became their first top ten album in the UK. It became a global success and reached multi-platinum status in the US and UK. The album sold five million units worldwide within its first year of release. The cover art features the ELO logo, designed by Kosh, for the first time; this logo would be included on most of the group&#x27;s subsequent releases. The album yielded four hit singles, including &quot;Livin&#x27; Thing&quot;, the transatlantic Top Ten hit &quot;Telephone Line&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first gold US single, the UK Top Ten hit &quot;Rockaria!&quot;, and the US number 24 hit &quot;Do Ya&quot;, a remake of the 1972 single by The Move, of which Lynne was a member between 1970 and 1972.

In 1977, four of the album&#x27;s songs were featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Joyride&quot;. In 2006, the album was remastered and released with bonus tracks on Sony&#x27;s Epic/Legacy imprint. &quot;Surrender&quot; was also issued as a promotional single and an iTunes download single, which entered the top 100 download chart. The track was originally written in 1976 for a cancelled film soundtrack and was finished in 2006. In July 2012, the all vinyl record company Music on Vinyl re-released &quot;A New World Record&quot; on 180 gram vinyl with an embossed cover.

==Background==

The band&#x27;s frontman Jeff Lynne regarded his own songwriting at this point to have reached a new high.

:– Jeff Lynne 2006; &quot;A New World Record&quot; remaster

Patti Quatro, Brie Brandt (both of Fanny) and Addie Lee sang uncredited backing vocals on the album.

==Critical reception==
The album was well received by the music press. In the UK, Harry Doherty of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; recalled that when Lynne and Roy Wood had formed ELO it was to create &quot;a group that would merge the excitement and colour of rock and roll with the clear lines of classical music&quot;, and that &quot;&quot;A New World Record&quot; is, I feel, the closest that the Electric Light Orchestra have come to realising this&quot;. In his opinion the album &quot;takes a giant leap forward... the most striking progression on this album is the use of orchestra and choir. Strings are no longer a novelty.&quot; In conclusion, Doherty stated that &quot;&quot;A New World Record&quot; is ELO&#x27;s best album in its seven-year history, the most complete of them all. They&#x27;re a band who haven&#x27;t yet gained the attention in this country that they deserve. Acquiring this album would be a fine way to change all that.&quot; &quot;NME&quot;″s Bob Edmands complimented Lynne&#x27;s songwriting, saying, &quot;This is, in fact, a very ambitious album, possibly the most sophisticated the band have put out. But random experiments are no way to crack the States or to stay in favour there, and the complexity on this set is all in the service of strong melodic songs.&quot; Edmands also agreed with Doherty that ELO deserved to be recognised as a major outfit in the UK, saying, &quot;Lynne and his band are in the front rank of the nation&#x27;s rock experts, and it&#x27;s time their standing was properly acknowledged at home&quot;.

Robin Smith of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; said, &quot;Combining electric guitars with highbrow symphonies is a pretty crazy combination, but for the ELO it works. Often the music borders on clumsiness and the lyrics are sometimes silly, but the band&#x27;s sense of fun carries them through.&quot; Tim Lott of &quot;Sounds&quot; declared that &quot;with &quot;A New World Record&quot; Lynne has captured the essential atmosphere of sophisticated pop without sounding overblown or cheap. Each of the nine tracks is immediate, commercial, professional.&quot; He noted some minor failings with the record, but that they were outweighed by the album&#x27;s positive aspects, and concluded, &quot;There ain&#x27;t a duff track anywhere. And trying to balance the superlatives with useless nitpicking and the &#x27;relevance&#x27; of supposed old farts like Lynne would be sheer crap.&quot;

In the U.S. Alan Niester had some reservations in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, feeling that the record was something of a &quot;treading of the creative waters&quot; and that the group were at that point &quot;a band, now peaking in popularity, that is attempting to supply audiences with exactly the sound they want to hear&quot;. However, Niester then went on to note that &quot;Lynne has always been rather deft with the melodic hook, and both &#x27;Livin&#x27; Thing&#x27; and &#x27;So Fine&#x27; are irresistible additions to his list of catchiest tunes. Numbers like &#x27;Mission (A World Record)&#x27; and &#x27;Shangri-la&#x27; continue the history of classy orchestral stylings that really rock.&quot; He concluded, &quot;By Christmas, &quot;A New World Record&quot; should be a staple in a million homes&quot;. Robert Christgau stated that it was the album that changed his mind about the band, who he said had &quot;made a Moody Blues album with brains, hooks, and laffs galore&quot;.

In his retrospective review for AllMusic Bruce Eder compared &quot;A New World Record&quot; with ELO&#x27;s follow-up, the double album &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, and felt that the former album was the better of the two, being &quot;a more modest-sized creation chock full of superb songs that are produced even better... &quot;A New World Record&quot; contains seven of the best songs ever to come out of the group. The Beatles influence is present, to be sure, but developed to a very high degree of sophistication and on Lynne&#x27;s own terms, rather than being imitative of specific songs.&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;the album holds together, with haunting cuts like &#x27;Above The Clouds&#x27; juxtaposed against faster numbers like &#x27;Tightrope.&#x27;&quot;

==Track listing==

The cassette tape version consisted of &quot;Tightrope&quot;, &quot;Rockaria!&quot;, &quot;Mission&quot;, and &quot;Shangri-La&quot; on side one, with side two the same as the LP version&#x27;s side two except for &quot;Telephone Line&quot; at the end in place of &quot;Shangri-La&quot;.

<doc id="566664" wikidata="Q207125" url="?curid=566664" title="Nonverbal communication">
<text>Nonverbal communication is the transmission of messages or signals through a nonverbal platform such as eye contact (oculesics), body language (kinesics), social distance (proxemics), touch (haptics), voice (prosody and paralanguage), physical environments/appearance, and use of objects. When communicating, we utilize nonverbal channels as means to convey different messages or signals, whereas others can interpret these message. The study of nonverbal communication started in 1872 with the publication of &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; by Charles Darwin. Darwin began to study nonverbal communication as he noticed the interactions between animals such as lions, tigers, dogs etc. and realized they also communicated by gestures and expressions. For the first time, nonverbal communication was studied and its relevance noted. Today, scholars argue that nonverbal communication can convey more meaning than verbal communication.

In the same way that speech incorporates nonverbal components, collectively referred to as paralanguage and encompassing voice quality, rate, pitch, loudness, and speaking style, nonverbal communication also encompasses facets of one&#x27;s voice. Elements such as tone, inflection, emphasis, and other vocal characteristics contribute significantly to nonverbal communication, adding layers of meaning and nuance to the conveyed message. However, much of the study of nonverbal communication has focused on interaction between individuals, where it can be classified into three principal areas: environmental conditions where communication takes place, physical characteristics of the communicators, and behaviors of communicators during interaction.

Nonverbal communication involves the conscious and unconscious processes of encoding and decoding. Encoding is defined as our ability to express emotions in a way that can be accurately interpreted by the receiver(s). Decoding is called &quot;nonverbal sensitivity&quot;, defined as the ability to take this encoded emotion and interpret its meanings accurately to what the sender intended. Encoding is the act of generating information such as facial expressions, gestures, and postures. Encoding information utilizes signals which we may think to be universal. Decoding is the interpretation of information from received sensations given by the encoder. Culture plays an important role in nonverbal communication, and it is one aspect that helps to influence how we interact with each other. In many Indigenous American communities, nonverbal cues and silence hold immense importance in deciphering the meaning of messages. In such cultures, the context, relationship dynamics, and subtle nonverbal cues play a pivotal role in communication and interpretation, impacting how learning activities are organized and understood.

==Importance==
According to some authors, nonverbal communication represents . Nonverbal communication can portray a message both vocally and with the correct body signals or gestures. Body signals comprise physical features, conscious and unconscious gestures and signals, and the mediation of personal space. The wrong message can also be established if the body language conveyed does not match a verbal message. Paying attention to both verbal and nonverbal communication may leave the listener with a feeling of being lost, due to not being able to breakdown both at the same time. However, ignoring nonverbal communication altogether would cause the listener to miss up to 60% of their communication, according to experts.

Nonverbal communication strengthens a first impression in common situations like attracting a partner or in a business interview: impressions are on average formed within the first four seconds of contact. First encounters or interactions with another person strongly affect a person&#x27;s perception. When the other person or group is absorbing the message, they are focused on the entire environment around them, meaning the other person uses all five senses in the interaction: 83% sight, 11% hearing, 3% smell, 2% touch and 1% taste.

Many indigenous cultures use nonverbal communication in the integration of children at a young age into their cultural practices. Children in these communities learn through observing and pitching in through which nonverbal communication is a key aspect of observation.

According to Judee K. Burgoon et al., further reasons for the importance of non-verbal communication are:
*&quot;Non-verbal communication is omnipresent.&quot; They are included in every single communication act. To have total communication, all non-verbal channels such as the body, face, voice, appearance, touch, distance, timing, and other environmental forces must be engaged during face-to-face interaction. Written communication can also have non-verbal attributes. E-mails, web chats, and the social media have options to change text font colours, stationery, add emoticons, capitalization, and pictures in order to capture non-verbal cues into a verbal medium.
*&quot;Non-verbal behaviours are multifunctional.&quot; Many different non-verbal channels are engaged at the same time in communication acts and allow the chance for simultaneous messages to be sent and received.
*&quot;Non-verbal behaviours may form a universal language system.&quot; Smiling, crying, pointing, caressing, and glaring are non-verbal behaviours that are used and understood by people regardless of nationality. Such non-verbal signals allow the most basic form of communication when verbal communication is not effective due to language barriers.

=== Practical applications ===
Nonverbal communication encompasses a diverse range of signals that go beyond spoken language, such as gestures, facial expressions, body language, and vocal nuances like tone and rhythm. These cues carry subtle meanings critical to effective communication. For example, facial expressions are a powerful medium for conveying emotions, sometimes even through subtle microexpressions. These microexpressions are fleeting, involuntary facial movements that briefly reveal genuine feeling. They often occur in a fraction of a second, offering a brief insight into a person&#x27;s genuine emotions, some of which may not be intentionally expressed and may diverge from their consciously stated feelings. While some cues might be universally understood, others hold culture-specific significance, necessitating careful interpretation to prevent misunderstandings. Understanding the tone, pitch, cultural connotations of touch, and environmental influences enriches nonverbal communication, shaping our interactions. Recognizing that cultural norms influence the appropriateness of tone and pitch is crucial, as outlined by display rules. This underscores the significance of being culturally sensitive when interpreting nonverbal cues. In the context of intercultural communication, a deeper understanding of context culture becomes essential. Context culture significantly shapes how individuals communicate emotions and convey meaning through nonverbal signals. Being aware of these cultural nuances is fundamental for facilitating successful cross-cultural interactions and ensuring the accurate interpretation of nonverbal expressions.

The understanding of tone, pitch, and cultural contexts in verbal communication complements nonverbal cues, offering a holistic grasp of interpersonal dynamics. The harmony or discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal signals significantly impacts message clarity. In cultures where nonverbal cues are pivotal, incongruence between verbal and nonverbal elements can create confusion, while in cultures emphasizing explicit verbal communication, alignment between the two is essential for effective understanding.

Mastery of nonverbal signals extends beyond mere word comprehension, promoting cultural awareness and smoother interactions across diverse settings. Proficiency in interpreting these cues not only aids in accurate understanding but also bolsters cross-cultural connections, enabling more profound exchanges. Adeptness in nonverbal communication is crucial for navigating social situations, decoding nuanced human behaviors, and establishing meaningful connections in various contexts, underlining the interconnectedness and importance of both verbal and nonverbal forms of communication.

==History of research==

Scientific research on nonverbal communication and behavior was started in 1872 with the publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s book, &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;. In the book, Darwin argued that all mammals, both humans and animals, showed emotion through facial expressions. He posed questions such as: &quot;Why do our facial expressions of emotions take the particular forms they do?&quot; and &quot;Why do we wrinkle our nose when we are disgusted and bare our teeth when we are enraged?&quot; Darwin attributed these facial expressions to serviceable associated habits, which are behaviors that earlier in our evolutionary history had specific and direct functions. For example, a species that attacked by biting, baring the teeth was a necessary act before an assault and wrinkling the nose reduced the inhalation of foul odors. In response to the question asking why facial expressions persist even when they no longer serve their original purposes, Darwin&#x27;s predecessors have developed a highly valued explanation. According to Darwin, humans continue to make facial expressions because they have acquired communicative value throughout evolutionary history. In other words, humans utilize facial expressions as external evidence of their internal state. Although &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; was not one of Darwin&#x27;s most successful books in terms of its quality and overall impact in the field, his initial ideas started the abundance of research on the types, effects, and expressions of nonverbal communication and behavior.

Despite the introduction of nonverbal communication in the 1800s, the emergence of behaviorism in the 1920s paused further research on nonverbal communication. Behaviorism is defined as the theory of learning that describes people&#x27;s behavior as acquired through conditioning. Behaviorists such as B.F. Skinner trained pigeons to engage in various behaviors to demonstrate how animals engage in behaviors with rewards.

While most psychology researchers were exploring behaviorism, the study of nonverbal communication as recorded on film began in 1955–56 at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences through a project which came to be called the &quot;Natural History of an Interview&quot;. The initial participants included two psychiatrists, Frieda Fromm-Reichman and Henry Brosin, two linguists, Norman A. McQuown and Charles Hockett, and also two anthropologists, Clyde Kluckhohn and David M. Schneider (these last two withdrew by the end of 1955, and did not participate in the major group project). In their place, two other anthropologists, Ray Birdwhistell, already then known as the founder of kinesics, the study of body motion communication, and Gregory Bateson, known more generally as a human communication theorist, both joined the team in 1956. Albert Scheflen and Adam Kendon were among those who joined one of the small research teams continuing research once the year at CASBS ended. The project analyzed a film made by Bateson, using an analytic method called at the time &quot;natural history&quot;, and later, mostly by Scheflen, &quot;context analysis&quot;. The result remained unpublished, as it was enormous and unwieldy, but it was available on microfilm by 1971. The method involves transcribing filmed or videotaped behavior in excruciating detail, and was later used in studying the sequence and structure of human greetings, social behaviors at parties, and the function of posture during interpersonal interaction.

Research on nonverbal communication rocketed during the mid-1960s by a number of psychologists and researchers. Michael Argyle and Janet Dean Fodor, for example, studied the relationship between eye contact and conversational distance. Ralph V. Exline examined patterns of looking while speaking and looking while listening. Eckhard Hess produced several studies pertaining to pupil dilation that were published in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Robert Sommer studied the relationship between personal space and the environment. Robert Rosenthal discovered that expectations made by teachers and researchers can influence their outcomes, and that subtle, nonverbal cues may play an important role in this process. Albert Mehrabian studied the nonverbal cues of liking and immediacy. By the 1970s, a number of scholarly volumes in psychology summarized the growing body of research, such as Shirley Weitz&#x27;s &quot;Nonverbal Communication&quot; and Marianne LaFrance and Clara Mayo&#x27;s &quot;Moving Bodies&quot;. Popular books included &quot;Body Language&quot; (Fast, 1970), which focused on how to use nonverbal communication to attract other people, and &quot;How to Read a Person Like a Book&quot; (Nierenberg &amp; Calero, 1971) which examined nonverbal behavior in negotiation situations. The journal &quot;Environmental Psychology and Nonverbal Behavior&quot; was founded in 1976.

In 1970, Argyle hypothesized that although spoken language is used for communicating the meaning about events external to the person communicating, the nonverbal codes are used to create and strengthen interpersonal relationships. When someone wishes to avoid conflicting or embarrassing events during communication, it is considered proper and correct by the hypothesis to communicate attitudes towards others non-verbally instead of verbally. Along with this philosophy, Michael Argyle also found and concluded in 1988 that there are five main functions of nonverbal body behavior and gestures in human communications: self-presentation of one&#x27;s whole personality, rituals and cultural greetings, expressing interpersonal attitudes, expressing emotions, and to accompany speech in managing the cues set in the interactions between the speaker and the listener.

==First impression==

It takes just one-tenth of a second for someone to judge and make their first impression. According to a study from Princeton University, this short amount of time is enough for a person to determine several attributes about an individual. These attributes included &quot;attractiveness, likeability, trustworthiness, competence, and aggressiveness.&quot; A first impression is a lasting non-verbal communicator. The way a person portrays themselves on the first encounter is non-verbal statement to the observer. Presentation can include clothing and other visible attributes such as facial expressions or facial traits in general. Negative impressions can also be based on presentation and on personal prejudice. First impressions, although sometimes misleading, can in many situations be an accurate depiction of others.

In terms of culture, collectivists have a harder time changing their first impressions because they emphasize a lot more context and need additional time when faced with new clues as each view may be correct in some contexts. Moreover, Fang et al., acknowledged that first impression is less likely to change in Asian culture because they value cohesiveness and consensus, thus will not destroy their group cohesiveness at the expense of changing their first impression when they reached a consensus.

==Posture==

Posture is a nonverbal cue that is associated with positioning and that these two are used as sources of information about individual&#x27;s characteristics, attitudes, and feelings about themselves and other people. There are many different types of body positioning to portray certain postures, including slouching, towering, legs spread, jaw thrust, shoulders forward, and arm crossing. The posture or bodily stance exhibited by individuals communicates a variety of messages whether good or bad. A study, for instance, identified around 200 postures that are related to maladjustment and withholding of information.

Posture can be used to determine a participant&#x27;s degree of attention or involvement, the difference in status between communicators, and the level of fondness a person has for the other communicator, depending on body &quot;openness&quot;. It can also be effectively used as a way for an individual to convey a desire to increase, limit, or avoid interaction with another person. Studies investigating the impact of posture on interpersonal relationships suggest that mirror-image congruent postures, where one person&#x27;s left side is parallel to the other person&#x27;s right side, leads to favorable perception of communicators and positive speech; a person who displays a forward lean or decreases a backward lean also signifies positive sentiment during communication.

Posture can be situation-relative, that is, people will change their posture depending on the situation they are in. This can be demonstrated in the case of relaxed posture when an individual is within a nonthreatening situation and the way one&#x27;s body tightens or become rigid when under stress.

==Clothing==
Clothing is one of the most common forms of non-verbal communication. The study of clothing and other objects as a means of non-verbal communication is known as &quot;artifactics&quot; or &quot;objectics&quot;. The types of clothing that an individual wears convey nonverbal cues about their personality, background and financial status, and how others will respond to them. An individual&#x27;s clothing style can demonstrate their culture, mood, level of confidence, interests, age, authority, and values/beliefs. For instance, Jewish men may wear a yarmulke to outwardly communicate their religious belief. Similarly, clothing can communicate what nationality a person or group is; for example, in traditional festivities Scottish men often wear kilts to specify their culture.

Aside from communicating a person&#x27;s beliefs and nationality, clothing can be used as a nonverbal cue to attract others. Men and women may shower themselves with accessories and high-end fashion to attract partners interested. In this case, clothing is a form of self-expression where people can flaunt their power, wealth, sex appeal, or creativity. A study of the clothing worn by women attending discothèques, carried out in Vienna, Austria. It showed that in certain groups of women (especially women who were without their partners), motivation for sex and levels of sexual hormones were correlated with aspects of their clothing, especially the amount of skin displayed and the presence of sheer clothing.

The way one chooses to dress tells a lot about one&#x27;s personality. The University of North Carolina studied how undergraduate women chose to dress and their personality types. The study showed that women dressed &quot;primarily for comfort and practicality were more self-controlled, dependable, and socially well adjusted.&quot; Women who did not like to stand out in a crowd typically had more conservative and traditional views and beliefs. Clothing, although non-verbal, tells people what the individual&#x27;s personality is. The way a person dresses is typically rooted in deeper internal motivations such as emotions, experiences, and culture. Clothing expresses who they are or who they want to be that day. It shows other people who they want to be associated with and where they fit in. Clothing can start relationships because they clue other people into the wearer.

When it comes to the clothing that they wear, nonverbal communication with gangs is very common. Gang members typically wear 2–3 colors to signify that they are representing a particular neighborhood. Baseball caps and hats with specific gang names and initials, worn backwards, tilted, in certain colors, etc. bandanas worn around the head, shoulders, arms, or legs. Gang members frequently dress in hip-hop-inspired fashions, such as oversized pants worn below the waist (also known as &quot;sagging&quot;). Colored belts, colored shoes, and colored bandanas are all utilized as identifiers. Group colors and clothing are commonly used to represent affiliation.

==Gestures==

Gestures may be made with the hands, arms or body, and also include movements of the head, face and eyes, such as winking, nodding, or rolling one&#x27;s eyes. Although the study of gesture is still in its infancy, some broad categories of gestures have been identified by researchers. The most familiar are the so-called emblems or quotable gestures. These are conventional, culture-specific gestures that can be used as replacement for words, such as the hand wave used in western cultures for &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;. A single emblematic gesture can have a very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive. For a list of emblematic gestures, see List of gestures. There are some universal gestures like the shoulder shrug.

Gestures can also be categorized as either speech independent or speech related. Speech-independent gestures are dependent upon culturally accepted interpretation and have a direct verbal translation. A wave or a peace sign are examples of speech-independent gestures. Speech-related gestures are used in parallel with verbal speech; this form of nonverbal communication is used to emphasize the message that is being communicated. Speech-related gestures are intended to provide supplemental information to a verbal message such as pointing to an object of discussion.

Facial expressions, more than anything, serve as a practical means of communication. With all the various muscles that precisely control mouth, lips, eyes, nose, forehead, and jaw, human faces are estimated to be capable of more than ten thousand different expressions. This versatility makes non-verbals of the face extremely efficient and honest, unless deliberately manipulated. In addition, many of these emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, shame, anguish and interest are universally recognized.

Displays of emotions can generally be categorized into two groups: negative and positive. Negative emotions usually manifest as increased tension in various muscle groups: tightening of jaw muscles, furrowing of forehead, squinting eyes, or lip occlusion (when the lips seemingly disappear). In contrast, positive emotions are revealed by the loosening of the furrowed lines on the forehead, relaxation of the muscles around the mouth, and widening of the eye area. When individuals are truly relaxed and at ease, the head will also tilt to the side, exposing our most vulnerable area, the neck. This is a high-comfort display, often seen during courtship, that is nearly impossible to mimic when tense or suspicious.

Gestures can be subdivided into three groups:

===Adapters===
Some hand movements are not considered to be gestures. They consist of manipulations either of the person or some object (e.g. clothing, pencils, eyeglasses)—the kinds of scratching, fidgeting, rubbing, tapping, and touching that people often do with their hands. These behaviors can show that a person is experiencing anxiety or feeling of discomfort, typical when the individual is not the one in control of the conversation or situation and therefore expresses this uneasiness subconsciously. Such behaviors are referred to as adapters. They may not be perceived as meaningfully related to the speech in which they accompany, but may serve as the basis for dispositional inferences of the speaker&#x27;s emotion (nervous, uncomfortable, bored.) These types of movements are believed to express the unconscious thoughts and feelings of a person, or those thoughts and emotions one is trying to consciously hide.

===Symbolic===
Other hand movements are gestures. They are movements with specific, conventionalized meanings called symbolic gestures. They are the exact opposite of adaptors, since their meanings are intended to be communicated and they have a specific meaning for the person who gives the gesture and the person to receive it. Familiar symbolic gestures include the &quot;raised fist,&quot; &quot;bye-bye,&quot; and &quot;thumbs up.&quot; In contrast to adapters, symbolic gestures are used intentionally and serve a clear communicative function. Sign languages are highly developed systems of symbolic gesture. Some educators that work with deaf learners use a combination of cued speech and lip speaking and reading that helps deaf and hard hearing individuals (D/HH) to code and decode words based on their phonetics. In addition to the supplementary aspect of the cues like location and movement, every culture has their own set of gestures, some of which are unique only to a specific culture. For example, the phonological and lexical repository of D/HH individuals is highly dependent on their social background and richness of language. Very similar gestures can have very different meanings across cultures. Symbolic gestures are usually used in the absence of speech but can also accompany speech.

===Conversational===
The middle ground between adapters and symbolic gestures is occupied by conversational gestures. These gestures do not refer to actions or words but do accompany speech. Conversational gestures are hand movements that accompany speech and are related to the speech they accompany. Though they do accompany speech, conversational gestures are not seen in the absence of speech and are only made by the person who is speaking.

There are a few types of conversational gestures, specifically motor and lexical movements.  Motor movements are those which are rhythmical and repetitive, do not have to be accompanied by anything spoken due to their simple meaning, and the speaker&#x27;s hand usually sticks to one position. When paired with verbal communication, they can be used to stress certain syllables. An example of this would be pointing someone in the direction of an individual and saying, &quot;That way.&quot; In this case, the &quot;That&quot; in the sentence would be stressed by the movements. Lexical movements are more complex, not rhythmic, or repetitive, but rather lengthy and varied. An example of this would be something like giving elaborate directions to somewhere and pairing that with various hands movements to signal the various turns to take.

==Distance==

According to Edward T. Hall, the amount of space we maintain between ourselves and the persons with whom we are communicating shows the importance of the science of proxemics. In this process, it is seen how we feel towards the others at that particular time. Within American culture Hall defines four primary distance zones: (i) intimate (touching to eighteen inches [0–46 centimetres]) distance, (ii) personal (eighteen inches to four feet, [0.46–1.22 metres]) distance, (iii) social (four to twelve feet [1.22–3.66 metres]) distance, and (iv) public (more than twelve feet [3.66 metres]) distance. Intimate distance is considered appropriate for familiar relationships and indicates closeness and trust. Personal distance is still close but keeps another &quot;at arm&#x27;s length&quot; and is considered the most comfortable distance for most of our interpersonal contact, while social distance is used for the kind of communication that occurs in business relationships and, sometimes, in the classroom. Public distance occurs in situations where two-way communication is not desirable or possible.

==Eye contact==


Eye contact is the instance when two people look at each other&#x27;s eyes at the same time; it is the primary nonverbal way of indicating engagement, interest, attention and involvement. Nonverbal communication involves the conscious and unconscious processes of &quot;encoding&quot; and &quot;decoding&quot;. Encoding is defined as our ability to express emotions in a way that the receiver(s). Decoding is called &quot;nonverbal sensitivity&quot;, defined as the ability to take this encoded emotion and interpret its meanings accurately to what the sender intended. Encoding is the act of generating information such as facial expressions, gestures, and postures. Some studies have demonstrated that people use their eyes to indicate interest. This includes frequently recognized actions of winking and movements of the eyebrows. Disinterest is highly noticeable when little or no eye contact is made in a social setting. When an individual is interested, however, the pupils will dilate.

According to Eckman, &quot;Eye contact (also called mutual gaze) is another major channel of nonverbal communication. The duration of eye contact is its most meaningful aspect.&quot; Generally speaking, the longer there is established eye contact between two people, the greater the intimacy levels.
Gaze comprises the actions of looking while talking and listening. The length of a gaze, the frequency of glances, patterns of fixation, pupil dilation, and blink rate are all important cues in nonverbal communication. According to Descroix et al., the context of conversations does not produce long blinks between the emitter and the recipient. &quot;Liking generally increases as mutual gazing increases.&quot;

Along with the detection of disinterest, deceit can also be observed in a person. Hogan states &quot;when someone is being deceptive their eyes tend to blink a lot more. Eyes act as leading indicator of truth or deception,&quot; Both nonverbal and verbal cues are useful when detecting deception. It is typical for people who are detecting lies to rely consistently on verbal cues but this can hinder how well they detect deception. Those who are lying and those who are telling the truth possess different forms of nonverbal and verbal cues and this is important to keep in mind. In addition, it is important to note that understanding the cultural background of a person will influence how easily deception is detectable because nonverbal cues may differ depending on the culture. In addition to eye contact these nonverbal cues can consist of physiological aspects including pulse rate as well as levels of perspiration. In addition eye aversion can be predictive of deception. Eye aversion is the avoidance of eye contact. Eye contact and facial expressions provide important social and emotional information. Overall, as Pease states, &quot;Give the amount of eye contact that makes everyone feel comfortable. Unless looking at others is a cultural no-no, lookers gain more credibility than non-lookers&quot;

In concealing deception, nonverbal communication makes it easier to lie without being revealed. This is the conclusion of a study where people watched made-up interviews of persons accused of having stolen a wallet. The interviewees lied in about 50% of the cases. People had access to either written transcript of the interviews, or audio tape recordings, or video recordings. The more clues that were available to those watching, the larger was the trend that interviewees who actually lied were judged to be truthful. That is, people that are clever at lying can use tone of voice and facial expressions to give the impression that they are truthful. Contrary to popular belief, a liar does not always avoid eye contact. In an attempt to be more convincing, liars deliberately made more eye contact with interviewers than those that were telling the truth. However, there are many cited examples of cues to deceit, delivered via nonverbal (paraverbal and visual) communication channels, through which deceivers supposedly unwittingly provide clues to their concealed knowledge or actual opinions. Most studies examining the nonverbal cues to deceit rely upon human coding of video footage (c.f. Vrij, 2008), although a recent study also demonstrated bodily movement differences between truth-tellers and liars using an automated body motion capture system.

==Scent==
== Vocalics ==
Nonverbal communication stands in contrast to communication through words, but includes other aspects of the speech signal. In particular, prosody, and in particular vocalics, plays a very important part in nonverbal communication. Prosodic properties such as tempo, volume, inflection, pauses, and pitch can combine to communicate emotion and attitude without using specific words. Vocalics also includes emblems, or sounds with specific meanings, like saying “brrr” when you are cold or “hmm” when you are thinking about something. These are not specific words, but noises that further convey a person’s message. These sounds are often accompanied by other nonverbal cues.

Infants heavily rely on nonverbal vocalics to communicate their needs. As caregivers talk with their baby, the baby can pick up intonation as well start to mimic and use it themselves. As they go on, babies can pick up more and learn how to develop their own voices and vocalics.

Furthermore, in a study highlighted by Pearce and Conklin, they found that changing the vocalics of an audio recording of the same speech gave different results of liking. When the speaker gave his speech as more conversational instead of dynamic, he was deemed more trust worthy.

Vocalics can heavily influence communication through its many different cues.

==Across cultures==
=== Overview ===
While not traditionally thought of as &quot;talk,&quot; nonverbal communication has been found to contain highly precise and symbolic meanings, similar to verbal speech. However the meanings in nonverbal communication are conveyed through the use of gesture, posture changes, and timing. Nuances across different aspects of nonverbal communication can be found in cultures all around the world. These differences can often lead to miscommunication between people of different cultures, who usually do not mean to offend. Differences can be based in preferences for mode of communication, like the Chinese, who prefer silence over verbal communication. Differences can even be based on how cultures perceive the passage of time. Chronemics, how people handle time, can be categorized in two ways: polychronic which is when people do many activities at once and is common in Italy and Spain, or monochronic which is when people do one thing at a time which is common in America. Because nonverbal communication can vary across many axes—gestures, gaze, clothing, posture, direction, or even environmental cues like lighting—there is a lot of room for cultural differences. In Japan, a country which prides itself on the best customer service, workers tend to use wide arm gestures to give clear directions to strangers—accompanied by the ever-present bow to indicate respect. One of the main factors that differentiates nonverbal communication in cultures is high and low-context. Context relates to certain events and the meaning that is ultimately derived from it. &quot;High-context&quot; cultures rely mostly on nonverbal cues and gestures, using elements such as the closeness of the kind of the relationships they have with others, strict social hierarchies and classes and deep cultural tradition and widely known beliefs and rules. In contrast, &quot;low-context&quot; cultures depend largely on words and verbal communication, where communications are direct and social hierarchies are way less tense and more loose.

===Gestures===

Gestures vary widely across cultures in how they are used and what they mean. A common example is pointing. In the United States, pointing is the gesture of a finger or hand to indicate or &quot;come here please&quot; when beckoning a dog. But pointing with one finger is also considered to be rude by some cultures. Those from Asian cultures typically use their entire hand to point to something. Other examples include, sticking your tongue out. In Western countries, it can be seen as mockery, but in Polynesia it serves as a greeting and a sign of reverence. Clapping is a North American way of applauding, but in Spain is used to summon a waiter at a restaurant. Differences in nodding and shaking the head to indicate agreement and disagreement also exist. Northern Europeans nodding their heads up and down to say &quot;yes&quot;, and shaking their head from side to side to say &quot;no&quot;. But the Greeks have for at least three thousand years used the upward nod for disagreement and the downward nod for agreement.&quot; There are many ways of waving goodbye: Americans face the palm outward and move the hand side to side, Italians face the palm inward and move the fingers facing the other person, French and Germans face the hand horizontal and move the fingers toward the person leaving. Also, it is important to note that gestures are used in more informal settings and more often by children. People in the United States commonly use the &quot;OK&quot; hand gesture to give permission and allow an action. In Japan, however, the same sign means &quot;money&quot;. It refers to &quot;zero&quot; or &quot;nothing&quot; in several cultures besides these two (Argentina, Belgium, French and the Portuguese). To Eastern European cultures that same &quot;OK&quot; sign is considered a vulgar swearing gesture. In certain Commonwealth cultures, the index and middle fingers only extended with the palm pointing outwards can be an insulting gesture, while in others it simply means the number &quot;two&quot; or the &quot;V for Victory&quot; sign, while the same sign with the palm pointing inwards means &quot;peace&quot; in some cultures.

=== Speech-independent gestures ===
Speech-independent gestures are nonverbal cues that communicate a word or an expression, most commonly a dictionary definition. Although there is differences in nonverbal gestures across cultures, speech-independent gestures must have an agreeable understanding among people affiliated with that culture or subculture on what that gesture&#x27;s interpretation is. As most humans use gestures to better clarify their speech, speech-independent gestures do not rely on speech for their meaning. Usually they transpire into a single gesture.

Many speech-independent gestures are made with the hand, the &quot;ring&quot; gesture usually comes across as asking someone if they are okay. There are several that could be performed through the face. For example, a nose wrinkle could universally mean disapproval or disgust. Nodding your head up and down or side to side indicate an understanding or lack of when the speaker is talking. Just because speech-independent speech does not need actual speech for understanding the gesture, it still needs context. Using your middle finger is a gesture that could be used within different contexts. It could be comical or derogatory. The only way to know is if one analyzes the other behaviors surrounding it and depending on who the speaker is and who the speaker is addressing.

===Displays of emotion===
Emotions are a key factor in nonverbal communication. Just as gestures and other hand movements vary across cultures, so does the way people display their emotions. For example, &quot;In many cultures, such as the Arab and Iranian cultures, people express grief openly. They mourn out loud, while in Asian cultures, the general belief is that it is unacceptable to show emotion openly.&quot; For people in Westernized countries, laughter is a sign of amusement, but in some parts of Africa it is a sign of wonder or embarrassment.
Emotional expression varies with culture. Native Americans tend to be more reserved and less expressive with emotions. Frequent touches are common for Chinese people; however, such actions like touching, patting, hugging or kissing in America are less frequent and not often publicly displayed.According to Rebecca Bernstein (from &quot;Point Park University) &quot;Winking is a facial expression particularly varied in meaning.&quot;&quot; According to Latin culture, a wink was a display or invitation of romantic pursuit. The Yoruba (Nigeria) have taught their children to follow certain nonverbal commands, such as winking, which tells them it is time to leave the room. To the Chinese it comes off as an offensive gesture.

===Nonverbal actions===
According to Matsumoto and Juang, the nonverbal motions of different people indicate important channels of communication. Nonverbal actions should match and harmonize with the message being portrayed, otherwise confusion will occur. For instance, an individual would normally not be seen smiling and gesturing broadly when saying a sad message. The author states that nonverbal communication is very important to be aware of, especially if comparing gestures, gaze, and tone of voice amongst different cultures. As Latin American cultures embrace big speech gestures, Middle Eastern cultures are relatively more modest in public and are not expressive. Within cultures, different rules are made about staring or gazing. Women may especially avoid eye contact with men because it can be taken as a sign of sexual interest. In some cultures, gaze can be seen as a sign of respect. In Western culture, eye contact is interpreted as attentiveness and honesty. In Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Native American cultures, eye contact is thought to be disrespectful or rude, and lack of eye contact does not mean that a person is not paying attention. Voice is a category that changes within cultures. Depending on whether or not the cultures is expressive or non-expressive, many variants of the voice can depict different reactions.

The acceptable physical distance is another major difference in the nonverbal communication between cultures. In Latin America and the Middle East the acceptable distance is much shorter than what most Europeans and Americans feel comfortable with. This is why an American or a European might wonder why the other person is invading their personal space by standing so close, while the other person might wonder why the American/European is standing so far from them. In addition, for Latin Americans, the French, Italians, and Arabs the distance between people is much closer than the distance for Americans; in general for these close distance groups, 1 foot of distance is for lovers, 1.5–4 feet of distance is for family and friends, and 4–12 feet is for strangers. In the opposite way, most Native Americans value distance to protect themselves.

===Children&#x27;s learning in indigenous American communities===

Nonverbal communication is commonly used to facilitate learning in indigenous American communities. Nonverbal communication is pivotal for collaborative participation in shared activities, as children from indigenous American communities will learn how to interact using nonverbal communication by intently observing adults. Nonverbal communication allows for continuous keen observation and signals to the learner when participation is needed. Culture plays an important role in nonverbal communication, and it is one aspect that helps to influence how learning activities are organized. In many Indigenous American Communities, for example, there is often an emphasis on nonverbal communication, which acts as a valued means by which children learn. In a study on Children from both US Mexican (with presumed indigenous backgrounds) and European American heritages who watched a video of children working together without speaking found that the Mexican-heritage children were far more likely to describe the children&#x27;s actions as collaborative, saying that the children in the video were &quot;talking with their hands and with their eyes.&quot;

A key characteristic of this type of nonverbal learning is that children have the opportunity to observe and interact with all parts of an activity. Many Indigenous American children are in close contact with adults and other children who are performing the activities that they will eventually master. Objects and materials become familiar to the child as the activities are a normal part of everyday life. Learning is done in an extremely contextualized environment rather than one specifically tailored to be instructional. For example, the direct involvement that Mazahua children take in the marketplace is used as a type of interactional organization for learning without explicit verbal instruction. Children learn how to run a market stall, take part in caregiving, and also learn other basic responsibilities through non-structured activities, cooperating voluntarily within a motivational context to participate. Not explicitly instructing or guiding the children teaches them how to integrate into small coordinated groups to solve a problem through consensus and shared space. These Mazahua separate-but-together practices have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities establishes enculturation that is rooted in nonverbal social experience. As the children participate in everyday interactions, they are simultaneously learning the cultural meanings behind these interactions. Children&#x27;s experience with nonverbally organized social interaction helps constitute the process of enculturation.

In some Indigenous communities of the Americas, children reported one of their main reasons for working in their home was to build unity within the family, the same way they desire to build solidarity within their own communities. Most indigenous children learn the importance of putting in this work in the form of nonverbal communication. Evidence of this can be observed in a case study where children are guided through the task of folding a paper figure by observing the posture and gaze of those who guide them through it. This is projected onto homes and communities, as children wait for certain cues from others to initiative cooperate and collaborate.

One aspect of nonverbal communication that aids in conveying these precise and symbolic meanings is &quot;context-embeddedness.&quot; The idea that many children in Indigenous American Communities are closely involved in community endeavors, both spatially and relationally, which help to promote nonverbal communication, given that words are not always necessary. When children are closely related to the context of the endeavor as active participants, coordination is based on a shared reference, which helps to allow, maintain, and promote nonverbal communication. The idea of &quot;context-embeddedness&quot; allows nonverbal communication to be a means of learning within Native American Alaskan Athabaskans and Cherokee communities. By observing various family and community social interactions, social engagement is dominated through nonverbal communication. For example, when children elicit thoughts or words verbally to their elders, they are expected to structure their speech carefully. This demonstrates cultural humility and respect as excessive acts of speech when conversational genre shifts reveal weakness and disrespect. This careful self-censorship exemplifies traditional social interaction of Athapaskin and Cherokee Native Americans who are mostly dependent on nonverbal communication.

Nonverbal cues are used by most children in the Warm Springs Indian Reservation community within the parameters of their academic learning environments. This includes referencing Native American religion through stylized hand gestures in colloquial communication, verbal and nonverbal emotional self-containment, and less movement of the lower face to structure attention on the eyes during face-to-face engagement. Therefore, children&#x27;s approach to social situations within a reservation classroom, for example, may act as a barrier to a predominantly verbal learning environment. Most Warm Springs children benefit from a learning model that suits a nonverbal communicative structure of collaboration, traditional gesture, observational learning and shared references.

It is important to note that while nonverbal communication is more prevalent in Indigenous American Communities, verbal communication is also used. Preferably, verbal communication does not substitute one&#x27;s involvement in an activity, but instead acts as additional guidance or support towards the completion of an activity.

=== Disadvantages of purely verbal communication across cultures ===
As much of human communication is nonverbal, learning a language without learning its corresponding pragmatics can lead to miscommunication. &quot;This can lead to intercultural conflict (according to Marianna Pogosyan Ph.D.), misunderstandings and ambiguities in communication, despite language fluency.&quot; Nonverbal communication makes the difference between bringing cultures together in understanding one another, appearing authentic. Or it can push people farther away due to misunderstandings in how different groups see certain nonverbal cues or gestures. From birth, children in various cultures are taught the gestures and cues their culture defines as universal which is not the case for others, but some movements are universal. Evidence suggests that humans all smile when happy about something and frown when something is upsetting or bad.

==Genetics==
&quot;In the study of nonverbal communications, the limbic brain is where the action is...because it is the part of the brain that reacts to the world around us reflexively and instantaneously, in real time, and without thought.&quot; There is evidence that the nonverbal cues made from person-to-person do not entirely have something to do with environment.

Along with gestures, phenotypic traits can also convey certain messages in nonverbal communication, for instance, eye color, hair color and height. Research into height has generally found that taller people are perceived as being more impressive. Melamed and Bozionelos (1992) studied a sample of managers in the United Kingdom and found that height was a key factor in who was promoted. Height can have benefits and depressors too. &quot;While tall people often command more respect than short people, height can also be detrimental to some aspects of one-to-one communication, for instance, where you need to &#x27;talk on the same level&#x27; or have an &#x27;eye-to-eye&#x27; discussion with another person and do not want to be perceived as too big for your boots.&quot;

==Chronemics==
Chronemics is the way time is used. Our use of time can communicate and send messages, nonverbally. The way we use time and give or do not give our time to others can communicate different messages. Chronemics can send messages to others about what we value and also send messages about power. &quot;When you go to see someone who is in a position of power over you, such as your supervisor, it is not uncommon to be kept waiting. However, you would probably consider it bad form to make a more powerful person wait for you. Indeed, the rule seems to be that the time of powerful people is more valuable than the time of less powerful people.&quot;

=== Essential components ===
Nonverbal communication plays a crucial role in effectively transmitting messages. Beginning from birth and persisting throughout one&#x27;s life, it undergoes a developmental progression encompassing three phases, ranging from initial dyadic exchanges to the integration of both verbal and nonverbal cues. With diverse functions, nonverbal communication acts as a substitute for verbal interaction in situations where verbalization is unnecessary or impossible. It adds clarity to communication by unveiling emotional states and articulating specific feelings. This is achieved through various nonverbal elements such as emblems, illustrators, regulators, adaptors, and vocalics. This system is shaped by component including paralinguistics, kinesics, tactile communication, and proxemics, influencing social, academic, and professional contexts. Despite frequently being overlooked, nonverbal cues possess the potential to convey up to 80% of a message, especially holding significance in interactions involving prelinguistic infants and individuals facing severe disabilities. The cultural nuances of these cues underscore the necessity for interpretation, emphasizing the contextual, signaling, and interpretative dimensions.

==Movement and body position==

===Kinesics ===
Kinesics is defined as movements, more specifically the study of our movements involving our hands, body, and face. The term was coined by Ray Birdwhistell, who considered the term body language inaccurate and instead opted to explain it as nonverbal behaviors stemming from body movement. Research around this behavior provides some examples, such as someone casually smiling and leaning forward, as well as maintaining eye contact to radiate a non-dominating and intimate demeanor. In contrast, someone leaning back, a stoic facial expression, and no to little eye contact could emit an unfriendly and dominating demeanor.

Additional research expresses that eye contact is an important part of nonverbal communication involved in kinesics, as longer and appropriate levels of eye contact give an individual credibility. The opposite is said for those who do not maintain eye contact, as they are likely to be deemed distrustful. More eye contact was also found to be related to higher levels of likability and believability from those people interacted with. A real-life example of this is through service workers, in a study it was found that those workers who welcomed customers with smiles seemed like warmer individuals than those who did not smile. Customers reported that those without smiles and open body movements, such as waving or handshaking, were lacking warmth and deemed less friendly.

===Haptics: touching in communication===
Haptics is the study of touching as nonverbal communication, and haptic communication refers to how people and other animals communicate via touching.

Touches among humans that can be defined as communication include handshakes, holding hands, kissing (cheek, lips, hand), back slapping, high fives, a pat on the shoulder, and brushing an arm. Touching of oneself may include licking, picking, holding, and scratching. These behaviors are referred to as &quot;adapters&quot; or &quot;tells&quot; and may send messages that reveal the intentions or feelings of a communicator and a listener. The meaning conveyed from touch is highly dependent upon the culture, the context of the situation, the relationship between communicators, and the manner of touch.

Touch is an extremely important sense for humans; as well as providing information about surfaces and textures it is a component of nonverbal communication in interpersonal relationships, and vital in conveying physical intimacy. It can be both sexual (such as kissing) and platonic (such as hugging or tickling).

Touch is the earliest sense to develop in the fetus. Human babies have been observed to have enormous difficulty surviving if they do not possess a sense of touch, even if they retain sight and hearing. Babies who can perceive through touch, even without sight and hearing, tend to fare much better.

In chimpanzees, the sense of touch is highly developed. As newborns, they see and hear poorly but cling strongly to their mothers. Harry Harlow conducted a controversial study involving rhesus monkeys and observed that monkeys reared with a &quot;terry cloth mother,&quot; a wire feeding apparatus wrapped in soft terry cloth that provided a level of tactile stimulation and comfort, the monkey who had the real parent were considerably more emotionally stable as adults than those with a mere wire mother (Harlow, 1958).

Touching is treated differently from one country to another and socially acceptable levels of touching vary from one culture to another (Remland, 2009). In Thai culture, for example, touching someone&#x27;s head may be thought rude. Remland and Jones (1995) studied groups of people communicating and found that touching was rare among the English (8%), the French (5%) and the Dutch (4%) compared to Italians (14%) and Greeks (12.5%). Striking, pushing, pulling, pinching, kicking, strangling and hand-to-hand fighting are forms of touch in the context of physical abuse. In the &quot;Journal of Nonverbal Behavior,&quot; McDaniel et al. assessed touch as a form of communication among people from different nations under the lens of culture, relationships, and a number of body areas touched. Latin Americans are known to have a high degree of tactile activity in contrast to Asians who are considered a no-contact culture as they often steer away from public display of affection (PDA).

===Proxemics===
Proxemics is defined as the use of space as a form of communication, and includes how far or near you position yourself from others; it can be influenced by culture, race/ethnicity, gender, and age. Edward T. Hall invented the term when he realized that culture influences how people use space in communication while working with diplomats, and published his findings on proxemics in 1959 as &quot;The Silent Language&quot;. Proxemics also play a big role in business as research shows that gender and invasion of customers&#x27; privacy without previous ties negatively affect the outcome of deals. Besides, in high contact cultures, people are generally more comfortable in closer proximity, whereas individuals in low contact cultures feel more comfortable with a greater amount of personal space. Hall concluded that proxemics could cause misunderstandings between cultures as cultures use of proxemics varies and what is customary in one culture may range from being confusing to being offensive to members of a different culture.

According to Edward T. Hall, the amount of space we maintain between ourselves and the persons we communicate with shows the importance of the science of proxemics. In this process, it is seen how we feel towards others at that particular time. This resonates with proxemics and viewing it through the cultural lens, people use their space differently because of the meaning behind it as in a spectrum of cultures, ideologies differ. Within American culture, Hall defines four primary distance zones: (i) intimate (touching to eighteen inches) distance, (ii) personal (eighteen inches to four feet) distance, (iii) social (four to twelve feet) distance, and (iv) public (more than twelve feet) distance.

Intimate space is any distance less than 18 inches, and is most commonly used by individuals when they are engaging with someone with whom they feel very comfortable, such as a spouse, partner, friend, child, or parent. Personal space is a distance of 18 inches to 4 feet and is usually used when individuals are interacting with friends. Social distance is the most common type of proximity as it is used when communicating with colleagues, classmates, acquaintances, or strangers. Public distance creates the greatest gap between the individual and the audience and is categorized as distances greater than 12 feet in distance and is often used for speeches, lectures, or formal occasions.

==In relation to verbal communication==
When communicating face-to-face with someone, it is sometimes hard to differentiate which parts of conversing are communicated via verbally or non-verbally. Other studies done on the same subject have concluded that in more relaxed and natural settings of communication, verbal and non-verbal signals and cues can contribute in surprisingly similar ways. Argyle, using video tapes shown to the subjects, analysed the communication of submissive/dominant attitude, (high and low context, high context resorting to more strict social classes and take a more short and quick response route to portray dominance, low context being the opposite by taking time to explain everything and putting a lot of importance on communication and building trust and respect with others in a submissive and relaxed manner), and found that non-verbal cues had 4.3 times the effect of verbal cues. The most important effect was that body posture communicated superior status (specific to culture and context said person grew up in) in a very efficient way. On the other hand, a study by Hsee et al. had subjects judge a person on the dimension happy/sad and found that words spoken with minimal variation in intonation had an impact about 4 times larger than face expressions seen in a film without sound. Therefore, when considering certain non-verbal mannerisms such as facial expressions and physical cues, they can conflict in meaning when compared to spoken language and emotions. Different set ups and scenarios would yield different responses and meanings when using both types of communication. In other ways they can complement each other, provided they are used together wisely during a conversation.

When seeking to communicate effectively, it is important that the nonverbal conversation supports the verbal conversation, and vice versa. If the nonverbal cues converge with what we are saying verbally, then our message is further reinforced. Mindfulness is one technique that can help improve our awareness of NVC. If we become more mindful and present to how our body is moving, then we can better control our external nonverbal communication, which results in more effective communication.

===Interaction===
During communication, nonverbal messages can interact with verbal messages in six ways: repeating, conflicting, complementing, substituting, regulating and accenting/moderating.

====Conflicting====
Conflicting verbal and nonverbal messages within the same interaction can sometimes send opposing or conflicting messages. A person verbally expressing a statement of truth while simultaneously fidgeting or avoiding eye contact may convey a mixed message to the receiver in the interaction. Conflicting messages may occur for a variety of reasons often stemming from feelings of uncertainty, ambivalence, or frustration. When mixed messages occur, nonverbal communication becomes the primary tool people use to attain additional information to clarify the situation; great attention is placed on bodily movements and positioning when people perceive mixed messages during interactions. Definitions of nonverbal communication creates a limited picture in our minds but there are ways to create a clearer one. There are different dimensions of verbal and nonverbal communication that have been discovered. They are (1) structure versus non-structure, (2) linguistic versus non-linguistic, (3) continuous versus discontinuous, (4) learned versus innate, and (5) left versus right hemispheric processing.

====Complementing====
Accurate interpretation of messages is made easier when nonverbal and verbal communication complement each other. Nonverbal cues can be used to elaborate on verbal messages to reinforce the information sent when trying to achieve communicative goals; messages have been shown to be remembered better when nonverbal signals affirm the verbal exchange.

====Substituting====
Nonverbal behavior is sometimes used as the sole channel for communication of a message. People learn to identify facial expressions, body movements, and body positioning as corresponding with specific feelings and intentions. Nonverbal signals can be used without verbal communication to convey messages; when nonverbal behavior does not effectively communicate a message, verbal methods are used to enhance understanding.

====Structure versus non-structure====
Verbal communication is a highly structured form of communication with set rules of grammar. The rules of verbal communication help to understand and make sense of what other people are saying. For example, foreigners learning a new language can have a hard time making themselves understood. On the other hand, nonverbal communication has no formal structure when it comes to communicating. Nonverbal communication occurs without even thinking about it. The same behavior can mean different things, such as crying of sadness or of joy. Therefore, these cues need to be interpreted carefully to get their correct meaning.

====Linguistic versus non-linguistic====
There are only a few assigned symbols in the system of nonverbal communication. Nodding the head is one symbol that indicates agreement in some cultures, but in others, it means disagreement. On the other hand, verbal communication has a system of symbols that have specific meanings to them.

====Continuous and discontinuous====
Verbal communication is based on discontinuous units whereas nonverbal communication is continuous. Communicating nonverbally cannot be stopped unless one would leave the room, but even then, the intrapersonal processes still take place (individuals communicating with themselves). Without the presence of someone else, the body still manages to undergo nonverbal communication. For example, there are no other words being spoken after a heated debate, but there are still angry faces and cold stares being distributed. This is an example of how nonverbal communication is continuous.

====Learned versus innate====
Learned non-verbal cues require a community or culture for their reinforcement. For example, table manners are not innate capabilities upon birth. Dress code is a non-verbal cue that must be established by society. Hand symbols, whose interpretation can vary from culture to culture, are not innate nonverbal cues. Learned cues must be gradually reinforced by admonition or positive feedback.

Innate non-verbal cues are &quot;built-in&quot; features of human behavior. Generally, these innate cues are universally prevalent and regardless of culture. For example, smiling, crying, and laughing do not require teaching. Similarly, some body positions, such as the fetal position, are universally associated with weakness. Due to their universality, the ability to comprehend these cues is not limited to individual cultures.

====Left versus right-hemispheric processing====
This type of processing involves the neurophysiological approach to nonverbal communication. It explains that the right hemisphere processes nonverbal stimuli such as those involving spatial, pictorial, and gestalt tasks while the left hemisphere involves the verbal stimuli involving analytical and reasoning tasks. It is important to know the implications in processing the differences between verbal and nonverbal communication messages. It is possible that individuals may not use the correct hemisphere at appropriate times when it comes to interpreting a message or meaning.

==Clinical studies==
=== Principles===
From 1977 to 2004, the influence of disease and drugs on receptivity of nonverbal communication was studied by teams at three separate medical schools using a similar paradigm. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, Yale University and Ohio State University had subjects observe gamblers at a slot machine awaiting payoffs. The amount of this payoff was read by nonverbal transmission prior to reinforcement. This technique was developed by and the studies directed by psychologist Robert E. Miller and psychiatrist A. James Giannini. These groups reported diminished receptive ability in heroin addicts and phencyclidine abusers, contrasted with increased receptivity in cocaine addicts. Men with major depression manifested significantly decreased ability to read nonverbal cues when compared with euthymic men.

In some subjects tested for ability to read nonverbal cues, intuitive paradigms were apparently employed while in others a cause and effect approach was used. Subjects in the former group answered quickly and before reinforcement occurred. They could not give a rationale for their particular responses. Subjects in the latter category delayed their response and could offer reasons for their choice. The level of accuracy between the two groups did not vary nor did handedness.

Obese women and women with premenstrual syndrome were found to also possess diminished abilities to read these cues. In contradistinction, men with bipolar disorder possessed increased abilities. A woman with total paralysis of the nerves of facial expression was found unable to transmit or receive any nonverbal facial cues whatsoever. Because of the changes in levels of accuracy on the levels of nonverbal receptivity, the members of the research team hypothesized a biochemical site in the brain which was operative for reception of nonverbal cues. Because certain drugs enhanced ability while others diminished it, the neurotransmitters dopamine and endorphin were considered to be likely etiological candidate. Based on the available data, however, the primary cause and primary effect could not be sorted out on the basis of the paradigm employed.

===Child comprehension===
An increased emphasis on gestures exists when intonations or facial expression are used. &quot;Speakers often anticipate how recipients will interpret their utterances. If they wish some other, less obvious interpretation, they may &quot;mark&quot; their utterance (e.g. with special intonations or facial expressions).&quot; This specific emphasis known as &#x27;marking&#x27; can be spotted as a learned form of non-verbal communication in toddlers. A groundbreaking study from Carpenter et al. in the &quot;Journal of Child Language&quot; has concluded that the act of marking a gesture is recognized by three-year-olds but not by two-year-olds.

In the study, two and three-year-old toddlers were tested on their recognition of markedness within gestures. The experiment was conducted in a room with an examiner and the test subjects, which for the first study were three-year-olds. The examiner sat across from each child individually, and allowed them to play with various objects including a purse with a sponge in it and a box with a sponge in it. After allowing the child to play with the objects for three minutes, the examiner told the child it was time to clean up and motioned by pointing to the objects. They measured the responses of the children by first pointing and not marking the gesture, to see the child&#x27;s reaction to the request and if they reached for the objects to clean them up. After observing the child&#x27;s response, the examiner then asked and pointed again, marking the gesture with facial expression, as to lead the child to believe the objects were supposed to be cleaned up. The results showed that three-year-old children were able to recognize the markedness, by responding to the gesture and cleaning the objects up as opposed to when the gesture was presented without being marked.

In the second study in which the same experiment was performed on two-year-olds, the results were different. For the most part, the children did not recognize the difference between the marked and unmarked gesture by not responding more prevalently to the marked gesture, unlike the results of the three-year-olds. This shows that this sort of nonverbal communication is learned at a young age, and is better recognized in three-year-old children than two-year-old children, making it easier for us to interpret that the ability to recognize markedness is learned in the early stages of development, somewhere between three and four years of age.

Boone and Cunningham conducted a study to determine at which age children begin to recognize emotional meaning (happiness, sadness, anger and fear) in expressive body movements. The study included 29 adults and 79 children divided into age groups of four-, five- and eight-year-olds. The children were shown two clips simultaneously and were asked to point to the one that was expressing the target emotion. The results of the study revealed that of the four emotions being tested the 4-year-olds were only able to correctly identify sadness at a rate that was better than chance. The 5-year-olds performed better and were able to identify happiness, sadness and fear at better than chance levels. The 8-year-olds and adults could correctly identify all four emotions and there was very little difference between the scores of the two groups. Between the ages of 4 and 8, nonverbal communication and decoding skills improve dramatically.

===Comprehension of nonverbal facial cues===
A byproduct of the work of the Pittsburgh/Yale/Ohio State team was an investigation of the role of nonverbal facial cues in heterosexual nondate rape. Males who were serial rapists of adult women were studied for nonverbal receptive abilities. Their scores were the highest of any subgroup. Rape victims were next tested. It was reported that women who had been raped on at least two occasions by different perpetrators had a highly significant impairment in their abilities to read these cues in either male or female senders. These results were troubling, indicating a predator-prey model. The authors did note that whatever the nature of these preliminary findings the responsibility of the rapist was in no manner or level diminished.

The final target of study for this group was the medical students they taught. Medical students at Ohio State University, Ohio University and Northeast Ohio Medical College were invited to serve as subjects. Students indicating a preference for the specialties of family practice, psychiatry, pediatrics and obstetrics-gynecology achieved significantly higher levels of accuracy than those students who planned to train as surgeons, radiologists, or pathologists. Internal medicine and plastic surgery candidates scored at levels near the mean.

<doc id="566666" wikidata="Q92832" url="?curid=566666" title="Peter Norvig">
<text>Peter Norvig (born December 14, 1956) is an American computer scientist and Distinguished Education Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. He previously served as a director of research and search quality at Google. Norvig is the co-author with Stuart J. Russell of the most popular textbook in the field of AI: &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot; used in more than 1,500 universities in 135 countries.

==Early life and education==
Norvig grew up in an academic family. His father was Danish and came to the United States after World War II to study math at the University of Minnesota. Norvig received a Bachelor of Science in applied mathematics from Brown University and a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley.

==Career and research==
Norvig is a councilor of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and co-author, with Stuart J. Russell, of &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot;, now the leading college text in the field. He was head of the Computational Sciences Division (now the Intelligent Systems Division) at NASA Ames Research Center, where he oversaw a staff of 200 scientists performing NASA&#x27;s research and development in autonomy and robotics, automated software engineering and data analysis, neuroengineering, collaborative systems research, and simulation-based decision-making. Before that he was chief scientist at Junglee, where he helped develop one of the first Internet comparison-shopping services; chief designer at Harlequin Inc.; and senior scientist at Sun Microsystems Laboratories.

Norvig has served as an assistant professor at the University of Southern California and as a research faculty member at Berkeley. He has over fifty publications in various areas of computer science, concentrating on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, information retrieval and software engineering, including the books &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot;, &quot;Paradigms of AI Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp&quot;, &quot;Verbmobil: A Translation System for Face-to-Face Dialog&quot;, and &quot;Intelligent Help Systems for UNIX&quot;.

Norvig is one of the creators of JScheme. Norvig is listed under &quot;Academic Faculty &amp; Advisors&quot; for the Singularity University. In 2011, Norvig worked with Sebastian Thrun to develop a popular online course in Artificial Intelligence that had more than 160,000 students enrolled. He also teaches an online course via the Udacity platform.

==Selected publications and presentations==
By 2022, &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot;, which Norvig first co-authored with Stuart J. Russell in 1995, was the leading textbook in the field used by over 1400 schools globally.

In 2001, Norvig published a short article titled &quot;Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years&quot;, arguing against the fashionable introductory programming textbooks that purported to teach programming in days or weeks. The article was widely shared and discussed, and has attracted contributed translations to over 20 languages.

Norvig is also known for his 2003 &quot;Gettysburg Powerpoint Presentation&quot;, a satire about bad presentation practices using Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s famous Gettysburg Address.

His 2009 IEEE Intelligent Systems article, &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data&quot; co-authored with Alon Y. Halevy and Fernando Pereira, described how the best approach to highly complex natural language understanding problems is to harness large quantities of data, not to depend on &quot;tidy&quot;, simple formulas. They said that by generating &quot;large amounts of unlabeled, noisy data, new algorithms can be used to build high-quality models from the data. This has informed the development of foundation models. &quot;But invariably, simple models and a lot of data trump more elaborate models based on less data.&quot; &quot;Choose a representation that can use unsupervised learning on unlabeled data, which is so much more plentiful than labeled data.&quot; The title refers to the physicist Eugene Wigner&#x27;s 1960 journal article, &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences&quot;.

In a 23 September 2010 lecture presented as part of the Vancouver-based University of British Columbia&#x27;s Department of Computer Science&#x27;s Distinguished Lecture Series, Norvig, who was then the Director of Research at Google, described how large quantities of data deepen our understanding of phenomena.

In his June 2012 Ted Talk, described the fall of 2011 hybrid class on artificial intelligence attended by 100,000 online students around the globe that he co-taught with Sebastian Thrun at Stanford University.

===Awards and honors===
Norvig was elected an AAAI Fellow in 2001 and a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in 2006.

<doc id="566667" wikidata="Q973040" url="?curid=566667" title="Out of the Blue (Electric Light Orchestra album)">
<text>Out of the Blue is the seventh studio album by the British rock group Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), released on 24 October 1977 in the United States and four days after in the UK on 28 October. Written and produced by ELO frontman Jeff Lynne, the double album is among the most commercially successful records in the group&#x27;s history, selling about 10 million copies worldwide by 2007.

==Recording==
Jeff Lynne wrote the entire album in three and a half weeks after a sudden burst of creativity while hidden away in his rented chalet in the Swiss Alps. It took a further two months to record in Munich.

==Content==

&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was one of the first pop albums to have an extensive use of the vocoder, and helped to popularize it.

===Side 1===

The opening track, &quot;Turn To Stone&quot;, was described by Donald A. Guarisco as &quot;a good example of Electric Light Orchestra&#x27;s skill for mixing string-laden pop hooks with driving rock and roll&quot;, praising the &quot;array of swirling string lines that dart in and out of the mix and some dazzling falsetto harmonies that interact with Lynne&#x27;s lead vocal in call and response style&quot;. The song features a &quot;tongue-twister section&quot; where the song &quot;stops dead&quot;, leaving only &quot;slightly phased&quot; vocals punctuated by Bev Bevan&#x27;s drum hits.

The following track is &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;, which takes on what &quot;Billboard&quot; described as a &quot;classical feel&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it begins &quot;with simple chording which opens to a strumming beat&quot; and that the &quot;strings add panorama&quot; and that &quot;the vocals are characteristically crystalline and soaring.&quot;

&quot;Sweet Talkin&#x27; Woman&quot; serves as the band&#x27;s &quot;first real step into the disco sound [...] a string-laden pop tune whose dance-friendly edge helped it become a disco-era hit&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Donald A. Guarisco attributed its disco sound to &quot;Bev Bevan&#x27;s steady drum work&quot; and &quot;pounding piano lines, delirous bursts of swirling strings, and endlessly overdubbed backing vocals [that] mesh seamlessly to form an ornate but driving funhouse of pop hooks&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the song as a &quot;catchy rocker characterized by semi-classical elements.&quot;

&quot;Across the Border&quot; begins with the same &quot;clanging train&quot; sound effect used on the ABBA song &quot;Nina, Pretty Ballerina&quot; and a violin solo by Mik Kaminski. The song itself takes on a &quot;Mexico-infused&quot; style with a verse melody reminiscent of the Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, and Lynne and Groucutt singing in harmony in a &quot;staccato&quot; vocal style.

===Side 2===

Side 2 begins with &quot;Night in the City&quot;, which &quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Brian Kachejian rated as ELO&#x27;s 5th greatest song. Kachejian said that &quot;the song’s chorus and verses, bridge, innovative introductions and ending made for one fun ride.&quot; The song begins with an unusual segment where keyboardist Richard Tandy&#x27;s keyboards emulate &quot;the noise and cacophony of busy traffic&quot;, combined with &quot;frenzied&quot; string sections invoking &quot;the oppressive atmosphere of being trapped in a city that never sleeps&quot;.

The song &quot;Starlight&quot; was inspired by &quot;the night stars in the mountains of Switzerland&quot;. ELO drummer Bev Bevan said that the song was &quot;meant to have a rhythm and blues feeling to it ... something like Al Green.&quot; ELO historian Barry Delve describes the song as having a &quot;dreamy night-time vibe&quot;.

&quot;Jungle&quot; takes a stylistic left turn, featuring &quot;Tarzan effects, trumpeting elephants, a talking lion, and a Terpsichorean interlude&quot; that Delve describes as part of the song&#x27;s &quot;unashamed goofiness&quot;. The song is divisive among fans, with some seeing it as &quot;an unworthy novelty&quot;.

&quot;Believe Me Now&quot; is a short, &quot;dramatic&quot; interlude dominated by piano, orchestra, and vocoder that serves as an introduction to the following song. &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; is a &quot;tender ballad&quot; with lyrics about leaving home. In the final two minutes, the previously stripped-back arrangement is augmented with increasingly large layers of guitars and vocal harmonies, building to a &quot;grand finish&quot;. Lynne has said that he regrets his original vocal take on the released song, saying in 2015 &quot;I really messed up the original on &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. ... It&#x27;s just so flimsy.&quot;

===Side 3===

Side three of the release is subtitled &quot;Concerto for a Rainy Day&quot;, a four-track musical suite with common themes of the weather, inspired by the &quot;relentless rain&quot; Lynne experienced in Switzerland while writing the album. Rain and thunder sound effects, recorded in Munich during the recording of the album, appear at the beginning of the suite, and between each song.

&quot;Standin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; opens the suite with a simple, &quot;nursery rhyme-like tune&quot; and quiet, distant weather sounds. After a cymbal crash, the orchestra takes prominence, and a heavily distorted voice, manipulated to resemble thunder crackling, voices the words &quot;A concerto for a rainy day&quot;. From this point, the song develops into an &quot;exhilarating instrumental workout&quot; that evokes the intensity of a rainstorm.

&quot;Big Wheels&quot; forms the second part of the suite. The song adds layers of instrumentation as it progresses, building from an intimate beginning towards an &quot;epic&quot; crescendo. In the intro of the song, a vocoder sings a melody that reappears in orchestral form at the end of the last song in the suite, &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot;. Apart from its inclusion on the &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; album, the song has never appeared on any of the band&#x27;s compilations or as a B-side until 2000, when Lynne included it on the group&#x27;s retrospective &quot;Flashback&quot; album.

&quot;Summer and Lightning&quot; is the third song in the suite, and takes on a more lively atmosphere. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Mark Beaumont praised the song, ranking it as one of the band&#x27;s best ten songs.

The suite concludes with &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot;, a lively, optimistic song celebrating sunshine. Jeff Lynne has told the story of how he wrote the song:

The arrangement has a prominent cowbell-like sound, and at the end of the song, a vocoder sings &quot;please turn me over&quot;, an instruction to physically turn the vinyl over to listen to the final side. The song was released as the album&#x27;s second UK single in 1978. It was also released in other countries and territories, some of which removed the final outro with the vocoder.

===Side 4===
Mark Beaumont said that the first track on Side 4, &quot;Sweet Is the Night&quot;, &quot;[sweeps] from an elegant glam-funk strut to a chorus that [is] essentially All The Young Dudes base-jumping.&quot; Lynne and Groucutt share singing duties again, with lyrics that Delve describes as &quot;the only love song [on the album] with a happy ending&quot;.

&quot;The Whale&quot; is an instrumental track that begins with a &quot;flurry of aquatic, atmospheric effects&quot;, and uses the stereo soundscape greatly to &quot;convey the ocean&#x27;s space and expanse.&quot; Lynne wrote the song after watching a TV episode about the hunting of whales, and a part of the proceeds from &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; were donated to environmental advocacy group Greenpeace. ELO historian Barry Delve praised the song, calling it a &quot;a great one to listen to in headphones&quot;, though Mark Beaumont was more critical, naming its &quot;lumbering, ambient depths&quot; as one of the worst moments of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, alongside a &quot;shonky side two&quot;.

&quot;Birmingham Blues&quot; is a bluesy rock tune with lyrics about life as a touring band and homesickness.

The album closer is &quot;Wild West Hero&quot;, which features &quot;yearning&quot; lyrics as well as many tempo and stylistic changes across its runtime. Mark Beaumont described it as &quot;&#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; on horseback&quot;. The song was released as the third single from the album, and reached a peak position of number 6.

==Cover art==
The large spaceship on the album&#x27;s cover (by then symbolic of the group) was designed by Kosh with art by Shusei Nagaoka. It was based on the logo Kosh designed for ELO&#x27;s previous album, &quot;A New World Record&quot;, and looks like the space station with a docking shuttle from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). The number JTLA 823 L2 which is featured on the shuttle arriving at the space station is the original catalogue number for the album. The album also included an insert of a cardboard cutout of the space station as well as a fold-out poster of the band members. The space theme was carried onto the live stage in the form of a huge glowing flying saucer stage set, inside which the band performed.

==Release==
&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was successful upon release, reaching No.4 in both the US and UK charts, as well as No.3 in Australia and No.2 in Sweden. The album spawned five hit singles in different countries, and was ELO&#x27;s most commercially successful studio album. It was also the first double album in the history of the UK music charts to generate four top twenty hit singles. Lynne considers &quot;A New World Record&quot; and &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; to be the group&#x27;s crowning achievements, and both sold extremely well, reaching multi-platinum according to RIAA Certification. Capital Radio and The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; Rock and Pop Awards (forerunner to The Brit Awards) named it &quot;Album of the Year&quot; in 1978. Lynne received his first Ivor Novello award for Outstanding Contributions to British Music the same year.

The US release of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was originally distributed by United Artists. This changed after United Artists Records was sold by Transamerica Corporation to an EMI Records-backed partnership, which triggered Jet Records&#x27; change of control clause in its distribution contract, and Jet shifted to CBS Records as its new distributor. American cut-out copies of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; soon became widely available at discounted prices in record shops in the US and Canada shortly after the album&#x27;s release, affecting the album&#x27;s sales and triggering lawsuits by CBS and Jet. The suits were ultimately unsuccessful in stopping the discounted sales.

===Reissues===
The 30th Anniversary Edition was released in February 2007 with three bonus tracks, as part of the Sony/BMG Music Epic/Legacy series. The 30th anniversary issue was a limited pressing in hardback book with expanded 24-page full colour booklet. It includes full-length sleeve notes by Lynne and ELO archivist Rob Caiger, as well as rare photos and memorabilia. A push-out replica ELO Space Station is included as well as the standard jewel case edition with a full colour 12-page edited booklet. The album once again reached the top twenty album charts in the UK peaking at number 18. A sixth single &quot;Latitude 88 North&quot; was released as digital download single and as a promo 7&quot; single.

In 2012, Music on Vinyl re-released &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; on vinyl on Epic; the first 1,000 copies were made on transparent blue vinyl and the rest were released in the standard black vinyl.

In 2017, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the album, a double picture vinyl disc was released by Sony Music and Epic Records.

==Reception and legacy==

With a four out of 5 stars rating Jim Evans of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; called Out of the Blue &quot;almost a masterpiece and easily one of the best albums this year. And to better &#x27;A New World Record&#x27; is a great achievement.&quot; Billy Altman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that the album was &quot;meticulously produced and performed&quot; and showed the influence of the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Bee Gees. However, he detected a lack of passion in the work, which he dismissed as a &quot;totally uninteresting and horrifyingly sterile package&quot; and &quot;All method and no madness: perfectly hollow and bland rock Muzak.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Altman/RS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years a more favourable view has developed. Ian Gittens of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, who gave a 3 out of 5 stars rating, found that &quot;this baroque double album has aged better than the three-chord wonders who derided it.&quot; He added &quot;Out of the Blue could have managed without the four-song &quot;suite&quot;, Concerto for a Rainy Day, but beneath the lavish over-production tracks like Sweet Talkin&#x27; Woman, Turn to Stone and Mr Blue Sky were simply great pop songs.&quot; With an 8.1/10 score in a 2007 review Rob Mitchum of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote &quot;Calling in the string section and commissioning the spaceship cover-art may be a big gamble, but &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; is proof of how good it can sound when the grand approach works.&quot; Dan MacIntosh of &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave a 7/10 score saying &quot;Even with all the excessive rock trappings inherent during ELO’s era, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; nevertheless stands up well as a creative endeavor. Best of all, it has the undiminished ability to break through the clouds with plenty of “Mr. Blue Sky” joy — even now.&quot; Chris Jones of the BBC said that &quot;&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; remains an essential purchase for anyone wishing to bask in their pop perfection.&quot;

In 2000, it was voted number 346 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Axl Rose – by his own admission &quot;an old ELO fanatic&quot; – said: &quot;&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; is an awesome record.&quot;

In October 2013, the album was ranked 23rd on VH1&#x27;s list &quot;Double Trouble: The 35 Best-Selling Double Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="566670" wikidata="Q53025" url="?curid=566670" title="Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party">
<text>The Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP) is a social-democratic political party in Gibraltar. The GSLP is the oldest surviving active political party in Gibraltar. Its roots are based in the trade union movement, as its founder and former leader Joe Bossano was the District Officer of the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU). The party has been led since 2011 by Fabian Picardo, who has served as Chief Minister of Gibraltar since the 2011 general election. The GSLP forms the GSLP–Liberal Alliance in partnership with the Liberal Party of Gibraltar.

==History==
The TGWU during Bossano&#x27;s tenure was instrumental in achieving parity with the United Kingdom for all workers in Gibraltar. Bossano left the Integration with Britain Party in 1975 and founded the Gibraltar Democratic Movement (GDM), which contested the 1976 election winning four seats in the House of Assembly. The GDM became the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party in 1978 and obtained one seat, that of Bossano, in the 1980 election. At the elections of 1984, the GSLP capitalized on the Gibraltarian discontent about the way the British Government was handling the future of the Gibraltar Royal Navy dockyard, opposing the transfer of the docks to Appledore International (which involved the loss of about 400 jobs), and winning seven of the fifteen seats of the Assembly. The party was eventually in Government from 1988 to 1996.

In April 2011, Joe Bossano retired as party leader and he was replaced by Fabian Picardo.

==Ideology and policy==

Like all the other parties in Gibraltar, the GSLP supports self-determination for Gibraltar and opposes any moves toward joint British–Spanish sovereignty. The party has strong member and personal ties with the UK Labour Party with many prominent members having been involved with the Labour Party while in the United Kingdom. The GSLP also endorsed the Labour Party at the 2014 European Parliament elections as it had done on previous European elections.

The party strongly supports Gibraltar&#x27;s territorial integrity, in particular seeks pursuit of the recognition of the full twelve-mile limit to Gibraltar territorial waters, as is the case with other British overseas territories, and it considers Spain&#x27;s violations of the current three-mile limit of territorial waters as &quot;a hostile and unfriendly act&quot;.

The party does not consider Gibraltar to have been decolonised by the Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006 and has a policy of continued participation at all United Nations venues in which Gibraltar is discussed including the Special Committee on Decolonization until the decolonisation of Gibraltar is recognised by the UN and the achievement of a new international status for Gibraltar as a full self-governing territory under the British Crown.

==Elections==

In the 1980 election to the Gibraltar House of Assembly, the party won its first seat in the House.

In the 1984 election, the party won 34.2% of the popular vote and 7 seats.

In the 1988 election, the party won 58.2% of the popular vote and 8 seats to form the new government.

In the 1992 election, the party won 73.1%% of the popular vote and 8 seats.

In the 1996 election, the party won 42.95% of the popular vote and 7 seats.

In the 1999 by-election following the death of GSLP Opposition MP Robert Mor, Liberal Party leader Dr. Joseph Garcia (backed by the GSLP) won 51.46% of the popular vote and the seat. He was the first joint GSLP/Liberal candidate to contest an election.

In the 2000 election, the party won (in alliance with the Liberals) 25.62% of the popular vote and 5 seats.

In the 2003 election, the party won (in Alliance with the Liberals) 25.08% of the popular vote and 5 seats.

In the 2007 election to the newly named (and re-organized) Gibraltar Parliament, the party won (in Alliance with the Liberals) 31.84% of the popular vote and 4 seats.

In the 2011 election, the party won (in Alliance with the Liberals) 34.23% of the popular vote and 7 seats and, with the 3 seats won by the Liberal Party, formed the new Government of Gibraltar.

In the 2013 by-election, following the death of Housing Minister Charles Bruzon (GSLP), the GSLP candidate Albert Isola won 49.84% of the popular vote to fill in the vacant seat.

In the 2015 election, the party won (in Alliance with the Liberals) 47.83% of the popular vote and 7 seats.

The GSLP was represented in the European Parliament by Glyn Ford MEP of the PES Group during the 6th European Parliament term, however Ford later lost his seat in the 2009 European elections.

The GSLP supported and endorsed the UK Labour Party during elections to the European Parliament.

<text>Something Corporate (also known as SoCo) is an American rock band from Laguna Niguel, Orange County, California, formed in 1998. Their currently active line-up includes vocalist and pianist Andrew McMahon, guitarists Josh Partington and William Tell, bassist Kevin Page and drummer Brian Ireland.

Following their formation, Something Corporate recorded demos that were eventually released as an independent, studio album entitled &quot;Ready... Break&quot;. Soon after, they were signed to MCA Records but were released under the Drive-Thru Records banner for their debut EP &quot;Audioboxer&quot;. Their first single, &quot;If You C Jordan&quot;, was their most successful, peaking at number 29 on the Alternative Songs chart. Their first album released through the major label was &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; (2002) which premiered at Number 1/Hot Shot Debut on the Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers&quot; chart on June 8, 2002 and eventually peaked at number 101 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Something Corporate went on hiatus in 2004 and no longer had any recording contracts with their record labels. During the hiatus, McMahon found success in his side-project, Jack&#x27;s Mannequin. Something Corporate briefly reunited in October 2006 (at a Jack&#x27;s Mannequin show) to play a short set. In December 2009, Something Corporate officially announced their reunion to tour in 2010 and released a greatest hits album. McMahon announced during an August 3, 2010, visit to Milwaukee that the band had collectively sold over 1 million total records in the band&#x27;s ten years of existence. On September 9, 2022 the band reunited to play a surprise show for McMahon’s 40th birthday at House of Blues in Anaheim, California.

The band re-united its core line-up to play When We Were Young Festival in 2023 (and a headlining show at House of Blues Las Vegas), hosted a New Years Eve show in Anaheim, CA on December 30 and 31, 2023, and will be touring the Summer of 2024 as well as performing on the &quot;Andrew McMahon&#x27;s Holiday from Real Cruise&quot; in November of 2024.

== History ==

===Formation and early releases (1998–2002)===
Andrew McMahon and Brian Ireland had a class together at Dana Hills High School, during which the pair often talked about music. Ireland received a drum set for Christmas, and the pair subsequently started a band with bassist Kevin &quot;Clutch&quot; Page. The group, known as Left Here, was formed for a Battle of the Bands contest. Despite winning, they ended up breaking up shortly afterwards. In September 1998, McMahon, Page, and Ireland, merged with lead guitarist Josh Partington and rhythm guitarist Reuben Hernandez, to form Something Corporate. Following a few shows, McMahon realized that he would be unable to pursue a career in music if he continued his education. McMahon&#x27;s parents were supportive of his music, but suggested doing college applications if the band didn&#x27;t work out within a year. The group were unable to secure gigs due to being underage outside of parties and various Battle of the Bands competitions. During this time, the group shared an apartment in Dana Point, where McMahon and Hernandez wrote a number of the band&#x27;s early material.

Throughout high school the band tried to play at local venue the Coach House, which was owned by Gary Folgner. He kept declining the band&#x27;s offers as they didn&#x27;t have any releases out. However, when Folgner saw the band live, he gave them money to record their debut album &quot;Ready... Break&quot; at the Coach House and Galaxy Theater. The band released &quot;Ready... Break&quot; in November 2000. On March 27, 2001, Something Corporate announced an official change to the band&#x27;s lineup; Hernandez left to pursue college and was replaced by William Tell. The band signed with MCA Records and Drive-Thru Records and released the band&#x27;s official debut, an EP titled &quot;Audioboxer&quot; (2001). It was promoted nationwide through tours, in-store performances at Tower Records stores and a television appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot; on February 25, 2002. The EP featured the single &quot;iF yoU C Jordan&quot;, with its music video starring &quot;American Pie&#x27;s&quot; Chris Owen.

===Debut album and follow-up (2002–2004)===
In May 2002, Something Corporate released their debut major label album, &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot;. It contained the singles &quot;I Woke Up in a Car&quot; and &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot;. The album hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart and number 101 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Something Corporate released a half-hour home video on DVD, titled &quot;A Year in the Life&quot; in November 2002. Furthermore, they released the B-sides compilation EP &quot;Songs for Silent Movies&quot;, only available in Japan.

In October 2003, Something Corporate released their second full-length record, &quot;North&quot;. The album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200. They launched the album with an appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, performing the songs &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; and &quot;Space&quot;, the latter of which became the only single from the album. In February 2004, it was confirmed that William Tell had left Something Corporate to pursue a solo career. Bobby &quot;Raw&quot; Anderson, formerly of the band River City High, became Tell&#x27;s replacement. Ireland assisted Tell in the recording of his debut album, &quot;You Can Hold Me Down&quot;. Ireland has several credits on the album, including drums, programming, and background vocals. Ireland also toured and performed live as part of Tell&#x27;s band. On May 20, 2004, Something Corporate filmed its concert at the Ventura Theater in Ventura, California. The footage was released as the band&#x27;s second DVD, &quot;Live at the Ventura Theater&quot;, on November 9. The band supported its release with a short two-week college tour in November.

===Hiatus (2004–2009)===
In summer 2004, the band grew exhausted from spending years on the road and decided to take a break. The band promised the break would not be a permanent one in a 2005 interview with &quot;Concert Pipeline&quot;. McMahon said &quot;I think for all of us it just got to the point where we were like &#x27;Let&#x27;s just go be our own people for a minute&#x27;-- not out of a desire to leave the band or break up Something Corporate-- quite the opposite. Let&#x27;s reconnect with all the things that spawned the band in the first place.&quot; In January and February 2005, the band toured across the U.S. alongside Straylight Run, Hidden in Plain View, The Academy Is..., and Armor for Sleep. In April, 2005 the band played an outdoor concert at Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity at Indiana University as part of Little 500 festivities.

During the hiatus, McMahon formed a side project named Jack&#x27;s Mannequin. The band released an album entitled &quot;Everything in Transit&quot; in August 2005. The day that recording for the album was completed, McMahon was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He has since gone into remission. In 2008, McMahon released a second album with Jack&#x27;s Mannequin, &quot;The Glass Passenger&quot;. The album debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200, surpassing the success he achieved with Something Corporate. Partington also formed the band Firescape, who released an EP, &quot;Rearden&#x27;s Conscience&quot;, and studio album, &quot;Dancehall Apocolypse&quot;. In 2006, Ireland joined the Louisiana-based band Streamline as their drummer. He wrote two songs (&quot;Let Go&quot; and &quot;Anything&quot;) for Streamline&#x27;s 2009 EP, &quot;The Alchemist and the Arsonist,&quot; but left the band in November 2009. Ireland formed the band Live Oak Revue with his brothers, Derek and Matt Ireland, and friend Zak Salazar and released the EP, &quot;When the Dawn Breaks&quot;, on June 21, 2011. McMahon is featured on the track &quot;Sinner&#x27;s Heart.&quot;

In December 2005, the band announced they would re-group in January 2006 for rehearsals and plan to write their third album. In July 2006, McMahon said the group&#x27;s hiatus wouldn&#x27;t be permanent, and that they talked of touring early-to-mid 2007 and enter the studio after McMahon was finished working on the second Jack&#x27;s Mannequin album. In October 2006, Something Corporate reunited to perform three songs; &quot;Konstantine&quot;, &quot;I Woke Up in a Car&quot; and &quot;Hurricane&quot;. They played at the end of McMahon&#x27;s set with Jack&#x27;s Mannequin at the Bamboozle Left festival. In December 2007, McMahon said that Something Corporate&#x27;s status as a band could be described as is in &quot;suspended animation&quot;. He told &quot;Alternative Press&quot; that he is more &quot;nostalgically charged&quot; than &quot;creatively charged&quot; to make another Something Corporate record.

In a February 2009 interview with Lansing State Journal, Andrew McMahon discussed the future of Something Corporate. He said, &quot;As for releasing a full-length with a tour in the classic sense, I don&#x27;t see that happening. But we&#x27;re all great friends, and I do see us putting together new material and hitting the road. The fans have been so supportive and such a huge part of our lives that I would feel horrible not to at least give them something.&quot;

===Reunions (2010, 2016, 2022–current)===

On December 3, 2009, it was announced that they would be playing the Bamboozle Left Festival in Anaheim, California on March 28, 2010. On February 22 at the House of Blues in Chicago, Andrew McMahon announced that Something Corporate will be at Bamboozle Chicago on May 15.
On March 29, 2010, AbsolutePunk.net reported that Something Corporate will also be playing Bamboozle Right in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on May 1.

In February 2010, Andrew McMahon announced that Something Corporate was planning a greatest hits release for the spring of 2010. The band returned to the studio to re-record two old songs which originally appeared on their unreleased &quot;Galaxy Sessions&quot; album: &quot;Letters to Noelle&quot; and &quot;Wait&quot;. Adam Young of Owl City produced a new remix of &quot;I Woke Up in a Car&quot;. The greatest hits album, named &quot;Played in Space: The Best of Something Corporate&quot; was released on April 27, 2010. On May 15, 2010, Something Corporate announced their August 2010 Reunion Tour on their website. In August 2011, McMahon said the band went back on hiatus.

On November 11, 2016 at the Seventh Annual Dear Jack Benefit, McMahon, Page, Ireland, Partington and Tell reunited to perform “Konstantine” and 
“Hurricane” at The Observatory in Santa Ana, California.

The final show of Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness&#x27; 2022 Hello Gone Days tour took place on September 9, 2022, in Anaheim, California and was a celebration of McMahon&#x27;s 40th birthday. As part of the show, a surprise Something Corporate reunion was staged, where McMahon, Kevin Page, Brian Ireland, Josh Partington, and William Tell played a 5-song set. Wilderness band member Zac Clark sat in on keys.

Something Corporate performed at the 2023 When We Were Young Festival in Las Vegas with a headlining show at the House of Blues the night before. The House of Blues show marked the first time in nearly 20 years the core line-up of the band (Andrew McMahon, Kevin Page, Brian Ireland, Josh Partington, and William Tell) had performed a headlining show together. The reunion weekend was, in part, to recognize the 20th anniversary of &quot;North&quot;. The anniversary was further marked with re-pressing of the album, along with &quot;North&quot;. Additional reunion performances were soon announced, with two headlining shows in Anaheim, on December 30 and 31, 2023. The band performed on Weekend One of Austin City Limits Music Festival on October 5, 2024. Additional performances are to take place in November 2024 on the inaugural &quot;Andrew McMahon&#x27;s Holiday from Real Cruise&quot;, set to feature all three of McMahon&#x27;s projects: Something Corporate, Jack&#x27;s Mannequin, and Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness.

==Musical style==
AllMusic biographer Jason Birchmeier described the band&#x27;s sound &quot;polished, literate, radio-ready alt-rock.&quot; &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; and &quot;North&quot; have been described as pop-punk.

<doc id="566676" wikidata="Q2731518" url="?curid=566676" title="Discovery (Electric Light Orchestra album)">
<text>Discovery is the eighth studio album by English rock band Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). It was released on 1 June 1979 in the United Kingdom by Jet Records, where it topped record charts, and on 8 June in the United States on Jet through Columbia Records distribution. A music video album featuring all the songs being played by the band was then released on VHS in 1979, then re-released as part of the &quot;Out of the Blue: Live at Wembley&quot; DVD and VHS in 1998.

==Background==
&quot;Discovery&quot; was the band&#x27;s first number 1 album in the UK, entering the chart at that position and staying there for five weeks. The album contained five hit songs in &quot;Shine a Little Love&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot;, &quot;Last Train to London&quot;, &quot;Confusion&quot; and &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp&quot;, many of which were heavily influenced by disco (in fact, Richard Tandy nicknamed the album, &quot;Disco Very&quot;). &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot; would become one of their only two top three hits in the UK throughout their career (&quot;Xanadu&quot; would be number one in 1980), and also their highest-charting US single at number 4. &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp&quot; was also a hit single in the UK, not patterned after the disco sound; instead it was closer in its Beatlesque style to the band&#x27;s earlier hit &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot;. The album itself was the first ever to generate four top-ten singles (one of which was a Double A-side) from a single LP in the UK and was eventually certified 2× platinum by the RIAA in 1997.

&quot;Discovery&quot; is notable in that it was the first ELO album not to feature their resident string trio of Mik Kaminski, Hugh McDowell and Melvyn Gale, although they did make an appearance on the &quot;Discovery&quot; music videos.

In one of his earliest jobs, comedian/actor Brad Garrett, dressed in Middle Eastern clothes and turban, appears on the back cover as the menacing palace guard who is drawing his scimitar.

&quot;Discovery&quot; was remastered as part of the Epic/Legacy remaster series in 2001; among the included bonus tracks was a cover of a Del Shannon classic, &quot;Little Town Flirt&quot;, which was started during sessions for the album but never finished until the year the album was reissued.

<doc id="566687" wikidata="Q3567364" url="?curid=566687" title="Wes Ferrell">
<text>Wesley Cheek Ferrell (February 2, 1908 – December 9, 1976) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball from 1927 through 1941. Primarily a starting pitcher, Ferrell played for the Cleveland Indians (1927–33), Boston Red Sox (1934–37), Washington Senators (1937–38), New York Yankees (1938–39), Brooklyn Dodgers (1940) and Boston Braves (1941). He batted and threw right-handed.

==Early life==
Wesley Cheek Ferrell was born on February 2, 1908, in Greensboro, North Carolina, to Rufus Benjamin &quot;Lonnie&quot; and Alice Clara Carpenter. His father was employed by the Southern Railroad, and the family lived on a 160-acre dairy farm that was also used to grow crops such as hay and tobacco. Wes was the fifth of seven children who were all boys. They each played baseball for the local high school team, and two others went on to enjoy long careers in baseball: Rick, a Hall of Fame catcher, and George, an 18-year minor league veteran.

Wesley starred in baseball and basketball while playing for Guilford High School, and later for the Oak Ridge Military Academy in 1926. He was soon noticed by Bill Rapp, a scout for the Cleveland Indians, and in 1927 they, as well as the Detroit Tigers, offered him a contract while he was playing for a semi-professional team in East Douglas, Massachusetts. He chose the Indians, and joined the team for the remainder of the 1927 season. He made his Major League Baseball debut on September 9, 1927, pitching a single inning against the Boston Red Sox, and gave up three earned runs. Although, he initially made the Indians&#x27; roster in 1928, he was soon demoted to the Terre Haute Tots, of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. He pitched well for the Tots, winning 20 games against eight losses, and had a 2.74 earned run average. In September, he was re-called to majors, and pitched two games before the season ended. He started both games, completed one of them, and while he pitched well, he received the loss in both.

== Major league career ==

=== Cleveland Indians ===
In 1929, he joined the Indians for good. Though only a spot-starter at first, he established himself as one of the best pitchers in the American League (AL) by season&#x27;s end. He was noted to have had an excellent fastball, which he complemented with a good curveball and a deceptive changeup. He posted a 21–10 win–record with 100 strikeouts and a 3.60 earned run average (ERA). His 21 victories placed second in the league behind George Earnshaw&#x27;s 24, and he finished in the top ten in strikeouts, earned run average, and saves. In 1930, he began the season as the Indians&#x27; number two starting pitcher behind Willis Hudlin, who made the team&#x27;s opening day start. He quickly established himself as the team&#x27;s ace by significantly improving his pitching performance. He increased his win total to 25 which finished second in the league, this time behind Lefty Grove&#x27;s 28, and lowered his ERA to 3.31. His batting skills improved in 1930; his batting average jumped from .237 in 1929 to .297 in 1930.

Ferrell continued his excellence during the 1931 season. Although his ERA increased to 3.75, he led the league in complete games with 27 and collected another 22 wins. On April 29, he pitched a 9–0 no-hitter against the St. Louis Browns, striking out eight, while also hitting a home run and a double and amassing four runs batted in (RBIs). His brother Rick was the Browns&#x27; catcher. On May 8, he experienced pain in his right shoulder while warming up for a start against the Red Sox, and for the rest of the season his fastball became largely ineffective, forcing him to rely upon his other pitches. As stellar as his pitching statistics were, it was his hitting skills that were dramatically improving each season. Through 1930, he had hit just one home run but in 1931 he hit nine, breaking the previous home run record for pitchers of seven by Jack Stivetts in 1890. On August 31 he hit two home runs against the Chicago White Sox in 13–5 victory at Comiskey Park, the first of five times he would achieve the feat.
Ferrell was an honest and outspoken individual, and his attitude began to sour during this period of his career. It was suspected that he had anxiety in regard to his shoulder injury, which caused him to angrily react to perceived bad calls by umpires, and teammates who made errors that negatively affected the game. On one occasion, Ferrell refused to be pulled from a game by his manager, and was suspended ten days without pay for insubordination. Because of his volatile temperament he was fined and suspended several times for refusing to leave a game, or for leaving it without permission. After being driven from the mound in one game, he punched himself in the face and began to slam his head into the wall. He had to be restrained by his team to stop him from continuing to hurt himself. Despite the pain in his shoulder, and worsening behavioral issues, he continued to be a durable and effective pitcher. In 1932, Ferrell posted his fourth consecutive 20-win season, with a record of 23–13, struck out 105, and had a 3.66 ERA.

The 1933 season began well for Ferrell; he had a 5–4 win–loss record and a 2.12 ERA on June 1, and was named to the inaugural Major League Baseball All-Star Game representing the American League. He was not called upon to play in the game, but his brother Rick was also selected to the team, and played the entire game. As the season progressed, however, his performance began to diminish. From July until the end of the season, he was largely ineffective as a pitcher, and his availability became infrequent. In response, his manager, Roger Peckinpaugh, tried playing him in left field. The experiment was deemed a failure, owing to Ferrell&#x27;s lack of fielding skills. He had another great year as a batter, however, hitting seven home runs, and he compiled 26 RBIs and a .271 batting average. After a disappointing 11–12 record for the year, the Indians offered him what Ferrell regarded as an unacceptable contract offer, and he refused to sign. He also refused to join the team unless his contract demands were met. For his first 100 starts in his career, Ferell went 63-32 (.663), with the winning percentage being among the highest in MLB history for first 100 starts. On May 25, 1934, the Indians traded him, along with Dick Porter, to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Bob Weiland, Bob Seeds and $25,000 cash.

=== Boston Red Sox ===
By joining the Red Sox, Ferrell united with his brother Rick, who was their starting catcher. He made his debut for Boston on May 30 in relief, as were his next two appearances. He entered the starting rotation on June 10. On August 12, in front of a record crowd of 46,766 fans (with about 20,000 turned away), Babe Ruth made his farewell appearance as a New York Yankee in Boston. He singled and doubled against Ferrell, but Boston prevailed against Ruth and the New York Yankees by a score of 6–4. From that point until the end of the season, he was consistently effective, lowering his ERA from 4.64 on July 25, to a season-ending 3.63. He completed the 1934 season with a 14–5 record, and twice hit two home runs in a game. The first occurred against the St. Louis Browns on July 13, and the other on August 22 against the Chicago White Sox when he hit a game-tying home run in the eighth inning, then hit the game-winning, walk-off home run in tenth inning. Never known as a control pitcher, Ferrell&#x27;s base on balls totals were usually high, including leading the league with 130 in 1931, but in 1934, his bases on balls per 9 innings pitched was the best in AL.

In 1935, Ferrell continued the success he had in the latter part of 1934, and arguably had his greatest season. He compiled league-leading totals with victories with 25, as well as innings pitched, games started, and games completed. He also finished within the leaders in shutouts, bases on balls per nine innings, and strikeouts. As a batter, he had a .347 batting average, and hit seven home runs, the third, and last, time he reached this plateau. On July 21, with the Red Sox trailing the Detroit Tigers 4–6 in the bottom of the ninth inning and two runners on the bases. Ferrell was sent in as a pinch hitter and hit a three-run walk-off home run, defeating the Tigers by the score of 7–6. The following day, Ferrell once again hit a walk-off home run, this time in a tied-game against the St. Louis Browns. His achievements during the 1935 season resulted in his second-place finish in the Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, finishing behind Hank Greenberg.

Ferrell had another effective season in 1936, with a 20–15 record, while leading the league in games started, complete games, and inning pitched. His best games that season were two-hit shoutouts; one occurred on May 3 against the Tigers, and the other on June 21 against the Browns. This was his sixth and last time he achieved the 20-win mark during his major league career. His 1937 season began slow and he was unable to turn it around, by June 11, he had just three victories against six losses, and his ERA was a lofty 7.61. On June 11, the Ferrell brothers and Mel Almada were traded to the Washington Senators in exchange for Ben Chapman and Bobo Newsom.

=== Later career ===

Shortly after being traded to Washington, Wes won four of his first five starts, and was named to his second All-Star team. Joining him on the team was his brother Rick, and the game was played on July 7, although neither of the Ferrell brothers played. Although he had a lackluster pitching record of 14–19, he led the AL in innings and complete games for the third consecutive season. Ferrell remained with Washington in 1938, and leading the team with 13 victories, but due to his behavior and personality conflict with owner Clark Griffith, he was released from the team on August 12. Ferrell was quickly signed by the Yankees, and appeared in five games before the season ended. Over the following winter, he underwent arm surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow, but was unable to fully recover. He was released by the Yankees in May 1939, and went unsigned until January 1940, when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers. He made just one relief appearance for the Dodgers before being released in May. He signed with the Boston Braves in February 1941, but was released after four games.

Ferrell finished his major-league career with a win–loss record of 193–128, 4.04 ERA, and 985 strikeouts in 2623 innings pitched. In 374 games pitched, he started 323, completed 227, and tossed 17 shutouts. In addition to his talents as a pitcher, he was also one of the best-hitting pitchers in major league history, setting records for pitchers; his nine home runs in 1931, and his career-total of 38 still stand. In total, he collected 329 hits, 57 doubles, and 12 triples; delivered 208 RBIs; scored 175 runs; and compiled a .446 slugging percentage, and a .280 batting average. Defensively, he was a better than average fielding pitcher, recording a .975 fielding percentage, which was 21 points higher than the league average at his position.

== Post-major league career ==
Even after the end of his major league career, Ferrell continued to play minor league ball. During these later years, he mainly played the outfield. After his release by the Braves in May 1941, he signed with the Leaksville-Draper-Spray Triplets of the class-D Bi-State League, where he batted .332 with 20 home runs in just 74 games. The following season, he joined the class-C Lynchburg Senators of the Virginia League, where he hit .361 with 31 homers in 123 games. He continued to play sporadically in the minors for several years before finally retiring for good after the 1949 season.

=== Later life and legacy ===
Wes Ferrell died at the age of 68 on December 9, 1976, in Sarasota, Florida, and is interred at New Garden Cemetery in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Arguments in favor of inducting Ferrell into the Baseball Hall of Fame include the factors which affected his numbers and lack of post-season success. In addition to the era in which he played, he didn&#x27;t play for many good teams, and he pitched in hitter-friendly parks. In his book, &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, Bill James, noted that Ferrell&#x27;s high career ERA of 4.04 is not surprising due to the heavy-hitting era in which he played. The average AL ERA during his playing time was lofty 4.54. However, when Ferrell&#x27;s ERA is adjusted with what he produced as a hitter, he was effectively 22% better than the league average. In this regard, he is comparable to other high-ERA pitchers that helped themselves by being a good batter such as Ted Lyons, a Hall of Fame member, and Carl Mays. He also has the record of most homeruns hit batting as a pitcher with 37 and has a career BA of .280, a career OBP of .351, a career SLG of .446, and an OPS of .797.

Although he, unlike his brother, has not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;, in celebration of his being not just a star pitcher but the best-hitting pitcher of all time—noting that Babe Ruth did most of his hitting when he was no longer a regular pitcher.

In February 2008, Ferrell was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame. He is the only pitcher since 1900 to win 20 games in his first four full major league seasons. He retired with the seventh highest winning percentage (.601) among pitchers with at least 300 AL decisions (for teams that never won the pennant) and also with the fourth highest fielding percentage (.975) in AL history.

&quot;I didn&#x27;t see any big deal in being a good hitter as well as a good pitcher&quot;, said Ferrell, a two-time minor league batting champion as an outfielder after his major league days were over. When he went on to be a manager, Ferrell was slapped with suspensions for incidents such as removing his team from the field, which through erroneous reports grew into legends of Ferrell having physically attacked umpires. He was a fiery competitor and a brilliant player with natural talent, whose achievements may have been obscured by his irascibility.

<text>Stuart Jonathan Russell (born 1962) is a British computer scientist known for his contributions to artificial intelligence (AI). He is a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley and was from 2008 to 2011 an adjunct professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco. He holds the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering at University of California, Berkeley. He founded and leads the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) at UC Berkeley. Russell is the co-author with Peter Norvig of the authoritative textbook of the field of AI: &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot; used in more than 1,500 universities in 135 countries.

==Education and early life==
Russell was born in Portsmouth, England. He attended St Paul&#x27;s School, London, where he was 1st scholar. He studied physics at Wadham College, Oxford, and was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree with first-class honours in 1982. He moved to the United States to complete his PhD in computer science at Stanford University in 1986 for research on inductive reasoning and analogical reasoning supervised by Michael Genesereth. His PhD was supported by a NATO studentship from the UK Science and Engineering Research Council.

==Career and research==
After his 1986 PhD, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley as a professor of computer science. From 2008 to 2011 he also held an appointment as adjunct professor of Neurological Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, where he pursued research in computational physiology and intensive-care unit monitoring. He is also an Honorary Fellow at Wadham College, Oxford.
His research in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) includes contributions to machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, real-time decision making, multitarget tracking, computer vision, and inverse reinforcement learning. He has also been an active participant in the movement to ban the manufacture and use of autonomous weapons.

In 2016, he founded the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence at UC Berkeley, with co-principal investigators Pieter Abbeel, Anca Dragan, Tom Griffiths, Bart Selman, Joseph Halpern, Michael Wellman and Satinder Singh Baveja. Russell has published several hundred conference and journal articles as well as several books, including &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Analogy and Induction&quot; and &quot;Do the Right Thing: Studies in Limited Rationality&quot; (with Eric Wefald). Along with Peter Norvig, he is the author of &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot;, a textbook used by over 1,500 universities in 135 countries. He is on the Scientific Advisory Board for the Future of Life Institute and the advisory board of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.

In 2017 he collaborated with the Future of Life Institute to produce a video, &quot;Slaughterbots&quot;, about swarms of drones assassinating political opponents, and presented this to a United Nations meeting about the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.

In 2018 he contributed an interview to the documentary &quot;Do You Trust This Computer?.&quot;

His book, &quot;Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control&quot;, was published by Viking on 8 October 2019. His work is aligned with Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence themes. His former doctoral students include Marie desJardins, Eric Xing and Shlomo Zilberstein.

Russell gave the 2021 Reith Lectures, broadcast on BBC Radio 4, on &quot;Living with Artificial Intelligence&quot; with lectures on &quot;The Biggest Event in Human History&quot;, &quot;AI in warfare&quot;, &quot;AI in the economy&quot; and &quot;AI: A Future for Humans&quot;.

In March 2023, Russell signed an open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for &quot;all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4&quot;. The letter has been signed by over 30,000 individuals, including AI researchers such as Yoshua Bengio and Gary Marcus. In a January 2025 article in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Russell wrote &quot;In other words, the AGI race is a race towards the edge of a cliff.&quot; 

===Awards and honors===
Russell was co-winner, in 1995, of the IJCAI Computers and Thought Award at the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, the premier international award in artificial intelligence for researchers under 35. In 2022, he received the IJCAI Award for Research Excellence, only the second person (after Hector Levesque) to win both of IJCAI&#x27;s main research awards. He is a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), elected in 1997, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) (2003) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2011). In 2005, he was awarded the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award. In 2012, he was appointed to the Blaise Pascal Chair in Paris, awarded to &quot;internationally acclaimed foreign scientists in all disciplines,&quot; as well as the senior Chaire d&#x27;excellence of France&#x27;s Agence Nationale de la Recherche.

Russell served as vice chair of the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Council on AI and Robotics and is currently a member of its Global AI Council. Other awards he has received include the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Presidential Young Investigator Award, the World Technology Award, the Mitchell Prize, and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Outstanding Educator Award. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to artificial intelligence research.

<text>Bait is any appetizing substance (e.g. food) used to attract prey when hunting or fishing, most commonly in the form of trapping (e.g. mousetrap and bird trap), ambushing (e.g. from a hunting blind) and angling.

Baiting is a ubiquitous practice in both recreational (especially angling) and commercial fishing, but the use of live bait can be deemed illegal under certain fisheries law and local jurisdictions. For hunting, however, baiting can often be controversial as it violates the principles of fair chase, although it is still a commonly accepted practice in varmint hunting, culling and pest control.

== Uses ==
=== Fishing ===

Baiting is ubiquitously practised to catching fish. Traditionally, nightcrawlers, small baitfish, insect adults and larvae have been used as standard hookbait, and offals are commonly used as groundbait (a.k.a. chumming) in blue water fishing. Modern fishermen have also begun using more plastic bait and lures, and more recently, electronic bionic baits, to attract the more territorial and aggressive predatory fishes. Because of the risk of transmitting &quot;Myxobolus cerebralis&quot; (whirling disease), trout and salmon should not be used as bait. There are various types of natural saltwater bait. Studies show that natural baits like croaker and shrimp are better recognized therefore more readily accepted by fish. The best bait for red drum (red fish) are [ pogy (menhaden) and, in the fall, specks like croaker.

=== Hunting ===
Baiting is a common practice in leopard hunting on a safari. A dead, smaller-sized antelope is usually placed high in the tree to lure the otherwise overcautious leopard. The hunter either watches the bait from point within firing range or stalks the animal if it has come for the bait during the night.

In areas where bears are hunted, bait can be found for sale at gas stations and hunting supply stores. Often consisting of some sweet substance, such as frosting or molasses, combined with an aromatic like rotten meat or fish, the bait is spread and the hunter waits under cover for his prey.

Cecil the Lion, who was infamously poached by an American trophy bowhunter in 2015, was baited out of the protected area into an ambush at the margin of a private land by a deliberately planted elephant carcass.

=== Pest control ===


Poisoned bait is a common method for controlling rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches, and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food attractant for the target species and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets.

== Legal usage ==
=== In Australia ===
Baiting in Australia refers to specific campaigns to control foxes, wild dogs and dingos by poisoning in areas where they are a problem. These programs are held in conjunction with the local Department of Primary Industries, Rural Lands Protection Board (RLPB) and National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) to facilitate a neighbourhood baiting campaign. 

Australian hunters often use carcasses when hunting feral pigs. Shot feral animals are often left in the field, and the decaying smell attracts more pigs to scavenge over the subsequent days.

<doc id="566695" wikidata="Q3473880" url="?curid=566695" title="Mazama, Washington">
<text>Mazama ( )
is an unincorporated community in Okanogan County (population 158) located in the Methow Valley of Washington, on the east slopes of the North Cascades and North Cascades National Park. It is located along the North Cascades Highway (Highway 20), northwest of Winthrop and about south of the Canada–United States border. Mazama&#x27;s town center elevation is , and it is located south of and below Goat Peak.

Founded around the beginning of the twentieth century,
Mazama boomed as the departure point for mining towns in the rugged Harts Pass area, such as Barron, Chancellor, and Robinson. The settlement is centered at the intersection of Lost River Road and Country Road 9140. It has a general store, an adventure supply store, a gas station, a café, and two restaurants. The area is a destination for outdoor recreation, including rock climbing, mountaineering, snowmobiling, and back-country skiing. It is home to one of the world&#x27;s longest cross-country skiing trails, stretching for and running through the settlement.

==Etymology==
In the 19th century, the town was called &quot;Goat Creek&quot;, after a creek at the base of nearby Goat Peak (then called Goat Mountain). When the former post office was secured in 1899, the settlers chose a name they thought was Greek for &quot;mountain goat&quot;. They later discovered that they had looked in the wrong dictionary and, according to Edmond S. Meany, the meaning of &quot;Mazama&quot; was not &quot;mountain goat&quot; in Greek.

According to toponymist William Bright the name &quot;Mazama&quot; originally came from the Nahuatl word &quot;mazame&quot;, &quot;deer (plural)&quot;, from &quot;mazatl&quot;, &quot;a deer&quot;, referring to brocket deer. In the past the word was used locally to refer to mountain goats or bighorn mountain sheep. In 1896 the word was used in the naming of the Portland mountaineering club, The Mazamas.

== Ecology ==

The Methow River flows immediately to the south of Mazama, where it provides spawning habitat to spring Chinook salmon.

Forests of native Douglas-fir and Ponderosa pine are widespread in Mazama and its surroundings, with ample Cottonwood along creeks and rivers.

Over seventy species of mammals are indigenous to the area. This includes the Northern pocket gopher, but ironically, not the Mazama pocket gopher.

==Climate==
Mazama has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;) with warm, dry summers, and cold, snowy winters. It lies immediately leeward of the North Cascades, which trap much of the precipitation carried from the Pacific Ocean by prevailing westerly winds. This rain shadow strengthens with increasing distance from the Cascade crest: semi-arid Winthrop. Winthrop, approximately 14 miles further down-valley, receives a little over half the annual precipitation of Mazama. Mazama’s relatively heavy snowfall, along with the brief hours of winter daylight in a deep mountain valley, inspired the first settlers to nickname the area &quot;Early Winters.&quot;

Washington’s record cold temperature was measured in both Mazama and Winthrop: on December 30, 1968.

The average seasonal snowfall for the Mazama area is 119.7 inches,
with an average of 136 days per year having at least 1 inch of snow on the ground.
The greatest snow depth at any one time during the period of record, 62 inches, 
was recorded on January 1, 1997.


==Geology==

Geologic units in and near Mazama include Cretaceous andesite, diorite and plutonic rocks. At least one Middle Eocene dike intrudes a Cretaceous volcanic unit north of town. The Mesozoic units that make up the mountains that bracket Mazama are cut by thrust and transform faults. Quaternary alluvium floors the Methow River valley.

Soils are characteristically Leiko
stony ashy sandy loam.

==Activities==

The Mazama area offers cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, hiking, rock climbing, and mountaineering.

In the 1970s and 1980s, various proposals to build a ski resort on Sandy Butte near Mazama were submitted to the United States Forest Service amid opposition from local residents. It was planned to accommodate up to 8,200 skiers and cost $25 million to construct. The final iteration of the proposal, named Arrowleaf Resort, was withdrawn in 1999 following a ruling by the Washington State Department of Ecology that denied water rights for the project.

Mazama is also the location for one of the Outward Bound School&#x27;s Northwest locations (NWOBS). NWOBS was founded in 1965.

<doc id="566699" wikidata="Q4704926" url="?curid=566699" title="BBC News Online">
<text>BBC News Online is the website of BBC News, the division of the BBC responsible for newsgathering and production. It is one of the most popular news websites, with 1.2 billion website visits in April 2021, as well as being used by 60% of the UK&#x27;s internet users for news.

The website contains international news coverage, as well as British, entertainment, science, and political news. Many reports are accompanied by audio and video from the BBC&#x27;s television and radio news services, while the latest TV and radio bulletins are also available to view or listen to on the site together with other current affairs programmes.

BBC News Online is closely linked to its sister department website, that of BBC Sport. Both sites follow similar layout and content options and respective journalists work alongside each other. Location information provided by users is also shared with the website of BBC Weather to provide local content.

From 1998 to 2001 the site was named best news website at the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards when the award category was withdrawn. It has previously won both the Judges&#x27; award and the People&#x27;s Voice award for best news site at the annual Webby Awards.

== History ==

The website was launched on 4 November 1997, and was headed by founding editor Mike Smartt and Project Director Bob Eggington. The broader editorial team was brought together from within the BBC, from print journalism and from some online sites.

The BBC had previously created special websites marking the 1995 Budget, the 1996 Olympic Games, 1997 general election, and the death of Princess Diana in 1997, but nothing on the scale of the launch of the main site itself, which required the development of a completely new production system, for which a team, led by Matthew Karas, was specially hired.

The original design was created by a team, including Matt Jones, and was based on designs by Mike Bennett and design studio Sunbather. Sunbather worked with consultancy, Lambie-Nairn, who looked after the overall brand, and has been redesigned several times mainly to match the visual style of BBC News television bulletins and to exploit increases in readers&#x27; typical screen resolutions. A major overhaul in 2003, primarily by Paul Sissons and Maire Flynn, coincided with a relaunch of the BBC News Channel (then BBC News 24) and featured a wider page design. The site launched a set of semi-official RSS 0.91 syndication feeds in June 2003 and upgraded them to full feed RSS 2.0 in 2008. Each news index has its own RSS feed, including the in-depth sections.

In 2004 the BBC News website partnered with Moreover Technologies, in a response to the 2003 Graf Report, to provide links from BBC articles to rival publishers. While the BBC does not censor or change results, the algorithms used tend to give greater weight to national and international sources over regional or local ones.

Mike Smartt, who became editor in chief in 2000, was later succeeded by Pete Clifton who was subsequently promoted to Head of BBC News Interactive and replaced by the previous editor Steve Herrmann in 2005.

The BBC began providing real-time global user information in June 2006.

A restructuring of BBC News starting in 2007 saw the dissolution of the separate BBC News Interactive department; the editorial and management departments joined the new multimedia newsroom along with television and radio news within BBC Television Centre.
New features were gradually introduced, including the publicising of video content more prominently. From May 2007, the website began to offer a live video stream of BBC News 24, the rolling news channel now known as the BBC News channel. In line with the introduction of new features across BBC Online, including a new navigation bar, the site was updated in 2008 with wider centred page designs, larger images and an increased emphasis on audio and visual content.

Beginning on 30 April 2009, some published stories included in-text links, mostly to in-site profile articles on people, locations and organisations. The BBC announced on 19 November 2009 that it was to pay more attention to search engine optimisation by extending news headlines.

On 14 July 2010, the site was completely redesigned, with the vertical section headings moved to run horizontally near the top of the page. The new design, incorporating larger in-line videos within news articles and standardised font usage, was introduced as a first step to bringing the entire BBC website into line with its new style guidelines. It was met with mixed opinions; Stephen Fry stated his approval of the redesign, and the new design was praised for being &quot;more attractive [and] graphically stronger&quot;. However, there was also criticism, with some stating that the use of white space was too widespread and led to the need for continuous and excessive scrolling.
On 4 March 2014, the BBC launched a beta version of the website that was built around the principles of responsive web design, allowing the presentation of content to adjust automatically for a wide variety of screen sizes, from desktop computer to smartphones and tablet devices. The new design went live on 23 March 2015.

== Features ==
=== UK/International editions ===
There are two different editions of the site: a UK edition, which gives prominence to UK stories, and an international edition, which prioritises international news. Internet users with IP addresses originating from the UK are served the UK edition; all others receive the international edition. The international version contains advertising and an &quot;Advertise With Us&quot; link at the bottom. The international version of the website is operated by BBC Global News Ltd., the for-profit BBC subsidiary that operates the BBC World News television channel. All articles are archived indefinitely and can be retrieved via searching or by browsing the extensive &quot;Special Reports&quot; section, which contains collections of articles relating to major news stories. The previous seven days&#x27; top stories were formerly available through the Week at a Glance section of the website. As well as pure news articles, the site also contains material to support BBC news, current affairs and factual programmes.

=== Columnists ===

BBC News Online uses a blog-style system for correspondents to write articles within their specialism. Journalists including Nick Robinson and Kamal Ahmed use blogs to provide updates on current events and topics. Editors also provide entries within the &quot;Editors&#x27; blog&quot;, giving explanations for editorial decisions as well as announcing new features or services. Members of the public are also given the opportunity to comment on entries from journalists and editors.

Prior to the adoption of the blog-style, BBC News Online also had a number of topic-specific columns written by BBC journalists, such as former education correspondent Mike Baker&#x27;s &quot;Mike Baker Weekly&quot;, and technology commentator Bill Thompson&#x27;s &quot;bill board&quot; (formerly &quot;bill blog&quot;). BBC News Online Science Writer Ivan Noble, diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour in August 2002, shared his experiences of cancer in &quot;Tumour Diary&quot; until his death on 31 January 2005.

=== Magazine ===
The &#x27;Magazine&#x27; is a section of BBC News Online that includes a number of articles that are not tied to a particular event or topic, unlike the other articles on the site. The editor is Jonathan Duffy, who took over from Giles Wilson in April 2006.

A major part of the magazine was the &quot;Magazine Monitor&quot; column, which took an irreverent view on the day&#x27;s news. It usually included the &quot;Paper Monitor&quot;, which provided a commentary on the daily press in the United Kingdom. During the day a series of caption competitions and oddities were added. On weekday evenings at around 5 p.m. GMT, letters from readers, both serious and light-hearted, were published. Topics could be varied: comments on news stories; how to measure sizes in terms of London AEC Routemaster buses, or for larger geographical areas, Wales; spotting people mentioned in news stories whose name is particularly appropriate for their job, etc. Other favourite areas of discussion included the Flexicon, the gender of Paper Monitor or coming up with sardonic comments about previous letters.

On Friday evenings, ready for Saturday morning, an article called &quot;10 things we didn&#x27;t know last week&quot; collated odd and interesting facts from the week&#x27;s news. Readers were encouraged to send their own images depicting ten objects to accompany the facts; past examples have included 10 swans flying in formation and ten toes.

Since a redesign of the BBC News Online in September 2006, the Magazine Monitor followed a blog-style layout, rather than as a page updated over the week in a similar way to news articles. Comments were allowed, but not published, other than a selection in the daily letters.

On 28 September 2016 the BBC News Magazine was rolled into the broader BBC Stories topic, itself closed on 19 September 2020.

=== &quot;On This Day&quot; ===

&quot;On This Day&quot; is the name of the BBC&#x27;s news archive website. It contains an online digital library of news stories reported by the BBC on the Second World War and world events from the 1950s to 2005. There are entries for every day of the year, many including video or audio reports which can be viewed online. The stories are arranged by years, by themes, by witness accounts and by the correspondents reporting the stories. The front page used to be refreshed daily with past events from the current date, but the site is no longer maintained. Unlike the rest of BBC News Online, it still has a working text only version.

=== Embedded video and audio ===
The launch of the BBC iPlayer, with the new Adobe Flash based BBC Embedded Media Player in July 2007 enabled BBC News and Sport Online to change the way it presented video content. Previously the site had delivered online video content using embedded RealPlayer video in pop-up windows branded as the &quot;BBC News Player&quot;. From March 2008 the BBC began to gradually introduce embedded video using the EMP into individual news articles and onto the front page. The news player also provides constant live streaming of the BBC News channel via the website. This had previously only been viewable in a separate window.

=== Mobile and text only versions ===
Previously, in addition to the standard website with embedded video and audio, there were XHTML and WAP versions optimised for users on mobile devices. A text-only version of the main news website could be accessed via the BBC &quot;Betsie&quot; text to speech parser (now discontinued).

In March 2010 the BBC announced that the low graphics and PDA versions of the site would be discontinued. As of May 2010 these versions of the site are no longer available and redirect to the main and mobile websites respectively.

As of 23 March 2015, separate mobile and text only versions have been removed, and replaced with a &quot;responsive web design&quot;, allowing the presentation of content to adjust automatically for a wide variety of screen sizes, from desktop computer to smartphones and tablet devices.

However the low-graphics version of the On This Day pages does still work, as do the text versions of articles linked from it. 

The BBC also have mobile apps for news and sport, available on the Android, iOS and Windows Phone systems. The news app launched in 2010, originally for the iPhone and iPad, followed by other providers. In January 2015, it was redesigned to include the option to play video and further links within articles to others.

== Criticism ==
The site is primarily funded by the television licence, and used to carry no advertising. The World edition has received some subsidy from the UK&#x27;s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office through its grant-in-aid to the BBC World Service. Proposals to include advertising on the international version of the website were discussed by the BBC Trust in February 2007, but were opposed by BBC journalists, who feared it would weaken public trust in the impartiality of the BBC. In October 2007, it was confirmed that the site would start to carry advertising. The advertising consists of large animated banners, which has led to complaints that these make the site&#x27;s content harder to read.

The impartiality of the &quot;Have Your Say&quot; forums has been disputed by organisations such as News Sniffer: moderators are accused of sometimes appearing to promote their own agenda.

&quot;Have Your Say&quot; received much criticism in 2009 for featuring the question &quot;Should homosexuals face execution?&quot; The BBC later removed it and apologised after the BBC Pride board lobbied against it and Eric Joyce, the Labour MP for Falkirk, called it &quot;more than offensive&quot; and &quot;completely unacceptable&quot;.

<doc id="566702" wikidata="Q3289646" url="?curid=566702" title="Animal control service">
<text>An animal control service or animal control agency is an entity charged with responding to requests for help with animals, including wild animals, dangerous animals, and animals in distress. An individual who works for such an entity was once known as a dog catcher, but is generally now called an animal control officer, and may be an employee or a contractor – commonly employed by a municipality, county, shire, or other subnational government area.

==Duties and function==
Typically animals that are found will be checked for owner identification, including checking any ID tags, scanning for microchips, and checking for tattoos. Animals may be returned to their owners, or transported to a veterinary clinic or animal shelter. Animals held in the shelter can be returned to their owners, adopted, released to the wild, held as evidence in a criminal investigation or euthanized.

Animal control services may be provided by the government or through a contract with a humane society or society for the prevention of cruelty to animals. Officers may work for, or with, police or sheriff departments, parks and recreation departments, and health departments by confining animals or investigating animal bites to humans.

Active cruelty to animals may be an indicator of serious psychological or violence problems. Because of these links, in some places animal control officers have begun to look for and report on other issues.

=== Legal details in the United States of America ===
The most common requirements for this job is some prior experience handling animals on a farm, as a veterinary assistant or animal trainer. Training is primarily on the job but some jurisdictions (like Virginia, North Carolina and Texas) require formal and continuing education available from community colleges and trade associations.

Some animal cruelty investigators are specially trained police officers. The New York American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and Animal Care Centers of NYC (ACC) employs several Humane Law Enforcement Officers with some police powers (including the power of arrest) and the Oregon Humane Society employs Humane Special Agents in partnership with the Oregon State Police who are fully-sworn law enforcement officers. Throughout the United States this arrangement is becoming more common.

An American colloquialism labels an unpopular politician by saying that they &quot;couldn&#x27;t be elected dogcatcher&quot;, with &quot;dogcatcher&quot; referring to a very low-level elected office.

In practice, animal control officers are generally appointed by an executive authority and not elected. However, historic equivalents such as poundmaster, which was tasked with the control of stray livestock, and hog reeve, whose mandate extended exclusively to stray swine, were elective offices in Colonial and early American New England. The town of Duxbury, Vermont was said to be the only place in the contemporary United States that actually elects a dog catcher, but electing of dogcatchers was found to be illegal in Vermont in 2018. The job was then designated as appointment-only, with Zeb Towne, the last elected dogcatcher in Duxbury, being unanimously appointed to the position.

<text>Richard James Codey (born November 27, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 53rd governor of New Jersey from 2004 to 2006. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the New Jersey Senate from 1982 to 2024 and as the President of the Senate from 2002 to 2010. He represented the 27th Legislative District, which covered the western portions of Essex County and the southeastern portion of Morris County.

Codey is the longest-serving state legislator in New Jersey history, having served in the New Jersey Legislature continuously from January 8, 1974 to January 9, 2024.

==Early life==

Codey grew up in his family&#x27;s funeral home in Orange. He attended Our Lady of the Valley High School and transferred to Orange High School, neither of them successfully, before switching to Oratory Preparatory School in Summit, from which he graduated. He went on to take over his father&#x27;s job as a licensed funeral director. When his father, Donald, became the county coroner, Richard was drafted to help with death scene pickups. Codey remembered, &quot;I was 14, taking bodies out of train wrecks. You grow up quick.&quot; Codey has described himself as &quot;100% Irish&quot;.

== New Jersey Assembly ==
Codey left the funeral trade to try his hand in politics in 1973 when he was first elected to the State Assembly, with Eldridge Hawkins as his running mate. He served in the Assembly from 1974 to 1982. In 1981 he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education from Fairleigh Dickinson University.

== New Jersey Senate ==
Codey was elected to the State Senate that same year and has since risen through the ranks to become Senate President. He first ascended to that post in 2002 to 2010. He serves in the Senate on the Legislative Services Commission. He also has a hockey arena named in his honor, also known as South Mountain Arena in West Orange, New Jersey.

=== Return to Senate service ===
 Instead of running for a full term as governor, Codey was re-elected to the New Jersey Senate in 2007. Codey represents the 27th Legislative District together with Assemblyman John F. McKeon, who was coincidentally also the mayor of West Orange, a town in Essex County, New Jersey, where Senator Codey&#x27;s family was raised. Codey and his family lived in West Orange until 2009, when they moved to neighboring Roseland. The other Assembly seat is occupied by Mila Jasey, who was elected to fill the seat in November 2007 after the resignation of Mims Hackett on September 8, 2007.

In September, 2006, during Menendez&#x27;s re-election campaign for his U.S. Senate seat, it was revealed that Menendez was the subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation. The situation closely resembled the situation faced by Robert Torricelli in his 2002 re-election campaign, where ethical problems and declining poll numbers led to Torricelli exiting the race, to be replaced as the Democratic candidate by former senator Frank Lautenberg. Political observers speculated that Codey could be tapped to fill the candidate&#x27;s slot should Menendez decide to withdraw from the race. However, on November 7, 2006, Menendez was elected to a full term.

Codey briefly resigned as President of the Senate for one day in January 2008 in order to let retiring Sen. Bernard Kenny of Hoboken serve as Senate President on his last day in office. Senator Kenny had served as Senate Majority Leader under Codey. Kenny served as Senate President from January 7 to January 8, when Senator Codey was reelected to the Senate Presidency for the next legislative session.

In December 2016, Codey was one of several Catholic legislators who supported legislation legalizing assisted suicide.

=== Committee assignments ===
Committee assignments for the current session are:
*Legislative Oversight, as &quot;Chair&quot;
*Environment and Energy
*Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens

=== District 27 ===
Each of the 40 districts in the New Jersey Legislature has one representative in the New Jersey Senate and two members in the New Jersey General Assembly. The representatives from the 27th District for the 2022—23 Legislative Session are:
*Senator Richard Codey (D) 
*Assemblyman John F. McKeon (D) 
*Assemblywoman Mila Jasey (D) 

== Governor of New Jersey ==

=== 2002 ===
Following Governor Christine Todd Whitman&#x27;s resignation in 2001 to become head of the EPA, Codey was one of three different senate presidents (along with Donald DiFrancesco and John O. Bennett, as well as Attorney General John Farmer) to serve as acting governor within the one-year period between Whitman&#x27;s resignation and Jim McGreevey&#x27;s inauguration in January 2002. DiFrancesco served as acting governor for all but the last week of this period, until his term as senate president ended. As attorney general, Farmer then served as acting governor for ninety minutes, until the election of Bennett and Codey as co-presidents of the senate. The latter two then divided the last week of the term between them, with Codey serving for three days, from January 12, 2002, to January 15, 2002, leading to a situation in which the state had five different people serving as governor during a period of eight days (DiFrancesco, Farmer, Bennett, Codey, and McGreevey).

=== 2004 to 2006 ===
Codey became acting governor again with the resignation of Jim McGreevey on November 15, 2004. According to the New Jersey State Constitution at the time, in the event of a vacancy in the governor&#x27;s office, the President of the State Senate takes on the additional position of acting governor until the next gubernatorial election. After taking over in 2004 Codey became popular with many New Jersey residents and reportedly considered a run for a full four-year term. However, U.S. Senator Jon Corzine&#x27;s large number of endorsements as well as his large campaign war chest, funded primarily by his great personal wealth, convinced Codey to announce officially on January 31, 2005, that he would step aside. Codey served as governor until Corzine was sworn in on January 17, 2006, following Corzine&#x27;s victory in the November 8, 2005 elections. Some had speculated that Codey could be a possible candidate for Corzine&#x27;s vacant seat in the United States Senate, with Corzine appointing his own successor once he was sworn in as governor. However, Codey announced on November 23, 2005, that he was not interested in the Senate seat.

On June 6, 2005, Codey announced revised nutrition guidelines for all state funded public and private schools, eliminating soda, candy, and other products with sugar as the leading ingredient from cafeteria offerings. The law became effective on September 1, 2007.

With the passage on November 8, 2005, of a constitutional amendment creating the position of lieutenant governor to take effect with the 2009 election, Codey became the last person to serve simultaneously as governor and senate president.
On January 9, 2006, Codey became governor (no longer acting governor) as a result of his signing legislation that provided that a person who serves as acting governor for a continuous period of at least 180 days will be &quot;Governor of the State of New Jersey&quot; for official and historical purposes. This law was made retroactive to 2001, covering both Codey&#x27;s service after McGreevey&#x27;s resignation and the service of Donald DiFrancesco following the resignation of Governor Christine Todd Whitman in 2001. This made DiFrancesco New Jersey&#x27;s 51st governor and Codey the 53rd.

Codey is an advocate of mental health awareness and strongly favors including mental health funding in employee medical benefit packages and Medicare. Both Codey and his wife, Mary Jo, have spoken candidly about her past struggles with postpartum depression. In early 2005, Codey responded in person to New Jersey 101.5 talk radio host Craig Carton, who jokingly criticized Mary Jo and her mental health on the air. Some argue that Codey&#x27;s comments were a physical threat against the radio personality. The Governor himself admits to telling Carton during the altercation that he wished he could &quot;take [Carton] outside&quot;, while in the presence of the six New Jersey State Policemen who were serving as his personal bodyguards. There was some speculation that this incident helped Codey decide not to run for a full term as governor. In July 2005, Codey also defended actress Brooke Shields after she faced criticism for discussing her postpartum depression. In December 2005, Codey appeared on Carton&#x27;s radio program to help put the incident behind both of them.

Codey appointed Mary Jane Cooper to be New Jersey&#x27;s first-ever Inspector General, a position created to root out waste and mismanagement in government. Codey added $7 million in new funding to agencies devoted to public accountability, per the recommendations that resulted from an audit of state ethics codes that he commissioned. In March 2005, Codey cracked down on pay to play when he signed a law banning campaign contributions by businesses holding state contracts in several circumstances.

As governor, Codey championed a bill to ban smoking from indoor spaces in the state, more money for stem cell research, increased funding for mental health, and sports. Codey created a task force to recommend ways to end steroid abuse in high school and college sports in the state. The task force established drug testing for high school athletes on teams that play in the championships, with the state paying for the drug testing program. He also successfully negotiated for MetLife Stadium, which was constructed jointly by the New York Giants and New York Jets.

In December 2005, Codey announced he was not accepting a new state slogan recommended by the State Commerce Department, following a study by a marketing consultant, which was paid for by the state. He said he felt the slogan &quot;We&#x27;ll win you over&quot; made the state seem desperate. Governor Codey openly solicited slogan suggestions from citizens and then choose five finalists, which he opened to a vote from the public. Days prior to leaving the governor&#x27;s office, Codey announced the winner: &quot;New Jersey: Come See for Yourself&quot;.

Shortly before leaving office, Codey signed the first legislative moratorium on capital punishment enacted by any state in the nation. The moratorium ended with the permanent ban of capital punishment by Codey&#x27;s successor, Jon Corzine.

As Corzine attended the swearing in of Bob Menendez as a U.S. Senator on January 18, 2006, in Washington, D.C., Codey spent part of his first day as former governor as the acting governor of the state.

=== 2007 ===
On April 12, 2007, Codey became Acting Governor of New Jersey when Corzine was incapacitated due to serious injuries suffered in a car accident that day. Codey became acting governor since New Jersey did not have the position of lieutenant governor until after the 2009 election. Corzine resumed his duties as governor on May 7, 2007.

=== Public opinion summary ===
Former Governor Jim McGreevey was the 11th governor in the history of the United States to resign due to a political scandal. In August 2004, just after McGreevey announced his intention to leave the office that November, Fairleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s PublicMind measured public views of his soon-to-be successor, Richard Codey, president of the New Jersey Senate. In a study released on August 16, 2004, FDU reported that 68% of New Jersey voters did not recognize Richard Codey&#x27;s name. Nevertheless, 30% of voters shared a favorable view of him while only 9% reported an unfavorable view.

Even two months later, in early October 2004, FDU&#x27;s poll release entitled &quot;Richard Who?&quot; found that, despite that Codey would soon take over as governor from McGreevey, the name &quot;Richard Codey&quot; remained unknown to 59% of New Jersey voters. However, voters who knew him held distinctly more favorable than unfavorable views by a two to one ratio, (23%–10%).

By early January 2005, when PublicMind again conducted a statewide study in which voters were asked: &quot;Have you heard of Richard Codey?,&quot; the numbers showed that 35% of New Jersey voters still did not recognize Codey&#x27;s name. However, 48% had a favorable view of him compared to 7% of those who had an unfavorable view, &quot;a formidable 7:1 ratio&quot; said the press release.

According to the next FDU PublicMind poll released on April 13, 2005, Gov. Codey&#x27;s recognition had improved significantly since the previous August when former Gov. McGreevey announced his resignation. Five months after assuming office, four of five voters (78%) recognized his name, (a 46-point increase from August 2004). In addition, voters were twice as likely to have a favorable view (51%) as opposed to an unfavorable view (25%) of the governor, a two-to-one ratio despite that three in five (59%) also lamented the state was &quot;on the wrong track.&quot;

In a study conducted by FDU&#x27;s PublicMind on July 21, 2005, results showed that 51% of NJ voters believed the state was on the wrong track. Nevertheless, their concerns about the state&#x27;s problems did not impact the image of Gov. Codey. Numbers indicated that half of voters in New Jersey rated Codey&#x27;s performance as excellent or good. Only 8% reported that he was doing a poor job. Dr. Peter J. Woolley, professor of political science and executive director of PublicMind commented: &quot;That&#x27;s pretty good for New Jersey… Codey&#x27;s plain spoken approach seems to soften people&#x27;s views of the state&#x27;s problems.&quot;

According to a PublicMind poll released September 27, 2005, a total of 21% of New Jersey voters still did not recognize their incumbent governor Richard Codey. However, this was a remarkable increase in recognition from six months earlier, when 35% of voters failed to recognize his name. In addition, more than half of voters (57%) agreed that his performance could be considered &quot;good&quot; or &quot;excellent.&quot;

A few months later, a sizable majority of New Jersey voters still retained a favorable view of the new governor. A PublicMind study released on November 22, 2005, indicated that 65% of voters shared a favorable view of Gov. Codey compared to 11% who held an unfavorable view.

As Gov. Codey prepared to leave office, making way for newly elected governor Jon Corzine, a FDU PublicMind study released on January 12, 2006, showed that 48% of voters said the state was &quot;on the wrong track&quot; while 34% said it was headed in the right direction. However, though voters had a negative view of the direction of state, their view of Gov. Codey was strongly positive. In that same study, 68% of voters who recognized Gov. Codey had a favorable opinion of him and the pollsters noted that the outgoing governor had &quot;an impressive 5:1 ratio of favorable to unfavorable opinion&quot;.

Out of the governor&#x27;s office for over five years, Codey continued to make headlines as a prospective candidate for that office. In a FDU PublicMind Poll released September 27, 2011, voters were asked &quot;If you could pick a Democrat to run against Chris Christie for governor, who would you prefer?&quot; Richard Codey came up as the most adequate candidate at 18% among other well-known Democrats like Cory Booker and Frank Pallone.

== Potential gubernatorial candidacy in 2009 ==
The Obama administration approached Codey in 2009 to consider running for governor in Corzine&#x27;s place if the incumbent withdrew from his reelection bid, citing polls showing that Codey led Republican Chris Christie. Corzine remained in the race and lost to Christie.

<text>1worldspace, known for most of its existence simply as WorldSpace, is a defunct satellite radio network that in its heyday provided service to over 170,000 subscribers in eastern, southern and northern Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia with 96% coming from India. It was profitable in India, with 450,000 subscribers.

The two operational satellites that the company had, AfriStar and AsiaStar, are now being used by their new owner, the Yazmi USA, LLC run by WorldSpace&#x27;s former CEO Noah A. Samara. The company claims to have built the first satellite-to-tablet content delivery system. The system primarily aims at providing educational services to rural areas in developing countries. The first pilots of the technology are said to be taking place in India (with 30,000 licenses) and the sub-Saharan region in Africa, with the latest trials in two schools in South Africa, in Rietkol, in Mpumalanga Province, and at Heathfield, in Western Cape.

== Overview ==

The company, founded in 1990, has its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland and additional studios were located in Washington, D.C., Bangalore, Mumbai, New Delhi, and Nairobi. In 1991 Noah Samara, working with Thomas van der Heyden – founder of what was then International Telecommunications Inc. (ITI), later in 1997 to become the geostationary satellite division of Orbital Sciences, prepared and filed for the world&#x27;s first Radio Broadcast Satellite with the US FCC. In 1992, Samara and van der Heyden (at the time representing the Republic of Indonesia) were able, at WARC-92 with the support of many African and Asian countries, to have the ITU establish a new radio frequency spectrum band dedicated to Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) in the L-band – 1,452 MHz – 1,492 MHz. After WARC-92 Samara went on to build WorldSpace and van der Heyden to build IndoVison and the Indostar S-band Direct Broadcast Satellite satellite program for Indonesia.

WorldSpace first began broadcasting satellite radio on 1 October 1999, in Africa. In a last-ditch but ultimately completely unsuccessful effort to avoid commercial insolvency in July 2008, WorldSpace changed its brand and corporate identity to 1worldspace.

Before filing for bankruptcy in October 2008, 1worldspace employed two satellites and broadcast 62 channels – 38 of which were content provided by international, national and regional third parties and 24 1worldspace-branded stations produced by or for 1worldspace. Most of the channels used to be available only through a subscription plan.

1worldspace claimed to be the only company with rights to the world&#x27;s globally allocated spectrum for digital satellite radio. However, it never made use of its license to broadcast to the Americas or the Caribbean. The company gained attention around 2000 because of its willingness to invest in impoverished areas and from 2006 to the present due to its financial difficulties and bankruptcy proceedings.

European operations were liquidated in the spring of 2009. On December 25, 2009, the company issued notices to all of its subscribers in India that WorldSpace service in India would officially be terminated from December 31, 2009, with no refunds given to its subscribers, on account of bankruptcy. The company was known as AfriSpace until 1992 when it changed its name to &quot;WorldSpace&quot; until July 2008.

For a while Liberty Media (a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group) sought to buy the assets, but in June 2010, a company called Yazmi USA owned by former WorldSpace founder, chairman, and CEO Noah Samara purchased the remains for US$5.5M.

On 18 July 2011, Forbes India reported that Timbre Media was re-launching WorldSpace Radio in association with Sa Re Ga Ma in September 2011, although it would only be streamed through mobile phones, the Internet and direct-to-home television networks. Reportedly, old WorldSpace receivers would no longer work. The re-launch would start with 40 stations and eventually have as many as 120 stations, including sub-categories such as music for cardio-workouts.

==Content==
1worldspace assembled a combination of news, sports, music, brand name content and educational programming which it delivered to its market in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The 62 channels (38 of which were third-party content and 24 of which were produced by or for 1worldspace) represented popular international music formats including contemporary hits, country, classic rock and jazz with content specific to the local geographic region. Sports coverage included content from Fox Sports Radio and talkSPORT in addition to regional coverage. 1worldspace also broadcast news from well-renowned sources such as BBC, CNBC, CNN, NPR, RFI, and WRN. Additional content included channels that highlighted poetry and literature, comedy, talk shows, and inspirational and religious programming.

1worldspace&#x27;s program directors and announcers operated from studios in Washington, D.C., Bangalore, and Nairobi, where 18 original music and lifestyle channels were created for distribution. Four of these stations were previously available in the United States on the XM Satellite Radio network. This arrangement ended in 2008.

==System==
The 1worldspace system had three major components: the space segment, the ground segment, and the user segment. The space segment referred to the company-owned satellites that broadcast the signals over a large percentage of the eastern hemisphere. The ground segment referred to the operating and broadcasting centers. The user segment referred to the user-owned devices in which the signal was received. In addition, the company planned to implement terrestrial repeater networks in order to facilitate access to new markets in Europe and the Middle-East.

The 1worldspace system was built with companies including Alcatel Space (now Thales Alenia Space), EADS Astrium and Arianespace (France), SED (Canada), GSI (USA), Fraunhofer Society (Germany), ST Microelectronics (Italy), Micronas (Germany) and others.

===Space segment===
1worldspace operated two satellites: AfriStar and AsiaStar. This made it available in Asia, Africa, Middle East, and parts of Europe.

The company ordered also a third satellite, AmeriStar (also known as CaribStar and later renamed AfriStar 2). This satellite was built but never launched. A fourth satellite, WorldStar 4, was also considered and some components were acquired. However, the whole WorldStar 4 satellite was never built.

===Ground segment===
The regional operations centers for the satellites were located in Silver Spring, Maryland for AfriStar and Melbourne, Australia for AsiaStar. These centers managed the performance and status of the satellites by controlling them and monitoring there. The system architecture is identical for each region.

Telemetry, command and ranging (TCR) ground stations consisted of an X-Band uplink command and control system and an L-Band telemetry monitoring system. A backup mode was also provided using an S-Band link from Bangalore, India. Each satellite had two TCR stations with sufficient geographic distance between them so that if natural disasters or any unforeseen events were to make one inoperable, a back-up station would be available. The TCR stations for AfriStar were located in Bangalore, India and Port Louis, Mauritius, and the ones for AsiaStar in Melbourne, Australia and Port Louis, Mauritius.

In addition to the TCR stations, a communications system monitoring station (CSM) was associated with each satellite to monitor continuously the quality of the downlink services. The CSM facilities were located in Libreville, Gabon and Johannesburg, South Africa for AfriStar and Melbourne, Australia for AsiaStar.

===User segment===
Users purchased receivers compatible with the L-Band frequency in order to access the system. The radio receiver processed, decoded and descrambled the signals to allow users to receive programming content. The company&#x27;s broadcast frequency and satellites required a special receiver design incorporating either a small patch antenna measuring approximately 6 to 8 cm (2.4 to 3.2 inches) which folded neatly into the receiver unit or a similarly sized omni-directional antenna mounted on the car rooftop. Each receiver was individually addressable via a unique identifier that could be used to unlock specially coded audio or multimedia signals. This capability provided the flexibility to deliver free, subscription and/or premium services to consumers.

The currently available receivers were manually coded for subscription authorization. A password, valid for varying periods of time depending upon the length of the subscription purchased and paid for, is provided to a subscriber and entered into the receiver. Passwords were re-validated on a quarterly basis. Upon subscription renewal, a new passcode was provided and similarly entered into the receiver. As new receiver products were introduced, there were plans to provide over-the-air activation of subscriptions.

The radio sets, or receivers, which could pick up 1worldspace signals were manufactured by South Korea&#x27;s AMI, India&#x27;s BPL and China&#x27;s Tongshi, among other corporations. Discontinued models were manufactured by JVC, Sanyo, Hitachi, and Panasonic. The radios consisted of a satellite receiver plus an antenna that has to be placed in clear view of the relevant satellite, and properly oriented to the user&#x27;s geographic azimuth and elevation. A new receiver manufactured by Delphi using open standard ETSI Satellite Digital Radio technology would have been used in Europe if the company had entered the car satellite radio receiver marketplace.

===Debt===
1worldspace finally became insolvent in 2009/2010 after a prolonged series of financial crises. In the first quarter of 2008 the company lost a net total of 2,676 subscribers and reported that it would scale back its marketing activities around the world. WorldSpace recorded a $36.0 million net loss in the second quarter of 2008, as compared to a net loss of $51.2 million in the second quarter of 2007. Throughout 2008 and 2009 company was in deep debt and was reported to owe its creditors over $50 million, due to be paid by various repeatedly postponed deadlines.

===Bankruptcy===
The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 17 October 2008. The reorganization includes a 90-day $13 million &quot;debtor-in-possession financing&quot; approach, with the hopes of obtaining added funds to repay senior secured notes and convertible notes. The company&#x27;s wholly owned India affiliate was not covered by the bankruptcy filing.

===High-profile resignations===
In August 2008, two of the top executives of 1worldspace announced their resignations. Greg Armstrong, co-COO, left effective on August 1 and Alexander Brown, co-COO, has given notice of his intention to leave.

==Promotional information==
WorldSpace audio advertisements in 2006 highlighted the company&#x27;s ability to provide communication and data-transmission services to remote areas of the world, particularly in a disaster-relief context. The promotions also mentioned WorldSpace&#x27;s facilitation of long-distance educational projects in Africa. The ads, broadcast on Washington D.C. radio stations, appeared aimed at government procurement officials and possibly NGOs.

WorldSpace named noted Indian composer A.R. Rahman as its brand ambassador in India where 90% of its customers are located, and unveiled an integrated marketing communication campaign across print and visual media featuring an exclusive signature tune composed by Mr. Rahman.

==Philanthropy==
WorldSpace Foundation was a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization created in 1997 with the aim of improving literacy in Africa, and providing content through satellite to smaller community radio stations in the continent. WorldSpace Foundation has changed its name to First Voice International.

First Voice International was a non-profit organization that tried to ensure that people living in poverty and remote places get the information they need to improve their lives, have the means to communicate their needs and wants, are able to share what they know with others – in their own voice. The organization attempted to reach the most people for the least cost by combining satellite and other technologies. By bypassing the isolating effects of illiteracy and remoteness, the organization routinely delivers information to people in areas lacking electricity, telephone or Internet service.

==Historic plans for service development==
Since uninterrupted line of sight reception may be difficult in the urban areas, a need to install terrestrial repeating transmitters to rebroadcast the satellite signals in the largest metropolitan areas of intended mobile DARS markets was identified. The company had been licensed to build networks of terrestrial repeaters in Italy, Switzerland and Germany. With this addition, the system could have provided more reliable broadcast services to receivers in automobiles. 1worldspace had planned to start providing mobile radio and data services in Italy using a combination of satellite and terrestrial broadcasts in late 2009. It had signed an agreement with Fiat, an Italian automobile manufacturer, to make radios capable of receiving the signals available to car owners. Fiat had planned to make such radios available as a bookable option made prior to purchasing a car. If the service had been launched and had been a commercial success in Italy, it was then planned to make similar services available in Germany and Switzerland. 1worldspace would have used ETSI Satellite Digital Radio (SDR) open standard in the new European coverage beam. The receivers for the new markets would have been manufactured by Delphi and would have delivered a gap-free coverage to vehicles similar to that of Sirius XM Radio vehicular mobile service.

<text>The Danziger Höhe (i.e. Danzig Heights; Kreis Danziger Höhe) was an administrative district founded in 1887 and dissolved in 1939. The district administration was based in the City of Danzig, which itself did not form part of the district but was an independent city (Stadtkreis). The area Danziger Höhe covered is now within Poland.

==History==
The district was formed from parts of the previous within the Danzig Region in the province of West Prussia, within the Kingdom of Prussia, itself a part of Germany since 1871. In 1910, the district had 53,506 inhabitants, of which 23,955 were Protestant and 29,206 were Catholic. 9.7% had officially declared that they spoke the Kashubian language.

After the First World War, when the Treaty of Versailles came into effect in 1920, Danziger Höhe became a district in the new Free City of Danzig. The district was enlarged by a number of municipalities from neighbouring West Prussian districts of Neustadt, Karthaus, Berent and Dirschau, which otherwise became part of the Second Polish Republic as part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Some municipalities in the Danziger Höhe district were also ceded to Poland.

== Demographics ==
The district had a majority German population, with minorities of Kashubians and Poles.

<text>The Living Daylights is a 1987 spy film, the fifteenth entry in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series produced by Eon Productions, and the first of two to star Timothy Dalton as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by John Glen, the film&#x27;s title is taken from Ian Fleming&#x27;s short story &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, the plot of which also forms the basis of the first act of the film. It was the last film to use the title of an Ian Fleming story until the 2006 instalment &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. It is also the first film to have Caroline Bliss as Miss Moneypenny, replacing Lois Maxwell. The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli, his stepson Michael G. Wilson, and co-produced by his daughter, Barbara Broccoli. &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; grossed $191.2 million worldwide.

==Plot==
James Bond is assigned to help KGB General Georgi Koskov defect to the West, acting as a counter-sniper covering his escape from a concert hall in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. During the mission, Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to &quot;protect&quot; Koskov is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he shoots the rifle from the cellist, then uses the Trans-Siberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov across the border to the West.

In his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs MI6 that the KGB&#x27;s old policy of &quot;Smert Shpionam&quot;, meaning &quot;Death to Spies&quot;, has been reactivated by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the Blayden estate safe-house and is assumed to have been taken back to Moscow. Bond is ordered to track down Pushkin in Tangier and kill him, to stop further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. Bond agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004 in Gibraltar (as depicted in the pre-title sequence) left a note reading &quot;Smiert Spionam&quot;.

Bond returns to Bratislava to track down the cellist, Kara Milovy. He finds out that Koskov&#x27;s defection was faked, and that Kara is actually Koskov&#x27;s girlfriend. Bond convinces Kara that he is a friend of Koskov&#x27;s and persuades her to accompany him to Vienna, supposedly to be reunited with him. They escape Bratislava while being pursued by the KGB and Czech police, crossing over the border into Austria. Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker.

During his brief journey with Kara in Vienna, Bond visits the Prater to meet his MI6 ally, Saunders, who discovers a history of financial dealings between Koskov and Whitaker. As he leaves their meeting, Saunders is killed by Koskov&#x27;s henchman Necros, who again leaves the message &quot;Smert&#x27; Shpionam&quot;. Bond and Kara promptly leave for Tangier. There, Bond confronts Pushkin, who denies any knowledge of &quot;Smert&#x27; Shpionam&quot; and reveals that Koskov is evading arrest for embezzlement of government funds. Bond and Pushkin then join forces, and Bond fakes Pushkin&#x27;s assassination, causing Whitaker and Koskov to progress with their scheme. Meanwhile, Kara contacts Koskov, who tells her that Bond is actually a KGB agent and convinces her to drug him so that he can be captured.

Koskov, Necros, Kara, and the drugged Bond fly to a Soviet air base in Afghanistan, where Koskov betrays Kara and imprisons her, along with Bond. The pair escape, and in doing so, free a condemned prisoner, Kamran Shah, leader of the local Mujahideen. Bond and Kara discover that Koskov is using Soviet funds to buy a massive shipment of opium from the Mujahideen, intending to keep the profits with enough left over to supply the Soviets with their arms and buy Western arms from Whitaker.

With the Mujahideen&#x27;s help, Bond plants a bomb aboard the cargo plane carrying the opium but is discovered and has no choice but to barricade himself in the plane. Meanwhile, the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Kara drives a jeep into the cargo hold of the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also jumps onboard at the last second from a jeep driven by Koskov. After a fight, Bond sends Necros falling to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He re-activates the bomb and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men escape the Soviets. The plane subsequently crashes, destroying the drugs, while Bond and Kara escape.

Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, infiltrating his estate with the help of Felix Leiter. Pushkin arrests Koskov, ordering him to be sent back to Moscow &quot;in the diplomatic bag&quot;.

Sometime later, Kara is the solo cellist in a Vienna performance. Kamran Shah and his men jostle in during the intermission and are introduced to now-diplomat General Gogol (Pushkin&#x27;s predecessor at the KGB), and the Soviets. After her performance, Bond surprises Kara in her dressing room, and they embrace.

==Production==
Originally the film was proposed to be a prequel in the series, an idea that eventually resurfaced with the reboot of the series in 2006, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. SMERSH, the fictionalised Soviet counterintelligence agency that featured in Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and several other early James Bond novels, was an acronym for &#x27;Smiert Shpionam&#x27; —&#x27;Death to Spies&#x27;.

===Casting===
In autumn 1985, following the mixed reception of &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, work began on scripts for the next Bond film, with the intention that Roger Moore would not reprise the role of James Bond. Moore, who by the time of the release of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; would have been 59 years old, chose to retire from the role after 12 years and seven films. Albert Broccoli, however, claimed that he let Moore go from the role.

During an extensive search for a new actor to play Bond, a number of actors, including New Zealander Sam Neill, Irish-born Pierce Brosnan, and Welsh-born stage actor Timothy Dalton, auditioned for the role in 1986. Bond co-producer Michael G. Wilson, director John Glen, Dana and Barbara Broccoli &quot;were impressed with Sam Neill and very much wanted to use him.&quot; However, Albert Broccoli was not sold on the actor. In 2022, Neill stated that he had never wanted the role. Meanwhile, Jerry Weintraub, the chairman of MGM/UA Communications, suggested hiring Mel Gibson for a two-picture deal valued at $10 million, but Broccoli was not interested. Other actors touted in the press included Bryan Brown, Michael Nader, Andrew Clarke, and Finlay Light.
The producers eventually offered the role to Brosnan after a three-day screen-test. At the time, he was contracted to the television series &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, which had been cancelled by the NBC network due to falling ratings. The announcement that he would be chosen to play James Bond caused a surge in interest in the series, which led to NBC exercising (less than three days prior to expiry) a 60-day option in Brosnan&#x27;s contract to make a further season of the series. NBC&#x27;s action caused drastic repercussions, as a result of which Broccoli withdrew the offer given to Brosnan, citing that he did not want the character associated with a contemporary television series. This led to a drop in interest in &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, and only five new episodes were filmed before the series was finally cancelled. The edict from Broccoli was that &quot;&quot;Remington Steele&quot; would not be James Bond.&quot;

Dana Broccoli suggested Timothy Dalton. Albert Broccoli was initially reluctant given Dalton&#x27;s public lack of interest in the role, but at his wife&#x27;s urging agreed to meet the actor. However, Dalton would soon begin filming &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; and so would be unavailable. In the intervening period, having completed &quot;Brenda Starr&quot;, Dalton was offered the role once again, which he accepted. For a period, the filmmakers had Dalton, but he had not signed a contract. A casting director persuaded Robert Bathurst—an English actor who would become known for his roles in &quot;Joking Apart&quot;, &quot;Cold Feet&quot;, and &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;—to audition for Bond.

Bathurst believes that his &quot;ludicrous audition&quot; was only &quot;an arm-twisting exercise&quot; because the producers wanted to persuade Dalton to take the role by telling him they were still auditioning other actors. Dalton agreed to the film while travelling between airports: &quot;Without anything to do, I decided to start thinking about whether I really, really should or should not do James Bond. Although obviously we&#x27;d moved some way along in that process, I just wasn&#x27;t set on whether I should do it or shan&#x27;t I do it. But the moment of truth was fast approaching as to whether I&#x27;d say yes or no. And that&#x27;s where I said yes. I picked up the phone from the hotel room in the Miami airport and called them and said, &quot;Yep, you&#x27;re on: I&#x27;ll do it.&quot;

Dalton&#x27;s take was very different from that of Moore, regarded as more in line of Ian Fleming&#x27;s character: a reluctant hero who is often uncomfortable in his job. Dalton wished to create a Bond different from Moore&#x27;s, feeling he would have declined the project if he were asked to imitate Moore. In contrast to Moore&#x27;s more jocular approach, Dalton found his creative muse from the original books: &quot;I definitely wanted to recapture the essence and flavour of the books, and play it less flippantly. After all, Bond&#x27;s essential quality is that he&#x27;s a man who lives on the edge. He could get killed at any moment, and that stress and danger factor is reflected in the way he lives, chain-smoking, drinking, fast cars and fast women.&quot;

Moore declined to watch &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; in cinema as he did not wish to demonstrate any negative opinions about the project. Broccoli enjoyed the change of tone, feeling that Brosnan would have been too similar to Moore. Neill thought Dalton performed well in the role, and Brosnan called Dalton a good choice in 1987, but felt it too near the bone to watch the finished film. He would win the role in 1994, based on his filmed audition from 1986. Sean Connery endorsed Dalton in an interview with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and Desmond Llewelyn enjoyed working with a fellow stage actor.

The English actress Maryam d&#x27;Abo, a former model, was cast as the Czechoslovak cellist Kara Milovy. In 1984, d&#x27;Abo had attended auditions for the role of Pola Ivanova in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. Barbara Broccoli included d&#x27;Abo in the audition for playing Kara, which she later passed.

Originally, the KGB general set up by Koskov was to be General Gogol; however, Walter Gotell was too sick to handle the major role, and the character of Leonid Pushkin replaced Gogol, who appears briefly at the end of the film, having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service. This was Gogol&#x27;s final appearance in a James Bond film. Morten Harket, the lead vocalist of the Norwegian rock group a-ha (who performed the film&#x27;s title song), was offered a minor role as a henchman but declined, because of lack of time and because he felt they wanted to cast him due to his popularity rather than his acting. Joe Don Baker was hired based on his performance in &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, which was helmed by future Bond director Martin Campbell.

Director John Glen decided to include the macaw from &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;. It can be seen squawking in the kitchen of Blayden House when Necros attacks MI6&#x27;s officers.

===Filming===

The film was shot at Pinewood Studios at its 007 Stage in the United Kingdom, as well as Weissensee in Austria. The pre-title sequence was filmed on the Rock of Gibraltar and although the sequence shows a hijacked Land Rover careening down various sections of road for several minutes before bursting through a wall towards the sea, the location mostly used the same short stretch of road at the very top of the Rock, shot from numerous different angles. The beach defences seen at the foot of the Rock in the initial shot were also added solely for the film, to an otherwise non-military area. The action involving the Land Rover switched from Gibraltar to Beachy Head in the UK for the shot showing the vehicle actually getting airborne.

Trial runs of the stunt with the Land Rover, during which Bond escapes by parachute from the tumbling vehicle, were filmed in the Mojave Desert in the southwestern United States, although the final cut of the film uses a shot achieved using a dummy. Bratislava sequences were filmed in Vienna. The outside shots of the Bratislava concert hall show the Volksoper, while the interiors were shot in the Sofiensäle. The tram scene was filmed in Währing, Vienna and the border chase was filmed in Carinthia, including the town of Nassfeld, on the Austrian/Italian border. The location used for the home of villain Whitaker was the Forbes Museum in Tangier, Morocco, while desert scenes were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The conclusion of the film was shot at the Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna and Elveden Hall, Suffolk.

Principal photography commenced at Gibraltar on 17 September 1986. Aerial stuntmen B. J. Worth and Jake Lombard performed the pre-credits parachute jump. Both the terrain and wind were unfavourable. Consideration was given to the stunt being done using cranes but aerial stunts arranger B. J. Worth stuck to skydiving and completed the scenes in a day. The aircraft used for the jump was a Lockheed C-130 Hercules, which in the film had M&#x27;s office installed in the aircraft cabin. The initial point of view for the scene shows M in what appears to be his usual London office, but the camera then zooms out to reveal that it is, in fact, inside an aircraft.

Although marked as a Royal Air Force aircraft, the one in shot belonged to the Spanish Air Force and was used again later in the film for the Afghanistan sequences, this time in Soviet markings. During this later chapter, a fight breaks out on the open ramp of the aircraft in flight between Bond and Necros, before Necros falls to his death. Although the plot and preceding shots suggest the aircraft is a C-130, the shot of Necros falling away from the aircraft show a twin engine cargo plane, a Fairchild C-123 Provider. Worth and Lombard also doubled for Bond and Necros in the scenes where they are hanging and fighting on a bag in a plane&#x27;s open cargo door, with the exterior shots filmed over the Mojave Desert in the United States.

The press would not meet Dalton and d&#x27;Abo until 5 October 1986, when the main unit travelled to Vienna. Almost two weeks after the second unit filming on Gibraltar, the first unit started shooting with Andreas Wisniewski and stunt man Bill Weston. During the course of the three days it took to film this fight, Weston fractured a finger and Wisniewski knocked him out once. The next day found the crew on location at Stonor House, Oxfordshire, doubling for Blayden&#x27;s Safe House, the first scene Jeroen Krabbé filmed.

d&#x27;Abo recalled we were &quot;[o]ne big and happy family traveling and filming together for five months.&quot;

====The return of Aston Martin====

The film reunites Bond with the car maker Aston Martin. Following Bond&#x27;s use of the Aston Martin DBS in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, the filmmakers then turned to the brand new Lotus Esprit in 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, which reappeared four years later in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;. Aston Martin then returned with their Aston Martin V8.

Two different Aston Martin models were used in filming—a V8 Volante convertible, and later for the Czechoslovakia scenes, a hard-top non-Volante V8 saloon badged to look like the Volante. The Volante was a production model owned by then Aston Martin Lagonda chairman, Victor Gauntlett.

===Music===

&quot;The Living Daylights&quot; was the final Bond film to be scored by composer John Barry. The soundtrack is notable for its introduction of sequenced electronic rhythm tracks overdubbed with the orchestra—at the time, a relatively new innovation.

The title song of the film, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, was co-written with Pål Waaktaar of the Norwegian pop-music group a-ha and recorded by the band. The group and Barry did not collaborate well, resulting in two versions of the theme song. Barry&#x27;s film mix is heard on the soundtrack (and on a-ha&#x27;s later compilation album &quot;Headlines and Deadlines&quot;). The version preferred by the band can be heard on the a-ha album &quot;Stay on These Roads&quot;, released in 1988. However, in 2006, Waaktaar complimented Barry&#x27;s contributions: &quot;I loved the stuff he added to the track, I mean it gave it this really cool string arrangement. That&#x27;s when for me it started to sound like a Bond thing&quot;. The title song is one of the few 007 title songs not performed or written by a British or American performer.

In a departure from previous Bond films, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; was the first to use different songs over the opening and end credits. The song heard over the end credits, &quot;If There Was A Man&quot; (which also acts as the &quot;love theme&quot; of the film), was one of two songs performed for the film by The Pretenders, with Chrissie Hynde on lead vocals. The other song, &quot;Where Has Everybody Gone?&quot;, is heard from Necros&#x27;s Walkman in the film—the melody of the song is subsequently used in the score to announce Necros whenever he attacks. The Pretenders were originally considered to perform the title song. However, the producers had been pleased with the commercial success of Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, and felt that a-ha would be more likely to make an impact on the charts.

The original soundtrack was released on LP and CD by Warner Bros. and featured only 12 tracks. Later re-releases by Rykodisc and EMI added nine additional tracks, including alternate instrumental end credits music. Rykodisc&#x27;s version included the gun barrel and opening sequence of the film as well as the jailbreak sequence, and the bombing of the bridge.

Additionally, the film featured a number of pieces of classical music, as the main Bond girl, Kara Milovy, is a cellist. Mozart&#x27;s 40th Symphony in G minor (1st movement) is performed by the orchestra at the Conservatoire in Bratislava when Koskov flees. As Moneypenny tells Bond, Kara is next to perform Alexander Borodin&#x27;s String Quartet in D major, and the finale to Act II of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (in Vienna) also features. When arriving in Vienna, an orchestra outside the hotel in playing a movement from the Wein, Weib und Gesang waltz by Johann Strauss. Before Bond is drugged by Kara, she is practicing the Cello solo from the first movement of Dvořák&#x27;s cello concerto in B minor., Kara and an orchestra (conducted onscreen by John Barry) perform Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Rococo Theme&quot; to rapturous applause.

==Release==

In the three days following the premiere, the film grossed £52,656 in Leicester Square and £13,049 at the Odeon Marble Arch before expanding to 18 screens where it grossed £136,503 for the weekend, finishing third at the UK box office for the weekend and second for the week behind &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;. The following week it expanded to 60 screens and grossed £252,940 for the weekend, finishing second to &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot;. A week later it expanded to 116 screens but remained in second place for the weekend with a gross of £523,264 however finally reached number one for the week with a gross of £1,072,420 from 131 screens. It went on to gross £8.2 million ($19 million) in the UK. On the film&#x27;s opening weekend in the US, it grossed $11 million, surpassing the $5.2 million grossed by &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; that was released on the same day, and setting a record 3-day opening for a Bond film, beating &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983) $8.9 million. However, it did not beat the 4-day record of $13.3 million set by &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985). It went on to gross $51.2 million in the United States and Canada. &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; grossed the equivalent of $191.2 million worldwide. Other large international grosses include $19.5 million in Germany, $12.6 million in Japan and $11.4 million in France.

In the film, Koskov and Whitaker repeatedly use vehicles and drug packets marked with the Red Cross. This action angered a number of Red Cross Societies, which sent letters of protest regarding the film. In addition, the British Red Cross attempted to prosecute the filmmakers and distributors. However, no legal action was taken. As a result, a disclaimer was added at the start of the film and some DVD releases.

==Reception==
Rita Kempley, reviewing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, praised Dalton&#x27;s performance, naming him: Furthermore, she praised the film as &quot;graciously paced, though overplotted, so some seat-shifting sets in about 30 minutes before the end.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; complimented Dalton&#x27;s performance, feeling that he had &quot;enough presence, the right debonair looks and the kind of energy that the Bond series has lately been lacking.&quot; While praising the supporting characters, she criticised the long runtime and noted Glen&#x27;s direction &quot;has the colorful but perfunctory style that goes with the territory, and it&#x27;s adequate if uninspired.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; two stars out of four, criticising the lack of humour in the protagonist and feeling General Whitaker was &quot;not one of the great Bond villains. He&#x27;s a kooky phony general who plays with toy soldiers and never seems truly diabolical. Without a great Bond girl, a great villain or a hero with a sense of humor, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; belongs somewhere on the lower rungs of the Bond ladder. But there are some nice stunts.&quot; Gene Siskel of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave the film two stars out of four, commending Dalton as superior to Roger Moore but feeling he &quot;simply doesn&#x27;t have the manliness or the charm of Sean Connery.&quot; He criticised the film for its perceived tentativeness, writing that the &quot;filmmakers were trying to strike a middle ground between the glamor of the Connery Bond films and the dubious humor of the Moore Bonds. The result is a film that is not so much bad as mechanical and uptight.&quot;

Carrie Rickey of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; felt Dalton &quot;makes for an appealing Bond, and with his distinctive bow-shaped mouth and the cleft in his chin, no one is likely to confuse [him] with the blandness that was George Lazenby or the corseted stiffness that was Roger Moore, two prior Bonds. And unlike Sean Connery&#x27;s cooly sadistic agent, Dalton&#x27;s 007 has exquisite manners — both of the bedside and roadside variety.&quot; Jay Scott of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote of Dalton&#x27;s Bond that &quot;you get the feeling that on his off nights, he might curl up with the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and catch an episode of &quot;Moonlighting&quot;&quot;. Derek Malcolm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote Dalton &quot;hasn&#x27;t the natural authority of Connery nor the facile charm of Moore, but George Lazenby he is not. He is, in fact, four-square on the Balham Line — decent, daring, not above unorthodoxy but unlikely to ask Q for a fool-proof condom for the Aids era.&quot; Overall, he felt the film was &quot;a slightly more sensible Bond than before, allowing for glasnost — the Ruskies aren&#x27;t all bad — and suggesting 007 has at least grown less like a predatory little boy.&quot;

Jay Boyar of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; noted: &quot;Dalton shows a serious side that&#x27;s been missing from the role since Sean Connery&#x27;s earliest 007 days. And as a whole, the new picture is less of a special-effects affair than most of Roger Moore&#x27;s Bond films. There&#x27;s no shortage of action in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, but the movie adds up to a real adventure.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine gave the film a positive review, stating Dalton &quot;finds some of the lethal charm of Sean Connery, along with a touch of crabby Harrison Ford. This Bond is as fast on his feet as with his wits; an ironic scowl creases his face; he&#x27;s battle ready yet war-weary.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
Retrospective reviews of the film have been considerably more positive. &quot;The Independent&quot; placed the film as the fourth best Bond movie, praising the tough, nervy edge Dalton brought to the franchise. Dalton himself has said he preferred &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; over &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;. Dalton&#x27;s predecessor, Roger Moore, discussing the Bond series in 2012, called the film a &quot;bloody good movie&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; lauded the film for bringing back realism and espionage to the film series, and showing James Bond&#x27;s dark side. Les Roopanarine, in a retrospective review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, called the film his favourite Bond film, praising Dalton for &quot;bringing a more nuanced interpretation to the role, with his relationships evolving in a way never seen before in previous Bond films.&quot;

In a poll involving Bond experts and fans of the franchise, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; was ranked the sixth-best Bond film. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 73% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Newcomer Timothy Dalton plays James Bond with more seriousness than preceding installments, and the result is exciting and colorful but occasionally humorless.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 59 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on scale of A to F.

Retrospective reviews have been critical of the portrayal of the mujahideen in the film, with The Atlantic writing that the film failed to capture &quot;the complexities of their historical moment&quot;. Others have said that the film &quot;sidesteps more problematic aspects of mujahideen activities&quot; and that &quot;any critical reading of the film in light of modern Afghanistan, and the post-Soviet incarnations/evolution of the Mujahedeen, I lock securely in the box marked &#x27;Let’s Not Go There.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="566717" wikidata="Q1406638" url="?curid=566717" title="Michael Ledeen">
<text>Michael Arthur Ledeen (; born August 1, 1941) is an American historian and neoconservative foreign policy analyst. He is a former consultant to the United States National Security Council, the United States Department of State, and the United States Department of Defense. He held the Freedom Scholar chair at the American Enterprise Institute where he was a scholar for 20 years, and now holds the similarly named chair at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He was very close to Italian politician Antonio Martino. Ledeen was also noted to have done work for Italian intelligence agency SISMI, having received over $100,000 in payment to offshore bank accounts for services including but not limited to training Italian intelligence operatives. Ledeen denies these allegations but admits he did do work for SISMI and was paid for it. 

==Academic career==
Ledeen holds a Ph.D. in History and Philosophy from the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he studied under the historian George Mosse. His doctoral dissertation eventually became &quot;Universal Fascism: The Theory and Practice of the Fascist International, 1928–1936&quot;, first published in 1972. The book explored Italian leader Benito Mussolini&#x27;s efforts to create a Fascist international in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Ledeen taught at Washington University in St. Louis but left after being denied tenure. Some faculty indicated that questions about the &quot;quality of his scholarship&quot; and about whether or not Ledeen had &quot;used the work of somebody else without proper credit&quot; were issues, although some also noted that &quot;the &#x27;quasi-irregularity&#x27; at issue didn&#x27;t warrant the negative vote on tenure.&quot;

Ledeen subsequently moved to Rome, where he was hired as the Rome correspondent for &quot;The New Republic&quot; and was named a visiting professor at the University of Rome for two years until 1977. In Rome, Ledeen worked with Italian historian Renzo De Felice, who greatly influenced Ledeen, drawing a distinction between &quot;fascism-regime&quot; and &quot;fascism-movement.&quot; Ledeen&#x27;s political views developed to stress &quot;the urgency of combating centralized state power and the centrality of human freedom&quot; Ledeen continued his studies in Italian Fascism with a study of the takeover of Fiume by Italian irredentist forces under Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio, who Ledeen argued was the prototype for Mussolini.

== Billygate ==
In the 1980 lead up to the US presidential election, Ledeen, along with Arnaud de Borchgrave, wrote a series of articles published in &quot;The New Republic&quot; and elsewhere about Jimmy Carter&#x27;s brother, Billy Carter&#x27;s contacts with the Muammar al-Gaddafi regime in Libya. Ledeen testified before a Senate subcommittee that he believed that Billy Carter had met with and been paid off by Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

Five years later, in 1985, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; investigation suggested that the series of Billygate articles written by Ledeen were part of a larger disinformation campaign intended to influence the outcome of that year&#x27;s presidential election. According to the reporting, Francesco Pazienza, an officer of the Italian intelligence agency SISMI, alleged that Ledeen was paid $120,000 for his work on Billygate and other projects. Pazienza and Ledeen were very active in disinformation efforts. At SISMI, Pazienza stated, Ledeen warranted a coded identification: Z-3. Pazienza was later tried and convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; for using &quot;extortion and fraud to obtain embarrassing facts about Billy Carter&quot;.

== Bulgarian connection theory ==
Ledeen worked for the Italian military intelligence agency SISMI in 1980, providing &quot;risk assessment&quot; and consulting on extradition matters between Italy and the United States. During his time in Italy, Ledeen endorsed the &quot;Bulgarian connection&quot; conspiracy theory concerning Grey Wolves member Mehmet Ali Ağca&#x27;s 1981 attempt to assassinate Pope John Paul II. The theory has since been attacked by various authors and journalists, including &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Michael Dobbs, who initially believed the story as well. The theory was adopted in 2005 by the Italian Mitrokhin Commission. According to Craig Unger, &quot;With Ronald Reagan newly installed in the White House, the so-called Bulgarian Connection made perfect Cold War propaganda. Michael Ledeen was one of its most vocal proponents, promoting it on TV and in newspapers all over the world.&quot;

== Work in the United States ==
In the early 1980s, Ledeen appeared before the newly established Senate Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism alongside former CIA director William Colby, author Claire Sterling, and former &quot;Newsweek&quot; editor Arnaud de Borchgrave. Both Ledeen and de Borchgrave worked for the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University at the time. All four testified that they believed the Soviet Union had provided material support, training and inspiration for various terrorist groupings.

Ledeen was involved in the Iran–Contra affair as a consultant to National Security Advisor Robert C. McFarlane. Ledeen met with Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres, officials of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and the CIA to arrange meetings with high-ranking Iranian officials, whereby Iranians supported by the US would be given weapons by Israel, and would proceed to negotiate with Hizbollah for the release of hostages in Lebanon. Ledeen&#x27;s own version of the events is published in his book, &quot;Perilous Statecraft&quot;.

Ledeen vouched for Iranian intermediary Manucher Ghorbanifar. According to Adnan Khashoggi in 1985, Ghorbanifar was the head of Iranian Prime Minister Mir Hussein Mousavi&#x27;s European intelligence and Ledeen was aware of this. In one interview after the scandal broke, Ledeen stated that he initially had &quot;profound reservations&quot; about Ghorbanifar, but that he proved himself to be reliable by opening a channel to Iranian leaders. In another report in which he was described as &quot;perhaps the only person on the US side of the affair to defend Ghorbanifar&quot;, he said that he considered Ghorbanifar to be a friend.

== Yellowcake forgery allegations ==

During the summer of 2001, Alain Chouet and others with France&#x27;s DGSE investigate an alleged deal known later as &quot;Nigergate&quot; in which Iraq was trying to obtain yellowcake from a country in Africa and, by May and June 2002, they investigate any connection with Niger but find that the rumors are entirely false. Furthermore, in July 2002, the Italian SISMI and the United States CIA are informed by the French DGSE that Rocco Martino, a former Italian intelligence agent, is trying to pass fake documents about Iraq obtaining yellowcake from Niger. However, the SISMI report that a lady, who is controlled by SISMI&#x27;s Antonio Nucera, in the Niger embassy at Rome presents the fake documents in July 2002. Later, in March 2003, George Tenet incorrectly stated that Iraq, which had large quantities of yellowcake, was obtaining yellowcake from Niger.

According to a September 2004 article by Joshua Micah Marshall, Laura Rozen, and Paul Glastris in &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;: &quot;The first meeting occurred in Rome in December, 2001. It included Franklin, Rhode, and another American, the neoconservative writer and operative Michael Ledeen, who organized the meeting. (According to UPI, Ledeen was then working for Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith as a consultant.) Also in attendance was Ghorbanifar and a number of other Iranians.&quot;

Colleagues Andrew McCarthy and Mark R. Levin have defended Ledeen, writing: &quot;Up until now, the fiction recklessly spewed by disgruntled intelligence-community retirees and their media enablers—some of whom have conceded that the claim is based on zero evidence—has been that Michael had something to do with the forged Italian documents that, according to the Left&#x27;s narrative, were the basis for President Bush&#x27;s &quot;lie&quot; in the 2003 State of the Union Address that Saddam Hussein had obtained yellowcake uranium (for nuclear-weapons construction) in Africa.&quot;

==Iraq War advocacy==
During the 1990s, Ledeen was active in supporting the ousting of Saddam Hussein from Iraq. He was known as one of The Vulcans who also included John Bolton, Douglas Feith, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld, and David Wurmser who signed an &quot;An Open Letter to the President&quot; to lobby Bill Clinton to remove Hussein from office.

Regarding the &quot;pre-emptive&quot; invasion of Iraq, in 2002 Ledeen criticized the views of former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, writing:

Ledeen&#x27;s statements prior to the start of the Iraq war such as &quot;desperately needed and long overdue war against Saddam Hussein&quot; and &quot;dire need to invade Iraq&quot; caused Glenn Greenwald to label his later statement that he &quot;opposed the military invasion of Iraq before it took place&quot; to be an &quot;outright lie&quot;. However, Ledeen maintains these statements are consistent since: &quot;I opposed the military invasion of Iraq before it took place and I advocated—as I still do—support for political revolution in Iran as the logical and necessary first step in the war against the terror masters.&quot;

==Views on Iran==
Ledeen is a long-time foe of the Islamic regime of Iran. He believed that invading the country and regime change in Iran should have been the first priority in the &quot;war on terror&quot; in 2003 rather than Iraq. He believes that &quot;everything traces back to Tehran&quot; and that Iran manipulates both sides of the Shi&#x27;ite-Sunni conflict, leading reviewer Peter Beinart to note that his &quot;effort to lay virtually every attack by Muslims against Americans at Tehran&#x27;s feet takes him into rather bizarre territory.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes Ledeen&#x27;s views as &quot;everything traces back to Tehran&quot;. Ledeen&#x27;s phrase, &quot;faster, please&quot; has become a signature meme in Ledeen&#x27;s writings (it is currently the title of his blog on the Pajamas Media website) and is often referenced by neoconservative writers advocating a more forceful and broader &quot;war on terror.&quot; In 1979, Ledeen was one of the first Western writers to argue that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a &quot;clerical fascist&quot;, and that while it was legitimate to criticize the Shah&#x27;s regime, if Khomeini seized power in Iran the Iranian people would suffer an even greater loss of freedom and women would be deprived of political and social rights. He presently believes that &quot;No one in the West has yet supported Iranian democratic organizations&quot; and that &quot;aggressive support for those Iranians who wish to be free&quot; would most likely work in ending the clerical government.

According to Justin Raimondo, Ledeen &quot;holds up Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright as patsies for Khomeini—who supposedly believed that the Ayatollah overthrew Shah Reza Pahlavi because the Iranian government was &#x27;excessively repressive and intolerant.&#x27; While it would not do to come right out and deny the savagery of the Shah&#x27;s legendary SAVAK secret police, Ledeen informs us that, under the monarch&#x27;s beneficent rule, &#x27;Iran had become too modern, too tolerant—especially of women and of other religious faiths—and too self-indulgent. The shah had Westernized Iran&#x27;—except, perhaps, in his prisons, where the ancient methods of torture were routinely employed on dissidents of all sorts.&quot;

Ledeen is currently against both an invasion of Iran or air-strikes within the country. He has argued that the latter may eventually become necessary if negotiations with the Iranian government fail, but it would only be the least bad option of many options and it would lead to many negative unforeseen consequences. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has called Ledeen&#x27;s skepticism towards military action against Iran surprising given his opposition to the regime.

In July 2016 Ledeen co-authored with Lt. General Michael T. Flynn, at the time Donald Trump&#x27;s national-security adviser, &quot;The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies&quot;. Flynn and Ledeen constructed a narrative in which the world is at war with a &quot;great evil&quot; and Iran is the central player on the enemy side.

==Controversial theories==
Ledeen also believed that Iran is the main backer of the insurgency in Iraq and even supported the al-Qaida network formerly led by al-Zarqawi despite its declaration of jihad against Shi&#x27;ite Muslims. He claimed that German and Italian court documents showed Zarqawi created a European terrorist network while based in Tehran.

Ledeen was a board member of the &quot;Coalition for Democracy in Iran&quot; (CDI), founded by Morris Amitay, a former executive director of American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Ledeen had also been part of the board of the U.S. Committee for a Free Lebanon. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, quoted by &quot;Asia Times&quot;, he was the only full-time international affairs analyst regularly consulted by Karl Rove, George W. Bush&#x27;s closest advisor.

Following the February 2003 speech by French Minister for Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin at the United Nations General Assembly against the intervention in Iraq, Ledeen outlined, in a column entitled &quot;A Theory,&quot; a possibility that France and Germany, both NATO allies of the United States, &quot;struck a deal with radical Islam and with radical Arabs&quot; to use &quot;extremism and terrorism as the weapon of choice&quot; to weaken the United States. He stated, &quot;It sounds fanciful, to be sure,&quot; but that, &quot;If this is correct, we will have to pursue the war against terror far beyond the boundaries of the Middle East, into the heart of Western Europe. And there, as in the Middle East, our greatest weapons are political: the demonstrated desire for freedom of the peoples of the countries that oppose us.&quot;

Jonah Goldberg, Ledeen&#x27;s colleague at &quot;National Review&quot;, coined the term &quot;Ledeen Doctrine&quot; in a 2002 column. This tongue-in-cheek &quot;doctrine&quot; is usually summarized as &quot;Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business,&quot; which Goldberg remembered Ledeen saying in an early 1990s speech.

Ledeen has also advocated that U.S. leaders take a stronger rhetorical stance in wars on Islamic regimes and militant groups. For instance he has recommended in public talks that U.S. leaders question or challenge defeated Islamic militaries or forces regarding the apparent failure of Allah to assure their victory.

==Personal life==
Ledeen was born in Los Angeles, California.

Ledeen is an accomplished contract bridge player. He has won one American Contract Bridge League national-level tournament, the 2009 Senior Swiss Teams, on a with Karen Allison, Lea Dupont and Benito Garozzo. He has also partnered Jimmy Cayne, who oversaw the collapse of Bear Stearns firm in 2007 and 2008. Consulted by a &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist early in the episode, Ledeen suggested that his book on the leadership lessons of Machiavelli had influenced Cayne, and observed that &quot;Jimmy saw himself in Machiavelli ... you have to get rid of failure and you have to punish lack of virtue ruthlessly and all the time.&quot;

His first wife was Jenny Ledeen of St. Louis, Mo. Ledeen has three children: Simone, Gabriel, and Daniel. Simone has worked both in Iraq and Afghanistan for the Department of Defense; Gabriel is currently a lieutenant in the United States Marines Corps serving his second tour in Iraq; Daniel too is currently a lieutenant in the USMC.

He is married to his second wife, Barbara, who was a longtime staffer for Senator Chuck Grassley on the Senate Judiciary Committee until early 2021, when she retired from the Senate.

===Missing Clinton emails===
Barbara Ledeen sparked controversy in 2015 when she tried to launch her own investigation into Hillary Clinton&#x27;s emails, while a staffer for Senator Chuck Grassley on the Senate Judiciary Committee which was looking into Trump&#x27;s Russia issue. According to FBI notes, she requested the assistance of both a defense contractor and Newt Gingrich who asked Judicial Watch for financial assistance for her efforts. Judicial Watch requested another contractor to access the &quot;deep web and dark web&quot;. Matt Tate, a former British intelligence official, was approached by Peter W. Smith, an aid close to Gingrich and who was also working with Michael Flynn who is a confidant of Barbara Ledeen&#x27;s husband, who Tate said Smith was obtaining Clinton&#x27;s emails independently of Barbara Ledeen&#x27;s efforts which Grassley had told her to stop.

===Project Veritas===
To support Project Veritas in 2017 and 2018 and while she was a staff member on the Chuck Grassley led Senate Judiciary Committee, Barbara Ledeen was tasked to help discredit H.R. McMaster because he had stated that President Trump had the intelligence of a &quot;kindergartner&quot; and was an &quot;idiot.&quot; She posted numerous comments on Facebook supporting Project Veritas including &quot;We owe a lot to Erik Prince&quot; because of his efforts to support Project Veritas and many disparaging posts about McMaster. Her involvement in the campaign to discredit McMaster led to Barbara Ledeen being named as a member of the Groundswell group; she admitted passing on information to Project Veritas but said &quot;I am not part of a plot.&quot;

<text>Cobar is a town in central western New South Wales, Australia whose economy is based mainly upon base metals and gold mining. The town is by road northwest of the state capital, Sydney. It is at the crossroads of the Kidman Way and Barrier Highway. The town and the local government area, the Cobar Shire, are on the eastern edge of the outback. At the 2016 census, the town of Cobar had a population of 3,990. The Shire has a population of approximately 4,700 and an area of .

Many sights of cultural interest can be found in and around Cobar. The town retains much of its colonial 19th-century architecture. The Towsers Huts, 3 km south of town but currently inaccessible to the public, are ruins of very simple colonial dwellings from around 1870. The ancient Aboriginal rock paintings at Mount Grenfell are some of the largest and most important in Australia. The new Cobar Sound Chapel was opened in April 2022.

==History==
===Indigenous origins===

The Cobar area is part of the traditional territory of the Wongaibon people (within the Ngiyampaa language group associated with the arid plains and rocky hill country of the Central West area of NSW bordered by the Lachlan, Darling-Barwon and Bogan rivers). The name ‘Cobar’ is derived from a Ngiyampaa word – variously transcribed as &quot;kubbur&quot;, &quot;kuparr&quot;, &quot;gubarr&quot; or &quot;cuburra&quot; – for a water-hole and quarry where pigments of ochre, kaolin and blue and green copper minerals were mined for ceremonial use. Other sources claim the Aboriginal word means ‘red earth’ or ‘burnt earth’ (the ochre used for ceremonial body paint).

The Mount Grenfell Historic Site located north-west of Cobar is an important traditional meeting place with ceremonial significance. Extensive rock art at the site contains ochre and kaolin paintings of human and animal figures as well as hand stencils.

===Pastoralism===
To the pastoralists who had taken up runs along the Darling River during the 1850s the Cobar area was a waterless region between rivers. As pastoral stations became more established, tanks and wells were constructed to allow stock to be grazed in areas away from permanent watercourses (known as ‘back stations). By the mid-1860s back stations such as ‘Booroomugga’ and ‘Buckwaroon’ had been established in the Cobar locality (within the Warrego Pastoral District).

===Copper ore===

In September 1870 three contract well-sinkers, Charles Campbell, Thomas Hartman and George Gibb, were traveling south from Bourke to the Lachlan River. They had engaged two Aboriginal men, Frank and Boney, to guide them via the permanent watering places in the dry country between the rivers. Along the way they camped beside the Kubbur waterhole. The men noted the green and blue staining at the waterhole and collected some rock samples. On their journey further south the well-sinkers stopped at a shanty operated by Henry Kruge (near to the future site of Gilgunnia). Kruge’s wife, Sidwell, was from Cornwall and her family had emigrated to South Australia in the late-1840s and mined copper ore at Burra. She was able to identify the rock as containing copper. Sidwell Kruge&#x27;s assessment was confirmed when her husband smelted some of the ore samples in his blacksmith&#x27;s forge. The three men then returned to Bourke, intending to secure the ground around the Kubbur waterhole. 

In partnership with Bourke businessman Joseph Becker, Campbell, Hartman and Gibb took up a mineral conditional purchase of 40 acres at the locality. Shortly afterwards the Cobar Copper Mining Company was formed, and the lease of the mine was transferred to the company. In May 1871 it was reported that there had been “a call for tenders for drawing in copper ore from Cobar”. In July 1871 a meeting was held in Bourke “of gentlemen interested in the Cobar copper mine” and shares were “eagerly bought at £15 per share”. By the following November it was reported that “the affairs of the Cobar Copper Mine Company are in a flourishing condition, shares having rushed up from £15 to £70 and £80 per share”.

In December 1871 a correspondent visited “the new Cobar copper mine” in company with Captain Lean, the newly-appointed mining manager. The mine had been in operation for the previous four months. It was situated “on a Pine ridge, and throughout the whole length of the ridge (about half-a-mile) indications of ore are apparent”. The ore was varied, “consisting of blue and red carbonate, red and black oxide, and is of very high quality”. The writer was of the opinion the Cobar mine “promises to be one of the richest copper mines Australia has yet produced”.

The South Cobar Mining Company built a furnace at Cobar and in May 1875 commenced smelting operations. Soon afterwards two additional furnaces and a refinery were built. In December 1875 the Cobar Copper Mining Company amalgamated with the South Cobar Mining Company to form the Great Cobar Copper Mining Company Ltd. It and subsequent companies operated a number of light railways carrying ore and similar material, as well as timber for mine supports. Cobar and many mining outskirts accommodated the miners who travelled to the area in the late 1880s. The overwhelming majority of these were of Cornish Australian stock at the time.

=== Gold ===
Although Cobar is best known as a copper mining area, it has also been a significant goldfield. The first significant gold producing mine at Cobar was the Chesney Mine. The New Occidental Mine is regarded as having been the most productive gold mine in New South Wales. Gold was also produced by refining the copper smelted from copper ores, this was first done in the Great Cobar electrolytic copper refinery at Lithgow.

===Cobar township===

In March 1881 the settlement at Cobar was described as “large and scattered, as mining towns generally are, composed chiefly of huts and cottages, which lie about in all directions and cover an extensive area of ground”. The population was estimated to number 2,500 consisting “principally of miners and their families”. The township was “divided into three portions”, described as “the Government Township, the Private Township (or that upon the land taken up by or belonging to the company working the mine), and Cornish Town”, with “the mine and its appurtenances in the centre”. Most of the houses, places of business and public buildings were located in the Private Township. In the surveyed Government Township there were “very few houses indeed”. Cornish Town was described as “pretty thickly populated”. The “want of water” was described as “the great drawback to the comfort of the inhabitants of Cobar” and on a number of occasions “the people have been upon the verge of a water famine”. Government-constructed tanks relying on rainfall was the principal means of household supply and the watering of stock, supplemented by “small tanks sunk in the ground” beside many of the houses.

A description of Cobar published in April 1888 noted that “the houses generally are substantially built; many of them being of brick”, with a number of “weather-board and iron buildings and some adobe or clay houses” scattered throughout the town. The courthouse was described as “a handsome brick structure in Barton-street” with a gaol next to it. The township had nine hotels, “the principal ones being the Cobar and the Commercial”, and two banks, “the Commercial and the Joint Stock”. The writer was of the opinion that “Cobar owes its existence as a town largely to the Great Cobar Copper Mine, although the pastoral properties have also contributed in a great measure to make it a fairly prosperous inland settlement”.

Several fine heritage buildings from the late 1880s/early 1900s settlement are still in existence, including the Great Western Hotel (1898), claimed to have the longest verandah (at 91 metres) in New South Wales, the Cobar Post Office (1885), the Cobar Court House (1887) and Court House Hotel (1895) in Barton Street, as well as the Cobar Heritage and Visitor Information Centre, located in the former Mines Office (1910). On Hillston Road southeast out of town is Fort Bourke Hill, which affords a view of the town, as well as the historic Towser&#x27;s Huts, a series of stone miners&#x27; cottages dating back as early as the 1890s, possibly even the 1870s, and built by an Italian miner by the name of Antonio Tozzi.

At its peak, Cobar had a population of 10,000. It also became the regional centre for nearby mining villages, such as Elouera, Illewong, Wrightville, Dapville, and The Peak, and some further away such as Canbelego, Mount Drysdale, Nymagee and Shuttleton. However, mining operations in the area had virtually ceased by the early 1920s. In March 1919, the vast Great Cobar mine, Cobar&#x27;s main employer, closed. The Chesney Mine had used the Great Cobar&#x27;s smelters, and it too closed in March 1919. Then came the unexpected closure, due to an underground fire, of the C.S.A. Mine, located to the north of the Cobar township, at Elouera, in March 1920. The Gladstone Mine, at Wrightville closed, around May 1920, because it was reliant upon the copper smelters at the C.S.A. Mine, which closed at that time. The Occidental gold mine, at Wrightville, closed in July 1921. Last, in September 1921, hard rock mining ceased at the Mount Boppy Gold Mine, further away at Canbelego, and the remaining surface operations closed during 1922. In less than four years, all the major mines in the Cobar region had closed. The town was saved by the reopening of the old Occidental gold mine, in 1933, thereafter known as the New Occidental mine, and the Chesney Mine in 1937. These mines both closed in 1952.

By the 1930s the town&#x27;s population had dropped to little over 1,000, only to rise again and stabilise at around 3,500 through the 1970s and early 1980s. Copper mining was intermittent until 1965 when full-time operations resumed. In the 1980s, gold, silver, lead and zinc were discovered in the area, which led to a further population increase. The town&#x27;s current positive economic development is due to the affluence of the mining boom. Three important mining belts are operational in the Cobar area: the Cobar belt, the Canbelego belt and the Girilambone belt. Visits to mine sites may be arranged through the Cobar Heritage and Visitor Information Centre overlooking the open cut mine. The &quot;Festival of the Miners&#x27; Ghost&quot;, held during the last weekend in October, is a festival celebrating the spirits of the old miners.

The area of Cobar also includes the now empty sites of the former villages of Wrightville and Dapville, and the informal settlement of Cornish Town. Further away, but at locations now within the area of Cobar, are the empty sites of two other former mining settlements, Illewong and Elouera. There was also a village site at The Peak, proclaimed in 1897.

== Heritage listings ==
Cobar has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Nyngan–Cobar railway: Cobar railway station
* 47 Linsley Street: Cobar Post Office
*Nyngan Road (Barrier Highway): Cobar Visitor&#x27;s Centre / Great Cobar Heritage Centre (also known as Cobar Pastoral &amp; Mining Museum; Mining Administration Offices, Great Cobar Mines)
*Nyngan Road (Barrier Highway): Mines Office (former)

=== New Occidental Hotel fire ===
The New Occidental Hotel was a pub located on the edge of town and was built in 1879; it was known as the Star Hotel at that time. It became a significant local spot for miners as well as a common meeting place for groups and clubs in the area. In August 2014 a fire engulfed the building and resulted in the death of a firefighter who died of his injuries at Dubbo Base Hospital.

==Demographics==
According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,990 people in Cobar.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 11.8% of the population. 
* 78.5% of people were born in Australia and 83.4% of people only spoke English at home.
* The most common responses for religion were Catholic 33.8%, No Religion 18.9% and Anglican 17.1%.

==Economy==
The Cobar economy relies heavily on trade with the local mines and their employees, and consequently on world metal prices and hence is subject to great fluctuations. During 2008, after a fall of 75% in world zinc prices, one local mine cut 540 of its 655 jobs, with flow-on effects felt by many other businesses. Over the course of that year Cobar&#x27;s workforce reduced by 10%. The town has increasing benefit from being the seat of the local government area. Cobar has two primary schools, a high school, an activities youth centre and a 31-bed hospital for acute care.

=== Cobar Quid ===
The local council supports a local currency called &quot;Cobar Quid&quot;. Established in 2003 by the Cobar Business Association Inc. (CBA), Cobar Quid is a currency that encourages its residents to shop locally. This local currency is a minted medallion that can be exchanged for goods and services with accepting local businesses.

The CBA sells the coins to the local business in values of $5, $10, $20 and $50 values, and the medallions are minted by the Royal Australian Mint.

Business can redeem the medallions for cash which is controlled by the Cobar Shire Council.

==Climate==
Cobar has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;) with long, very hot summers and short, cool winters, with low rainfall that is spread rather evenly across the year. Seasonal range is considerable in both maximum and minimum temperatures. It is very sunny, with 156.1 clear days and 3,297.6 hours of sunshine annually. The highest temperature recorded at Cobar was on 26 February 1889 and again on 11 January 1939, while the lowest recorded was on 28 July 1881.

==Notable people==
*Lilliane Brady, mayor for over 20 years and the longest-serving female mayor in NSW history
* Nik Kosef, former professional rugby league footballer for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, 1996 premiership player, NSW &amp; Australia representative

<text>The Gibraltar Labour Party was a political party in Gibraltar. They described themselves as an integrationist party and stated that their formation was prompted by the need for a strong opposition to the government. They were founded and led by Daniel Feetham and former Leader of the Opposition and integrationist, Maurice Xiberras.

They opposed dialogue with Spain and wanted to change the Constitution of Gibraltar, and support the right of Gibraltarians to decide their own constitutional arrangements under the principle of self-determination. They were also in favour of devolved integration with the United Kingdom, whereby Gibraltar would keep its internal
political and fiscal autonomy but via an Act of Union would form part of the United Kingdom.

They had proposed policies for the improvement of the quality and availability of housing in Gibraltar. They proposed that no individual should serve as Chief Minister for more than two terms, and called for a more transparent form of funding of political parties.

==Elections==
In the 2003 General Election to the Gibraltar House of Assembly, the party won 9,445 votes (or 8.0% of the popular vote) and no seats. This is the largest number of votes (in terms of both percentage and actual number of votes) for a Gibraltarian political party that has not won a seat in the Legislature throughout its electoral history.

==Election results==
===&quot;Parliament of Gibraltar&quot;===
==Merger==
In 2005, the Labour Party merged with the governing Gibraltar Social Democrats, retaining the GSD name and leadership. In 2013 Daniel Feetham became the leader of the Gibraltar Social Democrats and Leader of the Opposition.

<text>Daniel Anthony Feetham KC MP is a Gibraltarian lawyer and former politician who served as Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Gibraltar Social Democrats (GSD) from 2013 to 2017.

== Political career ==
Mr Feetham was, until he stepped down in Oct 2023, the longest serving Member of Parliament on the Opposition benches. He served as Minister for Justice from 2007-2011 and was a member of the Gibraltar Social Democrats (the GSD) a centre right political party in Gibraltar. 

His father Michael Feetham and brother Nigel Feetham have both been Members of Parliament but on the socialist side of the political spectrum. His father, a Trade Unionist, was a leading member of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (the GSLP) and served as Minister for Trade and Industry from 1988-1996. His brother Nigel Feetham is currently a Government Minister for the GSLP having been elected for the first time in 2023 and holds both the portfolios that his father Michael (Trade and Industry) and Daniel (Justice) held. Both Daniel and Nigel Feetham are barristers and Kings Counsel.

Daniel Feetham had been active in politics since 2000. He addressed the UN Fourth Committee on the decolonisation of Gibraltar in 2002 and 2003 advocating devolved integration with the United Kingdom. In 2004, he introduced the then leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, to the international press for the launch of the first European Elections in which Gibraltar was allowed to vote as part of the South West of England region and helped manage the campaign in Gibraltar for the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party polled over two-thirds of the Gibraltar vote, with no other party exceeding 10% support.  From 2004 to 2006 he was a member of the Gibraltar delegation that negotiated a new Constitution with the UK and co-ordinated the yes vote campaign in the referendum on the new Constitution in 2006. The new Constitution was adopted in Gibraltar in 2007.

He served as Gibraltar&#x27;s first Minister of Justice from 2007 to 2011 with the GSD. During his time as Minister for Justice he introduced extensive reforms to criminal justice and legal system. He is also credited for the equalization of the age of consent between heterosexuals, which stood at 16 years and homosexual men, which stood at 18 years old. To do so he presented a private members bill, and openly stated in parliament that the disparity was not constitutional. Although the bill was defeated it eventually led to his own Government putting the matter before the Gibraltar Supreme Court, which agreed with Mr Feetham that the disparity was not constitutional. 

In the 2011 general election the GSD was defeated by a very narrow margin and Mr Feetham was elected to Parliament 52 votes behind the then leader Peter Caruana. The GSD had been in Government for 16 years before that defeat. Mr Feetham became deputy leader of the GSD in 2012 and in February 2013 he was elected as leader of the GSD and became Leader of the Opposition until June 2017. In Opposition the GSD voted in favour of socially progressive measures such as civil partnerships and same sex marriage. The party however advocated fiscally conservative policies and Mr Feetham vociferously criticized the GSLP-Liberal Government’s policy on debt and Government spending. 

On 2 November 2010, Mr Feetham was stabbed in the back while out walking in Library Street with his children. Police arrested the attacker while the Minister underwent emergency surgery in St. Bernard&#x27;s Hospital. His attacker was on bail at the time on charges of attempted murder of a doctor at St Bernard&#x27;s Hospital and stabbed Mr Feetham because he had been declined, by a judge, legal aid to retain an English QC to represent him rather than having local representation. The knife attack cut his spleen in half which had to be removed. Despite the serious nature of the attack Mr Feetham survived. The attacker is serving a life sentence.

Daniel Feetham was appointed one of Her Majesty&#x27;s Counsel in December 2016. He is now the Managing Director of London Law Firm, Madison Legal and practices as a barrister from 3 Hare Court in Temple. He is also a partner in largest law firm in Gibraltar, Hassans International Law Firm.

== Elections ==
In 2003, he contested the General Election as leader of the Gibraltar Labour Party which later merged with the GSD.

In 2007, he contested the General Election as a candidate for the GSD. He was elected as an MP and as Minister for Justice.

In 2013, he contested the leadership of the GSD after Peter Caruana stood down. He beat his opponent Damon Bossino and was elected GSD Leader and subsequently as Leader of the Opposition.

==Personal life==
He is married to Julia and has 3 children. Two of his children are also lawyers. His brother, Nigel Feetham KC, was a Legal Partner (and Head of Financial Services) at Hassans and is now serving as an MP and Minister for Trade and Industry, Financial Services, Gaming and Justice (the latter that Daniel served as the inaugural minister from 2007 to 2011) with the GSLP-Liberal Government since the 2023 Gibraltar general election.

<doc id="566731" wikidata="Q2624936" url="?curid=566731" title="Henry Mill">
<text>Henry Mill (c. 1683–1771) was an English inventor who patented the first typewriter in 1714. He worked as a waterworks engineer for the New River Company, and submitted two patents during his lifetime. One was for a coach spring, while the other was for a &quot;Machine for Transcribing Letters&quot;. The machine that he invented appears, from the patent, to have been similar to a typewriter, but nothing further is known. Other early developers of typewriting machines include Pellegrino Turri. Many of these early machines, including Turri&#x27;s, were developed to enable the blind to write.

==Life==
The eldest son of Andrew and Dorothy Mill, was born in 1683 or 1684; according to his epitaph he was a relation of Sir Hugh Myddelton. He obtained an appointment about 1720 as engineer to the New River Company.

Mill&#x27;s obituary notice in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; states that he erected waterworks at Northampton. He was employed by Sir Robert Walpole to carry out the water supply for Houghton Hall.

Mill in later life employed Robert Mylne as assistant. He died unmarried at his house in Strand, London on 26 December 1771, and he was buried in Breamore Church, near Salisbury, with a long epitaph to his memory. The epitaph states that he was aged 87, but he is entered in the parish register as aged 88 years.

==Inventions==
In 1706 Mill obtained a patent (No. 376) for an improvement in carriage springs, and also in 1714 another patent (No. 395) for an apparatus &quot;for impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one after another, so neat and exact as not to be distinguished from print, very useful in settlements and public records&quot;. The patent contains no description of the apparatus, but it has been regarded as the first proposal for a typewriter.

<doc id="566742" wikidata="Q5176338" url="?curid=566742" title="Council for the National Interest">
<text>The Council for the National Interest (&quot;CNI&quot;) is a 501(c)(4) non-profit, non-partisan anti-war advocacy group focused on transparency and accountability about the relationship of Israel and the United States and the impact their alliance has for other nations and individuals in other Middle East countries. Based in the United States and most active during the 2000s decade, the Council has highlighted Israel&#x27;s disposition towards its neighbors, and how Middle Eastern nations, Palestinian rights and other aspects of Middle East life &amp; relations are impacted by the Israel&#x27;s policies and its financial, trade, and military relationships with the US. They have focused on popular sentiment and perceptions in the US and the between the two countries. They highlight how these policies have impacted the fate of Palestine and, treatment of Muslims within the US since the 1990s.

== Personnel and formation ==
The CNI is aligned with The Council for the National Interest Foundation (&quot;CNIF&quot;), an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. CNI was founded in 1989 by former Congressmen Paul Findley (R-Ill.) and Pete McCloskey (R-Calif.). Its first executive director was ten-term congressman John B. Anderson (R-Ill.), who ran as an Independent candidate in the 1980 presidential election.

Other officials involved with CNI over the years include long-time president Eugene Bird, a retired career foreign service officer; Edward Peck, former Chief of Mission to Iraq deputy director of the White House Task Force on Terrorism in the Reagan Administration.; former United States Senator James Abourezk; former CNI Vice-chair David Newton, a former United States Ambassador to Iraq and Yemen, and Richard H. Curtiss, former chief inspector of the United States Information Agency.

Ambassador (ret.) Robert V. Keeley is CNI&#x27;s chair and Alison Weir is the organization&#x27;s president. Former Central Intelligence Agency officer Philip Giraldi is its executive director. Giraldi has stated that CNI has 12,000 members.

CNI was a member of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights until 2017, when it was removed for violating the campaign&#x27;s policy on antisemitism, due to Giraldi&#x27;s expression of antisemitism in an article for the &quot;Unz Review&quot;.

==Activities==

===Position statements===
CNI issues position statements, articles and recommendations on Middle East-related issues and is quoted in mainstream and Middle East media.
* In 1988 CNI President Eugene Bird wrote about Israel&#x27;s ignoring United States State Department complaints about detention and possible torture of U.S. citizens. In early 2002, Eugene Bird criticized then-United States President George W. Bush for supporting Israel&#x27;s policies in the occupied West Bank.
* In 2003, CNI called for the Senate to reject Daniel Pipes as a trustee of the United States Institute of Peace, charging he had &quot;gone out of his way to say insulting things to Arabs, Palestinians, Muslim Americans, Black Muslims, Muslims and Islam.&quot;
* In 2004 it opined on the probable transfer of power from Yasser Arafat to his successor.* &quot;Analysis: Preparing the post-Arafat era&quot; (2004)
* In 2005 a representative criticized a World Bank&#x27;s proposed plan to give Palestinians money to enhance check points, noting that if those checkpoints were in the occupied territories it was against international law.
* After the U.S. Congress gave Israel a vote of confidence during its 2006 bombing of Lebanon, Eugene Bird said, &quot;This is the usual problem with any resolution that talks about Israel—there are a lot of closet naysayers (in Congress), but they don&#x27;t want to be a target of the lobby of Israel.&quot;
* In October 2006, CNI published a piece on the negative effect of Christian Zionists on U.S. foreign policy, and held a forum on the topic featuring Reverend Bob Edgar of the National Council of Churches.
* In April 2006, after professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt produced their disputed paper entitled &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot;, CNI&#x27;s Paul Findley told National Public Radio he was pleased about the paper and said &quot;I think I can pose as a foremost expert on the lobby for Israel, because I was the target the last three years I was in Congress.&quot;
* In the first days of the 2008–2009 Gaza War, CNI issued a statement comparing the attacks to the 1960 Sharpeville massacre where the South African apartheid regime killed 69 protesters, leading eventually to sanctions against the regime. In August 2009, Paul Findley was quoted by &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; as saying that President Obama&#x27;s demands Israel stop the settlements had made him a target of the Israel lobby in the United States.

=== Draft legislation ===
In 2004, CNI proposed the &quot;Israel Accountability and Security Act of 2004&quot;. It called upon Israel to dismantle all existing settlements outside of the 1967 border, to halt construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier, to end home demolitions in the West Bank and Gaza, and to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and join a Middle East non-proliferation treaty, and to engage in &quot;serious and unconditional&quot; negotiations with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon. Noncompliance would result in U.S.-imposed diplomatic, military and economic sanctions. It also commissioned a Zogby poll which found 56 per cent of Americans agreed that Congress should pass such a bill. The bill never became law.

===Israel lobby in the United States===

CNI representatives have signed on to joint initiatives, as Eugene Bird did to the 2004 letter by 60 former U.S. diplomats who distributed a letter critical of President George W. Bush&#x27;s &quot;endorsement of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&#x27;s unilateral plan to reject the rights of three million Palestinians, to deny the right of refugees to return to their homeland, and to retain five large illegal settlement blocs in the occupied West Bank&quot;, reversing &quot;long-standing American policy in the Middle East&quot;. In February 2005, CNI joined other concerned organizations in a meeting with Department of State officials regarding Israeli mistreatment of Palestinian American prisoners and called for the release of some of the prisoners. In May 2005, CNI joined with more than a dozen groups to protest the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) convention. In July 2006, CNI co-sponsored a protest of over 400 people at the Israeli Embassy during the 2006 Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah. In 2007 CNI joined 30 other groups calling for the U.S. government to obtain detailed site information on Israel&#x27;s cluster bomb strikes in Lebanon during its 2006 attacks on that nation. In 2012, the Council&#x27;s director Alison Weir participated in a panel on AIPAC during the &quot;Occupy AIPAC&quot; conference in Washington, D.C., that was organized by a number of antiwar and pro-Palestinian groups.

===Polls===

CNI has commissioned several polls. A 2003 Zogby International poll showed that while 56% of Americans strongly support or somewhat support a Palestinian state, 30% somewhat or strongly oppose a Palestinian state while 14% were not sure. A mid-2004 Zogby poll found that half of all likely American voters agreed that Democratic Party presidential candidate John Kerry &quot;should adopt an entirely new policy, different from the present administration, toward Israel.&quot; A 2006 Zogby poll on the Iraq war found that a nearly equal number of likely American voters (40 to 39 percent) agreed or disagreed with the proposition that &quot;the work of the Israel lobby on Congress and the Bush administration has been a key factor for going to war in Iraq and now confronting Iran.&quot;

===Conferences and hearings===
In April 2002, CNI&#x27;s Foundation sponsored a four-day conference titled &quot;Rescue U.S. Middle East Policy and Challenge the Lobby&quot; meant to draw attention to what it believed was the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s lop-sided pro-Israeli policies. Speakers included former members of the United States Congress, representatives of Palestinian and Arab groups who recently had witnessed Israeli demolition of West Bank refugee camps during &quot;Operation Defensive Shield&quot;, and members of the media who discussed the media&#x27;s role in foreign policy. Conference attendees also spent a full day lobbying members of congress.

CNI conducts public hearings on Capitol Hill. Noteworthy events included a June 2004 event CNI co-sponsored with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a presentation on &quot;The Muslim Vote in 2004&quot; where independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader complained that &quot;Muslim Americans are only the latest religious and ethnic group to feel the brunt of political hysteria and abuse&quot; and commented about Israeli leaders &quot;The days when the chief Israeli puppeteer comes to the United States and meets with the puppet in the White House and then proceeds to Capitol Hill, where he meets with hundreds of other puppets, should be replaced.&quot; This led to a heated debate with the Anti-Defamation League. The Council for the National Interest partnered with the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, a Holocaust denial conference held in Tehran, Iran in 2006.

Other hearings include a 2004 hearing &quot;Voting to Reverse the Neocons&quot;, a January 2006 hearing featuring Palestinian envoy Afif Safieh and a mid-2006 hearing on &quot;The Politics of Starvation: The Humanitarian Crisis in Palestine&quot;. In 2008 CNI sponsored a hearing on the dangers of United States&#x27; uncritical support for Israel which featured professor John Mearsheimer.

===Advertisements===
In 2005 and 2010, CNI paid for full-page ads in &quot;The New York Times&quot; promoting its positions. In 2004 it paid for an ad in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; that criticized Israel for conducting espionage and covert operations against the United States and for erecting an &quot;apartheid wall&quot; separating Israel and Palestinians and building illegal settlements. AIPAC replied that this was an attempt to convince policymakers that AIPAC &quot;is doing something wrong&quot;. In 2013 CNI paid for ten billboard advertisements in Atlanta, Georgia, and six more nationwide protesting United States government&#x27;s &quot;blank check&quot; funding for Israel.

===Fact finding tours===
For a number of years, CNI has been known in the Middle East for organizing regular &quot;political pilgrimages&quot; to promote dialogue among American citizens, including many former officials, and Arab leaders, many of whom are on the United States &quot;political terrorism&quot; list or the unofficial &quot;persona non grata&quot; list. These have included Hezbollah&#x27;s Naim Qassim, Nawaf Ammar and Ibrahim Mousawi and Lebanon&#x27;s Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, Michel Aoun, Walid Jumblatt and Sheik Abed al Karem Obeid. In Spring 2006, CNI members, including Edward Peck, conducted a fact-finding tour of the Middle East region, meeting with heads of state and acting as international observers in the Palestinian election process. Three were former U.S. diplomats who met in Lebanon with Hassan Nasrallah leader of Hezbollah.

In July 2007 CNI sponsored a meeting in Haret Hreik, Lebanon, between former U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Robert Dillon and leaders of Hezbollah. In preparation for the November 2007 Annapolis Conference to discuss a two-state solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, CNI funded a 2007 trip by six representatives, including Ambassador Robert V. Keeley and Daniel Lieberman. They met in face-to-face talks with prime ministers, foreign ministers and non-government officials of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

CNI sponsored a 2008 trip which included both &quot;citizen diplomats&quot; and retired diplomats like Richard Noyes Viets who met with, among others, representatives of Hamas. In 2009 CNI representatives, including former Ambassador to Russia Jack F. Matlock, Jr. met with Hamas leader Khaled Mashal. The tour of Gaza, Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon was led by Harriet Mayor Fulbright, wife of the late U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright. She later wrote Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking her to urge Israel to allow freer movement in and out of Gaza and to allow U.S. diplomats to meet with Hamas and Hezbollah officials.

In 2010, a delegation of politicians, academics and members of the Council for the National Interest met with Gaza Strip Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh. His spokesperson told reporters Haniyya wanted direct relations with the United States and the international community and said that &quot;Hamas is not against the efforts aiming to establish of a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 borderlines with Jerusalem as its capital&quot;. Then CNI vice-chair Ambassador David Newton said the group intended to &quot;convey the reality of the humanitarian situation to the US Congress.&quot;

==Controversy==
CNI has been called anti-Israel by author Mitchell Bard and Martin J. Raffel of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs.

Executive director of CNI, Philip Giraldi, is also the author of a regular column at &quot;The Unz Review&quot;, a far right online publication known to publish advocacy for Holocaust denial and justifications for anti-semitism.

In 2000, Pete McCloskey gave a speech at a conference of the Institute for Historical Review, a publisher of Holocaust denial material. When McCloskey ran in the 2006 Republican Party primary for Congress, which he would lose, there was a public controversy over exactly what he said about the Holocaust at the event.

Abdurahman Alamoudi, a member of the CNI board of directors, stated at a rally on October 28, 2000, against Israel in Lafayette Park, across from the White House: &quot;&#x27;Hear that, Bill Clinton! We are all supporters of Hamas. I wish they add that I am also a supporter of Hizballah.&quot; Both Hamas and Hizballah are designated as terrorist groups by the United States, Israel, Japan, Canada and others.

In 2004, Alamoudi pleaded guilty to financial and conspiracy charges related to terrorism and was subsequently sentenced to 23 years in prison. Eugene Bird explained that at the time he joined CNI Alamoudi was a highly regarded Muslim spokesperson who worked with the United States Department of State. As soon as Alamoudi was convicted, CNI asked him to leave its board.

On May 4, 2004, Eugene Bird was interviewed by Neil Macdonald on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (CBC) National News and commented, &quot;We know that the Israeli intelligence was operating in Baghdad after the war was over. The question should be, were there any foreign interrogators among those that were recommending very, very bad treatment for the prisoners?&quot; Honest Reporting Canada, a pro-Israel NGO objected to Eugene Bird&#x27;s comments and wrote complaints to the CBC. This resulted in CBC later stating &quot;there was no evidence Israel was involved in the Abu Ghraib affair&quot; and that CBC was negligent in not mentioning Bird&#x27;s connection to the Council for the National Interest.

The ADL voiced concern about a 2003 article written by board member Paul Findley, in which the ADL said Findley blamed America&#x27;s relationship with Israel for the September 11 attacks. The ADL quoted Findley as writing &quot;Nine-eleven would not have occurred if the U.S. government had refused to help Israel humiliate and destroy Palestinian society&quot;.

In 2006, the Jewish Community Center of Greater Washington cancelled a poetry reading by the Partners for Peace group because it rented office space from CNI. Center representative stated that because of Partners for Peace&#x27;s &quot;link to an anti-Zionist group, we decided it wasn&#x27;t in the best interests of the center and the community to co-sponsor the event.&quot; Faith United Methodist Church in Rockville sponsored the event instead.

<text>Herbert Zimmermann (29 November 1917 – 16 December 1966) was a popular German football commentator.

He did one of the most famous pieces of commentary in German during the World Cup final in 1954 by &quot;recommending&quot; the goal that won &quot;The Miracle of Bern&quot; for West Germany.

:&quot;Schäfer nach innen geflankt... Kopfball... Abgewehrt. Aus dem Hintergrund müßte Rahn schießen... Rahn schießt! Tor! Tor! Tor! Tor!&quot;(silence)&quot;Tor für Deutschland! Drei zu zwei führt Deutschland. Halten Sie mich für verrückt, halten Sie mich für übergeschnappt!&quot;

:&quot;Schäfer puts in the cross... header... Cleared. Rahn should shoot from deep... Rahn shoots! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal!&quot;(Zimmermann fell silent for eight seconds before he spoke again)&quot;Goal for Germany! Germany lead 3-2. Call me mad, call me crazy!&quot;&quot;

At the end of the match, Zimmermann famously proclaimed, &quot;It&#x27;s over! Over! Over! Germany are the World Champions&quot; - words which, as one historian has observed, are &quot;as famous in Germany as Kenneth Wolstenholme&#x27;s &quot;They think it&#x27;s all over&quot; is in England&quot; (the latter having been spoken in the final moments of England&#x27;s victory against West Germany in the World Cup final of 1966). After the final Zimermann was criticized for praising the goal keeper Turek by calling him &quot;Toni du bist ein Teufelskerl, Toni du bist ein Fußballgott&quot; (Toni you are a devil chap. Toni you are a football god.). Zimmermann who had been a major during the war, was also criticized for the somewhat militaristic vocabulary he had used during the match.
Zimmermann also commented the world championships in 1958, 1962 and 1966 over the radio. However, TV was more prominent now as most people had access to TV sets, so fewer and fewer people heard his reports.

On 11 December 1966 Zimmermann, who was known as a notoriously bad driver, had an accident in his car and died from his injuries five days later.

Zimmermann was the uncle of the German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele. The family holds the rights to his reports which still generates revenue.

<doc id="566767" wikidata="Q966331" url="?curid=566767" title="Time (Electric Light Orchestra album)">
<text>Time is the ninth studio album by English rock band Electric Light Orchestra (credited as ELO), released in July 1981 on Jet Records. It is a concept album about a man from the 1980s who is taken to the year 2095, where he is confronted by the dichotomy between technological advancement and a longing for past romance. The record topped the UK Albums Chart for two weeks, though it attracted mixed reviews for its heavy use of synthesizers and stylistic shift away from the orchestral rock of previous ELO albums. It has since gained a cult following, particularly among retrofuturist enthusiasts.

&quot;Time&quot; is a work of synth-pop that combines elements from 1950s music, new wave, reggae, rockabilly, the Beatles, Phil Spector and the Shadows. The album signalled a departure from the band&#x27;s sound by emphasising electronics over its usual orchestra. It is also the band&#x27;s second concept album, the first being &quot;Eldorado&quot; in 1974. The music video created for its lead single, &quot;Hold On Tight&quot;, was the most expensive ever made to that point, with a budget of approximately £40,000. Four more singles followed the album&#x27;s release: &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;Ticket to the Moon&quot; (backed with &quot;Here Is the News&quot;), &quot;Rain Is Falling&quot; and &quot;The Way Life&#x27;s Meant to Be&quot;.

The record is considered the first major concept album devoted to time travel as well as ELO&#x27;s most influential album. The &quot;Prologue&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot; tracks were used in the 1983 anime opening animation &quot;Daicon IV&quot;. In 2001, a CD reissue of &quot;Time&quot; included three additional tracks that were originally left off the LP.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Time&quot; followed the albums &quot;Discovery&quot;, on which ELO had dispensed with their three-man string section (although orchestration was used on the album), and &quot;Xanadu&quot;, the soundtrack to the 1980 musical film of the same name, which was met with a mixed reception. On &quot;Time&quot;, bandleader Jeff Lynne chose to emphasise electronics over the band&#x27;s orchestral sound. He wrote a collection of songs with a theme that focused on time travel and civilisation in the year 2095. The album&#x27;s musical style draws from the 1950s, new wave, reggae, rockabilly and the work of artists such as the Beatles, Phil Spector and the Shadows. Writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Kevin Mathews says that the album reflects Lynne&#x27;s absorption in the UK synth-pop sound popularised by contemporary artists such as Gary Numan, OMD and the Human League.

ELO recorded &quot;Time&quot; mainly at Musicland Studios in Munich, West Germany, with some sessions taking place at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Three additional songs written in the album&#x27;s context were recorded, but left off the release: &quot;The Bouncer&quot;, &quot;When Time Stood Still&quot; and &quot;Julie Don’t Live Here&quot;. These songs were originally going to be on a double album of &quot;Time&quot;, but they were instead issued as B-sides of later singles after &quot;Time&quot; was reduced to a single album.

==Concept and story line==
Lynne&#x27;s comments on the album&#x27;s concept are as follows: in 1981, a man drifts into a state of twilight (&quot;Twilight&quot;), where he appears to have entered the year 2095, meets a Gynoid (&quot;Yours Truly, 2095&quot;), and reflects on the 1980s, &quot;back when things were so uncomplicated&quot; (&quot;Ticket to the Moon&quot;). Walking down the same street from a hundred years before, he is dismayed by the plastic flowers and ivory towers which have grown on top of it (&quot;The Way Life&#x27;s Meant to Be&quot;). As he remains in this future period, he looks out his window depressed, watching the world go by (&quot;Rain Is Falling&quot;). He attempts to send a letter in the form of a dream to his girlfriend in the past, but fails (&quot;From the End of the World&quot;).

When asked whether the man&#x27;s experiences had been a dream all along, Lynne responded: &quot;This is what I&#x27;d like to know, because it&#x27;s baffled me since I wrote it, if he has actually gone [to the future], or if he&#x27;s just thinking about it. ... It could be real, or it could be a dream... I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;d rather not say, because I don&#x27;t know either. I&#x27;m supposed to, but I don&#x27;t.&quot; Mathews writes: &quot;Like &quot;Eldorado&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; contained a prologue and an epilogue ... Although there is hardly any plot to thread the various songs together, the theme remains largely intact ... they embellish, rather than engage.&quot; A recurring line that appears in the album&#x27;s epilogue is: &quot;though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow, you still wander the fields of your sorrow&quot;. &quot;Rockol&quot;&#x27;s writer says that the protagonist revisits the place he once lived only to find that it has become unrecognisable (&quot;The Way Life&#x27;s Meant to Be&quot;). Afterwards, he hopes that he may be able to return home with a time machine, &quot;but with all their great inventions and all their good intentions, here I stay&quot; (&quot;Rain Is Falling&quot;). Following his final attempt to return to the past, the protagonist is invited to &quot;hold on&quot; (&quot;Hold On Tight&quot;). 

Author Adam Roberts calls &quot;Time&quot; a &quot;future-set rock opera&quot;. According to music journalist Mark Beaumont, it is a concept album about a man who is abducted forward in time to the year 2095, while the web publication &quot;Rockol&quot; and &quot;Stereo Review&quot; magazine both recognise &quot;Time&quot; as being about a man who becomes trapped in the future. &quot;The News &amp; Advance&quot;″s Ben Cates says it &quot;tells the story of a man living in the year 2095 who glimpses enough of the future to know that he wants to get back to the 1980s&quot;. Beaumont, however, joked that the album&#x27;s &quot;lyrical vision of the year 2095 – moon tourism! Hovercars! Smartphone spouses! – is still giving Elon Musk bad ideas.&quot;

==Release and reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;Time&quot; reached number 1 in the UK Albums Chart, maintaining the position for two weeks. The change in the band&#x27;s sound, particularly the lack of orchestral strings, came as a considerable shock to some ELO fans. Noel Coppage of &quot;Stereo Review&quot; found the band &quot;has slimmed down some and grown out of its twin-electric-cello phase, but it can still give you a case of the grandiosities. You&#x27;ll find great sweeps of melody and plenty of high and low and loud and soft sounds for your expensive hi-fi equipment to chew on.&quot; Coppage remarked of the album&#x27;s concept: &quot;Ironically, all he [the narrator] does the whole time is whine about how he misses good old 1981 and the girl he left back there. You want to shake him by the shoulders and say, &#x27;Man, have you no sense of adventure?&#x27;&quot;

Deborah Frost of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the storytelling a &quot;superfluous ... thematic conceit&quot; and said that, with the reliance on synthesised sounds, &quot;If ELO&#x27;s not careful, they&#x27;re going to end up becoming the kind of cheese that squirts out of an aerosol can.&quot; She described the album as a cross between the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and the 1960s science fiction television show &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;yet as long as Jeff Lynne&#x27;s future-vision Beatlemania comes in near-perfect Top Forty spurts, why moan?&quot; Frank Conte of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; opined: &quot;&quot;Time&quot; doesn&#x27;t stick together well as a concept but as far as pop sensibilities are concerned, ELO has no worries. Its brand of rock doesn&#x27;t only sway. It soars.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
In his retrospective review for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Kevin Mathews says that, despite Lynne&#x27;s decision to embrace a new, synth-pop sound, &quot;In essence … &quot;Time&quot; remained a quintessential ELO album.&quot; Mathews adds: &quot;Once again, Lynne’s melodic craft, technical expertise, production skills and encyclopaedic pop authority made &quot;Time&quot; a treasure for all true connoisseurs of classic pop music. Surprisingly, this re-issue reveals an artist ahead of his time as &quot;Time&quot; stands head-and-shoulders above the hip electro-pop records of the day.&quot;

&quot;The Quietus&quot;″ Joseph Stannard said that &quot;Time&quot; is a &quot;very good album indeed&quot;, highlighting &quot;Twilight&quot; as &quot;the most exciting song ever recorded ... Pulsating, momentous, charged with purpose and overstuffed with hooks, counter-hooks, sub-hooks and semi-hooks, &#x27;Twilight&#x27; makes being abducted by time travellers sound like the most fun you can have.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Beaumont listed &quot;Twilight&quot; as the 10th best song of ELO&#x27;s career &quot;for its space-age cathedral sizzle, warp-speed pacing and the sort of brazen futuristic hooklines that proved they gave that &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; gig to the wrong band&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s James Chrispell assessed the album as less-than-great formulaic work by ELO, noting a resemblance to work by the Alan Parsons Project and Wings rather than Lynne&#x27;s &quot;fascination with &quot;Pepper&quot;-era Beatles&quot;.

&quot;The Independent&quot; ranked &quot;Time&quot; as 17th on their list of 20 most underrated albums, with Beaumont writing that &quot;its sonics would more quickly become a blueprint for Eighties synthpop and inspire the likes of Daft Punk, Grandaddy and Ladyhawke.&quot;

==Legacy==
According to Beaumont, &quot;Time&quot; is the most influential album of ELO&#x27;s catalogue. The book &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Almanac&quot; cites it as the first major concept album devoted entirely to time travel. Rockol states that while &quot;Time&quot; is not one of the most celebrated ELO albums, it has attracted a cult following from those interested in retrofuturism. Among the album&#x27;s &quot;unexpected&quot; fans are the Flaming Lips and Daft Punk.

In an early 1980s &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine interview, Steve Winwood said that ELO&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; had influenced him. Ladyhawke has stated that ELO&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; is one of her five favourite albums.

In 1983, the tracks &quot;Prologue&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot; were used as the soundtrack for the &quot;Daicon IV&quot; opening animation, an animated music video created for the 1983 Nihon SF Taikai convention. According to academic Mark W. MacWilliams, the convention would go down as &quot;one of the most famous otaku events of all time&quot;. &quot;Hold On Tight&quot; was also used in a post-feature short that showcased the production work of &quot;Daicon IV&quot;. The song was later featured in &quot;Join the Coffee Achievers&quot;, a 2008 Honda Accord car ad campaign, and included in the 2011 Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts film &quot;Larry Crowne&quot;.

The 2010 Apples In Stereo album &quot;Travellers In Space and Time&quot; was heavily influenced by &quot;Time&quot;.

<text>Preben Hertoft (5 January 1928 – 26 February 2017), was a Danish psychiatrist and professor in medical sexology, senior doctorate in medicine.

After the death of his mentor Kirsten Auken, Hertoft worked over 40 years as a sexologist doing research, treatment, counseling and education. In 1986 he founded the first medical centre for sexology in Denmark. Most of the time he had heterosexual and homosexual patients with sexual problems in therapy, but he also treated and counselled transvestites and pedophiles.

He was elected a fellow by the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex for outstanding contributions to the field.

<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) inherited several styles of coaching stock from its constituents. Stock built by the LMS itself can be categorised into three separate periods, numbered I to III.

==Coaches inherited from pre-grouping companies==
Various types of coaches were inherited from pre-grouping companies.

===Ex-Glasgow and South Western Railway===

A 1914 seven-compartment side-corridor third built by Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon for the Glasgow and South Western Railway is preserved by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society at Falkirk.

===Ex-Highland Railway===

From 1897 bogie stock was generally introduced for main line services on the Highland Railway. However, six-wheelers appeared as late as 1908. An example of a six-wheel composite coupé, No. 89, latterly in service stock, is preserved by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society at Falkirk.

===Ex-Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway===

Many hundreds of carriages built for the L&amp;Y (mainly at Newton Heath works) came into LMS stock, including some 6-wheel saloons. Newton Heath also built LMS designs for a few years in the 1920s. Currently two ex-L&amp;Y carriages taken into LMS service have been preserved and restored for irregular public use on the Worth Valley Railway, although one is mounted on a BR underframe built at Wolverton in 1956. These are owned by the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway Trust.

==Coaches built by the LMS==

The design and building of LMS coaches followed a very standardised pattern. Very many types of coaches were built to suit the various services and needs but, in general, the progression of design features was a logical one. Three quite distinct periods of design can be recognised, the last of which continued until after nationalisation of the railways in Britain.

===Period I (1923–1928/9)===
The general styling of LMS Period I coaches followed much the same ideas as were prevalent elsewhere in Britain. They were wooden framed and panelled, had a fully beaded body with a semi-elliptical roof, doors to all compartments of side-corridor coaches, and were mounted on a steel underframe derived from the final Midland Railway design. Window ventilation was mainly by droplight. Roof ventilators were generally of the torpedo type. The coaches were fitted with non-automatic screw couplers and gangwayed stock made use of scissors-type British Standard pattern corridor connection (as also used on the Great Western Railway).

Most coaches ran on two four-wheel bogies which were of a 9 ft 0 in wheelbase single bolster design which hardly changed for the whole of the company&#x27;s life. Some special vehicles ran on twelve wheel chassis and the six-wheel bogie on these vehicles was of 12 ft 6 in wheel-base, based on the London and North Western Railway design. All coaches except kitchen cars were electrically lit and normally fitted with vacuum brake as standard.

Certain characteristic Midland Railway features were incorporated in the design of early LMS coaches which distinguished them from those of other lines. Most noticeable of these was the twin-window arrangement in each seating bay of the vestibule coaches. This took the form of two rectangular windows side by side (one fixed and one drop-light), rather than a single window or centre drop-light with two flanking quarterlight arrangement. There was generally a Stones pattern ventilator in the eaves panel above the fixed light of these window pairs.

During this period, the LMS company introduced a considerable quantity of conventional coaches which were comfortable and well built but whose designs were not particularly revolutionary. Externally, these early LMS coaches were extremely attractive in the fully panelled and beaded style and with the fully lined Crimson Lake livery.

The first indication of changing ideas were some very handsome corridor vehicles in 1927. For the first time, the LMS abandoned outside compartment doors in corridor coaches and introduced larger windows in their stead. At first there were two such windows in each compartment (one fixed and one frameless droplight) in the manner of the characteristic Midland pattern vestibule coaches already considered. They differed from the normal twin-window style in having frameless droplights and Stones ventilators over both windows and the style soon became adopted for other vehicles. By 1930 it had made its appearance in some composites, this time with but one Stones ventilator centrally over the window pair and with large 4 ft 6 in wide corridor side windows.

The next development in the somewhat tentative progression towards more up to date amenity was the development of a single window per bay design which was introduced in 1928 with the building of ten very palatial carriages for inclusion in the &quot;Royal Scot&quot; and other prestige trains. Five of these coaches were semi-open firsts that had three compartments all finished in a different style with only four seats in each; each passenger thus had a corner seat. The open end was rather more conventional, seating 18 in two-and-one arrangement. These coaches were classed as dining vehicles and generally ran next to a kitchen car. The other five coaches were equally luxurious lounge brakes with accommodation for 10 first class passengers in eight individual armchairs and a settee. They again had large single windows instead of the two-window arrangement.

These 10 vehicles were followed in 1929 by a similarly styled batch of 25 neutral vestibule coaches for either first or third class passengers. These were 42 seaters with seven bays arranged two and one and again designated as dining vehicles. With these, the single window style could finally be said to have &#x27;arrived&#x27; in LMS gangwayed coaches.

Although these 1928–29 coaches had single windows, they were still of the high-waisted design with full exterior beading - as indeed were most LMS coaches to this time - and there is some evidence that although the single window was more appreciated than the earlier arrangement, it was not always easy to see out of it because of the high waist. This was, apparently, particularly irksome in the lounge brakes which with their very low seated chairs were, seemingly, never very popular. Thus it was that the single window design was not perpetuated in the high waisted style.

Some all-steel coaches were introduced in 1925–26. These were open thirds and brake thirds, together with a large number of full brakes, which were built by outside contractors, probably to assist the steel industry at that time. Construction apart, however, their two-window style and interior layout showed no advance on the other coaches of the time while externally they were finished in a pseudo fully beaded style.

===Period II (1929–1932)===
The start of the second phase in LMS carriage design was almost contemporary with the introduction of the previously mentioned high-waisted, single window designs and the new trend of thought was first exemplified by the appearance in 1929 of six luxury brake firsts with two-a-side compartment seating and somewhat palatial toilet accommodation.

These new carriages all had single windows but the waist of the coach was much lower than hitherto. The principal external difference was the elimination of the waist panel as result of deepening of windows. The new coaches were, however, still wood panelled and fully beaded and with the full lining represented very handsome designs. As with their Period I predecessors, these coaches went to the more important trains such as the &quot;Royal Scot&quot;.

This low waisted trend in design only partially set the pattern for new construction because corridor composites continued to come out in the fully beaded two-window style and the corridor thirds and brake thirds continued to have full compartment doors until 1930. Thus there was a certain amount of overlapping styles during the first part of the second period of LMS coach building.

It was again the vestibule coach which received the bulk of attention during this second phase. The first were a series of spacious long 42 seaters. Some of these, which were classified as dining vehicles were built as firsts but were downgraded a few years later on the advent of the Stanier firsts. They were followed by a 56 seater for general service. More 42 seat coaches followed which, although identical to the original 42 seaters, were not classed as diners. All these coaches had the new low waist and were wood panelled with full outside beading. However, a much larger group of low-waisted vestibule coaches was the , 56 seat version of which 300 were built in 1931-2 and differed from the version in that they were steel clad with simulated external beading in paint. They did, however, follow the Period II style in all other respects and retained the raised window edge mouldings.

Eventually in 1930–31, the new low waisted style was adopted for all corridor stock too. Although mainly confined to composites and brake composites, it was a batch of corridor thirds in 1930 that really set new standards. These coaches were but 10 in number but had only seven compartments on a underframe. Although the traditional four on each side seating was retained, the compartments were no less than 6 ft 6 in between partitions. They were again wood panelled and fully beaded and were, reputedly, extremely comfortable. However, no more were built possibly because they were a little extravagant of space and large numbers of the earlier designs had been built between 1924 and 1928. They were to be the only corridor thirds to be built to this length.

On the specialised coaching side, this second phase of design was represented mainly by dining cars of which 36 were built which made amends for the relative lack of new dining cars during the first six years of the LMS. Like the 57 ft vestibule thirds mentioned earlier, these diners were steel panelled with painted simulated beading.

There were also two batches of 12-wheel composite sleeping cars built at this time that retained a high waist and certain LNWR styling features but were flush clad with frameless droplights. They were distinctly outside the main trend of LMS coach design.

Period 2 non-corridor stock differed little from the Period 1 examples.

===Period III (1933 onwards)===
In 1932, William Stanier took up his appointment as Chief Mechanical Engineer to the LMS and the first of the completely flush sided LMS coaches emerged soon enough after his assumption of office to lead to the coaches ever afterwards being referred to as &quot;Stanier&quot; stock.

The LMS flush sided coach, of which many examples still remained as late as 1967–8, differed in appearance from its predecessors mainly in the shape of its windows which now exhibited well-rounded corners. All the earlier coaches had, of course, been built with slightly rounded window corner mouldings but by comparison with Stanier vehicles, the Period I and II coach window was almost square cornered. The second major visible difference was also in the window area. During Period I, the favoured method of admitting fresh air was the droplight which was frequently supplemented by and finally (in Period II) in large measure superseded by the Stones and Dewel pattern glass vane ventilator.

With the Stanier stock was introduced the now familiar sliding ventilator incorporated in the upper part of the window. Initially this was quite shallow with only one section moveable but in 1934 this was replaced by a deeper ventilator with two wide sliding sections which remained almost until the end. From about 1947–8, the sliding portions were somewhat shortened and in this form were retained as a feature of the British Railways (BR) standard coach.

During the Stanier period, non-corridor coaches varied little from the pattern laid down in the 1920s except for the flush clad exterior. The design was still high waisted and the seating arrangements never changed from the earlier years. No inter district lavatory sets were built during the Stanier regime and apart from a few lavatory composites for the London Tilbury and Southend section, all the Stanier non-corridor stock was of the suburban type. There was an interesting batch of articulated triplets made in 1938 but these do not seem to have been very popular.

==Post Nationalisation==
LMS design coaches continued to be built for several years after 1947 until the introduction of the British Railways Mark 1. This short-lived period was, in fact, little more than a continuation of the Stanier era and was not really a new phase in the same sense that the flush sided stock itself was. Later corridor coaches have, however, been distinguished by the name &quot;Porthole&quot; stock by virtue of the circular toilet window feature which they introduced. This stock actually commenced building a year or two after 1947 and was, therefore, not strictly LMS stock as such but it was in the direct tradition of LMS coach building practice and has, therefore, been included here. It differed from the last versions of the Stanier stock proper (which themselves were built well into BR days) principally in the circular toilet windows which replaced the earlier rectangular ones, but also in having post-war torpedo ventilators and the final style of sliding window ventilators.

==Preservation==
* The Severn Valley Railway has a complete rake of Period III coaches. RFO No. 7511 has also been restored for use on the railway&#x27;s dining trains.
* The LMS Carriage Association (link) also owns several coaches, most of which are based at Peak Rail, although two (27162 and 27001), are based at the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway.
* Whole sets of Period I, II and III in varying states have been preserved across the U.K. The Midland Railway Butterley has possibly the most varied and unique collection, but others include the Bo&#x27;ness and Kinneil Railway, which has three Period III coaches on display, and the Strathspey Railway, which has two Period III coaches, although these are currently not in use.
* Two suburban coaches survive on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, both currently out of use and not on public display. One is a 9-compartment third built in 1938 and purchased directly from BR passenger service in the 1960s, the other a composite built to LMS design in 1951 and used as a departmental mess van by BR.

<text>Secret Messages is the tenth studio album by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), released in 1983 on Jet Records. It was the last ELO album with bass guitarist Kelly Groucutt, conductor Louis Clark and a full orchestra, and the last ELO album to be released on the Jet label. It was also the final ELO studio album to become a worldwide top 40 hit upon release.

==Original concept==
&quot;Secret Messages&quot;, as its title suggests, is littered with hidden messages in the form of backmasking, some obvious and others less so. This was Jeff Lynne&#x27;s second tongue-in-cheek response to allegations of hidden Satanic messages in earlier Electric Light Orchestra LPs by Christian fundamentalists, which led to American congressional hearings in the early 1980s (a similar response had been made by Lynne on the &quot;Face the Music&quot; album, during the intro to the &quot;Fire on High&quot; track).

Louis Clark returned to conduct the strings once more and the violinist Mik Kaminski appeared on an ELO recording for the first time since &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; in 1977, playing a violin solo on the track &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Is King&quot;. On completion of this album, Lynne dismissed bass guitarist Groucutt after Groucutt sued for alleged lost royalties and later received a settlement out of court.

==Artwork==
The cover was designed by David Costa created by the photographer Hag and hand-tinted by Kim Harris. It was the original from which Hag created &quot;The Future&#x27;s a Bit Fishy. We&#x27;ve Got a Hand in It.&quot; The cover&#x27;s foreground contains figures from various classical paintings. In the building on the right of the cover, the band is featured in the first-floor windows.

In Britain, the back cover of &quot;Secret Messages&quot; has the mock notice &quot;Warning: Contains Secret Backward Messages&quot;. Word of the album&#x27;s impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to cause CBS Records to delete the cover blurb there.

The back cover of the record jacket (made to look like the back of a picture frame) also contains &quot;Secret Messages&quot; in the form of three aged and weathered stickers. One is the track listing and the other two contain mock names of the retailer and manufacturer of the frame. These names are anagrams of the four band members: T.D. Ryan (R. Tandy), F.Y.J. Fennel (Jeff Lynne), G.U. Ruttock (K. Groucutt) and E.V. Nabbe (Bev Bevan). The inner record sleeve also contains a &quot;Secret Message&quot;. The front and back has a string of dots and dashes that is actually Morse code and repeats &quot;E L O&quot;: E (one dot), L (dot dash dot dot) and O (dash dash dash).

==Release==
The record was originally going to be a double album, but this plan was thwarted by Jet&#x27;s distributor, CBS Records, who claimed that producing a double vinyl album would be too expensive; as a result, leader Jeff Lynne would have to reduce it to a single album.

Three singles were released from the album in the UK: &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Is King&quot;, the title track and &quot;Four Little Diamonds&quot;. In the US, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Is King&quot;, &quot;Four Little Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Stranger&quot; were issued. &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Is King&quot; became the band&#x27;s last UK Top 20 hit. The song &quot;Letter from Spain&quot; was used as backing music in commercials for the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in 1992 in Barcelona.

The songs &quot;After All&quot; and &quot;Buildings Have Eyes&quot; from the original intended double album were released as B-sides to &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Is King&quot; and &quot;Secret Messages&quot; respectively. The song &quot;Endless Lies&quot; was later re-recorded with a different pre-chorus for the band’s subsequently released &quot;Balance of Power&quot; album. Three additional songs, &quot;Hello My Old Friend&quot;, a string-laden eight-minute long tribute to the band&#x27;s home town Birmingham, &quot;Mandalay&quot; and &quot;No Way Out&quot; (along with aforementioned &quot;Buildings Have Eyes&quot;) appeared on the &quot;Afterglow&quot; box set released in 1990.

In 2001, &quot;Secret Messages&quot; was remastered and reissued on CD with bonus tracks including the previously unreleased original 1983 version of &quot;Endless Lies&quot;.

A 35th anniversary edition was released by Legacy Recordings on double LP and via streaming services on 3 August 2018. It closely matched the format and length originally conceived by Jeff Lynne for the 1983 release, though one track remains unreleased (&quot;Beatles Forever&quot;). Other alterations from the original 1983 release include the album&#x27;s outro being moved from the end of &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Is King&quot; to &quot;Hello My Old Friend&quot; and an edit of &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Is King&quot; B-side &quot;After All&quot;.

<doc id="566778" wikidata="Q1930415" url="?curid=566778" title="Zoom (Electric Light Orchestra album)">
<text>Zoom is the twelfth studio album by British symphonic rock band Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), released on 12 June 2001 on Epic Records. It was the first official ELO album since 1986&#x27;s &quot;Balance of Power.&quot;

==Recording==
&quot;Zoom&quot; was recorded primarily by Jeff Lynne alone, with guest musicians including George Harrison and Ringo Starr. &quot;Zoom&quot; is the first ELO album not to feature original drummer Bev Bevan and was one of Harrison&#x27;s last recordings before his death. The only other ELO member appearing on the album, Richard Tandy, appears on the opening track and performed live in promotional concerts.

==Release and reception==
The album was the band&#x27;s first release of new material since &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, released in 1986. Although billed as a return to the classic ELO sound, the album sales were relatively poor and a planned North American concert tour was cancelled. Upon release, the album charted at number 34 in the UK Albums Chart. In the US, it debuted at number 94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 14 on the Billboard Top Internet Albums chart, with around 18,000 copies sold in the United States. As of October 2015, the album had sold 87,000 copies in the US.

The album peaked at number 51 on Austria&#x27;s &quot;Ö3 Austria Top 40 Longplay&quot; chart, and number 16 on Germany&#x27;s Media Control Album Chart. The single from the album &quot;Alright&quot; peaked at number 87 on the Dutch Top 40 chart in the Netherlands.

A remaster by Frontiers was released on 19 April 2013 in the UK, and on 23 April 2013 in the US, and included four previously unreleased bonus tracks, two of them live recordings from the 2001 Zoom Tour Live PBS taping at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The remaster of the Japan-only track, &quot;Long Black Road&quot; (which doesn&#x27;t appear on the Frontiers release), was included along with &quot;10538 Overture&quot; in the soundtrack for the 2013 film &quot;American Hustle&quot;.

<doc id="566781" wikidata="Q7809781" url="?curid=566781" title="Solar Eclipse (video game)">
<text>Solar Eclipse is a 1995 space flight simulation video game developed and published by Crystal Dynamics, released initially for the Sega Saturn in North America, Europe and Japan.

&quot;Solar Eclipse&quot; was developed under the title &quot;Titan&quot;, but the American marketing team decided it would sell better if published as a sequel to the 1994 video game &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, especially as the two featured similar gameplay and graphical style. In Japan and Europe, it was released as Titan Wars.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Solar Eclipse&quot; is a hybrid of rail shooter and space combat simulation; the general direction of the ship&#x27;s flight is locked in, but the player may maneuver a substantial area, and can at certain points choose from multiple routes.

==Development==
The game was developed in 16 months.

==Reception==
The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Saturn version a 7.75 out of 10 average. They praised the intense gameplay, the considerable strategy required to elude enemy fire, and the solid graphics. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Captain Squideo had a more mixed reaction, criticizing the partially on-rails flight and saying the landscapes and enemies become repetitious. He concluded that the game is nonetheless fun to play and &quot;eclipses most other shooters&quot;, but that these problems would discourage repeat plays.

<doc id="566783" wikidata="Q5419833" url="?curid=566783" title="Executive Council of the Irish Free State">
<text>The Executive Council () was the cabinet and executive branch of government of the 1922–1937 Irish Free State. Formally, executive power was vested in the Governor-General on behalf of the King. In practice, however, it was the Council that governed, since the Governor-General was (with few exceptions) bound to act on its advice. The Executive Council included a prime minister called the President of the Executive Council and a deputy prime minister called the vice-president. A member of the council was called an executive minister, as distinct from an extern minister who had charge of a department without being in the council.

The President of the Executive Council was appointed by the Governor-General after being nominated by Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (parliament), and the remaining Executive Ministers were nominated by the President. The Executive Council could also be removed by a vote of no confidence in the Dáil.

For formal and diplomatic purposes, the description &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State&quot; was sometimes used.

==Overview==
The Free State constitution provided that executive authority would be vested in the King and exercised by his Governor-General, who would appoint an Executive Council to &quot;aid and advise&quot; him. However, under Article 51 this power was only exercisable &quot;in accordance with the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the exercise of the Executive Authority in the case of the Dominion of Canada&quot;. In practice this meant that, as in Canada, the Governor-General was in most cases required to act on the advice of the Executive Council. Thus, it was the cabinet in which true authority lay.

In addition to exercising the executive authority, the Executive Council, by advising the Governor-General, had the exclusive right to:

*Convene and dissolve parliament – although this right could not be exercised by a cabinet which had lost the confidence of the Dáil.
*Command of the Defence Forces – although the cabinet could not involve the state in a war without the consent of the Oireachtas.
*Appoint judges.
*Introduce a money bill in the Oireachtas.

Once the President of the Executive Council had been appointed he nominated the vice-president himself. The remaining cabinet ministers were also nominated by the President but had to be approved by a vote of consent in the Dáil. Initially the constitution provided that the Executive Council would consist of between five and seven ministers (not including its president) but under a constitutional amendment adopted in 1927 this maximum limit was increased to twelve. Similarly, initially it was required that all cabinet members hold seats in the Dáil, but an amendment in 1929 provided that one member could be a senator.

If the Executive Council ceased to &quot;retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann&quot; the entire cabinet was obliged to resign , however they were permitted to remain in office as acting ministers until the appointment of successors. The fact that an Executive Council that had lost the confidence of the Dáil could not request a dissolution created the possibility of a political stalemate. It meant that if the Executive Council resigned after being defeated, and the Dáil could not agree on a new Council, a Catch-22 situation might be created, in which the inability of the Dáil to choose a cabinet could not be resolved by the holding of a general election. Unlike the equivalent position since 1937 of Taoiseach, the President of the Executive Council did not have authority to advise the Governor-General to dismiss ministers. Rather, to dismiss a single member, the whole council had to be dismissed and reformed . Additionally, the President of the council could not ask the Governor-General to dissolve the Dáil on his own initiative, but the council as a whole had to do so. This meant that the position of the President was weaker than that of most modern prime ministers, and he was the council&#x27;s chairman as much as he was its leader.

==History==
The Executive Council was established with the coming into force of the Free State constitution in 1922. It replaced two previous cabinets: the Ministry of Dáil Éireann of the Irish Republic established under the Dáil Constitution and the Provisional Government established under the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The Irish Free State had the status of a dominion of the British Commonwealth and the Irish Executive Council derived its name from organs of government found in other dominions. However it differed from the &#x27;executive councils&#x27; of other nations. Firstly, it was a cabinet, whereas the Executive Councils of Australia and New Zealand each serve a role closer to that of a privy council. Secondly, whereas in the Free State the President of the Executive Council was the head of government, in Australia it is the Governor-General who is formally its president, although he need not attend all of its meetings. Contrary to the practice in New Zealand and Australia, the executive councils of the provinces of Canada are closer in role to the Free State cabinet, and are presided over by each province&#x27;s premier.

The office of Governor-General was abolished by the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936. From 11 December 1936 to 29 December 1937, the remaining months of the Irish Free State, the executive authority and a number of the Governor-General&#x27;s other functions were exercised by the Executive Council directly, but in practice this change was merely symbolic. The Executive Council itself was replaced in 1937 by a new cabinet, called simply the Government, established under the new Constitution of Ireland.

==List of Executive Councils==

==&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State&quot;==

The Irish Free State was a constitutional monarchy, initially one of the dominions within the British Empire (later the Commonwealth of Nations), whose monarch had the same title in all parts of the Empire and its territories, and the Free State government was sometimes officially referred to as &#x27;His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State&#x27;.

After the 1926 Imperial Conference, attended by Cosgrave as President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, the King&#x27;s title was changed under the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927. The altered title, as proclaimed in London, replaced the words &quot;...of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and...&quot; with &quot;...of Great Britain, Ireland and...&quot;. This change did not stop the Irish government using the description &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State&quot; in agreements between the monarch&#x27;s governments in the United Kingdom and in the Irish Free State, as in: 
*Agreement between His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State as to the Registration and Control of Veterinary Surgeons (1931). 
*Agreement interpreting and supplementing Article ten of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland to which the force of law was given by the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922 and by the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act, 1922 (1929).

The description was also in regular official use between 1929 and 1934 in Notes published by HMSO, &quot;in Regard to Commercial Relations&quot; formally exchanged &quot;Between His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State&quot; and foreign governments including the governments of:
*Brazil, 1931 
*Costa Rica, 1934 
*Guatemala, 1930 
*Roumania, 1930 
*Salvador, 1931,
and in other such Notes, including:
*Exchange of Notes Between His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State and the Italian Government Concerning Reciprocal Recognition of Passenger Ships&#x27; Certificates and Emigrant Ship Regulations, 1930 
*Exchange of Notes Between His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State and the Egyptian Government Prolonging the Commercial &quot;Modus Vivendi&quot; of 25/28 July 1930.

In a debate in the Dáil in December 1932, when de Valera was president, on a government motion to approve a trade agreement negotiated at the Ottawa Conference in August between the Irish Free State and the Dominion of Canada, it was remarked that the vice-president (Ernest Blythe) had signed the agreement &quot;on behalf of His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State.&quot; But the description went out of use at least by 1937, when the Constitution of Ireland came into effect as a result of de Valera&#x27;s process of constitutional autochthony. Any remaining vestige of the monarch&#x27;s part in the constitution, or doubt about the person or office of the head of state, was removed when the state was finally declared to be a republic, as from 18 April 1949, under the Republic of Ireland Act 1948.

<text>Betty Spaghetty was a bendable rubber doll from the Ohio Art Company. She is portrayed as a fun-loving teenager or preteen. She has two best friends named Zoe and Hannah and a younger sister. Her features include rubbery hair used to let children make different hairstyles and changeable hands, feet, shoes, etc. The doll was targeted at girls ages 4 and up. Some models came with accessories, such as a cell phone, a laptop computer, and in-line skates.

==History==
Betty Spaghetty was invented and designed by Elonne Dantzer and licensed to The Ohio Art Co. and released in 1998. The doll was very popular during its launch, however the line was discontinued in 2004 due to Ohio Art&#x27;s toy shipments falling to 15% due to weak retail markets and strong competition in the fashion doll market. But in 2007, Ohio Art announced that the dolls would return with a new look. The new Betty Spaghetty dolls were released later that year, but were discontinued a second time a year later due to lackluster sales. Moose Toys revealed at the 2016 Toy Fair that Betty Spaghetty would be sold as part of their brand in the fall of 2016.

Betty Spaghetty may have been the influence for the antagonist of the horror video game Poppy Playtime: Chapter 2, Mommy Long Legs. Like Betty Spaghetty, Mommy Long Legs has extendable and bendable arms, as well as a similar hairstyle.

Betty Spaghetty may also have been the influence for the doll-like, teenage inhabitants of Mount Rageous from &quot;Trolls Band Together&quot;, including the film&#x27;s antagonists Velvet (Amy Schumer) &amp; Veneer (Andrew Rannells).

<doc id="566796" wikidata="Q83329" url="?curid=566796" title="Nílton Santos">
<text>Nílton dos Santos (; 16 May 1925 – 27 November 2013) was a Brazilian footballer who primarily played as a wingback. At international level, he was a member of the Brazil squads that won the 1958 and 1962 World Cups.

Regarded as one of the greatest defenders in the history of the game, Nílton Santos is a member of the World Team of the 20th Century, and was named by Pelé one of the top 125 greatest living footballers at a FIFA Awards ceremony in 2004. In 2009, he was the recipient of the Golden Foot Legends Award. He was unrelated to his frequent defensive partner Djalma Santos.

==Club career==
Born in Rio de Janeiro, he was a pioneering attacking left back, being one of the first full backs to make runs down the wing to participate in the offensive game. Once he said: &quot;I have never envied today&#x27;s players the money but the freedom they have, to go forward&quot;.
He played all his professional club career for Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas.

He was called &quot;The Encyclopedia&quot; because of his knowledge of the sport of football. He was world class both at defending and attacking and possessed very good technique.

==International career==
Nílton was a key player in defence during the 1954, 1958 and 1962 World Cup finals (he was also in the Brazilian squad for the 1950 finals, but made no appearances) and became famous for scoring a goal in the 1958 tournament when Brazil played Austria. Dribbling his way through the whole field, he finished with a shot that drove his coach Vicente Feola crazy (he kept on insisting for Nílton to retreat to the defensive field, but was ignored until the goal was scored).

Nílton Santos played for only two teams in his professional career; Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas and the Brazil national team collecting 75 caps and scoring 3 goals.

==Death==
Santos died of a lung infection on 27 November 2013, aged 88, in Rio de Janeiro. He was not only the last surviving member of the Brazil 1950 FIFA World Cup squad, but also the fourth 1958 World Cup champion to die in a few months, after Djalma Santos died in July 2013, Gilmar and De Sordi both in August 2013 and all of them within a year of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in their native Brazil.

==Legacy==
Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas&#x27;s home, and 2016 Summer Olympics host stadium, the Estádio Olímpico Nílton Santos, also called &quot;Engenhão&quot;, is named after him.

<doc id="566799" wikidata="Q7307404" url="?curid=566799" title="Reform Party (Gibraltar)">
<text>The Gibraltar Reform Party was a political party in Gibraltar. It was a left-leaning party which described itself as green and for social justice.

Originally formed as the Independent Liberal Forum on 21 March 2000, the name was subsequently changed to the later one. The last party leader was Lyana Armstrong-Emery.

The party&#x27;s broad aim was a decentralisation of power. On the constitutional status of Gibraltar, the party supported a new status, calling for Gibraltar&#x27;s establishment as a devolved autonomous territory, integrated within a decentralised federal Britain. The party also called for the creation of a local Parliament for Gibraltar, a member of parliament (MP) to sit in the British House of Commons in Westminster, and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) to represent Gibraltar in the European Parliament.

The Reform Party forged links with both the Green Party of England and Wales and Mebyon Kernow. Lyana Armstrong-Emery was voted by the party to take the position on the joint list agreed with the Green Party for the European Elections.

The party ceased operations in 2005 owing to a failure to garner wide public support.

==Election results==
===Parliament of Gibraltar===
===European Parliament===
Gibraltar is part of the South West England constituency in the European parliament and its major parties form joint ticket alliances with the major UK parties. In 2004, the only EU election that it participated in before its dissolution, Reform had been in an alliance with the Green Party.

<text>Daniel Jackson, PhD, is a fictional character in the military science fiction franchise &quot;Stargate&quot;, and one of the main characters of the 1997 series &quot;Stargate SG-1.&quot; He is portrayed by James Spader in the 1994 film &quot;Stargate&quot;, and by Michael Shanks in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and other &quot;SG-1&quot; derived media. Jackson is the only &quot;Stargate&quot; character to appear in all films and series in the franchise (excluding the non-canonical &quot;Stargate Infinity&quot;).

In the 1994 film, Dr. Jackson is an archaeologist who is a part of the first team to go through the Stargate on a reconnaissance mission, led by Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neil. He then becomes one of the main characters of the subsequent television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, where he, Jack O&#x27;Neill, Samantha Carter and Teal&#x27;c make up SG-1, a part of the Stargate Program whose goal is to explore the galaxy and defend against alien threats. Jackson is part of SG-1 until his death at the end of the season 5, when he is replaced by Jonas Quinn.

Upon his death, Dr. Jackson ascends to a higher plane of existence among the Ancients. He makes occasional appearances in season 6 before retaking human form and rejoining SG-1 in the seventh season. Jackson appears in the series until the finale at the end of the tenth season, and appears in both direct-to-DVD films that act as sequels to the series.

He also appears in three episodes of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and four episodes of &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. For his portrayal of Jackson, Shanks was nominated for three Saturn Awards for Best Actor on Television, and for five Leo Awards, winning two: Best Lead Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series for &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in 2004, and Best Lead Performance by a Male in a Feature Length Drama for &quot;&quot; in 2009.

==Character arc==
Born on July 8, 1965, Daniel Jackson is the only living child of Melburn and Claire Jackson, archaeologists who were crushed to death while supervising the placement of a piece of Egyptian art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Daniel&#x27;s maternal grandfather and only living relative, Nick Ballard (played by Jan Rubeš), was a noted Dutch archaeologist and too busy to take the orphaned Jackson under his wing. Though placed in foster care, Daniel visited his grandfather in a mental institution until they had an argument over his failing career and Daniel left. Daniel became an archaeologist and linguist who speaks 23 earthly (plus several extraterrestrial) languages—he is shown speaking at least English, Russian, German, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Egyptian, Goa&#x27;uld, Ancient, and Unas.
In the 1994 film &quot;Stargate&quot;, the character of Daniel is introduced in a scene in which he is presenting a lecture at an academic seminar. However, he finds little acceptance there of his theory that the Pyramids of Giza are much older than they are thought to be. An aged woman named Catherine Langford approaches him to offer him a job deciphering the cover-stones of a device found in Egypt. Jackson uses his knowledge of ancient Egyptian languages to make the device, named the Stargate, function.

Jackson then travels with a team, led by Jack O&#x27;Neill, through the Stargate, and they discover that it leads to the planet Abydos. Daniel meets, falls in love with, and marries a native woman, Sha&#x27;uri (named Sha&#x27;re in the TV series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;). After winning the battle to free the Abydonians from the System Lord Ra, Daniel decides not to return to Earth with the rest of the team and to instead live the rest of his life learning about the culture and history of Abydos, with its culture based on that of ancient Egypt. Jack O&#x27;Neill lies to his superiors, saying that Daniel Jackson is dead.

In the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, Daniel&#x27;s life changes when his wife and his brother-in-law are abducted and turned into hosts for the Goa&#x27;uld. Daniel joins the SG-1 team in hopes of rescuing them. Daniel is briefly reunited with Sha&#x27;re, who had been made host to Apophis&#x27; queen Amonet, in season 2&#x27;s &quot;Secrets&quot;, when she temporarily controls her body while pregnant with the Harcesis child Shifu. Shortly after Teal&#x27;c kills Sha&#x27;re in season 3&#x27;s &quot;Forever in a Day&quot;, Sha&#x27;re gives Daniel information to find her child, reconfirms her love for him and asks him to forgive Teal&#x27;c. Daniel remains a part of the team and later saves his brother-in-law Skaara from the Goa&#x27;uld Klorel in season 3&#x27;s &quot;Pretense&quot;. In season 3&#x27;s &quot;Maternal Instinct&quot;, Daniel discovers the Harcesis child on another planet and leaves him under the care of Oma Desala, a being of great power and wisdom. SG-1 meets Shifu again as a much older boy in season 4&#x27;s &quot;Absolute Power&quot;.

In the penultimate season 5 episode &quot;Meridian&quot;, Daniel is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation while attempting to fix a naquadria reactor on the planet Langara in the Nation State known as Kelowna. The Ancient, Oma Desala, guides Daniel to ascend to a higher plane of existence. The Kelownan scientist Jonas Quinn takes Daniel&#x27;s place on SG-1 during season 6, although the rest of the team find it hard to get over Daniel&#x27;s absence. Ascended Daniel visits O&#x27;Neill and Teal&#x27;c during times of crisis, but the laws of ascended beings forbid him to directly interfere, with his visits simply consisting of providing moral support to his old teammates as they face torturous experiences on their own. In the season 6 finale &quot;Full Circle&quot;, ascended Daniel seeks to aid SG-1 in defeating the plans of Anubis. Before Daniel can destroy Anubis, he is whisked away, but Oma helps Daniel by ascending the entire population of Abydos before Anubis destroys the planet.

Daniel is discovered naked and without memory on the planet Vis Uban in the season 7 opener &quot;Fallen&quot;. Daniel rejoins SG-1 full-time one episode later, and Jonas returns to his people. Daniel spends much of season 7 trying to tap into his Ascended memories of his time of Ascension and to find the Lost City of the Ancients. This leads to the discovery of the Ancient Outpost at Antarctica in the season 7 finale &quot;Lost City&quot;, contributing to the spin-off &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. In season 8&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;, Daniel meets Vala Mal Doran, who seizes the &quot;Prometheus&quot; with him on board. Although Daniel evades her sexual advances and thwarts her plans, she escapes. After Daniel&#x27;s death at the hands of RepliCarter in &quot;Reckoning (Part 2)&quot;, Oma Desala provides a path for Daniel to ascend in &quot;Threads&quot;, but Daniel is descended back to Earth naked to live on as a human, this time with full memory of what just happened to him.

In the season 9 opener &quot;Avalon&quot;, Vala seeks out Daniel at Stargate Command (SGC) and prevents him from going to Atlantis. The discovery of an Ancient communication device transports their minds to a village in a distant galaxy where they make contact with the Ori. Vala and Daniel can return to Earth safely, but unintentionally bring the Ori threat to the Milky Way. After Vala is accidentally transported to the Ori galaxy in &quot;Beachhead&quot;, Daniel reunites with Vala aboard one of the invading Ori ships in the season 10 opener &quot;Flesh and Blood.&quot; After their escape, Daniel speaks up in support of Vala&#x27;s request to join the SGC. With the ancient Merlin&#x27;s knowledge, Daniel builds the Sangraal in &quot;The Quest&quot;. Vala&#x27;s rapidly matured daughter Adria captures Daniel and turns him into an Ori Prior in &quot;The Shroud&quot; to convert the Tau&#x27;ri to the path of Origin, but Daniel returns to his normal self at the end of the episode. In &quot;Unending&quot;, the last episode of the series, SG-1 gets stuck in a time dilation field aboard the Earth ship &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and a romance between Vala and Daniel comes to fruition. Before the time dilation field is reversed after fifty years, erasing all linked memories in the process, Daniel and Vala express their feelings for each other.

Jackson makes a cameo appearance in the pilot of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Rising&quot;, where he assists Rodney McKay and Elizabeth Weir on the Antarctic Outpost, unearthed in &quot;SG-1&quot;&#x27;s season 7 finale, &quot;Lost City&quot;. Here, he helps them to persuade Jack O&#x27;Neill to green-light the Atlantis expedition. Furthermore, he makes an appearance in the season 5 episodes &quot;First Contact&quot; and &quot;The Lost Tribe&quot; where he visits Atlantis to study the ancient scientist Janus. Whilst there he and McKay are captured by a rogue branch of Asgard, who wish to use them to activate the &quot;Attero Device&quot; to neutralize the Wraith threat in the galaxy but with the unforeseen consequence of destroying the Stargates which would explode, killing tens of thousands of innocent people.

In the time following the conclusion of Stargate Atlantis, Jackson still works for the Stargate Command (SGC), along with Dr. Nicholas Rush. Jackson is attempting to unlock the 9th Chevron address, which would be later opened by Eli Wallace at the Icarus Base. Jackson assists Dr. Rush&#x27;s research team by recording a series of instructional videos explaining the stargate, the history of the ancients, the stargate addressing system and hyperdrive technology. Wallace watched several of Jackson&#x27;s videos on the way to Icarus base, growing increasingly annoyed at the &quot;in-flight safety tip&quot; type recordings Jackson made.

===Relationships===
Jackson marries Sha&#x27;re due to a misunderstanding on the first mission to Abydos and remains with her for a year on Abydos until she is taken as a host for Amonet (&quot;Children of the Gods&quot;). He remains committed to her until her death in &quot;Forever in a Day&quot;. Prior to this, Daniel&#x27;s moments of (involuntary) infidelity include claiming a young woman in &quot;The Broca Divide&quot; while regressed to a primitive stage of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, is sexually assaulted by Hathor in &quot;Hathor&quot;, and is drugged and held prisoner to be the consort of a young woman named Shyla, the daughter of the planet&#x27;s ruler, in &quot;Need&quot;. After Sha&#x27;re&#x27;s death, Daniel occasionally pursues other relationships: he is briefly drawn to Ke&#x27;ra (who turns out to be Linea, the Destroyer of Worlds) in &quot;Past and Present&quot; and encounters his old girlfriend, Sarah Gardner, between seasons 4 and 7, but he is prevented from taking anything further when Sarah is taken as a host by the long-trapped Goa&#x27;uld Osiris until she is finally released. He also meets Leda in &quot;Icon&quot; who develops feelings for him, although circumstances prevent anything coming of it. Daniel develops a love-hate relationship with Vala Mal Doran between seasons 8 and 10; it is established multiple times that their feelings for each other are far deeper than either of them care to admit. Vala&#x27;s daughter, the Orici Adria, develops an attraction to Daniel while attempting to convert him to the path of Origin during season 10.

On a personal level, Jackson is very close to his teammates on the original SG-1, with each of them constantly depicted as willing to go to great lengths to protect each other, even with such moments as Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s role in Sha&#x27;re being taken by Apophis or Jack distancing himself from the others to go undercover and expose the NID&#x27;s theft of alien artifacts.

Jackson has an antagonistic relationship with Dr. Rodney McKay, as evidenced in season 5 of Stargate: Atlantis. He feels McKay is an arrogant, overbearing, insufferable ass, and can barely hide his dislike for his Atlantis counterpart. McKay&#x27;s feeling is mutual, and they engaged in a verbal sparring match throughout their time together, but they at least have a mutual respect for each other&#x27;s accomplishments.

===Profession===
In the movie &quot;Stargate&quot;, Daniel Jackson, PhD, is presented as having several professional credentials including archaeologist, historian, and linguist. Jackson utilizes his skills in all three fields throughout the film as it becomes evident that he specializes in Egyptology.

Jackson, as an archaeologist, becomes the stereotypical academic – extremely smart, nerdy, socially awkward, and quirky. As a character, which further exemplifies this stereotype, Daniel represents an antithesis to the military stereotype of shoot first, ask questions later. Jackson is frequently depicted as approaching other cultures; past, present, and future, in a culturally sensitive manner, sometimes siding with their interests above those of the military back on Earth. Daniel seems more akin to a pseudo-archaeologist than a scientist. Pseudo-archaeology operates, generally, outside of the empirical and analytical methods of the profession of archaeology, and often is associated with claims of extraterrestrial life, magic, and other phenomena. In the fictional universe of Stargate, Daniel is proven correct about his claims that the Egyptian pyramids are much older than anyone believes, and even finds out they are of extraterrestrial design. As Lynn Meskell observed of the film &quot;Stargate&quot;: “Egypt represents everything Other, everything we cannot fathom or explain, all things ritualized, sacrificed and sexual’ and summed up in the film as the queered, extraterrestrial Ra, like Egypt identified as inexplicable, unnatural and evil...”(1998a:73).

===&quot;Deaths&quot;===
The show&#x27;s staff and writers occasionally make jokes about Daniel&#x27;s frequent &quot;deaths&quot; on the show. In the season 7 episode &quot;Heroes&quot;, one of the SG teams examine some ancient ruins and a scientist says &quot;Dr. Jackson is gonna die when he sees this!&quot; to which another member (Col. David Dixon, played by Adam Baldwin) responds &quot;What, again?&quot;. Comparisons have also been made between Daniel and Kenny from the cartoon series South Park. Daniel&#x27;s first death is by staff blast while he defends O&#x27;Neil; he is resurrected by Ra with a sarcophagus in the film. Daniel flatlines in Season 4&#x27;s &quot;The Light&quot;. He dies of radiation poisoning in season 5&#x27;s &quot;Meridian&quot; and Ascends to a higher plane until he reappears in Season 7&#x27;s &quot;Fallen (part 1)&quot;. He is killed by RepliCarter at the very end of &quot;Reckoning&quot; and is seen at a midway point between Ascension and mortality before finally retaking human form in &quot;Threads&quot;. Daniel is presumed dead after SG-1 is brainwashed to believe this in Season 1&#x27;s &quot;Fire and Water&quot;. Daniel also is killed by Teal&#x27;c several times in a virtual reality system in Season 8&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;. Other deaths generally involve Daniel&#x27;s teammates: they die together in &quot;The Nox&quot; (where they get resurrected by the Nox) and in the alternate future of &quot;2010&quot;; their robot versions are killed in &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot;, Daniel being the first to die; and a Goa&#x27;uld-possessed alternate timeline version of Daniel is shot by Teal&#x27;c in &quot;Moebius&quot;, while in another timeline in the same episode, all of SG-1 are killed &quot;except&quot; Daniel. In the series first instance of an alternate timeline, the Daniel from that timeline is also presumed dead as his last known location is Egypt which is shown to have been attacked by the Goa&#x27;uld. Daniel is also killed in a Goa&#x27;uld invasion in the Stargate Command, replaced by an alternate Daniel in &quot;Stargate SG-1: The Gift of the Gods&quot; from a doppelganger reality. In Daniel is feared dead when he asks Carter and Mitchell to leave him behind while they search for help in the Arctic, only to be rescued by Col. O&#x27;Neill. Jackson is again killed by a Jaffa staff weapon near the end before Mitchell uses Ba&#x27;al&#x27;s time-travel device to prevent Ba&#x27;al invading and conquering Earth.

==Conceptual history==
James Spader was intrigued by the script because he found it &quot;awful&quot;. Mostly because of his manual-labourist view of acting, he accepted the role as a regular job that earned him some money. Michael Shanks was chosen because he did &quot;the perfect imitation of James Spader&quot;, according to Brad Wright. Showtime&#x27;s announcement to not renew &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; after season 5 coincided with Shanks&#x27; decision to leave the show for concerns of being underutilized. Panicking fans started massive write-in fan campaigns to save the show and the character, partly conflating the two issues, but Sci-Fi Channel decided to continue the show and fill the void with a new character. Casting agents met Corin Nemec at the courtyard of MGM&#x27;s Santa Monica offices by chance and offered him the role of Jonas Quinn, beginning with the penultimate season 5 episode &quot;Meridian&quot;.

*The actress portraying Sha&#x27;re (Vaitiare Bandera) was actually pregnant with Michael Shanks&#x27; first child, Tatiana, in season 2.
*In the episode &quot;Nemesis&quot;, Daniel is left behind while the rest of the team helps the Asgard fight off a new threat. Originally he was meant to go with them but the day after Canadian Thanksgiving, Shanks&#x27; appendix ruptured and the appendectomy was written into the script to explain Daniel&#x27;s minimal involvement.

==Reception==

For his portrayal of Daniel Jackson, Michael Shanks was nominated for a Leo Award in 2000 for &quot;Best Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series&quot; in 2000 for the episode &quot;Forever in a Day&quot;. After a 2004 Leo win in the category &quot;Dramatic Series: Best Lead Performance by a Male&quot; for &quot;Lifeboat&quot;, Shanks was nominated for a 2005 Leo Award in the same category for the episode &quot;Threads&quot;. Shanks was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category &quot;Best Supporting Actor on Television&quot; in 2001, 2004 and 2005.

<text>The hectometre, (SI symbol: hm), spelt hectometer in American and Philippine English, is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI), equal to one hundred metres and to one tenth of a kilometre. The word comes from a combination of &quot;metre&quot; and the SI prefix &quot;hecto-&quot;, meaning &quot;hundred&quot;. It is not commonly used in English. A football field (either soccer or American) is approximately 1 hectometre in length. The hectare (ha), a common metric unit for land area, is equal to one square hectometre (hm2).

The hectometer has sometimes been used for expressing the distance to a target in warfare.

<text>Aspropyrgos () is a western suburb, in the Athens metropolitan area and a municipality in the West Attica regional unit in the Thriasio Plain, Attica, Greece. The municipality had a population of 31,381 at the 2021 census. It has an area of 101.983 km2.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Aspropyrgos&#x27; is derived from the Greek words , meaning &#x27;white&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;castle&#x27; or &#x27;tower&#x27;.

==Geography==
Aspropyrgos is located 15 km northwest of the city center of Athens in the Thriasio Plain. It is 5 km northeast of Elefsina, near the Saronic Gulf coast. Mount Parnitha forms its northern border, and the Aigaleo hills its southeastern border. The Elefsina Military Airbase lies to its west. 
The main street is Dimokratias (&#x27;Democracy&#x27;) Avenue. Aspropyrgos can be accessed from the A6 motorway (Elefsina - Athens International Airport) and the A65 motorway (Ano Liosia - Aspropyrgos). It is also accessible through A6 exit 4. (The industrial area is in the southeastern part of Aspropyrgos. The Aspropyrgos railway station is served by Proastiakos trains from the Athens International Airport to Kiato (Peloponnese).

==Climate==
Aspropyrgos has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;) closely bordering a hot-summer mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;) climate, with mild winters and hot summers. Owing to its location 
in the Thriasio Plain the area is particularly vulnerable to high temperatures and has experienced some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in Greece and Continental Europe. In June 2007 the meteorological station of the Aspropyrgos Municipality located in the Germanika area of Aspropyrgos registered 47.5 °C. Also, in June 2017, July 2017 and August 2021, Aspropyrgos recorded temperatures of around 45 °C.

==Industry==
Aspropyrgos consists of a residential downtown area and an industrial area where a number of storage warehouses, metal recycling facilities, logistics handlers, wholesalers, small construction companies and other industrial businesses operate.
The Aspropyrgos Refinery, south of the city and next to the sea, has been producing oil for many years. It is the largest in Greece (together with the Eleusis refinery), with an annual capacity of . As a consequence, pollution has been a problem for years. The refinery includes depots in the southern and eastern parts, and some in the western part and at a dock to the southwest.

<text>George Foster Peabody (; July 27, 1852 – March 4, 1938) was an American banker and philanthropist.

==Early life==
He was born to George Henry Peabody and Elvira Peabody (&quot;née&quot; Canfield) as the first of four children. Both parents were New Englanders of colonial ancestry. George Henry Peabody, who came from a line of merchants, bankers and professional men, had moved from Connecticut to Columbus, Georgia, where he ran a prosperous general store. After attending private school in Columbus, young Peabody spent a few months at Deer Hill Institute in Danbury, Connecticut. The Civil War, however, impoverished his family, and in 1866 they moved to Brooklyn, New York, and young Peabody went to work as an errand boy.

==Business career==
In the evenings Peabody read extensively at the library of the Brooklyn YMCA, which he later called his &quot;alma mater&quot;. He also took part in the activities of the Reformed Church in Brooklyn Heights, where he met and became good friends with young investment banker Spencer Trask. On May 2, 1881, Peabody became a partner in the new firm of Spencer Trask &amp; Company. During the 1880s and 1890s this investment house took a leading part in financing electric lighting corporations, beet sugar and other industrial enterprises, and railroad construction in the western United States and Mexico. Peabody himself handled most of the firm&#x27;s railroad investments, working in close association with William J. Palmer. He also became a director in numerous corporations. Peabody, his brother Charles Jones Peabody and Spencer Trask amassed a great portion of their wealth from the Edison Electric Company. Trask served as president of Edison Electric Illuminating, and when J. P. Morgan—protégé of New England businessman/philanthropist George Peabody—financier of Edison Electric, merged all into the General Electric Company in 1892, George Foster Peabody became a member of the GE board of directors. Peabody had investments in Mexico, particularly in railways, along with many other U.S. financiers in the late nineteenth century. He was director of the Mexican National Railroad; and had holdings in Yucatán, where he was involved in commercial henequen exports, a natural twine used for binding wheat; was a director of the Intercontinental Rubber Company, founded by Bernard Baruch; and provided capital for mining enterprises.

==Social activism==
Peabody retired from business in 1906 to pursue a life of public service. Long interested in social causes, he supported such progressive ideas as the single tax as advocated by Henry George in his book &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, free trade, women&#x27;s suffrage and government ownership of railroads. He was active in the anti-war movement and also interested in education, particularly in the South and particularly for African-Americans. He was a co-founder, director and treasurer of the General Education Board, the Southern Education Board, and the Anna T. Jeanes Foundation. He also served on the board of trustees for the American Church Institute for Negroes, Hampton University in Virginia, Tuskegee University in Alabama, the University of Georgia, and the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. He was secretary of the Southern Education Board.

==Political activities==
From early in his life Peabody was interested in Democratic Party politics. In the early 1880s, he helped his close friend Edward M. Shepard organize the Young Men&#x27;s Democratic Club of Brooklyn, took a part in the 1892 presidential campaign on behalf of Grover Cleveland, supported the Gold Democrats against William Jennings Bryan in 1896, then switched to more moderate monetary reform as a member of the executive committee of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention in 1897. In 1904–1906, he served as treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. Although he declined to run for political office, and declined President Wilson&#x27;s offer of a place on the Federal Trade Commission, Peabody was an unofficial counselor to many government officials. From 1914 to 1921 he served on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. In June 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then Governor of New York, visited Peabody for advice and support in deciding to run for President of the United States.

==Philanthropic activities==
Peabody served from 1884 to 1930 as a trustee of Hampton University, one of Virginia&#x27;s historically black universities, where he established in the university library the Peabody Collection of rare materials on African-American history, one of the largest collections in the United States.

In 1901, Peabody donated land for Peabody Park at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

He funded YMCA of Metropolitan Columbus, in Georgia, built in 1903, believed to be the only marble &quot;Y&quot; building in the United States.

==Warm Springs, Georgia==
After years of visiting the estate of his partner Spencer Trask in Saratoga Springs, New York Peabody agreed to succeed him in 1910 as chairman of the state commission set up to purchase and conserve the famous spa there, and in 1923 he acquired the property at Warm Springs, Georgia near his boyhood home. In 1924 he invited his friend Franklin Delano Roosevelt (who had recently contracted a paralytic illness) to visit the 90 degree Fahrenheit springs there, which Roosevelt eventually purchased and turned into the Little White House and the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, expanding it from a limited rehab center into a full-service center.

==Honorary degrees==
While his formal education was limited and he had no college degree, Peabody received honorary degrees from Harvard and Washington and Lee Universities in 1903, and the University of Georgia in 1906. This latter institution was the recipient of much of Peabody&#x27;s philanthropy, including funds to build a fireproof building to house the university&#x27;s library. He also donated land to help reorganize the State College of Agriculture, and founded the university&#x27;s School of Forestry.

==Personal life==
A tall man, in later years he developed a mane of white hair, and wore a heavy mustache and pointed beard, becoming known for his dignified and courtly manner. He maintained a mansion in Brooklyn, where he entertained lavishly. He also purchased a summer home known as Abenia at Lake George, where he spent most of each year. He was frequently a guest at Yaddo, the Saratoga Springs estate of Spencer Trask and his wife, Katrina Trask, and from both estates he developed a wide circle of influence, including many persons from the literary world, church, business, and government, who came to enjoy his gracious hospitality.

A longtime bachelor, in 1921, eleven years after Trask&#x27;s death in a railroad accident, Peabody married Trask&#x27;s widow Katrina, and they lived at Yaddo until her death in 1922. Thereafter, Yaddo became a great retreat for artists. Peabody continued to live on the estate, and in 1926, he adopted a daughter, Mrs. Marjorie P. Waite, a young woman whom he had come to know in connection with his civic and humanitarian activities and who aided him in them.

Peabody died in 1938 at his home in Warm Springs, Georgia.

==George Foster Peabody Awards==
The George Foster Peabody Awards was established by the National Association of Broadcasters. It has been presented annually since 1941 for excellence in radio and, since 1948, television broadcasting, followed by World Wide Web content in the late 1990s. The award is administered by the University of Georgia&#x27;s Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication and was named for Peabody, a benefactor of the university.
