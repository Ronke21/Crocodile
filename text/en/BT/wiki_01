<text>HNLMS &quot;Jacob van Heemskerck&quot; was the second and last of the destroyer leaders of the Royal Netherlands Navy, named after Admiral Jacob van Heemskerk (1567–1607).

Originally designated as a flotilla leader and a torpedo cruiser in Decker&#x27;s Fleet Plan of 1931, she was hastily commissioned on 10 May 1940, when Germany invaded the Netherlands. However, as she was not armed she escaped to the United Kingdom, where she was refitted as an air defence cruiser, since these were the only type of gun available, and there was a growing need for this type of ship to protect the convoys. During the Second World War the crew felt that their ship was blessed and gave her the nickname &quot;Oude Jacob&quot; (Old Jacob). She received the reputation for proficiency, and not a single convoy ship would be lost when she was on duty.

== Service history==
The ship was meant to commence trials on the day the Germans invaded, and to prevent her capture the &quot;Jacob van Heemskerck&quot; was immediately pressed into service. Since she had no armament she left port for the United Kingdom with only a skeleton crew. Once she had arrived in Portsmouth attempts were made to give her weaponry of some sort. She received depth charge equipment from the old torpedo boats &quot;G13&quot; and &quot;G15&quot;. On 18 May 1940, Queen Wilhelmina paid the ship a visit. At the end of the month, &quot;Jacob van Heemskerck&quot; and the cruiser received the assignment to transport Princess Juliana and her two children (including the later Beatrix of the Netherlands) to Canada. The ships put to sea on 2 June and arrived on 11 June at Halifax.

&quot;Jacob van Heemskerck&quot; returned alone to England and arrived at Portsmouth in July where her re-arming programme began. The British Admiralty decided to convert her to an anti-aircraft ship. Work was completed on 17 February 1941, and after sea trials, which lasted till 29 February, the ship was assigned as a convoy escort in the Atlantic Ocean as part of the Irish Sea Escort.

She was removed from escort duty in January 1942 and sent to the Dutch East Indies to reinforce the defence fleet assembled there. The ship arrived too late to take part in the battle of the Java Sea and was reassigned to the Eastern Fleet in 1942. In September 1942 the ship took part in operations &#x27;Stream&#x27; and &#x27;Jane&#x27;, both aimed at the retaking of Madagascar. On 25 October &quot;Jacob van Heemskerck&quot; arrived at Fremantle, Australia, and came under the command of Allied Naval Forces Western Australia, where she performed convoy duties.

On 28 November 1942, &quot;Jacob van Heemskerck&quot;, in the company of the Australian cruiser , identified and intercepted the German supply vessel and blockade runner &quot;Ramses&quot; in the Indian Ocean while posing as a Norwegian ship; the German freighter was subsequently scuttled by her own crew and finished off by the Allied warships.

On 1 December 1943, the ship returned to the Eastern Fleet and on 27 December, she set sail for the Mediterranean Sea where she, again, performed convoy duties till she was recalled to England for maintenance in June 1944.

On 26 July 1945 &quot;Jacob van Heemskerck&quot; arrived at Amsterdam, the first Dutch warship to do so after Liberation Day. In September of that year she set sail for the Dutch East Indies, where she performed patrol duties until 22 July 1946. She returned to the Netherlands in August of that year.

===Post-war===
From 12 March 1951 she served as a barracks ship for naval trainees in Vlissingen. She served in this capacity in several other locations. The cruiser was decommissioned on 20 November 1969, and was struck from the Naval Registry on 27 February 1970. On 23 June 1970 the ship was sold for scrap.

<text>Hyperelliptic curve cryptography is similar to elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) insofar as the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve is an abelian group in which to do arithmetic, just as we use the group of points on an elliptic curve in ECC.

==Definition==
An (imaginary) hyperelliptic curve of genus formula_1 over a field formula_2 is given by the equation formula_3 where formula_4 is a polynomial of degree not larger than formula_1 and formula_6 is a monic polynomial of degree formula_7. From this definition it follows that elliptic curves are hyperelliptic curves of genus 1. In hyperelliptic curve cryptography formula_2 is often a finite field. The Jacobian of formula_9, denoted formula_10, is a quotient group, thus the elements of the Jacobian are not points, they are equivalence classes of divisors of degree 0 under the relation of linear equivalence. This agrees with the elliptic curve case, because it can be shown that the Jacobian of an elliptic curve is isomorphic with the group of points on the elliptic curve. The use of hyperelliptic curves in cryptography came about in 1989 from Neal Koblitz. Although introduced only 3 years after ECC, not many cryptosystems implement hyperelliptic curves because the implementation of the arithmetic isn&#x27;t as efficient as with cryptosystems based on elliptic curves or factoring (RSA). The efficiency of implementing the arithmetic depends on the underlying finite field formula_2, in practice it turns out that finite fields of characteristic 2 are a good choice for hardware implementations while software is usually faster in odd characteristic.

The Jacobian on a hyperelliptic curve is an Abelian group and as such it can serve as group for the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). In short, suppose we have an Abelian group formula_12 and formula_1 an element of formula_12, the DLP on formula_12 entails finding the integer formula_16 given two elements of formula_12, namely formula_1 and formula_19. The first type of group used was the multiplicative group of a finite field, later also Jacobians of (hyper)elliptic curves were used. If the hyperelliptic curve is chosen with care, then Pollard&#x27;s rho method is the most efficient way to solve DLP. This means that, if the Jacobian has formula_20 elements, that the running time is exponential in formula_21. This makes it possible to use Jacobians of a fairly small order, thus making the system more efficient. But if the hyperelliptic curve is chosen poorly, the DLP will become quite easy to solve. In this case there are known attacks which are more efficient than generic discrete logarithm solvers or even subexponential. Hence these hyperelliptic curves must be avoided. Considering various attacks on DLP, it is possible to list the features of hyperelliptic curves that should be avoided.

==Attacks against the DLP==
All generic attacks on the discrete logarithm problem in finite abelian groups such as the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm and Pollard&#x27;s rho method can be used to attack the DLP in the Jacobian of hyperelliptic curves. The Pohlig-Hellman attack reduces the difficulty of the DLP by looking at the order of the group we are working with. Suppose the group formula_12 that is used has formula_23 elements, where formula_24 is the prime factorization of formula_20. Pohlig-Hellman reduces the DLP in formula_12 to DLPs in subgroups of order formula_27 for formula_28. So for formula_29 the largest prime divisor of formula_20, the DLP in formula_12 is just as hard to solve as the DLP in the subgroup of order formula_29. Therefore, we would like to choose formula_12 such that the largest prime divisor formula_29 of formula_35 is almost equal to formula_20 itself. Requiring formula_37 usually suffices.

The index calculus algorithm is another algorithm that can be used to solve DLP under some circumstances. For Jacobians of (hyper)elliptic curves there exists an index calculus attack on DLP. If the genus of the curve becomes too high, the attack will be more efficient than Pollard&#x27;s rho. Today it is known that even a genus of formula_38 cannot assure security. Hence we are left with elliptic curves and hyperelliptic curves of genus 2.

Another restriction on the hyperelliptic curves we can use comes from the Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone-attack / Frey-Rück-attack. The first, often called MOV for short, was developed in 1993, the second came about in 1994. Consider a (hyper)elliptic curve formula_9 over a finite field formula_40 where formula_41 is the power of a prime number. Suppose the Jacobian of the curve has formula_20 elements and formula_29 is the largest prime divisor of formula_20. For formula_45 the smallest positive integer such that formula_46 there exists a computable injective group homomorphism from the subgroup of formula_10 of order formula_29 to formula_49. If formula_45 is small, we can solve DLP in formula_10 by using the index calculus attack in formula_52. For arbitrary curves formula_45 is very large (around the size of formula_54); so even though the index calculus attack is quite fast for multiplicative groups of finite fields this attack is not a threat for most curves. The injective function used in this attack is a pairing and there are some applications in cryptography that make use of them. In such applications it is important to balance the hardness of the DLP in formula_10 and formula_52; depending on the security level values of formula_45 between 6 and 12 are useful.
The subgroup of formula_52 is a torus. There exists some independent usage in torus based cryptography.

We also have a problem, if formula_29, the largest prime divisor of the order of the Jacobian, is equal to the characteristic of formula_60 By a different injective map we could then consider the DLP in the additive group formula_61 instead of DLP on the Jacobian. However, DLP in this additive group is trivial to solve, as can easily be seen. So also these curves, called anomalous curves, are not to be used in DLP.

==Order of the Jacobian==
Hence, in order to choose a good curve and a good underlying finite field, it is important to know the order of the Jacobian. Consider a hyperelliptic curve formula_62 of genus formula_63 over the field formula_64 where formula_65 is the power of a prime number and define formula_66 as formula_62 but now over the field formula_68. It can be shown that the order of the Jacobian of formula_66 lies in the interval formula_70, called the Hasse-Weil interval. 

But there is more, we can compute the order using the zeta-function on hyperelliptic curves. Let formula_71 be the number of points on formula_66. Then we define the zeta-function of formula_73 as formula_74. For this zeta-function it can be shown that formula_75 where formula_76 is a polynomial of degree formula_77 with coefficients in formula_78. Furthermore formula_76 factors as formula_80 where formula_81 for all formula_82. Here formula_83 denotes the complex conjugate of formula_16. Finally we have that the order of formula_85 equals formula_86. Hence orders of Jacobians can be found by computing the roots of formula_76.

<text>Annandale and Eskdale is a committee area in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It covers the areas of Annandale and Eskdale, the straths of the River Annan and the River Esk respectively. From 1975 until 1996 it was a local government district.

==History==
The two straths of Eskdale and Annandale had each been medieval provinces of Scotland, with Annandale being a stewartry and Eskdale a lordship. The provinces were gradually eclipsed in importance by the shires as the main unit of local administration, with Annandale and Eskdale coming to be seen as two of the three divisions of Dumfriesshire, the other being Nithsdale. Dumfriesshire was administered by commissioners of supply from 1667 and by a county council from 1890. The hereditary jurisdictions of Eskdale and Annandale ended with the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746.

A local government district called Annandale and Eskdale was created on 16 May 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Annandale and Eskdale was one of four districts created within the region of Dumfries and Galloway. The district covered the eastern part of Dumfriesshire, covering the whole area of ten former districts and part of an eleventh, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Annan Burgh
*Annan District
*Dumfries District (parishes of Dalton and Lochmaben, rest went to Nithsdale)
*Gretna District
*Langholm Burgh
*Langholm District
*Lochmaben Burgh
*Lockerbie Burgh
*Lockerbie District
*Moffat Burgh
*Moffat District

For lieutenancy purposes, the last lord-lieutenant of the county of Dumfriesshire was made lord-lieutenant for the combined area of Annandale and Eskdale and the neighbouring district of Nithsdale when the reforms came into effect in 1975.

Further local government reform in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the four districts of Dumfries and Galloway abolished, with Dumfries and Galloway Council taking over their functions. The council continues to use the former Annandale and Eskdale district as the basis of an area committee, alongside committees for the other three abolished districts of Nithsdale, Stewartry and Wigtown, subject to some adjustments of boundaries where ward boundaries no longer follow the pre-1996 district boundaries. The Dumfries lieutenancy area continues to cover the combined area of the pre-1996 Annandale and Eskdale and Nithsdale districts.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:
==Premises==

The council was based at the District Council Chambers in Annan, which formed part of Annan Town Hall. The town hall had originally been built between 1875 and 1878. The council built itself a large extension to the north of the town hall alongside Battery Street, with its main entrance to the right of the old town hall. Since the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building has been an area office of Dumfries and Galloway Council.

<text>Billingsgate Fish Market is the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest inland fish market. It takes its name from Billingsgate, a ward in the south-east corner of the City of London, where the riverside market was originally established. In its original location in the 19th century, Billingsgate was the largest fish market in the world. The current market is located off Trafalgar Way in Poplar, east London - at the eastern end of the North Dock of the West India Docks.

==History==

===City of London===


Billingsgate Wharf, close to Lower Thames Street, became the centre of a fish market during the 16th and 17th centuries but did not become formally established until the (10 Will. 3. c. 13).

In 1850, the market, according to Horace Jones, &quot;consisted only of shed buildings ... The open space on the north of the well-remembered Billingsgate Dock was dotted with low booths and sheds, with a range of wooden houses with a piazza in front on the west, which served the salesmen and fishmongers as shelter, and for the purposes of carrying on their trade.&quot; In that year the market was rebuilt to a design by J. B. Bunning, the City architect.

Bunning&#x27;s building was soon found to be insufficient for the increased trade, and in 1872 the Corporation obtained an act of Parliament to rebuild and enlarge the market, which was done to plans by Bunning&#x27;s successor as City architect Sir Horace Jones. The new site covered almost twice the area of the old, incorporating Billingsgate Stairs and Wharf and Darkhouse Lane. Work began in 1874, and the new market was opened by the Lord Mayor on 20 July 1877. The new buildings, Italianate in style, had on their long frontages towards Thames Street the river, a pedimented centre and continuous arcade, flanked at each end by a pavilion tavern. The general market, on a level with Thames Street, had an area of about , and was covered with louvre glass roofs, high at the ridge. A gallery wide was allocated to the sale of dried fish, while the basement served as a market for shellfish. Electric lighting was also furnished in November 1878 via 16 Jablochkoff Candles.

The opening of the railways changed the nature of the trade, and by the late nineteenth century most of the fish arrived at the market via the Great Eastern Railway.

The infamously coarse language of London fishmongers made &quot;Billingsgate&quot; a byword for crude or vulgar language. One of its earliest uses can be seen in a 1577 chronicle by Raphael Holinshed, where the writer makes reference to the foul tongues of Billingsgate oyster-wives. The market is depicted during Tudor times in Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1951 children&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Armourer&#x27;s House&quot;. The writer George Orwell worked at Billingsgate in the 1930s, as did the Kray twins in the 1950s.

===Poplar===
In 1982, the fish market was relocated to a new building complex on the Isle of Dogs in Poplar, close to Canary Wharf and Blackwall. The freehold owner of the site is the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, but the City of London Corporation still runs the market; they pay an annual ground rent stipulated in an agreement between the two councils as &quot;the gift of one fish&quot;. Most of the fish sold through the market now arrives there by road, from ports as far afield as Aberdeen and Cornwall.

Billingsgate Market is open from Tuesday to Saturday. Trading commences at 4 a.m. and finishes at 8:30 a.m. Security for the market is provided by the private Market Constabulary.

Traditionally, the only people allowed to move fish around the market were licensed fish porters. The role dates back at least to Henry VIII, and was officially recognised by the Corporation of London in 1632. In 2012, a bitter battle was fought between modernisers and traditionalists. The modernisers won and the role of the porters ended.

==Future==
In early 2019, the City of London Corporation&#x27;s main decision-making body, the Court of Common Council, proposed that Billingsgate, New Spitalfields Market and Smithfield Market should move to a new consolidated site in Dagenham Dock. A formal planning application was made in June 2020, and received outline permission in March 2021. The new consolidated market was expected to become operational in 2027/2028, when the Billingsgate Market site would be available for redevelopment.

However, in November 2024, the council announced it did not intend to proceed with these plans as they were no longer economically viable; instead, Billingsgate Fish Market and Smithfield Market would close in or after 2028 with no replacements.

<text>HNLMS &quot;Tromp&quot; was the lead ship of the destroyer leaders built for the Royal Netherlands Navy. Built just prior to World War II, the ship served mainly in the Pacific and Indian Oceans against the Japanese, being based out of Sydney, Fremantle and Trincomalee where she served alongside British, Australian and US warships. After the war, she returned to the Netherlands; after 1949, &quot;Tromp&quot; was used as a training and accommodation ship, before being decommissioned in 1955, and scrapped in 1969.

==Design and description==


Originally designated as a flotilla leader in the Deckers Fleet Plan of 1931, &quot;Tromp&quot; was ordered in 1935 and laid down at the Nederlandsche Scheepsbouw Maatschappij (Netherlands Shipbuilding Company), in Amsterdam, on 17 January 1936. She was launched on 24 May 1937 and then commissioned into the Royal Netherlands Navy on 18 August 1938. She was named after Admirals Maarten Tromp and Cornelis Tromp.

&quot;Tromp&quot; was long, had a beam of and a draught of . She displaced 3,450 tons at standard load with 860 tons of bunkerage. Powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, with four Yarrow boilers that drove two shafts and produced , she was capable of achieving a maximum speed of . Upon construction, the ship&#x27;s complement was 295, although this later increased to 380.

Her armament consisted of six guns twin-mounted in three turrets, as well as two twin-mounted 40 mm Bofors guns. As built, she also had two twin-mounted .50 calibre machine guns, although these were later replaced with two single-mounted 20 mm Oerlikons. In addition, for anti-aircraft defence, she was later fitted out with an extra six 20 mm Oerlikon machine guns, four US-made 75 mm guns and four more 40 mm Bofors. She also carried six torpedo tubes in two banks of three, and was equipped with a Fokker C.XIW floatplane. Her anti-submarine features included ASDIC, a hydrophone, and four depth-charge throwers. Her deck armour was , while her side belt armour was . Upon her commissioning, &quot;Tromp&quot; was one of the most powerful ships in the Dutch navy.

==Service history==

Following her commissioning, &quot;Tromp&quot; carried out working up manoeuvres until early January 1939 when she departed Rotterdam, bound for the Mediterranean. Transiting via Lisbon, in Portugal, on 15 January, she was lightly damaged when she accidentally collided with the German passenger ship &quot;Orinoco&quot;. She returned to the Netherlands in April to take part in the fleet review at Scheveningen, before participating in a cruise to Norway, where she stopped over at Oslo. In July 1939, Commander J. W. Termijtelen took over command of the ship from Captain L.A.C.M. Doorman and under Termijtelen&#x27;s command the ship sailed for the Netherlands East Indies in August 1939, arriving just after the outbreak of World War II in Europe.

In mid-September 1939, the ship searched several German merchantmen in Padang, before proceeding to Surabaya for a refit. Throughout 1940, the ship undertook patrol and escort duties as part of the Netherlands East Indies Squadron before escorting ships of the Java–New York Line in a convoy to the Gilbert Islands in early 1941. A new captain, Commander J.B. de Meester, arrived in July. In the final months of 1941, tensions in the region began to heighten amidst concerns about war with Japan and in November 1941 &quot;Tromp&quot; was involved in searches of Vichy French merchant vessels operating in the area. In late November and early December 1941, &quot;Tromp&quot; moved to the western Java Sea to help search for , which was missing after encountering the German raider &quot;Kormoran&quot;.

Following the outbreak of fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific, she was assigned to the Combined Striking Force, ABDA Command, in January 1942 for the defence of the East Indies. &quot;Tromp&quot; was badly damaged off Bali on 18 February 1942 during the Battle of Badung Strait, when she was hit by eleven 5-inch (127 mm) shells from the Japanese destroyer . Her return fire hit two Japanese destroyers, killing four men on &quot;Asashio&quot; and seven on . The ship was then sent to Australia for repairs in February 1942, sailing firstly to Fremantle and then on to Sydney.
Repairs were completed by May 1942, at which time she began a period of sea trials. These were interrupted by anti-submarine patrols off Newcastle in the middle of the month after the Soviet steamer &quot;Wellen&quot; was attacked, but these patrols proved uneventful. On 18 May 1942, in company with , &quot;Tromp&quot; escorted convoy &quot;ZK.8&quot; out of Sydney composed of the Dutch ships , , and bound for Port Moresby with 4,735 troops of the Australian 14th Brigade. Afterwards, &quot;Tromp&quot; escorted several more north-bound convoys before completing its sea trials in early June. The following month she departed Sydney bound for Fremantle, escorting a westward-bound convoy. She remained in Fremantle until October 1942 when the ship returned to Sydney to replace her radar. Upon completion, she undertook a visit to New Zealand before returning to Fremantle at the end of the year in concert with a British troopship, &quot;Nestor&quot;.
In February 1943, while based out of Fremantle, &quot;Tromp&quot; was assigned to the US Seventh Fleet, tasked with conducting convoy escort around Australia and in the Indian Ocean. Throughout the year, &quot;Tromp&quot; undertook further convoy escorts until October when Commander F. Stam arrived to take over command. In January 1944, &quot;Tromp&quot; was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet based at Colombo, in Ceylon. A short time later, she was transferred to the fleet base at Trincomalee. The ship then participated in raids on Sabang in April and Surabaya in May 1944, undertaking escort duty in between. She transferred to Sydney for a refit in September 1944, remaining there until February 1945, when &quot;Tromp&quot; returned to Trincomalee to undertake further escort duty. In the final months of the war, &quot;Tromp&quot; was part of the Allied fleet that bombarded Japanese positions prior to the Australian 7th Division&#x27;s landing at Balikpapan during operations to recapture Borneo from the Japanese.

Following the end of the hostilities, &quot;Tromp&quot; was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet and in September 1945 deployed to Jakarta where she landed marines who re-occupied the governor&#x27;s residence as Allied forces arrived to disarm the Japanese garrison. She then ferried liberated Dutch prisoners-of-war between Singapore, Bangkok and Sydney during the final months of the year. She remained in Sydney until February 1946 when she sailed for the Netherlands to return over 150 former prisoners-of-war. Upon her return to the Netherlands in May 1946, the ship underwent a significant refit which lasted until mid-1948. From 1949, &quot;Tromp&quot; was used mainly as a training or accommodation ship, before being decommissioned in 1955 and scrapped in 1969.

<text>Nithsdale (), also known as Strathnith, Stranith or Stranit, is the strath or dale of the River Nith in southern Scotland. Nithsdale was one of the medieval provinces of Scotland. The provinces gradually lost their administrative importance to the shires created from the twelfth century, with Nithsdale forming part of Dumfriesshire. A Nithsdale district covering a similar area to the medieval province was created in 1975, based in the area&#x27;s main town of Dumfries. The district was abolished in 1996, since when the area has been directly administered by Dumfries and Galloway Council.

==History==

The name &quot;Strath Nid&quot; may represent the Cumbric &quot;Ystrad Nidd&quot;; Cumbric (a variety of Common Brittonic) was the dominant language in this area from before Roman times until the 11th or 12th century, whereas Gaelic influence here was late and transient. The River Nith flows north to south through the Southern Uplands in south-west Scotland, separating the Lowther Hills from the Scaur Hills. Nithsdale was historically a strategically important area, lying on some of the main routes from England to the south into the rest of Scotland. These routes were important for trade, but were also of military importance during the Wars of Scottish Independence and Anglo-Scottish Wars.

The province of Nithsdale bordered Annandale to the east, Clydesdale to the north, Kyle to the north-west and Galloway to the west. By 1305 the area was part of the shire of Dumfries. The sheriff of Dumfries also had nominal jurisdiction over neighbouring Annandale and Eskdale, but those two areas retained a large degree of independence with their own hereditary rulers, such that Nithsdale was the main area where the authority of the sheriff of Dumfries practically applied. The title Earl of Nithsdale was created in 1620 for Robert Maxwell of Caerlaverock Castle, but the title was forfeited in 1716 following the involvement of William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale, in the Jacobite rising of 1715.

Gradually the shire became the more significant unit of local government than the provinces. Commissioners of Supply were created for each shire in 1667, and many of the old provinces (including Annandale and Eskdale) lost their hereditary rulers under the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746. The custom continued of describing Dumfriesshire as comprising three divisions called Annandale, Nithsdale and Eskdale. Dumfriesshire County Council was established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889.

==Nithsdale District==

A local government district called Nithsdale was created on 16 May 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Nithsdale district was one of four districts created within the region of Dumfries and Galloway. The district covered the western part of Dumfriesshire, and also included the parishes of Kirkbean, Kirkpatrick Irongray, New Abbey, Terregles, and Troqueer, which had formerly been in Kirkcudbrightshire.

In terms of pre-1975 districts, Nithsdale district covered parts of seven former districts, which were all abolished at the same time. The Eastern District had been in Kirkcudbrightshire prior to the reforms, whereas all the other districts had been part of Dumfriesshire.
*Dumfries Burgh
*Dumfries District, except the parishes of Dalton and Lochmaben (which went to Annandale and Eskdale)
*Eastern District
*Sanquhar Burgh
*Thornhill
*Upper Nithsdale District

For lieutenancy purposes, the last lord-lieutenant of the county of Dumfriesshire was made lord-lieutenant for the combined area of Nithsdale and the neighbouring district of Annandale and Eskdale when the reforms came into effect in 1975.

Further local government reform in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the four districts of Dumfries and Galloway abolished, with Dumfries and Galloway Council taking over their functions. The council continues to use the former Nithsdale district as the basis of an area committee, alongside committees for the other three abolished districts of Annandale and Eskdale, Stewartry and Wigtown, subject to some adjustments of boundaries where ward boundaries no longer follow the pre-1996 district boundaries. The Dumfries lieutenancy area continues to cover the combined area of the pre-1996 Nithsdale and Annandale and Eskdale districts.

===Political control===
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:
===Premises===

Nithsdale District Council was based at the Municipal Buildings on Buccleuch Street in Dumfries, the district&#x27;s largest town. The building had been built in 1932 as the headquarters of the former Dumfries Burgh Council.

<text>Stewartry was a local government district from 1975 until 1996 within the Dumfries and Galloway region in south-west Scotland. Under the name the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright the area of the former district is still used as a lieutenancy area. Dumfries and Galloway Council has a Stewartry area committee which approximately covers the same area, subject to some adjustments where ward boundaries no longer follow the pre-1996 district boundary. The Stewartry covers the majority of the historic county of Kirkcudbrightshire, and derives its name from the county&#x27;s alternative name of &quot;The Stewartry of Kirkcudbright&quot;.

==History==
Stewartry district was created on 16 May 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Stewartry district was one of four districts created within the region of Dumfries and Galloway. The district covered the majority of the former administrative county of Kirkcudbrightshire, excluding the parishes of Kirkmabreck and Minnigaff on the western edge of the county, which went to Wigtown district, and the parishes of Kirkbean, Kirkpatrick Irongray, New Abbey, Terregles, and Troqueer on the eastern edge of the county, which went to Nithsdale. The district&#x27;s name was derived from the alternative name for Kirkcudbrightshire as the &quot;Stewartry of Kirkcudbright&quot;, referencing the fact that the area had previously been administered by a steward rather than a sheriff. The district&#x27;s legal name was just &quot;Stewartry&quot;, but in common usage the area is generally referred to as &quot;the Stewartry&quot;.

For lieutenancy purposes, the last lord-lieutenant of the county of Kirkcudbrightshire was made lord-lieutenant for the new Stewartry district when it came into effect in 1975.

Further local government reform in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the four districts of Dumfries and Galloway abolished, with Dumfries and Galloway Council taking over their functions. The council continues to use the former Stewartry district as the basis of an area committee, alongside committees for the other three abolished districts of Annandale and Eskdale, Nithsdale, and Wigtown, subject to some adjustments of boundaries where ward boundaries no longer follow the pre-1996 district boundaries. The area of the former district also continues to be used for lieutenancy purposes as the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright lieutenancy area.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats were held by independents:
==Premises==

Stewartry District Council was based at the former headquarters of the abolished Kirkcudbrightshire County Council, being a converted pair of late 18th century houses called the County Buildings at 121–123 High Street in Kirkcudbright, with a large extension built in 1952 to the rear facing Daar Road. Since the district council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building has been an area office of Dumfries and Galloway Council.

<text>The Worshipful Company of World Traders is one of the 111 Livery Companies of the City of London.

The Guild of World Traders was constructed in 1985 and it became a Company in 1993. Its petition for livery status was granted by the Court of Aldermen with effect from 2000. The Worshipful Company draws its membership from the international trade fraternity, with the aim of raising awareness and understanding of, and standards of practice in, world trade. The Company ranks 101st in the order of precedence of the City Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Commerce and Honest Friendship with All&quot;, taken from Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s inaugural Presidential speech.

==Inspiration and creation as a Guild==

The founding of the World Traders Association movement gave rise to the creation of trading complexes in over 160 cities throughout the world. London was the first in Europe, built in St Katharine Docks beside the Tower of London (though this World Trade Centre closed in 1994). Over 1,000 years earlier the same land was used by the Knighten Guilde to trade in foreign goods, and in 1979 the then Lord Mayor, Sir Peter Gadsden, suggested that this tradition be revived by the creation of the Guild of World Traders to represent members of the international trading community in the City of London.

The Company&#x27;s founding Master was Mr Peter Drew OBE. From the outset the World Traders were determined to be a working Guild, only accepting members from the international trade fraternity, with the aim of raising awareness and understanding of, and standards of practice in, world trade.

The Company is a member of the Financial Services Group of Livery Companies.

==Activities==
Members of World Traders consist of people with an interest in world trade. Many are brokers, traders or linked to financial services. As well as UK-based British nationals, a significant number of the Livery are overseas nationals based in the UK, dual nationals, British nationals who live overseas and overseas nationals who live in their home country.

The Company’s hallmark annual event is the &quot;Tacitus Lecture&quot;, begun in 1988, now one of the largest intellectual events in the City of London’s calendar. The event gives a senior individual an opportunity to initiate a discussion of serious concerns about world trade in a global forum.

==Key dates==
23 November 1974 General Assembly of the World Trade Centers Association held at London Guildhall. Alderman Richard Charvet suggested the creation of the Guild of World Traders in London.

26 November 1979 Lord Mayor Alderman Sir Peter Gadsden laid foundation stone of International House (part of the then London World Trade Centre complex) and reiterates the suggestion of the creation of the Guild of World Traders.

24 October 1985 Foundation of the Guild of World Traders in London.

15 June 1993 Grant by the Court of Aldermen to become The Company of World Traders.

9 November 1999 Petition to become The Worshipful Company of World Traders agreed by the Court of Aldermen, with effect from 1 January 2000.

25 January 2000 Company received its letters patent in a ceremony at Mansion House, from the Lord Mayor, Alderman Clive Martin.

10 July 2013 Queen Elizabeth II granted a Royal Charter to the Company. The World Traders Company has company number RC000872 (RC denoting Royal Charter).
==Arms, Crest and Motto==
The Arms of the Company were designed by Sir Colin Cole, Garter Principal King of Arms, and presented by him at the Installation ceremony of Alderman Sir Peter Gadsden, the Guild&#x27;s new Master, in 1987. These Arms depict five purses symbolising trade between the five continents, with the sword and wheel of St Catherine together with the water and quayside of the dock, as a reminder of the company&#x27;s foundation. The Arms are surmounted by an escarbuncle containing a medieval merchant&#x27;s cap and the supporters are a dolphin borrowed from the Company of Watermen and Lightermen, who originally gave the company sanctuary in the City of London, and the sea dragon of the City as a mark of respect for its commands.

The Master&#x27;s Badge of office displays the Company&#x27;s coat of arms mounted on a piece of rock crystal, donated by the World Trade Centre of Rio de Janeiro, carved with an outline of five continents.

The motif on the Company tie derives from the Company&#x27;s crest: it comprises the helm, torse and mantling surmounted by the wheel of St. Catherine upon which is a medieval merchant&#x27;s cap.

The Company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Commerce and honest friendship with all&quot;, a quote from Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s inaugural Presidential speech.

<doc id="561934" wikidata="Q547368" url="?curid=561934" title="Bus Stop (1956 film)">
<text>Bus Stop is a 1956 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Joshua Logan for 20th Century Fox, starring Marilyn Monroe, Don Murray, Arthur O&#x27;Connell, Betty Field, Eileen Heckart, Robert Bray, and Hope Lange.

Unlike most of Monroe&#x27;s films, &quot;Bus Stop&quot; is neither a full-fledged comedy nor a musical, but rather a dramatic piece; it was the first film she appeared in after studying at the Actors Studio in New York. Monroe does, however, sing one song: &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot; by Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer.

&quot;Bus Stop&quot; is based on the 1955 play of the same name (which in turn was expanded from an earlier, one-act play titled &quot;People in the Wind&quot;) by William Inge. The inspiration for the play came from people Inge met in Tonganoxie, Kansas.

==Plot==
A naive, unintelligent, socially inept, loud-mouth cowboy, Beauregard &quot;Bo&quot; Decker, and his friend and father-figure Virgil Blessing take the bus from Timber Hill, Montana, to Phoenix, Arizona, to participate in a rodeo. Virgil has encouraged the 21-year-old virgin Bo to take an interest in women. Initially reluctant and frightened of the idea, Beau declares that he hopes to find an &quot;angel&quot; and will know her when he sees her. Making trouble everywhere they go, he continues his unsophisticated behavior in Grace&#x27;s Diner. In Phoenix, at the Blue Dragon Café, he imagines himself in love with the café&#x27;s chanteuse, Chérie, an ambitious performer from the Ozarks with aspirations of becoming a Hollywood star. Her rendition of &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot; entrances him and he forces her outside, despite the establishment&#x27;s rules against it, kisses her and thinks that means they are engaged. Chérie is physically attracted to him but resists his plans to take her back to Montana. She has no intention of marrying him and tells him so, but he is too stubborn to listen.

The next day, Bo obtains a marriage license, and then takes an exhausted Chérie to the rodeo parade and the rodeo, where he rides the bucking bronco and then competes in the calf-roping and the bull-riding. Bo intends to marry Chérie at the rodeo, but she runs away. He tracks her down at the Blue Dragon Café, where she jumps out a rear window and flees. Bo catches her and forces her onto the bus back to Montana. On the way, they stop at Grace&#x27;s Diner, the same place the bus stopped on the way to Phoenix. Chérie tries to make another getaway while Bo is asleep on the bus, but the road ahead is blocked by a blizzard, leaving the passengers stranded in the diner. The bus driver, Carl, the waitress, Elma, and the café owner, Grace, by now all have learned that Bo is kidnapping and bullying Chérie. Virgil and Carl fight him until he promises to apologize to Chérie and leave her alone. He, however, is unable to do so because he is humiliated about having been beaten.

The next morning, the storm has cleared and everybody is free to go. Bo finally apologizes to Chérie for his abusive behavior and begs her forgiveness. He wishes her well and prepares to depart without her. Chérie approaches him and confesses that she has had many boyfriends and is not the kind of woman he thinks she is. Bo confesses his lack of experience to her. Bo asks to kiss her goodbye and they share their first real kiss. All Chérie wanted from a man was respect, which she had previously told Elma when they sat together on the bus. This new Bo attracts Chérie. He accepts her past and this gesture touches her heart. She tells him that she will go anywhere with him. Virgil decides to stay behind. When Bo tries to coerce him to go with them, Chérie reminds him that he cannot force Virgil to do what he wants. Having finally apparently learned his lesson, Bo offers Chérie his jacket and gallantly helps her onto the bus.

==Cast==

* Marilyn Monroe as Chérie
* Don Murray as Beauregard Decker
* Arthur O&#x27;Connell as Virgil Blessing
* Betty Field as Grace
* Eileen Heckart as Vera
* Robert Bray as Carl
* Hope Lange as Elma Duckworth
* Hans Conried as a &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer
* Casey Adams as a &quot;Life&quot; magazine reporter

==Production==
&quot;Bus Stop&quot; was the first film that Monroe chose to make under a new contract. For the role, she learned an Ozark accent, chose costumes and make-up that lacked the glamour of her earlier films, and provided deliberately mediocre singing and dancing. Joshua Logan, known for his work on Broadway, agreed to direct, despite initially doubting Monroe&#x27;s acting abilities and knowing of her reputation for being difficult. Filming took place in Sun Valley, Idaho, and Phoenix, Arizona, in early 1956, with Monroe &quot;technically in charge&quot; as the head of MMP (Marilyn Monroe Productions, her film production company), occasionally making decisions on cinematography and with Logan adapting to her chronic tardiness and perfectionism.

The experience changed Logan&#x27;s opinion of Monroe, and he later compared her to Charlie Chaplin in her ability to blend comedy and tragedy. According to Don Murray, the director was not perturbed that Monroe was accompanied on the set by her own acting coach, Paula Strasberg of the Actors Studio. Murray later recalled: &quot;Paula was there every day, even on location...Logan worked with it very well. He let her talk to Marilyn. Then he would step in and direct. He was very patient. Very few directors would have put up with it.&quot;

George Axelrod, who wrote the script, later said:

I liked that very much. And I think even William Inge now concedes it is at least as good as the play. Because, given the necessities of the stage, he had to cram it all into that one set, whereas it was a play very susceptible to being opened up. It took Marilyn two years to realise that this was her best performance. Indeed, she did not speak to either Josh Logan or me for a year afterwards, because she felt we&#x27;d cut the picture in favour of the boy. Later she came to realise she was wrong. It suggests to me that actors have a very dim appreciation of what&#x27;s good or what&#x27;s bad about their performances.

==Reception==
&quot;Bus Stop&quot; became a box office success, earning more than $7 million in distributor rentals, and received mainly favorable reviews, with Monroe&#x27;s performance being highly praised. &quot;The Saturday Review of Literature&quot; wrote that Monroe&#x27;s performance &quot;effectively dispels once and for all the notion that she is merely a glamour personality&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the lead performances, as well as O&#x27;Connell, Eckart, Field and Bray.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10.

<text>Kaṇāda (, ), also known as Ulūka, Kashyapa, Kaṇabhaksha, Kaṇabhuj was an ancient Indian natural scientist and philosopher who founded the Vaisheshika school of Indian philosophy that also represents the earliest Indian physics.

Estimated to have lived sometime between 6th century to 2nd century BCE, little is known about his life. His traditional name &quot;Kaṇāda&quot; means &quot;atom eater&quot;, and he is known for developing the foundations of an atomistic approach to physics and philosophy in the Sanskrit text &quot;Vaiśeṣika Sūtra&quot;. His text is also known as &quot;Kaṇāda Sutras&quot;, or &quot;Aphorisms of Kaṇāda&quot;.

The school founded by Kaṇāda explains the creation and existence of the universe by proposing an atomistic theory, applying logic and realism, and is one of the earliest known systematic realist ontology in human history. Kaṇāda suggested that everything can be subdivided, but this subdivision cannot go on forever, and there must be smallest entities (&quot;paramanu&quot;) that cannot be divided, that are eternal, that aggregate in different ways to yield complex substances and bodies with unique identity, a process that involves heat, and this is the basis for all material existence. He used these ideas with the concept of Atman (soul, Self) to develop a non-theistic means to moksha. If viewed from the prism of physics, his ideas imply a clear role for the observer as independent of the system being studied. Kaṇāda&#x27;s ideas were influential on other schools of Hinduism, and over its history became closely associated with the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy.

Kaṇāda&#x27;s system speaks of six properties (padārthas) that are nameable and knowable. He claims that these are sufficient to describe everything in the universe, including observers. These six categories are dravya (substance), guna (quality), karma (action/ motion), samanya (generality/ commonness), visesa (particular), and samavaya (inherence). There are nine classes of substances (dravya), some of which are atomic, some non-atomic, and others that are all-pervasive.

The ideas of Kaṇāda span a wide range of fields, and they influenced not only philosophy, but possibly scholars in other fields such as Charaka who wrote a medical text named &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;.

==Lifetime==
The century in which Kaṇāda lived is unclear and has been a subject of a long debate. In his review of 1961, Riepe states Kaṇāda lived sometime before 300 CE, but convincing evidence to firmly put him in a certain century remains elusive.

The &quot;Vaisheshika Sutras&quot; mention competing schools of Indian philosophy such as Samkhya and Mimamsa, but make no mention of Buddhism, which has led scholars in more recent publications to posit estimates of 6th century BCE. The &quot;Vaisheshika Sutras&quot; manuscript has survived into the modern era in multiple versions and the discovery of newer manuscripts in different parts of India by Thakur in 1957 and Jambuvijayaji in 1961, followed by critical edition studies, suggest that the text attributed to Kaṇāda was systematized and finalized sometime between 200 BCE and the start of the common era, with the possibility that its key doctrines may be much older. Multiple Hindu texts dated to the 1st and 2nd century CE, such as the &quot;Mahavibhas&quot; and &quot;Jnanaprasthana&quot; from the Kushan Empire, quote and comment on Kaṇāda&#x27;s doctrines. His ideas are also mentioned in Buddhist texts attributed to Aśvaghoṣa of the same period.

In Jainism literature, he is referred as &quot;Sad-uluka&quot;, which means &quot;the Uluka who propounded the doctrine of six categories&quot;. His Vaisheshika philosophy similarly appears with alternate names, such as &quot;Aulukya philosophy&quot; derived from the nickname Uluka (literally owl, or grain eater in the night).

Kaṇāda was influential in Indian philosophies appearing in various texts by dictators, philosophers, and more, such as Kashyapa, Uluka, Kananda, Kanabhuk among others.

==Ideas==
Physics is central to Kaṇāda&#x27;s assertion that all that is knowable is based on motion. His ascribing centrality to physics in the understanding of the universe also follows from his invariance principles. For example, he says that the atom must be spherical since it should be the same in all dimensions. He asserts that all substances are composed of four types of atoms, two of which have mass and two are massless.

Kaṇāda presents his work within a larger moral framework by defining Dharma as that which brings about material progress and highest good. He follows this Sutra with another that asserts that the Vedas have gained respect because they teach such Dharma, and something is not Dharma simply because it is in the Vedas.
Kaṇāda and early Vaisheshika scholars focused on the evolution of the universe by law. However, this was not unusual for his times since several major early versions of Hindu philosophies such as Samkhya, Nyaya, Mimamsa along with sub-schools of Yoga and Vedanta, as well as non-Vedic schools such as Jainism and Buddhism, were similarly non-theistic. Kaṇāda was among the sages of India who believed in man&#x27;s potential to understand existence and reach moksha on his own, without God, a notion of ancient Indians summarized by Nietzsche as the belief that &quot;with piety and knowledge of the Veda, nothing is impossible&quot;.

The text states:
* There are nine constituents of realities: four classes of atoms (earth, water, light and air), space (akasha), time (kāla), direction (disha), infinity of souls (Atman), mind (manas).
* Every object of creation is made of atoms (paramāṇu) which in turn connect with each other to form molecules (aṇu). Atoms are eternal, and their combinations constitute the empirical material world.
* Individual souls are eternal and pervade material bodies for a time.
* There are six categories (padārtha) of experience—substance, quality, activity, generality, particularity, and inherence.

Several traits of substances (dravya) are given as colour, taste, smell, touch, number, size, the separate, coupling and uncoupling, priority and posterity, comprehension, pleasure and pain, attraction and revulsion, and wishes.

Thus the idea of the subdivision is carried further to analytical categories as well, which explains its affinity with Nyaya.

===Observations and theories===
In the fifth chapter of Vaisheshika Sutra, Kaṇāda mentions various empirical observations and natural phenomena such as the falling of objects to the ground, rising of fire and heat upwards, the growth of grass upwards, the nature of rainfall and thunderstorms, the flow of liquids, the movement towards a magnet among many others, asks why these things happen, then attempts to integrate his observations with his theories on atoms, molecules, and their interaction. He classifies observed events into two: those caused by volition, and those caused by subject-object conjunctions.

His idea of the observer, that is the subject, being different from objective reality is completely consistent with Vedanta, which speaks of the difference between &quot;Apara&quot; and &quot;Para&quot; knowledge, where &quot;Apara&quot; represents normal associational knowledge whereas &quot;Para&quot; represents deeper subjective knowledge.

===The concept of paramanu (atom)===

Kaṇāda proposes that &quot;paramanu&quot; (atom) is an indestructible particle of matter. The atom is indivisible because it is a state at which no measurement can be attributed. He used invariance arguments to determine properties of the atoms. He also stated that &quot;anu&quot; can have two states—absolute rest and a state of motion.

Kaṇāda postulated four different kinds of atoms: two with mass, and two without. Each substance is supposed to consist of all four kinds of atoms.

Kaṇāda&#x27;s conception of the atom was likely independent from the similar concept among the ancient Greeks, because of the differences between the theories. For example, Kaṇāda suggested that atoms as building blocks differ both qualitatively and quantitatively, while Greeks suggested that atoms differed only quantitatively but not qualitatively.

<text>Bandlimiting refers to a process which reduces the energy of a signal to an acceptably low level outside of a desired frequency range. 

Bandlimiting is an essential part of many applications in signal processing and communications. Examples include controlling interference between radio frequency communications signals, and managing aliasing distortion associated with sampling for digital signal processing.

==Bandlimited signals==
A bandlimited signal is, strictly speaking, a signal with zero energy outside of a defined frequency range. In practice, a signal is considered bandlimited if its energy outside of a frequency range is low enough to be considered negligible in a given application.

A bandlimited signal may be either random (stochastic) or non-random (deterministic).

In general, infinitely many terms are required in a continuous Fourier series representation of a signal, but if a finite number of Fourier series terms can be calculated from that signal, that signal is considered to be band-limited. In mathematic terminology, a bandlimited signal has a Fourier transform or spectral density with bounded support.

==Sampling bandlimited signals==

A bandlimited signal can be fully reconstructed from its samples, provided that the sampling rate exceeds twice the bandwidth of the signal. This minimum sampling rate is called the Nyquist rate associated with the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem.

Real world signals are not strictly bandlimited, and signals of interest typically have unwanted energy outside of the band of interest. Because of this, sampling functions and digital signal processing functions which change sample rates usually require bandlimiting filters to control the amount of aliasing distortion. Bandlimiting filters should be designed carefully to manage other distortions because they alter the signal of interest in both its frequency domain magnitude and phase, and its time domain properties.

An example of a simple deterministic bandlimited signal is a sinusoid of the form formula_1 If this signal is sampled at a rate formula_2 so that we have the samples formula_3 for all integers formula_4, we can recover formula_5 completely from these samples. Similarly, sums of sinusoids with different frequencies and phases are also bandlimited to the highest of their frequencies.

The signal whose Fourier transform is shown in the figure is also bandlimited. Suppose formula_5 is a signal whose Fourier transform is formula_7 the magnitude of which is shown in the figure. The highest frequency component in formula_5 is formula_9 As a result, the Nyquist rate is

:formula_10

or twice the highest frequency component in the signal, as shown in the figure. According to the sampling theorem, it is possible to reconstruct formula_11 completely and exactly using the samples

:formula_12 for all integers formula_13 and formula_14

as long as

:formula_15

The reconstruction of a signal from its samples can be accomplished using the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula.

==Bandlimited versus timelimited==

A bandlimited signal cannot be also timelimited. More precisely, a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have finite support unless it is identically zero. This fact can be proved using complex analysis and properties of the Fourier transform.

Proof: Assume that a signal f(t) which has finite support in both domains and is not identically zero exists. Let&#x27;s sample it faster than the Nyquist frequency, and compute respective Fourier transform formula_16 and discrete-time Fourier transform formula_17. According to properties of DTFT, formula_18, where formula_19 is the frequency used for discretization. If f is bandlimited, formula_20 is zero outside of a certain interval, so with large enough formula_21, formula_22 will be zero in some intervals too, since individual supports of formula_20 in sum of formula_22 won&#x27;t overlap. According to DTFT definition, formula_22 is a sum of trigonometric functions, and since f(t) is time-limited, this sum will be finite, so formula_22 will be actually a trigonometric polynomial. All trigonometric polynomials are holomorphic on a whole complex plane, and there is a simple theorem in complex analysis that says that all zeros of non-constant holomorphic function are isolated. But this contradicts our earlier finding that formula_22 has intervals full of zeros, because points in such intervals are not isolated. Thus the only time- and bandwidth-limited signal is a constant zero.

One important consequence of this result is that it is impossible to generate a truly bandlimited signal in any real-world situation, because a bandlimited signal would require infinite time to transmit. All real-world signals are, by necessity, &quot;timelimited&quot;, which means that they &quot;cannot&quot; be bandlimited. Nevertheless, the concept of a bandlimited signal is a useful idealization for theoretical and analytical purposes. Furthermore, it is possible to approximate a bandlimited signal to any arbitrary level of accuracy desired.

A similar relationship between duration in time and bandwidth in frequency also forms the mathematical basis for the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. In that setting, the &quot;width&quot; of the time domain and frequency domain functions are evaluated with a variance-like measure. Quantitatively, the uncertainty principle imposes the following condition on any real waveform:

:formula_28

where

:formula_29 is a (suitably chosen) measure of bandwidth (in hertz), and

:formula_30 is a (suitably chosen) measure of time duration (in seconds).

In time–frequency analysis, these limits are known as the &quot;Gabor limit,&quot; and are interpreted as a limit on the &quot;simultaneous&quot; time–frequency resolution one may achieve.

<text>Gentle Ben is a bear character created by author Walt Morey and first introduced in a 1965 children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Gentle Ben&quot;. The original novel told the story of the friendship between a large male bear named Ben and a boy named Mark. The story provided the basis for the 1967 film &quot;Gentle Giant&quot;, the popular late 1960s U.S. television series &quot;Gentle Ben&quot;, a 1980s animated cartoon and two early 2000s made-for-TV movies.

==1965 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Gentle Ben&quot;==

Walt Morey, a filbert farmer and former boxer, had previously written many pulp fiction stories for adults dealing with subjects such as boxing, the Old West, and outdoor adventures, published in magazines such as &quot;Argosy&quot;. However, due to the decline in demand for pulp fiction caused by the advent of broadcast television in the 1950s, Morey stopped writing for ten years. His wife, a schoolteacher, challenged him to write adventure stories that would interest young readers, similar to those of Jack London. After several years, Morey took up her challenge with the goal of producing an adventure story for young readers that adults could also enjoy.

The result was &quot;Gentle Ben&quot;, which was based on Morey&#x27;s own past experiences working and traveling in Alaska. Morey said that many of the book characters were based on real Alaskan people he had met. According to Morey, the concept of a boy&#x27;s friendship with an Alaskan brown bear was also taken from real life, and such friendships and interactions between humans and bears were not unusual in Alaska.

Originally published in 1965 by E.P. Dutton, the novel was a success, selling nearly 3 million copies. As an unpublished draft it won the Dutton Animal Book Award resulting in its publication. Morey won the Dutton prize a second time in 1968 for &quot;Kävik the Wolf Dog&quot;. Morey went on to write many more children&#x27;s novels, often involving themes of nature, animals and survival, but is best known for &quot;Gentle Ben&quot;.

=== Synopsis of the novel ===
Mark Andersen is a young teenage boy who lives in Alaska with his fisherman father and mother, Karl and Ellen Andersen. Mark is lonely after the death of his older brother, and befriends an Alaskan brown bear named Ben that was captured as a cub by local drunkard Fog Benson. Ben, now a large adult bear, spends his days chained alone in a shack on Benson&#x27;s property, and the lonely bear bonds with the lonely boy who secretly visits him. Mark&#x27;s parents are initially upset that he visits Ben, but eventually see that Mark and Ben have a special friendship and buy Ben from Fog Benson for Mark, on the condition that Mark help his father with the fishing to pay him back.

However, Fog Benson and his friends attack Ben and Ben fights back, injuring Fog. The townspeople, who generally regard brown bears as wild and unpredictable, now think that Ben is dangerous, and Mark is forced to abandon Ben on an island, where Ben is still menaced by Fog Benson and hunters. Soon afterwards, Karl&#x27;s fishing boat is destroyed in a storm, so he takes a job minding a fish trap on the island where Ben is living, which leads to Mark and Ben&#x27;s renewing their friendship. Then Ben helps a wealthy businessman and trophy hunter visiting the island, Peter King, who is trapped under a rock. Ben gently rolls the rock off him. The grateful King pays a local guide to protect Ben and ends up going into business with Karl Andersen, so Ben will be safe and the Andersens&#x27; financial fortunes are greatly improved.

=== Memorial statue ===
An tall (life size) carved wooden statue of Gentle Ben the bear stands in Walt Morey Park in Wilsonville, Oregon, a bear-themed park created on land that previously belonged to the Morey family. In 2012, the Gentle Ben statue was stolen from the park by local teens and dumped in a roadside ditch. It was later found and returned to the park.

==1960s television series &quot;Gentle Ben&quot;==

The CBS television series &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; premiered September 10, 1967, and ran until August 31, 1969, airing a total of 58 episodes in two seasons. The series chronicled the adventures of young Mark Wedloe (played by Clint Howard) and his lovable black bear named Ben.

&quot;Gentle Ben&quot; was produced by Ivan Tors, who also produced the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; pilot film. Tors was an established producer of successful TV series, including &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, &quot;Flipper&quot; and &quot;Daktari&quot;. Like the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; film, the TV series &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; was set in Florida (allowing Tors to use his own studio facilities there) rather than Alaska, and Ben was a large black bear instead of the brown bear of the original novel. The TV series picked up the story where &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; left off, with Mark&#x27;s father Tom Wedloe already a wildlife officer in the Everglades, and Ben an adult bear and established family pet living outside (or sometimes inside) the Wedloes&#x27; house.

=== Cast of the TV series ===

The TV series had few regular characters, consisting of the Wedloe family and their friend and neighbor Henry Boomhauer. Clint Howard and Dennis Weaver continued their roles from the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; film. The role of Ellen Wedloe, played in &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; by Vera Miles, was recast for the TV series with Beth Brickell. The Boomhauer character appeared in several of the episodes and was played by Clint&#x27;s real-life father Rance Howard (who also wrote episodes for the show).

Other recurring characters included Hank Minegar, a squatter played by Robertson White (who had a different small role in &quot;Gentle Giant&quot;) and Willie, a friend of Mark&#x27;s, played by Angelo Rutherford.

Although several black bears were used to play Ben, depending on what behavior was required for a particular scene, the role was played primarily by Bruno the Bear (who also played adult Ben in the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; film).

Musician and voice actor Candy Candido provided the voice of Ben. Although the network wanted to have Ben speak like a human on the show, Tors disliked the idea, so Ben made only animal noises.

Notable guest stars included Burt Reynolds, Jay Silverheels, Strother Martin, Slim Pickens, Victor French, and Clint Howard&#x27;s brother Ron Howard.

===Bears in the TV series===
Ralph Helfer&#x27;s Africa U.S.A. animal ranch provided Bruno and other bears (as well as other animals) used in the series. The bears were obtained from Canada or near the Canada–U.S. border because those bears&#x27; coats were thicker and more photogenic than those of bears located further south in the U.S. The bears were declawed and had most of their teeth removed. Helfer stated that four bears were used to portray Ben, with other sources naming or listing additional bears, who may have been used in particular scenes or as stand-in bears. Some episodes and sequences also involved bear cubs or other bear characters that may have required additional bears.

Bruno was the favorite bear actor because of his good disposition, broad range of behaviors, facial expressions, and ability to work with children. A bear named Buck, who closely resembled Bruno but was a slightly smaller, younger and more agile bear, was used for scenes requiring the bear to run. According to Clint Howard, Bruno the bear and Buck the bear together did approximately 75 percent of the bear acting work.

A bear named Drum frequently appeared in scenes requiring the bear to enter water. Drum&#x27;s coat was brown and had to be spray-painted to match the black coats of the other bears playing Ben. In the 1980s, Dennis Weaver recalled that a bear named Hammer, who occasionally misbehaved on the set, was used for bear scenes involving water. Other bears reportedly used included Smokey, Oscar, Baron, Tudor, Virgil, and a bear (identity unknown, possibly Hammer) with a tendency to fight who was used for bear fight scenes. Bear trainer Tuffy Truesdell, who owned nine bears including the elder and younger Victor the Wrestling Bear, also claimed that his bears did &quot;most of the stand-in work&quot; for the TV series.

According to most sources, the primary bear trainers and bear handlers who did most of the day-to-day bear work on the series were head bear trainer Monty Cox (who said that he was hired after &quot;Ben&quot; had &quot;chewed up&quot; a previous bear trainer), and Vern Debord. Other animal trainers involved in the series included Ron Oxley and Steve Martin. Derrick Rosaire Sr. and Pat Derby have also claimed involvement, although it is not clear whether they worked on the TV series or just on the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; pilot film. Bruno and some of the other bears were trained using &quot;affection training&quot;, which stressed establishing a respectful bond between animal and trainer, rather than using punishment or food rewards. However, food rewards were used to motivate at least one bear who responded better to that method. Bruno reportedly lived with Cox in a Miami apartment, sometimes even following him into the shower and sleeping in his bed.

During and after the run of the TV series, the name &quot;Ben&quot; or &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; was used to refer to a number of bears who had appeared in the show. Bruno&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Ben&quot; while he was appearing in the series; it was changed back to &quot;Bruno&quot; after the show ended. Oxley and Martin made personal appearances at fairs and events with a bear (often Drum) billed as &quot;Gentle Ben.&quot; In the late 1960s and 1970s, Rosaire Sr. appeared with the Emmett Kelly Circus and elsewhere with a trained bear he called &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; that purportedly played the role. Rosaire Sr., his son and grandson have said over the years that this bear was a female bear who played both Ben&#x27;s mother and Ben in the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; film. (Ben&#x27;s mother never appears in the TV series as she is killed at the beginning of the film, and the TV series takes place after the events of the film.)

Tuffy Truesdell also trained a wrestling brown bear known as &quot;Gentleman Ben&quot; and occasionally called &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; or &quot;Ben&quot;, who wrestled in at least 80 matches for various promotions in the late 1960s and 1970s. Although Truesdell claimed that his bears did work on the TV series, there is no evidence linking the particular bear he called &quot;Gentleman Ben&quot; to the TV show, particularly since the show used black bears rather than brown bears.

After the &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; series ended, Bruno moved back to California with trainer Ron Oxley and continued his acting career, making a well-received appearance in the 1972 film &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; with Paul Newman. Bruno reportedly died in 1980 or 1981. Buck entertained visitors for many years at the Homosassa Springs Attraction in Florida (now part of Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park). Hammer retired from acting in 1969 and became the first black bear at the Dreher Park Zoo (later renamed the Palm Beach Zoo) in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he lived for almost 20 years. Derrick Rosaire Sr. continued to exhibit his bear named &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; throughout the 1970s. The fate of the other bear actors involved in &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; and the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; pilot film is not currently known.

Although the bear character in a subsequent television series, &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot;, was also named &quot;Ben&quot;, that character was played by a grizzly bear rather than a black bear, and the show, character and bear actor had no connection to &quot;Gentle Ben,&quot; except for trainer Steve Martin supplying some animals (including a &quot;backup&quot; grizzly named Grizz) to the &quot;Grizzly Adams&quot; show.

===Production===
&quot;Gentle Ben&quot; was filmed in Florida at the Ivan Tors Studios (now Greenwich Studios) in North Miami and at various locations in the surrounding area, including Homosassa Springs and Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden. The bears, who were from the northern United States or Canada and thus used to colder temperatures, had trouble adjusting to the warm climate. Following a severe flood that caused major damage to Africa U.S.A. in January 1969, the bears working on the show were relocated permanently to Homosassa Springs, where the Ivan Tors Animal Actor Training School was then operating.

Writers for the series included Roswell Rogers, Earl Hamner, Jr., Tam Spiva, Rance Howard, Gilbert Ralston, and Frank Telford. Many of the plots focused on themes relating to Tom Wedloe&#x27;s work as a wildlife officer, such as animal management, lost children, disasters such as hurricanes or fires, and poaching or other illegal activities taking place in Wedloe&#x27;s jurisdiction. In addition to Ben, other animals were frequently featured. A recurring plot device involved a stranger encountering Ben for the first time and being terrified, until Mark explained that Ben was not dangerous.

In the series, Tom Wedloe often traveled the Everglades via airboat and Jeep, while Henry Boomhauer drove a swamp buggy. The airboat, with the characters of Tom, Mark, Ellen, and Ben the bear riding it, was prominently featured in the show&#x27;s opening credits. Dennis Weaver later recounted an incident where one of the bear actors, Hammer, capsized the airboat.

According to trainer Monty Cox, Ivan Tors once expressed concern that when Bruno the bear walked away from the camera, his testicles were visible in some shots, and asked if Cox could somehow tape them up so they would be out of camera view. Cox refused.

Several people involved with the series, including Cox, have confirmed that the bears used in the production were sometimes ill-tempered or did not behave as expected, and that working with them could be dangerous. On one occasion, Bruno the bear sat on Clint Howard. According to Dennis Weaver, during the run of the show, the cast and crew were forbidden to publicly mention any incidents of bear misbehavior. However, Clint Howard has stated that he never suffered any injuries from the bears on the show, and that his only injury came from working with a raccoon that had not been declawed.

=== Reception ===

&quot;Gentle Ben&quot; was a hit, reaching a position of #2 in the Nielsen ratings during its first season. A number of TV tie-in products were marketed, including children&#x27;s books (by authors other than Walt Morey), a board game and a pull-string talking &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; plush bear by Mattel, a lunchbox, and an album of songs sung by the cast members entitled &quot;The Stars of &quot;Gentle Ben&quot;: The Bear Facts.&quot; Dell Comics produced a &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; comic book, featuring photo covers of the TV show actors, that ran for five issues in 1968.

However, in its second season, &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; failed to consistently make the top 20 and was cancelled. Its decline in popularity has been attributed to its young target audience growing older and losing interest in animal shows, and also to its timeslot forcing it to compete with &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; for its target audience. A letter-writing campaign to save the show (even read into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;) resulted in 2600 letters being sent to the network, but was not successful.

In spite of its short lifespan and cancellation, the show continued to run regularly in syndication, including outside the United States. Personal appearances by &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; at circuses and events continued to be popular into the 1970s. In October 1969, after the cancellation of the show, &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; the bear even received a personalized invitation from Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. to a celebrity party in Fort Lauderdale.

=== Controversy over portrayal of bears ===

Although the show was praised for promoting respect for nature and family values, it also drew criticism for its unrealistic portrayal of a wild bear&#x27;s interaction with humans. Some critics noted that the show premiered only a few weeks after the well-publicized Glacier National Park, Montana fatal grizzly bear attacks of August 13, 1967, when two female campers were killed by grizzly bears, in separate incidents and locations, on the same night. When the show debuted, PTA Magazine complained that &quot;[f]or years, there have been warnings to children and adults against feeding and playing with bears...How CBS could permit a program with a black bear for a pet—not a cub either—but a gigantic adult bear—is beyond our comprehension.&quot;

In 1971, John Hast, the chief National Park Service officer, stated that &quot;[t]he television series &#x27;Gentle Ben&#x27; was the worst thing that ever happened to us. People saw this big lovable bear on television and when they see a bear in the park I guess they think it&#x27;s the same one. They don&#x27;t realize how wrong they are until they&#x27;re bleeding.&quot;

Sweden also refused to broadcast the show due to concerns that children would be influenced to play and interact with the wild bears indigenous to that country.

==Home media==
On October 15, 2013, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) released season 1 on DVD in Region 1. The second and final season was released on February 18, 2014.

== 1981 animated cartoon &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; ==
In 1981, a short-lived animated cartoon called &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; was released in syndication by the Gentle Ben Animation Co. The main character, Gentle Ben the bear, was portrayed as a crime-fighting superhero who wore a cape.

==2000s TV films==
In the early 2000s, two TV film remakes of the original series were sponsored by the Animal Planet cable channel in association with Hallmark Entertainment. In both remakes, &quot;Ben&quot; was played by Bonkers, a 6-foot-tall, 650 pound male American black bear trained by Ruth La Barge.

&quot;Gentle Ben&quot; (also known as &quot;Gentle Ben: The Movie&quot; and &quot;Gentle Ben: Terror on the Mountain&quot;) was first shown on 25 March 2002, although some cable airings list it with a 2003 date.

&quot;Gentle Ben 2&quot; (also known as &quot;Gentle Ben: Danger on the Mountain&quot;) was first shown on 5 January 2003. It was known as &quot;Gentle Ben: Black Gold&quot; for its UK release.

==In popular culture==
* Since the 1960s, &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; has been widely used by many writers as a humorous name when referring to a bear.
* &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; has also been used as a nickname for various public figures, including American professional golfer Ben Crenshaw and Australian cricketer Ben Hilfenhaus.
* The &quot;Homer Badman&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; animated cartoon (Season 6, episode 9, originally broadcast on November 27, 1994) included a parody of a TV talk show called &quot;Ben&quot;, hosted by a bear named &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; with a microphone strapped to his head. &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; responds to audience members&#x27; comments and questions with growls, then gets distracted by a backstage buffet, runs amok and starts to eat, at which point he is surrounded and shot by marksmen wearing jackets labeled &quot;Ben Control&quot; and the TV screen cuts briefly to a test pattern, then an interstitial card. The sequence has been mentioned in several compilations of funniest moments from the long-running show. A parody of the character is portrayed as &quot;genteel Ben&quot; in season 17 episode 12, &quot;My Fair Laddy&quot;.
* In the &quot;Rangeboy&quot; episode of &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; children&#x27;s television series (Season 1, episode 4, originally broadcast on December 19, 1993), Big Pete refers to a (probably) fictional Gentle Ben episode, where Ben saves a blind kid from a mineshaft. He refers to Ben as a positive character in order to persuade his father to wear a bear costume while he is occupied as a rangeboy at his father&#x27;s golf club.

<doc id="561955" wikidata="Q711948" url="?curid=561955" title="Marine Boy">
<text>Marine Boy was one of the first color anime to be shown in a dubbed form in the U.S., and later in Australia and the United Kingdom. It was originally produced in 1965 in Japan as by Minoru Adachi and animation company Japan Tele-Cartoons. It was sold outside Japan via K. Fujita Associates Inc., with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Television handling worldwide distribution of the English-language version. The series was distributed in syndication in the United States starting in 1966.

==Series==

The show revolves around a talented boy who is further enhanced by some sophisticated inventions. With these, he serves with the underwater policing agency, the Ocean Patrol, in making Earth&#x27;s oceans safe.

The series is set in the future, when humankind has explored the world&#x27;s oceans, establishing great facilities for undersea ranching (episode 4, 17, 22), mineral and oil exploitation (ep. 2, 12), research (ep. 6, 7), and some underocean communities (ep. 10, 15).

In this era there is an ocean-based government agency: The Ocean Patrol, whose mission includes protecting all in the sea from danger (episode 4). Most of the activity we witness of the OP is that of policing the world&#x27;s oceans, for this affluent frontier and its resources seems to have produced a startling number of megalomaniacs—it seems hardly a week goes by in which the Ocean Patrol doesn&#x27;t divert someone with an impressive private military force from taking over the world. That being the case, the Ocean Patrol is also an impressive military force with small and large subs, war ships, and an air force (ep. 5, 18). The military branch of the OP includes researchers and scientists who are constantly developing their defensive and offensive arsenal (ep. 9, 10, 17, 19) as well as new research vehicles (ep. 10, 12) and devices (ep. 13). Key people in this department are Marine Boy&#x27;s father, Dr. Mariner, as well as the brilliant Professor Fumble. However, there are non-military branches of the Ocean Patrol which conduct some of the aforementioned ranching, research, oil drilling and so on.

The series follows the Ocean Patrol&#x27;s patrol boat P-1. The patrol boats are small submarine craft, comfortably sized to be crewed by 3 or 4 people. They are also capable of flight for limited times using retractable wings (episode 4, 27). Patrol boats may be heavily armed, most commonly with small &quot;rocket torpedoes,&quot; but optional weaponry is sometimes mounted. These have included a heat beam, boxing glove missiles (ep. 4), smoke screen (ep. 4, 14), a heavy saw, sonic cannon (ep. 9), a steel net (ep. 11), power claws, drill and laser beam guns (ep. 28). The crew of the P-1 includes Bolton and Piper (a double act, reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy) and often the Ocean Patrol member Marine Boy.

Marine Boy is an extremely intelligent, strong and athletic boy of perhaps 13 to 15 years of age. He is a martial artist (episode 1, 2, 8, 16), football player (ep. 17), and an accomplished pilot (ep. 10) whose talents are further enhanced by the inventions of his father, Dr. Mariner. He has a great affinity with sea life, most particularly with a white dolphin he calls Splasher who Marine Boy occasionally seems able to communicate with quite clearly (ep. 11, 12, 17, 28). (MB also wears a ring with a dolphin-calling whistle in it (ep. 2, 4, 16).) It is perhaps because of his skills along with his avid insistence to get involved with trouble that his father, along with Professor Fumble, invented for him the red wetsuit which protects and equips Marine Boy, allowing for him to use his talents to perform dangerous duty. With his headstrong personality, he hardly seems able to avoid it.

The suit is highly resistant to penetration (ep. 1, 2) (it appears it may be bulletproof) and temperature (ep. 17, 21). The boots have hyper-powered propeller packs built into the heels which are so efficient they can enable Marine Boy to move huge boulders (ep. 3) and break free from metal manacles (ep. 10). When the power units are exhausted Marine Boy has spares in his belt. He also has retractable flippers, released at the click of his heels (ep. 3). The headgear includes a radio transceiver, but most remarkably, there is no breathing apparatus or face shield. Oxygen is supplied through another of Professor Fumble&#x27;s inventions: &quot;oxy-gum&quot; which Marine Boy can chew and receive hours of oxygenation. He tends to have to replenish the gum after heavy activity. Presumably the oxy-gum is very limited in production because no other Ocean Patrol officers use it. Marine Boy also carries a weapon: a boomerang made of a hardened alloy. The alloy can cut through many materials and the nimble Marine Boy has even used it to deflect bullets (ep. 24). It folds on a spring so it can be carried in a holster on his left arm. When unfolded and thrown it can generate a powerful electric shock, which has proved to be so disruptive to some electrical systems, it has blown up entire submarines (ep. 14, 16, 28).

Marine Boy also has a friend in Neptina, a young bare-chested mermaid who was always kept decent by her long flowing hair. Neptina wears a magic pearl around her neck, which could be used for various purposes including creating an envelope of protection and deterring dangerous animals (episode 1, 2, 17), as well as working as a crystal ball to see events (ep. 3, 6, 13, 15, 16, 17). She also seems to understand Splasher (ep. 3, 6, 10) and have an innate understanding of sea life (ep. 4). During battle Marine Boy always directs her to safely stay out of harm&#x27;s way, and Neptina always submits, then almost inevitably ends up saving Marine Boy. However, in spite of all his gadgets, Marine Boy is knocked out several times by the villains. Marine Boy often faints after being attacked with knock-out gas but Marine Boy is also knocked unconscious by robot spiders, red dolphins and mysterious seaweed, to name but a few. He is also frequently kidnapped by the villains but usually rescued by his friends.

== History ==

The program concept was developed by &quot;Terebi Doga&quot;, (a.k.a. Japan Tele-Cartoons or JTC), in Japan in 1965, originally known as . Produced as a short experimental trial series of only three episodes and filmed in black and white, &quot;Dolphin Prince&quot; aired on Fuji TV on Sundays at 7:30 pm between 4 April and 18 April 1965. The episodes featured young Dolphin Prince, his mermaid friend Neptuna and Dr. Mariner, with stories entitled &quot;Secret Of The Red Vortex&quot;, &quot;Call Of The Sea&quot; and &quot;Attack Of The Sea-Star People&quot;. It was a well-received experiment and Terebi Doga prepared to produce a full series follow-up, although this time they decided that their program would be produced in color in order to maximise the potential of the production, both artistically and commercially.

Japan had been transmitting some programs in color since 1960, however, not all Japanese studios had converted their operations to color. To complicate matters, not all Japanese networks were interested in buying expensive color film series which were considered vehicles for selling commercial airtime, especially programs aimed primarily at children. Some broadcasters (such as NHK, TBS, NET and Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation) had embraced color as the emerging and more engaging format, but others such as Fuji TV were unwilling to buy or co-finance color programming without a guarantee of commercial return or sponsored support. Fuji TV had broadcast the popular color series &quot;Jungle Emperor&quot; in 1965, but this would not have been filmed in color at all without the pre-sale of the series to U.S. distributor NBC Films for broadcast in the United States as &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot; (on the NBC Network which, at the time, insisted that it be supplied color programming by its distributors, the network using color as a promotional tool to attract both sponsors and viewers alike).

&quot;Terebi Doga&quot;, wishing to further explore their &quot;Dolphin Prince&quot; concept via a full color version, returned to Fuji TV, expecting that the network would happily buy an expanded version of their original monochrome pilot series. Fuji, however, declined to buy into the project, happy as they were with the ratings they were achieving with their current Thursday night black and white anime series &quot;Harris&#x27; Whirlwind&quot;. Undeterred, &quot;Terebi Doga&quot; found external sponsorship from the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company (later to be known as Panasonic), and sold their new version of &quot;Dolphin Prince&quot; to rival TBS Network. Character names were altered, (changing &#x27;Dolphin Prince&#x27; to &#x27;Marine Kid&#x27; and &#x27;Neptuna&#x27; to &#x27;Neptina&#x27;), characters were added and concepts expanded. In order to distance the new series from the original trial episodes, the series was re-titled and aired on Thursdays at 7:00 pm between 6 October and 29 December 1966. Despite Toei Doga&#x27;s high hopes, the scheduling of &quot;Hang On! Marine Kid&quot; was a ratings disaster for TBS, slotted as it was directly in opposition to the ever-popular &quot;Harris&#x27; Whirlwind&quot;, which was still airing on Fuji TV at 7:00 pm. &quot;Hang On! Marine Kid&quot; was cancelled after its first batch of 13 episodes and not renewed.

Despite its cancellation, &quot;Hang On! Marine Kid&quot; was promoted for sale by Japanese program seller K. Fujita, who in turn attracted the attention of producer Stanley R. Jaffe representing U.S. distributor Seven Arts Television, which later merged into Warner Bros./Seven Arts. Jaffe expressed interest in re-packaging the existing series and expanding it with newly animated episodes for the English-speaking market, with two provisions. First, the series needed to run for 78 episodes to ensure the program had substantial shelf-life and value for money for stations buying it. Second, it was stipulated that the Japanese-language version could not be aired in Japan before the English-language version had aired first-run in the U.S. and sold to international broadcasters. With the deal agreed to, &quot;Terebi Doga&quot; launched production again, preparing the elements of both &quot;Dolphin Prince&quot;, (the three monochrome episodes re-worked and re-shot in color), and the 13 completed episodes of &quot;Hang On! Marine Kid&quot; for use in the new series, as well as gearing up to producing 62 more new episodes as required to produce the complete 78-episode run. Scripts and storyboards were prepared in both English and Japanese and with a fast turnaround in the production process, the episodes were delivered to Zavala-Riss Productions in the U.S. for English dubbing (the unit that also dubbed &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, featuring the same voice actor cast).

By the end of production, two distinct versions had been produced:
- one for the U.S. and foreign markets which would be known as &quot;Marine Boy&quot;
- one for Japan as .

As per the terms of the agreement, &quot;Marine Boy&quot; was first run as a syndicated program throughout the U.S. and in international markets from late 1967 onwards. The Japanese version of the series was eventually sold to Fuji TV and aired on Mondays at 6 pm between 31 January 1969 and 22 September 1969, with only the first 36 episodes broadcast. It was later bought by Nippon TV, all 78 episodes airing Monday to Friday at 5:00 pm between 11 May to 2 September 1971.

== English characterization ==
The voice of Marine Boy, Neptina and Clicli was that of Corinne Orr, who was also the voice of Trixie and Spritle in &quot;Speed Racer&quot;. Jack Grimes, who also worked on &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, was the voice of Professor Fumble and Splasher. Peter Fernandez was the voice of Piper and Dr. Mariner. His other work includes &quot;The Space Giants&quot;, &quot;Ultraman&quot;, &quot;Star Blazers&quot;, many of the Godzilla films, as well as both Speed and Racer X from &quot;Speed Racer&quot;. Jack Curtis was the voice of Bullton, as well as the series&#x27; narrator (performing the same duties on &quot;Speed Racer&quot;).

<doc id="561962" wikidata="Q7899288" url="?curid=561962" title="Upsilon Pi Epsilon">
<text>Upsilon Pi Epsilon () is the first honor society dedicated to the computing and information disciplines. Informally known as UPE, Upsilon Pi Epsilon was founded in 1967, at Texas A&amp;M University. It has more than 300 chapters worldwide. 

== About ==
Upsilon Pi Epsilon was established at Texas A&amp;M University in January 1967 as an honor society for computer information. It was founded with 22 original members. Dr. Dan Drew, head of the university&#x27;s Department of Computer Science, was the society&#x27;s advisor and, later, its national president. 

The purpose of Upsilon Pi Epsilon was &quot;the promotion of high scholarship and original investigation in the field of computer science and the advancement of the art and profession of computer science and related endeavors.&quot; It al recognized talent and sought to maintain high standards in the field. It was the first society developed for computer science in the United States.

A second chapter, &quot;Alpha of Pennsylvania&quot;, was formed at Pennsylvania State University in December 1969. The group expanded to other colleges in the United States and abroad, becoming the first international honor society for the computer and information disciplines.

Upsilon Pi Epsilon became a member of the Association of College Honor Societies in 1997. Upsilon Pi Epsilon is endorsed by the Association for Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society (IEEE-CS). It was also a founding member of the International Federation of Engineering Education Societies.

In 2012, Upsilon Pi Epsilon had 247 active collegiate chapters and 235 active alumni chapters. That same year, its annual initiations totaled 2,138 and its total membership was 229,800.

== Symbols ==
The Greek name Upsilon Pi Epsilon was selected for the first letters of the Greek words for computer, information, and science.

The UPE emblem or key features three symbols that are important historically to the computing and information disciplines: the zero, the one, and the abacus. The numbers are arranged as eleven binary bits. During the society&#x27;s initiation ceremony, inductees sit in front of a table that features nine lit candles and two unlit candles that are arranged as the eleven binary bits of its key.

The colors of Upsilon Pi Epsilon are maroon and white. Its symbol is the abacus. Its quarterly publication is the &quot;UPE NewsBrief&quot;.

== Activities ==
Upsilon Pi Epsilon holds an annual convention. The society gives out several scholarships for its members and those who are active student members. It also cosponsores the International Collegiate Programming Contest with the Association of Computing Machinery. 

== Membership ==
Membership is available to undergraduate and graduate students in computer science who have a high grade point average. Eligible undergraduates must complete 48 credits, rank in the upper third of their class, and have a 3.25 GPA overall. Graduate students must have completed 15 units of graduate coursework in computing and must be in the top third of their class. Alumni who majored in computer science can also be offered membership into the fraternity, along with faculty members. Faculty must have taught in field for one year. Membership in UPE is lifetime.

== Chapters ==
Upsilon Pi Epsilon has more than 300 chapters in the United States and overseas.

<doc id="561979" wikidata="Q195175" url="?curid=561979" title="Shag Rocks (South Georgia)">
<text>The Shag Rocks () are six small islets, as opposed to islands, in the westernmost extreme of South Georgia, west of the main island of South Georgia and off the Falkland Islands. The Shag Rocks are located at . further southeast is Black Rock, which is located at .

The Shag Rocks cover a total area of less than . Situated on the South Georgia Ridge, they have a peak elevation above sea level of , and stand in water approximately deep. Temperatures average , rarely climbing above . There is no significant vegetation, but the rocks are covered by the guano of seabirds. The main wildlife found on the rocks are the South Georgia shags, prions and wandering albatrosses.

== History ==
The Shag Rocks were discovered by Jose de la Llana in 1762 with the Spanish ship &quot;Aurora&quot;, and originally named the Aurora Islands, after his ship. They were visited by the Spanish ship &quot;San Miguel&quot; in 1769, again by the &quot;Aurora&quot; in 1774, and in 1779 by the Spanish ships &quot;Princesa&quot; and &quot;Dolores&quot;. In 1794 the Auroras were finally mapped by the Spanish corvette &quot;Atrevida&quot;. However, the Aurora Islands are considered by many to have been a mistaken sighting that was coincidentally near the Shag Rocks, which were known to sealers prior to 1823. They were later rediscovered by James P. Sheffield and given their current name, probably because shags and other seabirds frequent them. They were charted by Discovery Investigations personnel on the &quot;William Scoresby&quot; in 1927. The first known landing was made in 1956 when Argentine geologist Mario Giovinetto was lowered from a helicopter to collect rock samples.

== Government ==
The Shag Rocks form part of the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Before 1985 they came within the Falkland Islands Dependencies.

Argentina lays claim to the Shag Rocks and Black Rock. Black Rock and Shag Rocks are on the route from the Falkland Islands to South Georgia Island, on a seamount of Scotia Ridge.

Britain in 1985 formed its overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which includes Black Rock and Shag Rocks. It now assumes responsibility for preservation and defence of the area.

<text>North East Fife was one of three local government districts in the Fife region of Scotland from 1975 to 1996.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across mainland Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. North East Fife was one of three districts created within the region of Fife, along with Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy. The district covered the whole area of 15 former districts from the historic county of Fife, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Auchtermuchty Burgh

In 1996 Scotland&#x27;s districts and regions were abolished under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. Fife became a single unitary council area, headquartered in Glenrothes as the regional council had also been.

The area is still covered by the North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency).

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:

===District result maps===
==Premises==
The council was based at County Buildings on St Catherine Street in Cupar. The building had been built in 1817 as the county&#x27;s sheriff court and meeting place for the Commissioners of Supply which preceded the county council. It had then served as the headquarters of Fife County Council between 1890 and 1975, with a large extension to the east being added in 1925.

<doc id="561995" wikidata="Q7868462" url="?curid=561995" title="USS Columbia (CL-56)">
<text>USS &quot;Columbia&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

The ship, the sixth US Navy ship to bear the name, was named for the city of Columbia, South Carolina. &quot;Columbia&quot; was commissioned in July 1942, and saw service in several campaigns in the Pacific. Like almost all her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, and never saw active service again. &quot;Columbia&quot; was scrapped in the early 1960s. A memorial to the ship and crew who served on her exists in Columbia.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Columbia&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of eight Bofors guns in two quadruple mounts and thirteen Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Columbia&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;Columbia&quot; was laid down on 19 August 1940 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. She was launched on 17 December 1941, ten days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II. &quot;Columbia&quot; was moved to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before she was commissioned into the fleet on 29 June 1942. After completing fitting-out work, the ship got underway for initial training on 14 September, which was carried out off Hampton Roads, Virginia, and included weapons familiarization practice and aircraft operations. &quot;Columbia&quot; then sailed for the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs and alterations and then embarked on her shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay, which lasted from 16 October to 8 November The next day, she got underway and joined Task Group (TG) 2.6, which also included the fast battleship and the destroyers , , and . The ships sailed south and arrived in Panama on 13 November.

&quot;Columbia&quot; and the rest of the ships, less &quot;Champlin&quot;, continued on through the Panama Canal on 13 November and sailed on to Tongatabu. The ships conducted training exercises while on the way. The ships arrived there on 28 November, and TG 2.6 was disbanded the same day. After refueling on 29 November, &quot;Columbia&quot; was attached to TG 66.6 the following day, along with &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;Saufley&quot;, and &quot;De Haven&quot;. The task group departed the next day for Nouméa, arriving there on 2 December. The task group was disbanded and &quot;Columbia&quot; pulled alongside the repair ship , as she had developed turbine problems on the voyage there. &quot;Prometheus&quot; made temporary repairs that allowed the turbine to operate at low pressure, and &quot;Columbia&quot; could still make . She was then assigned Task Force (TF) 64, which included the fast battleships and &quot;Indiana&quot;, and the destroyers , , , , and . The ships departed on 7 December, intending to rendezvous with a task group centered on the fast battleship the next day.

===Operations in the Solomon Islands===

The two squadrons met at sea on 9 November and the ships were reorganized; &quot;Columbia&quot; became part of TG 67.2, which departed for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides later that afternoon. The ships arrived there a day later, and from 17 to 22 December, the ships were primarily occupied with combat training, including night fighting drills, anti-aircraft shooting practice, and combined squadron maneuvers. Further maintenance was carried out from 23 to 31 December at Espiritu Santo. Task Force 67 sortied on 2 January 1943 to join the fighting in the Guadalcanal campaign in the Solomon Islands. While the ships were en route, one of &quot;Columbia&quot;″s floatplanes fell off its catapult; a man who was in the plane at the time was picked up by one of the escorting destroyers. The task force arrived off Guadalcanal on 4 January and three of the cruisers split off to carry out a bombardment mission while &quot;Columbia&quot; and the rest of the force remained off Guadalcanal to screen a group of transports carrying reinforcements for the island. The next morning, the task force came under air attack from three Aichi D3A dive bombers that damaged the New Zealand cruiser , but &quot;Columbia&quot; was not attacked directly.

The task force arrived back in Espiritu Santo on 8 January, and &quot;Columbia&quot; received a new seaplane to replace the one that had fallen overboard. She launched both of her aircraft on 12 January for training flights, but one of them crashed at sea; searches for the missing pilot eventually found him on 13 January. That day, the ship was transferred to TF 18, which included the escort carriers , , and , the heavy cruisers and , the light cruisers and , and eight destroyers. The light cruisers formed Cruiser Division 12. &quot;Columbia&quot; later received yet another replacement seaplane. TF 18 was moved from Espiritu Santo to Efate.

====Battle of Rennell Island====
The task force sortied on 27 January, bound for the Solomons; two days later, the ships&#x27; air search radars picked up a group of unidentified aircraft approaching the formation. The escort carriers had already been detached to fly ground support missions, so the cruisers and destroyers were caught without air cover. In the ensuing Battle of Rennell Island, the Japanese launched a series of strikes against the American squadron late in the day. The first wave of sixteen Mitsubishi G4M bombers did not engage &quot;Columbia&quot;, but several G4Ms from the second wave of fifteen aircraft attempted to torpedo her. One attacked individually at around 19:34 and missed, though &quot;Columbia&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners also missed the bomber. Shortly thereafter, four more G4Ms began attack runs on the ship, two off her port bow and the other pair off her port quarter. Her anti-aircraft guns destroyed one of the G4Ms, and the rest were forced to break off without launching their torpedoes. At around the same time, two of the torpedoes struck &quot;Chicago&quot;, inflicting severe damage.

&quot;Columbia&quot; and the other cruisers in the unit closed with &quot;Chicago&quot; to provide better defense of the damaged vessel, but around 21:30, the Japanese aircraft that were shadowing the Americans withdrew. The task groups split up after midnight but re-formed later in the morning of 30 January. By that time, &quot;Chicago&quot;″s engines had broken down, and she was being towed by the heavy cruiser at a speed of . &quot;Columbia&quot; remained with &quot;Chicago&quot; while the tugboat came from Tulagi; at around 14:30, &quot;Columbia&quot; and the other light cruisers were detached to head back to Port Havannah on Efate, but around two hours later, the Japanese launched further attacks on &quot;Chicago&quot;, this time inflicting fatal damage. &quot;Columbia&quot;″s group was too far away to intervene, but the ships&#x27; crews nevertheless went to general quarters. The ships arrived at Efate the afternoon of 31 January, but they remained in port for just a day, sorting the following afternoon for patrols off the Santa Cruz Islands.

====Training operations====
The ships of TF 18 carried out training maneuvers from 1 to 3 February, and then met up with TF 69 the following day; the other task force included the old battleships , , , and , three escort carriers, and several destroyers. The two task forces were to patrol between the Solomons and Samoa to try to intercept a Japanese squadron believed to have sortied from Truk in the central Pacific. The ships remained in the area for several days, searching for the Japanese squadron in vain through 10 February. That day, the Americans learned that the Japanese force had returned to port, and in the meantime, the Japanese had launched Operation Ke, their surprise withdrawal from Guadalcanal. &quot;Columbia&quot; and the rest of TF 18 accordingly ended their patrolling and returned to Efate. By that time, her sister had arrived there with a replacement turbine for her damaged engine. The ships reached Savannah on 14 February, where she and the rest of Cruiser Division 12 were transferred to TF 68.

The ships of TF 68 sortied again on 19 February, heading back toward the Solomons; this time, they were to divert Japanese attention from an amphibious assault force that was to land on the Russell Islands, codenamed Operation Cleanslate. The cruisers were also to provide close defense of the invasion fleet against a possible raid by Japanese warships. On the night of 20/21 February, the ships passed through Ironbottom Sound, the site of several major naval battles during the Guadalcanal campaign, and anchored in Purvis Bay the following morning. The landings occurred without any opposition and &quot;Columbia&quot;, with the rest of TF 68, got underway for Noumea on 23 February. While at sea two days later, &quot;Columbia&quot; was detached to sail to Maré Island, where final repairs to her new turbine would be completed by &quot;Prometheus&quot;. She arrived there on 27 February, and the work lasted until 11 March. On 16 March, TF 68 was redesignated as TF 19; the ships spent most of the month carrying out training exercises, including maneuvers with TF 14, centered on the carrier . Captain Frank Beatty took command of &quot;Columbia&quot; on 6 April. By this time, the Japanese had effectively abandoned the southern Solomons, leaving little opposition in the area to engage. As a result, &quot;Columbia&quot; spent the next several months training with the rest of her task force, and occasionally with other units as well.

====New Georgia campaign====

On 27 June, the ships of Cruiser Division 12 were transferred to TG 36.2, and they sortied later that day for Purvis Bay to take part in Operation Toenails, the invasion of the New Georgia Islands in the central Solomons. The ships arrived there two days later and refueled on the morning of 29 June, before departing again to bombard Japanese positions on other, nearby islands. &quot;Columbia&quot; and her division-mates were assigned to cover minelayers and to shell several of the Shortland Islands to draw Japanese attention away from the landings. &quot;Columbia&quot; fired some 943 rounds from her main battery and 525 shells from her 5-inc guns at Faisi before the Americans broke off and returned southeast to cover the withdrawal of the minelayers. After refueling at Tulagi, &quot;Columbia&quot; arrived back in Espiritu Santo on 2 July to replenish ammunition and stores. She sortied with the rest of her unit the following day to return to operations off New Georgia, carrying out patrols in the area between 6 and 11 July, operating out of Purvis Bay or Tulagi during this period. The ship did not encounter significant Japanese forces during these patrols.

At around midnight on 12 July, &quot;Columbia&quot; and the rest of her task group sortied to carry out a bombardment of Munda on New Georgia to support US Army forces fighting during the drive on Munda Point. By about 03:00 on 12 July, the ships had arrived off the island, and &quot;Columbia&quot; conducted a 30-minute bombardment of the Japanese positions there. The Americans had turned to withdraw by 04:09, bound for Tulagi. &quot;Columbia&quot; and the rest of Cruiser Division 12 later continued on to Espiritu Santo, arriving there on 18 July. The ships of her task group spent the next two and a half months operating out of Espiritu Santo, patrolling in the Solomons and conducting training exercises in the area, but saw no further combat during this period. On 6 September, &quot;Columbia&quot; was detached for an overhaul at Sydney, Australia, arriving there four days later. Work was completed by 20 September, allowing the cruiser to return to her unit, which had by then been re-designated again, now as TG 39.2. On arriving on 24 September, she took over the role of task force flagship, under the command of Rear Admiral Aaron S. Merrill.

On 25–26 September, &quot;Columbia&quot; led her task group on a sweep off Vella LaVella, the westernmost of the New Georgia Islands. Shortly after midnight on 26 September, several Japanese scout planes began shadowing the vessels, and &quot;Columbia&quot; drove one of them off 5-inch gun fire. The Americans reported a number of torpedo wakes from Japanese submarines believed to have been directed by the scout planes. The ship was not hit by any of the torpedoes, and the task group returned to Tulagi to refuel later that day. Task Group 39.2 made several abortive sorties over the following days, but every time the cruisers were recalled to Tulagi to avoid risking them. The ships returned to Espiritu Santo in early October, but by the 7th, had already returned to the Solomons for training exercises with several warships from other task forces through 10 October.

Admiral William F. Halsey visited Merrill aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; at Espiritu Santo on 21 October, and he gave a speech to the crew while he was aboard. Three days later, Merrill shifted his flag to &quot;Cleveland&quot;, and &quot;Columbia&quot; reverted to serving as the flagship of TG 39.2. The ships got underway later that day to cover Operation Goodtime, the invasion of the Treasury Islands. The assault took place on 27 October, and brought the Allies another step up the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville, the largest island in the Solomons chain. The ships of TF 39 first went to bombard the Japanese airfield at Buka on Bougainville on the night of 31 October – 1 November to destroy aircraft that might try to interfere in the invasion of the Treasury Islands, and to draw Japanese attention away from the invasion fleet. In the early hours of 1 November, &quot;Columbia&quot; and the rest of TF 39 were spotted by Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, which dropped flares to illuminate the ships for Japanese coastal artillery batteries on Faisi. &quot;Columbia&quot; and the other cruisers returned fire, and after a short artillery duel, the Americans broke off at around 07:00 to refuel for further operations. The ships of TF 39 remained in the area through the day on 1 November to cover the invasion force as the ground forces went ashore.

=====Battle of Empress Augusta Bay=====

On the evening of 1 November, TF 39 cruised in Empress Augusta Bay in Bougainville, when shortly before 01:00, the American ships picked up a Japanese surface force approaching. In the ensuing Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, the Americans fired first at around 02:45, the destroyers launching a spread of torpedoes at the oncoming Japanese squadron, which consisted of the heavy cruisers and , the light cruisers and , and the destroyers , , , , , and , along with four more destroyers—, , , and —serving as fast transports. A few minutes after the destroyers launched their torpedoes, &quot;Cleveland&quot; and &quot;Denver&quot;, followed shortly thereafter by &quot;Columbia&quot;, opened fire at a range of around . The Japanese destroyer began maneuvering erratically in a circle, indicating it was disabled. &quot;Columbia&quot; shifted fire to another vessel, which soon turned away and withdrew out of range. &quot;Columbia&quot; then engaged a third vessel for several minutes, from 03:11 to 03:32. By that time, &quot;Columbia&quot; had been hit once in return, but the shell struck her bow and did negligible damage.

Both sides had ceased firing by 03:35 and the Japanese had turned back for Rabaul. The American squadron likewise disengaged and returned to cover the invasion fleet. In the course of the action, the Americans had sunk &quot;Sendai&quot; and &quot;Hatsukaze&quot; and damaged &quot;Myoko&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot;; and in the confusion, the two heavy cruisers collided, causing further damage. In return, several American destroyers were damaged in the engagement, including , which had been crippled by a Japanese torpedo. For his role in the battle, Beatty was awarded the Navy Cross; the ship received the Navy Unit Commendation. On 3 November, TF 39 escorted the invasion fleet back to Purvis Bay.

====End of the Solomons campaign====
&quot;Columbia&quot; and other elements of TF 39 returned to Empress Augusta Bay on 4 November to resume operations in support of subsequent landings on Bougainville. The ships remained on station for several days, patrolling for Japanese warships and frequently fending off Japanese search planes and bombers. On 13 November, &quot;Denver&quot; was torpedoed and disabled by a G4M bomber; &quot;Columbia&quot; and the rest of the task force escorted her as she was towed out of the area. &quot;Columbia&quot; spent the rest of November anchored at Purvis Bay, and on 1 December, she had an FH radar set installed. The next day, she sortied to calibrate the new radar; various training exercises followed for several days, until 7 December, when she and the rest of TF 39 made a sweep between Buka and Rabaul that failed to locate any Japanese vessels. On the night of 23–24 December, she bombarded Buka again, damaging the airfield there. &quot;Columbia&quot; departed for Espiritu Santo on 3 January 1944, arriving there the following day. She was dry docked there from 19 to 26 January for periodic maintenance. In February, the ships of TF 39 returned to patrol duty between Buka and Rabaul, but they saw no significant action for the first two weeks of the month.

On 13 February, &quot;Columbia&quot; and the rest of her task force got underway to participate in the invasion of the Green Islands, which were situated between Bougainville and Rabaul. The invasion was one of the last stages of Operation Cartwheel, the plan to neutralize Rabaul. The ships remained on station through 16 February and did not encounter significant Japanese forces. The ships then returned to Purvis Bay, where they remained for the rest of the month. On 5 March, the ships sortied for a sweep between Truk and Kavieng to search for Japanese shipping, but arrived back in Purvis on 11 March without having found any ships to attack.

The ships of TF 39 next sortied on 17 March to take part in the landing on Emirau, the last component of Operation Cartwheel. The ships reached the islands late on 19 March, the day before the landings. No opposition was encountered on the island, so &quot;Columbia&quot; did not need to provide fire support. The ships remained on station for another day, but returned to Purvis Bay on 23 March. She remained there for the next two weeks, seeing no further action. On 4 April, she departed for San Francisco, California, for a thorough overhaul. The work lasted from 23 April to 20 June, and during this period, Captain Maurice E. Curts relieved Beatty as the ship&#x27;s commander. Defects with her main battery elevation gear identified during post-overhaul trials necessitated further work, and she was not ready to return to operations in the Pacific until 29 June. She reached Pearl Harbor on 6 July, where additional minor repairs were identified. Underway again on 13 July, she carried out further testing and exercises in Hawaiian waters through the end of the month.

===Mariana and Palau Islands campaign===
&quot;Columbia&quot; continued to experience mechanical problems into August; the period from to 2 to 8 August was spent attempting to correct the gas ejection system of Turret IV. Training exercises followed on 9 August, and with her main battery now fully operational, was assigned to Task Group 31.12, part of the fire support group for the upcoming invasion of Anguar. She left Pearl Harbor to join the unit on 12 August, passing through Guadalcanal on the way, and arriving in Purvis Bay on 24 August. There she rejoined Cruiser Division 12, which was a component of TG 32.12; the ships sortied on the afternoon of 29 August to participate in a mock landing at Cape Esperance, though the group was missing the battleships and , which had been delayed. The practice landing took place the following morning and additional shooting practice occurred on 31 August.

By early September, the two battleships had arrived, and the task group sortied on the morning of 6 September. Late on 11 September, the ships closed with the island to begin preparations for the bombardment of Anguar the following morning. &quot;Columbia&quot; opened fire at 06:00 and spent most of the day bombarding targets on Anguar; one of her seaplanes crashed on landing next to the ship, though the crew was rescued and the plane was quickly replaced. At 17:51, &quot;Columbia&quot; departed from the island for the night. She carried out a similar schedule of bombardment over the following two days, though on 14 September, she also helped to cover the activities of underwater demolition teams as they cleared paths for the landing force. Bombardment missions continued on 15 September, when neighboring Peleliu was invaded. On 17 September, American forces went ashore on Anguar; &quot;Columbia&quot; patrolled off shore to provide fire support as the soldiers fought their way across the island, though by 19 September, this was no longer necessary and she withdrew to refuel on the 20th. The ship then proceeded to Kossol Roads in Palau to replenish ammunition and supplies.

On 25 September, &quot;Columbia&quot; departed in company with Task Unit 32.19.9, bound for Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, part of the Admiralty Islands. The unit also included the older battleships &quot;Maryland&quot;, , , &quot;Tennessee&quot;, &quot;Mississippi&quot;, the heavy cruisers &quot;Louisville&quot; and , the light cruiser &quot;Denver&quot;, and an escort of six destroyers. The ships arrived in Manus on the afternoon of 28 September, where they refueled. The task unit was dissolved there, and in early October, &quot;Columbia&quot; underwent minor repairs and replenished ammunition and other supplies. On 6 October, she was assigned to Task Group 77.2, part of the Seventh Fleet. The unit remained in Manus until 12 October, when the ships sortied to begin the campaign to liberate the Philippines.

===Philippines campaign===

====Battles of Leyte and Leyte Gulf====
While en route, &quot;Columbia&quot; refueled from the fleet oiler on 16 October. The next day, she was assigned to Task Unit 78.4.3, part of the fire support force for the assault on Dinagat Island, the preparatory bombardment for which began later on the 17th. &quot;Columbia&quot; shelled Japanese positions over the following week, and during that period she contributed her anti-aircraft battery to the invasion fleet&#x27;s defense. Following the attack on Dingat, the fleet moved on to Leyte on 20 October. During the landings on Leyte, &quot;Columbia&quot; provided fire support and engaged in counter-battery fire against Japanese mortars. Late on the 20th, a Nakajima B5N torpedo bomber appeared, forcing &quot;Columbia&quot; to take evasive maneuvers. The Japanese aircraft hit the light cruiser , inflicting serious damage. &quot;Columbia&quot; came alongside to provide assistance, including sending part of her medical staff to tend to the wounded. &quot;Columbia&quot; remained on station for the next few days, providing fire support to the soldiers fighting their way across the island. She remained on station through 24 October.

In response to the Allied invasion of the Philippines, Japan launched a major naval counter-attack that resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Late on the 24th, the Seventh Fleet commander—Vice Admiral Thomas Kinkaid—received reports that a Japanese force was approaching from the south, and would pass through the Surigao Strait to attack the invasion fleet. The Japanese force, centered on the battleships and , was commanded by Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura. Kinkaid ordered the bombardment force, which included &quot;Columbia&quot;, to take up a blocking position at the exit of the strait to protect the fleet. In the ensuing action early the following morning, &quot;Colubmia&quot; assisted in the destruction of the Japanese force. By around 5:30, Nishimura had been defeated, and soon thereafter, &quot;Columbia&quot; was detached to finish off crippled Japanese ships. She assisted in the sinking of the destroyer during this period. She received no hits in return. &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Denver&quot; were nearly out of ammunition by this point, and were detached to rearm later on 25 October.

====Patrolling Leyte Gulf and the Battle of Mindoro====
&quot;Columbia&quot; spent the next four days refueling and rearming, but these operations were repeatedly interrupted by the need to take evasive maneuvers in response to heavy Japanese air attacks. These included several attempted strikes. After finishing resupplying fuel and ammunition, &quot;Columbia&quot; provided anti-aircraft defense to other ships attempting to replenish. On 29 October, the ships of TG 77.2 departed for Seeadler Harbor, arriving there on 3 November. There, the ships made preparations for the next major operation in the Philippines campaign. On 10 November, TG 77.2 got underway for Kossol Roads, where they refueled and joined supply convoys headed to the Philippines. Beginning on 14 November, &quot;Columbia&quot; and the other ships patrolled Leyte Gulf, covering the convoys as they carried reinforcements and supplies to the Philippines. The ships came under repeated air attacks, but &quot;Columbia&quot; was only attacked directly once, on 18 November, by a Aichi D3A dive bomber. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft gunners shot down the plane, which missed with its bomb. She remained on station through the end of the month, and on 27 November, the Japanese launched a major strike on the ships in Leyte Gulf. During this battle, &quot;Columbia&quot; shot down three Yokosuka D4Y torpedo bombers, and struck &quot;Colorado&quot; and the light cruiser .

After refueling underway on 30 November, &quot;Columbia&quot; resumed patrol duties in the gulf in December. A Japanese submarine attacked TG 77.2 late on the afternoon of 1 December, but failed to damage any of the ships. TG 77.2 withdrew to Kossol Roads on 4 December to replenish supplies. &quot;Columbia&quot; was transferred to TG 77.12 on 5 December, part of the invasion fleet for the upcoming attack on Mindoro. The ships sortied on 10 December to begin the operation against Mindoro. By 13 December, the fleet had arrived off the target island, and the Japanese responded with concerted air attacks, which &quot;Columbia&quot; helped to defend against, shooting down one Mitsubishi Ki-21 bomber. Japanese attacks continued the following day, though the combat air patrol fighters intercepted the initial waves. After engaging a subsequent strike later in the afternoon, the ship&#x27;s forward 5-inch mount accidentally fired a shell while the crew were attempting to unload it. The gun was pointed at the port side director for the 40 mm guns; it hit the structure and killed four men inside. Another thirty men were wounded, six of whom were seriously hurt. The four fatalities were buried at sea the next day. The landing on Mindoro began on the morning of 15 December, and during the landing, &quot;Columbia&quot; destroyed a pair of Japanese bombers that closed with the invasion fleet, and assisted in the destruction of other planes, including a pair of that attempted to hit the escort carrier .

Over the following few days, &quot;Columbia&quot; provided gunfire support to the soldiers fighting inland from the beachhead and contributed her anti-aircraft battery to the defense of supply ships that were bringing reinforcements to the island. On 17 December, the ships of TG 77.12 departed for Kossol Roads; on the way, &quot;Columbia&quot; refueled some of the escorting destroyers. The ships arrived there late on 19 December, refilled their oil bunkers, and then departed the next day for Seeadler Harbor. They reached their destination on 23 December, and the ships&#x27; crews immediately began preparations for the next major phase of the Philippines campaign. &quot;Columbia&quot; sortied again on 26 December, steaming in company with Battleship Division 4, once more bound for Kossol Roads. On the way, the ships conducted various training exercises, including shooting practice.

====Battle of Lingayen Gulf====

On 1 January 1945, &quot;Columbia&quot; was returned to TG 77.2, which was again part of the bombardment force for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf on the main island of Luzon. The ships departed Kossol Roads early that morning, and after entering Filipino waters late on the 2nd, the ships arranged themselves in a defensive formation around several escort carriers. &quot;Columbia&quot; formed part of the rearguard formation. On the morning of 3 January, Japanese reconnaissance aircraft spotted the American fleet, which instigated a series of increasingly severe attacks over the following two days. These included a strike on the escort carrier on 4 January that resulted in the destruction of the vessel. Heavy strikes followed on 5 January, and several vessels were hit. That night, &quot;Columbia&quot; moved into the vanguard formation; Japanese aircraft shadowed the fleet through the night to track its movements.

The next morning, the ships of TG 77.2 began their preparatory bombardment of Santiago Island, which lay at the western end of Lingayen Gulf. Heavy attacks met the Allied ships, and several vessels were hit that day. As the vessels were preparing to enter Lingayen Gulf itself later that afternoon, a Mitsubishi A6M Zero dove on &quot;Columbia&quot;, but heavy anti-aircraft fire forced the plane to pull up at the last moment. The plane struck the ship&#x27;s radio antennae and crashed into the sea just beyond her starboard side. Fuel from the Zero sprayed across the ship, but failed to ignite. About an hour later, the Allied ships entered a channel that had been swept of mines to bombard the invasion beaches, but the channel dramatically reduced their ability to take evasive maneuvers in the face of determined attacks, and after less than two hours of bombardment, the Allies were forced to retreat.

Shortly after the ships reversed course—placing &quot;Columbia&quot; in the lead of the formation—an Aichi D3A dove on &quot;Columbia&quot;. The ship&#x27;s gunners struck the oncoming plane, but did not damage it sufficiently to prevent it from crashing into her deck abreast of the rearmost turret. The dive bomber was carrying an armor-piercing bomb, which penetrated into the ship before exploding. The blast started a major fire, disabled both after turrets, and caused significant flooding aft. Seventeen men were killed in the attack, sixty were wounded, and another twenty were missing. &quot;Columbia&quot;″s seaplane was also destroyed in the attack. But the ship remained in action, and her anti-aircraft gunners soon contributed to the destruction of another that attempted to crash into . Her forward turrets also continued to bombard targets ashore as the task group withdrew. In total, 21 ships were hit by over the course of the day&#x27;s operations.
Through 8 January, the ships remained in the area, continuing their shore bombardment mission, though Japanese air attacks tapered during this period. &quot;Columbia&quot;″s crew continued to make repairs to the ship to control flooding. The invasion began the next morning, which prompted a resumption of heavy attacks. At around 07:45, a Nakajima Ki-44 fighter crashed into &quot;Columbia&quot;, knocking her forward main battery fire control director completely off the ship. The plane was carrying a bomb, which detonated on the deck and started a fire and inflicted heavy casualties. The strike killed 17 men, wounded another 97, and six were declared missing. In total, the two attacks had inflicted 191 casualties. In the days that followed, several of the more severely wounded men died from their injuries. &quot;Columbia&quot; nevertheless remained on station for the rest of the day, providing gunfire to soften up the beach defenses and then close-range support the troops as they fought their way ashore. Through the day, wounded men were evacuated to the transport and repair work was begun. Another vessel sent medical supplies to &quot;Columbia&quot; to assist with treatment of the casualties still aboard the ship.

For their actions during the battle, numerous men received awards for valor, including Curts, who was awarded a Silver Star; 170 men received Purple Hearts. The crew was also awarded a Navy Unit Commendation for remaining in action after three strikes and heavy casualties. With the ground forces having successfully landed with little Japanese opposition, &quot;Columbia&quot; received orders at 17:50 to depart as part of the escort for Task Force 79, the amphibious assault transports. About forty minutes later, the ships began steaming out of the gulf, and &quot;Columbia&quot; rendezvoused with the force as it assembled off San Fernando. By 21:30, the ships were underway for Leyte Gulf. The ships sailed south, and by 12 January they had reached the Mindanao Sea, where &quot;Columbia&quot; and several other ships that had been damaged by were ordered north to San Pedro Bay at Leyte. There, the ships received emergency repairs; for &quot;Columbia&quot;, this included patching a pair of holes below the waterline by divers. On 14 January, she got underway for Seeadler Harbor in company with the other damaged ships and screened by destroyers, arriving on 18 January.

===Repairs===
&quot;Columbia&quot; remained at Seeadler Harbor From 19 to 21 January, where temporary repairs were effected to permit the ship to make the voyage back to the United States. These included patching the hull with concrete and reinforcing internal supports that had been damaged by the impacts and fires. Ammunition was also removed from damaged areas where possible. The ship departed on 22 January, bound for Pearl Harbor, and while en route, she met up with &quot;Louisville&quot; and the destroyer , both of which had also been badly damaged in the Lingayen Gulf operation. The ships arrived in Pearl Harbor on 29 January. &quot;Columbia&quot; underwent an inspection to determine the scale of the damage, during which time additional temporary repairs were made. On 6 February, she left for San Pedro, California, for a thorough overhaul and permanent repairs. She arrived there on 11 February and was dry-docked the next day.

Repair work and modifications lasted into mid-April, and on the 17th, she underwent her first round of sea trials. Full power tests were carried out on 24 April, though the tests ended in failure when fires broke out and oil pressure could not be maintained in her starboard engine. After repairs, another attempt was made on 29 April, which was completed successfully. Over the following five days, further tests were carried out, including test firing the main and secondary batteries, and ammunition was loaded. The upgrades to the ship included replacing the single 20 mm Oerlikons with twin mounts, improved radars were installed, and the main battery turrets were improved for better night firing capabilities. On 4 May, the ship sailed to begin training exercises in preparation to return to combat. During full power tests on 7 May, one of her turbines leaked, necessitating another round of repairs in dry dock. She was able to resume testing on 13 May, and was pronounced fit for service later that day. On 15 May, she departed for Pearl Harbor.

On the way to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Columbia&quot;″s crew conducted training exercises. After arriving on 20 May, the crew carried out maintenance work from 21 to 23 May. The ship took part in combat training exercises from 24 to 30 May, and then remained at anchor from 31 May to 2 June. The ship departed to return to the western Pacific that day, joining Task Unit 12.5.5 for the voyage to Ulithi, which was by then the fleet&#x27;s forward operating base in the Caroline Islands. The ships arrived there on 13 June, and the task unit was thereafter dissolved.

===End of the war===
On 14 June, &quot;Columbia&quot; and several destroyers left for Leyte, where two days later, &quot;Columbia&quot; was assigned to the covering force for the invasion of Balikpapap in Borneo. She departed on 19 June and rejoined her old unit, Cruiser Division 12, four days later; the unit included &quot;Denver&quot; and &quot;Montpelier&quot;, and formed part of Task Group 74.2. The preparatory bombardments began later on 23 June and continued for several days. During this period, on 26 June, she picked up survivors from two minesweepers that struck mines and sank. The landings took place on 1 July, and &quot;Columbia&quot; provided fire support as the men made their way inland. TG 74.2 was then sent south on 2 July to patrol against any Japanese naval forces that might try to interfere with the landing, though none appeared, and the ships of Cruiser Division 12 were soon ordered north to Leyte. They arrived in San Pedro Bay on 5 July, and &quot;Columbia&quot;″s crew immediately set about refueling, carrying out maintenance on the ship, and conducting training while in harbor.

On 7 July, &quot;Columbia&quot; and her sisters in the division were assigned to Task Force 95, which had been created to sweep across the East China Sea to search for Japanese merchant shipping in the area. The unit was centered on the two large cruisers. The ships sailed north on 13 July, stopping in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, to refuel, before beginning their sweep late on 16 July. A typhoon forced the ships to withdraw to the east on 17 and 18 July, though they had resumed their patrol to the Chinese coast the following day. They encountered little of note, beyond a stray Japanese aircraft and several sampans, before returning to Okinawa on 22 July. Four days later, the ships sortied again for another sweep, this time into the Yellow Sea. While cruising off Shanghai, China, lookouts spotted several vessels but determined they were crewed by Chinese citizens, and so the American ships did not engage them. They returned to Okinawa on 29 July, once again having failed to locate any significant Japanese activity.

The ships of TF 95 sorties again on 1 August, but another typhoon forced them to withdraw to the south the following day. They returned to the operational area on 3 August, and over the following days, the ships encountered a few Japanese aircraft, though the escorting combat air patrol shot them down or drove them off without incident. &quot;Columbia&quot; and the rest of the task group arrived back in Okinawa on the morning of 8 August. The ships remained in port for the next several days, until 13 August, when they sortied briefly. After returning to port on 15 August, the ships were informed of the Japanese decision to surrender. The unit carried out training exercises in the area east of Okinawa through the end of the month. For the ship&#x27;s actions during the war, &quot;Columbia&quot; received ten battle stars, in addition to the two Navy Unit Commendations.

&quot;Columbia&quot; was initially assigned to the force that was to begin the occupation of Japan, as part of Task Force 56. The ship&#x27;s orders were changed shortly after the unit got underway on 9 September, and she was redirected to the Mariana Islands. She stopped at Iwo Jima on the way and embarked passengers bound for Saipan in the Marianas. She arrived in Saipan on 15 September, sent the passengers ashore, and then embarked others to take them to Guam. After reaching Apra Harbor on Guam on 18 September, Vice Admiral George D. Murray made the vessel his flagship. She remained in Guam for the rest of the month, but on 1 October, she got underway to take inspection parties to Truk to oversee the recently surrendered Japanese garrison there. She arrived there two days later and embarked a Japanese delegation that included Vice Admiral Chūichi Hara and Lieutenant General Toshisaburo Mugikura. Over the following days, the inspection party landed and several islands in the atoll. They found that the Japanese garrison was in poor condition, owing to shortages of food and medical supplies; that most of the facilities had been destroyed by bombing during the war; and that coastal artillery batteries had been disabled by the removal of their breechblocks.

The ship then returned to Guam, arriving in Apra on 8 October. She was dry-docked there on 11 October for periodic maintenance along with repairs to her number 3 propeller shaft. Work was completed by 15 October, and she remained in port for the next three days. &quot;Columbia&quot; spent the rest of the month shuttling soldiers, sailors, and marines between Guam, Saipan, and Iwo Jima. On 19 October, she took on passengers for transport to Saipan, arriving the following day. She then embarked other men, who were en route to Iwo Jima, and sailed later on 20 October. The ship reached that island two days later and exchanged her passengers for another group of men who were traveling to Saipan. Arriving there on 24 October, &quot;Columbia&quot; disembarked those travelers, embarked others headed to Iwo Jima, and sailed again later that evening. The ship reached Iwo Jima on the morning of 25 October, embarked another group to return to Saipan. By 28 October, she was back in Saipan, where she took on other men bound for Guam, which was to be the last of her regional shuttle trips. &quot;Columbia&quot; got underway for the West Coast of the United States on 31 October, carrying more than 500 passengers bound for home. She stopped in Pearl Harbor on the way, where some of the passengers left the ship, before continuing on to San Pedro, California, arriving on 17 November.

===Post-war service===
&quot;Columbia&quot; left California on 20 November, bound for the East Coast of the United States. She briefly cruised with her sister &quot;Cleveland&quot; while on the way, before passing through the Panama Canal on 30 November. &quot;Columbia&quot; arrived in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 5 December, where and overhaul was carried out. In early 1946, the ship was assigned to training duties for naval cadets from the US Naval Reserve. On 24 February, the first such voyage began with a contingent of 168 men from the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps. The ship sailed to Chesapeake Bay, then to Hampton Roads, Virginia, before returning to Philadelphia on 2 March. She next moved to Newport, Rhode Island, on 25 March, to begin the next training cruise.

On 1 June, &quot;Columbia&quot; was assigned to the Sixteenth Fleet, part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, though she remained in service for training operations. The next day, she moved to her namesake city to participate in Columbia Day, during which the ship was open to public tours. She thereafter embarked on a cruise that took her as far south as Bermuda in the Caribbean, and as far north as Canada. During this period, she stopped in New York; Casco Bay, Maine; Halifax, Nova Scotia; and various ports in Quebec and Ontario, Canada. She arrived back in Philadelphia on 28 June.

&quot;Columbia&quot; was initially kept in commission after she was placed in reserve on 30 October, stationed in Philadelphia. On 30 November, she was decommissioned before being formally allocated to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 7 February 1947. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until early 1959. She was sold to the Boston Metals Company on 18 February 1959, though she was not actually stricken from the Naval Vessel Register until 1 March. She was thereafter towed to the breaker&#x27;s yard to be broken up between November and December that year.

<text>Oldham County High School (OCHS) is a public high school in Buckner, Kentucky, United States. It was founded in 1953 and has a student body of approximately 1,600 students in grades 9-12. OCHS was given the National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence award in 1985 and 2002 respectively.

==History==
In the early 20th century, high school classes in Oldham County were held in a two-room house in Centerfield. Oldham County had established the Oldham County Public High School by 1903, i a purpose-built high school building. It moved to North Hwy 393 in LaGrange in 1953. The old high school was converted into First Baptist Church of La Grange in the mid-1960s. The original building burned in the 1990s, replaced by a church.

In 1989 South Oldham High School opened due to overcrowding at Oldham, and in 2003 North Oldham High School opened as the community grew.

The school gained accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1960.

==Notable alumni==

<doc id="562002" wikidata="Q747139" url="?curid=562002" title="USS Columbus (CA-74)">
<text>The third USS &quot;Columbus&quot; (CA-74/CG-12), a heavy cruiser, was the first ship of the United States Navy named for Columbus, Ohio. She was launched on 30 November 1944 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Quincy, Massachusetts; she was sponsored by Mrs. E. G. Meyers; and commissioned on 8 June 1945.

==History==

===As CA-74===

Joining the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Columbus&quot; reached Tsingtao, China, on 13 January 1946 for occupation duty. On 1 April, she helped to sink 24 Japanese submarines, prizes of war, and next day sailed for San Pedro, California. For the remainder of the year, she operated in west coast waters, then made a second Far Eastern cruise from 15 January to 12 June 1947.

After west coast operations and an overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, &quot;Columbus&quot; cleared Bremerton on 12 April 1948 to join the Atlantic Fleet, arriving at Norfolk, Va., on 19 May. &quot;Columbus&quot; made two cruises as flagship of Commander-in-Chief, Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, from 13 September 1948 to 15 December 1949 and from 12 June 1950 to 5 October 1951, and one as flagship of Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, during parts of NATO Operation Mainbrace from 25 August to 29 September 1952. She cruised in the Mediterranean from October 1952 through January 1953, serving part of that time as flagship of the 6th Fleet. Now flagship of Cruiser Division 6, she returned to the Mediterranean from September 1954 to January 1955. Between deployments, &quot;Columbus&quot; received necessary overhauls and carried out training operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean.

Reassigned to the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Columbus&quot; cleared Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 November 1955 for Long Beach, California, where she arrived on 2 December. Just a month later, on 5 January 1956, she sailed for Yokosuka, Japan, and operated with the 7th Fleet until she returned to Long Beach on 8 July. &quot;Columbus&quot; made two more cruises to the Far East in 1957 and 1958. During the late summer of 1958, her presence was a reminder of American strength and interest as she patrolled the Taiwan Straits during the crisis brought on by the renewed shelling of the offshore islands by the Chinese communists. In late 1958 she was selected to be converted to carry guided missiles and on 8 May 1959, &quot;Columbus&quot; entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to begin her conversion to an &quot;Albany&quot;-class guided missile cruiser.

===As CG-12===
On 30 September 1959, &quot;Columbus&quot; was retrofitted as an guided missile cruiser, joining and as the only three ships of this line, and reclassified CG-12. USS &quot;Columbus&quot; (CG-12) was subsequently recommissioned on 1 December 1962 (following a much shorter conversion period than either &quot;Chicago&quot; or &quot;Albany&quot;), though a year and half long work-up and testing of her new weapons system delayed her first deployment to the western Pacific until August 1964.

The 1959 &quot;Albany&quot;-class refit of USS &quot;Columbus&quot; left CG-12 with the following armaments:
* RIM-8 Talos - 2 twin Talos SAM launch systems
: Fore: Systems 1 &amp; 2, with one launcher; Aft: Systems 7 &amp; 8, with one launcher
* RIM-24 Tartar - 2 twin Tartar SAM launch systems
: Starboard: Systems 3 &amp; 5 with MK11 launcher; Port: Systems 4 &amp; 6 with MK11 launcher
* Anti-submarine - 1 eight-tube ASROC system
* Torpedoes - 2 triple-tube Mk-32 torpedo systems
* two open mount  naval guns port and starboard midships

====Flagship====
After visiting San Francisco, Puget Sound, and Hawaii as flagship of the 1965 Pacific Midshipman Training Squadron,

Parts of the ships are on display in Columbus.

==Awards==
&quot;Columbus&quot; served as Flagship COMCRUDESFLOT throughout 1966, after assignment to the Atlantic Fleet at the start of that year. From 1966 until 1974, &quot;Columbus&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean seven times.
* September 1966 - March 1967
* January 1968 - July 1968
* December 1968 - May 1969
* 8 October 1969 - 18 March 1970
* 6 September 1970 - 1 March 1971
* 17 May 1972 - 18 October 1972
* 2 November 1973 - 31 May 1974

Unlike the &quot;Albany&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;, both of which received further upgrades, &quot;Columbus&quot; did not receive the digital missile fire-control and radar modernizations in 1970 due to cutbacks in the defense budget. The ship did however, receive a 5-month overhaul of her machinery, and heavy maintenance to her electrical and hull structures to keep her operational for another five years. Upon return from her final Mediterranean deployment on 31 May 1974, she entered port and began preparations for deactivation and decommissioning. After serving for 29.5 years, &quot;Columbus&quot; was decommissioned on 31 January 1975, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 August 1976 and sold for scrapping on 3 October 1977, to Union Minerals &amp; Alloys Corp., and scrapped in Port Newark, NJ.

<doc id="562007" wikidata="Q265414" url="?curid=562007" title="Magnesium chloride">
<text>Magnesium chloride is an inorganic compound with the formula . It forms hydrates , where &quot;n&quot; can range from 1 to 12. These salts are colorless or white solids that are highly soluble in water. These compounds and their solutions, both of which occur in nature, have a variety of practical uses. Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.

==Production==
Magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water. In North America and South America, it is obtained primarily from Great Salt Lake brine. In the Jordan Valley, it is obtained from the Dead Sea. The mineral bischofite () is extracted (by solution mining) out of ancient seabeds, for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe. Some deposits result from high content of magnesium chloride in the primordial ocean. Some magnesium chloride is made from evaporation of seawater. 

In the Dow process, magnesium chloride is regenerated from magnesium hydroxide using hydrochloric acid:
It can also be prepared from magnesium carbonate by a similar reaction.

==Structure==
 crystallizes in the cadmium chloride motif, therefore it loses water upon heating: &quot;n&quot; = 12 (−16.4 °C), 8 (−3.4 °C), 6 (116.7 °C), 4 (181 °C), 2 (about 300 °C). In the hexahydrate, the is also octahedral, being coordinated to six water ligands. The octahydrate and the dodecahydrate can be crystallized from water below 298K. As verified by X-ray crystallography, these &quot;higher&quot; hydrates also feature [Mg(H2O)6]2+ ions. A decahydrate has also been crystallized. 

==Preparation, general properties==
Anhydrous is produced industrially by heating the complex salt named hexamminemagnesium dichloride . The thermal dehydration of the hydrates (&quot;n&quot; = 6, 12) does not occur straightforwardly. 

As suggested by the existence of hydrates, anhydrous is a Lewis acid, although a weak one. One derivative is tetraethylammonium tetrachloromagnesate . The adduct is another. In the coordination polymer with the formula , Mg adopts an octahedral geometry. The Lewis acidity of magnesium chloride is reflected in its deliquescence, meaning that it attracts moisture from the air to the extent that the solid turns into a liquid.

==Applications==
===Precursor to metallic magnesium===
Anhydrous is the main precursor to metallic magnesium. The reduction of into metallic Mg is performed by electrolysis in molten salt. As it is also the case for aluminium, an electrolysis in aqueous solution is not possible as the produced metallic magnesium would immediately react with water, or in other words that the water would be reduced into gaseous before Mg reduction could occur. So, the direct electrolysis of molten in the absence of water is required because the reduction potential to obtain Mg is lower than the stability domain of water on an Eh–pH diagram (Pourbaix diagram). 
The production of metallic magnesium at the cathode (reduction reaction) is accompanied by the oxidation of the chloride anions at the anode with release of gaseous chlorine. This process is developed at a large industrial scale.

=== Dust and erosion control ===
Magnesium chloride is one of many substances used for dust control, soil stabilization, and wind erosion mitigation. When magnesium chloride is applied to roads and bare soil areas, both positive and negative performance issues occur which are related to many application factors.

===Catalysis===
Ziegler-Natta catalysts, used commercially to produce polyolefins, often contain as a catalyst support. The introduction of supports increases the activity of traditional catalysts and allowed the development of highly stereospecific catalysts for the production of polypropylene.

Magnesium chloride is also a Lewis acid catalyst in aldol reactions.

=== Ice control ===

Magnesium chloride is used for low-temperature de-icing of highways, sidewalks, and parking lots. When highways have dangerous ice buildup, road maintainers apply magnesium chloride to deter ice from bonding to the pavement, allowing snow plows to clear treated roads more efficiently.

For the purpose of preventing ice from forming on pavement, magnesium chloride is applied in three ways: anti-icing, which involves spreading it on roads to prevent snow from sticking and forming; prewetting, which means a liquid formulation of magnesium chloride is sprayed directly onto salt as it is being spread onto roadway pavement, wetting the salt so that it sticks to the road; and pretreating, when magnesium chloride and salt are mixed together before they are loaded onto trucks and spread onto paved roads. Calcium chloride damages concrete twice as fast as magnesium chloride. The amount of magnesium chloride is supposed to be controlled when it is used for de-icing as it may cause pollution to the environment.

=== Nutrition and medicine ===
Magnesium chloride is used in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical preparations. The hexahydrate is sometimes advertised as &quot;magnesium oil&quot;.

=== Cuisine ===
Magnesium chloride (E511) is an important coagulant used in the preparation of tofu from soy milk.

In Japan it is sold as &quot;nigari&quot; (にがり, derived from the Japanese word for &quot;bitter&quot;), a white powder produced from seawater after the sodium chloride has been removed, and the water evaporated. In China, it is called &quot;lushui&quot; ().

Nigari or Iushui is, in fact, natural magnesium chloride, meaning that it is not completely refined (it contains up to 5% magnesium sulfate and various minerals). The crystals originate from lakes in the Chinese province of Qinghai, to be then reworked in Japan.

=== Gardening and horticulture ===
Because magnesium is a mobile nutrient, magnesium chloride can be effectively used as a substitute for magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) to help correct magnesium deficiency in plants via foliar feeding. The recommended dose of magnesium chloride is smaller than the recommended dose of magnesium sulfate (20 g/L). This is due primarily to the chlorine present in magnesium chloride, which can easily reach toxic levels if over-applied or applied too often.

It has been found that higher concentrations of magnesium in tomato and some pepper plants can make them more susceptible to disease caused by infection of the bacterium &quot;Xanthomonas campestris&quot;, since magnesium is essential for bacterial growth.

=== Wastewater treatment ===
It is used to supply the magnesium necessary to precipitate phosphorus in the form of struvite from agricultural waste as well as human urine.

==Occurrence==

Magnesium concentrations in natural seawater are between 1250 and 1350 mg/L, around 3.7% of the total seawater mineral content. Dead Sea minerals contain a significantly higher magnesium chloride ratio, 50.8%. Carbonates and calcium are essential for all growth of corals, coralline algae, clams, and invertebrates. Magnesium can be depleted by mangrove plants and the use of excessive limewater or by going beyond natural calcium, alkalinity, and pH values. The most common mineral form of magnesium chloride is its hexahydrate, bischofite. Anhydrous compound occurs very rarely, as chloromagnesite. Magnesium chloride-hydroxides, korshunovskite and nepskoeite, are also very rare.

== Toxicology ==
Magnesium ions are bitter-tasting, and magnesium chloride solutions are bitter in varying degrees, depending on the concentration.

Magnesium toxicity from magnesium salts is rare in healthy individuals with a normal diet, because excess magnesium is readily excreted in urine by the kidneys. A few cases of oral magnesium toxicity have been described in persons with normal renal function ingesting large amounts of magnesium salts, but it is rare. If a large amount of magnesium chloride is eaten, it will have effects similar to magnesium sulfate, causing diarrhea, although the sulfate also contributes to the laxative effect in magnesium sulfate, so the effect from the chloride is not as severe.

=== Plant toxicity ===

Chloride () and magnesium () are both essential nutrients important for normal plant growth. Too much of either nutrient may harm a plant, although foliar chloride concentrations are more strongly related with foliar damage than magnesium. High concentrations of ions in the soil may be toxic or change water relationships such that the plant cannot easily accumulate water and nutrients. Once inside the plant, chloride moves through the water-conducting system and accumulates at the margins of leaves or needles, where dieback occurs first. Leaves are weakened or killed, which can lead to the death of the tree.

<doc id="562029" wikidata="Q2051814" url="?curid=562029" title="Pete Murray (Australian singer-songwriter)">
<text>Peter Kenneth Murray (born 14 October 1969) is an Australian musician who has had three albums reach number 1 on the Australian (ARIA) charts. Murray has received 17 ARIA nominations throughout his career so far. He has sold over 1.2 million albums in Australia.

==Biography==
===1969–2002: Early life and career beginnings===
Peter Kenneth Murray was born in Chinchilla, on 14 October 1969. His mother is Jan and he has a sister. When Murray was 16 the family moved to Brisbane. He attended St Joseph&#x27;s College, Nudgee, for his final two years of secondary schooling. At the college, Murray showed talent in rugby union, athletics, and swimming. He briefly played for Brisbane club rugby for GPS and Brothers. When he was 18, his father died of a heart attack, which made him realise &quot;how precious time was&quot;.

While on the sidelines, Murray started to learn the guitar at age 22. Eventually, he worked up the courage to take his guitar to a barbecue, singing songs by Neil Young and Crowded House. However, his main interest was traveling and pursuing a career in sports medicine.

Murray played small gigs around the country with flautist Col McIntyre, eventually putting a band together (including the keyboard player Ben McCarthy, who works with him to this day).

===2001–2002: &quot;The Game&quot;===
In 2001, Murray released the EP &quot;D Day&quot; followed by the album, &quot;The Game&quot; on Auxiliary Records. Murray moved to Melbourne to pursue a musical career.

===2003–2004: &quot;Feeler&quot;===

In early 2003, Murray signed a contract with Sony BMG and he entered the studio with producer Paul McKercher and his band (consisting of Ben McCarthy on bass guitar and keyboards, Christian Sargeant on drums, Paul Tyrell on guitar and Col McIntyre on reeds &amp; flute) to make the &quot;Feeler&quot; album. 

&quot;Feeler&quot; was released on 21 July 2003 with the title track as the first single. Triple J radio started playing the track with the Nova FM and Triple M networks picking it up. With this support, &quot;Feeler&quot; entered the ARIA top 50 album charts in 2003. His reputation was building fast and he started selling out shows in smaller venues.

&quot;So Beautiful&quot; was released in January 2004, reaching the top ten. This spurred sales of the album driving it to number one on the Australian album charts in late March 2004 and six times platinum status. By 2008, the album had sold half-a-million copies.

===2005–2007: &quot;See the Sun&quot;===

Murray&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;See the Sun&quot;,was released in September 2005. The album spawned three official singles, &quot;Better Days&quot;, &quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;George&#x27;s Helper&quot;, while a video was made for radio single &quot;Class A&quot;. Days after its release, Murray performed at the 2005 NRL grand final. &quot;See the Sun&quot; sold 350,000 copies.

===2008–2010: &quot;Summer at Eureka&quot;===

His fourth studio album, &quot;Summer at Eureka&quot;, was released on 17 May 2008. It entered the charts at number 1 in Australia, his third consecutive chart-topping album. The first single from the album was &quot;You Pick Me Up&quot;, which reached number 36 on the Australian charts. The second single from the album, &quot;Saving Grace&quot;, was released in July 2008.

===2011–2015: &quot;Blue Sky Blue&quot;===

His fifth studio album, &quot;Blue Sky Blue&quot;, was released in Australia on 2 September 2011 and peaked at number 6 in Australia and was certified gold. In 2012, many of the songs were re-recorded with a number of the songs recorded as duets. This album was titled &quot;Blue Sky Blue &quot;The Byron Sessions&quot;&quot; and peaked at number 17 in Australia in 2013.

===2017–2018: &quot;Camacho&quot; ===

In June 2017, Murray released his seventh studio album &quot;Camacho&quot;. The album peaked at number 3 in Australia.

===2020–2022: &quot;The Night&quot; and &quot;Before I Go&quot;===
On 26 June 2020, Murray released &quot;Found My Place&quot;, his first single since &quot;Camacho&quot;. It was the lead single from his EP &quot;The Night&quot;, which was released on 5 March 2021. The EP also featured the singles &quot;If We Never Dance Again&quot; and &quot;Waiting for This Love&quot;. On 17 September 2021, Pete released &quot;Hold Me Steady&quot;, the first single from the follow-up EP, &quot;Before I Go&quot;, released on 1 April 2022.

===2023: &quot;Best Of&quot;===
In February 2023, Murray announced the release of &quot;Best of Pete Murray&quot;. The album was released in May 2023 with a Greatest Hits Tour, commencing in July.

In 2023, Murray was unmasked as &quot;Tiny&quot; on the fifth season of Network 10&#x27;s &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot;. He was unmasked on the sixth episode after his third performance.

==Personal life==
Murray married Amanda Coutts on 7 October 2006 in the New South Wales town of Eureka. In July 2009, Murray and Coutts had separated and shared custody of their two children. Coutts worked as a designer and renovated a set of stables into a home.

In 2016 he married his partner of four years Mira Eady. He resides in Byron Bay.

<doc id="562030" wikidata="Q3258386" url="?curid=562030" title="Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994">
<text>The Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 (c. 39) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that created the current local government structure of 32 unitary authorities covering the whole of Scotland.

It abolished the two-tier structure of regions and districts created by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 which had previously covered Scotland except for the islands council areas.

The Act came into effect on 1 April 1996, beginning with the 1995 Scottish local elections.

== Initial proposals ==
The Secretary of State for Scotland, Ian Lang outlined proposed areas in a statement to the Commons on 8 July 1993. This outlined 25 unitary authorities (apart from the 3 Island Areas), as follows

* City of Aberdeen: existing Aberdeen District plus Westhill area of Gordon District
* Aberdeenshire: Banff and Buchan District, Gordon District less Westhill area, Kincardine and Deeside District less southern part of former County of Kincardineshire
* Angus and Mearns: Angus District, the Monifieth and Sidlaw areas of Dundee District and the southern part of former County of Kincardineshire from Kincardine and Deeside District less
* Argyll and Bute: Argyll and Bute District, western part of Dumbarton District (including Helensburgh)
* Berwickshire and East Lothian: Berwickshire District, East Lothian District less Musselburgh/Fisherrow, Preston/Levenhall areas
* The Borders: Tweeddale District, Ettrick and Lauderdale District, Roxburgh District
* Clackmannan and Falkirk: Clackmannan District, Falkirk District, Kincardine Bridge area of Dunfermline District
* Dumbarton and Clydebank: Clydebank District, Dumbarton District (less Helensburgh area)
* Dumfries and Galloway: Dumfries and Galloway Region
* City of Dundee: Dundee District less Monifieth and Sidlaw areas
* City of Edinburgh: Edinburgh District
* East Dunbartonshire: Bearsden and Milngavie District, Strathkelvin District less area around Chryston formerly in the county of Lanarkshire
* East Renfrewshire: Eastwood District, and the Barrhead area and Paisley suburbs in East Renfrewshire constituency from Renfrew District
* Fife: Fife Region
* City of Glasgow: Glasgow District less Toryglen/King&#x27;s Park, Rutherglen/Fernhill and Cambuslang/Halfway areas
*Highland: Highland Region
*The Lothians: Midlothian District, West Lothian District, the Musselburgh/Fisherrow, Preston/Levenhall areas of East Lothian District
*Moray: Moray District
*North Ayrshire: Cunninghame District, Cumnock and Doon Valley District, Kilmarnock and Loudoun District
*North Lanarkshire: Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District, Monklands District, Motherwell District, the area around Chryston formerly in the county of Lanarkshire from Strathkelvin District
*Perthshire and Kinross: Perth and Kinross District
*South Ayrshire: Kyle and Carrick District
*South Lanarkshire: Clydesdale District, Hamilton District, East Kilbride District, the Toryglen/King&#x27;s Park, Rutherglen/Fernhill and Cambuslang/Halfway areas from Glasgow District
*Stirling: Stirling District
*West Renfrewshire: Inverclyde District, Renfrew District less the Barrhead area and Paisley suburbs in East Renfrewshire constituency

== New local government areas ==

Schedule I of the Act defined the new local government areas in terms of the existing districts and regions. Islands council areas had been unitary council areas since implementation of the 1973 Act, and Section 3 of the 1994 Act provided that the existing islands areas were to continue to be local government areas.

== Area councils ==
Each area established by the Act was to be governed by an elected council. The council&#x27;s title was simply the name of the area followed by the word &quot;Council&quot;: &quot;Argyll and Bute Council&quot;, &quot;Aberdeen City Council&quot; and so on. Each area was divided into wards with each ward returning a single councillor. The councillors were required to elect a convener, and could choose to elect a deputy convener. In the four city areas (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow) the convener&#x27;s title was to be Lord Provost. In the other council areas the convener was to be &quot;known by such title as the council may determine&quot;, other than Lord Provost. In 1998 sixteen councils were using the title &quot;provost&quot;, the remaining twelve having conveners.

Area councils were obliged to make a draft decentralisation scheme by 1 April 1997. The scheme could provide for:
* The holding of meetings of the council (or any committee or sub-committee) at particular places within the council area
* The establishment of committees for particular areas and the delegation to them of specified functions
* The location of council offices within the area
* The provision of facilities for accessing advice on council services at particular places within the council area
The plan was to include dates at which the various proposals were to be carried out. Having made the draft plan there was to be an eight-week period in which the area council was to consult with the relevant community councils and invite the public to make observations. The decentralisation scheme could then be adopted in original or modified form.

== Community councils ==
Community councils established by district councils under the 1973 Act were to continue to exist. The area councils took on the powers of the abolished districts to make or amend schemes for the establishment of communities.

== Water supply and sewerage ==
Part II of the Act reorganised water supply and sewerage services, previously the responsibility of regional councils. Three water authorities were established, each with a defined water area and sewerage area (which were not necessarily identical). The water and sewerage areas were defined in schedule 8, as follows:

The Act also established a Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers Council. The three water authorities were merged in 2002 to form Scottish Water.

== Other functions ==
The reorganisation of local government areas also led to changes in policing, fire services, public transport and tourism promotion. These had been organised in 1975 to correspond to one or more regions.
* The Police (Scotland) Act 1967 was amended to allow for the reconstitution of police areas and appointment of joint authorities.
* Similarly fire services and authorities were reconstituted.
* The Secretary of State for Scotland was to designate an area and constitution for the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority.
* Area Tourist Boards were to be established by the Secretary of State.
* Civic Licensing – the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 introduced a codified framework of regulation of activities such as taxis, street traders, public entertainment and so on. After the introduction of the 1994 Act, the &quot;licensing authority&quot; became the new unitary council for each area.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Water Conservators is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London.

In 1988, some members of the Select Society of Sanitary Sludge Shovelers (5S), who were also members of the Institution of Water and Environmental Management (IWEM; chartered in 1995, now CIWEM), founded the Guild of Water Conservators. It was recognised as a company in 1994. Its petition for livery was granted by the Court of Aldermen with effect from 2000. It received a Royal Charter in 2005.

The Water Conservators&#x27; Company ranks 102nd in the order of precedence of the City Livery Companies.

The supporters of the Company&#x27;s coat of arms consist of a beaver and an otter. Each of them is holding a golden shovel to recognise the part played by the British chapter of the 5S (whose badge is a golden shovel) in the formation of the guild.

The Company&#x27;s church is St Mary-at-Hill.

<text>The Academic Decathlon (also called AcDec, AcaDeca or AcaDec) is an annual high school academic competition organized by the non-profit United States Academic Decathlon (USAD). The competition consists of seven objective multiple choice tests, two subjective performance events, and an essay. Academic Decathlon was created by Robert Peterson in 1968 for local schools in Orange County, California, and was expanded nationally in 1981 by Robert Peterson, William Patton, first President of the new USAD Board; and Phillip Bardos, Chairman of the new USAD Board. That year, 17 states and the District of Columbia participated, a number that has grown to include most of the United States and some international schools. In 2015 Academic Decathlon held its first ever International competition in Shanghai, China. Once known as United States Academic Decathlon, on March 1, 2013, it began operating as the Academic Decathlon.

Academic Decathlon is designed to include students from all achievement levels. Teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on a custom calculated grade point average: Honors (3.8–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.20–3.79 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–3.19 GPA). Each team member competes in all ten events against other students in his or her division, and team scores are calculated using the top two overall individual scores from each team in all three divisions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores. To earn a spot at the national competition in April, teams must advance through local, regional, and state competitions, though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states. Online competitions, separated into small, medium, and large categories, are also offered. USAD has expanded to include an International Academic Decathlon and has created an Academic Pentathlon for middle schools.

The ten events require knowledge in art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science. These topics, with the exception of math, are thematically linked each year. One of the multiple choice events, alternating between science and social science, is chosen for the Super Quiz. In addition to the seven objective events, there are three subjective events graded by judges: essay, interview and speech.

Over the years, there have been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal involving the Steinmetz High School team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 Illinois state finals. This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film &quot;Cheaters&quot;. Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators for the amount of time it requires students to spend on the material, as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school. Around the turn of the millennium, several coaches protested the USAD&#x27;s decision to publish error-ridden &quot;Resource Guides&quot; rather than provide topics for students to research.

==History==
Academic Decathlon was founded in 1968 by Robert Peterson, the superintendent of schools in Orange County, California. Marvin Cobb, the executive director of the California Academic Decathlon in 2003, said after Peterson&#x27;s death that Peterson intended the competition to encourage not only the highest-level students who already competed in academic competitions (&quot;[adding] a little glory,&quot; as President of the Orange County Academic Decathlon Association put it in 1970), but also to &quot;change C students&#x27; lives&quot;. The inaugural competition, held in December 1968, hosted 103 students from 20 local high schools. At first only regional contests were held, organized by the Orange County Academic Decathlon Corporation (OCAD) with the assistance of the Orange County Department of Education. In 1971, when the grand jury recommended that the Orange County Department of Education should no longer play a part in the competition, full control was handed over to the OCAD.

In 1979, the first statewide competition was held, and just over two years later, the newly formed United States Academic Decathlon Association held the first national competition in April 1982 at Loyola Marymount University in California—200 high schools from 16 states and the District of Columbia competed for the chance to attend. Peterson, inspired by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event. At the 1984 Nationals, 32 states as well as Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea fielded teams. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. There was no more international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, only a handful of international schools have competed.

After a 1986 trial competition, Dr. Peterson founded a &quot;International Decathlon for Academics&quot; in 1990. Competitions were held in 1990, 1991 and 1992, but for a number of reasons the competition did not continue. In April 2009, USAD announced that it would be regularly hosting an online international competition, the International Academic Decathlon, after a successful trial event in 2008; however, all 2009 participants but Southbank opted out, leading USAD to issue Southbank an invitation to attend the 2009 U.S. National Competition instead.

Academic Decathlon was originally organized differently than the current competition. The original ten events were aesthetics (music and visual arts), conversation, essay writing, mathematics, practical arts, formal speech, physical science, social science, current events, extracurricular activities, and English literature, grammar, and reading. Over time, those events evolved into: economics, essay, fine arts, interview, language and literature, math, science, social sciences, speech and Super Quiz. It was not until 1998 that fine arts was split into its two constituent tests: art and music. Due to this division, the Super Quiz took the place of one of the other subjects each year. In 1998, Super Quiz replaced economics; from 1999 until 2012, it replaced either science or social science and alternated replacing the two from 2003 to 2012. Beginning with the 2013 season, the Super Quiz consisted of a relay portion only, encompassing questions from the respective year&#x27;s Science, Language and Literature, Music, Social Science, Art, and Economics curriculum.

More than just the events were changed during the 1998–99 season—the style of study required of students changed. Prior to that season, students had performed their own research for each event, and test writers did not have to base their questions on material USAD published. However, after a policy change at the beginning of the 1999–2000 competition year, test writers were required to base the tests on official USAD materials. After the change in policy, scores vastly increased across the country. That year at Nationals, James E. Taylor High School had the highest team score yet seen at the competition. The following season, USAD once again altered their testing policies; 50% of test questions were to come from USAD published &quot;Resource Guides&quot; and 50% were to come from unspecified sources. Economics focused on business organizations and profiles in individual enterprise rather than macroeconomics and microeconomics as it had for the previous 19 years. A decrease in scores followed these changes; the national winner that year, El Camino Real High School, scored 5,923 fewer points than James E. Taylor High School had the previous year. The following year, USAD settled on an organization of test materials that it would use for almost a full decade, with a mixture of questions from the provided material and independent research. A number of curriculum changes were reversed.

Though the events finally stabilized during the 2000–01 season, the USAD administration changed dramatically that year when the program&#x27;s executive director, James Alvino, resigned. Alvino had written a religious article that had been included in that year&#x27;s &quot;Super Quiz Resource Guide&quot;. His critics and the USAD Board regarded the inclusion as a conflict of interest, as the material was a persuasive essay that heavily pushed Alvino&#x27;s point of view. The season was also significant in that it was the first year that states were allowed to send both their large and small school champions to the national competition. (Small schools are currently classified as those schools with fewer than 650 students.) However, this practice was short-lived and was discontinued after the 2002 season. Instead, a small school e-Nationals was introduced during the 2005–06 school year. The medium school e-Nationals was established two years later for those schools with between 650 and 1,300 students. In 2010, California Academic Decathlon announced that a large school e-Nationals would be held for the second-highest performing school in each state.

In 2009, USAD announced the launch of an &quot;Online Middle School Pentathlon Program&quot;, a competition similar to Academic Decathlon, with only essay, language and literature, mathematics, geography or social science, and science as events. Either science or social science would be designated as the Super Quiz topic.

In 2010, it was announced that high school students who don&#x27;t have access to a school team or whose team has been eliminated in an earlier round can participate in an online individual competition.

==Participation==
===Team makeup and eligibility===
The USAD requires a diversity of achievement within each team; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by GPA. The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.80 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.20 and 3.799. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 3.19 (effective for the 2020-2021 competition year). USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value regardless of whether it is from an advanced placement, honors, regular or remedial class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.

A team typically consists of nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since only the top two scores from each category count towards the team&#x27;s total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally it is to the students&#x27; advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.

===Levels of competition===
There are four official levels of competition: local/scrimmage, regional, state, and national (Rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively). With the exception of Round 1, only the top finishers in each round advance to the next level. California, the state with the largest Academic Decathlon, holds local scrimmages using the Round 1 tests, which are largely for practice and do not determine whether a team can compete at the regional level, which uses Round 2 tests. In the 2008–09 season, 43 states participated in statewide Academic Decathlons, though only 35 and an international school participated in the national competition.

==Events==
Like an athletic decathlon, the Academic Decathlon has ten events: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, math, music, science, social science, and speech. Prior to 2013, the Super Quiz replaced one of the seven objective events each year; from 2003 to 2012, it alternated between replacing science and social science. USAD releases the topics and theme of the following year&#x27;s competition in early March, giving students time to prepare for a competition season that runs from November to April. The curriculum is developed by a ten-member panel of former USAD coaches known as the USAD Curriculum Advisory Group. The group contracts with &quot;curriculum developers&quot;, who must have at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree in their respective subject, to create the subject area outlines, &quot;Resource Guides&quot;, and Notebook Dividers. The &quot;Super Quiz Resource Guide&quot; was formed mostly from articles from peer reviewed journals, but also includes non-peer reviewed articles, which are looked over by a panel of five reviewers and then checked for accuracy by another reviewer. Use of this format was continued for the Science packet in the 2012–2013 season.

The events are split up into two groups: the seven objective tests (art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science) the three subjective events (essay, interview and speech). In addition, there is a Super Quiz relay event. The former seven are given as half-hour multiple choice tests, whereas the latter three are graded by judges. The multiple choice exams consist of 50 questions each, with the exception of math, which has 35 questions. Beginning in the 2012–2013 season, the Super Quiz written test was dropped and the oral relay was changed to include questions from six of the objective subjects: art, economics, language and literature, music, science, and social science.

===Objective events===
In general, the objective events follow a set organizational outline from year to year. Language and literature focuses on a single novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short literary selections which tend to be poems or excerpts from short stories. The art and music sections include several selections with which students must familiarize themselves in addition to historical information. Economics remains fairly static; 85% of the material focuses on a standard course of macroeconomics and microeconomics and the remaining 15% focuses on the year&#x27;s topic. For example, in 2005 the themed material covered the economics of ancient Egypt and Rome. Science and social science reflect the season&#x27;s theme. Unlike the other events, there is no basic information that carries over. The math curriculum has varied as well, occasionally dropping and adding new subjects or shifting the weight of particular subjects.

====Super Quiz====
The format of the Super Quiz differs from that of the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a culminating championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay around until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.

===Subjective events===
The subjective events allow students more creativity than the objective events. The speech event is divided into prepared and impromptu sections. A three-and-a-half to four-minute long prepared speech is delivered. The student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one-and-a-half to two-minute impromptu speech. Example prompts have included: &quot;It has been said about our modern times that, &#x27;Necessity is the mother of invention&#x27; Please discuss.&quot;, &quot;Math has been described as the universal language. Discuss.&quot; and &quot;Why is light, light and dark, dark?&quot; In the interview, the students are asked a wide variety of questions in a formal environment. Questions range from: &quot;Who is your role model?&quot; to &quot;How would you alert someone that their zipper is down?&quot; In both the speech and interview, the competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or hometown to ensure neutrality by the judges. In the essay event, students are given 50 minutes to write an essay responding to one of three prompts derived from the language and literature or the Super Quiz curriculum.

===Themes and topics===
As the competition has evolved, more of the events have been tied into a central theme. For example, the 2008–2009 theme was &quot;Latin America with a focus on Mexico&quot;. Language and literature was based on six short selections of literature as well as the novel &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; by Rudolfo Anaya. Art focused on the art of Mexico and featured several pieces of work, ranging from Olmec earthenware to José Guadalupe Posada&#x27;s &quot;La Calavera Catrina&quot;. The music event included questions on Latin American music and included works by musicians as varied as Manuel de Zumaya, Silvestre Revueltas, Ástor Piazzolla and Xavier Cugat. Social science and economics focused on the history and economy of Mexico respectively. The Super Quiz covered an introduction to evolutionary biology, the historical development of the theory of evolution, natural selection, speciation, mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and evolutionary developmental biology. Information was also included on Charles Darwin&#x27;s voyage aboard HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;.

==Study materials==
The United States Academic Decathlon publishes a variety of study materials for the objective events, the profits from which support the program. The &quot;Resource Guides&quot; and the &quot;Basic Guides&quot; constitute the majority of the USAD corpus. An art reproduction booklet and music CD contain a particular year&#x27;s relevant pieces and are issued separately from the &quot;Resource Guides&quot;. Study guides are also published and contain detailed topical outlines for each objective subject. These outlines specifically indicate which topics will require independent research beyond the material included in the &quot;Resource Guides&quot;. USAD also offered &quot;Research Guides&quot; until 2010, which outlined the basics of what students ought to research. However, in the 2010–2011 competition season, USAD announced that it would be eliminating independent research-based questions from the competitions.

&quot;Resource Guides&quot; are offered for the art, economics, language and literature, music, science/social science, and Super Quiz events. The &quot;Super Quiz Resource Guide&quot; is a compendium of previously published articles, whereas the other &quot;Resource Guides&quot; are composed by individual writers under contract with USAD. The aim of the &quot;Resource Guide&quot; is to assist students in their study of the topics listed in the subject area outlines. As an example, in 2003 the music topic was Romantic music. Subsequently, the &quot;Music Resource Guide&quot; focused on the development of Romantic music, its characteristics and the influence of the Classical era on the Romantic era. A large part of the guide focused on information about that year&#x27;s composers: Beethoven, Berlioz, Rossini, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Verdi, Mussorgsky, Wagner, Bizet, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Strauss. Similarly, the art topic assigned was Romantic art in the European tradition. The &quot;Art Resource Guide&quot; included sections detailing the lives and works of relevant artists such as Joseph Mallord William Turner, Claude Monet, Albert Bierstadt, and Camille Pissarro.

In the 1990s, various companies were established to research subjects and provide practice tests to teams. Two of the major ones were Acalon Cards and Exams and DemiDec, formed by former coach Dan Spetner and former Decathlete Daniel Berdichevsky, respectively. The two offer exams and study guides that can augment or replace USAD&#x27;s official materials. USAD explicitly discouraged teams from ordering materials from third-party companies in the late 1998, though it later removed their discouragement from the curriculum page. USAD republished their discouragement just a few weeks after removing it, but did not publish such a warning in 2002.

In 2000, several coaches who had led their teams to Nationals during the 1990s resigned in protest over Academic Decathlon&#x27;s decision to sell nearly $1,000 of study materials rather than simply providing topics for students to independently research. Teams felt obligated to buy the guides because USAD based the official tests on them. Teams also denounced the hundreds of errors they found in the official guides; coaches were sometimes forced to instruct their students to deliberately give the wrong answer in the official competition. Richard Golenko, coach of the 1996 J. Frank Dobie High School team that won the national competition, said that the decision to market guides shifted Academic Decathlon&#x27;s emphasis to memorization over critical thinking. Coach Jim Hatem of Los Angeles and Coach Mark Johnson of El Camino&#x27;s 1998 winning team fumed over esoteric &quot;trick&quot; questions that USAD had begun asking. James Alvino, USAD&#x27;s executive director at that time, argued that the expensive study materials were necessary to continue funding nearly 75% of the program&#x27;s $1,750,000 operating budget and to provide a fairer playing field for less wealthy schools, but did acknowledge that USAD would attempt to reduce prices, remove the more trivial questions, and base smaller portions of the tests on the official &quot;Resource Guide&quot;.

&quot;Basic Guides&quot; were formerly issued for students which, unlike the &quot;Resource Guides&quot;, remained the same from year to year. The &quot;Art Basic Guide&quot; focuses on art fundamentals, such as the elements of art, principles of composition, and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The &quot;Economics Basic Guide&quot; reviews fundamental economic concepts in addition to the basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics. The &quot;Language and Literature Basic Guide&quot; provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The &quot;Math Basic Guide&quot; offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The &quot;Music Basic Guide&quot; begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of fifths. It also includes information on a wide variety of instruments and a brief history of Western music. However, beginning in the 2010–2011 competition season, the &quot;Basic Guides&quot; were incorporated into the year&#x27;s &quot;Resource Guides&quot;.

The National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) has criticized the intense amount of studying required by students as &quot;excess fact-mongering&quot;. In the 1980s, the Association did not endorse Academic Decathlon, citing what it believes was an excessive amount of time involved with the studying necessary to win. It stated that while it is not opposed to the academic portion of the competition, it disliked the &quot;national dimension&quot; of it. However, beginning in 2008, the Association placed USAD on their &quot;National Advisory List of Student Contests and Activities&quot;. The list consists of programs that a NASSP committee believes meets their requisite quality standards.

==Scoring and winning==
Each of the ten events is worth 1,000 points, for a possible 10,000-point individual total. Only the top two scores from the Honors, Scholastic and Varsity divisions are counted for the team score. Until 2013, 60,000 was the maximum possible team score. In 2013, Super Quiz became a 10,000 point event that only counts for the team score, making the maximum possible team score 70,000. With the exception of math and Super Quiz, the objective tests each have 50 questions worth 20 points a piece. The math test is weighted more heavily, with 35 questions worth approximately 28.6 points per question. Until 2013, the Super Quiz written test contained 40 questions, each worth 15 points. Depending on the state director, the relay component of Super Quiz contained either 5 or 10 questions, each worth 80 or 40 points respectively. Starting in 2013, the Super Quiz contained only the relay component with 5 or 10 questions, each worth approximately 333.3 or 166.7 points respectively. The written test was sometimes omitted at the state level even before 2013 if a state director wished to weigh the Super Quiz Relay more heavily. Perfect scores of 1,000 in events are recorded regularly, and there have been cases of dozens of medal winners for a single event because of perfect and near-perfect scores. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded in each event and for each division (Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity). All tying participants are awarded medals.

The medals&#x27; design is the &quot;AD&quot; portion of the official USAD logo, encircled by &quot;United States&quot; at the top, &quot;Academic Decathlon&quot; at the bottom, and four stars of increasing size on either side. Though the medals are given out only to winners of the competitions, teams can order them along with other study materials. The medals given at state and local competitions are of a different design than those given at Nationals.

The interview and speech events are graded by two to three judges. The scores from the judges are averaged to give a maximum of 1,000 points per event. The essay is graded with a rubric and is read by two different judges whose scores are then averaged. If the difference between the judges&#x27; scores differs by 200 points or more, then a third reader is asked to grade the student&#x27;s essay. The two scores that are closest in value are averaged to give the final score.

A benchmark for the Decathlon elite is obtaining an individual score of over 9,000 points. It was not until 1992, 24 years after the program&#x27;s inception, that Tyson Rogers achieved this feat at the national competition. Since then, numerous students have broken the 9,000 point barrier. The current highest individual score is 9,707.9, achieved by Hannah Lee from Wakeland High School at the 2019 Texas state competition. State champion scores vary greatly from year to year. As an example, for the 2002–03 season, scores ranged from 24,785 to 49,910 points. National champion scores have been as low as 45,857.0 points and as high as 54,531.2 points. The 54,531.2 score produced by the 2018 El Camino Real Charter High School team at the National Championship stands as the record for the highest team score.

===Controversies===
Three days before the 1995 Illinois state competition, Steinmetz High School obtained copies of the tests from the DeVry Institute of Technology, where the state finals were being held. The team was therefore able to look up and memorize the answers. The cheating allowed Steinmetz to beat perennial powerhouse Whitney Young Magnet High School, who had won the Illinois state finals in 22 of the previous 23 years. Six of the twelve students in the nation who scored over 900 points on the math test came from Steinmetz High School, prompting the Illinois state Academic Decathlon to suspect cheating. The Steinmetz team was disqualified after team members refused to take an alternate version of the test, and its coach eventually resigned. The incident was dramatized in the movie &quot;Cheaters&quot;.

Catholic Memorial High School coach John Burke was at the center of a dispute over the results of the 2003 Wisconsin state final. Confusion arose over a Catholic Memorial student&#x27;s essay after the results of the competition were released. The essay had only received 390 points out of a possible 1000, and Burke contended that it had been scored improperly. He was well within his rights to contest the score; however, Gerhard Fischer, President of Wisconsin Academic Decathlon, said that the way Burke handled the appeal was &quot;highly questionable&quot; and inflammatory. Though Burke was reprimanded, parents of Catholic Memorial students believed the punishment, a three-year suspension for Burke and a one-year suspension for Catholic Memorial, was due to personality differences between Burke and Wisconsin Academic Decathlon officials. The controversy eventually led to a more thorough investigation of previous issues involving Burke. The Wisconsin Academic Decathlon Board discovered that Burke had previously been accused of &quot;[m]ore than a year of repeated &#x27;attacks&#x27; on another school&#x27;s pupils, including allegations of cheating on tests and ineligibility.&quot;

==National championship==

The National Championship pits the winning school from each state against all the others for an overall title. Occasionally, a number of international schools compete as well. Schools compete based on size and are divided into three divisions (I, II, III, and IV). However, this separation is limited to overall team score and overall individual score. Nine overall team medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for each division. Similarly, 27 overall individual medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for Honors, Scholastic and Varsity in each division. The top prepared speeches are honored at the Speech Showcase, while the rest of the medals—for example, gold in art for Honors, or silver in math for Varsity—are awarded to the top scoring persons during the awards banquet regardless of division. Other awards given out include the Kristin Caperton Award for overcoming personal or physical challenges, among others. Certain awards occasionally come with monetary prizes; these often vary from year to year. Since the first national event in 1982, all National Championship winners have come from three states: California, Texas and Wisconsin. As of 2024, El Camino Real Charter High School has won 10 national titles.

===Virtual competition===
In 2006, the small school virtual competition was created for schools with 650 or fewer students. Two years later, the medium school virtual competition was added to accommodate schools with a student population between 650 and 1,300. These two separate contests are held via the Internet and, as such, the interview and speech events are excluded. The remaining eight tests are completed on the computer and results are submitted electronically to USAD for scoring. Because only the seven multiple choice tests and essay are used, team scores are out of 48,000 points instead of 60,000. Although it is only a virtual competition, winning schools are awarded trophies and medals for their efforts. University High School, from Fresno, California, has won 6 of 7 Small School National Championships. Coached by Sean Canfield, the team has won both the California and National Small School titles for the past 6 years. UHS has a current enrollment of 465 students, yet placed eighth overall at the 2013 California State, competing against schools several times its size. According to USAD, the goal of the small and medium school competitions is to &quot;enhance learning, growth and recognition&quot;. In 2010, the United States Academic Decathlon announced the beginning of a large school e-Nationals for the second-highest performing large school in each state.

<doc id="562046" wikidata="Q3785000" url="?curid=562046" title="Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort">
<text>Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort (16 October 1744 – 11 October 1803) was an English courtier and politician. He was styled the Marquess of Worcester from 1745 until 1756, when he succeeded his father as 5th Duke of Beaufort, 7th Marquess of Worcester, 11th Earl of Worcester, and 13th Baron Herbert.

==Early life==
Somerset was born on 16 October 1744 at Brook Street, Hanover Square, London. He was the only son of Lord Charles Somerset (second son of the 2nd Duke of Beaufort) and Elizabeth Beaufort, daughter of John Symes Berkeley.

At the time of Somerset&#x27;s birth, his father sat in the House of Commons. He was five months old when his father succeeded his elder brother 3rd Duke of Beaufort in the dukedom, at which point Somerset was styled by his father&#x27;s subsidiary title, the Marquess of Worcester. The 3rd Duke left only an illegitimate daughter, Margaret Burr, who married the artist Thomas Gainsborough.

In October 1765, shortly after his 21st birthday, he succeeded his father as the 5th Duke of Beaufort. On 18 October 1760, Beaufort began his studies at Oriel College, Oxford, graduating on 7 July 1763 with a Doctor of Civil Laws (DCL) degree.

==Career==
Beaufort held the office of Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England between 1767 and 1772. From 1768 to 1770, he was Master of the Horse to Queen Charlotte. He was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Monmouthshire in 1771 and Lord-Lieutenant of Brecknockshire in 1787, holding both offices until his death in 1803, as well as that of Lord-Lieutenant of Leicestershire from 1787 to 1799. He was appointed Colonel of the Monmouthshire Militia on 23 December 1771 and assumed command of the Monmouth and Brecon Militia when the combined regiment was embodied on 1 February 1793. He remained in command until his death.

He was invested as a Knight of the Order of the Garter (KG) on 2 June 1786. On 4 June 1803, shortly before his death, he succeeded to the title of 5th Baron Botetourt.

==Personal life==

On 2 January 1766, he married Elizabeth Boscawen, daughter of Hon. Edward Boscawen, Admiral of the Blue, and sister to George Boscawen, 3rd Viscount Falmouth. Elizabeth died 15 June 1828. Together they had four daughters and nine sons:

# Lord Arthur John Henry Somerset (1780–1816), who married Hon. Elizabeth Boscawen, daughter of George Boscawen, 3rd Viscount Falmouth, in 1808.
# Rev. Lord William Somerset (1784–1861), who married Elizabeth Molyneux, daughter of Lt.-Gen. Sir Thomas Molyneux, 5th Baronet, in 1813. After her death in 1843, the following year he married Frances Westby Brady, daughter of Henry Brady of Raheen Manor, County Clare, and widow of Cornelius O&#x27;Callaghan of Ballynahinch (died 1829).
# Lady Anne Elizabeth Somerset (1786–1803), who died unmarried.
# Col. Lord John Thomas Henry Somerset (1787–1846), who married Lady Catherine Annesley, daughter of Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Mountnorris and Hon. Sarah Cavendish (a daughter of Sir Henry Cavendish, 2nd Baronet and the 1st Baroness Waterpark), in 1814.
# FitzRoy James Henry Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan (1788–1855), who married Lady Emily Wellesley-Pole, daughter of William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington, in 1814.

Lord Beaufort died on 11 October 1803 and was buried at St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton. His last will was dated from 21 June 1789 to 11 September 1800. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Henry

===Relation to Richard III===

Beaufort and Richard III were both male-line descendants of the Plantagenet King Edward III: Beaufort through Edward&#x27;s fourth son, John of Gaunt, and Richard through Edward&#x27;s fifth son, Edmund of Langley. After the exhumation of Richard III in 2012, intensive research was conducted using the DNA of descendants of the immediate relatives of Richard, who died without issue. The body exhumed was positively identified by matching his mitochondrial DNA with two living descendants of his eldest sister, Anne of York).

All five known living male-line relatives of Richard are descended from the 5th Duke of Beaufort; however, a Y chromosome type of Richard failed to match any of the five, indicating that at least one non-paternity event had occurred somewhere in the 19 generations between Richard and the 5th Duke. Four of the five, however, had DNA indicating they held Plantagenet ancestry through different ancestors. The fifth was not related at all, indicating an additional non-paternity event had occurred in the 5th Duke&#x27;s male line in recent generations.

<doc id="562053" wikidata="Q967278" url="?curid=562053" title="New Democracy (Sweden)">
<text>New Democracy (, NyD) was a political party in Sweden. It was founded in 1991 and elected into the Riksdag in the 1991 Swedish general election. It lost all its seats in the Riksdag in the subsequent election in 1994, and its subsequent decline culminated in bankruptcy in February 2000, at which time it retained only one city council post. Local factions of New Democracy reformed into minor parties such as Sjöbopartiet, which experienced mixed success.

New Democracy campaigned on an agenda of reform and restricted immigration, initially on economic rather than cultural grounds. Its economic policy, stressing the importance of entrepreneurship and deregulation, was generally perceived as right-wing. The party favored Swedish application for European Union membership, which was attained in 1995. It also called for wide-scale political reform, including cutting government departments, reducing the Riksdag to 151 members and electing Prime Minister by direct ballot.

These years were the only time a right-wing populist party had been represented in the Riksdag until the election of members of the Sweden Democrats in September 2010.

==History==

===Foundation===

Before New Democracy was formed, both founders Bert Karlsson and Ian Wachtmeister were well known in Sweden as charismatic public figures; Karlsson a self-made man, founder, owner and manager of both a record company and an amusement park; and Count Wachtmeister, a businessman from a highly esteemed aristocratic family. They had also been noted for some limited non-partisan political activity. They had planned starting a party for a short time, as they met for the first time in mid-November 1990 in a café at the Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, waiting for a flight. There, they discussed the matter after Wachtmeister had read in &quot;Expressen&quot; that Karlsson had &quot;appointed&quot; him prime minister in his dream-team government. Appearing on television on 23 November, a specially commissioned &quot;Sifo&quot; poll was announced where 23% of voters had responded that they could imagine voting for &quot;Bert Karlsson&#x27;s party&quot;. Thus, the party had been secured popular support as well as media attention already before it had been formed.

Karlsson and Wachtmeister announced the formation of their new party in an article in &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; on 25 November 1990, titled &quot;Here is our party program&quot; (&quot;Här är vårt partiprogram&quot;). The party was given the name New Democracy on 1 December 1990, and was formally founded at a meeting in Skara on 4 February 1991 after having collected the required number of signatures for official registration. A few days after the party was launched, the party received 11.7% support in an opinion poll in &quot;Dagens Industri&quot; (which apparently had been manipulated by Karlsson), and again the same in a poll in March by &quot;Sifo&quot;. It held its first party conference on 1–2 June the same year. The first big setback for the party came when Karlsson appeared on the television program &quot;Magasinet&quot;. During the show, he was incapable of answering the occasional complex political questions thrown at him by the host, and failed to explain how they sought to implement the party&#x27;s political program. Karlsson in turn soon resigned as party leader.

===In the Riksdag (1991–1994)===
The party ran an election-show which was totally unconventional in Swedish politics. Wachtmeister and Karlsson for instance became known for illustrating their economic arguments by piling up empty beer crates. They popularly became known as &quot;The Count and the Valet&quot;, noting their contrasting backgrounds. In the summer of 1991, some opinion polls showed more than 10% support for the party. During an election-night television program, Bengt Westerberg, leader of the Liberal People&#x27;s Party, left the studio in protest against New Democracy&#x27;s immigration policy. Alf Svensson of the Christian Democrats and Olof Johansson of the Centre Party followed shortly after. In the 1991 general election, the party won 6.7% of the vote and 25 seats. In the Riksdag, New Democracy abstained from voting on the office of Prime Minister, and thus gave the four-party liberal-conservative government led by Carl Bildt its indirect support.

While Karlsson would appear in the chamber in inappropriate attire, Wachtmeister engaged more willfully in politics. The two, however, soon fell out, likely due to their contradictory perspectives. By 1992, it became more clear that the party chose to campaign on a line of criticism of immigration; for instance demanding a decreased foreign aid, expulsion of immigrants committing crime, loans rather than grants and temporary residence permits instead of asylum. The party also started to disintegrate as a result of defections from the parliamentary group, exclusions, peculiar statements in the media, scandals and internal strife. In the summer of 1993, the party&#x27;s rising star Vivianne Franzén started to talk about immigrant rape and Muslim ritual murders.

By October 1993, the division between Karlsson and Wachtmeister became clearer, while the party&#x27;s support had fallen to around 4.4%. When Wachtmeister stepped down as chairman in February 1994, he was followed by an almost unprecedented power struggle. While Wachtmeister launched Sten Dybeck as a new chairman, Karlsson proposed Pelle Svensson and Carl Hamilton. In April, Harriet Colliander was chosen as new chairman instead, just to be followed by Wachtmeister&#x27;s new candidate Vivianne Franzén in June. As the party had depended heavily on its two founders, it began to implode immediately after they started to disagree. In early 1994, the party started to initiate cooperation with parties such as the Sweden Democrats, the Sjöbo Party and the Centre Democrats.

===Downfall (1994–2000)===
By the next election, the party had largely become the subject of ridicule. The 1994 general election became a huge failure for the party, as it received only 1.4% of the vote and lost all its seats. The municipal elections also saw its local support shredded, where its former 335 representatives dropped to 53. Already before the election, many local chapters of the party had broken out from the party, and established new local parties. The organization became marked by internal power struggles over the control of party funds, and it quickly fell into dismay (at least at a national level). Bert Karlsson established the local party Skara Future (&quot;Skara Framtid&quot;) in 1995, and Ian Wachtmeister went on to found a party called the New Party (&quot;Det Nya Partiet&quot;) for the 1998 elections. Burned by the experience of New Democracy, Wachtmeister hand-picked the board, and the party did not have any conventions or accept any members. The party failed to attract enough votes for representation in the Riksdag and was dissolved.

The 1998 elections saw New Democracy losing all but one of its municipal representatives. The party ceased to exist when it was declared bankrupt on 25 February 2000. Laholm city council representative Elver Åkesson retained his seat until the 2002 elections, the last active member of the party to hold office. &quot;New Democracy&quot; was founded again in April 2002 under a new organisational registration, and attempted to run for the 2002 elections, but received a mere 106 votes nationwide. The party&#x27;s website was shut down in March 2005.

==Ideology==

Unlike other right-wing populist parties, New Democracy saw economic issues as superior and more important than cultural issues. In its introduction, the party program asserted that it would always base its policies on common sense, personal liberty and consideration for others. The 1991 election survey found that the party&#x27;s voters was motivated foremost by its position on immigration issues and its economic policy, two issues that were growing in importance at the time. In addition, twice as many people as actually voted for the party, nevertheless approved of its asylum policies.

===Taxes===
The party set out a plan to reduce the overall taxation in Sweden from 57% (which it was in 1989), to 47% within six years, as it cited the average overall taxation in the OECD countries to be 37% the same time. It sought to reduce public expenses, sell state-owned properties and abolish state monopolies. The party competed with the Moderate Party on how steep tax cuts should be, and sought to &quot;outbid&quot; them.

===Foreign policy===
The party saw it as &quot;obvious&quot; for Sweden to join the European Union, and wanted to relinquish Sweden&#x27;s policy of neutrality. It wanted Sweden&#x27;s foreign policy to mainly concern itself with relations with Sweden&#x27;s &quot;real neighbours,&quot; which it regarded to be; Denmark, Finland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Poland and Russia, as well as its trading partners in Europe and North America. It also wanted to stop foreign aid to oppressive regimes, particularly socialist ones, and instead give aid for humanitarian efforts and emergency aid, as it wanted to &quot;help people, not governments.&quot;

===Law and order===
The party wanted to invest heavily in the fight against drug abuse and street violence, and impose severe penalties for what it called related &quot;gangster activity.&quot; It wanted to implement harder punishments for violent crime, and life imprisonment for the most dangerous criminals.

===Immigration===
The party&#x27;s anti-immigration stance was largely argued on economic terms, most often by comparing immigration costs and tax-cuts, although welfare chauvinism also sometimes was an element. The party wanted to introduce temporary residence permits for refugees, and that those who were allowed to stay should immediately be assimilated into Swedish society. It wished to set refugees to work, rather than in camps, and to reject foreign citizens who committed serious crimes. Compared to other right-wing populist parties, issues of culture and ethnicity were heavily downplayed.

Although downplayed, in a 1991 interview Wachtmeister accused African refugees of having introduced AIDS to Sweden, and expressed displeasure about the lower share of &quot;ethnic citizens&quot; (ethnic Swedes) compared to other Western countries. The party&#x27;s anti-immigration stance escalated during its term in the Riksdag. In the party&#x27;s 1993 summer camp, Vivianne Franzén (who became party leader in 1994) described a murder committed by a mentally ill immigrant as a Muslim ritual murder, and also warned that Swedish school children soon would have to turn towards Mecca.

==International relations==
Although typically compared to the parties, New Democracy officially distanced itself from both the right-wing populist Danish Progress Party and the Norwegian Progress Party.

<text>The Diablerets (; lit. &quot;the abode of devils&quot;) are a huge ice-covered mountain massif of the Alps, culminating at the Sommet des Diablerets (VS) at above sea level and almost straddling the border between the Swiss cantons of Vaud (VD) and Valais (VS). The northeastern part of the massif stretches also into the canton of Bern (BE).

The Diablerets massif, which consists of several peaks, extends for about 10 kilometres near the western extremity of the Bernese Alps, between the two deep passes, the Cheville Pass () right below the main summit to the south, and the Sanetsch/Sénin Pass () to the east. The mountain is covered by two distinct glaciers, the largest being the Tsanfleuron Glacier and the highest being the Diablerets Glacier.

The main summit (officially referred to as &quot;Sommet des Diablerets&quot;) is the highest point in the massif and the sud-west summit is the highest point in the canton of Vaud. In the latter canton, the mountain has given its name to the nearby village and resort of Les Diablerets, which lies on the north side of the massif. On the south side (Valais) the mountain overlooks the hamlet and valley of Derborence.

==Description==
Along with the Muverans, the Wildhorn and the Wildstrubel, the Diablerets are one of the four distinct and glaciated massifs of the Bernese Alps that lie between the Rhone elbow and the Gemmi Pass. The main section of the mountain, between the cantons of Vaud and Valais, is part of the Rhone basin, through the rivers Grande Eau (north) and Lizerne (south). The easternmost part of the massif, that lies in the canton of Bern, is part of the Rhine basin, through the river Sarine (French, &quot;Saane&quot; in German). The Oldehore (Swiss German, Germanized: &quot;Oldenhorn&quot;) is the tripoint of the three cantons of Vaud, Valais and Bern, and several of the peaks have a German as well as a French name.

The main peaks of the massif are, from west to east: the Culan (VD, ) at the western end of the massif, the Tête Ronde (VD, ) approximately 800 meters west of the main summit, the &quot;Sommet des Diablerets&quot; (main summit), Le Dôme (VS, ) east of the main summit and between the two glaciers, the Sex Rouge (also called Scex Rouge; VD, ) and the Oldehorn/Becca d&#x27;Audon (VD, BE, VS; ) across the Tsanfleuron Glacier, and the Sentschore/Mont Brun (BE, VS; ) further to the northeast. Also notable is the tower-like peak of the Quille du Diable (&quot;devil&#x27;s skittle,&quot; also known as Tour St-Martin; VS, ) that overlooks Derborence from the edge of the Tsanfleuron plateau.

The two largest glaciers on the massif (Tsanfleuron and Diablerets) are both on the Valais side. They form a single inclined plane towards the east, although they are separated by the rocky summit of Le Dôme (2,986 m), which lies just east of the main summit. They are not very steep, especially the Tsanfleuron Glacier, as the rock strata are close to horizontal. The smaller and higher Diablerets Glacier, however, is much wilder than the Tsanfleuron Glacier as it is steeper and more crevassed. The Tsanfleuron plateau, between Le Dôme and the Sanetsch Pass is only partly glaciated. Below 2,600 m is a large karst zone, called Lapis de Tsanfleuron and covering an area of about .

Along with the Culan, the Tête Ronde, and the Scex Rouge, the main summit forms an amphitheatre of limestone cliffs with numerous water falls, surrounding the valley of Creux de Champ and overlooking the village of Les Diablerets from a height of over 2,000 metres. The height of the north wall is about 1,600 metres, its bottom (named &quot;Rochers de Champ&quot;) lying at 1,600 metres.

As with other mountains on the crest of the Bernese Alps, the slopes of the Diablerets experience different types of climate depending on their location: the northern slopes are cooler and wetter while the southern slopes are drier and warmer. Forests are found up to 1,900 metres on the north side and up to 2,000 metres on the south side. Further south in Valais, on the slopes of Mont Gond, vineyards are also very common below 1000 metres, but completely absent on the north side. There, alpine pastures dominate the landscape, as in many other areas of the northern Alpine foothills.

==Tourism and climbing==
Since 1964, an aerial tramway connects the Scex Rouge from the Col du Pillon, 4 kilometres east of the village of Les Diablerets. The Tsanfleuron Glacier, easily accessible from the Scex Rouge mountain station, has then become part of a large ski area with several ski lifts on it, culminating at nearly 3,000 metres, that goes by the commercial name of Glacier 3000. The area is also popular in summer for the snow hikes on the glacier. The summits of Le Dôme and Oldenhorn can be reached in a few hours from the station. The Peak Walk, a 107 m suspension bridge to Scex Rouge from the peak at the top of the lift station, was constructed as a tourist attraction in 2014.

The main summit, although not very distant from the Scex Rouge station, can not be easily reached as it involves the crossing of the much-crevassed Diablerets Glacier, though it is accessible to more intrepid hikers.

Administratively, &quot;le Sommet des Diablerets&quot; is shared between the municipalities of Conthey (VS), Ormont-Dessus and Bex (VD).

<doc id="562057" wikidata="Q2183379" url="?curid=562057" title="Feeler (Pete Murray album)">
<text>Feeler is the second studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Pete Murray. Released on 21 July 2003, the album peaked at number one on the Australian charts.

==Background==
In 2001, Pete Murray released an independent album &quot;The Game&quot; which prompted Sony Music Australia to sign him. 

In early 2003, Pete Murray and his band entered the studio with producer Paul McKercher and his band to make the &quot;Feeler&quot; album. On his website, Pete Murray outlines the type of record he was hoping to make. &quot;The records I love by people like Nick Drake, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, they are built to last. I wanted this to be an album like that, something you can pull out in 30 years and still hear the feeling in it, rather than something that&#x27;s dated by the musical fashions of the day.&quot;

<text>In computer science, comparator networks are abstract devices built up of a fixed number of &quot;wires&quot;, carrying values, and comparator modules that connect pairs of wires, swapping the values on the wires if they are not in a desired order. Such networks are typically designed to perform sorting on fixed numbers of values, in which case they are called sorting networks.

Sorting networks differ from general comparison sorts in that they are not capable of handling arbitrarily large inputs, and in that their sequence of comparisons is set in advance, regardless of the outcome of previous comparisons. In order to sort larger amounts of inputs, new sorting networks must be constructed. This independence of comparison sequences is useful for parallel execution and for implementation in hardware. Despite the simplicity of sorting nets, their theory is surprisingly deep and complex. Sorting networks were first studied circa 1954 by Armstrong, Nelson and O&#x27;Connor, who subsequently patented the idea.

Sorting networks can be implemented either in hardware or in software. Donald Knuth describes how the comparators for binary integers can be implemented as simple, three-state electronic devices. Batcher, in 1968, suggested using them to construct switching networks for computer hardware, replacing both buses and the faster, but more expensive, crossbar switches. Since the 2000s, sorting nets (especially bitonic mergesort) are used by the GPGPU community for constructing sorting algorithms to run on graphics processing units.

==Introduction==

A sorting network consists of two types of items: comparators and wires. The wires are thought of as running from left to right, carrying values (one per wire) that traverse the network all at the same time. Each comparator connects two wires. When a pair of values, traveling through a pair of wires, encounter a comparator, the comparator swaps the values if and only if the top wire&#x27;s value is greater or equal to the bottom wire&#x27;s value.

In a formula, if the top wire carries and the bottom wire carries , then after hitting a comparator the wires carry formula_1 and formula_2, respectively, so the pair of values is sorted. A network of wires and comparators that will correctly sort all possible inputs into ascending order is called a sorting network or Kruskal hub. By reflecting the network, it is also possible to sort all inputs into descending order.

The full operation of a simple sorting network is shown below. It is evident why this sorting network will correctly sort the inputs; note that the first four comparators will &quot;sink&quot; the largest value to the bottom and &quot;float&quot; the smallest value to the top. The final comparator sorts out the middle two wires.

===Depth and efficiency===
The efficiency of a sorting network can be measured by its total size, meaning the number of comparators in the network, or by its &quot;depth&quot;, defined (informally) as the largest number of comparators that any input value can encounter on its way through the network. Noting that sorting networks can perform certain comparisons in parallel (represented in the graphical notation by comparators that lie on the same vertical line), and assuming all comparisons to take unit time, it can be seen that the depth of the network is equal to the number of time steps required to execute it.

=== Insertion and Bubble networks ===
We can easily construct a network of any size recursively using the principles of insertion and selection. Assuming we have a sorting network of size &quot;n&quot;, we can construct a network of size by &quot;inserting&quot; an additional number into the already sorted subnet (using the principle underlying insertion sort). We can also accomplish the same thing by first &quot;selecting&quot; the lowest value from the inputs and then sort the remaining values recursively (using the principle underlying bubble sort).
The structure of these two sorting networks are very similar. A construction of the two different variants, which collapses together comparators that can be performed simultaneously shows that, in fact, they are identical. 
The insertion network (or equivalently, bubble network) has a depth of , where is the number of values. This is better than the time needed by random-access machines, but it turns out that there are much more efficient sorting networks with a depth of just , as described below.

===Zero-one principle===

While it is easy to prove the validity of some sorting networks (like the insertion/bubble sorter), it is not always so easy. There are permutations of numbers in an -wire network, and to test all of them would take a significant amount of time, especially when is large. The number of test cases can be reduced significantly, to , using the so-called zero-one principle. While still exponential, this is smaller than for all , and the difference grows quite quickly with increasing .

The zero-one principle states that, if a sorting network can correctly sort all sequences of zeros and ones, then it is also valid for arbitrary ordered inputs. This not only drastically cuts down on the number of tests needed to ascertain the validity of a network, it is of great use in creating many constructions of sorting networks as well.

The principle can be proven by first observing the following fact about comparators: when a monotonically increasing function is applied to the inputs, i.e., and are replaced by and , then the comparator produces and . By induction on the depth of the network, this result can be extended to a lemma stating that if the network transforms the sequence into , it will transform into . Suppose that some input contains two items , and the network incorrectly swaps these in the output. Then it will also incorrectly sort for the function

:formula_3

This function is monotonic, so we have the zero-one principle as the contrapositive.

==Constructing sorting networks==
Various algorithms exist to construct sorting networks of depth (hence size ) such as Batcher odd–even mergesort, bitonic sort, Shell sort, and the Pairwise sorting network. These networks are often used in practice.

It is also possible to construct networks of depth (hence size ) using a construction called the &quot;AKS network&quot;, after its discoverers Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi. While an important theoretical discovery, the AKS network has very limited practical application because of the large linear constant hidden by the Big-O notation. These are partly due to a construction of an expander graph.

A simplified version of the AKS network was described by Paterson in 1990, who noted that &quot;the constants obtained for the depth bound still prevent the construction being of practical value&quot;.

A more recent construction called the &quot;zig-zag sorting network&quot; of size was discovered by Goodrich in 2014. While its size is much smaller than that of AKS networks, its depth makes it unsuitable for a parallel implementation.

===Optimal sorting networks===
For small, fixed numbers of inputs , &quot;optimal&quot; sorting networks can be constructed, with either minimal depth (for maximally parallel execution) or minimal size (number of comparators). These networks can be used to increase the performance of larger sorting networks resulting from the recursive constructions of, e.g., Batcher, by halting the recursion early and inserting optimal nets as base cases. The following table summarizes the optimality results for small networks for which the optimal depth is known:

For larger networks neither the optimal depth nor the optimal size are currently known. The bounds known so far are provided in the table below:

The first sixteen depth-optimal networks are listed in Knuth&#x27;s &quot;Art of Computer Programming&quot;, and have been since the 1973 edition; however, while the optimality of the first eight was established by Floyd and Knuth in the 1960s, this property wasn&#x27;t proven for the final six until 2014 (the cases nine and ten having been decided in 1991).

For one to twelve inputs, minimal (i.e. size-optimal) sorting networks are known, and for higher values, lower bounds on their sizes can be derived inductively using a lemma due to Van Voorhis (p. 240): . The first ten optimal networks have been known since 1969, with the first eight again being known as optimal since the work of Floyd and Knuth, but optimality of the cases and took until 2014 to be resolved.
The optimality of the smallest known sorting networks for and was resolved in 2020.

Some work in designing optimal sorting network has been done using genetic algorithms: D. Knuth mentions that the &quot;smallest&quot; known sorting network for was found by Hugues Juillé in 1995 &quot;by simulating an evolutionary process of genetic breeding&quot; (p. 226), and that the &quot;minimum depth&quot; sorting networks for and were found by Loren Schwiebert in 2001 &quot;using genetic methods&quot; (p. 229).

===Complexity of testing sorting networks===

Unless P=NP, the problem of testing whether a candidate network is a sorting network is likely to remain difficult for networks of large sizes, due to the problem being co-NP-complete.

<text>The Tosafot, Tosafos or Tosfot () are medieval commentaries on the Talmud. They take the form of critical and explanatory glosses, printed, in almost all Talmud editions, on the outer margin and opposite Rashi&#x27;s notes.

The authors of the Tosafot are known as Tosafists; for a listing (see List of Tosafists.)

==Meaning of name==
The word &quot;tosafot&quot; literally means &quot;additions&quot;. The reason for the title is a matter of dispute among modern scholars.

Many of them, including Heinrich Graetz, think the glosses are so-called as additions to Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Talmud. In fact, the period of the Tosafot began immediately after Rashi had written his commentary; the first tosafists were Rashi&#x27;s sons-in-law and grandsons, and the Tosafot consist mainly of strictures on Rashi&#x27;s commentary.

Others, especially Isaac Hirsch Weiss, object that many tosafot — particularly those of Isaiah di Trani — have no reference to Rashi. Weiss, followed by other scholars, asserts that &quot;tosafot&quot; means additions to &quot;the Talmud&quot;, that is to say, they are an extension and development of the Talmud. For just as the Gemara is a critical and analytical commentary on the Mishnah, so are the Tosafot critical and analytical glosses on those two parts of the Talmud. Further, the term &quot;tosafot&quot; was not applied for the first time to the glosses of Rashi&#x27;s continuators, but to the Tosefta, the additions to the Mishnah compiled by Judah ha-Nasi I. &quot;Tosefta&quot; is a Babylonian term, which in Jerusalem writings is replaced by &quot;tosafot&quot;. The Tosafot resemble the Gemara in other respects also, for just as the latter is the work of different schools carried on through a long period, so the former were written at different times and by different schools, and gathered later into one body.

==Character==
Up to and including Rashi, the Talmudic commentators occupied themselves only with the plain meaning (&quot;peshaṭ&quot;) of the text; but after the beginning of the twelfth century the spirit of criticism took possession of the teachers of the Talmud. Thus some of Rashi&#x27;s continuators, as his sons-in-law and his grandson Samuel ben Meïr (RaSHBaM), while they wrote commentaries on the Talmud after the manner of Rashi&#x27;s, wrote also glosses on it in a style peculiar to themselves.

The Tosafot do not constitute a continuous commentary, but rather (like the &quot;Dissensiones&quot; to the Roman Code of the first quarter of the twelfth century) deal only with difficult passages of the Talmud. Single sentences are explained by quotations which are taken from other Talmudic treatises and which seem at first glance to have no connection with the sentences in question. On the other hand, sentences which seem to be related and interdependent are separated and embodied in different treatises. The Tosafot can be understood only by those who are well advanced in the study of the Talmud, for the most entangled discussions are treated as though they were simple. Glosses explaining the meaning of a word or containing a grammatical observation are very rare.

The Tosafot may be considered from the point of view of a methodology of the Talmud. The rules are certainly not gathered together in one series, as they are, for instance, in Maimonides&#x27; introduction to the Mishnah; they are scattered in various parts, and their number is quite considerable. Neither are they stated in fixed terms; a generally accepted rule is followed by &quot;This is the way of the Talmud&quot; or &quot;The Talmud usually declares.&quot; Sometimes the negative expression is found, &quot;This is not the way of the Talmud.&quot; A frequently recurring rule is indicated by some such formula as &quot;We find many like this.&quot;

The above description concerns the general features of the Tosafot; nevertheless, the writings of different tosafists differ somewhat in style and method. With regard to method, it should be said that the Tosafot of Touques (see below) concern particularly the casuistic interpretation of the traditional law, but do not touch halakhic decisions.

In spite of the great respect in which Rashi was held by the Tosafists, the latter freely disputed his explanations;

==History==

The chief home of tosafot literature was 11th century France. It began with Rashi&#x27;s pupils, and was continued mainly by the heads of the French schools. While tosafot began to be written in Germany at the same time as in France, the French tosafists always predominated numerically. The first tosafot recorded are those written by Rashi&#x27;s two sons-in-law, Meïr b. Samuel of Ramerupt (RaM) and Judah ben Nathan (RIBaN), and by a certain R. Joseph. But their tosafot not being otherwise known, the actual father of the tosafot in France was Jacob b. Meir, known colloquially as Rabbeinu Tam, whose style was adopted by his successors. He wrote a great number of tosafot, many of which are to be found in his &quot;Sefer ha-Yashar&quot;; but not all, as many passages that are cited in the edited tosafot are not found in the work just mentioned. In Germany, at the same time, flourished Isaac ben Asher ha-Levi (RIBA), leader of the German tosafists, who wrote numerous tosafot, which are mentioned by Abraham ben David, and which are very often cited in the edited tosafot. But Isaac ben Asher&#x27;s tosafot were revised by his pupils, who, according to Rabbeinu Tam, sometimes ascribed to their teacher opinions which were not his. Zedekiah ben Abraham, however, refutes Rabbeinu Tam&#x27;s assertion.

The most prominent tosafist immediately after Rabbeinu Tam was his pupil and relative Isaac ben Samuel ha-Zaḳen (RI) of Dampierre, whose tosafot form a part of the Tosafot Yeshanim (see below). Isaac was succeeded by his pupil Samson ben Abraham of Sens (R&quot;SH) (d. about 1235), who, besides enriching the literature with his own compositions, revised those of his predecessors, especially his teacher&#x27;s, and compiled them into the group known as the Tosafot of Sens. Samson&#x27;s fellow pupil Judah b. Isaac of Paris (Sir Leon) was also very active; he wrote tosafot to several Talmudic treatises, of which those to Berakhot were published at Warsaw (1863); some of those to &#x27;Abodah Zarah are extant in manuscript. Among the many French tosafists deserving special mention was Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise (Sir Morel), who, owing to the destruction of the Talmud in France in his time, relied for the text entirely upon his memory.

The edited tosafot owe their existence particularly to Samson of Sens and to the following French tosafists of the thirteenth century: (1) Moses of Évreux, (2) Eliezer of Touques, and (3) Perez ben Elijah of Corbeil.

It has been said that the first German tosafist, Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi, was the head of a school, and that his pupils, besides composing tosafot of their own, revised his. In the thirteenth century the German schools were represented by Baruch ben Isaac, in Regensburg, and later by Meir of Rothenburg (MaHaRaM); the Italian school was represented by Isaiah di Trani. If the tosafot of Asher b. Jehiel (RoSH) (d. 1328) are to be included, the tosafistic period extended through more than two centuries. When the fanaticism of the French monasteries and the judgement of King Louis IX brought about the destruction of the Talmud, the writing of tosafot in France soon ceased.

===Overview===
Each generation of Tosafists would add to the compiled glosses, and therefore there are many different versions of the &quot;Tosafot&quot;. In addition, each compilation of the &quot;Tosafos&quot; did not contain everything that was said by the &quot;Tosafists&quot; on the subject so compilations will differ in what they say. Therefore, some things that were said by the &quot;Tosafists&quot; will be found only in obscure versions of the &quot;Tosafot&quot;.

===Publication===
The final version of these commentaries was published on the outer side of the pages of the Soncino edition of the Talmud, printed in Soncino, Italy (16th century), and was the first printed edition of the full Talmud. The publisher of that edition was a nephew of Rabbi Moshe of Spires (Shapiro) who was of the last generation of &quot;Tosafists&quot; and who initiated a project of writing a final compilation of the &quot;Tosafos&quot;. Before he published his Talmud he traveled throughout France to the schools where the &quot;Tosafists&quot; learned and gathered all of the different manuscripts of that final version of the &quot;Tosafos&quot; and printed them in his Talmud. Since then every publication of the Talmud was printed with the &quot;Tosafos&quot; on the outer side of the page (the inner side has the commentary of Rashi) and is an integral part of the study of the Talmud.

===The burning of the Talmud===
During the period of the &quot;Tosafists&quot; the church enacted a law that prohibited possession of the Talmud under pain of death and 24 wagon loads of scrolls of the Talmud were gathered from all of France and burned in the center of Paris. The intention of the church was that the study of the Talmud should be forgotten and once forgotten it would remain forgotten for all generations since there would be nobody to teach it. As a result, the &quot;Tosafists&quot; devised a system where they could study the Talmud without the existence of a text despite the vastness of the Talmud. They appointed scholars, each to be expert in one of the volumes of the Talmud, to know it by heart and very well, and so through these scholars they would have expertise and knowledge in all of the Talmud. As they would study a particular text in one volume of the Talmud those scholars who were expert in different volumes of the Talmud would tell of anything in the volume of the Talmud that they were expert on that would contradict their understanding of the text at hand. Thus an important aspect of the scholarship of the &quot;Tosafists&quot; is to use texts in different areas of the Talmud to disprove certain interpretations of the Talmud (often those of Rashi) and to determine the correct way to understand the Talmud.

==Authorities cited==

The Tosafot quote principally Rashi (very often under the designation &quot;qonṭres&quot; &quot;pamphlet&quot; (Rashi initially published his commentary in pamphlets), many of the ancient authorities (as Kalonymus of Lucca, Nathan ben Jehiel, and Chananel ben Chushiel ), some contemporary scholars (as Abraham ben David, Maimonides, Abraham ibn Ezra, and others), and about 130 German and French Talmudists of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Many of the last-named are known as authors of general Talmudic works, as, for instance, Eliezer ben Nathan of Mainz, Judah of Corbeil, and Jacob of Coucy; but many of them are known only through their being quoted in the Tosafot, as in the case of an Eliezer of Sens, a Jacob of Orléans, and many Abrahams and Isaacs. Some are mentioned just once, including Eliezer of &quot;Pelire&quot; [Falaise? Montpellier?], Ephraim b. David, and one Hezekiah. A commentary on the Pentateuch entitled &quot;Da&#x27;at Zeḳenim&quot; (Leghorn, 1783) is attributed to the Tosafists. In form this commentary follows the style of the Tosafot; Rashi is often discussed, and sometimes corrected.

==Schools of Tosafists==
===Tosafot of Sens===

The earliest collection, compiled by Samson ben Abraham of Sens. It was one of the main sources for the Tosafot of Touques, which in turn underlies the present printed Tosafot (&quot;Tosafot shelanu&quot;). Passages from the Tosafot of Sens which did not find their way into the main collection are sometimes printed under the title of Tosafot Yeshanim.

===Tosafot of Évreux===

Moses of Évreux, one of the most prolific tosafists, furnished glosses to the whole Talmud; they form a distinct group known as the Tosafot of Évreux. It may be presumed that the &quot;Tosafot of R. Moses&quot; mentioned by Mordechai ben Hillel are identical with the tosafot just mentioned. According to Joseph Colon and Elijah Mizraḥi, Moses wrote his glosses on the margin of Isaac Alfasi&#x27;s &quot;Halakhot,&quot; probably at the time of the burning of the Talmud.

===Tosafot of Touques===

Eliezer of Touques, of the second half of the thirteenth century, made a compendium of the Tosafot of Sens and of Évreux; this compendium is called the Tosafot of Touques, and forms the basis of the edited tosafot. Eliezer&#x27;s own glosses, written on the margin, are known as the Tosafot Gillayon or Gilyon Tosafot. It must be premised, however, that the Tosafot of Touques did not remain untouched; they were revised afterward and supplemented by the glosses of later tosafists. Gershon Soncino, who printed these tosafot, declares that his ancestor Moses of Fürth, who lived in the middle of the fifteenth century, was a descendant in the fifth generation of Moses of Speyer, who is mentioned in the Tosafot of Touques. It is supposed that the last redactor of these tosafot was a pupil of Samson of Chinon.

===Tosafot of Perez ben Elijah&#x27;s Pupils===

Perez ben Elijah of Corbeil was one of the most active of the later tosafists. Besides supplying tosafot to several treatises, which are quoted by many old authorities and are included among the edited tosafot (and many of which were seen in manuscript by Azulai), he revised those of his predecessors. His pupils were not less active; their additions are known as the Tosafot of Perez b. Elijah&#x27;s Pupils.

===Other bodies of tosafot===

====French Tosafot====
Mentioned in the novellae on Tamid ascribed to Abraham b. David. Zunz thinks that the Tosafot of Sens may be referred to under this title; but the fact that Abraham b. David was much earlier than Samson of Sens leads to the supposition that the glosses indicated are those of previous tosafists, as Rabbeinu Tam, Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi, and Isaac b. Samuel ha-Zaḳen and his son.

====Pisḳe Tosafot (&quot;Decisions of the Tosafot&quot;)====
Collection of halakic decisions gathered from the edited tosafot to thirty-six treatises—&quot;Nazir&quot; and &quot;Me&#x27;ilah&quot; being excepted—and generally printed in the margin of the Tosafot; in the later editions of the Talmud, after the text. These decisions number 5,931; of these 2,009 belong to the tractate&quot;Berakot&quot; and the order &quot;Mo&#x27;ed&quot;; 1,398 to &quot;Niddah&quot; and the order &quot;Nashim&quot;; 1,503 to &quot;Neziḳin&quot;; and 1,021 to &quot;Ḳodashim&quot;. The decisions contained in the tosafot to &quot;Shabbat&quot;, &quot;Pesaḥim&quot;, &quot;Giṭṭin&quot;, &quot;Ketubot&quot;, &quot;Baba Ḳamma&quot;, &quot;Baba Meẓi&#x27;a&quot;, &quot;Baba Batra&quot;, and &quot;Ḥullin&quot; number fully one-half of those recognized as authoritative. The compiler of these decisions can not be identified with certainty; Asher b. Jehiel, his son Jacob b. Asher, and Ezekiel, uncle of Eliezer of Touques, are given by different authorities. Jacob Nordhausen, also, is known to have compiled tosafot decisions; in fact, references to two groups of &quot;Pisḳe Tosafot&quot; are found in the works of the later commentators.

====Spanish Tosafot====
This term is used by Joseph Colon and by Jacob Baruch Landau and may apply to Talmudic novellae by Spanish authors. Jeshuah b. Joseph ha-Levi, for instance, applies the term &quot;tosafot&quot; to the novellae of Isaac ben Sheshet.

====The Edited Tosafot (called also Our Tosafot)====
The tosafot which have been published with the text of the Talmud ever since its earliest edition (see Talmud, Editions of). They extend to thirty-eight treatises of the Babylonian Talmud. Most of the treatises are covered by the Tosafot of Touques, some by the Tosafot of Sens; many are provided with the tosafot of various authors, revised by Perez b. Elijah&#x27;s school. The authorship of the tosafot to seventeen treatises only can be established with certainty:
* &quot;Berakot&quot;: Moses of Évreux;
* &quot;Shabbat&quot;, &quot; &#x27;Erubin&quot;, and &quot;Menaḥot&quot;: the Tosafot of Sens;
* &quot;Beẓah&quot;, &quot;Nedarim&quot;, &quot;Nazir&quot;, &quot;Sanhedrin&quot;, &quot;Makkot&quot;, and &quot;Me&#x27;ilah&quot;: Perez b. Elijah&#x27;s school (many written by Perez himself);
* &quot;Yoma&quot;: Meïr of Rothenburg;
* &quot;Giṭṭin&quot;, &quot;Baba Ḳamma&quot;, and &quot;Ḥullin&quot;: the Tosafot of Touques;
* &quot;Soṭah&quot;: Samuel of Évreux;
* &quot; &#x27;Avodah Zarah&quot;: Samuel of Falaise;
* &quot;Zebaḥim&quot;: Baruch b. Isaac of Worms.

The tosafot to &quot;Mo&#x27;ed Ḳaṭon&quot; were written by a pupil of a certain R. Isaac; the author of the tosafot to &quot;Ḥagigah&quot; wrote tosafot to other treatises also. Those to &quot;Ta&#x27;anit&quot; belong to the post-tosafot period, and differ in style from those to other treatises.

====Tosafot Alfasi====
Quoted by Joseph Colon (Responsa, Nos. 5, 31) and Judah Minz (Responsa, No. 10). The term may designate either the tosafot of Samuel b. Meïr and Moses of Évreux, or glosses to Alfasi&#x27;s &quot;Halakot&quot;.

====Tosafot of Gornish====
Mentioned by Joseph Solomon Delmedigo and Solomon Algazi, the latter quoting these tosafot to Bava kamma. But as the same quotation is made by Betzalel Ashkenazi and ascribed to a pupil of Perez ben Elijah, Azulai concludes that these tosafot originated in Perez b. Elijah&#x27;s school. Still, Mordecai ben Hillel mentions a R. Judah of Gornish, and Abraham ibn Akra reproduces Talmudic novellae by &quot;M. of Gornish&quot; (Embden gives &quot;Meïr of Gornish&quot; in the Latin translation of the catalogue of the Oppenheim Library, No. 667). Manuscript No. 7 of the Günzburg collection bears the superscription &quot;Tosafot of Gornish to Yebamot,&quot; and in these tosafot French and German rabbis are quoted. Manuscript No. 603 of the same collection contains also the Tosafot of Gornish and novellae by Judah Minz, and fragments of Gornish tosafot are found in manuscripts in other libraries.

Different theories have been advanced with regard to the name &quot;Gornish.&quot; According to S. Schechter, it is a corruption of &quot;Mayence&quot;, while H. Adler thinks it a corruption of &quot;Norwich&quot;. Gross (l.c.) thinks that Gornish may be identical with Gournay, in France, and that &quot;M. of Gornish,&quot; apparently the author of the Tosafot of Gornish, may be Moses of Gornish and identical with the Moses of גריינץ mentioned in the Tosafot of Sens (to Pesaḥim). It may be added that in the supplement to Zacuto&#x27;s &quot;Yuḥasin&quot; a David of &quot;Durnish&quot; occurs.

====Tosafot Ḥiẓoniyyot (&quot;Exterior&quot; or &quot;Uncanonical Tosafot&quot;)====
Tosafot which are neither of Sens nor of Touques. They are so called by Betzalel Ashkenazi; he included many fragments of them in his &quot;Shitah Mekubetzet&quot;, to &quot;Bava Metzia&quot;, &quot;Nazir&quot;, etc.

====Tosafot Shiṭṭah (or Shiṭṭah)====
Name sometimes applied to the recensions of Perez b. Elijah or to the tosafot of Jehiel of Paris.

====Tosafot Yeshanim (&quot;Tosafot of the Ancients&quot;)====
This group comprises four smaller ones: (1) the general tosafot of Sens, including those appearing among the edited tosafot; (2) the earlier unedited tosafot (for example, those to Ḳiddushin by Isaac b. Samuel haZaken of Dampierre, and those to Avodah Zarah by his son Elhanan ben Isaac); these sometimes appear separately under the title of Tosafot ha-Ri; (3) a collection of old tosafot published by Joseph Jessel b. Wolf ha-Levi in &quot;Sugyot ha-Shas&quot; (Berlin, 1736); (4) various tosafot found in ancient manuscripts, as the tosafot to Chullin written in 1360, the manuscript of which is in the Munich Library (No. 236). In the collection published by Joseph Jessel b. Wolf haLevi (No. 3), besides the old tosafot to Yoma by Moses of Coucy, there are single tosafot to sixteen treatises—Shabbat, Rosh HaShanah, Megillah, Gittin, Bava Metzia, Menaḥot, Bechorot, Eruvin, Beitzah, Ketubot, Kiddushin, Nazir, Bava Batra, Horayot, Keritot, and Niddah. In the Vilna edition of the Talmud edited by Romm, the &quot;old tosafot&quot; to several treatises are printed.

====Tosafot ha-Rid====

By Rabbi Isaiah di Trani.

====Tosafot Hachmei Anglia====

A small collection of tosafot composed by rabbis from England.

====Tosafot ha-Rosh====

A commentary in tosafot style, and largely dependent on the earlier tosafot collections, composed by Asher ben Jehiel.

==Bibliography==

===Tosafot collections===
The Tosafot shelanu are printed in most Talmud editions, in the column farther from the binding. The Vilna edition also includes tosafot from other collections, such as Tosafot Yeshanim, Tosafot ha-Ri and Tosafot ha-Rid on a few tractates. The Piske Tosafot (decisions of the Tosafot) are printed at the end of each tractate.

Complete sets of the Tosafot ha-Rosh and the Tosafot of Rabbi Peretz are published separately, as are individual volumes from the Tosafot Yeshanim and a few others. The most recent editions of the Talmud, such as the Friedmann edition published by Oz vHadar, incorporate these collections at the back of each volume, in a synoptic fashion. Most of the other collections remain in manuscript or in the form of quotations in later works.

<text>Kirunapartiet () was a local political party in Kiruna Municipality, Sweden. It was founded in 1994 as a splinter group of the local branch of the Social Democrats and was led by Lars Törnman from 1994 until 2010, when Törnman left the party for the Social Democrats. After Törnman&#x27;s leaving the party, Henry Emmoth was selected as its new leader.

In the municipal elections in 1994, Kirunapartiet got 33% of the total vote, which meant that the party was the largest of the parties in the municipal government, and got the right to appoint the municipal commissioner. It held this right until 2006, when the Social Democrats received more votes in the municipal elections of that year. Following Törnman&#x27;s realignment and a (failed) internal attempt to dissolve the party in favor of a stronger Social Democratic party, the municipal election of 2010 resulted in poor figures for the party.

The Kiruna Party attempted to reach parliament in 2002 (as a part of the Norrbotten Party ticket) and Norrbotten County council in 2002 and 2006, respectively. In 2006, the party failed by a mere 137 votes to gain representation.

<text>Desborough is a town in North Northamptonshire, England, lying in the Ise Valley between Market Harborough and Kettering. It was an industrial centre for weaving and shoe-making in the 19th century and had a long association with the Co-operative movement.

==History==

Desborough&#x27;s origins lie in the Bronze Age of about 2000 BC. Urns from that period have been found in and around the town.

Many archaeological finds from the Iron Age and the Anglo-Saxon period have also been made. Some, such as the 1st-century Desborough Mirror and the Anglo-Saxon Desborough Necklace, are now in the possession of the British Museum.

Domesday Book (1086) refers to Desborough as a &quot;place of judgement&quot;. The name itself is thought to have derived from &#x27;Disburg&#x27;, which meant a sacred and fortified place. In the High Street centrepiece of what is now the Market Square stands a pillar that is called locally the Town Cross, though it is a square column topped by a stone ball. It is thought to have served as a gateway pillar from Harrington Hall.

From the 17th century, Desborough developed around the spinning and weaving industries. The town&#x27;s factories used local wool and flax to produce fine cloth and linen until the mid-19th century. Silk weaving then developed in a Paddock Lane factory and shoe-making also gained importance.

==Transport==
Desborough lies five miles (8 km) south-east of Market Harborough, north-west of Kettering, and south-west of Corby. The A6 Rothwell–Desborough bypass opened on 14 August 2003.

Between 1857 and 1968, Desborough had a railway station, opened and operated by the Midland Railway (later the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and, after nationalisation, British Rail). This was part of an extension of its network from Leicester to Bedford and Hitchin, but it was closed under the Beeching cuts.

==Churches==
Desborough has an Anglican parish church, St Giles&#x27;s, along with a Baptist church, a United Reformed Church, and the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity.

St Giles&#x27;s Church (Anglican) is the oldest surviving building in the town, dating from about 1225. It is believed to stand on the site of an earlier Saxon church. Its relics from the town&#x27;s history include part of an Anglo-Saxon cross carved from stone, a Tudor rood screen, and reminders of the English Civil War. Close by the church is the 18th-century Church House, with stuccoed Doric pillars. This became Desborough House in the 19th century and is now the Services Club.

===Partnership===
On 7 September 1969, an Anglican/ Methodist partnership was inaugurated in the presence of the Bishop of Peterborough and the Chairman of the Oxford District. Since then a Methodist minister has been working in partnership with the Anglican vicar. St Giles is part of the Anglican united benefice of Desborough and Brampton Ash with Braybrooke and Dingley. It has regular church festivals, including one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest and longest-running Christmas tree festivals (over 100 trees, held since 1998). The trees are contributed by local organisations, companies, families and individuals.

The Kettering Leg of the annual Student Cross pilgrimage to Walsingham starts near Desborough.

==The Old Manor House==

The Old Manor House in Gold Street retains features of its late 17th-century origins. Ferdinand Poulton, a Roman Catholic lawyer, was Lord of the Manor and reputedly one of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot conspirators.

==Government and community==
Governance of Desborough lies (in descending order) with the North Northamptonshire Unitary Council (From April 2021) and the local Desborough Town Council.

Desborough belongs to the Charter of European Rural Communities, which links it to 27 other EU member towns and villages. It is twinned with Neuville de Poitou in the Vienne department of France and with Bièvre in the Walloon region of Belgium.

The Desborough Community Development Trust campaigns for improvements to the town.

==Co-operative movement==
With the intention of preventing exploitation of workers by agents and employers, local men founded the Desborough Co-operative Society in 1863. Starting with local shops and then a corset and lingerie factory, the Desborough Co-op once had a department store, a bank, a supermarket, a travel agents, a ladies&#x27; shoe and clothing shop and a number of corner stores.

After several mergers, the town is now served by the Central England Co-op. Over the years, a number of its functions have ceased, including the bank branch and the ladies&#x27; shoe and clothing shop. However, a Co-operative undertakers has opened in one of the former corner shops.

The former Co-op Corset Factory, now owned by Wacoal Eveden Ltd makes lingerie and swimwear. The site includes the original Victorian factory, and immediately opposite, Eveden&#x27;s warehousing and UK factory shop. The former Co-operative Society Sports Ground with a football field and tennis courts is now covered by a housing development, Desbeau Park – Desbeau being the name of a range of lingerie made at the Corset Factory.

==Sport and leisure==

At 09:00 every Saturday morning, there is a parkrun event. This is a free 5km run/walk, which starts at the leisure centre, with the course then going through The Plens nature reserve and the Green Space. The event started on Saturday 20th July 2024. 

Every Sunday morning, local volunteers organise Desborough Greenspace junior parkrun held a Desborough leisure centre, a free 2km event aimed at increasing physical activity in children aged 4-14 years and providing volunteering opportunities within the community for all ages. In 2019 it won the then Kettering Borough Council community project of the year, followed by the Northamptonshire Sport award for the countywide community project of the year. 

In 2022, North Northamptonshire Council (NNC) won an International Green Apple Environment Award in a national campaign to find the greenest companies and organisations. This was based on Desborough Greenspace, which was established in 2012 as a large 22-hectare site that would be far less formally managed with a vision to create a very large and accessible natural space for local people as well as biodiversity.

Desborough has a Non-League football team, Desborough Town F.C., which plays at Waterworks Field.

The town&#x27;s leisure complex was built in the later months of 2012. It holds a gym, a café, a football court, a basketball court and an outside skate park.

Targetcraft Archers club meets at nearby West Lodge Rural Centre. Desborough Green Space Junior parkrun takes place there every Sunday morning at the Leisure Centre.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Northampton, Heart East, Smooth East Midlands (formerly Connect FM) and Shire Sounds, community based radio station. 

The town is served by these local newspapers, Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph, Harborough Mail and Northampton Chronicle and Echo. 

==Education==
The town has a primary school-cum-infant/junior school, consisting of Loatlands Primary and combined Havelock Infant and Junior schools. Secondary education takes place outside the town.

<text>In mathematics and solid state physics, the first Brillouin zone (named after Léon Brillouin) is a uniquely defined primitive cell in reciprocal space. In the same way the Bravais lattice is divided up into Wigner–Seitz cells in the real lattice, the reciprocal lattice is broken up into Brillouin zones. The boundaries of this cell are given by planes related to points on the reciprocal lattice. The importance of the Brillouin zone stems from the description of waves in a periodic medium given by Bloch&#x27;s theorem, in which it is found that the solutions can be completely characterized by their behavior in a single Brillouin zone.

The first Brillouin zone is the locus of points in reciprocal space that are closer to the origin of the reciprocal lattice than they are to any other reciprocal lattice points (see the derivation of the Wigner–Seitz cell). Another definition is as the set of points in &quot;k&quot;-space that can be reached from the origin without crossing any Bragg plane. Equivalently, this is the Voronoi cell around the origin of the reciprocal lattice.

There are also second, third, &quot;etc.&quot;, Brillouin zones, corresponding to a sequence of disjoint regions (all with the same volume) at increasing distances from the origin, but these are used less frequently. As a result, the &quot;first&quot; Brillouin zone is often called simply the &quot;Brillouin zone&quot;. In general, the &quot;n&quot;-th Brillouin zone consists of the set of points that can be reached from the origin by crossing exactly &quot;n&quot; − 1 distinct Bragg planes. A related concept is that of the irreducible Brillouin zone, which is the first Brillouin zone reduced by all of the symmetries in the point group of the lattice (point group of the crystal).

The concept of a Brillouin zone was developed by Léon Brillouin (1889–1969), a French physicist.

Within the Brillouin zone, a &quot;constant-energy surface&quot; represents the loci of all the formula_1-points (that is, all the electron momentum values) that have the same energy. Fermi surface is a special constant-energy surface that separates the unfilled orbitals from the filled ones at zero kelvin.

==Critical points==
 
Several points of high symmetry are of special interest – these are called critical points.

Other lattices have different types of high-symmetry points. They can be found in the illustrations below.

<text>The European Science Foundation (ESF) is an association of 11 member organizations devoted to scientific research in 8 European countries. ESF is an independent, non-governmental, non-profit organization that promotes science in Europe. It was established in 1974 and its offices are located in Strasbourg, France (headquarters).

ESF Member Organizations are research-performing and research-funding organizations, academies and learned societies across Europe.

After four decades of stimulating European research through its networking, ESF undertook a re-alignment and re-calibration of its strategic vision and focus. The launch of its Expert division &quot;Science Connect&quot; beginning of 2017 marks the next phase of its evolution and has been born out of an understanding of the science landscape, funding context and the needs of the research community.

==Past activities==

Up to 2015 ESF provided a platform for research scoping, planning and networking on a European and global scale for ESF member organizations. ESF activities were organized around three operational bases: strategy, synergy and management. In line with its then mission and strategic plan, the European Science Foundation ran programmes in science; programmes to enhance science synergy such as research networking programmes and collaborative research projects for European scientists; along with activities dedicated to science management, such as providing administrative services to independent scientific committees and other organizations.

===ESF-EUROHORCs – Funding gap===

In June 2008, ESF in collaboration with EUROHORCs (European Heads of Research Councils) published a policy briefing &#x27;The EUROHORCs and ESF Vision on a Globally Competitive ERA and their Road Map for Actions to Help Build it&#x27;, detailing essential requirements to build a globally competitive European Research Area within the next five to ten years. At the time, EUROHORCs used the European Science Foundation as an implementation agency. In 2014, this instrument disappeared from the European landscape and has not been replaced by any other funding mechanism.

==Change of focus==
ESF has recently changed its scope of work. ESF has closed its traditional research support activities (European Collaborative Research Projects, Exploratory Workshops, Research Networking Programmes, etc.) and is focused now on supporting the scientific community through scientific-support services delivered by its Expert division (Science Connect). 

==Structure==

ESF is structured as follows:

* Governing bodies
* Science Connect Division
* Community of Experts
* Expert boards

===Governing bodies===

The annual &quot;assembly&quot; is the highest level decision making body of the ESF. It elects the ESF president, the Executive Board, ratifies the budget and accounts and admits new members. The assembly delegates are appointed by ESF member organizations.

The &quot;Executive Board&quot; sets and direct the overall strategy of the ESF and coordinates the relations with EU and other institutions. The Executive Board consists of the ESF president and 3 to 8 member organizations. The Executive Board meets twice a year.

The &quot;President&quot; officially represents the ESF to the public and in relations with other national or international organizations.

The &quot;Chief Executive&quot; is responsible for the implementation of the strategy and policy set by the Executive Board, for administration of the ESF office and its finance and for ensuring the execution of the decision of the assembly and the Governing Council.

===Science Connect Division===

Science Connect is ESF&#x27;s Expert services division dedicated to support scientific decision-making through a range of science-support services, such as Grant Evaluation, Career Tracking, coordination of EU-funded Projects and the hosting of scientific platforms and Expert Boards.

===Community of Experts===

According to the ESF website, the Community of Experts is a network of international recognized experts that covers the full spectrum of the scientific landscape (Humanities, Economics and Social Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Engineering Sciences, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Life and Biomedical Sciences). Its role is to sustain scientific collaboration and support excellence in research grant peer-review and proposal evaluation across all scientific disciplines.

ESF&#x27;s Community of Experts comprises two colleges: 
* The College of Review Panel Members. Review Panel Members have a broad expertise in several scientific disciplines and their mission is to build consensus during the evaluation of research proposals. 
* The College of Expert Reviewers. Expert Reviewers are scientists specialized in a specific scientific domain and are in charge of assessing and evaluating several types of proposals such as fellowship applications and research projects.

===Expert boards===

Since 1974 ESF has set up and hosted expert boards and committees in several scientific domains. These include space sciences; radio-astronomy frequencies; nuclear physics; marine and polar sciences; and materials science. At present ESF hosts the following Expert Boards:

====European Space Sciences Committee (ESSC)====

Established in 1974, the ESSC provides unbiased, expert advice to the space scientific community including the European Space Agency, the European Commission, EU national space agencies. Over the years, the ESSC has become the reference body in Europe for independent scientific advice on space matters and a key partner for international research collaboration.

====Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee (NuPECC)====

NuPECC&#x27;s aim is to strengthen European collaboration in nuclear physics through the definition of a network of complementary facilities within Europe. NuPECC issues recommendations on the development, organization and support of European nuclear physics and particular projects.

====Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF)====

Established in 1988, CRAF represents all the major radio astronomical observatories in Europe. CRAF initiates and encourages scientific studies aimed at reducing radio astronomy interference at source and the effects of interference. Throughout the years CRAF has become an active voice in Europe and engages with other groups of radio astronomers in discussions with international organizations that decide on the use of radio spectrum.

<doc id="562073" wikidata="Q2916611" url="?curid=562073" title="Dor Yeshorim">
<text>Dor Yeshorim () also called Committee for Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases, is a nonprofit organization that offers genetic screening to members of the Jewish community worldwide. Its objective is to minimize, and eventually eliminate, the incidence of genetic disorders common to Jewish people, such as Tay–Sachs disease. Dor Yeshorim is based in Brooklyn, New York, but has offices in Israel and various other countries.

== History ==
In both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish communities, there is an increased rate of a number of genetic disorders such as Tay–Sachs disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that goes unnoticed in carriers, but is fatal within the first few years of life in almost all homozygotes. (The exception is the rare adult-onset Tay–Sachs, which is normally not fatal but is incapacitating.)

Orthodox Judaism generally opposes selective abortion. Although preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is often approved by Halakha, it is a difficult and costly process. By avoiding marriages between &quot;carriers&quot;, the incidence of the disorders decreases without having to resort to such methods.

Dor Yeshorim was founded in 1983 by Rabbi Josef Ekstein in Brooklyn. Its name, meaning &quot;upright generation&quot;, comes from Psalms 112:2.

In a 2006 interview, Ekstein said that while four of his first five children died of Tay-Sachs disease, none of his children born subsequent to the founding of Dor Yeshorim suffered the condition. The same interview quotes a New York neurologist who credits the near-total disappearance of the condition from the ultra-orthodox community due to Dor Yeshorim&#x27;s involvement.

In 2005, a subsidiary of Dor Yeshorim called Kehila Cord was created for the collection and storing of umbilical cord blood.

In 2016, Dor Yeshorim received media attention when a rap video of two schoolgirls beat-boxing about their marriage prospects was shared in the Orthodox Jewish community. The organisation claimed to be &quot;very disturbed by the whole thing&quot; and that &quot;...it is below our dignity as an organization to promote such a thing&quot;. Subsequently, Dor Yeshorim also issued an official statement distancing itself from the video.

== Operations ==
Dor Yeshorim screens only for recessive traits that give rise to lethal or severely debilitating disorders, providing prophylactic, rather than diagnostic services. They do not screen for disorders arising from dominant gene mutations, as these cannot be prevented by informed mate selection. Only conditions which can be reliably reported as a positive or negative genetic match are tested. 

Three panels of tests are offered: the original Standard Ashkenazi Panel, the Sephardi/Mizrahi Panel, and the Optional Ashkenazi Panel (offered for an additional fee). Since January 2016, people who indicate that they are of Sephardic descent are automatically tested with both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi panels. The Standard Ashkenazi Panel includes testing for the following diseases:

* Tay–Sachs disease
* Familial dysautonomia
* Cystic fibrosis
* Canavan disease
* Glycogen storage disease (type 1)
* Fanconi anemia (type C)
* Bloom syndrome
* Niemann–Pick disease
* Mucolipidosis type IV
*Spinal muscular atrophy

The samples collected by Dor Yeshorim are anonymized; the only personal information associated with each sample is date of birth. A randomized ID number that identifies the sample is provided to the submitter. When two Dor Yeshorim clients contemplate marriage, they exchange sample ID numbers and birth dates and each contacts the organization. When both carry a gene for the same disorder, they are informed that the match is not recommended. In that case, a client can optionally contact Dor Yeshorim separately for counseling and support services. In this way, complete privacy is guaranteed; not even Dor Yeshorim employees are aware of who was found to be genetically incompatible unless the clients desire otherwise. Dor Yeshorim does not report to the clients which disease was indicated, in order to avoid &quot;unnecessary emotional burden&quot; and &quot;stigmatization of families&quot;. In the context of shidduchim, this genetic compatibility check is commonly run within the first three dates or even before the first date, to avoid disappointments and heartbreak.

In the United States, testing costs range from $225 to $500. One-half of the actual testing costs is subsidized by private donors and governments.

For convenience, Dor Yeshorim provides yearly testing sessions at Orthodox Jewish schools for students who are approaching marriageable age. Samples can also be provided privately.

== Reception ==
The system has received praise and criticism from both within as well as outside the community.

By March 2006, Dor Yeshorim had achieved wide support in the Orthodox Jewish community and among its leaders, and had become household name that was taken for granted. By that time, they had tested over 200,000 individuals, and had responded &quot;incompatible&quot; to 750 suggested matches.

There has been criticism leveled against the method used by Dor Yeshorim by Moshe Dovid Tendler, a professor of medical ethics at Yeshiva University.

The question arises, when do you stop? There are close to 90 [homozygous] genes you wouldn’t want to have. Will this lead to people showing each other computer print outs of their genetic conditions? We’ll never get married.

Fred Rosner, a professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said that &quot;I think Dor Yeshorim performs a tremendous service...screening is a wonderful thing to do, and if you can avoid the birth of a potentially lethally affected child, that is a good thing.&quot;

Dor Yeshorim has been criticised for withholding patient results, for declining to publish its financial records and for not testing anyone who has already been tested elsewhere, by Geoffrey Alderman, who says that Dor Yeshorim fails some fundamental tests itself. Critics including the Association for the Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases, have described Dor Yeshorim in the UK as a &quot;Wedding tax&quot;.

Dor Yeshorim was also criticised for allegedly seeking to convince the Jewish community it must, for “religious reasons”, use its service, by circulating a letter from Bezalel Rakow. Rakow was a signatory to a subsequent letter stating that &quot;Every individual has the privilege to perform the test in a manner consistent with his desires.” In 2012, the Jewish Chronicle published a letter by a Tay–Sachs carrier, who was hurt by a Dor Yeshorim organiser&#x27;s insinuation that there was stigma attached to being a Tay–Sachs carrier.

<doc id="562075" wikidata="Q1163309" url="?curid=562075" title="June List">
<text>The June List (, jl) was a Swedish left Eurosceptic political party. Founded in 2004, it received 14% in the European Parliament election of the same year - gaining three seats. In the elections of 2009, however, it saw a drop of 11 percentage points in support and lost all of its seats. Due to its subsequent decline the party has been inactive since the 2014 European Parliament election.

The party also ran in the Swedish 2006 parliamentary election, but it only received 0.47% of the votes, far below the 4% needed to get into parliament.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The party was formed in 2003 in the wake of the Swedish euro referendum held in September, in which the adoption of the euro was rejected. The party was founded by Nils Lundgren, former member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and chief economist of the bank Nordea, Lars Wohlin, former member of the Christian Democrats and Jesper Katz. 

Lundgren hoped to receive support from eurosceptical voters dissatisfied with their usual parties&#x27; positive attitudes towards the euro and further European integration. Among the Swedish parties represented in parliament at the time, only the Left Party, Center Party and the Green Party were eurosceptic, while the Social Democratic Party, the major left-wing party, and all right-wing parties with exception of the Center party were positive towards European integration. Aiming at receiving support from this broad political spectrum, the board of the party contained people that had been previously active in both left- and right-wing parties.

The party takes its name from the June Movement in Denmark, which is a eurosceptic party named after the timing of the Danish referendum that rejected the Treaty of Maastricht. The June Movement was also a major source of inspiration for the June List.

=== In the European Parliament (2004–2009) ===

The party succeeded in capturing 14% of the votes in the 2004 European Parliament election, thereby gaining three of the 19 Swedish seats. The three MEPs were Nils Lundgren, former social democrat Hélène Goudin and former Christian democrat Lars Wohlin. The June List was one of the founding members of the Independence and Democracy group in the European Parliament.

In 2006 Wohlin, left the June List for the Christian Democrats, leaving the party with only two seats. Wohlin stated that he wanted to be able to &quot;work for the Christian Democrats and the Alliance for Sweden in the 2006 parliamentary election&quot; as reason for leaving the June List.

The June List was on the ballot for the 2006 parliamentary elections in Sweden. The party&#x27;s platform during the election focused on a few main issues: to increase the number of people working in the private sector, hence increasing the state&#x27;s tax income, a referendum on the European Union constitution and nuclear power, and increased municipal autonomy and more local referendums. All issues that were not in the party&#x27;s relatively short party program were left to the approximately 100 candidates to decide on. The voters were encouraged to choose to vote for a particular June List candidate that they preferred rather than to cast a general ballot for the party itself.

At one point, it seemed possible that the party might be able to break the 4% threshold necessary to enter parliament, with the party reaching 4.5% in the polls in September 2005, but after that peak the party&#x27;s support plummeted well below the 4% barrier and in the months before the election it became clear that the party would not be taking seats in parliament that year. In the end, the party received only 26,072 votes (0.47%).

Nils Lundgren resigned as party leader in March 2008. The party decided to elect two co-leaders instead of one party leader. They elected Sören Wibe, former MEP and MP for the Swedish Social Democratic Party, and Annika Eriksson, long-time member of the party&#x27;s governing board. Eriksson resigned after five months in January 2009 because of disagreements with Wibe and the party governing board. 

Swedish businessman Sven Hagströmer, one of the two men who gave his name to the Hagströmer &amp; Qviberg group of companies, served on the board of the party.

=== Decline (2009-2014) ===
The June List suffered a significant decline in its support at the 2009 European Parliament election and lost all of its seats in the European parliament. The party had hoped that Wibe would attract Eurosceptic voters. After the election, the party elected Wibe and as co-leaders. Wibe died on 29 December 2010 after a short illness, leaving Swedenborg as sole party leader until she resigned in 2013.

The party was briefly revived for the 2014 European Parliament election. The party selected , former chief economist of Nordea and member of the Social Democratic Party, as the new party leader and front-runner. The second front-runner was Camilla Lindberg, former MP for the Liberal People&#x27;s Party. The party received only 11,629 votes nationwide.

<text>USS &quot;Denver&quot; (CL-58) was a light cruiser. &quot;Denver&quot; launched on 4 April 1942 by New York Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, New Jersey; sponsored by Miss L. J. Stapleton, daughter of the Mayor of Denver; and commissioned on 15 October 1942, Captain Robert Carney in command. It was the second ship named for the city of Denver, Colorado.

==Service history==

===1943===

&quot;Denver&quot; sailed from Philadelphia on 23 January 1943, and arrived at Efate, New Hebrides on 14 February. Thomas Darden was in command. The new cruiser first saw combat in the bombardment of Vila on Kolombangara in the Solomon Islands, on 6 March. During this action her force engaged and sank the Japanese destroyers and in the Battle of Blackett Strait. Continuing her operations in the Solomons, &quot;Denver&quot; joined the bombardment of Ballale Island on 29–30 June in conjunction with the invasion landings on New Georgia, then remained in the area on patrol.

On the last day of October 1943, &quot;Denver&quot; sortied from Port Purvis with Task Force 39 (TF 39) to intercept an enemy force attempting to disrupt the landings at Cape Torokina, Bougainville. In the resulting battle of Empress Augusta Bay on the night of 1/2 November, the American ships sank one enemy light cruiser and a destroyer and damaged two heavy cruisers and two destroyers, while the four other enemy ships broke off the action and retired. During the heavy firing &quot;Denver&quot; was hit by three shells which fortunately did not explode. She shared in the Navy Unit Commendation awarded her division for its outstanding performance in this battle.

&quot;Denver&quot; covered the support landings on Cape Torokina on 10–11 November 1943, and two days later she was attacked by the lone No.321 &quot;Rikko&quot; of the 702st &quot;Kōkūtai&quot;, piloted by Hidezumi Maruyama, attacked &quot;Denver&#x27;s&quot; taskforce at night and torpedoed &quot;Denver&quot;, badly damaging her. Maruyama&#x27;s plane was perforated 380 times by anti-aircraft fire but managed to return to base. She was towed by to Port Purvis and then by to Espiritu Santo for temporary repairs, then sailed to Mare Island for permanent repairs, arriving on 2 January 1944.

===1944===
&quot;Denver&quot; returned to the forward area at Eniwetok, arriving on 22 June. Eight days later, she put to sea to screen carriers as they launched strikes to neutralize Japanese bases in the Bonins and Marianas during the invasion of the Marianas. She bombarded Iwo Jima on 4 July, and after screening continued air assaults returned to Eniwetok on 5 August.

&quot;Denver&quot; sailed from Port Purvis on 6 September for the invasion of the Palaus. She bombarded Angaur Island from 12 to 18 September, then covered a task unit engaged in minesweeping, reconnaissance and underwater demolition operations before the landings on Ulithi on 23 September. She returned to Manus Island on 28 September to prepare for the return to the Philippines.

&quot;Denver&quot; departed on 12 October for the landings on Leyte, bombarding Suluan Island and Dulag to open the vast invasion fleet&#x27;s way into Leyte Gulf, then sailed on to bombard the southern landing beaches. As the Japanese sent the major portion of their remaining combatant fleet south in a desperate attempt to break up the landings, &quot;Denver&quot;″s group took station in Surigao Strait on 24 October to prevent the passage of the Japanese Southern Force into Leyte Gulf. Attacks were made by motor torpedo boats and destroyers stationed in advance of the battle line. , , and were all that remained of the Japanese ships when &quot;Denver&quot; and the others of the battle line opened fire at 0351. With three other cruisers, she made a material contribution to the cumulative gunfire which sank &quot;Yamashiro&quot;. &quot;Mogami&quot; was later sunk by aircraft, and &quot;Shigure&quot; was the sole survivor of Nishimura&#x27;s fleet which had sailed forth for this phase of the decisive Battle for Leyte Gulf. After this action, &quot;Denver&quot; sailed to aid in the destruction of any surviving enemy vessels, aiding in sinking early in the day on 25 October.

Continuing her service in Leyte Gulf, she fought off numerous attacks; during the one of 28 October, a bomb released from one of the planes she shot down exploded nearby causing minor damage and slight flooding. She screened reinforcement landings in November and fought off a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on 27 November, suffering four men wounded from fragments of a bomb which exploded off the starboard quarter. She joined the heavy covering group, for the Mindoro landings of 13–16 December, then returned to Manus on 24 December.

===1945===
Returning to San Pedro Bay on 3 January, &quot;Denver&quot; sortied the next day to cover the landings at Lingayen Gulf. She remained in the Philippines to join in the consolidation of those islands. She covered the landings on Zambales on 29–30 January, supported minesweeping near and landings on Grande Island; provided fire support at Nasugbu on 31 January; escorted a replenishment convoy to Mindoro from 1 to 7 February; covered the Army landings around Mariveles Bay from 13 to 16 February, rescuing the survivors of the destroyer ; and supported the operations on Palawan and Mindanao Islands from February to May.

On 7 June, &quot;Denver&quot; sailed from Subic Bay for the amphibious assaults on Brunei Bay, Borneo, and later at Balikpapan. She covered the pre-invasion work of minesweeping units and underwater demolition teams, and provided fire support for the invading troops until returning to San Pedro Bay, Leyte on 4 July for brief overhaul.

&quot;Denver&quot; got underway for Okinawa on 13 July to hunt Japanese shipping off the China coast as part of Task Force 95 until 7 August. She sailed from Okinawa on 9 September to cover the evacuation of men of the Allied forces rescued from prison camps in the Wakayama area and covered the landing of occupation troops at Wakanoura Wan from 25 September to 20 October, when she sailed for home.

&quot;Denver&quot; arrived at Norfolk on 21 November, and after overhaul, reported to Newport, Rhode Island, in January 1946 for duty training men of the Naval Reserve, and a good-will visit to Quebec, Canada. In April, she arrived at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she was placed out of commission in reserve on 7 February 1947. Stricken on 1 March 1959, ex-&quot;Denver&quot; was sold on 4 February 1960 to Union Minerals and Alloy Corp., New York City, for $260,689.89, and broken-up at Kearny, New Jersey, during November 1960.

==Awards==
In addition to the Navy Unit Commendation, &quot;Denver&quot; received 11 battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="562077" wikidata="Q1411651" url="?curid=562077" title="Toothing">
<text>Toothing was originally a hoax claim that Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones or PDAs were being used to arrange random sexual encounters, perpetrated as a prank on the media who reported it. The hoax was created by Ste Curran, then Editor at Large at the gaming magazine &quot;Edge&quot;, and ex-journalist Simon Byron. They based it on the two concepts, namely dogging and bluejacking, that were popular at the time. The creators started a forum in March 2004 where they wrote fake news articles about toothing with other members and then sent them off to well-known Internet-based news services. The point of the hoax was to &quot;highlight how journalists are happy to believe something is true without necessarily checking the facts&quot;. Dozens of news organizations, including BBC News, Wired News, and &quot;The Independent&quot; thought the toothing story was real and printed it. On April 4, 2005, Curran and Byron admitted that the whole thing was a hoax. There have, however, been real Bluetooth dating devices since.

==Conception==
Devised by Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson, Bluetooth is an open wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances from mobile devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and personal computers. Originally, Bluetooth was only intended for wireless exchanging of files between these devices, but it was later discovered that it could also be used for sexual intentions. The hoax concept of toothing started around March 2004 in the form of a forum designed by Ste Curran, then Editor at Large at games magazine &quot;Edge&quot;, and ex-journalist Simon Byron. Toothing was conceived as a merger of the two concepts dogging with bluejacking, both of which were frequently mentioned in the UK media around that time. Byron said he and Curran were &quot;idly messaging about the Stan Collymore dogging scandal, and how this stupid sexual buzzword had (apparently) come from nowhere,&quot; when they came up with the concept. &quot;We wondered if we could create our own. We wonder a lot of things, and rarely push them past concept, because we’re as collectively creative as we are frustratingly idle. This particularly concept was simple enough to outstrip the temptations of grinning, saying &#x27;Yeah!&#x27;, and wandering off to see what was on [television].&quot; Several newspapers have also compared toothing to dogging.

In toothing, a Bluetooth device is used to find other Bluetooth enabled devices within a close distance (on trains or buses, for example), and then send the expression &quot;toothing?&quot; as an initial greeting, letting the person with the enabled Bluetooth device know you are looking for sex. If sending of text messages via Bluetooth is not possible, the Bluetooth name of the mobile phone can be set to &quot;toothing?&quot; or something else to indicate interest. The pair of hoaxers wrote fake news articles on the forum about toothing and sent them off well-known Internet-based news services. Byron said he had to write &quot;&quot;Penthouse&quot;-letters-page style sexual adventure stories&quot; for articles and interviews with the media. The point with hoax was, according to Byron, to &quot;highlight how journalists are happy to believe something is true without necessarily checking the facts.&quot;

==Spread in media==

The concept of toothing quickly reached a large audience, even in countries outside of the UK. Curran and Byron said they kept a record from the start of all their mentions in the media, &quot;but there were soon too many to record in full.&quot; They agreed to do an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;many papers read that and followed up, broadsheet and tabloid, regional, national, all over the planet.&quot; One of the hoaxers made an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live, and a member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom reportedly declared his interest in toothing as a way of meeting women. The couple also received offers to license official toothing merchandise such as sex lines, websites, and mobile-phone software. Dozens of news organizations, including BBC, Wired News, Infosyncworld, and &quot;The Independent&quot; fell for the story and printed it. &quot;The Guardian&quot; also printed the story, but the article&#x27;s author suspected it to be an April Fools&#x27; Day prank. The BBC wrote in their article:

One practitioner is Jon, a &quot;Toother&quot; living near London.

&quot;One morning I received an anonymous text message via bluetooth,&quot; he told BBC News.

&quot;I didn&#x27;t understand what had happened, but that evening I did some research and worked out how to send my own.&quot;

The pair started to exchange messages on a train station platform; messages which got gradually more flirty.

&quot;Eventually she asked me if I fancied a quickie in the toilets at the station we were travelling to.

&quot;It happened, but I never saw her again.&quot;

Since that day Jon - who claims to have had Toothing success five times - has set up a website dedicated to the practice but he admits it takes a degree of perseverance.

==Aftermath==

On April 4, 2005, the creators of the forum admitted that the whole thing was a hoax. Though the concept of toothing is possible, the hoaxers never intended for it to turn into something real. The couple said: &quot;It&#x27;s like going into a crowded nightclub, throwing a brick at the dance floor with a love letter attached, and hoping that the person it hits will agree to sleep with you.&quot; When announcing the hoax, Curran and Byron reassured that toothing was nothing more than a practical joke gone too far and despite all the articles in newspapers and tabloids, &quot;no one has ever ever, ever toothed.&quot; Shanna Petersen, a sexologist, disagreed with the hoaxers&#x27; statement that no-one has ever toothed: &quot;It&#x27;s simple, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of guts and rejection is nowhere as personal. Of course it&#x27;s popular. Show people a new way through which they have a chance to have more sex and they&#x27;ll do it. No matter how much effort goes into it or how meager the results.&quot; Multiple forums were in fact created throughout Europe, Asia and America within months of the original post of toothing. People signed up to the forums looking for good locations in their area to tooth, and to share their toothing stories with other members. There have later been real Bluetooth dating devices to hit the market.

University of Bath psychologist Linda Blair said the practice of toothing is down to the human need to take risks: &quot;I think we protect ourselves too much in modern society, and risk is a human need. We need motivation. In some ways this is a tame way of picking people up, it&#x27;s almost a natural follow up from randomly picking people&#x27;s names out of the phone book. It&#x27;s voluntary at all stages, and has choice. As long as that&#x27;s there and it&#x27;s legal, then people should be able to do what they want.&quot; Sue Peters of the Terrence Higgins Trust worried that anonymous sex made possible by toothing would cause an increase of sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia in the United Kingdom. University of Amsterdam sociologist Albert Benschop researched the hoax. He said toothing is &quot;the next logical step&quot; in dating and that the &quot;old game is just adapting to new times&quot;. Benschop added that toothing is &quot;just like picking up people in bars but without the silly time-consuming conventions of decorum that people are obliged to keep to these days. This is much more direct. You both know what you want.&quot; He also sees it as a way for people &quot;to satisfy their need for intimacy. As long as it helps people out of loneliness and gives them more to enjoy in life, I think it&#x27;s a very good development.&quot;

The term &quot;toothing&quot; was included in the 2006 version of &quot;The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English&quot;. It was described as an &quot;anonymous casual sexual activity with any partner arranged over Bluetooth radio technology enabled mobile phones.&quot; In addition, toothing is listed in the &quot;Sex Slang&quot; dictionary, authored by Tom Dalzell and Terry Victor, with an explanation similar to the one in the &quot;New Partridge Dictionary&quot;. Toothing was referenced in an episode of the American television series &quot;&quot;, called &quot;Killer Date&quot;, that aired in the United States on April 18, 2005.

<doc id="562096" wikidata="Q4738005" url="?curid=562096" title="Alveston">
<text>Alveston is a village, civil parish and former royal manor in South Gloucestershire, England, inhabited in 2014 by about 3,000 people. The village lies south of Thornbury and north of Bristol. Alveston is twinned with Courville sur Eure, France. The civil parish also includes the villages of Rudgeway and Earthcott.

==Neolithic to Bronze Age==

A scheduled Round barrow is situated next to Vattingstone Lane on the summit of the prominent hill called Alveston Down. The barrow survives as a circular flat-topped mound measuring approximately in diameter and high.

The barrow is known in old documents by the place name &#x27;Langeley&#x27; and is mentioned in charters as being re-purposed as a moot/ meeting place for the Anglo-Saxon &#x27;Langeley Hundred&#x27;. It was partially excavated in 1890 when a primary deposit of ashes and burnt bone was discovered beneath a covering of sand and small stones.
==Iron Age==

A ritual deposit of bones, dating to about 2000 years ago, has been found in a cave in the village. The remains of at least seven humans have been excavated. At least one skull showed signs that it had been pole-axed and then smashed inwards. An adult human femur had been split lengthwise so that the bone marrow could be scraped out. This finding is evidence of cannibalism, which is also suspected from other Iron Age deposits in Britain. Many bones of dogs, and a few cattle and possibly one bear bone, were also found.

==Descent of the manor==

===Domesday Book===

The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded the following entry for Alveston: . Translated as follows: &quot;In Langeley Hundred Earl Harold held Alveston. There were there 10 hides in demesne, 1 plough-team, 23 villeins, 5 bordars for whom there were 22 plough-teams, 2 serfs. There...2 plough-teams, 5 serfs. It returned £12...&quot; This was a very large manor, of 35 households in total. As the manor had been held by King Harold Godwinson it was seized into the royal demesne by William the Conqueror and remained in use as a royal hunting park until 1149.

===Illness of William Rufus===
Early in March 1093 King William II (1087–1100) was at the royal manor of Alveston, possibly awaiting his passage across the River Severn to Wales via the Aust ferry. He was suddenly attacked by a serious illness, thought to have been a disorder of the stomach or bowels. He was immediately rushed to Gloucester Castle 25 miles to the north, near which the monks of Gloucester Abbey were relied upon to provide a medical cure. It was believed the illness had been brought on as a result of the king&#x27;s sinful behaviour and he determined to repent and make amends. This illness contracted at Alveston thus resulted in the issuance of a charter which elaborated the king&#x27;s coronation pledge, akin to a charter of liberties. He pledged to protect and defend the church, to abolish simony, to abolish unjust laws and deter wrong-doers. He ordered the release of prisoners, remission of debts and all offences against himself he pardoned. He was confined to his chamber for the whole of Lent, covering the period 2 March to 17 April 1093. On 6 March he consented to appoint Anselm Abbot of Bec as Archbishop of Canterbury, which he had previously strongly opposed.

===FitzWarin===
In 1149 it was granted by Henry Plantagenet, then heir to the throne of King Stephen (1135–1154) to Fulk I FitzWarin (died 1171), a powerful Marcher Lord from Shropshire. In 1160 Fulk was in charge of arming and provisioning for King Henry II (1154–1189) Dover Castle, the second most important fortress in England after the Tower of London. Henry trusted Fulk and valued his services. The grant was a reward for Fulk&#x27;s loyalty to the cause of Henry&#x27;s mother the Empress Matilda in the civil war with &quot;The Usurper&quot; Stephen.

Alveston was inherited in 1171 by Fulk&#x27;s son Fulk II. During the Barons&#x27; wars of the reign of King John (1199–1216) which led up to Magna Carta signed in 1215, Fulk II&#x27;s son and heir Fulk III FitzWarin (died 1258) rebelled, and the manor escheated to the crown and passed temporarily into the stewardship of Hugh de Nevill. In 1204 Fulk III regained possession, but on 30 June 1216 King John ordered that Alveston should be seized once again from Fulk III FitzWarin. On 15 January 1230 King Henry III granted the park of Alveston back to Fulk III FitzWarin, and Fulk is recorded as having incurred a debt of 300 marks for this grant As a royal favour the king pardoned Fulk 200 marks of this debt.

Clearly Fulk was then in royal favour as in June 1234 he received from the king a gift of three deer from the royal Forest of Cannock. In September he received two bucks and eight does from the royal Forest of Braden, north Wiltshire, to help him to stock his deer park at Alveston. In 1236 Fulk was given another six does from Braden and six more from the Forest of Selwood, again to help him stock his park at Alveston. In November 1246 the king gave Fulk another six bucks and ten does for the same purpose. In 1249 Fulk III became involved in a lengthy legal dispute brought against him by Nicholas Poyntz, his near neighbour from Iron Acton who had accused Fulk of expelling him from the common pasture of Tockington, which adjoined Alveston manor.

Fulk IV FitzWarin fell at the Battle of Lewes in 1264, loyally supporting King Henry III in his struggle against the barons. He left his son and heir a minor, Fulk V (died 1314). Fulk V was awarded in Wardship, probably by Simon de Montfort, victor of Lewes, to Peter de Montfort (died 1265), &quot;The Nemesis of the Marcher Lords&quot;. He was rescued from this unpleasant position by his warder&#x27;s death at the Battle of Evesham following which King Henry III re-granted him in wardship to the Fitzwarin&#x27;s long-time friend Hamo le Strange. In 1273 Fulk V attained his majority of 21 years of age and gained possession of his father&#x27;s lands including Alveston.

====Legend of Fouke le Warin====
The early 14th-century legend, based on a lost 13th-century ancestral romance relates as follows, regarding the donation of Alveston (&quot;Alleston&quot;) to Fulk by King Henry (translated from French):

King Henry called Fulk, and made him constable of all his host; and placed under his command all the force of his land, and that he should take people enough and go to the march, and drive thence Jervard Droyndoun and his power
out of the march. Thus was Fulk made master over all; for he was strong and courageous. The king remained at Gloucester; for he was ailing, and not in a condition for labour. Jervard had taken entirely the whole march from Chester to Worcester, and he had disinherited all the barons of the march. Sir Fulk, with the king&#x27;s host, gave many fierce assaults to Jervard ; and in a battle near Hereford, at Wormeslow, made him fly and quit the field. But before he fled, many were killed on both sides. Fierce and hard war between Fulk and the prince lasted four years, until at the request of the king of France a love-day was taken at Shrewsbury between the king and Jervard the prince, and they embraced mutually and came to an agreement. And the prince restored to the barons of the march all the lands which he had taken from them, and restored Ellesmere to the king; but for no gold would he render White-Town and Maelor. &quot; Fulk,&quot; said the king, &quot; since you have lost White-Town and Maelor, I give you instead Alleston and all the honour which belongs to it, to hold for ever.&quot; Fulk thanked him dearly.

Furthermore:
&quot;Cesti Fouke fust bon viaundour e large; e fesoit turner le real chemyn par mi sa sale a soun maner de Alleston, pur ce que nul estraunge y dust passer s&#x27;il n&#x27;avoit viaunde ou herbergage ou autre honour ou bien du suen&quot;.
(This Fulk was very hospitable and liberal; and he caused the king&#x27;s road to be turned through his hall at his manor of Alleston, in order that no stranger might pass there without having meat or lodging or other honour or goods of his)&quot;.

===De Gloucester===
On 28 September 1309 Fulk V obtained royal licence to grant the manor of Alveston, which was held in-chief from the king, to Walter de Gloucester (died 1310) for life. Walter was Sheriff of Somerset &amp; Dorset 1293–1298 and in 1309 Escheator &quot;citra Trentam&quot; (&quot;on this side of the River Trent&quot;). Little is known of the origin or history of this family, but Sir Robert Atkyns (died 1711) in his &quot;History of Gloucestershire&quot; stated him to be a younger son of Fulk FitzWarin, yet failed to explain his deduction. He may in fact have been the son-in-law of Fulk as his widow is recorded with the name of &quot;Margaret Waryn&quot; and was still alive in 1322, as the Inquisition &quot;post mortem&quot; of Walter&#x27;s son Walter (died 1322) (sometime Escheator of Gloucestershire)states her to have been then holding in dower 1/3rd of the manor of Alveston. The grant to Walter (died 1310) in 1309 was in fact made, contrary to the licence, &quot;in fee&quot; (i.e. hereditable) and Walter&#x27;s grandson, another Walter de Gloucester (died 1360) was still in possession of the manor of Alveston in 1340/1. The trespass of obtaining a grant in fee without licence to alienate a tenancy-in-chief was pardoned on 28 July 1340 to Walter of Gloucester on payment of a fine.

===Corbet===

The de Gloucester manors of Alveston and &quot;Urcott&quot; (Earthcott Green) together with Langley Hundred were settled during the reign of King Edward III (1327–1377) onto the heir of Peter Corbet (died 1363) of Hope, Salop., and later of Siston. Walter FitzWalter de Gloucester (died 1360) had married Petronilla (or Pernel), one of the three daughters of William Corbet (born c. 1280) of Chaddesley Corbett, Worcs., and Siston, Gloucestershire. In 1342 following this marriage Walter settled the manors of Alveston and Erdecote and the hundred of &quot;Langele&quot; on himself and his wife for their joint lives and the life of the survivor of them, with remainder to their joint issue, and in default of such issue with remainder to Peter Corbet of Syston and his heirs. Peter Corbet (died 1362) was the next younger brother and heir of William Corbet (who presumably was dead by then and unlike his brother had no male offspring) and was therefore Petronilla&#x27;s uncle. Walter and Petronilla&#x27;s son Peter de Gloucester married a certain Alice. Peter de Gloucester died childless before 1370, as is apparent from the fact that the settlement made by his father had taken effect by then in granting the de Gloucester lands, including Alveston, to John Corbet (died 1370), the grandson and heir of Sir Peter Corbet (died 1362). John Corbet had outlived his father William who had a short life, but himself died aged only 17, leaving his triplet William Corbet (1353–1378) his heir, who in turn also died young in 1378 aged only 25. Alice de Gloucester, widow of Peter de Gloucester, was then still alive and was recorded in the Inquisition &quot;post mortem&quot; of William Corbet dated 1378 as holding 1/3rd dower share of Alveston. The young William Corbet had become a merchant dealing in the wool-trade as on his death he owed the very great sum of £320 for merchandise received to the Bristol merchant and clothier John Canynges (died 1405), father of the great Bristol merchant William II Canynges (died 1474). This sum had been incurred before 1375, as a record from that year of Extent for Debts heard before Walter Frampton, Mayor of the Staple of Bristol reveals, and represented several multiples of the annual value of the revenue from all the Corbet family&#x27;s Gloucestershire manors, and clearly placed the inheritance in a precarious position. Indeed, John Canynges and his business partner William Cheddar the Elder had taken temporary possession of William Corbet&#x27;s 2/3rds occupancy of Alveston manor as security for their debt, and later granted it by gift to William II Canynges (died 1474) who held it from them as a &quot;free tenant&quot;. Young William&#x27;s own heir was his sister Margaret Corbet (died 1398), who brought the Corbet manors to her husband William Wyriott (died 1379) from Pembrokeshire. Wyriott died before the couple had produced any offspring and Margaret married secondly Sir Gilbert Denys (died 1422) from Waterton in the lordship of Coity, Glamorgan. Thus the manors of Alveston, Earthcott Green and Siston together with Langley Hundred entered into the possession of the Denys family.

===Denys===
The widow Alice de Gloucester remarried to Alan Eckylsale and the couple remitted all their rights in her 1/3 dower in Alveston in consideration of 100 marks paid by Gilbert Denys and Margaret. who thus had obtained vacant possession of the manor.

==Modern Alveston==
In the 19th century, the village of Alveston was centred on Church Farm, on the lane leading from Rudgeway to Iron Acton. Some people consider the modern Alveston to be centred on the Ship Inn. The Ship Inn at Alveston is an old Coaching House which dates back to 1589. In the 19th century, the area around the Ship Inn was known as Alveston Green. Most consider Alveston Parade – a small shopping area – to be the centre.

The main road to Gloucester originally passed the Ship Inn, before turning east to join the current line of the A38 trunk road. A short bypass was added during the 20th century.

Alveston Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1903/4. The club was wound up in 1948.

==Marlwood School==
Marlwood School is a mixed comprehensive which serves Alveston and the surrounding area. The school was founded in 1069 as Thornbury&#x27;s grammar school , but relocated to its present site in 1972 when it became comprehensive. It is so named because of its location adjacent to the Marlwood Estate. The school marked its 400th anniversary in 2006 and several events took place in celebration.

==Two St Helens Churches==
The ruins of Alveston Old Church of St Helens is situated in Rudgeway, south of the modern village of Alveston, along the A38. The separate parish of Alveston was not formed until 1846, before which time Alveston manor was within the parish of Olveston. Following the development and growth of the modern village of Alveston some distance away from the manor house and the Church of St. Helen next door to it, it was determined by the village authorities to build a new church, again dedicated to St Helen, nearer to the new village. The old church fell into disuse and decay, and today only the tower and south aisle wall remain standing, although the structure has been restored to a high standard by the aerospace company Rolls-Royce plc, the owner of both the former manor house, now used for corporate hospitality and known as &quot;Old Church Farm&quot;, and the church itself.

<doc id="562097" wikidata="Q64027" url="?curid=562097" title="Nyon">
<text>Nyon (; historically German: or and Italian: , ) is a municipality in Nyon District in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. It is located some 25 kilometers north east of Geneva&#x27;s city centre, and since the 1970s it has become part of the Geneva metropolitan area. It lies on the shores of Lake Geneva and is the seat of Nyon District. The town has () a population of and is famous in the sporting world for being the headquarters of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and the European Club Association (ECA). It is connected to the rest of Switzerland by way of the Route Suisse, the A1 Motorway and the railways of the &quot;Arc Lémanique&quot;.

==Name==
Nyon derives from one of the names used by the Romans for the town, &quot;Noviodunum&quot; or &quot;Noiodunum&quot;. Other names for the town, particularly of colonies placed there, are &quot;Colonia Iulia Equestris&quot; or &quot;Colonia Julia Equestris&quot;, &quot;Colonia Equestris Noiodunum&quot;, &quot;Equestris&quot;, &quot;Civitas Equestrium&quot;, and &quot;Civitas Equestrium Noiodunum&quot;.

==History==
Nyon is first mentioned around 367–407 as &quot;civitas Equestrium id est Noiodunus&quot; (in the &quot;Notitia Galliarum&quot;). In 1236, it was mentioned as &quot;Neveduni&quot; and in 1292 as &quot;Nyons&quot;.

===Pre-Roman settlements===
A few scattered neolithic items were discovered in the 19th century. North of the city, some bronze rings and the ruins of a Bronze Age settlement were discovered.

===Noviodunum===

It was founded by the Romans between 50 and 44 BC under the name of Colonia Iulia Equestris or Colonia Equestris Noiodunum, the urban center of which was called Noviodunum. It grew to be one of the most important Roman colonies in modern-day Switzerland, with a forum, a basilica and an amphitheater that was discovered only recently, in 1996, when digging for the construction of a new building.

At Roman contact, the country round the town was held by the Helvetii. The town&#x27;s importance is reflected in its numerous mentions in ancient sources. The Antonine Itineraries place the town on the road from Geneva to Lacus Lausonius (near Lausanne). It is first mentioned by Pliny (&quot;H.N.&quot;, iv. 7), and then by Ptolemy (ii. 9), who assigns it to the Sequani. Pliny and Ptolemy simply name it Equestris; and so it is named in the Itineraries. On some inscriptions it is called &quot;Civ. Equestrium&quot; (short for Civitas Equestrium), and &quot;Col. Julia Equ.&quot; (short for Colonia Julia Equestris) from which some have concluded that it was founded by Julius Caesar. In the Notitia it is called &quot;Civ. Equestrium Noiodunum&quot; (short for Civitas Equestrium Noiodunum). The district in which Nyon stands is called &quot;Pagus Equestricus&quot; in a document of the year 1011; and it is said that the people of the country as of the 18th century still called this district &quot;Enquestre&quot;. (D&#x27;Anville, Notice, &amp;c.; Walckenaer, Géographie, &amp;c., des Gaules, vol. ii. p. 316.)

Noviodunum was part of a loose network of settlements that radiated out from Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France) and helped to control the Rhone Valley. It served, along with other Roman colonies in the area, to control the Helvetii who were settled in the area against their will after their defeat at the Battle of Bibracte in 58 BC.

A rectangular grid pattern divided the area of the wall-less city. A monumental center, housing everything needed for the economic, religious and social life of the colony, was established. Only portions of this first forum have been discovered. At its east end was a two-story basilica. Grid-like residential streets radiated out from the center.

Under Tiberius, the forum was expanded and redesigned into a familiar pattern for the provinces. The sacred area was surrounded on three sides by colonnades, which were built on half-sunken Cryptoporticus. Two outbuildings, including most likely the seat of the Curia, flanked the building. A market building (macellum) with a central courtyard around which were the sales rooms, and the baths (tepidarium with geometric shapes and mosaics) were renovated. The forum witnessed further transformations, particularly the establishment of another large building. During the same building phase a large mosaic on the central part of the north portico was built.

The amphitheater, which was discovered in 1996, was probably built in the early 2nd century AD. Its arena, which was flanked by two prisons and provided with sewers, is about . The ruins of the theater, that should have been in the Colonia, have not been discovered.

The residential quarters consisted of modest homes, in addition to some domi with gardens and pools. The buildings were originally made of wood and clay, but after the mid-1st century AD were built from masonry. Some villa suburbana stood in the west of the village, while the artisan and merchant quarter, presumably, developed in the southwest. A aqueduct, which ran from the Divonne area to the colony, provided the water supply. Sewage canals, that followed the road networks, dumped sewage into the lake.

===Decline of the Roman colonia===
After a long period of peace and prosperity, signs of crisis and general insecurity were increasing in the early 3rd century. As a result of Alamanni invasions of 259 or 260 AD, the forum and the public buildings in the city were razed. The stone blocks were scattered all over the Lake Geneva region. The stones were re-used as building material, especially in Geneva, where about 300 were used in the construction of the wall. But the settlement was not abandoned. Nyon-Noviodunum, which had already lost much of its prestige and reputation was as a regional capital, now separated from Geneva. Geneva became the center and seat of the diocese which initially fought to administer the territory that had been part of the Colonia.

===Medieval Nyon===
During the Carolingian era, Nyon belonged to the county of Geneva. In a 926 charter, Rudolph II of Burgundy mentioned that this area was under a &quot;comes de pago Equestrico&quot;. During the Second Kingdom of Burgundy, Nyon became independent from Geneva. In 1032, Rudolf III granted Nyon to the Archbishop of Besançon. The bishop granted Nyon to the Lord of Prangins as a fief. After 1130, Humbert de Cossonay, the Lord of Prangins, held his court in Nyon. A market was built in 1211. In 1272, the Archbishop of Besançon confirmed Philip of Savoy&#x27;s right to administer high justice in Nyon. In 1279, Aymon of Prangins unsuccessfully rebelled against the counts of Savoy, but was forced to acknowledge Savoy authority over him and Nyon.

The Castle is first mentioned in 1272, but probably dates back to the Lords of Prangins. It was rebuilt by Louis I of Savoy in 1463. The rectangular edifice was built in a variety of styles. Around the same time, the square César Tower or Tour de Rive (now a residence), was built to defend the city.

In 1293, Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, and his brother Louis I, Baron of Vaud, conquered the city by besieging it from both the land and the lake. They confirmed the town rights which had been granted to Nyon by Aymon of Prangins, and extended further rights and freedoms. It became one of the four &quot;bonnes villes&quot; of Canton Vaud. In 1294, Louis I began to expand Nyon as a center of his power after Amadeus granted his share of the conquest to Louis. He created a court and a mint, which minted coins for the lords of Vaud between 1286 and 1350. In 1323 Louis II, granted the so-called mountains of Nyon, i.e. pastures and forests in the area of Arzier and Saint-Cergue, to Nyon. In 1359 Nyon lost importance after Amadeus VI acquired rights over the entire Vaud. In 1364 the town charter of Morges replaced the charter in Nyon. This change was reconfirmed in 1439. Under the new charter, the town gained greater self-sufficiency. The mint in Nyon reopened in 1430. In 1530 the Swiss Confederation invaded Vaud and acquired Nyon. Then in 1536, Nyon surrendered again to Bern without a fight as Bernese troops marched through to support Geneva.

Starting in 1323, the municipal government was composed of eight procurators and a mayor. A little later the government was replaced by a community meeting which was headed by two mayors (Syndics). The Town Hall is first mentioned in 1508.

A Benedictine priory was founded in the first half of the 12th century in Nyon. In 1244 it was given to the Augustinian order. The last prior, before the Reformation in 1535 was Aymon de Gingins, who was also the abbot of Bonmont and the selected Bishop of Geneva.

In 1295–96, Louis I, Duke of Savoy, built a Franciscan monastery under the patronage of St. Francis, in which several members of the House of Savoy were buried. In 1530, Bern and Fribourg plundered the monastery for the first time, and Bern destroyed all the pictures of saints. In 1536, it was burned by the withdrawing Savoy garrison.

In 1110 Geneva granted authority over the church of Notre-Dame to the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Oyend (Saint-Claude). The church was built with material from the Roman period and replaced an earlier Christian church. The choir dates from the 12th century, and the nave was built in 1448. The vault and the side chapels were built in 1470–81.

Situated outside the city walls was the church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste, also known as Corps-Saints. The church is first mentioned in 1346. By 1412, it was administered by the Augustinian Priory. Until the Reformation it was a pilgrimage site where the relics of the martyrs of the Theban Legion were revered. Bern ordered the church destroyed in 1537.

===Early Modern Nyon===

Nyon was raised to the status of administrative center of a &quot;Vogtei&quot; of Bern in 1536. It remained the seat of the vogt until the Vaud revolution of 1798. In 1568, a yearly market took place for the first time. In 1574–80 the castle was converted into the seat of the bailiff. It was renovated several times in the following centuries. The municipal government added a Council of Fifty in 1558 and in 1578, an inner council of Twenty-four. The inner council was made up of nobles, burghers and inhabitants. Later the councils became a Council of Twelve and a council of Twenty-Four, which was headed by a knight banneret.

In 1570, Theodore Beza headed the regional assembly of Protestant refugee clergymen in Nyon. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, many Huguenots fled to Nyon. In 1688, they founded the &quot;Bourse française&quot; to help other refugees.

Nyon remained an important transhipment point for trade along Lake Geneva and from France and Italy. Grain and wood came from Burgundy and Franche-Comté through the Col de la Givrine and Saint-Cergue on to Geneva. In 1537–76, the customs post of Nyon was the most profitable in the bailiwick. Over the following centuries, trade through Nyon remained very profitable and by 1772–73, it was again the highest in the region. In the 18th century, trade and commerce grew strongly. The flow of goods allowed four (after 1738, five) yearly markets. A granary was built in the 18th century. The Bernese rebuilt the Asse canal system to drive tanneries, sawmills and mills. The Faïencerie Baylon earthenware factory was founded in 1769. It was followed by the Jacob Dortu and Ferdinand Müller porcelain factory in 1781, both of which contributed Nyon&#x27;s reputation for fine ceramics.

With the profits of the Early Modern era, many of the public buildings of Nyon were rebuilt or expanded. Following the suppression of the monasteries, in 1539, the town hospital moved into the offices of the Augustinian convent and received money from the closed monasteries. Hans-Ulrich Heldt rebuilt the college, the original building was from 1559, in 1786 in a neoclassical style. The church of Notre-Dame was rebuilt several times between 1661 and 1718. The medieval city walls and gates were demolished in 1718. The town hall was rebuilt in 1773. In 1720, Louis de Saint-Georges, a minister of the English king, built Changins Castle.

The city was one of the most active centers of the revolutionary movement in the Vaud region. The councils of Nyon formed an oversight committee and refused to pay homage to Bern on 10 January 1798. A few days later, they secured the support of the French General in support of the independence of Canton Vaud. When this proclamation of support was brought from Nyon to Lausanne, on 24 January 1798, it finally led to the Vaudois revolution.

From 1798 to 1803, it was in the canton of Léman of the Helvetic Republic as district capital.

===Modern Nyon===
In the first half of the 19th century, the city continued with the demolition of the fortifications, but left wall remains at the Promenade des Marronniers and by the tower of Notre Dame. During the 19th century the Reformed parish church was rebuilt several times. The Catholic Church was consecrated in 1839, and a chapel for the &quot;Église libre&quot; (Free Church) was finished in 1872.

In 1858, a station of the railway line Lausanne–Geneva was built in north of Nyon. New housing developments sprung up around this station, and the city began to spread. The railroads Nyon–Crassier–Divonne (1905) and Nyon–Saint-Cergue–Morez (1916) connected Nyon with its hinterland. To meet the needs of the economy, the shipping industry and the emerging tourism industry, a port was built in 1838 and a quay was added in 1873. By the middle of the 19th century, a major source of income was the sale of timber from the commons forest. Other industries included tanneries (closed in 1925), carpentry, saw mills (until 1935), mills (including Andre &amp; Cie.), cooperages and a soap factory. The Faïencerie Baylon closed in 1828. The porcelain factory, Müller et Dortu temporarily closed in 1813, then resumed production of ceramics in the Art Nouveau style in 1878. From then on until 1980 they produced Stoneware. Other industries in Nyon include the pasta factory Sangal SA (1860–1996), Zyma (1906, since 1996, Swiss Novartis Consumer Health), Stellram (hard metal treatment, 1940–99), Cherix et Filanosa SA (printing and graphic arts, 1932) and several tool factories. Starting in 1966, the companies stopped using the local locks and dams for hydropower and by 1974 they had disappeared from the Asse river.

In 1937, it hosted the Nyon Conference.

<text>The Canada First movement is a Canadian nationalist movement organized in 1868 that promoted the British Protestant component as central to Canadian identity. It was at first supported by Goldwin Smith and Edward Blake. Ontario residents, George Denison, Charles Mair, William Alexander Foster and Robert Grant Haliburton founded the movement. 

John Christian Schultz, Canadian Party founder, became a leading member of the Canadian Party and was a chief opponent of Louis Riel.
The execution of Thomas Scott during the 1870 Red River Rebellion was a major catalyst in the formation of the Canada First movement. Caught in the middle of the rebellion, Schultz and Mair narrowly escaped execution themselves. Upon their return to Ontario the two men were featured prominently in a massive Toronto protest organized by the Canada Firsters. Tapping into Orange Protestant outrage over the killing of Scott the movement&#x27;s leaders stressed the theme of national betrayal at the hands of the Red River rebels and Louis Riel.

On the occasion of an 1874 by-election in the Federal district of West Toronto, the Canada First movement became an official political party known as the Canadian National Association. Although the party failed to nominate a candidate, they released a party-platform that called for the &quot;British Connection, Consolidation of the Empire and in the meantime a voice in treaties affecting Canada.&quot; Wanting a greater voice and autonomy for Canada in conducting its own foreign policy the movement heralded the Imperial Federation movement.

Although the party counted among its early supporters former Ontario Premier and prominent Liberal Edward Blake, Blake&#x27;s decision to accept a position in Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s government in 1875 led to the party&#x27;s quick collapse. By 1876 their weekly newspaper organ &quot;The Nation&quot;, edited by Charles Lindsey, had closed.

In 2025, both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre used the phrase to describe their policies of retaliatory tariffs against President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2025 tariffs and comments of Canada being the &quot;51st state&quot;.

<text>The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is an American financial services company providing insurance and banking products exclusively to members of the military, veterans and their families. It was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas, by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance, when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group. 

USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, occupying a former horse farm. USAA Federal Savings Bank, which provides banking services, is headquartered on a campus in Phoenix, Arizona as of April 2024.

USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their families. The company ranked No. 96 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue and appeared on Fortune&#x27;s 2021 Blue Ribbon list of companies, placing No. 355 on the Fortune Global 500, No. 94 on the Fortune 500, No. 55 on the 100 Best Companies to Work For and World’s Most Admired Companies. At the end of 2020, it had more than 13 million members.

==History==
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company was formed based on a meeting of 25 United States Army officers on June 20, 1922, at the Gunter Hotel in San Antonio, Texas, to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance. Despite initial success, by the late 1920s, a dispute between competing factions for control of the company threatened its long-term viability. The issue was resolved when feuding members agreed to hire a leader from outside, resulting in the 1928 appointment of Major General Ernest Hinds as general manager and secretary-treasurer. Hinds provided stability and remained in the position until his death in 1941.

USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s, the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. It launched a toll-free number in 1978, and Internet sales and service in June 1999 via its website.

USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA&#x27;s investment products, most bank deposit products and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.

In 2015, USAA employed more than 32,000 people at its offices throughout the world.

On July 26, 2019, the Charles Schwab Corporation announced it would acquire USAA&#x27;s investment management and brokerage accounts for $1.8 billion. The deal with Charles Schwab closed on May 26, 2020.

==Lines of business==
===Property, casualty, and life insurance===
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters&#x27; insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&amp;C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA&#x27;s life insurance policies, while not unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause.

===Banking===
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad and mobile devices with Google&#x27;s Android operating system.

Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union and Navy Federal Credit Union.

===Investing and financial planning===
USAA members are referred to its strategic partners, Charles Schwab Corporation and Victory Capital, for other investment services such as brokerage and trading, mutual funds and ETFs.

==Target market==
USAA&#x27;s mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.

Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996. For a short time, USAA also offered enrollment for federal law enforcement. In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military. As of 2022, USAA has also extended membership to those who have a general discharge from the military.

==Leadership==
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Vice Admiral James M. Zortman (Ret.), USAA&#x27;s board of directors named Wayne Peacock CEO-elect in January 2020 to succeed former CEO Stuart Parker. Peacock became CEO in February 2020 and is the first USAA CEO who is not a veteran of the armed forces. USAA has announced that on April 2, 2025, Juan C. Andrade will step in as the new CEO.

USAA former CEOs include retired Air Force brigadier general Robert F. McDermott, who took the position in 1969. The USAA office building in San Antonio was constructed under his tenure, and McDermott was behind USAA&#x27;s shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone. He was succeeded as CEO in 1993 by retired Air Force General Robert T. Herres. It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services. Following General Herres as CEO as of 2000 was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly.

His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA&#x27;s first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007. The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, &quot;I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, &#x27;Guess what? The permanent CEO is you&#x27;.&quot;

==Locations==

Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix. USAA also has offices in Chesapeake, Virginia; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Plano, Texas; and Tampa, Florida. Internationally, USAA has offices in London and Frankfurt. The company has numerous office buildings in the Phoenix area. Their largest office buildings are on a 400-acre multi-use north Phoenix campus built in 2017, these buildings contain 4,500 workers. In May 2019 USAA opened another Phoenix office located at 25700 N Norterra Pkwy in north Phoenix that will eventually house 1,100 employees primarily software developers.

On May 27, 2021, USAA announced that it will be adding an additional 750 employees to its 100-employee base in Charlotte, North Carolina. The company will be leasing of space in a new building in South End called The Square. Company employees started moving in at the end of 2021. In June 2022, USAA purchased The Square from developer Beacon Partners for $97 million. Currently the company has 500 employees in the building and they occupy 2 out of the 6 floors they originally agreed to lease of the 10 story building.

== Bank secrecy violations == 
On March 17, 2022, The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) announced a $140 million &quot;civil money penalty&quot; against USAA Federal Savings Bank for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.

<text>The NEC e616 mobile phone is a handheld 3G phone from NEC Corporation.

==Rechargeable battery==

The e616 takes Lithium ion batteries, which are available in different capacities:

* 780 mA·h standard battery (always included) tested standby time in 3G network : 6–12 h depending on use of the phone
* 1360 mA·h high capacity battery (sometimes included) tested standby time in 3G network : 12–24 h depending on use of the phone

== Usage notes ==
Batteries should always be recharged in the recharger and not within the mobile phone. Recharging in the mobile takes longer and the standby time will be halved. The short standby time and recharging error may be caused by faulty firmware or a faulty 3G network. In addition the battery time can be increased by turning off the GPS and vibra call alert, and by turning down the backlight of the display. Testing has revealed that using the phone in 2G network will provide 3-4 times the standby time than using it in 3G networks. 

==Media==

===Wallpapers===
The screen size of the e616 is 176x240 pixels, but the wallpaper should be restricted to 176×200 pixels to allow for the status bar at the top and the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.

===Ringtones===
The NEC e616 supports polyphonic ringtones.

==Information Codes==

Special codes supported by the e616 include:
**#06# shows IMEI number
**#2820# shows Software Version
**#3210# shows SP lock info
**#4960# shows sim lock info
**#7320# shows net lock info
**#8140# shows corporate lock info
**73738# master reset 
*#7320*(8 digits password)# release the Net Lock, password required
**#2634# unlock APN 1-2 and the GPRS attach.

The codes are entered in the same way as a normal phone number.

== Impact ==
NECTEC has used green technology in the field of printing. This has led to the foundation of Thailand Organic and Printed Electronics Innovation Centre (TOPIC). NECTEC along with public and private sectors have researched the technical feasibility of using organic electronics in printing ink. It has successfully developed graphene-based conductive ink in 2011. The ink has five times more conductivity than a typical ink. It is also cheap, contains no contamination, and is suitable for various applications.
It has also developed a software called &quot;Size-Thai&quot; that uses 3-D body scan to measure the anatomical dimensions of Thai people. This makes Thailand the second nation in Asia to use such a software after Japan. It is expected to reduce wastage and help garment retailers to reduce losses. It also has business applications like &quot;virtual-try on&quot; and &quot;made to measure&quot;.

<doc id="562114" wikidata="Q4854873" url="?curid=562114" title="Banff and Buchan">
<text>Banff and Buchan is a committee area of the Aberdeenshire Council, Scotland, covering an area along the northern coast of the council area. The main towns are Banff and Fraserburgh. Fishing and agriculture are important industries, together with associated processing and service activity.

Banff and Buchan was also the name of a district of Grampian Region between 1975 and 1996. The district covered a much larger area than the modern committee area. Its council was based in Banff.

==History==
The area has a long history of human occupation. Prehistoric features include a large long barrow at Longman Hill south-east of Macduff, as well as Cairn Lee to the west of Longman Hill.

==Local government district==

The Banff and Buchan local government district was created on 16 May 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Banff and Buchan was one of five districts created within the Grampian region. The new district covered parts of the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Banffshire. It covered the whole area of twelve former districts and parts of another two, which were all abolished at the same time:

&quot;From Aberdeenshire&quot;
*Deer district
*Ellon district (parish of Cruden only)
*Fraserburgh burgh
*Peterhead burgh
*Rosehearty burgh
*Turriff burgh
*Turriff district

&quot;From Banffshire&quot;
*Aberchirder burgh
*Aberchirder district
*Banff burgh
*Banff district
*Cullen district (Fordyce electoral division only)
*Macduff burgh
*Portsoy burgh

The rest of Banffshire became part of the Moray district of the Grampian region. The new district was named Banff and Buchan, combining the names of the former county and town of Banff and the ancient province of Buchan, which had covered the parts of the district from Aberdeenshire.

The regions and districts created in 1975 were abolished in 1996, being replaced by council areas. The area of Banff and Buchan was merged with the Gordon and Kincardine and Deeside districts to become the new Aberdeenshire council area.

===Political control===
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence, a majority of the seats were held by independent councillors:
===Premises===

The district council met at Banff Sheriff Court, the courthouse (built 1871) which had also served as the meeting place of the old Banffshire County Council. The district council had its main offices at St Leonard&#x27;s House on Sandyhill Road in Banff, which had also been the main offices of the former Banffshire County Council since 1934. It also used other offices inherited from its predecessors, notably including Banff Town House at 34 Low Street, formerly offices of Banff Town Council, and Arbuthnot House on Broad Street in Peterhead, formerly offices of Peterhead Town Council.

The offices passed to Aberdeenshire Council on local government reorganisation in 1996. St Leonard&#x27;s House and Banff Town House continue to be used as area offices.

==Committee area==
The successor Aberdeenshire Council established a number of area committees to discuss local matters. One is called Banff and Buchan, but covers a smaller area than the pre-1996 district. The committee area just covers the wards of Banff and District, Fraserburgh and District and Troup. Other parts of the pre-1996 district are included in the committee areas of Buchan (the area around Peterhead) and Formartine (the area around Turriff).

==Parliamentary constituencies==
The name is also used for the Banff and Buchan constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (at Westminster). This seat has been held since 2017 by David Duiguid of the Conservative Party who gained it from Dr Eilidh Whiteford of the Scottish National Party. From 1999 to 2011 Banff and Buchan was also used as a constituency of the Scottish Parliament (at Holyrood). Despite sharing the same name, the boundaries of the two constituencies differed after 2005.

<text>One Churchill Place is a 156 m tall skyscraper with 32 floors, serving as the headquarters of Barclays Bank. It is in the Docklands area of London Borough of Tower Hamlets in Canary Wharf. The building is the 13th-tallest office block in the United Kingdom and the sixth tallest building in the Docklands.

The building was formally opened in June 2005 by the Chairman of Barclays, Matthew Barrett, and merged Barclays offices across London into one building. The former corporate HQ was at 54 Lombard Street in the City of London.

Barclays occupies 100% of the building; floors 18-20 were previously leased to BGC Partners/Cantor Fitzgerald. Several floors were previously occupied by the Olympic Delivery Teams prior to 2012, and a portion of level 17 was occupied by the Metropolitan Police.

==Construction==

The building was designed by HOK International and constructed by Canary Wharf Contractors.

Designed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the building is constructed around four staircase columns with a large, central column containing the lifts and toilet facilities. The building manual states that there is enough room in these columns to contain everyone who works in the building, in the event of a security alert.

The building was planned to be 50 storeys in height, but was scaled down to 31 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

It is linked by walkways to the Canada Square shopping mall and Canary Wharf Underground station.

<text>The Mk 19 grenade launcher (pronounced Mark 19) is an American 40 mm belt-fed automatic grenade launcher that was first developed during the Vietnam War.

==Overview==

The Mk 19 is a belt-fed, blowback-operated, air-cooled, crew-served, fully-automatic weapon that is designed not to cook off. It fires 40 mm grenades at a cyclic rate of 325 to 375 rounds per minute, giving a practical rate of fire of 60 rounds per minute (rapid) and 40 rounds per minute (sustained). The weapon operates on the blowback principle, which uses the chamber pressure from each fired round to load and re-cock the weapon. The Mk 19 can launch its grenade at a maximum distance of , though its effective range to a point target is about , since the large rear leaf sight is only graduated as far. The nearest safe distance to launch the grenade is 310 meters in training and 75 meters in combat. Though the Mk 19 has a flash suppressor, it serves only to save the eyesight of its operator, not concealing the weapon&#x27;s position. For night operation, a picatinny rail quadrant sight can be added for thermal and night vision optics.

The Mk 19A is a man-portable crew-served weapon that can fire from a tripod-mounted position or from a vehicle mount, with the latter being the preferred method, as the weapon alone weighs . The primary ammunition for it is the high-explosive dual-purpose M430 grenade. On impact, the grenade can kill anyone within a radius of , and wound them within a radius of . It can also penetrate of rolled homogeneous armor with a direct hit (0-degree obliquity), which means it can penetrate most infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers. It is especially effective when used against enemy infantry formations. The ammunition comes in cans that hold a 32- or 48-grenade belt weighing , respectively. Due to its low recoil and comparatively light weight, it has been adapted for use on many different platforms, including small attack boats, fast attack vehicles such as the Humvee (HMMWV), AAV and Stryker, military jeeps, and a large variety of naval mounts.

The Mk 19 automatic grenade launcher replaced the earlier Mk 18 hand-cranked multiple grenade launcher. The 40 mm ammunition used (40×53 mm) is not interchangeable with that used in the M203 (40×46 mm). The M203 ammunition develops a lower chamber pressure, and resultant lower muzzle velocity and range, compared to ammunition loaded for the Mk 19. The Mk 19 fires from an open bolt. The rounds are mechanically fed onto the bolt face with the pull of the charging handles. When the trigger is pressed, the bolt closes, and the firing pin is released. The recoil blows back the bolt, feeds a new round onto the bolt face, which pushes the expended casing off the bolt face.

Production of the Mk 19 is managed by Saco Defense Industries (now a division of General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems).

In November 2014, General Dynamics entered into an agreement with Advanced Material Engineering Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Kinetics, to manufacture 40 mm high-velocity airburst ammunition for the U.S. military. The 40 mm airburst grenade uses a programmable, time-based fuse that computes and programs the detonation time into it, which counts down once fired to zero to detonate at the intended target point. The airburst ammunition is compatible with the Mk 19, which would give it greater effectiveness and lethality, particularly against concealed and defilade targets.

The Mk 19 is used as part of the Şahin counter unmanned air system (C-UAS) developed by Aselsan, which entered service with the Turkish Armed Forces in July 2022 and uses Atom 40 mm ammunition to detect and destroy mini and micro UAVs out to 700 meters.

==Variants==

&quot;Although the MK 19 is a recent entry into the Army’s inventory, development 
began in 1963. The first version was a hand-cranked, multiple grenade launcher 
called the MK 18. In 1966 the need for more firepower inspired the development of a 
self-powered 40-mm machine gun called the MK 19, MOD 0. This model was neither 
reliable nor safe enough for use as a military weapon system. Product improvements 
begun in 1971 resulted in the 1972 MOD 1, of which only six were produced. The 
MOD 1 performed effectively in Navy riverine patrol craft and broader applications 
for the MK 19 were found. In 1973 the Navy developed the MOD 2, which featured 
improved reliability, safety, and maintainability. In 1976 a complete redesign 
resulted in the MK 19, MOD 3, which the Army adopted in 1983. The Army now uses 
the MK 19 within the tactical environment for defense, retrograde, patrolling, rear 
area security, urban operations, and special operations.&quot;

<text>The University of Nottingham Medical School at Derby was opened in September 2003 by Dr John Reid, then Secretary of State for Health. It is part of the University of Nottingham and is located in the nearby city of Derby in the East Midlands of England. It offers a four-year Graduate Entry Medical (GEM) course (initially for 90 students) as well as a 3-year Undergraduate Medical Physiology and Therapeutics degree (available as a 4-year foundation degree) as well. It is currently led (2015- ) by Professor John Alcolado.

The medical school is attached to the Royal Derby Hospital and houses a lecture theatre, anatomy suite and clinical skills teaching facility. Additionally, students have assigned problem-based learning base rooms.

Entrance to the GEM course is via the GAMSAT examination followed by a structured interview process. Competition for places is fierce, with usually over 1200 students applying for the 90 places. The course accepts people from both science and non-science degree backgrounds.

The course consists of a -year pre-clinical phase which is centred on problem-based learning cases. Following successful completion of this course, students then join with the five-year course students for a -year clinical phase.

<text>() is a political party operating in the Isle of Man. Formed in 1962, it seeks to revoke the status of Man as a British self-governing Crown dependency and establish a completely sovereign state, which would be a republic.

It describes its aims as being:
It is alternatively called or subtitled &quot;The Manx Nationalist Party&quot;, but is not to be confused with the Manx National Party, which was a name used by another party.

==History==
Mec Vannin was formed in 1962 and has held minuted meetings since February 1964.

&#x27;s growth can be considered to be directly parallel to the Isle of Man&#x27;s status as a tax haven. In particular, they have campaigned against immigration to the island, particularly from England. This featured in their 2008 platform and policy:

:&quot;In a small island nation such as ours, in default of policies to control the growth of the finance sector, policies to control the size of the population are essential for the achievement of economic, ecological and cultural sustainability. The rapid and unnatural population increase, due to an open door policy on immigration, has increased the burden on the island&#x27;s infrastructure and environment whilst eroding the fabric of community life. As a result, Mec Vannin believes the immediate introduction of immigration controls to be a priority.&quot;

The party stated in the 1980s that it was concerned with &quot;the prospects of our survival as a nation, as a distinct Celtic community in its own right and with its own identity and independence&quot;.

In the 1976 election Mec Vannin put up ten candidates. Only one was successful though, Peter Craine. He remains the only person to have been a Member of the House of Keys (MHK), although several ex-members have gone on to become MHKs, such as Treasury Minister Allan Bell, Phil Gawne and Hazel Hannan. Peter Craine subsequently left the party, joining the short-lived breakaway Manx National Party which was formed in 1977 and disbanded in 1981.

They participated in the 1981 election also, in the Peel constituency.

===Additional policy===
Mec Vannin&#x27;s environmentalist policies include opposition to overuse of fossil fuels. They support further decentralisation of power within the island, to local councils.

Other policies include:
* Reforestation - by native deciduous species
* Fishing as &quot;a viable part of the economy&quot;, with stronger fisheries protection.
* Farming self-sufficiency for the Isle of Man.
* Revitalisation of Manx tourism
* A Manx university
* A socialised health service
* Separate Manx nationality:
*: &quot;Manx nationality must be defined by legislation and a Manx passport introduced, with Manx nationality being first citizenship. Whilst all residents would be eligible for Manx citizenship upon the introduction of legislation, subsequent new residents could only become citizens after due process of naturalisation. Only Manx citizens would be eligible to vote or to stand for representative public office.&quot;
* On customs union:
*: &quot;The right to determine indirect taxation, including VAT. This necessitates the cessation of the Customs and Excise Agreement.&quot;

&quot;Mec Vannin&quot; is also highly critical of the Manx legal and policing systems, as they currently stand.

<doc id="562132" wikidata="Q1376775" url="?curid=562132" title="Sidney Souers">
<text>Sidney William Souers (March 30, 1892 – January 14, 1973) was an American military intelligence officer who was the first person to hold the office of Director of Central Intelligence, being head of the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), the direct predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and of the National Intelligence Authority (NIA), the direct predecessor to the National Security Council (NSC).

From 1947 to 1949, Souers also served as Executive Secretary of the U.S. National Security Council, and was a close and trusted advisor of president Harry S. Truman.

== Early life and education ==
Sidney Souers was born in Dayton, Ohio. He attended Purdue University and eventually Miami University, graduating from the latter in 1914 with a Bachelor of Arts. During his time at Miami, Souers was a member of the Kappa chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon.

After completing his education, Souers was initially attracted to a business career. He was a founder and first president of the First Joint Stock Land Bank of Dayton, and also served as a high ranking business executive in New Orleans and later St. Louis for a number of notable companies, including Piggly Wiggly stores and Metropolitan Life Insurance. He was among the co-founders of American Airlines.

== Career ==

=== Navy career ===
Souers was called to active duty with the United States Navy on July 22, 1940, after serving eleven years in the naval reserves as an intelligence officer. Initially commissioned as a lieutenant commander, Souers was promoted to full commander in February 1942 when he was assigned to command the Sixth Naval District, headquartered at Naval Station Great Lakes in Chicago. In May 1943, after a German U-boat was sunk by the U.S. Coast Guard off the South Carolina coast, Souers, along with Royal Navy commander Patrick W. Stone, was tasked with the interrogation of the submarine&#x27;s crew. 

Souers was appointed assistant director of the Office of Naval Intelligence on July 24, 1944. He was promoted to rear admiral and deputy chief of Naval Intelligence on November 8, 1945. He was eventually relieved of active duty on July 22, 1946, after exactly six years of naval service.

=== Director of Central Intelligence ===
Sidney Souers was appointed member of a joint committee of State, War and Navy department employees in December 1944, chaired by Ferdinand Eberstadt and tasked with creating what would become known as the Eberstadt Report. In the report, Souers argued for the creation of a new central intelligence organization after the war that was to be under civilian as opposed to military control. By late 1945, Souers&#x27; proposal had come to the attention of president Harry S. Truman, who personally ordered Souers to send a memo to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal on the president&#x27;s approval of the proposition.
On January 22, 1946, the National Intelligence Authority was officially established, with president Truman appointing Souers as director of its Central Intelligence Group (CIG). Souers agreed to serve as interim director until a permanent director could be appointed. Souers was initially tasked with giving daily intelligence briefings to president Truman on current developments in intelligence and national security. Despite being the inaugural holder of the office of Director of Central Intelligence, Souers was insistent on returning to his civilian business career, and was reluctantly relieved of his duties by president Truman on June 7, 1946 following the nomination of Hoyt Vandenberg as CIG director.

=== Later career ===
Souers was soon called back to Washington when president Truman appointed him to serve as Executive Secretary of the National Security Council following its creation on July 26, 1947. In this capacity as a non-voting member, he met with the president daily as a personal informant on national security issues and planning. He was the first to brief Truman on the possible existence of a thermonuclear weapon, and remained a key figure in its development, being a major proponent of the establishment of an intelligence division within the Atomic Energy Commission. In March 1949, following the retirement of Truman&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, Souers was selected to fill Leahy&#x27;s duties of advising the president on national defense. Souers resigned from his position as Executive Secretary on December 21, 1949, though remained Truman&#x27;s chief consultant on national security until the end of his presidency in 1953.

Souers was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by president Truman on December 2, 1952, for &quot;keen foresight and tireless efforts toward fulfillment of a strong and effective security program&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==
Souers died at his home in St. Louis on January 15, 1973, aged 80. Following his death, Miami University created the Admiral Sidney Souers Distinguished Alumni Award in 1977 at the bequest of his widow, Sylvia Nettle.

<doc id="562136" wikidata="Q186347" url="?curid=562136" title="Caravanserai">
<text>A caravanserai (or caravansary; ) was an inn that provided lodging for travelers, merchants, and caravans. Depending on the region and period, they were called by a variety of names including &quot;khan&quot;, &quot;funduq&quot; and &quot;wikala.&quot; Caravanserais supported the flow of commerce, information, and people across the network of trade routes covering Asia, North Africa and Southeast Europe, most notably the Silk Road. In the countryside, they were typically built at intervals equivalent to a day&#x27;s journey along important roads, where they served as a kind of staging post. Urban versions of caravanserais were historically common in cities throughout the Islamic world, where they could serve as inns, depots, and venues for conducting business. 

The buildings were most commonly rectangular structures with one protected entrance. Inside, a central courtyard was surrounded by an array of rooms on one or more levels.&quot;&quot; In addition to lodgings for people, they often included space to accommodate horses, camels, and other pack animals, as well as storage rooms for merchandise.

==Terms and etymology==
===Caravanserai===
Caravanserai (), is the Persian compound word variant combining &quot;kārvān&quot; &quot;caravan&quot; with &quot;-sarāy&quot; &quot;palace&quot;, &quot;building with enclosed courts&quot;. Here &quot;caravan&quot; means a group of traders, pilgrims, and travelers, engaged in long-distance travel. The word is also rendered as &quot;caravansary&quot;, &quot;caravansaray&quot;, &quot;caravanseray&quot;, &quot;caravansara&quot;, and &quot;caravansarai&quot;. In scholarly sources, it is often used as an umbrella term for multiple related types of commercial buildings similar to inns or hostels, whereas the actual instances of such buildings had a variety of names depending on the region and the local language. However, the term was typically preferred for rural inns built along roads outside of city walls.

===Khan===

The word &quot;khan&quot; () derives from a clipping of . It could refer to an urban caravanserai built within a town or a city or to any caravanserai in general, including those built in the countryside and along desert routes. It came into more common usage under the Mamluk Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire.

From Persian, the word passed into common usage in Arabic () and Turkish (). Examples of such buildings are found throughout the Middle East from as early as the Umayyad Caliphate. The same word was used in Bosnian, Albanian, Romanian and Bulgarian, having arrived through the Ottoman conquest.

===Funduq===

The term &quot;funduq&quot; (; sometimes spelled &quot;foundouk&quot; or &quot;fondouk&quot; from the French transliteration) is frequently used for historic inns around the Maghreb, particularly those in the cities.

The word comes from ; it appears as , &quot;fundaco&quot; in Venice, &quot;fondaco&quot; in Genoa and &quot;alhóndiga&quot; or &quot;fonda&quot; in Spanish. In the cities of this region such buildings were also frequently used as housing for artisan workshops.

===Wikala===

The Arabic word &quot;wikala&quot; (), sometimes spelled &quot;wakala&quot; or &quot;wekala&quot;, is a term used in Egypt for an urban caravanserai which housed merchants and their goods and served as a center for trade, storage, transactions and other commercial activity. The word &quot;wikala&quot; means roughly &quot;agency&quot; in Arabic, in this case a commercial agency, which may also have been a reference to the customs offices that could be located here to deal with imported goods. The term &quot;khan&quot; was also frequently used for this type of building in Egypt.

==== Okelle ====
The term &quot;okelle&quot; or &quot;okalle&quot;, the Italianized rendering of the Arabic word &quot;wikala&quot;, is used for a type of large urban buildings in 19th century Egypt, specifically in Alexandria. Here, the older Egyptian &quot;wikala&quot; was reinterpreted in an Italianate style by the Italian architect Francesco Mancini. Directed by Muhammad Ali, he designed and built a number of &quot;okelle&quot;s delineating the &quot;Place des Consuls&quot; (the main square of Alexandria&#x27;s European quarter), which served as consular mansions, a European-style hotel, and a stock exchange, among other functions.

===Katra===
Kāṭrā () is the name given to the caravanserais built by the Mughal Empire in Bengal. The Bara Katra () and Chhota Katra () refers to two magnificent Mughal katras in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

==History==
The origin of rural caravanserais are ancient. One early antecedent has been found in the remains of an Urartian site from the 8th or 9th century BCE uncovered in western Iran, near the mountain pass between Urmia and Oshnavieh. The Achaemenid Empire (6th to 4th centuries BCE) built staging posts or relay stations for communications along its major roads. Herodotus reports that they existed along the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s Royal Road, a ancient highway that stretched from Sardis to Susa. He writes: &quot;Now the true account of the road in question is the following: Royal stations exist along its whole length, and excellent caravanserais; and throughout, it traverses an inhabited tract, and is free from danger.&quot; The later Byzantine Empire also maintained staging posts along its major roads. None of these ancient caravanserais have been preserved and therefore not much is known of their appearance.

In the Islamic period (seventh century and after), the use of caravanserais intensified. Their development at this time is linked to the shift from wheeled vehicles to camels and caravans for long-distance travel. Caravanserais were a common type of structure both in the rural countryside and in dense urban centers across the Middle East, North Africa, and Ottoman Europe. The oldest identified example of an Islamic caravanserai is a courtyard structure at Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi, an Umayyad complex from the early 8th century located in the middle of the desert in present-day Syria.

A number of 12th to 13th-century rural caravanserais were built throughout the Seljuk Empire and its offshoots, many examples of which have survived across Iran (e.g. the Ribat-i Sharaf in Khorasan province), Central Asia (e.g. Ribat-i Malik in Uzbekistan) and Turkey (e.g. the large Sultan Han in Aksaray Province). They continued to be built under successor dynasties, although few notable examples have survived from the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods in the Middle East. Under the later Safavids in Iran, as the economy of the region improved, their construction increased to encourage international trade, particularly on the trade routes to India. Shah Abbas I (), in particular, built them as part of his improvements to communications and commercial infrastructure.

Urban versions of caravanserais also became important centers of economic activity in cities across the Muslim world, often concentrated near the main bazaar areas, with many examples still standing in the historic areas of Damascus, Aleppo, Cairo, Istanbul, Fes, etc. The oldest urban caravanserai to have survived to the present day is the Khan al-Mirjan in Baghdad, which dates from 1359. The commercial prosperity of the Levant during the late Middle Ages led to the proliferation of numerous caravanserais in the heart of major Syrian cities and of Cairo in Egypt. Other caravanserais were also built in the center of major cities in Safavid Iran and in the Ottoman Empire.

In the Indian subcontinent, caravanserais are found along the historic trade route known as the Grand Trunk Road. The oldest clear mention of a caravanserai in historical documents is the one commissioned by Muhammad ibn Tughluq, the Sultan of Delhi (), which was built between Delhi and Daulatabad. They grew in number during the rule of Sher Shah Suri (). Under the Mughals, the sultans commissioned the construction of further caravanserais and encouraged their entourage to do the same, mainly from the 16th to late 18th centuries. Their concept and designs were adapted from Iranian examples.

== Function ==

Caravanserais served a variety of functions supporting trade and commerce. Rural caravanserais were built at intervals along major roads. They served as way stations where merchants and travelers could safely stop and rest along the way. The distance between them was intended to be equivalent to a day&#x27;s journey. In Iran, this typically amounted to a distance of in open landscapes (like deserts and plains) or about or less in more difficult mountainous terrain. 

Urban versions of caravanserais were commonly built in the hearts of major cities. They provided lodging for merchants, in particular for foreign merchants who needed a place to stay when doing business in the city. They also served as depots for their merchandise and as venues for conducting transactions. In addition to accommodation and storage, caravanserais could include other amenities such as a hammam (bathhouse) and a prayer room or mosque.

Ibn Battuta, a 14th-century Muslim traveler, described the function of a caravanserai in the region of China:

In many parts of the Muslim world, caravanserais also provided revenues that were used to fund charitable or religious functions or buildings. This was characteristic of urban caravanserais. These revenues and functions were managed through a &quot;waqf&quot;, a protected agreement which gave certain buildings and revenues the status of mortmain endowments guaranteed under Islamic law. Many major religious complexes in the Ottoman and Mamluk empires, for example, either included a caravanserai building (like in the &quot;külliye&quot; of the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul) or drew revenues from one in the area (such as the Wikala al-Ghuri in Cairo, which was built to contribute revenues for the nearby complex of Sultan al-Ghuri).

==Architecture==

=== General ===
Typically, a caravanserai was a building with a square or rectangular floor plan, with a single entrance wide enough to permit large or heavily laden beasts such as camels to enter. It had a central courtyard, almost always open to the sky, which was surrounded by a number of identical animal stalls, bays, and chambers to accommodate merchants and their servants, animals, and merchandise.

Caravanserais provided water for human and animal consumption as well as for washing and ritual purification (&quot;wudu&quot; and &quot;ghusl&quot;), provided by a fountain or well in the courtyard and sometimes by attached public baths (hammams). They kept fodder for animals and had shops for travellers where they could acquire new supplies. Some shops bought goods from the travelling merchants. Many caravanserais were equipped with small mosques, such as the elevated prayer rooms in the center of Seljuk and Ottoman caravanserais in Turkey.

=== Variations ===
Building techniques and decoration varied depending on the region and period. Rural caravanserais of the Seljuk period in Iran and Central Asia, such as the Ribat-i Sharaf and Ribat-i Malik, were built in brick and are known for their monumental exterior façades with decorative brickwork. The rural caravanserais of Seljuk Anatolia could include, in addition to (or sometimes instead of) a courtyard, a roofed section consisting of a vaulted hall with side chambers. Built of stone rather than brick, Anatolian caravanserais are also notable for their tall and elaborately-carved entrance portals. 

The urban caravanserais of the Levant, from the late Middle Ages onward, were of typical layout but built with local decoration such as &quot;ablaq&quot; masonry and carved stone details. Their street façades often had alcoves for hosting shops. Some were quite large and formed part of a larger complex of amenities, as in the Khan al-Jumruk in Aleppo. In Cairo, starting in the Burji Mamluk period, &quot;wikala&quot;s were frequently several stories tall and often included a &quot;rab&quot;&#x27;, a low-income rental apartment complex, that was situated on the upper floors while the merchant accommodations occupied the lower floors. This made the best use of limited space in a crowded city and provided the building with two sources of revenue that were managed through the &quot;waqf&quot; system.

The later Ottomans continued to build caravanserais but their patronage was focused on urban centres, where they were built alongside other commercial structures such as &quot;arasta&quot;s (market streets) and &quot;bedesten&quot;s (central market halls) in the middle of the city. The caravanserais themselves consist of courtyards surrounded by two or more levels of domed rooms fronted by arcaded galleries.

In Safavid Iran, caravanserais had a standard layout for the most part: a rectangular courtyard surrounded by a gallery of vaulted openings (iwans) and rooms on one or two levels. At the middle of each of side was a larger central iwan, repeating the four-iwan plan common in Iranian architecture. Rural caravanserais often had rounded towers at their corners and an imposing entrance portal. In the later Safavid period (17th century), more complex layouts appeared, such as those with an octagonal floor plan instead of rectangular. In the Indian subcontinent, caravanserais were drawn from Iranian designs but adapted to local needs. They usually had a symmetrical floor plan with two major gateways. A mosque, often consisting of a three-domed hall, was commonly built into the west side of the building.

In the far west of the Islamic world, comprising present-day Morocco and Spain, urban caravanserais were multi-story buildings with a central courtyard. Though they could have elaborate entrance portals and ornate wooden ceilings in their vestibules, the interior could be relatively austere.

<text>Gordon was one of five local government districts in the Grampian region of Scotland. The council was based in Inverurie. It was created in 1975 and abolished in 1996, when the area was included in the Aberdeenshire council area.

==History==
The district was created on 16 May 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Gordon was one of five districts created within the Grampian region. The new district covered the whole area of eight former districts and parts of another two, which were all abolished at the same time:

*Aberdeen district (parishes of Belhelvie, Echt, Fintray, Kinellar, New Machar, and Skene only)
*Alford district
*Ellon burgh
*Ellon district (except parish of Cruden)
*Garioch district
*Huntly burgh
*Huntly district
*Inverurie burgh
*Kintore burgh
*Oldmeldrum burgh
The whole area was part of the county of Aberdeenshire prior to the reforms.

Various names were considered for the new district, with alternatives including Bennachie from a range of hills in the area, Mar after one of the historic provinces of Scotland, and Donside from the River Don which flows through the area. At a meeting in March 1972 the old Aberdeenshire County Council voted in favour of recommending to the government that Gordon should be the new district&#x27;s name, after the Clan Gordon which had extensive landholdings in the area, including the clan&#x27;s then principal seat of Haddo House. The clan took its name from the village of Gordon in Berwickshire.

The regions and districts created in 1975 were abolished in 1996, being replaced by council areas. The area of Gordon was merged with the Banff and Buchan and Kincardine and Deeside districts to become the new Aberdeenshire council area.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 until its abolition in 1996 was as follows:
==Premises==

The council initially met at Inverurie Town Hall and had its main offices in a converted former bank at 3 High Street in Inverurie, with additional offices in various other locations. Shortly after the council&#x27;s creation it decided to consolidate its meeting place and offices at a purpose-built headquarters. Gordon House was subsequently built on Blackhall Road in Inverurie in phases between 1980 and 1982. It also housed some departments of Grampian Regional Council. Gordon House was formally opened on 9 July 1982.

After the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996, Gordon House became an area office for the successor Aberdeenshire Council.

==Coat of arms==
The Gordon District Council was granted a coat of arms by Lord Lyon King of Arms on 9 June 1986. The first quarter of the shield showed three gold boars&#x27; heads on a blue ground, the arms of the Gordon family, from whom the district&#x27;s name was derived. The Gordon arms had formed one quarter of the arms of Aberdeenshire County Council. Boars&#x27; heads also formed part of the arms of the burgh of Huntly. The second quarter was derived from the Kintore burgh arms, showing an oak tree. The third quarter was based on the arms of the burgh of Oldmeldrum and the fourth on those of the burgh of Ellon. In the centre of the shield was a gold tower, from Inverurie&#x27;s burgh arms. Above the arms was a coronet consisting of a gold circlet topped by thistle-heads: a design reserved by Lord Lyon for the arms of district councils.

<text>The Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level.

The GLIAC was founded in June 1972. Its eleven member institutions are located in the Midwestern United States in the states of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. There are three affiliate members who compete in the GLIAC for sports not sponsored by their home conference.

Sponsorship of football was dropped by the GLIAC after the 1989 season. Conference schools sponsoring football joined with members of the Heartland Football Conference to form the Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference (MIFC), which began play in 1990. The MIFC merged with the GLIAC in July 1999, and the GLIAC resumed sponsorship of football that fall.

<doc id="562147" wikidata="Q6410454" url="?curid=562147" title="Kincardine and Deeside">
<text>Kincardine and Deeside was one of five local government districts in the Grampian region of Scotland. Its council was based in Stonehaven. It was created in 1975 and abolished in 1996, when the area was included in the Aberdeenshire council area.

==History==
This region is rich in prehistory with numerous megalithic sites, notable in the earliest period of recorded history with several significant Roman sites. The region is also traversed by several ancient trackways across the Grampian Mountains, including the Causey Mounth and Elsick Mounth. In addition there is evidence of ancient burials from the Beaker Period.

The district was created on 16 May 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Kincardine and Deeside was one of five districts created within the Grampian region. The district covered most of the historic county of Kincardineshire and part of the neighbouring county of Aberdeenshire. The new district covered the whole area of ten former districts and parts of another two, which were all abolished at the same time:

&quot;From Aberdeenshire&quot;
*Aberdeen district (Drumoak parish only)
*Ballater burgh
*Deeside district

&quot;From Kincardineshire&quot;
*Banchory burgh
*Inverbervie burgh
*Laurencekirk burgh
*Laurencekirk district
*Lower Deeside district (except the parish of Nigg, which went to the City of Aberdeen)
*St Cyrus district
*Stonehaven burgh
*Stonehaven district
*Upper Deeside district

The regions and districts created in 1975 were abolished in 1996, being replaced by council areas. The area of Kincardine and Deeside was merged with the Banff and Buchan and Gordon districts to become the new Aberdeenshire council area.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 until its abolition in 1996 was as follows:
==Premises==
The council was based at Viewmount on Arduthie Road in Stonehaven. The building had been the headquarters of Kincardineshire County Council since 1935. It had been built in 1881 as a house, and by the 1920s had been converted to offices. Following a fire in 1932 it was largely rebuilt and extended in order to become the county council&#x27;s main offices and meeting place, being formally opened as such on 8 May 1935.

After the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996, Viewmount became an area office for the successor Aberdeenshire Council.

<doc id="562151" wikidata="Q2813525" url="?curid=562151" title="1 West India Quay">
<text>1 West India Quay is a landmark 33-storey mixed-use skyscraper situated just north of Canary Wharf business district in east London. Completed in 2004, the development was built by Manhattan Loft Corporation and the now-defunct MWB Group Holdings. The distinctive glass- and aluminium-clad tower was designed by HOK. With its knife-edge profile and elegant curves, 1 West India Quay was one of the first post-tensioned, concrete-framed towers in London.

The building is 111 metres (364 feet) tall and has 33 floors (not including roof). The bottom 12 floors house a Marriott Hotel, including 47 serviced suites on floors 9–12. Floors 13-33 house 158 apartments. The tower overlooks West India Docks and the Canary Wharf estate.

==History==
In 2001, planning permission was gained by Squire and Partners for a slender landmark mixed-use tower conceived to act as a visual counterpoint to the monumental brick form of the adjacent Victorian warehouses in London&#x27;s Docklands. Designed by HOK, the building&#x27;s elliptical form is reminiscent of the curved hull of a boat. The plans were part of the redevelopment of the area.

The concrete core reached full height on 11 April 2003. The official topping-out of the structure occurred on 24 September 2003, at which point 1 West India Quay became London&#x27;s 21st tallest building.

While works had been expected to finish in May 2004, the skyscraper was not handed over until December. A report in &quot;The Times&quot; said that MWB Group Holdings and its partner Manhattan Loft Corporation had &quot;fallen out&quot; with contractor Multiplex over the delays. Multiplex had been &quot;demanding more than £100m in extra payment from MWB, claiming delays were caused by the changes MWB sought&quot;, with MWB refusing to pay. The dispute was escalated to an independent arbitrator for adjudication.

According to contractor Multiplex, the post-tensioned 111 metre skyscraper actually &quot;formed the tallest residential block in the UK at the time of construction&quot;. Developer Harry Handelsman, of Manhattan Loft Corporation, has also claimed that upon completion 1 West India Quay was &quot;the largest high-rise building in London&quot;.

==On-screen appearances==
In the film &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot;, the character Whit owns an apartment in 1 West India Quay. Early on in the film, he is heard saying &quot;West India Quay please!&quot; to a taxi driver. Whit proposes to Libby, played by Thandie Newton, on the staircase of one of the penthouses with triple aspect floor-to-ceiling windows.

Whilst still a construction site, the building was used as a location in the film &quot;Layer Cake&quot; starring Daniel Craig.
Robert Carlyle&#x27;s character in &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; escapes zombie apocalypse with his family by seeking refuge in the building.

Much of the music video &quot;Heartbroken&quot; by T2 (a London-based, garage music band) was filmed in or around 1 West India Quay.

The introduction of the show &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Invisible Worlds&quot; was filmed on the rooftop of 1 West India Quay, with Richard Hammond standing close to the building&#x27;s signature arched top.

<text>The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (Abrv: MDES; , ), formerly known as the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT), , is a cabinet ministry of Thailand. MICT was established on 3 October 2002 by the Administrative Reorganisation Act, 2002. The new ministry was created as the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society by the Re-organization of Ministry, Bureau and Department Act, B.E. 2558.

==History==
In September 2016, Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT) was dissolved and replaced by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society. The ministry assumed the responsibilities of MICT. MICT&#x27;s former agencies, the National Statistical Office of Thailand, the Thai Meteorological Department, the Electronic Transactions Development Agency, Thailand Post, TOT, and CAT Telecom, are to be transferred to the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society.

<text>The Government Ministries of Thailand (: &quot;Krasuang&quot;) are the government agencies that compose the executive branch of the Government of Thailand. Each ministry is headed by a minister of state (, ) and, depending on the prime minister, several deputy ministers ( . The combined heads of these agencies form the Cabinet of Thailand. There are 19 ministries. The combined employees of these departments make up the civil service of Thailand.

==Ministries==
==History==
During the Rattanakosin Period, the kingdom&#x27;s administration was similar to that of the Ayutthaya Period. There were two chief ministers (: the first running military affairs or &quot;samuhakalahom&quot; (, and the second &quot;Samuhanayok&quot; ( for civilian affairs. The civilian ministry was divided further into four &quot;kroms&quot; (, headed by a &quot;senabodi&quot; ( or &#x27;minister&#x27;. This type of administration was called the &quot;Chatusadom&quot; ( :

===Rama V reforms===
King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), who had received a European education and traveled widely, reformed the administration of the state. In 1875, he issued a royal decree to bring about this reform, dividing and creating many departments, and thereby preventing the archaic system from collapsing.

The administrative reforms of Chulalongkorn created six ministries (, each headed by a minister of state or (, ):

A further four were soon added:

By 1900 the entire structure was formed. The ten ministries became the center of Siamese government and rule. After the 1932 Revolution, most of the ministries were retained by the Khana Ratsadon, however from then on the ministers were chosen by the prime minister and not the king.

<text>Following the termination of hostilities in World War II, the Allies were in control of the defeated Axis countries. Anticipating the defeat of Germany, Italy and Japan, they had already set up the European Advisory Commission and a proposed Far Eastern Advisory Commission to make recommendations for the post-war period. Accordingly, they managed their control of the defeated countries through Allied Commissions, often referred to as Allied Control Commissions (ACC), consisting of representatives of the major Allies.

==Italy==
Under the provisions of Article 37 in the &quot;Armistice with Italy Instrument of Surrender&quot;, September 29, 1943, the Control Commission for Italy was established on November 10, 1943, and was dismantled on December 14, 1947, following the conclusion of the Italian Peace Treaty at the Paris Peace Conference in 1947.
Chief Commissioners: General Noel Mason-MacFarlane, then Harold Macmillan

==Romania==
The Armistice Agreement with Rumania, signed on September 12, 1944, established, among others, the following:
* Article 1 &quot;As from August 24, 1944, at four a.m., Rumania has entirely discontinued military operations against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on all theaters of war, has withdrawn from the war against the United Nations, has broken off relations with Germany and her satellites, has entered the war and will wage war on the side of the Allied Powers against Germany and Hungary for the purpose of restoring Rumanian independence and sovereignty, for which purpose she provides not less than twelve infantry divisions with corps troops.&quot;
* Article 4 &quot;The state frontier between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Rumania, established by the Soviet-Rumanian Agreement of June 28, 1940, is restored.&quot;
* Article 18 &quot;An Allied Control Commission will be established which will undertake until the conclusion of peace the regulation of and control over the execution of the present terms under the general direction and orders of the Allied (Soviet) High Command, acting on behalf of the Allied Powers&quot;. In the Annex to Article 18, it was made clear that &quot;The Romanian Government and their organs shall fulfill all instructions of the Allied Control Commission arising out of the Armistice Agreement.&quot; and that the Allied Control Commission would have its seat in Bucharest.
* Article 19 &quot;The Allied Governments regard the decision of the Vienna award regarding Transylvania as null and void and are agreed that Transylvania (or the greater part thereof) should be returned to Rumania, subject to confirmation at the peace settlement, and the Soviet Government agrees that Soviet forces shall take part for this purpose in joint military operations with Rumania against Germany and Hungary.&quot;

In line with Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement two Romanian People&#x27;s Tribunals were set up to try suspected war criminals. The Treaty of Peace with Romania was signed on February 10, 1947, and entered into force on September 15, 1947.

The commission, placed under the nominal leadership of Soviet general Rodion Malinovsky (represented by Vladislav Petrovich Vinogradov), was dominated by Red Army leaders.

The commission was one of the tools used by the Soviet Union to impose communist rule in Romania. Soviet occupation forces remained in Romania until 1958 and the country became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, joining the Warsaw Pact and COMECON.

==Finland==

The Allied Control Commission (ACC) arrived in Finland on September 22, 1944, to observe Finnish compliance with the Moscow Armistice. It consisted of 200 Soviet and 15 British members and was led by Col. Gen. Andrei Zhdanov. As the commission was virtually entirely controlled by the Soviets, it was even officially referred to as the Allied (Soviet) Control Commission (&quot;Liittoutuneiden (Neuvostoliiton) valvontakomissio&quot; in Finnish). Immediately after its inception, the commission required Finland to take more vigorous action to intern the German forces in Northern Finland. Finland&#x27;s compliance with the commission resulted in a campaign to force out the remaining German troops in the area. Simultaneously, the commission also required Finland to demobilize.

The ACC provided Finland with a list of political leaders against whom Finland had to start judicial proceedings. This required Finnish &quot;ex post facto&quot; legislation. The ACC interfered with the war-responsibility trials by requiring longer prison sentences than the preliminary verdict would have contained. The ACC and the Moscow Armistice also required bans on a number of fascist, far-right and anti-Soviet organizations, among them the Civil Guard and Lotta Svärd organizations. Furthermore, the ACC required the forced return of all Soviet citizens, including Ingrian Finns and Estonians, to the Soviet Union.

After the war, the Finnish military placed part of the weapons of the demobilized troops into several hundred caches distributed around the country. The caches would have been used to arm guerillas in case of a Soviet occupation. When the matter was leaked to the public, the commission required Finnish authorities to investigate and prosecute the officers and men responsible for the caching. The Weapons Cache Case was followed closely until the ACC determined that the case was purely a military operation. The Allied Control Commission left Finland September 26, 1947, when the Soviet Union finally ratified the Paris Peace Treaty.

==Bulgaria==
The Armistice Agreement with Bulgaria was signed on October 28, 1944, and its provisions were:
* Article 1: &quot;On the conclusion of hostilities against Germany the Bulgarian armed forces must be demobilized and put on a peace footing under: supervision of the Allied Control Commission.&quot;
* Article 11: property taken from United Nations territory must be returned to those territories under the supervision of the Control Commission.
* Article 13: property belonging to the Axis powers of Germany and Hungary must not be returned without permission of the Control Commission.
* Article 18: the commission would &quot;regulate and supervise the execution of the armistice terms under the chairmanship of the representative of the Allied (Soviet) High Command. ... During the period between the coming into force of the armistice and the conclusion of hostilities against Germany, the Allied Control Commission will be under the general direction of the Allied (Soviet) High Command.&quot;

The United States representatives on the Commission for Bulgaria were Major General John A. Crane (October 28, 1944 – March 1, 1946) and Major General Walter M. Robertson (March 1, 1946 – September 10, 1947).

==Hungary==
The Armistice Agreement with Hungary was concluded on January 20, 1945, and its provisions were:
** Article 1: &quot;&quot;On the conclusion of hostilities against Germany, the Hungarian armed forces must be demobilized and put on a peace footing under the supervision of the Allied Control Commission.&quot;
** Article 2: &quot;Hungary has accepted the obligation to evacuate all Hungarian troops and officials from the territory of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Rumania occupied by her within the limits of the frontiers of Hungary existing on December 31, 1937, and also to repeal all legislative and administrative provisions relating to the annexation or incorporation into Hungary of Czechoslovak, Yugoslav and Rumanian territory.&quot;
** Article 6: property taken from United Nations territory must be returned to those territories under the supervision of the Control Commission.
** Article 8: property belonging to the Axis power of Germany must not be returned without permission of the Control Commission.
** Article 11: Hungary should pay for the Allied Control Commission and that &quot;&quot;The Government of Hungary will also assure, in case of need, the use and regulation of the work of industrial and transport enterprises, means of communication, power stations, enterprises and installations of public utility, stores of fuel and other material, in accordance with instructions issued during the armistice by the Allied (Soviet) High Command or the Allied Control Commission.&quot;
** Article 17: &quot;Hungarian administrative bodies undertaking to carry out, in the interests of the reestablishment of peace and security, instructions and orders of the Allied (Soviet) High Command or Allied Control Commission issued by them for the purpose of securing the execution of these armistice terms.&quot;
** Article 18: &quot;For the whole period of the armistice there will be established in Hungary an Allied Control Commission which will regulate and supervise the execution of the armistice terms under the chairmanship of the representative of the Allied ( Soviet ) High Command ... During the period between the coming into force of the armistice and the conclusion of hostilities against Germany, the Allied Control Commission will be under the general direction of the Allied (Soviet) High Command.&quot;&quot;
* Allied Control Commission in Hungary; January 20, 1945

The United States representatives on the Commission for Hungary were Major General William S. Key (January 20, 1945 – July 4, 1946) and Brigadier General George H. Weems (July 5, 1946 – September 15, 1947).

==Germany==
The Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany oversaw the Allied Occupation Zones in Germany. The ACC was established by agreement of June 5, 1945, supplemented by agreement of September 20 of that same year, with its seat in Berlin. Its members were Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States of America. Decisions could only be made by consensus. From the outset; proceedings were heavily compromised through systematic non-cooperation from the French representatives. The French had been excluded (at American insistence) from the Potsdam Conference and consequently refused to recognise any obligation for the ACC to be constrained by the Potsdam agreement. In particular, they resisted all proposals to establish common policies and institutions across Germany as a whole, and anything that they feared might lead to the emergence of an eventual unified German government. Cooperation within the ACC finally broke down completely when the Soviet representative withdrew on March 20, 1948. Until 1971, the ACC did not meet again, and the stage was set for the partition of Germany into two states.

After the breakdown of the ACC, the British, French and United States of America occupation zones and the British, French and United States of America sectors in Berlin were governed by the Allied High Commission with membership from Britain, France, and the United States, whilst the Soviet Zone and Soviet sector of Berlin were governed by the Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission, later the Soviet High Commissioner. The role of the High Commissioners ceased when the three western zones (other than Berlin) and the Soviet Zone (other than in Berlin) acquired &quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty as respectively the Federal Republic of Germany (&#x27;West Germany&#x27;) and the German Democratic Republic (&#x27;East Germany&#x27;) (subject to certain restrictions).

The ACC convened again in 1971, leading to agreement on transit arrangements in Berlin. During the talks for unification of Germany in late 1989, it was decided to convene the ACC again as a forum for solving the issue of Allied rights and privileges in Germany. The disbanding of the ACC was officially announced by the Two Plus Four Agreement of September 12, 1990, effective as of March 15, 1991. The ACC last met on 2 October 1990, on the eve of German Reunification.

==Austria==

The creation of an Allied Commission for Austria was envisaged by Allied leaders at the various sessions of the European Advisory Commission in 1944. The matter became more pressing following the Soviet takeover of Vienna from German control on April 13, 1945. The Soviet authorities in Vienna decided to establish a new Austrian government without prior consultation with the other Allied leaders, and on April 27, the Austrian socialist leader Karl Renner formed a government in Vienna. The British, US and French governments refused at first to recognize the Renner government, and in order to undermine the Soviet move decided to start right away with the proceedings to establish a joint commission for Austria. However, the Soviet government withheld permission for Allied representatives to enter Vienna during late April to early May, arguing that agreement on partition of Vienna into four occupation zones must be done prior to the arrival of any other troops thereto. As a result, it was only on June 4 that a delegation of US, British and French generals was able to arrive at Vienna to survey conditions in the area. However, not much progress was made throughout June, as the Soviet authorities restricted the movement of the western Allies in and around Vienna. Throughout June, negotiations for agreement on division of Austria into occupation zones were held in London within the European Advisory Commission, and the agreement was concluded on July 4, 1945, subject to further approval. The agreement was then approved by the four Allied governments. On July 12, it was approved by the British and French governments. On July 21, the Soviet government gave its approval, and the US government followed suit on July 24.
On June 27, 1945, shortly prior to the formation of the Allied Commission for Austria, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an ordinance authorizing General Mark W. Clark as Commander in Chief of US Forces of Occupation in Austria. Regarding the future commission for Austria, the directive stated:

The Allied Commission for Austria was established by the &quot;Agreement on Control Machinery in Austria&quot;, signed in the European Advisory Commission in London on July 4, 1945. It entered into force on July 24, 1945, on the day that the United States gave notification of approval, the last of the four powers to do so. It was supplemented by an agreement of June 28, 1946, which enabled the Austrian government to conduct foreign relations.

A separate agreement for the division of the city of Vienna into four occupation zones was concluded on July 9, 1945. This agreement was approved by the British government on July 12, the French government on July 16, the Soviet government on July 21 and the US government on July 24.

Austria was divided into four zones: American, British, French and Soviet. Vienna, being the capital, was similarly divided but at its centre was an International Zone, sovereignty of which alternated at regular intervals between the four powers. The commission had its seat in Vienna.

A problem faced by the commission was the issue of the provisional government under Karl Renner, which was established unilaterally by the Soviet government in early May 1945. The other Allied governments refused at first to recognize it, but on October 1, 1945, the commission made the following recommendation:

The commission recommended the recognition of Renner&#x27;s government in exchange for the introduction of freedom of the press and the holding of free elections.

The commission for Austria was dismantled following the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty on May 15, 1955.

==Japan==
It was agreed at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, and made public in communique issued at the end of the conference on December 27, 1945, that the Far Eastern Advisory Commission (FEAC) would become the Far Eastern Commission (FEC), it would be based in Washington, and would oversee the Allied Council for Japan. This arrangement was similar to those that the Allies had set up for overseeing the defeated Axis powers in Europe. In a mirror image of those Axis countries, like Hungary, which fell to the Soviet Union and were occupied by the Red Army alone, Japan having fallen to the United States and occupied by the U.S. Army, the United States was given the dominant position on the Tokyo-based Allied Council for Japan. The change in name of the FEAC to FEC was significant because as the U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes reported after the Conference &quot;As early as August 9 we invited the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and China to join with us in carrying out the objectives of the Potsdam Declaration and the Terms of Surrender for Japan. The Far Eastern Advisory Commission was established in October, but Great Britain had reservations regarding its advisory character, and the Soviet Union requested a decision regarding control machinery in Tokyo before joining the work of the commission.&quot;. As agreed in the communique the FEC and the Allied Council were dismantled following the Treaty of San Francisco on September 8, 1951.

<doc id="562163" wikidata="Q447638" url="?curid=562163" title="John Stott">
<text>John Robert Walmsley Stott (27 April 1921 – 27 July 2011) was a British Anglican priest and theologian who was noted as a leader of the worldwide evangelical movement. He was one of the principal authors of the Lausanne Covenant in 1974. In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked Stott among the 100 most influential people in the world.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
John Robert Walmsley Stott was born on 27 April 1921 in London, England, to Sir Arnold and Emily &quot;Lily&quot; Stott (née Holland). His father was a leading physician at Harley Street and an agnostic, while his mother had been raised Lutheran and attended the nearby Church of England church, All Souls, Langham Place. Stott was sent to boarding schools at eight years old, initially to a prep school, Oakley Hall. In 1935, he went on to Rugby School. While at Rugby School in 1938, Stott heard Eric Nash (nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot;), director of the Iwerne camps, deliver a sermon entitled &quot;What Then Shall I Do with Jesus, Who Is Called the Christ?&quot; After this talk, Nash pointed Stott to Revelation 3:20, &quot;Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.&quot; Stott later described the impact this verse had upon him as follows:

Stott was mentored by Nash, who wrote a weekly letter to him, advising him on how to develop and grow in his Christian life, as well as practicalities such as leading the Christian Union at his school.

At this time, also, Stott was a pacifist and a member of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship. In later life he withdrew from pacifism, adopting a &#x27;just war&#x27; stance.

Stott studied modern languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with double first-class honours in French and theology. At university, he was active in the Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, where the executive committee considered him too invaluable a person to be asked to commit his time by joining the committee. After Trinity he transferred to Ridley Hall Theological College, affiliated to the University of Cambridge, to train for ordination as an Anglican cleric.

He later received a Lambeth Doctorate of Divinity in 1983.

===Ministry===
Stott was ordained as a deacon in 1945 and became a curate at All Souls Church, Langham Place (1945–1950), then rector (1950–1975). This was the church in which he had grown up and where he spent almost his whole life apart from a few years spent in Cambridge. In 1956, he appointed Frances Whitehead as his secretary and the pair remained as a working partnership until his death, with &quot;Auntie Frances&quot; as the right hand to &quot;Uncle John&quot;. While rector, he became increasingly influential on a national and international basis, most notably being a key player in the 1966–1967 dispute about the appropriateness of evangelicals remaining in the Church of England. He had founded the Church of England Evangelical Council (CEEC) in 1960 to bring together the different strands of evangelicals. In 1970, in response to increasing demands on his time from outside the All Souls congregation, he appointed a vicar of All Souls, to enable him to work on other projects. In 1975 Stott resigned as rector and Michael Baughen, the then vicar, was appointed in his place; Stott remained at the church and was appointed rector emeritus.

In 1969, he founded Langham Trust, and in 1982 the London Institute for Contemporary Christianity of which he remained honorary president until his death. During his presidency he gathered together leading evangelical intellectuals to shape courses and programmes communicating the Christian faith into a secular context. He was regularly accompanied by a leading paediatrician, John Wyatt, and the institute director, the broadcaster Elaine Storkey, when they spoke across the country to large audiences on &quot;Matters of Life and Death&quot;. Following his chairmanship of the second National Evangelical Anglican Congress in April 1977, the Nottingham statement was published which said, &quot;Seeing ourselves and Roman Catholics as fellow-Christians, we repent of attitudes that have seemed to deny it.&quot; This aroused controversy amongst some evangelicals at the time.

===Retirement and death===
Stott announced his retirement from public ministry in April 2007 at the age of 86. He took up residence in the College of St Barnabas, Lingfield, Surrey, a retirement community for Anglican clergy but remained as rector emeritus of All Souls Church.

Stott died on 27 July 2011 at the College of St Barnabas in Lingfield at 3:15 pm local time. He was surrounded by family and close friends and they were reading the Bible and listening to Handel&#x27;s Messiah when he peacefully died. An obituary in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; reported that his death was due to age-related complications and that he had been in discomfort for several weeks. The obituary described him as &quot;An architect of 20th-century evangelicalism [who] shaped the faith of a generation.&quot; His status was such that his death was reported in the secular media. The BBC referred to him as someone who could &quot;explain complex theology in a way lay people could easily understand&quot;. Obituaries were published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Tributes were paid to Stott by a number of leaders and other figures within the Christian community. The American evangelist Billy Graham released a statement saying, &quot;The evangelical world has lost one of its greatest spokesmen, and I have lost one of my close personal friends and advisors. I look forward to seeing him again when I go to heaven.&quot; The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, wrote:
Stott&#x27;s funeral was held on 8 August 2011 at All Souls Church. It was reported that the church was full with people queuing for a considerable time before the service started.

A memorial website remembrance book (closed 2017) attracted comments from over one thousand individuals. Memorial services for Stott were held at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London; Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland, New Zealand; St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, Australia; College Church, Wheaton, Illinois, United States; Anglican Network Church of the Good Shepherd, Vancouver, Canada; St. Paul&#x27;s, Bloor Street, Toronto, Canada; as well as in cities across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Upon his death, he was cremated, his ashes were interred at Dale Cemetery, in Pembrokeshire, Wales.

Frances Whitehead, his secretary since 1956, was the executor of his will and she ensured that all his papers were deposited in the Lambeth Palace archive the year after his death.

==Influence==
Stott has had considerable influence in evangelicalism. In a November 2004 editorial on Stott, the &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist David Brooks cited Michael Cromartie of the Ethics and Public Policy Center as saying that &quot;if evangelicals could elect a pope, Stott is the person they would likely choose&quot;.

===Writing===
He wrote over 50 books, some of which appear only in Chinese, Korean, or Spanish, as well as many articles and papers.

One of these is &quot;Basic Christianity&quot;, a book which seeks to explain the message of Christianity, and convince its readers of its truth and importance.

&quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Portrait: Some New Testament Word Studies&quot;, published in 1961, it was an important reference for clergy.

He was also the author of &quot;The Cross of Christ&quot; (), of which J. I. Packer stated, &quot;No other treatment of this supreme subject says so much so truly and so well.&quot;

Other books he wrote include &quot;Essentials: A Liberal–Evangelical Dialogue&quot;, a dialogue with the liberal cleric and theologian David L. Edwards, over whether what evangelicals hold as essential should be seen as such. In 2005, he produced &quot;Evangelical Truth&quot;, which summarises what he perceives as being the central claims of Christianity, essential for evangelicalism.

Upon his formal retirement from public engagements, he continued to engage in regular writing until his death. In 2008, he produced &quot;The Anglican Evangelical Doctrine of Infant Baptism&quot; with J. Alec Motyer.

An introduction to his thought can be found in his two final substantial publications, which act as a summation of his thinking. Both were published by the publishing house with which he had a lifelong association, IVP.
* In 2007, his reflections on the life of the church: &quot;The Living Church: Convictions of a Lifelong Pastor&quot;.
* In January 2010, at the age of 88, he saw the launch of what would be his final book: &quot;The Radical Disciple&quot;. It concludes with a poignant farewell and appeal for his legacy to be continued through the work of the Langham Partnership International.

===Anglican evangelicalism===
Stott&#x27;s churchmanship fell within the conservative evangelical wing of the Church of England. He played a key role as a leader of evangelicalism within the Church of England, and was regarded as instrumental in persuading evangelicals to play an active role in the Church of England rather than leaving for exclusively evangelical denominations. There were two major events where he played a key role in this regard.

He was chairing the National Assembly of Evangelicals in 1966, a convention organised by the Evangelical Alliance, when Martyn Lloyd-Jones made an unexpected call for evangelicals to unite as evangelicals and no longer stay within their &quot;mixed&quot; denominations. This view was motivated by a belief that true Christian fellowship requires evangelical views on central topics such as the atonement and the inspiration of Scripture. Lloyd-Jones was a key figure to many in the free churches, and evangelical Anglicans regarded Stott similarly. The two leaders publicly disagreed, as Stott, though not scheduled as a speaker that evening, used his role as chairman to refute Lloyd-Jones, saying that his opinion went against history and the Bible. The following year saw the first National Evangelical Anglican Congress, which was held at Keele University. At this conference, largely due to Stott&#x27;s influence, evangelical Anglicans committed themselves to full participation in the Church of England, rejecting the separationist approach proposed by Lloyd-Jones.

These two conferences effectively fixed the direction of a large part of the British evangelical community. Although there is an ongoing debate as to the exact nature of Lloyd-Jones&#x27;s views, they undoubtedly caused the two groupings to adopt diametrically opposed positions. These positions, and the resulting split, continue largely unchanged to this day.

===Honours===
Stott was appointed a Chaplain to Queen Elizabeth II in 1959 and, on his retirement in 1991, an Extra Chaplain. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the New Year Honours 2006. He received a Lambeth Doctorate of Divinity in 1983, as well as five honorary degrees, including doctorates from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (1971), Wycliffe College, Toronto (1993), and Brunel University (1997).

===Annihilationism===
Stott tentatively held to annihilationism, which is the view that the final state of the unsaved, known as hell, is death and destruction, rather than everlasting conscious torment. Stott said that: &quot;the ultimate annihilation of the wicked should at least be accepted as a legitimate, biblically founded alternative to their eternal conscious torment.&quot; This led to a heated debate within mainstream evangelical Christianity: some writers criticised Stott in very strong terms while others supported his views.

===Anti-Zionism===
 Stott stated his firm opposition to Zionism: &quot;Political Zionism and Christian Zionism are anathema to Christian faith ... The true Israel today is neither Jews nor Israelis, but believers in the Messiah, even if they are Gentiles ...&quot;

==Personal life==
Stott never married and had no children but remained celibate his entire life. He said, &quot;The gift of singleness is more a vocation than an empowerment, although to be sure God is faithful in supporting those he calls.&quot; He lived simply and gave his wealth away. &#x27;Pride is without doubt the greatest temptation of Christian leaders&#x27;, he said. When asked what he would change if he had his time again he replied &#x27;I would pray more&#x27;.

Stott&#x27;s favourite relaxation was birdwatching; his book &quot;The Birds Our Teachers&quot; draws on this interest.

<doc id="562167" wikidata="Q316627" url="?curid=562167" title="Jason Mewes">
<text>Jason Edward Mewes (born June 12, 1974) is an American actor, comedian, film producer, and podcaster. He is best known for playing Jay, the vocal half of the duo Jay and Silent Bob, in longtime friend Kevin Smith&#x27;s View Askewniverse franchise.

==Early life==
Mewes was born on June 12, 1974, in Highlands, New Jersey, and grew up in a working-class neighborhood. He never knew his father, and his mother was an ex-con and a drug addict. Relates Mewes: &quot;She used to check into hotels and take TVs and sell them... I guess it really ain&#x27;t funny, but it&#x27;s weird because it was so fucked up... She used to steal mail. I used to drive around with her and she&#x27;d pull up and make me reach into mailboxes. It really wasn&#x27;t pleasant.&quot; Although this exposure to drugs at first served to make him averse to them, he eventually began using them after graduating from Henry Hudson Regional High School.

His best friend was future filmmaker Kevin Smith, who described Mewes this way: &quot;[Jason]&#x27;s the kind of dude you know for five minutes and he whips his cock out. I was like, somebody should put this dude in a movie. I just wanted to see if anybody outside our group of friends finds him as funny as I do.&quot;

==Career==
While working toward a career in roofing, Mewes made his film debut in Smith&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Clerks&quot; as Jay. The film was a success, resulting in Mewes becoming closely identified with the role, which he also played in &quot;Mallrats&quot; (1995), &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (1997), &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001), and &quot;Clerks II&quot; (2006). He supplied Jay&#x27;s voice in the short-lived &quot;&quot;. He, along with Kevin Smith, performed in the films &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000) and &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; (2006); they appeared on the Canadian television series &quot;&quot;, in two episodes of a three-part story arc in which he and Smith film a new addition to Smith&#x27;s View Askew films titled &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh?&quot; at Degrassi Community School. They appear again on &quot;Degrassi&quot; (in a two-part episode), at the premiere of &quot;Jay and Silent Bob go Canadian, Eh?&quot; in Canada. Mewes, Smith, and &quot;Degrassi&quot; star Stacie Mistysyn made the cover of the January 29, 2005, issue of Canadian &quot;TV Guide&quot;.

In 1998, he starred as &quot;Gary Lamb – Ground Activist&quot; in a series of Nike commercials directed by Smith. From 2010 to 2012, Mewes was cast as &quot;Jimmy the Janitor&quot; for 26 episodes of the Canadian television series &quot;Todd and the Book of Pure Evil&quot;.

Mewes starred in the horror film &quot;Breath of Hate&quot; (2015), where he played a romantic love interest to a dysfunctional escort. Mewes co-starred in Smith&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;, in which Mewes, in a scene near the end of the film, appears fully nude.

Mewes co-hosts a weekly podcast with Smith called &quot;Jay &amp; Silent Bob Get Old&quot; in which Mewes discusses his former drug addiction issues.

Mewes is co-executive producer on Smith&#x27;s Hulu-exclusive series &quot;Spoilers with Kevin Smith&quot;.

Mewes co-produced the 2013 animated movie &quot;Jay &amp; Silent Bob&#x27;s Super Groovy Cartoon Movie&quot; with his wife Jordan Monsanto, which was based on the &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; comic book that Smith wrote as a companion piece to 2001&#x27;s &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;.

Mewes starred in episode 3 of the sixth season of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; as Eddie Brooks.

Mewes&#x27; directorial debut, &quot;Madness in the Method&quot;, in which he also starred, premiered August 2, 2019, in the U.S.

==Personal life==
Mewes married Jordan Monsanto in a civil ceremony on January 30, 2009, with a larger wedding planned later that May. Their daughter, Logan Lee, was born on April 1, 2015. Their second child, Lucien Lee, was born on February 12, 2023.

===Substance abuse===
Mewes has openly talked about his struggles with substance abuse, which began in his early 20s. He first began using heroin shortly after appearing in &quot;Mallrats&quot; and was soon addicted; he was under the influence while filming &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and &quot;Dogma&quot;. Kevin Smith entered Mewes into the first of a series of drug rehabilitation clinics in 1997 after noticing Mewes would randomly fall asleep, which he initially attributed to narcolepsy. Mewes sobered up until about a week into the &quot;Dogma&quot; shoot, when he learned he could pass his urine tests by abstaining from drugs for three days beforehand and then using drugs the rest of the week. In another attempt to get clean, Mewes moved in with his mother, who gave him OxyContin to ease the withdrawal symptoms.

In 1999, Mewes was arrested in New Jersey for heroin possession. His probation sentence included community service, drug counseling, and regular court appearances in New Jersey. In late 2001, after he failed to make a court appearance, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Smith had taken Mewes in to live with him and his wife, Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, but evicted him after catching him using drugs again. During this period, Mewes stole Smith&#x27;s ATM card, spent $1,100 of Smith&#x27;s money, and had heroin shipped to the hotel where a press junket for &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; was being held. Smith had Mewes check into various rehab facilities, including Promises in Malibu, where his visit coincided with frequent costar Ben Affleck&#x27;s stay for alcoholism. These attempts were unsuccessful for Mewes, whose problem was so severe that Smith was unable to give him a part in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;.

Mewes continued to use drugs, and has related that he decided to turn himself in and get help after waking up on Christmas morning in 2002 to find that he had started a fire after falling asleep near a lit candle while on heroin. Estranged from Smith, Mewes returned to New Jersey, and on April 1, 2003, he surrendered himself at a Freehold, New Jersey, court and pleaded guilty to probation violation charges. He was ordered to enter a six-month rehab program. In a July 2006 interview, he reported that he was sober, and harbored no urges to drink or use drugs. He relapsed in 2009 after having surgery.

To help Mewes maintain his sobriety, Smith created the &quot;Jay &amp; Silent Bob Get Old&quot; podcast as a &quot;weekly intervention&quot; to let Mewes talk through his history of substance abuse. In a May 2014 Reddit Q&amp;A thread with fans, Mewes stated that he had been sober since July 1, 2010.

<text>Badenoch and Strathspey was a local government district, created in 1975 as one of eight districts within the Highland region in Scotland. The district was abolished in 1996 when Highland was made a single-tier council area. Since then, the Highland Council has had a Badenoch and Strathspey area committee covering the area.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which abolished Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts and replaced them with a two-tier system of regions and districts. The new district covered four previous districts, two from Inverness-shire and two from Moray:

&quot;From Inverness-shire&quot;
*Badenoch district
*Kingussie burgh

&quot;From Moray&quot;
*Cromdale district
*Grantown-on-Spey burgh

Cromdale and Grantown-on-Spey had historically been part of Inverness-shire, but had been transferred to Moray (then called Elginshire) in 1870. The new district was named after Strathspey, the valley of the River Spey, and the historic province of Badenoch. Badenoch and Strathspey District Council was a district-level authority, with regional-level functions provided by the Highland Regional Council, based in Inverness.

The districts and regions created in 1975 were abolished in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 and replaced with single-tier council areas. The Highland region became one of the new council areas.

The Highland Council has a number of area committees for debating local matters. One of the committees is called the Badenoch and Strathspey Committee, comprising the councillors who represent the Badenoch and Strathspey ward, which broadly corresponds to the pre-1996 district.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the district and its council formally came into being on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats were held by independents:
==Premises==

Badenoch and Strathspey District Council met at the courthouse at 36 High Street in Kingussie, which had been built in 1865. The council had its main administrative offices in converted former railway buildings at Kingussie railway station on Ruthven Road. There was also an area office at the Town House (also known as the courthouse) on The Square in Grantown-on-Spey.

The buildings passed to the Highland Council on local government reorganisation in 1996. In 2016 Highland Council renovated and extended Kingussie Courthouse to become its main offices in the town, closing the former offices at Kingussie railway station and another council building at 100 High Street. The Highland Council&#x27;s Badenoch and Strathspey area committee meets at both Kingussie Courthouse and Grantown-on-Spey Town House.

<text>English Canada comprises that part of the population within Canada, whether of British origin or otherwise, that speaks English. 

The term &quot;English Canada&quot; is also used for any of the following:
*Describing all the provinces of Canada that have an anglophone majority. This is every province except Quebec. When used in this way, &quot;English Canada&quot; is often referred to as the &quot;ROC&quot; (rest of Canada). This type of usage excludes French-speaking areas in English-majority provinces like the East and North of New Brunswick, Northern and Eastern Ontario, Saint-Boniface and the few small pockets of French localities in Western Canada. It also excludes areas where a third language is widely spoken, such as German, Russian or First Nations languages.
*When discussing the culture, values and lifestyles of English-speaking Canadians as opposed to those of French-speaking Canadians. This usage is most often employed to compare English- and French-language literature, media, art and institutions.
*When discussing the Two Solitudes, in which English Canada (i.e. the anglophones of Canada) is one of two founding nations of Canada along with French Canada (i.e. the francophones of Canada), and in which these two societies share a country but rarely communicate with each other. The term was often used during the conscription crisis. The population whose native language is neither English nor French are often included into one of the two official languages or are classified as allophones.
*&quot;English Canadians&quot;, in some contexts, refers to Canadians who have origins in England, in contrast to French Canadians, Scottish Canadians, Irish Canadians, etc.
*All of the English speaking parts of each province of Canada (Quebec also included in this definition), not including the predominantly French speaking parts.

<doc id="562180" wikidata="Q1501356" url="?curid=562180" title="Preimplantation genetic diagnosis">
<text>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) is the genetic profiling of embryos prior to implantation (as a form of embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to prenatal diagnosis. When used to screen for a specific genetic disease, its main advantage is that it avoids selective abortion, as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to assisted reproductive technology, and requires in vitro fertilization (IVF) to obtain oocytes or embryos for evaluation. Embryos are generally obtained through blastomere or blastocyst biopsy. The latter technique has proved to be less deleterious for the embryo, therefore it is advisable to perform the biopsy around day 5 or 6 of development.

The world&#x27;s first PGD was performed by Handyside, Kontogianni and Winston at the Hammersmith Hospital in London. &quot;Female embryos were selectively transferred in five couples at risk of X-linked disease, resulting in two twin and one singleton pregnancy.&quot;

The term preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) refers to the set of techniques for testing whether embryos (obtained through IVF/ ICSI have an abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidy). PGS is also called aneuploidy screening. PGS was renamed preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy (PGD-A) by the Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis International Society (PGDIS) in 2016.

The PGD allows studying the DNA of eggs or embryos to select those that carry certain mutations for genetic diseases. It is useful when there are previous chromosomal or genetic disorders in the family and within the context of in vitro fertilization programs.

The procedures may also be called &quot;preimplantation genetic profiling&quot; to adapt to the fact that they are sometimes used on oocytes or embryos prior to implantation for other reasons than diagnosis or screening.

Procedures performed on sex cells before fertilization may instead be referred to as methods of oocyte selection or sperm selection, although the methods and aims partly overlap with PGD.

==History==
In 1968, Robert Edwards and Richard Gardner reported the successful identification of the sex of rabbit blastocysts. It was not until the 1980s that human IVF was fully developed, which coincided with the breakthrough of the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Handyside, Kontogianni and Winston&#x27;s first successful tests happened in October 1989, with the first births in 1990 though the preliminary experiments had been published some years earlier. In these first cases, PCR was used for sex determination of patients carrying X-linked diseases. A report in 2001 on worldwide use of PGD since 1990 reported that embryo or polar body biopsy had occurred in more than 3000 clinical cycles, with a 24% pregnancy rate, which was comparable with assisted reproductive practices which do not involve biopsy.

=== First clinical cases ===

Elena Kontogianni was studying for her PhD at the Hammersmith Hospital, on single-cell PCR for sexing, which she did by amplifying a repeated region of the Y chromosome. It was this approach that she used for the world&#x27;s first PGD cases.

Female embryos were selectively transferred in five couples at risk of X-linked disease, resulting in two twins and one singleton pregnancy. Because the Y chromosome region Kontogianni was amplifying contained many repeats, it was more efficient than trying to amplify a unique region. A band on the PCR gel indicated that the embryo was male and the absence of a band indicated that the embryo was female. However, amplification failure or an anucleate blastomere also resulted in absence of a band on the PCR gel. To reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, Kontogianni went on to co-amplify sequences on the X and Y (Kontogianni et al., 1991). At that time nothing was known about allele dropout, cumulus cell contamination, or amplification failure from single cells. During the 1980s, human IVF embryos were exclusively transferred on day two of development as the culture medium used was incapable of reliably growing embryos past this stage. Since the biopsy was to be performed on day three, the first diagnoses were all performed in one day, with transfer of the embryos late on day three. A comparison of day two and day three transfers indicated that this would not adversely affect pregnancy rates. The worry of embryos arresting was so high that some transfers took place in the early hours of day four so that the embryos were removed from culture as soon as possible. There were many evenings at the Hammersmith when a transfer was performed at 1 a.m. on day four and researchers returned to the laboratory at 7 a.m. to start the next case. Winston helped deliver most of the first PGD babies.

PGD became increasingly popular during the 1990s when it was used to determine a handful of severe genetic disorders, such as sickle-cell anemia, Tay–Sachs disease, Duchenne&#x27;s muscular dystrophy, and beta-thalassemia.

==Indications and applications==
PGD is used primarily for genetic disease prevention, by selecting only those embryos that do not have a known genetic disorder. PGD may also be used to increase chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection.

PGD is frequently employed for the detection of autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked abnormalities. However, its utilization in screening for mitochondrial disorders is less common, primarily due to the unpredictable characteristics of mitochondrial heteroplasmy. In cases of mitochondrial heteroplasmy, some mitochondria within a cell bear the mutation, while others do not. The ratio of mutant mitochondria plays a crucial role in determining both the expression of the disease (its impact on offspring) and the severity of the disease.

=== Monogenic disorders ===
PGD is available for a large number of monogenic disorders—that is, disorders due to a single gene only (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked)—or of chromosomal structural aberrations (such as a balanced translocation). PGD helps these couples identify embryos carrying a genetic disease or a chromosome abnormality, thus avoiding diseased offspring. The most frequently diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, Beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1. The most common dominant diseases are myotonic dystrophy, Huntington&#x27;s disease and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease; and in the case of the X-linked diseases, most of the cycles are performed for fragile X syndrome, haemophilia A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Though it is quite infrequent, some centers report PGD for mitochondrial disorders or two indications simultaneously.

PGD is also now being performed in a disease called hereditary multiple exostoses (MHE/MO/HME).

In addition, there are infertile couples who carry an inherited condition and who opt for PGD as it can be easily combined with their IVF treatment.

===Pregnancy chances===

Preimplantation genetic profiling (PGP) has been suggested as a method to determine embryo quality in in vitro fertilization, in order to select an embryo that appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, as the results of PGP rely on the assessment of a single cell, PGP has inherent limitations as the tested cell may not be representative of the embryo because of mosaicism. Furthermore, a study found that diagnoses of the biopsies from the same embryos at two separate laboratories matched up only 50% of the time.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of existing randomized controlled trials came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGP as measured by live birth rate. On the contrary, for women of advanced maternal age, PGP significantly lowers the live birth rate. Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and chromosomal mosaicism are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGP. Normal live births of healthy offspring after transfers of embryos deemed aneuploid by PGP have been reported worldwide.

Alternative methods to determine embryo quality for prediction of pregnancy rates include microscopy as well as profiling of RNA and protein expression.

===HLA matching===

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of embryos, so that the child&#x27;s HLA matches a sick sibling, availing for cord-blood stem cell donation. The child is in this sense a &quot;savior sibling&quot; for the recipient child. HLA typing has meanwhile become an important PGD indication in those countries where the law permits it. The HLA matching can be combined with the diagnosis for monogenic diseases such as Fanconi anaemia or beta thalassemia in those cases where the ailing sibling is affected with this disease, or it may be exceptionally performed on its own for cases such as children with leukaemia. The main ethical argument against is the possible exploitation of the child, although some authors maintain that the Kantian imperative is not breached since the future donor child will not only be a donor but also a loved individual within the family.

===Cancer predisposition===
A more recent application of PGD is to diagnose late-onset diseases and (cancer) predisposition syndromes. Since affected individuals remain healthy until the onset of the disease, frequently in the fourth decade of life, there is debate on whether or not PGD is appropriate in these cases. Considerations include the high probability of developing the disorders and the potential for cures. For example, in predisposition syndromes, such as BRCA mutations which predispose the individual to breast cancer, the outcomes are unclear. Although PGD is often regarded as an early form of prenatal diagnosis, the nature of the requests for PGD often differs from those of prenatal diagnosis requests made when the mother is already pregnant. Some of the widely accepted indications for PGD would not be acceptable for prenatal diagnosis.

=== For late-onset conditions ===
A woman carrying the gene for early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease used preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to ensure that her child would not inherit this condition. Ethical questions arise regarding the decision to allow an individual aware of their own susceptibility to a late-onset disease to have a child free of the gene, despite the risk that the child may lose a parent prematurely. Some argue that this decision is ethical, asserting that the desire for reproduction is as legitimate for these individuals as for others seeking infertility services. Comparisons are drawn with other medical situations, such as assisted reproduction for individuals with HIV or other serious illnesses. Although the child may face risks of early bereavement, the argument put forth is that the psychological trauma does not render the child&#x27;s life devoid of clear benefits. Therefore, assisting parents in reproducing in these circumstances is not considered to cause undue or unnecessary suffering to the child.

===Sex discernment===
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis provides a method of prenatal sex discernment even before implantation, and may therefore be termed &quot;preimplantation sex discernment&quot;. Potential applications of preimplantation sex discernment include:
* A complement to specific gene testing for monogenic disorders, which can be very useful for genetic diseases whose presentation is linked to the sex, such as, for example, X-linked diseases.
* Ability to prepare for any sex-dependent aspects of parenting.
* Sex selection. A 2006 survey found that 42 per cent of clinics that offer PGD have provided it for sex selection for non-medical reasons. Nearly half of these clinics perform it only for &quot;family balancing&quot;, which is where a couple with two or more children of one sex desire a child of the other, but half do not restrict sex selection to family balancing. In India, this practice has been used to select only male embryos although this practice is illegal. Opinions on whether sex selection for non-medical reasons is ethically acceptable differ widely, as exemplified by the fact that the ESHRE Task Force could not formulate a uniform recommendation.

In the case of families at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one&#x27;s phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.

===Minor disabilities===
PGD has occasionally been used to select an embryo for the presence of a particular disease or disability, such as deafness, in order that the child would share that characteristic with the parents.

=== Non-medical traits ===

The potential controversial use of PGD could arise with genetic tests targeting non-medical traits such as hearing, sexual orientation, height, beauty, or intelligence. Some tests, like those for GJB2 mutations linked to hereditary deafness, might lead to requests for PGD to avoid or favor these traits. Ethical concerns include potential harm to affected communities, such as the deaf. Similar questions would arise with a genetic test for sexual orientation, raising concerns about discrimination. Some insist on a complete ban on selecting such traits, fearing more serious implications like genetic engineering of offspring. However, definitive judgments on these issues cannot be made until such tests are closer to practical reality.

==Classification==
There are three distinguished types of Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) depending on the defects evaluated.

PGT-A, also called preimplantational genetic screening (PGS), improves pregnancy rates by allowing the discard of aneuploids and the selection of euploid embryos for transfer. Euploid embryos are more likely to implant and develop into a healthy pregnancy. NGS and FISH are the most frequently techniques used for the diagnosis of monosomies, trisomies and poliploidies. Primary candidates for PGT-A can include the following:
* Women of advanced maternal age
* Couples with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss
* Couples with repeated IVF failure
* Male partner swith severe male factor infertility.

PGT-A is particularly beneficial for women of advanced maternal age. As women age, especially beyond 35 years, the quality of their eggs declines due to an increased risk of errors during the meiotic division of oocytes. These errors lead to chromosomal abnormalities, such as aneuploidies (monosomies, trisomies, and polyploidies), which can impair embryo development and result in failed pregnancies or genetic disorders.

Because of this, PGT-A has become an essential tool for identifying and selecting euploid embryos (embryos with the correct number of chromosomes) for transfer, significantly improving the chances of a successful pregnancy. Studies have shown that the probability of chromosomal abnormalities increases with maternal age, making PGT-A an important step in fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization (IVF) for older women.

PGT-M evaluates monogenic diseases are being evaluated in the embryo. Monogenic disorders are caused by single-gene mutations (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked). Previously, PCR was used for PGT-M. Recently, array and NGS technology are used.

PGT-SR takes every structural abnormality in the chromosome into account (translocations, inversions, duplications, insertions, deletions). Techniques used include PCR, FISH and NGS.

==Technical aspects==
PGD is a form of genetic diagnosis performed prior to implantation. This implies that the patient&#x27;s oocytes should be fertilized &quot;in vitro&quot; and the embryos kept in culture until the diagnosis is established. It is also necessary to perform a biopsy on these embryos in order to obtain material on which to perform the diagnosis. The diagnosis itself can be carried out using several techniques, depending on the nature of the studied condition. Generally, PCR-based methods are used for monogenic disorders and FISH for chromosomal abnormalities and for sexing those cases in which no PCR protocol is available for an X-linked disease. These techniques need to be adapted to be performed on blastomeres and need to be thoroughly tested on single-cell models prior to clinical use. Finally, after embryo replacement, surplus good quality unaffected embryos can be cryopreserved, to be thawed and transferred back in a next cycle.

===Obtaining embryos===
Currently, all PGD embryos are obtained by assisted reproductive technology, although the use of natural cycles and &quot;in vivo&quot; fertilization followed by uterine lavage was attempted in the past and is now largely abandoned. In order to obtain a large group of oocytes, the patients undergo controlled ovarian stimulation (COH). COH is carried out either in an agonist protocol, using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for pituitary desensitisation, combined with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) or recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or an antagonist protocol using recombinant FSH combined with a GnRH antagonist according to clinical assessment of the patient&#x27;s profile (age, body mass index (BMI), endocrine parameters). hCG is administered when at least three follicles of more than 17 mm mean diameter are seen at transvaginal ultrasound scan. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is scheduled 36 hours after hCG administration. Luteal phase supplementation consists of daily intravaginal administration of 600 μg of natural micronized progesterone.

Oocytes are carefully denudated from the cumulus cells, as these cells can be a source of contamination during the PGD if PCR-based technology is used. In the majority of the reported cycles, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is used instead of IVF. The main reasons are to prevent contamination with residual sperm adhered to the zona pellucida and to avoid unexpected fertilization failure. The ICSI procedure is carried out on mature metaphase-II oocytes and fertilization is assessed 16–18 hours after. The embryo development is further evaluated every day prior to biopsy and until transfer to the woman&#x27;s uterus. During the cleavage stage, embryo evaluation is performed daily on the basis of the number, size, cell-shape and fragmentation rate of the blastomeres. On day 4, embryos were scored in function of their degree of compaction and blastocysts were evaluated according to the quality of the throphectoderm and inner cell mass, and their degree of expansion.

===Biopsy procedures===
As PGD can be performed on cells from different developmental stages, the biopsy procedures vary accordingly. Theoretically, the biopsy can be performed at all preimplantation stages, but only three have been suggested: on unfertilised and fertilised oocytes (for polar bodies, PBs), on day three cleavage-stage embryos (for blastomeres) and on blastocysts (for trophectoderm cells).

The biopsy procedure always involves two steps: the opening of the zona pellucida and the removal of the cells. There are different approaches to both steps, including mechanical, chemical, and physical (Tyrode&#x27;s acidic solution) and laser technology for the breaching of the zona pellucida, extrusion or aspiration for the removal of PBs and blastomeres, and herniation of the trophectoderm cells.

====Polar body biopsy====

A &quot;polar body biopsy&quot; is the sampling of a polar body, which is a small haploid cell that is formed concomitantly as an egg cell during oogenesis, but which generally does not have the ability to be fertilized. Compared to a blastocyst biopsy, a polar body biopsy can potentially be of lower costs, less harmful side-effects, and more sensitive in detecting abnormalities. The main advantage of the use of polar bodies in PGD is that they are not necessary for successful fertilisation or normal embryonic development, thus ensuring no deleterious effect for the embryo. One of the disadvantages of PB biopsy is that it only provides information about the maternal contribution to the embryo, which is why cases of maternally inherited autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders that are exclusively maternally transmitted can be diagnosed, and autosomal recessive disorders can only partially be diagnosed. Another drawback is the increased risk of diagnostic error, for instance due to the degradation of the genetic material or events of recombination that lead to heterozygous first polar bodies.

====Cleavage-stage biopsy (blastomere biopsy)====
Cleavage-stage biopsy is generally performed the morning of day three post-fertilization, when normally developing embryos reach the eight-cell stage. The biopsy is usually performed on embryos with less than 50% of anucleated fragments and at an eight-cell or later stage of development. A hole is made in the zona pellucida and one or two blastomeres containing a nucleus are gently aspirated or extruded through the opening.
The main advantage of cleavage-stage biopsy over PB analysis is that the genetic input of both parents can be studied. On the other hand, cleavage-stage embryos are found to have a high rate of chromosomal mosaicism, putting into question whether the results obtained on one or two blastomeres will be representative for the rest of the embryo. It is for this reason that some programs utilize a combination of PB biopsy and blastomere biopsy. Furthermore, cleavage-stage biopsy, as in the case of PB biopsy, yields a very limited amount of tissue for diagnosis, necessitating the development of single-cell PCR and FISH techniques.
Although theoretically PB biopsy and blastocyst biopsy are less harmful than cleavage-stage biopsy, this is still the prevalent method. It is used in approximately 94% of the PGD cycles reported to the ESHRE PGD Consortium. The main reasons are that it allows for a safer and more complete diagnosis than PB biopsy and still leaves enough time to finish the diagnosis before the embryos must be replaced in the patient&#x27;s uterus, unlike blastocyst biopsy.
Of all cleavage-stages, it is generally agreed that the optimal moment for biopsy is at the eight-cell stage. It is diagnostically safer than the PB biopsy and, unlike blastocyst biopsy, it allows for the diagnosis of the embryos before day 5. In this stage, the cells are still totipotent and the embryos are not yet compacting. Although it has been shown that up to a quarter of a human embryo can be removed without disrupting its development, it still remains to be studied whether the biopsy of one or two cells correlates with the ability of the embryo to further develop, implant, and grow into a full-term pregnancy.

Not all methods of opening the zona pellucida have the same success rate because the well-being of the embryo and blastomere may be impacted by the procedure used for the biopsy. Zona drilling with acid Tyrode&#x27;s solution (ZD) was looked at in comparison to partial zona dissection (PZD) to determine which technique would lead to more successful pregnancies and have less of an effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. ZD uses a digestive enzyme like pronase which makes it a chemical drilling method. The chemicals used in ZD may have a damaging effect on the embryo. PZD uses a glass microneedle to cut the zona pellucida which makes it a mechanical dissection method that typically needs skilled hands to perform the procedure. In a study that included 71 couples, ZD was performed in 26 cycles from 19 couples and PZD was performed in 59 cycles from 52 couples. In the single-cell analysis, there was a success rate of 87.5% in the PZD group and 85.4% in the ZD group. The maternal age, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and other variables did not differ between the ZD and PZD groups. It was found that PZD led to a significantly higher rate of pregnancy (40.7% vs 15.4%), ongoing pregnancy (35.6% vs 11.5%), and implantation (18.1% vs 5.7%) than ZD. This suggests that using the mechanical method of PZD in blastomere biopsies for preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be more proficient than using the chemical method of ZD. The success of PZD over ZD could be attributed to the chemical agent in ZD having a harmful effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. Currently, zona drilling using a laser is the predominant method of opening the zona pellucida. Using a laser is an easier technique than using mechanical or chemical means. However, laser drilling could be harmful to the embryo and it is very expensive for in vitro fertilization laboratories to use especially when PGD is not a prevalent process as of modern times. PZD could be a viable alternative to these issues.

====Blastocyst biopsy====
In an attempt to overcome the difficulties related to single-cell techniques, it has been suggested to biopsy embryos at the blastocyst stage, providing a larger amount of starting material for diagnosis. It has been shown that if more than two cells are present in the same sample tube, the main technical problems of single-cell PCR or FISH would virtually disappear. On the other hand, as in the case of cleavage-stage biopsy, the chromosomal differences between the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm (TE) can reduce the accuracy of diagnosis, although this mosaicism has been reported to be lower than in cleavage-stage embryos.

TE biopsy has been shown to be successful in animal models such as rabbits, mice and primates. These studies show that the removal of some TE cells is not detrimental to the further &quot;in vivo&quot; development of the embryo.

Human blastocyst-stage biopsy for PGD is performed by making a hole in the ZP on day three of &quot;in vitro&quot; culture. This allows the developing TE to protrude after blastulation, facilitating the biopsy. On day five post-fertilization, approximately five cells are excised from the TE using a glass needle or laser energy, leaving the embryo largely intact and without loss of inner cell mass. After diagnosis, the embryos can be replaced during the same cycle, or cryopreserved and transferred in a subsequent cycle.

There are two drawbacks to this approach, due to the stage at which it is performed. First, only approximately half of the preimplantation embryos reach the blastocyst stage. This can restrict the number of blastocysts available for biopsy, limiting in some cases the success of the PGD. McArthur and coworkers report that 21% of the started PGD cycles had no embryo suitable for TE biopsy. This figure is approximately four times higher than the average presented by the ESHRE PGD consortium data, where PB and cleavage-stage biopsy are the predominant reported methods. On the other hand, delaying the biopsy to this late stage of development limits the time to perform the genetic diagnosis, making it difficult to redo a second round of PCR or to rehybridize FISH probes before the embryos should be transferred back to the patient.

====Cumulus cell sampling====
Sampling of cumulus cells can be performed in addition to a sampling of polar bodies or cells from the embryo. Because of the molecular interactions between cumulus cells and the oocyte, gene expression profiling of cumulus cells can be performed to estimate oocyte quality and the efficiency of an ovarian hyperstimulation protocol, and may indirectly predict aneuploidy, embryo development and pregnancy outcomes.

===Non-invasive methods===
Traditional embryo biopsy can be invasive and costly. Therefore, researchers have an ongoing quest to find a less invasive methods for preimplantation genetic testing. Studies on new non-invasive preimplantation genetics screening methods such as blastocoel fluid and spent embryo media have recently been published as an alternative to traditional methods.

==== Using blastocoel fluid ====
During a normal IVF process, good practice to vitrify embryos increases the chance of a healthy pregnancy. During the process of vitrification a developed blast is dehydrated and it and its blastocoel cavity collapses for the freezing process. There are many methods that have been used to facilitate the collapse including laser-pulse, repeated micropipetting, microneedle puncture or microsuction. Normally this fluid would then be discarded, however with preimplantation genetic testing of BL, this fluid is saved and then tested for DNA. This DNA is thought to be from cells that have gone through apoptosis found in the developing embryo.

==== Using blastocyst culture conditioned medium ====
Another method for less invasive preimplantation genetic testing involves testing the culture media the embryo has developed in. It has been noted that the embryo releases DNA fragments from the cells that have died within the incubation period. With this knowledge, scientists have reasoned that they could isolate this DNA and use it for preimplantation genetic testing.

==== Benefits and consequences ====
While there is conflicting evidence as to whether or not the more traditional methods of preimplantation genetic testing are harmful to the embryo, there are newer methods for less invasive and equally effective testing methods using blastocoel fluid and spent embryo media. Two problems with these alternatives are the minimal amount of DNA there is to work with and whether or not this technology is accurate. Both of these concerns were recently addressed by Kuznyetsov, who decided to use both methods, combining the amount of DNA retrieved from both techniques. Once the DNA was isolated it was used for preimplantation genetic testing. The results showed that when both methods (blastocyst fluid and embryo spent media) were used in combination, they showed a cordance rate for the whole chromosome copy of 87.5% when compared to the trophectoderm, 96.4% when compared to the whole blastocyst (gold standard). Additionally after amplification using this new method they were able to produce 25.0–54.0 ng/ul of DNA per sample. With traditional methods such as trophectoderm they collected 10 to 44 ng/ul.

===Genetic analysis techniques===
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the two commonly used, first-generation technologies in PGD. PCR is generally used to diagnose monogenic disorders and FISH is used for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities (for instance, aneuploidy screening or chromosomal translocations). Over the past few years, various advancements in PGD testing have allowed for an improvement in the comprehensiveness and accuracy of results available depending on the technology used. Recently a method was developed allowing to fix metaphase plates from single blastomeres. This technique in conjunction with FISH, m-FISH can produce more reliable results, since analysis is done on whole metaphase plates

In addition to FISH and PCR, single cell genome sequencing is being tested as a method of preimplantation genetic diagnosis. This characterizes the complete DNA sequence of the genome of the embryo.

====FISH====
FISH is the most commonly applied method to determine the chromosomal constitution of an embryo. In contrast to karyotyping, it can be used on interphase chromosomes, so that it can be used on PBs, blastomeres and TE samples. The cells are fixated on glass microscope slides and hybridised with DNA probes. Each of these probes are specific for part of a chromosome, and are labelled with a fluorochrome.

Dual FISH was considered to be an efficient technique for determination of the sex of human preimplantation embryos and the additional ability to detect abnormal chromosome copy numbers, which is not possible via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Currently, a large panel of probes are available for different segments of all chromosomes, but the limited number of different fluorochromes confines the number of signals that can be analysed simultaneously.

The type and number of probes that are used on a sample depends on the indication. For sex determination (used for instance when a PCR protocol for a given X-linked disorder is not available), probes for the X and Y chromosomes are applied along with probes for one or more of the autosomes as an internal FISH control. More probes can be added to check for aneuploidies, particularly those that could give rise to a viable pregnancy (such as a trisomy 21). The use of probes for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21 and 22 has the potential of detecting 70% of the aneuploidies found in spontaneous abortions.

In order to be able to analyse more chromosomes on the same sample, up to three consecutive rounds of FISH can be carried out. In the case of chromosome rearrangements, specific combinations of probes have to be chosen that flank the region of interest. The FISH technique is considered to have an error rate of 5–10%.

The main problem of the use of FISH to study the chromosomal constitution of embryos is the elevated mosaicism rate observed at the human preimplantation stage. A meta-analysis of more than 800 embryos came to the result that approximately 75% of preimplantation embryos are mosaic, of which approximately 60% are diploid–aneuploid mosaic and approximately 15% aneuploid mosaic. Li and co-workers found that 40% of the embryos diagnosed as aneuploid on day 3 turned out to have a euploid inner cell mass at day 6. Staessen and collaborators found that 17.5% of the embryos diagnosed as abnormal during PGS, and subjected to post-PGD reanalysis, were found to also contain normal cells, and 8.4% were found grossly normal. As a consequence, it has been questioned whether the one or two cells studied from an embryo are actually representative of the complete embryo, and whether viable embryos are not being discarded due to the limitations of the technique. Nevertheless, mosaic embryos can be transferred but only if there are not euploids available, having previously informed patients about the risks and doing a prenatal diagnose preferably.

====PCR====
Kary Mullis conceived PCR in 1985 as an &quot;in vitro&quot; simplified reproduction of the &quot;in vivo&quot; process of DNA replication. Taking advantage of the chemical properties of DNA and the availability of thermostable DNA polymerases, PCR allows for the enrichment of a DNA sample for a certain sequence. PCR provides the possibility to obtain a large quantity of copies of a particular stretch of the genome, making further analysis possible. It is a highly sensitive and specific technology, which makes it suitable for all kinds of genetic diagnosis, including PGD. Currently, many different variations exist on the PCR itself, as well as on the different methods for the posterior analysis of the PCR products.

When using PCR in PGD, one is faced with a problem that is nonexistent in routine genetic analysis: the minute amounts of available genomic DNA. As PGD is performed on single cells, PCR has to be adapted and pushed to its physical limits, and use the minimum amount of template possible: which is one strand. This implies a long process of fine-tuning of the PCR conditions and a susceptibility to all the problems of conventional PCR, but several degrees intensified. The high number of needed PCR cycles and the limited amount of template makes single-cell PCR very sensitive to contamination. Another problem specific to single-cell PCR is the allele drop out (ADO) phenomenon. It consists of the random non-amplification of one of the alleles present in a heterozygous sample. ADO seriously compromises the reliability of PGD as a heterozygous embryo could be diagnosed as affected or unaffected depending on which allele would fail to amplify. This is particularly concerning in PGD for autosomal dominant disorders, where ADO of the affected allele could lead to the transfer of an affected embryo.

Several PCR-based assays have been developed for various diseases like the triplet repeat genes associated with myotonic dystrophy and fragile X in single human somatic cells, gametes and embryos.

====Next-generation sequencing concept====
The core philosophy of massive parallel sequencing used in NGS is adapted from shotgun sequencing developed to sequence longer sections of DNA. NGS technologies read the target DNA templates randomly. The target DNA or entire genome is broken into small pieces and then those DNA pieces are ligated to designated adapters for random reading during in-parallel DNA synthesis. The &quot;read length&quot; corresponds to the actual number of continuous sequenced bases. The read lengths are much shorter than with Sanger sequencing, which is why NGS results are called &quot;short reads&quot;.

From 2014, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is being performed in the PGT. NGS is a group of techniques capable of sequencing great amounts of DNA at a reasonable cost and time. It can give us a general perspective of the complete embryo genome, including the mitochondrial one. Those techniques are based on sequencing short reads around 400 bases each and overlapping these reads with powerful alignment software.

Likewise, NGS is used to detect aneuploidies in the 24 chromosomes and single-gene defects when there is an indication from the carrier parents. The main advantage is that NGS can combine the detection of both aneuploidies and monogenic diseases with a single biopsy and has reduced affordable costs, making it more accessible.

Two examples of NGS are the pyrosequencing and the reversible dye terminator.

=== Pyrosequencing ===
Pyrosequencing technique is based on sequencing by-synthesis principle and on the detection of released pyrophosphate during DNA synthesis. It employs a series of four enzymes to accurately detect nucleic acid sequences during the synthesis.

Cycles of four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) are separately added to the reaction mixture iteratively. The cascade starts with a nucleic acid polymerization reaction in which inorganic pyrophosphate is released as a result of nucleotide incorporation by polymerase. Each nucleotide incorporation event is followed by release of inorganic pyrophosphate in a quantity equimolar to the amount of incorporated nucleotide. The released pyrophosphate is quantitatively converted to ATP by ATP sulfurylase in the presence of APS. The generated ATP drives the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin, producing visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount of ATPs. During this synthesis process, the DNA strand is extended by complementary nucleotides, and the DNA sequence is demonstrated by the pyrogram on a screen. The overall reaction from polymerization to light detection takes place within 3–4 seconds at room temperature. ATP sulfurylase converts pyrophosphate to ATP in approximately 1.5 seconds and the generation of light by luciferase takes place in less than 0.2 seconds.

=== Limits ===
Along with the benefits offered by these technologies, there are a number of challenges, both technical and ethical that must be addressed and solved before NGS technologies enter the clinical arena of embryo diagnosis. One limitation will be the interpretation of the massive sequence data generated by NGS technologies. Background polymorphisms must be distinguished from potentially disease-causing mutations and copy number variations. By selective recovery and subsequent sequencing of genomic loci of interest, generated data and efforts for analysis can be reduced significantly compared with a whole-genome sequencing approach.

===Establishing a diagnosis===
The establishment of a diagnosis in PGD is not always straightforward. The criteria used for choosing the embryos to be replaced after FISH or PCR results are not equal in all centres.
In the case of FISH, in some centres only embryos are replaced that are found to be chromosomally normal (that is, showing two signals for the gonosomes and the analysed autosomes) after the analysis of one or two blastomeres, and when two blastomeres are analysed, the results should be concordant. Other centres argue that embryos diagnosed as monosomic could be transferred, because the false monosomy (i.e. loss of one FISH signal in a normal diploid cell) is the most frequently occurring misdiagnosis. In these cases, there is no risk for an aneuploid pregnancy, and normal diploid embryos are not lost for transfer because of a FISH error. Moreover, it has been shown that embryos diagnosed as monosomic on day 3 (except for chromosomes X and 21), never develop to blastocyst, which correlates with the fact that these monosomies are never observed in ongoing pregnancies.

Diagnosis and misdiagnosis in PGD using PCR have been mathematically modelled in the work of Navidi and Arnheim and of Lewis and collaborators. The most important conclusion of these publications is that for the efficient and accurate diagnosis of an embryo, two genotypes are required. This can be based on a linked marker and disease genotypes from a single cell or on marker/disease genotypes of two cells. An interesting aspect explored in these papers is the detailed study of all possible combinations of alleles that may appear in the PCR results for a particular embryo. The authors indicate that some of the genotypes that can be obtained during diagnosis may not be concordant with the expected pattern of linked marker genotypes, but are still providing sufficient confidence about the unaffected genotype of the embryo. Although these models are reassuring, they are based on a theoretical model, and generally the diagnosis is established on a more conservative basis, aiming to avoid the possibility of misdiagnosis. When unexpected alleles appear during the analysis of a cell, depending on the genotype observed, it is considered that either an abnormal cell has been analysed or that contamination has occurred, and that no diagnosis can be established. A case in which the abnormality of the analysed cell can be clearly identified is when, using a multiplex PCR for linked markers, only the alleles of one of the parents are found in the sample. In this case, the cell can be considered as carrying a monosomy for the chromosome on which the markers are located, or, possibly, as haploid. The appearance of a single allele that indicates an affected genotype is considered sufficient to diagnose the embryo as affected, and embryos that have been diagnosed with a complete unaffected genotype are preferred for replacement. Although this policy may lead to a lower number of unaffected embryos suitable for transfer, it is considered preferable to the possibility of a misdiagnosis.

===Preimplantation genetic haplotyping===

Preimplantation genetic haplotyping (PGH) is a PGD technique wherein a haplotype of genetic markers that have statistical associations to a target disease are identified rather than the mutation causing the disease.

Once a panel of associated genetic markers have been established for a particular disease it can be used for all carriers of that disease. In contrast, since even a monogenic disease can be caused by many different mutations within the affected gene, conventional PGD methods based on finding a specific mutation would require mutation-specific tests. Thus, PGH widens the availability of PGD to cases where mutation-specific tests are unavailable.

PGH also has an advantage over FISH in that FISH is not usually able to make the differentiation between embryos that possess the balanced form of a chromosomal translocation and those carrying the homologous normal chromosomes. This inability can be seriously harmful to the diagnosis made. PGH can make the distinction that FISH often cannot. PGH does this by using polymorphic markers that are better suited at recognizing translocations. These polymorphic markers are able to distinguish between embryos that carried normal, balanced, and unbalanced translocations. FISH also requires more cell fixation for analysis whereas PGH requires only transfer of cells into polymerase chain reaction tubes. The cell transfer is a simpler method and leaves less room for analysis failure.

===Embryo transfer and cryopreservation of surplus embryos===
Embryo transfer is usually performed on day three or day five post-fertilization, the timing depending on the techniques used for PGD and the standard procedures of the IVF centre where it is performed.

With the introduction in Europe of the single-embryo transfer policy, which aims at the reduction of the incidence of multiple pregnancies after ART, usually one embryo or early blastocyst is replaced in the uterus. Serum hCG is determined at day 12. If a pregnancy is established, an ultrasound examination at 7 weeks is performed to confirm the presence of a fetal heartbeat. Couples are generally advised to undergo PND because of the, albeit low, risk of misdiagnosis.

It is not unusual that after the PGD, there are more embryos suitable for transferring back to the woman than necessary. For the couples undergoing PGD, those embryos are very valuable, as the couple&#x27;s current cycle may not lead to an ongoing pregnancy. Embryo cryopreservation and later thawing and replacement can give them a second chance to pregnancy without having to redo the cumbersome and expensive ART and PGD procedures.

==Side effects to embryo==
PGD/PGS is an invasive procedure that requires a serious consideration, according to Michael Tucker, Ph.D., Scientific Director and Chief Embryologist at Georgia Reproductive Specialists in Atlanta. One of the risks of PGD includes damage to the embryo during the biopsy procedure (which in turn destroys the embryo as a whole), according to Serena H. Chen, M.D., a New Jersey reproductive endocrinologist with IRMS Reproductive Medicine at Saint Barnabas. Another risk is cryopreservation where the embryo is stored in a frozen state and thawed later for the procedure. About 20% of the thawed embryos do not survive. There has been a study indicating a biopsied embryo has a less rate of surviving cryopreservation. Another study suggests that PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy results in a significantly lower live birth rate for women of advanced maternal age. Also, another study recommends the caution and a long term follow-up as PGD/PGS increases the perinatal death rate in multiple pregnancies.

In a mouse model study, PGD has been attributed to various long-term risks, including a weight gain and memory decline; a proteomic analysis of adult mouse brains showed significant differences between the biopsied and the control groups, of which many are closely associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer&#x27;s and Down syndrome.

==Ethical issues==
PGD has raised ethical issues, although this approach could reduce reliance on fetal deselection during pregnancy. The technique can be used for prenatal sex discernment of the embryo, and thus potentially can be used to select embryos of one sex in preference of the other in the context of &quot;family balancing&quot;. The use of PGD for gender variety has been reported in India, where an IVF programme in Bombay is now providing PGD to select male offspring as the second child of couples who have already had a daughter. Because of the importance of a male heir in India, those couples might have resorted to abortion if pregnant with a female fetus (even though illegal for that purpose). In that setting PGD for sex selection for gender variety appears to be justified. It may be possible to make other &quot;social selection&quot; choices in the future that introduce socio-economic concerns. Only unaffected embryos are implanted in a woman&#x27;s uterus; those that are affected are either discarded or donated to science.

Objections to PGD based on its effect on embryos replay debates over abortion and embryo status that have occurred in many other contexts, from abortion to embryonic stem cell research. People who think that the embryo or fetus is a person will object to creating and destroying embryos, and oppose most uses of PGD. Others believe that preimplantation embryos are too rudimentary in development to have interests or rights, but that they deserve special respect as the first stage toward a new person.

PGD has the potential to screen for genetic issues unrelated to medical necessity, such as intelligence and beauty, and against negative traits such as disabilities. The medical community has regarded this as a counterintuitive and controversial suggestion. The prospect of a &quot;designer baby&quot; is closely related to the PGD technique, creating a fear that increasing frequency of genetic screening will move toward a modern eugenics movement. On the other hand, a principle of procreative beneficence is proposed, which is a putative moral obligation of parents in a position to select their children to favor those expected to have the best life. An argument in favor of this principle is that traits (such as empathy, memory, etc.) are &quot;all-purpose means&quot; in the sense of being of instrumental value in realizing whatever life plans the child may come to have. Walter Veit has argued that there is no intrinsic moral difference between &#x27;creating&#x27; and &#x27;choosing&#x27; a life, thus making eugenics a natural consequence of accepting the principle of procreative beneficence.

===Disabilities===
In 2006, three percent of PGD clinics in the US reported having selected an embryo for the presence of a disability. Couples involved were accused of purposely harming a child. This practice is notable in dwarfism, where parents intentionally create a child who is a dwarf. In the selection of a saviour sibling to provide a matching bone marrow transplant for an already existing affected child, there are issues including the commodification and welfare of the donor child.

By relying on the result of one cell from the multi-cell embryo, PGD operates under the assumption that this cell is representative of the remainder of the embryo. This may not be the case as the incidence of mosaicism is often relatively high. On occasion, PGD may result in a false negative result leading to the acceptance of an abnormal embryo, or in a false positive result leading to the deselection of a normal embryo.

Another problematic case is the cases of desired non-disclosure of PGD results for some genetic disorders that may not yet be apparent in a parent, such as Huntington disease. It is applied when patients do not wish to know their carrier status but want to ensure that they have offspring free of the disease. This procedure can place practitioners in questionable ethical situations, e.g. when no healthy, unaffected embryos are available for transfer and a mock transfer has to be carried out so that such patients do not suspect that they are carriers. The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) ethics task force currently recommends using exclusion testing instead. Exclusion testing is based on a linkage analysis with polymorphic markers, in which the parental and grandparental origin of the chromosomes can be established. This way, only embryos are replaced that do not contain the chromosome derived from the affected grandparent, avoiding the need to detect the mutation itself.

====Criticisms of PGD====
Because of the sensitivity of the issue, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has sparked a rich debate in academia and beyond.

Those who are against the possibility of discarding an embryo to avoid the risk of disability (such as the possible adverse selection of embryos that might develop &quot;disabilities&quot; such as deafness) argue that if the only two possibilities are &quot;existence and nonexistence&quot; (&quot;coming into the world&quot; or &quot;not coming into the world&quot;), granting them the right to come into the world is better than the alternative of not existing.

Another widely used argument for rejecting preimplantation genetic diagnosis involves the meaning of the term &quot;disability&quot; (Bickenach &amp; Chatterji, 2003). The language of medicine describes disability as something whose functionalities deviate from a normal functioning. However, much of the disability community emphasizes that disability is often determined by the way society structures the world. Thus, the concepts of &quot;normalcy&quot; and &quot;health&quot; are relative and depend on time, place, and society. Opponents of PGD argue against avoiding the birth of people with disabilities through preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and that people must first determine how to define what disability is.

====Support for PGD====
The literature highlights three most common types of arguments in favor of preimplantation genetic diagnosis.
The first type of argument is mainly made by a part of academia that believes that a disability or disorder likely implies a reduced quality of life for the unborn child. The second most common type of argument focuses primarily on the duties of parents in relation to the human flourishing of the individual. This argument feeds on the idea that parents have an obligation and responsibility to ensure minimum living conditions for the unborn child.

A final category of argument is one that emphasizes the importance of bringing individuals with disabilities and disorders into the world with the consideration of how much they can contribute to the socioeconomic growth of society, suggesting these individuals would not be able to contribute to improving the status quo and well-being of society as a whole.

====Legal status====
In Japan, preimplantation genetic testing-monogenic (PGT-M) has been the topic of fierce debate by individuals suffering from genetic diseases on the one hand, and feminist groups and disability activist groups on the other. As Croydon notes, &quot;prospective PGT-M patients, such as individuals of reproductive age impacted by a disability and their spouses...have wanted to take advantage of the technology,&quot; but they have faced opposition from &quot;groups campaigning for women&#x27;s and disabled people&#x27;s rights [which] include individuals who see the genetic testing of embryos in one or all of the following ways: 1) it puts undue pressure on the women involved, conveying the message to them that they are only allowed to reproduce if they are bringing into the world a healthy offspring; 2) it reinforces existing discriminatory attitudes in society towards disabled people; and 3) the circumvention of disease through the reproductive process reduces the need in the scientific community to continue the pursuit of developing treatments/cures for people who currently live with disability.&quot; Ultimately, the use of PGT-M has remained restrictive in Japan and is informally regulated by the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG).

===Intersex traits===

PGD allows discrimination against those with intersex traits. Georgiann Davis argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits led full and happy lives. Morgan Carpenter highlights the appearance of several intersex variations in a list by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority of &quot;serious&quot; &quot;genetic conditions&quot; that may be de-selected in the UK, including 5-alpha reductase deficiency and androgen insensitivity syndrome, traits evident in elite women athletes and &quot;the world&#x27;s first openly intersex mayor&quot;. Organisation Intersex International Australia has called for the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council to prohibit such interventions, noting a &quot;close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature&quot;.

In 2015, the Council of Europe published an Issue Paper on &quot;Human rights and intersex people&quot;, remarking:

=== Savior siblings ===
PGD combined with HLA (human leukocyte antigen) matching allows couples to select for embryos that are unaffected with a genetic disease in hopes of saving an existing, affected child. The &quot;savior sibling&quot; would conceivably donate life-saving tissue that is compatible to his/her brother or sister. Some ethicists argue that the &quot;savior siblings&quot; created from this procedure would be treated as commodities. Another argument against selecting for &quot;savior siblings&quot; is that it leads to genetically engineered &quot;designer babies&quot;. This argument prompts a discussion between the moral distinction of enhancing traits and preventing disease. Finally, opponents of &quot;savior siblings&quot; are concerned with the welfare of the child, mainly that the procedure will cause emotional and psychological harm to the child.

Currently in the United States, no formal regulation or guideline exists. The ethical decisions regarding this procedure is in the discretion of health care providers and their patients. In contrast, the UK&#x27;s use of PGD is regulated by the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act (HFEA), which requires clinics performing this technique to attain a license and follow strict criteria.

==Religious objections==

Some religious organizations disapprove of this procedure. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, takes the position that it involves the destruction of human life. and besides that, opposes the necessary in vitro fertilization of eggs as contrary to Aristotelian principles of nature. Orthodox Judaism, by contrast, supports PGD.

==Psychological factor==
A meta-analysis that was performed indicates research studies conducted in PGD underscore future research. This is due to positive attitudinal survey results, postpartum follow-up studies demonstrating no significant differences between those who had used PGD and those who conceived naturally, and ethnographic studies which confirmed that those with a previous history of negative experiences found PGD as a relief. Firstly, in the attitudinal survey, women with a history of infertility, pregnancy termination, and repeated miscarriages reported having a more positive attitude towards preimplantation genetic diagnosis. They were more accepting towards pursuing PGD. Secondly, likewise to the first attitudinal study, an ethnographic study conducted in 2004 found similar results. Couples with a history of multiple miscarriages, infertility, and an ill child, felt that preimplantation genetic diagnosis was a viable option. They also felt more relief; &quot;those using the technology were actually motivated to not repeat pregnancy loss&quot;. In summary, although some of these studies are limited due to their retrospective nature and limited samples, the study&#x27;s results indicate an overall satisfaction of participants for the use of PGD. However, the authors of the studies do indicate that these studies emphasize the need for future research such as creating a prospective design with a valid psychological scale necessary to assess the levels of stress and mood during embryonic transfer and implantation.

==Policy and legality==

===Canada===
Prior to implementing the Assisted Human Reproduction Act (AHR) in 2004, PGD was unregulated in Canada. The Act banned sex selection for non-medical purposes.

Due to 2012&#x27;s national budget cuts, the AHR was removed. The regulation of assisted reproduction was then delegated to each province. This delegation provides provinces with a lot of leeway to do as they please. As a result, provinces like Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have put almost the full costs of IVF on the public healthcare bill. Dr. Santiago Munne, developer of the first PGD test for Down&#x27;s syndrome and founder of Reprogenetics, saw these provincial decisions as an opportunity for his company to grow and open more Reprogenetics labs around Canada. He dismissed all controversies regarding catalogue babies and states that he had no problem with perfect babies.

Ontario, however, has no concrete regulations regarding PGD. Since 2011, the Ministry of Children and Youth Services in Ontario advocates for the development government-funded &#x27;safe fertility&#x27; education, embryo monitoring and assisted reproduction services for all Ontarians. This government report shows that Ontario not only has indefinite regulations regarding assisted reproduction services like IVF and PGD, but also does not fund any of these services. The reproductive clinics that exist are all private and located only in Brampton, Markham, Mississauga, Scarborough, Toronto, London and Ottawa. In contrast, provinces such as Alberta and Quebec not only have more clinics, but have also detailed laws regarding assisted reproduction and government funding for these practices.

===Germany===
Before 2010, the usage of PGD was in a legal grey area. In 2010, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled that PGD can be used in exceptional cases. On 7 July 2011, the Bundestag passed a law that allows PGD in certain cases. The procedure may only be used when there is a strong likelihood that parents will pass on a genetic disease, or when there is a high genetic chance of a stillbirth or miscarriage. On 1 February 2013, the Bundesrat approved a rule regulating how PGD can be used in practice.

===Hungary===

In Hungary, PGD is allowed in case of severe hereditary diseases (when genetic risk is above 10%).
The preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy (PGS/PGD-A) is an accepted method as well. It is currently recommended in case of multiple miscarriages, and/or several failed IVF treatments, and/or when the mother is older than 35 years. Despite being an approved method, PGD-A is available at only one Fertility Clinic in Hungary.

===India===
In India, Ministry of Family Health and Welfare, regulates the concept under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994. The Act was further been revised after 1994 and necessary amendment were made are updated timely on the official website of the Indian Government dedicated for the cause. The use of PGD for sex identification/selection of child is illegal in India.

===Mexico===
As of 2006, clinics in Mexico legally provided PGD services.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, where the right to reproductive freedom is a constitutionally protected right, it has been proposed that the state can only limit PGD to the degree that parental choice can harm the prospective child or to the degree that parental choice will reinforce societal prejudice.

===Ukraine===
The preimplantation genetic diagnosis is allowed in Ukraine and from November 1, 2013, is regulated by the order of the Ministry of health of Ukraine &quot;On approval of the application of assisted reproductive technologies in Ukraine&quot; from 09.09.2013 No. 787.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, assisted reproductive technologies are regulated under the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act (HFE) of 2008. However, the HFE Act does not address issues surrounding PGD. Thus, the HFE Authority (HFEA) was created in 2003 to act as a national regulatory agency that issues licenses and monitors clinics providing PGD. The HFEA only permits the use of PGD where the clinic concerned has a license from the HFEA and sets out the rules for this licensing in its Code of Practice. Each clinic, and each medical condition, requires a separate application where the HFEA check the suitability of the genetic test proposed and the staff skills and facilities of the clinic. Only then can PGD be used for a patient.

The HFEA strictly prohibits sex selection for social or cultural reasons, but allows it to avoid sex-linked disorders. They state that PGD is not acceptable for, &quot;social or psychological characteristics, normal physical variations, or any other conditions which are not associated with disability or a serious medical condition.&quot; It is however accessible to couples or individuals with a known family history of serious genetic diseases. Nevertheless, the HFEA regards intersex variations as a &quot;serious genetic disease&quot;, such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a trait associated with some elite women athletes. Intersex advocates argue that such decisions are based on social norms of sex gender, and cultural reasons.

===United States===
No uniform system for regulation of assisted reproductive technologies, including genetic testing, exists in the United States. The practice and regulation of PGD most often fall under state laws or professional guidelines as the federal government does not have direct jurisdiction over the practice of medicine. To date, no state has implemented laws directly pertaining to PGD, therefore leaving researchers and clinicians to abide by guidelines set by the professional associations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that all clinics providing IVF must report pregnancy success rates annually to the federal government, but reporting of PGD use and outcomes is not required. Professional organizations, such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), have provided limited guidance on the ethical uses of PGD. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) states that &quot;PGD should be regarded as an established technique with specific and expanding applications for standard clinical practice.&quot; They also state, &quot;While the use of PGD for the purpose of preventing sex-linked diseases is ethical, the use of PGD solely for sex selection is discouraged.&quot;

In 2024, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in an influential case that frozen embryos in test tubes should be considered children, thus raising complex legal questions with implications for reproductive care extending far beyond Alabama.

===Spain===
In Spain, preimplantation genetic diagnosis is not allowed to be carried out in an open and accessible way for everyone to avoid eugenics. That is why it is only legalized in high-risk cases.

There are three essential requirements (except for the exceptions allowed by the Bioethics Committees) for a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to be carried out on the embryo. All three must be met:
* That the embryo may contain an early-onset disease. If it were a late-onset disease, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, it could not be prevented by preimplantation diagnosis.
* That the disease to be detected is not currently curable. If it were a serious but curable disease, it could not be prevented by this method. An example of a pathology with no current cure on which preimplantation diagnosis could be applied would be Retinoblastoma, which is an autosomal recessive monogenic disease.
* That the disease is life-threatening or seriously affects the mental or psychomotor development of the child.

Any type of disease that does not meet these three requirements must go through a Bioethics Committee and be approved by it before PGD can be performed.

Legislation began late, ten years after the birth in the United Kingdom of Louise Brown, the first person conceived by IVF.

==References in popular culture==
* PGD features prominently in the 1997 film &quot;Gattaca.&quot; The movie is set in a near-future world where PGD/IVF is the most common form of reproduction. In the movie parents routinely use PGD to select desirable traits for their children such as height, eye color, and freedom from even the smallest of genetic predispositions to disease. The ethical consequences of PGD are explored through the story of the main character who faces discrimination because he was conceived without such methods.
* PGD is mentioned in the 2004 novel &quot;My Sister&#x27;s Keeper&quot; by the characters as the main character, Anna Fitzgerald, was created through PGD to be a genetic match for her APL positive sister Kate so that she could donate bone marrow at her birth to help Kate fight the APL. It is also mentioned in the book that her parents received criticism for the act.

==Information on clinic websites==
In a study of 135 IVF clinics, 88% had websites, 70% mentioned PGD and 27% of the latter were university- or hospital-based and 63% were private clinics. Sites mentioning PGD also mentioned uses and benefits of PGD far more than the associated risks. Of the sites mentioning PGD, 76% described testing for single-gene diseases, but only 35% mentioned risks of missing target diagnoses, and only 18% mentioned risks for loss of the embryo. 14% described PGD as new or controversial. Private clinics were more likely than other programs to list certain PGD risks like for example diagnostic error, or note that PGD was new or controversial, reference sources of PGD information, provide accuracy rates of genetic testing of embryos, and offer gender selection for social reasons.

<doc id="562187" wikidata="Q4805958" url="?curid=562187" title="Ashte kashte">
<text>Ashta-kashte is a race board game from Bengal akin to the Cross and Circle family for two to four players originating in India. Although there is no evidence for that, it is considered by some as the direct ancestor of &quot;Pachisi&quot;. It is played on a board with a 7-by-7 grid on it. It is similar to Chowka bhara, or to Ashtam changam pe where there is a 5-by-5 grid on the board.

Players race their pieces around the board, spiralling inwards to be the first to get all of their pieces to the centre. Movement is controlled by throwing cowry shells, but there is also an element of strategy to the game.

Also called &quot;Koli kaDam&quot; in Hyderabad, or &quot;Champul&quot; in other parts of India. 

==Equipment==
The board is a square divided into seven rows and columns. The outer centre squares on each side of the board are specially marked. They are the starting squares for each player, and also function as &quot;resting squares&quot;.

Each player has four pieces.

Four cowry shells are used as dice. They are thrown and the number of shells that lie with their openings upwards indicates the number of spaces a player should move:

==Play==
Players begin with no pieces on the board. A piece may enter the board on any throw of the cowries and moves to the square corresponding to the throw. Each player starts on their own starting square and moves around the board in an anticlockwise spiral. The paths of each player are different because each player starts on a different square and moves inwards at a different position on the board.

A player can capture an opponent&#x27;s piece by landing their piece upon it. The captured piece is removed from the board and must start again. A piece cannot land on an opponent&#x27;s piece that is on a resting square.

If a player lands their piece on another of their own pieces, it becomes a double. Doubles cannot be passed over by single pieces (whether the player&#x27;s or the opponent&#x27;s), and they can only be captured by other doubles. In addition, the two pieces that make up the double may be moved together.

The end (centre square) can only be reached by a direct throw. If a player throws a number larger than that needed to reach the end, they must move another piece or wait till their next turn.
