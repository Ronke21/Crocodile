<text>The Cadillac Allanté is a two-door, two-seater luxury roadster marketed by Cadillac from 1987 until 1993. The Allanté was based on a Cadillac chassis and running gear with a convertible body style with a folding soft top and an available removable hardtop. The bodies were built in Italy by coachbuilder Pininfarina which were flown to Detroit for final assembly. Over 21,000 were built during its seven-year production run.

==Conception and design==
To maintain luxury market position in the 1980s, Cadillac sought an aspirational model that would combine the prestige of a European design with the renown of a European coachbuilder — to help Cadillac compete with Mercedes and Jaguar. It would become the first modern-era two-passenger Cadillac roadster, and the first to wear the Cadillac name since the Cadillac Series 355 roadster of the 1930s.

Cadillac General Manager Bob Burger sent engineers to Italy in 1982 to meet with designers and coachbuilders to explore a partnership with Cadillac. According to program manager Ed Anderson, the team identified Pininfarina as their top choice, and Cadillac chose them to design the Allanté, under the direction of Sergio Pininfarina, working with a team of designers including Mario Vernacchia. 

At GM, Chuck Jordan was torn because delegating the design to Pininfarina implied that GM&#x27;s 3,000 internal designers were unable to pen the design. GM stylist Wayne Kady along with Vice President of Design, Irv Rybicki, fought to have the design crafted in-house, Kady later saying GM leadership had decided to go with an Italian design even before Cadillac’s designers began work. 

The in-house designers were hurt and angry. Kady said to management, “We’ve done all your bread and butter cars through the years, but when it’s time to do a historic and fun project, you give it to someone else.” Cadillac General Manager Bob Burger later told the in-house designers the company was &quot;looking for a car with a designer name to it. It’s like Levi&#x27;s, it’s that tag on the back of the jeans.&quot;

Chuck Jordan (at the time assigned in Europe with Opel) was not to examine Pininfarina&#x27;s work. However, he could see the design before it was frozen for development because he was friends with Sergio Pininfarina. As later told by Maria Vernacchia, Jordan referred to the Allanté as ‘The New Spirit of Cadillac,’ only suggesting a front grille similar to the typical Ferrari&#x27;s with a classic rectangular grid design. Pininfarina opened a new facility specifically for Allanté manufacture outside Turin in rural San Giorgio Canavese, as a dedicated vehicle assembly plant, part of what would become a very long assembly process.

The car was built on a unique platform known as the V-body, which was a shortened version of the E platform that underpinned the Cadillac Eldorado and other contemporary personal luxury coupes.

The nameplate &quot;Allanté&quot; was selected by General Motors from 1,700 computer-generated potential names. Originally designed to compete with the Mercedes-Benz SL and Jaguar XJS, the Allanté initially featured a slightly modified variant of the 4.1 L V8 used across Cadillac&#x27;s model line. This was expanded to 4.5 L in 1989, and upgraded to the 4.6 L &quot;L37 Northstar&quot; in its final year, 1993.

All Allanté models featured a fully electronic instrument and control panel, which was angled towards the driver, without knobs or manual controls. GM also implemented electronic controls in select premium mid-to-late 1980s luxury vehicles such as the Buick Reatta, Buick Riviera, and Oldsmobile Toronado Trofeo. However, these vehicles included a touchscreen control panel called the Graphic Control Center (GCC), which the Allanté did not.

==Air Bridge production==
The Allanté incorporated an international production arrangement similar to the early 1950s Nash-Healey two-passenger sports car. The Allanté bodies were designed and manufactured in Italy by Pininfarina and were shipped to the U.S. for final assembly with domestically manufactured chassis and engine, eventually leading it to be referred to as &quot;the world&#x27;s longest assembly line.&quot; Specially equipped Boeing 747s departed from Turin International Airport with 56 bodies at a time, arriving at Detroit&#x27;s Coleman A. Young International Airport about northeast of Cadillac&#x27;s new Hamtramck Assembly plant, known as the &quot;Allanté Air Bridge&quot;. The expensive shipping process stemmed from GM&#x27;s recent closing of Fisher Body Plant #18, which had supplied Cadillac bodies since 1921. It was not the first time that Cadillac joint-ventured with Pininfarina, having subcontracted body production for the 1959 Eldorado Brougham and design and coachworks for several one-offs, customs, and concept cars.

==Model year changes==
===1987===

The front-wheel drive Allanté roadster had a transverse multi-port fuel injected variant of GM&#x27;s aluminum HT-Cadillac 4100 V8, along with roller valve lifters, high-flow cylinder heads, and a tuned intake manifold. The suspension was independent strut front and rear, with Bosch ABS III four-wheel disc brakes. A removable aluminum hardtop, Delco-GM/Bose Symphony Sound System (a $905 option on other Cadillacs), the industry&#x27;s first power retractable AM/FM/Cellular Telephone antenna, and a complex lamp-out module that substituted an adjacent lamp for a burned-out bulb in the exterior lighting system until the dead one could be replaced were all standard. The only option was a cellular telephone installed in a lockable center console. The base price was $54,700 ($ in dollars ).

===1988===
The 1988 model year Allanté featured revised front seat headrests and a power decklid pulldown as standard equipment. Analog instruments, in place of the standard digital dash cluster, were now available as a no-charge option. The base price was raised to $56,533, with the cellular telephone still the only extra-cost option. In a comparison test by &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine, the 1988 Allanté was ranked behind the Mercedes 560 SL, but ahead of the brand new Buick Reatta.

===1989===

The 1989 model year base price rose to $57,183. Allanté&#x27;s engine, the new 273ci (4.5 L) V8, produced , and with of torque. Unlocking the trunk also unlocked the side doors if the key was rotated twice – similar to Mercedes-Benz and BMW. As a theft-deterrent, Allanté added GM&#x27;s Pass Key (Personal Automotive Security System), using a resistor pellet within the ignition key to render the fuel system and starter inoperative if an incorrect ignition key was used. Allanté also received a new speed-sensitive damper system called Speed Dependent Damping Control, or SD²C. This system firmed the suspension at and again at . The firmest setting was also used starting from a standstill until . Another change was a variable-assist steering system.

===1990===

For the 1990 model year, a lower-priced ($53,050) companion model with a cloth convertible roof and without the removable aluminum hardtop was available. This version, including the hardtop, was $58,638. By midyear, prices were dropped to $57,813 for the hardtop/convertible and $51,500 for the convertible, including a $650 Gas Guzzler Tax and a $550 destination charge. The fully integrated cellular telephone, equipped from the factory on just 36 cars this year, was available for an additional $1,195. Allanté&#x27;s bumper-to-bumper new car warranty, seven years and , was three years longer than other Cadillacs, and an additional of coverage. Allanté owners also received a unique toll-free number for service or concerns. Headlamp washers and dual 10-way Recaro seating remained standard. A driver&#x27;s side airbag was added to the leather-wrapped steering wheel, eliminating the telescoping steering wheel — which retained its tilt feature. The analog instrument cluster – introduced the previous year – was standard on the convertible (available at no extra cost on the hardtop/convertible), with 358 cars equipped with the analog cluster. 

The power mirror control moved from the right of the steering column on the instrument panel to a new location on the upper end of the driver&#x27;s door armrest. The power seat switches (previously mounted on the face of the seat base) were relocated to the lower side trim of the seat base facing the door panels. The 3-channel garage door opener base mounted on the header panel above the windshield was eliminated when a new sun visor design was introduced this year. Traction control was added – the first front-wheel drive automobile with a V8 to be equipped as such. The system was designed to cut fuel to four cylinders to reduce power and optimize traction. 

The electronically controlled shock absorbers were re-tuned to remain in &quot;soft&quot; mode up to , up from . A revised audio system allowed a CD and a cassette player to be added as standard equipment. Of the 2,523 built for 1990, only five were exported – four to Canada and one to Germany.

===1991===

For the 1991 model year, a power-latching mechanism was added for the convertible top, and redesigned the top stowage cover mechanism to address customer complaints. The Bose stereo system was upgraded to 200 watts, and the digital instrument cluster, featured in all but 275 Allanté models this year, was repriced (it was now a $495 option for the convertible model). Prices began at $57,260, although a midyear price drop brought the Allanté convertible down to $55,900 and the hardtop/convertible down to $61,450 (from $62,810). Allanté had 16.3 cubic feet of storage (when using the pass-through compartment into the cabin area). Of the 1,928 models produced for 1991, only seven were manufactured for export – five to Canada, one to Italy, and another to Puerto Rico. Canadian models offered a kilometer-based instrument cluster, daytime running lamps, and an engine block heater as standard equipment. In contrast, the Italian model featured a list of European-mandated modifications, including breakaway side mirrors, specific European headlamps and turn signals, a front tow hook, rear fog lamps, deletion of the deck-lid mounted center brake light, a wet-arm windshield washer system, coolers for the power steering and automatic transmission fluids, and a revised steering column to compensate for the removal of the driver&#x27;s airbag.

===1992===
The Allanté for 1992 was priced at $58,470 for the convertible and $64,090 for the hardtop/convertible. Both prices included the mandated gas guzzler tax, now $1,300. As it had been the custom for a few years, price drops were announced midyear: $57,170 for the convertible and $62,790 for the removable hardtop. The optional digital cluster was priced at $495 (available at no charge on the removable hardtop model). However, only 187 cars were equipped with the standard analog cluster this year. Also available on the convertible at extra cost was a pearl white paint group (option YL3) priced at $700 (a total of 443 made during 1992). 1992 was the last year of the multi-adjustable Recaro seating design. Four of the 1,698 produced this year were built for export, all to Canada. As with the previous year, the most popular exterior was &quot;47U – Euro Red&quot; with 549 units, while the least popular was &quot;49U – Light Blue Metallic&quot; with 15 finished in that color. Three shades of leather were available for the interior, the colors and their production totals: Charcoal (859), Natural Beige (652), Maroon (187), (50) Polo Green, and one Pearl Flax (O4U).

===1993===

For the 1993 model, Allanté was offered in a single model configuration: as a soft-top convertible priced at $59,975 (not including a mandatory $1,700 gas guzzler tax for vehicles sold in the United States). Options included the removable aluminum hardtop, LCD digital instrument cluster ($495) in place of the standard analog instruments, pearl coat paint option ($700, in Flax or Canyon Yellow, with Hawaiian Orchid added midyear) and chrome squeeze-cast aluminum wheels.

The 1993 models received the significantly more powerful Northstar DOHC V8 engine rated at at 5600 rpm and of torque at 4400 rpm. A new unequal-length control arm rear suspension was introduced, shared with the Seville and Eldorado. To offset increased costs, the 200-watt Bose stereo was dropped in favor of GM&#x27;s Delco &quot;Premium Symphony Sound System&quot;; the intelligent lighting module was eliminated; and 1993 models featured less expensive Lear-designed eight-way dual power seats, replacing the previous Recaro seats. Interior changes included the addition of an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a revised shifter grip. Other model year changes included Road Sensing Suspension, an active damper management system, revised disc brakes, revised variable-assist power steering rack, deeper front spoiler, and single-piece side windows, which eliminated the stationary forward vent window. 

The 1993 Allanté was also chosen as the 1992 pace car for the 76th Indianapolis 500. The pace car was driven by Bobby Unser. Three modified 1993 Pace Cars had only the seat belts, lighted roll bar, and air intake modified from a stock production Allanté&#x27;s. In addition to the official Allanté Pace cars provided for the race, thirty stock 1993 Allantés used as Festival/Pace Cars and 58 stock 1992 Allanté Festival/Pace cars used by drivers and crews at the opening parade and the race&#x27;s closing. Al Unser Jr&#x27;s 1993 Allanté Festival/Pace car was featured at the 2012 and 2013 Keel&#x27;s &amp; Wheel&#x27;s Concours D’Elegance in Seabrook, Texas. Bobby Unser was Grand Marshal in 2012, and Al Unser Jr. was Grand Marshal in 2013.

Production reached 4,670 for the model year 1993, with 85 shipped to Canada and 30 were exported overseas: France (1), Austria (2), Belgium (5), Germany (5), Switzerland (6), and Japan (11).

==Discontinuation==
Despite a scheduled facelift for the model, the last Allanté built was flown from Turin, Italy, on July 2, 1993, and completed at Detroit-Hamtramck 14 days later. With 21,430 built, assemblies averaged just a little more than 3,000 a year throughout the car&#x27;s lifetime. Production officially ended on July 16, 1993.

==Production numbers==
Pininfarina production records state that 21,395 bodies were made from 1986 to 1993.

<text>Ontario Hydro, established in 1906 as the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, was a publicly owned electricity utility in the Province of Ontario. It was formed to build transmission lines to supply municipal utilities with electricity generated by private companies already operating at Niagara Falls, and soon developed its own generation resources by buying private generation stations and becoming a major designer and builder of new stations. As most of the readily developed hydroelectric sites became exploited, the corporation expanded into building coal-fired generation and then nuclear-powered facilities. Renamed as &quot;Ontario Hydro&quot; in 1974, by the 1990s it had become one of the largest, fully integrated electricity corporations in North America.

==Origins==

The notion of generating electric power on the Niagara River was first entertained in 1888, when the Niagara Parks Commission solicited proposals for the construction of an electric scenic railway from Queenston to Chippawa. The Niagara Falls Park &amp; River Railway was granted the privilege in 1892, and by 1900 it was using a dynamo of which was the largest in Canada. Starting in 1899, several private syndicates sought privileges from the commission for generating power for sale, including:

* the Canadian Niagara Power Company, backed by British investors
* the Ontario Power Company, backed by American investors
* the Electrical Development Company, backed by the Toronto Street Railway and the Toronto Electric Light Company (controlled by William Mackenzie, Frederic Thomas Nicholls and Henry Mill Pellatt)

By 1900, a total capacity of was in development at Niagara, and concern was expressed as to whether such natural resources were being best exploited for the public welfare. In June 1902, an informal convention was held at Berlin (now Kitchener), which commissioned a report by Daniel B. Detweiler, Elias W.B. Snider and F.S. Spence, who recommended in February 1903 that authority be sought from the Ontario Legislature to allow municipal councils to organize a cooperative to develop, transmit, buy and sell electrical energy. The provincial government of George William Ross refused to allow this, and it was only after its loss in the 1905 election that work began on creating a public utility. During that election campaign, James Pliny Whitney (who would become Premier) declared:

=== Creation of Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario===
In May 1906, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario (&quot;Hydro&quot; or &quot;HEPCO&quot;) was formed and its first commissioners were Adam Beck, John S. Hendrie, and Cecil B. Smith, HEPCO was a unique hybrid of a government department, crown corporation and municipal cooperative that coexisted with the existing private companies. It was a &quot;politically rational&quot; rather than a &quot;technically efficient&quot; solution that depended on the watershed election of 1905.

On January 1, 1907, referendums in Toronto and 18 other municipalities approved the provisional contracts that their councils had concluded with HEPC, and subsequent referendums one year later authorized utility bond issues for the construction of local distribution systems. The victories in Toronto were in large part due to the leadership and commitment of Adam Beck&#x27;s ally, William Peyton Hubbard. The first transmission lines began providing power to southwestern Ontario in 1910. Berlin (Kitchener) would be the first city in Ontario to get hydroelectric power in long-distance transmission lines from Niagara Falls, on October 11, 1910.

The commission&#x27;s process of expansion was from municipality to municipality, generally in the following manner:

* the municipal council would approach the commission, expressing its interest in establishing a local distribution system;
* Hydro engineers would then visit the municipality to assess current facilities and probable total load, before producing estimates as to the total cost of extending transmission lines to the municipal boundary, the delivered price of power, and building or upgrading the community&#x27;s distribution system;
* if the council agreed, a provisional contract would be negotiated between the council and the commission, subject to ratification by the voters;
* upon successful ratification, thirty-year debentures would be issued by the municipality to cover construction and equipment expenses, and Hydro would then build a tie line to the nearest point in its network.

During the 1920s, Hydro&#x27;s network expanded significantly:

* In September 1921, Hydro acquired the Toronto Electric Light Company and various railway interests, making it the largest electric power system in the world, and legislation passed in 1922 provided that any claims arising before December 1920 against the acquired companies or their properties, if not notified to the Commission in prescribed manner and pursued on or before October 1, 1923, would &quot;be forever barred.&quot;
* In 1921 and 1924, legislative amendments authorized grant-in-aid programs that encouraged rural electrification in Ontario by reducing unit rates in the areas to be served.
* By the end of the 1920s, most remaining private power producers were unable to withstand any expansion by Hydro into their service area, and some survived only because Hydro did not see the need to enter their markets.

In 1926, the Ferguson government gave its approval for Abitibi Power and Paper Company to develop the Abitibi Canyon, the largest such development since the Niagara River, in preference to incurring more debt for Ontario Hydro. The development was encouraged through secret commitments for long-term purchases of electricity and indemnification of Hydro against any losses. Questions were asked at the time as to how the additional in capacity would be used, as there were virtually no customers for it. When Abitibi was placed in receivership in 1932, legislation was passed over the following years to allow Ontario Hydro to take control of several Abitibi power developments. Certain dealings relating to the 1933 acquisition came to be known as the &quot;great Abitibi swindle,&quot; which resulted in the fall of the Henry government in the 1934 Ontario election, to be succeeded by that of Mitchell Hepburn.

In 1939, the commission was given authority to regulate all other electricity generators, thus bringing all private utilities in the province under its supervision. It also received authority to acquire any utility that was not producing at its capacity.

In 1948, HEPCO changed most of its system from 25 Hz to 60 Hz. However, the Fort Erie area south of Niagara Falls stayed on the remaining 25 Hz generators until 1966, and this area had electricity throughout the 1965 Eastern Seaboard Blackout.

By the 1950s the commission was operating as a single integrated system. As demand rose in the post-war period, Ontario Hydro started expanding its generation system bringing on line many new hydroelectric stations. In 1953, Ontario Hydro began to interconnect with other utilities, the first interconnection being the Keith-Waterman line in Windsor which crosses the Detroit River to Detroit, Michigan interconnecting with Detroit Edison in the United States. This line was originally constructed at 120,000 volts and was later upgraded to 230,000 volts in 1973. Shortly thereafter, other interconnections with New York State were built. The first coal-fired generating stations in the system were also built in this period. The expansion of coal continued during the 1960s and 1970s but was overtaken by the development of nuclear power.

==Hydro-Electric Railways==

In 1912, Adam Beck began to promote the creation and operation of electric interurban railways in the territory served by the commission, and the Legislative Assembly granted authority to do so in &quot;The Hydro-Electric Railway Act, 1914&quot;. Changes in government policy and public sentiment in the 1920s restricted their development, and all such operations ceased in the 1930s (with the exception of the Hamilton Street Railway streetcar system, which continued until 1946).

==Expansion==
In the 1960s, HEPCO was the first utility in North America to utilize ultra-high voltage transmission lines. Planning for the UHV lines began in 1960 and in 1967, HEPCO put into service transmission lines carrying 500,000 volts that carry power from hydroelectric sources in remote Northern Ontario to high load areas in southern Ontario such as Toronto, London, and Ottawa. By 1970 all but the most remote municipal power systems in Ontario were organized into a single grid. During the 1970s and 1980s, Ontario Hydro gradually expanded the 500 kV transmission system into what it is today.

Before its own nuclear power stations started coming onstream, Ontario Hydro had the following capacity and output:

===HEPCO becomes Ontario Hydro===
In 1974, the commission was reconstituted as a crown corporation known as Ontario Hydro, which had been the commission&#x27;s nickname. In many Canadian provinces, including Ontario, hydroelectric power is so common that &quot;hydro&quot; has become synonymous with electric power regardless of the actual source of the electricity.

==Nuclear power stations==
In the late 1950s, the corporation became involved in development, design and construction of CANDU nuclear power stations.

In 1965, the first commercial sized station came on line at Douglas Point.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Ontario Hydro&#x27;s nuclear generating program expanded with the building of the first four units of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station followed by stations at Bruce Nuclear Generating Station and a second four units at Pickering. By the late 1980s, Ontario Hydro operated one of the largest fleets of nuclear-powered generating stations in the world.

The Bruce Nuclear Generating Station became the largest nuclear generating station in the world in 2011 (and has remained the largest) by net electrical power rating, total reactor count, and number of operational reactors.

The last nuclear plant to be built in Ontario, Darlington Nuclear Generating Station, was planned in the 1970s. Construction started in 1981, but because of a series of political decision to delay construction, construction took an inordinately long time. Costs continued to mount during the delay and the plant was completed in 1993. This delay in the schedule caused the projected costs to increase tremendously, from an initial projected cost of $7.0 billion to $14.5 billion. The delay accounted for seventy percent of the cost increase.

==Management, overcapacity and cost overruns==
The quality of Hydro&#x27;s management, given its size and scope of operations, had long been a concern. In 1922, Dougall Carmichael, then Minister without Portfolio, announced to the Legislature that he was quitting his position as Commissioner because Hydro &quot;was either inefficient or dishonest.&quot; He was forced to retract the allegation of dishonesty.

In the 1970s, controversy arose relating to Hydro&#x27;s expansion strategy, and several inquiries were held:

* in 19741975, the Solandt Commission issued reports with respect to transmission lines that were to be constructed between Nanticoke and Pickering, and from Lennox to Oshawa.
* in 1980, the Porter Commission recommended that Hydro change its focus from capacity expansion to demand management, but the report was ignored.

In the 1980s there were large increases in the rates charged, arising from:

* cost increases in the construction of Darlington (as noted in the previous section),
* cost overruns for the supply of boilers by Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada at the existing nuclear stations, the total for which had ballooned to $850 million and
* the negotiation of take-or-pay contracts with Rio Algom and Denison Mines for the supply of uranium, prior to the collapse of world prices, which were subsequently cancelled in 1991 at a cost of $717 million.

In 1989, Ontario Hydro published a four-volume study, forecasting up to the year 2014, entitled &quot;Providing the Balance of Power&quot;, with different scenarios attempting to address the need for additional facilities to replace aging electricity generation stations. This was derailed when electricity consumption declined due to the recession of the early 1990s.

==Break-up==

In 1998, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the &quot;Energy Competition Act, 1998&quot;, which:

* authorized the establishment of a market in electricity
* reorganized Ontario Hydro into five companies: Ontario Power Generation (OPG), the Ontario Hydro Services Company (later renamed Hydro One), the Independent Electricity Market Operator (later renamed the Independent Electricity System Operator), the Electrical Safety Authority, and Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation. (The two commercial companies, Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, were intended to eventually operate as private businesses rather than as crown corporations.)

Ontario Hydro ceased operations on March 31, 1999. Its assets and functions were transferred by provincial statute to two commercial successor corporations, Ontario Power Generation Inc. and Ontario Hydro Services Company Inc., as well as to two not-for-profit agencies, the Independent Electricity Market Operator and the Electrical Safety Authority.

===Stranded debt===
On March 31, 1999, Ontario Hydro reported in its financial statements that it had long term debts of $26.2 billion and assets totalling $39.6 billion.

The fair value of its assets was substantially less than the $39.6 billion reported in the 1999 financial statements and therefore, in order to ensure the successor entities were financially solvent, the reorganization gave rise to $19.5 billion of stranded debt. The stranded debt was the shortfall between the fair value of Ontario Hydro&#x27;s assets and the value of Ontario Hydro&#x27;s total debt and other liabilities transferred to the new entities.

Since 2002, the stranded debt is being paid down through a Debt Retirement Charge levied upon Ontario ratepayers. The Debt Retirement Charge is 0.7 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity consumed in Ontario.

As of March 31, 2014, the remaining stranded debt was $2.6 billion. Beginning in 2016, the Ontario government removed the Debt Retirement Charge from residential electricity users’ electricity bills, and from all other electricity users’ bills by April 1, 2018.

<doc id="581313" wikidata="Q976362" url="?curid=581313" title="Farragut West station">
<text>Farragut West station is a Washington Metro station in Downtown Washington, D.C., United States. The side-platformed station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Blue, Orange and Silver Lines, the station is located just west of Farragut Square with two entrances on I Street at 17th and 18th Streets NW.

While it is only a block away (across the square) from Farragut North on the Red Line, there is no direct connection between the two stations. WMATA originally planned to have a single Farragut station that would serve as an alternate transfer station to ease congestion that would develop in Metro Center. However, it would have been constructed using the cut and cover method, disrupting the square above. Therefore, this proposal was not favored and the two separate stations were built instead. As part of its long-term capital improvement plan dated September 12, 2002, Metro has proposed building an underground pedestrian tunnel connecting this station with Farragut North. On October 28, 2011, Metro announced its Farragut Crossing program, allowing riders using a SmarTrip card up to 30 minutes to transfer for free by foot between Farragut West and Farragut North stations.

The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium and the opening of the Arlington Cemetery, Capitol South, Crystal City, Eastern Market, Federal Center SW, Federal Triangle, Foggy Bottom–GWU, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, McPherson Square, National Airport, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Potomac Avenue, Rosslyn, Smithsonian, and Stadium–Armory stations. This was the first station in the system to open without any pylons along the platform. Information which would be normally found on pylons is located on wall plaques. Orange Line service to the station began when the line opened on November 20, 1978. It was the system&#x27;s eighth-busiest station in 2023.

==History==
At 12:54 AM on October 7, 2019, two out-of-service trains, both consisting of 3000-series rail cars, collided between Foggy Bottom and Farragut West as both trains were being moved to their respective rail yards, affecting the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines all day the following day. Two drivers were injured due to the collision.

Between January 15 to January 21, 2021, this station was closed because of security concerns due to the Inauguration of Joe Biden.

<doc id="581314" wikidata="Q709319" url="?curid=581314" title="Bathinda">
<text>Bathinda is a city and municipal corporation in Punjab, India. The city is the administrative headquarters of Bathinda district. It is located in northwestern India in the Malwa Region, west of the capital city of Chandigarh and is the fifth largest city of Punjab. It is the second cleanest city in Punjab after Mohali.

Bathinda is home to the Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University, Central University of Punjab and AIIMS Bathinda. The city is also home to two modern thermal power plants, Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant and Guru Hargobind Thermal Plant at Lehra Mohabbat. Also located in the city is a fertiliser plant, two cement plants (Ambuja Cements and UltraTech Cement Limited), a large army cantonment, an air force station, a zoo, and a historic Qila Mubarak fort.

==History==
Bhatinda was changed to Bathinda to conform to the phonetical expression as locally pronounced. According to Henry George Raverty, Bathinda was known as &quot;Tabar-i-Hind&quot; (Labb-ut-Twarikh) or &quot;Tabarhindh&quot;, which roughly translates as ‘Gateway to India’. The earliest mention of Tabar-i-Hind occurs in the &quot;Jami-Ul-Hakayat&quot; written about 607 Hijri or 1211 AD.

In 1004, Mahmud of Ghazni besieged and captured the local fort, which was located on the route from the northwest into the rich Ganges valley. In 1190, Muhammad of Ghor  attacked and occupied the fort of Bathinda. Prithviraj Chauhan, the ruler of this region, managed to recover possession of the fort thirteen months later in 1191 after the First Battle of Tarain. However, Prithviraj Chauhan was killed in the Second Battle of Tarain and the fort of Bathinda once again came under the control of Muhammad Ghori.

In the 3rd century, Rao Bhatti is credited with establishing the modern town of Bathinda in the Lakhi jungle area. In 14th century, present region of bathinda was ruled by Bhati and Bhanot rulers of that time. 1488, Bathinda was conquered by Rao Bika, son of Jodha of Mandore (founder of Jodhpur) and became part of Bikaner princely state. Bathinda was an important fort in the area from Delhi to Lahore during the time of the Delhi Sultanate.

As per Ain-i-Akbari, Bathinda was included in the &quot;sarkar&quot; of Sirhind in the Subah of Delhi. In 1634, a battle named Battle of Lahira (at Lahira in Bathinda) was fought between Guru Hargobind and Mughals. The town had become an important trade and commercial centre under Mughal rule and the Mughal Emperors such as Akbar and Aurangzeb undertook many projects to enhance the fort of Bathinda.

In circa 1754, the town was conquered by Maharaja Ala Singh, the Maharaja of Patiala and since then it followed the history of erstwhile princely state of Patiala. With the dawn of independence and merger of Patiala and East Punjab States into a division called Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU), Bathinda became a full-fledged district with headquarters at Bathinda city.

Unscientific farming practices, that emerged after the introduction of Green Revolution, are also alleged to be a reason for growing incidence of not just cancer but also, high rates of spontaneous abortions, reproductive ailments, genetic deformities, anaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, fluorosis and a host of skin ailments including rashes and boils. Many young couples are also reported to be migrating out to save their children from adverse effects. Hence the government has completely banned the use of ground water in the city for drinking purposes.

<doc id="581315" wikidata="Q3700684" url="?curid=581315" title="Da Vinci's Notebook">
<text>Da Vinci&#x27;s Notebook (or simply DVN) was a comedic a cappella singing group. Former Artists-in-Residence at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, they performed specials on Comedy Central and PBS, and spent time as the &quot;house band&quot; on Washington radio&#x27;s WBIG-FM. They were also regular guests on the nationally syndicated &quot;Bob and Tom&quot; radio show.

==History==

===Formation and first years (1993–1997)===
In Alexandria, Virginia, during the summer of 1993, Bernie Muller-Thym, Greg &quot;Storm&quot; DiCostanzo, Paul Sabourin and Richard Hsu banded together to join a six-man a cappella group that was advertised in the Washington City Paper. Muller-Thym, DiCostanzo, and Sabourin met through the newspaper ad, while Hsu was a friend of DiConstanzo from the University of Maryland. The six-man group did not last and would disband soon after. Muller-Thym, DiCostanzo, Sabourin, and Hsu would then form Da Vinci&#x27;s Notebook. Bass singer Jay Jones would join later in the year, singing with the group until 1994.

Da Vinci&#x27;s Notebook made their debut at the 1994 Mid-Atlantic Harmony Sweepstakes, where they came in third place. In 1997, they came back and won the competition.

In 1995, the group self-released their debut cassette EP &quot;Somebody Else&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, featuring covers of popular songs.

===&quot;Bendy&#x27;s Law&quot; (1997)===
Da Vinci&#x27;s Notebook released their first full-length studio album, &quot;Bendy&#x27;s Law&quot;, in 1997, featuring guest appearances by Richard Greene and Joe Finetti of The Bobs, as well as by the band Moxy Früvous.

===&quot;The Life and Times of Mike Fanning&quot; (1999-2001)===
The group&#x27;s second full-length album, &quot;The Life and Times of Mike Fanning&quot;, was released on December 1, 1999. The album was produced by Richard Greene, who additionally provided vocals and previously made a guest appearance on &quot;Bendy&#x27;s Law&quot;. Other guest performances include Ball in the House and Michael Clem, Eddie Hartness, and Julie Murphy Wells from Eddie from Ohio. &quot;The Life and Times of Mike Fanning&quot; occasionally utilizes musical instruments as part of the backing tracks, which was new to the group&#x27;s albums.

Around this time, the group would also quit their day jobs to perform full time. Prior to performing full time, Hsu was a system engineer, Sabourin was a graphic specialist at a law firm, Muller-Thym was an accountant, and DiCostanzo was a financial analyst. The Washington Post made several articles about them during and after the release of &quot;The Life and Times of Mike Fanning&quot;.

===&quot;Enormous Penis&quot;, rise in popularity and &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; (2001-2002)===
In 2001, the song &quot;Enormous Penis&quot; was released as the group&#x27;s first and only single. Around this time, interest in the band spiked as they began to get played on the syndicated &quot;Bob and Tom&quot; radio show. The appearance on the show led to high demand for the single. Their signature songs played on the show included &quot;Another Irish Drinking Song&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Enormous Penis&quot;, &quot;Liposuction&quot;, &quot;Face Like Billy Joel&quot; and &quot;Title of the Song&quot;. &quot;Enormous Penis&quot; remains Da Vinci&#x27;s Notebook&#x27;s most popular song.

The group would release their final album, &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, in the following year, which included &quot;Enormous Penis&quot;. It was produced by Richard Greene, who had previously produced &quot;The Life and Times of Mike Fanning&quot;. Guest appearances include Eddie Hartness and Robbie Schaefer of Eddie from Ohio, Valerie Vigoda from GrooveLily, and a cappella singer-songwriter Sean Altman.

The newfound popularity brought by the Bob and Tom Show would bring more critics and fans to the album, with the album releasing to positive reviews. The album was the band&#x27;s final full release before disbanding in 2004.

===Final years, disbandment, and legacy (2002-present)===
The group toured, locally and nationally, for ten years. Highlights included some of the most prestigious folk venues and festivals on the East Coast, such as the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival.

In 2004, the band stopped touring and regular performances. Two of the members, Sabourin and DiCostanzo, then hit the road as a musical duo dubbed Paul and Storm. Da Vinci&#x27;s Notebook will still perform together on occasion for corporate shows.

In addition to their albums, Da Vinci&#x27;s Notebook also recorded a track called &quot;The Ballad of The Sneak&quot; for the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; cartoon website. This song was credited to the entire group, though it was only written and performed by Paul and Storm.

In 2013, the group&#x27;s song &quot;Another Irish Drinking Song&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Despicable Me 2&quot;, with new lyrics in the language of the Minions.

First settled in 819 by the monk Kūkai, Mount Kōya is primarily known as the world headquarters of the Kōyasan Shingon sect of Japanese Buddhism. Located on an 800-meter-high plain amid eight peaks of the mountain, which was the reason this location was selected, in that the terrain is supposed to resemble a lotus plant, the original monastery has grown into the town of Kōya.

Koya features a university dedicated to religious studies and 120 sub-temples, many of which offer lodging to pilgrims. Mount Kōya is also a common starting point to the associated with Kūkai.

== Sites ==
The mountain is home to the following famous sites:
* , the head temple of the Kōyasan Shingon Buddhism. Located roughly in the middle of the sanctuary, Kongobuji is colloquially known as &quot;Kōyasan-Issan&quot;, literally meaning &quot;the mountain of Kōya&quot;. The temple was built by the warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi for the benefit of his mother when she died. Originally named Seigan-ji, it was later renamed Kongōbu-ji in the Meiji Era.
* , at the heartland of the Mount Kōya settlement. &quot;Garan&quot; is a name for an area that has the main sacred buildings: a main hall, several pagodas, a scripture storage, a bell tower, a lecture hall, and other halls dedicated to important deities. There is also a shrine dedicated to the Shintō gods of that mountain area and in front of it an assembly hall (Sannō-dō). Danjō Garan is one of the two sacred spots around Mount Kōya. 
* , the &quot;Basic Great Pagoda&quot; that according to Shingon Buddhist doctrine represents the central point of a mandala covering all of Japan. Standing at 48.5 meters tall and situated right in the middle of Kōyasan, this pagoda was built as a seminary for the esoteric practices of Shingon Buddhism. This pagoda and the Okunoin Temple form a large sanctuary.
* , an assembly hall for special ceremonies dedicated to the Shintō gods guarding the area.
* , the mausoleum of Kūkai, surrounded by an immense graveyard (the largest in Japan).
* , the traditional route up the mountain with stone markers (&quot;ishi&quot;) every 109 meters (&quot;chō&quot;).
* , the main gate for Mount Kōya. This mammoth gate stands as the main entrance to Kōyasan. It is flanked on each side by Kongo warriors who guard the mountain.
*Tokugawa Family Tomb. This mausoleum was built by the third shōgun Iemitsu Tokugawa. It took ten years to build and is architecturally representative of the Edo Period. First Edo shōgun Ieyasu is enshrined on the right and the second shōgun Hidetada on the left. The structure is decorated with carvings and brass fittings.
* It also houses a replica of the Nestorian stele.

In 2004, UNESCO designated Kongōbu-ji on Mount Kōya, as part of the World Heritage Site &quot;Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range&quot;. Kōya Sankeimichi, the traditional pilgrimage route to Mount Kōya was also inscribed as part of the World Heritage Site.

The complex includes a memorial hall and cemetery honoring Japanese who were imprisoned or executed for committing atrocities during World War II. Within the cemetery are several memorials valorizing the brutal wartime aggression of Japan in East Asia.

== Access ==
Kōya-san is accessible primarily by the Nankai Electric Railway from Namba Station (in Osaka) to Gokurakubashi Station at the base of the mountain. A cable car from Gokurakubashi (&quot;Paradise Bridge&quot;) then whisks visitors to the top in 5 minutes. The entire trip takes about 1.5 hours on an express train or 2 hours by non-express.

Local automobile traffic can be very heavy on weekends until well into the evening. On weekdays, however, the mountain offers a pleasant drive followed by the excitement of reaching the monasteries lining the summit. Many Buddhist monasteries on the mountain function as hotels for visitors providing traditional accommodation with an evening meal and breakfast. Guest are also invited to participate in the morning services.

=== Buses ===
*There is a bus which runs non-stop from Kansai Airport to Mount Kōya, and it costs 2,000 yen (adult). The bus is operated by Kansai Airport Transportion and Willer Express.
*The &quot;Koyasan Marine Liner&quot; bus runs from Wakayamakō Station to Okunoin Bus stop on Mount Kōya, and it costs 2250 yen (adult). The bus is operated by Daijū Bus - &quot;大十バス&quot;.

<doc id="581319" wikidata="Q2493897" url="?curid=581319" title="Fursuit">
<text>Fursuits are custom-made anthropomorphic animal costumes owned and worn by cosplayers and members of the furry fandom, commonly known as &quot;furries&quot;; a furry who wears a fursuit is called a fursuiter. The term is believed to have been coined in 1993 by Robert King. Unlike mascot suits, which are usually affiliated with a team or organization, fursuits represent an original character created by their wearer, and are often better-fitting and more intricately crafted, with features such as a moving jaw. Fursuits are made in a wide range of styles, from cartoonish to highly realistic.

== History ==
An early fursuit worn by former Disney mascot wearer Robert Hill, based on the feminine character &quot;Hilda the Bamboid&quot;, appeared at the first ever furry convention, ConFurence 0, in 1989, but most furries of the time simply wore ears and tails, influenced by their intersection with the anime and sci-fi fandoms. Fursuits did not become widely known until the mid-1990s and the rise of the Internet, which led to the spread of ideas on costume making.

Most early fursuit making was done by the suit&#x27;s owner using guides released by members of the community, with one of the most prominent being &quot;Critter Costuming&quot;, a 2004 manual by Adam Riggs. However, by the mid-2000s, the demand for high-quality fursuits was high enough that fursuit making became a viable business. Furries began to commission specialized makers with their custom designs or open-ended requests. Including used suits, the industry now sells millions of dollars worth of suits each year, and organizations such as sports teams are increasingly commissioning custom-made fursuits for their mascots.

According to Forbes in 2018, a few fursuit makers in recent years have gained a larger audience by making mascots for mainstream organizations.

== Fursuit construction ==
Fursuits originated due to the dissatisfaction with the quality of mass-produced mascot costumes. Fursuit making is a growing industry, with new costume makers who handcraft custom suits entering the market every week. A few dozen of these makers are highly respected and command prices up to $4,500 or more for a full suit, while there are several hundred more who charge less, usually between $600 and $1,000. Some of these, however, are &quot;fly-by-night&quot; operations or make suits of sub-par quality, leading to the proliferation of fursuit review sites to weed them out. There is heavy turnover of these smaller makers, with only a third of them able to stay afloat, due to suit-making being labor-intensive, and requiring a unique style and a following. People also sometimes make fursuits from scratch as a hobby without opening a business themselves.

To have a fursuit fit correctly, many fursuit makers want a &quot;duct tape dummy&quot; to be made, which will measure and represent the wearer&#x27;s body during the construction process. Fursuits are often made with faux fur that may be sourced from places like the Los Angeles Fashion District. A single suit can take more than 200 hours of work and sell for thousands of dollars.

Fursuits can be expensive to clean, although many modern-day suits are machine-washable.

== Types of fursuits ==
Besides the typical full-body suit, the partial suit, where the suit&#x27;s body is substituted by normal clothing, is a popular variation. Three-quarter suits only include part of the body, like the torso or legs, appearing similarly to a funny animal character. Quadsuits are one of the most challenging and expensive types of costumes to make, and involve the wearer walking on all fours with arm extensions to create the illusion of a real animal. A plush suit is a suit that is made to look like a stuffed animal/plushie. There are also fursuits made of other materials, such as spandex or latex.

Fursuits can range from cartoon-styled to hyper-realistic. The most popular animals for fursuits to be based on are dogs and big cats. They may also be based on fictional animal hybrids. Some suits may include integrated technology, such as LED lights and programmed expressive eyes.

== In culture ==

Fursuits are heavily associated with the furry fandom by the general public, despite the fact that only about 15 percent of furries own a fursuit, mainly due to their cost being prohibitively high. 

They may also be seen as overtly sexualized due to negative coverage from shows like &quot;&quot;, though this is typically not the case. However, according to a 2019 study, only 8.8% of furries had a fetish for fursuits. Researcher Courtney Plante stated in 2015 the vast majority of furries &quot;don&#x27;t want to hear about sex in fursuits, and while they might not reject you, they don&#x27;t want to know.&quot;

Furries who own a fursuit often base them on a &quot;fursona&quot;, an anthropomorphic character that represents themselves. Dedicated fursuiters may own as many as a dozen suits based on different characters. Despite being stereotyped as &quot;basement dwellers&quot; still living at home with their parents by many outside the subculture, many members of the furry fandom aspire to be society&#x27;s highest earners, in part to afford expensive fursuits and associated furry art.

Fursuits are usually worn to furry conventions such as Midwest FurFest and Anthrocon. Some fursuits of existing characters are made for the purposes of cosplay and are worn to anime or gaming conventions. They are also worn in public, though this often requires a spotter or handler to ensure the safety of the performer from things like rowdy people, exhaustion or accidents due to limited vision.

Esports champion SonicFox became notable in the gaming community for participating in and winning fighting game tournaments while wearing a partial fursuit of their fursona created by fursuit maker Yamishizen. They later ordered two new full suits from the same maker.

<doc id="581326" wikidata="Q506894" url="?curid=581326" title="Littoral zone">
<text>The littoral zone, also called litoral or nearshore, is the part of a sea, lake, or river that is close to the shore. In coastal ecology, the littoral zone includes the intertidal zone extending from the high water mark (which is rarely inundated), to coastal areas that are permanently submerged — known as the &quot;foreshore&quot; — and the terms are often used interchangeably. However, the geographical meaning of &quot;littoral zone&quot; extends well beyond the intertidal zone to include all neritic waters within the bounds of continental shelves.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;littoral&quot; may be used both as a noun and as an adjective. It derives from the Latin noun &quot;litus, litoris&quot;, meaning &quot;shore&quot;. (The doubled &quot;t&quot; is a late-medieval innovation, and the word is sometimes seen in the more classical-looking spelling &quot;litoral&quot;.)

==Description==
The term has no single definition. What is regarded as the full extent of the littoral zone, and the way the littoral zone is divided into subregions, varies in different contexts. For lakes, the littoral zone is the nearshore habitat where photosynthetically active radiation penetrates to the lake bottom in sufficient quantities to support photosynthesis. The use of the term also varies from one part of the world to another, and between different disciplines. For example, military commanders speak of the littoral in ways that are quite different from the definition used by marine biologists.

The adjacency of water gives a number of distinctive characteristics to littoral regions. The erosive power of water results in particular types of landforms, such as sand dunes, and estuaries. The natural movement of the littoral along the coast is called the littoral drift. Biologically, the ready availability of water enables a greater variety of plant and animal life, and particularly the formation of extensive wetlands. In addition, the additional local humidity due to evaporation usually creates a microclimate supporting unique types of organisms.

==In oceanography and marine biology==


In oceanography and marine biology, the idea of the littoral zone is extended roughly to the edge of the continental shelf. Starting from the shoreline, the littoral zone begins at the spray region just above the high tide mark. From here, it moves to the intertidal region between the high and low water marks, and then out as far as the edge of the continental shelf. These three subregions are called, in order, the supralittoral zone, the eulittoral zone, and the sublittoral zone.

===Supralittoral zone===
The &quot;supralittoral zone&quot; (also called the &quot;splash&quot;, &quot;spray&quot; or &quot;supratidal zone&quot;) is the area above the spring high tide line that is regularly splashed, but not submerged by ocean water. Seawater penetrates these elevated areas only during storms with high tides. Organisms that live here must cope with exposure to fresh water from rain, cold, heat, dryness and predation by land animals and seabirds. At the top of this area, patches of dark lichens can appear as crusts on rocks. Some types of periwinkles, Neritidae and detritus feeding Isopoda commonly inhabit the lower supralittoral.

===Eulittoral zone===
The &quot;eulittoral zone&quot; (also called the &quot;midlittoral&quot; or &quot;mediolittoral zone&quot;) is the &quot;intertidal zone&quot;, known also as the &quot;foreshore&quot;. It extends from the spring high tide line, which is rarely inundated, to the spring low tide line, which is rarely not inundated. It is alternately exposed and submerged once or twice daily. Organisms living here must be able to withstand the varying conditions of temperature, light, and salinity. Despite this, productivity is high in this zone. The wave action and turbulence of recurring tides shape and reform cliffs, gaps and caves, offering a huge range of habitats for sedentary organisms. Protected rocky shorelines usually show a narrow, almost homogenous, eulittoral strip, often marked by the presence of barnacles. Exposed sites show a wider extension and are often divided into further zones. For more on this, see intertidal ecology.

===Sublittoral zone===
The &quot;sublittoral zone&quot; starts immediately below the eulittoral zone. This zone is permanently covered with seawater and is approximately equivalent to the neritic zone.

In physical oceanography, the sublittoral zone refers to coastal regions with significant tidal flows and energy dissipation, including non-linear flows, internal waves, river outflows and oceanic fronts. In practice, this typically extends to the edge of the continental shelf, with depths around 200 meters.

In marine biology, the sublittoral zone refers to the areas where sunlight reaches the ocean floor, that is, where the water is never so deep as to take it out of the photic zone. This results in high primary production and makes the sublittoral zone the location of the majority of sea life. As in physical oceanography, this zone typically extends to the edge of the continental shelf. The benthic zone in the sublittoral is much more stable than in the intertidal zone; temperature, water pressure, and the amount of sunlight remain fairly constant. Sublittoral corals do not have to deal with as much change as intertidal corals. Corals can live in both zones, but they are more common in the sublittoral zone.

Within the sublittoral, marine biologists also identify the following:
*The infralittoral zone is the algal dominated zone, which may extend to five metres below the low water mark.
*The circalittoral zone is the region beyond the infralittoral, that is, below the algal zone and dominated by sessile animals such as mussels and oysters.

Shallower regions of the sublittoral zone, extending not far from the shore, are sometimes referred to as the subtidal zone.

== Habitats in littoral zones ==
Many vertebrates (e.g., mammals, waterfowl, reptiles) and invertebrates (insects, etc.) use both the littoral zone as well as the terrestrial ecosystem for food and habitat. Biota that are commonly assumed to reside in the pelagic zone often rely heavily on resources from the littoral zone. Littoral areas of ponds and lakes are typically better oxygenated, structurally more complex, and afford more abundant and diverse food resources than do profundal sediments. All these factors lead to a high diversity of insects and very complex trophic interactions.

The great lakes of the world represent a global heritage of surface freshwater and aquatic biodiversity. Species lists for 14 of the world&#x27;s largest lakes reveal that 15% of the global diversity (the total number of species) of freshwater fishes, 9% of non-insect freshwater invertebrate diversity, and 2% of aquatic insect diversity live in this handful of lakes. The vast majority (more than 93%) of species inhabit the shallow, nearshore littoral zone, and 72% are completely restricted to the littoral zone, even though littoral habitats are a small fraction of total lake areas.

Because the littoral zone is important for many recreational and industrial purposes, it is often severely affected by many human activities that increase nutrient loading, spread invasive species, cause acidification and climate change, and produce increased fluctuations in water level. Littoral zones are both more negatively affected by human activity and less intensively studied than offshore waters. Conservation of the remarkable biodiversity and biotic integrity of large lakes will require better integration of littoral zones into our understanding of lake ecosystem functioning and focused efforts to alleviate human impacts along the shoreline.

==In freshwater ecosystems==

In freshwater situations, the littoral zone is the nearshore habitat where photosynthetically active radiation penetrates to the lake bottom in sufficient quantities to support photosynthesis. Sometimes other definitions are used. For example, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources defines littoral as that portion of the lake that is less than 15 feet in depth. Such fixed-depth definitions often do not accurately represent the true ecological zonation, but are sometimes used because they are simple measurements to make bathymetric maps or when there are no measurements of light penetration. The littoral zone comprises an estimated 78% of Earth&#x27;s total lake area.

The littoral zone may form a narrow or broad fringing wetland, with extensive areas of aquatic plants sorted by their tolerance to different water depths. Typically, four zones are recognized, from higher to lower on the shore: wooded wetland, wet meadow, marsh and aquatic vegetation. The relative areas of these four types depends not only on the profile of the shoreline, but upon past water levels. The area of wet meadow is particularly dependent upon past water levels; in general, the area of wet meadows along lakes and rivers increases with natural water level fluctuations. Many of the animals in lakes and rivers are dependent upon the wetlands of littoral zones, since the rooted plants provide habitat and food. Hence, a large and productive littoral zone is considered an important characteristic of a healthy lake or river.

Littoral zones are at particular risk for two reasons. First, human settlement is often attracted to shorelines, and settlement often disrupts breeding habitats for littoral zone species. For example, many turtles are killed on roads when they leave the water to lay their eggs in upland sites. Fish can be negatively affected by docks and retaining walls which remove breeding habitat in shallow water. Some shoreline communities even deliberately try to remove wetlands since they may interfere with activities like swimming. Overall, the presence of human settlement has a demonstrated negative impact upon adjoining wetlands. An equally serious problem is the tendency to stabilize lake or river levels with dams. Dams removed the spring flood, which carries nutrients into littoral zones and reduces the natural fluctuation of water levels upon which many wetland plants and animals depend. Hence, over time, dams can reduce the area of wetland from a broad littoral zone to a narrow band of vegetation. Marshes and wet meadows are at particular risk.

==Other definitions==
For the purposes of naval operations, the US Navy divides the littoral zone in the ways shown on the diagram at the top of this article. The US Army Corps of Engineers and the US Environmental Protection Agency have their own definitions, which have legal implications.

The UK Ministry of Defence defines the littoral as &quot;those land areas (and their adjacent areas and associated air space) that are susceptible to engagement and influence from the sea&quot;.

<text>Antonia Eugenia Vardalos (; born September 24, 1962) is a Canadian actress and screenwriter. She starred in and wrote the romantic comedy film &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; (2002), which garnered her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and which went on to spawn a media franchise.

==Early life==
Vardalos was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on September 24, 1962. She is the daughter of Greek-Canadian parents Doreen Christakos, a bookkeeper and homemaker, and Constantine &quot;Gus&quot; Vardalos, a land developer who was born in Kalavryta. She attended St. George School and Shaftesbury High School in Winnipeg and Toronto Metropolitan University in Toronto.

==Career==

An alumna of the Chicago-based Second City comedy repertory company, Vardalos wrote and performed in over ten revues of sketch comedy and won Chicago&#x27;s Joseph Jefferson award for Best Actress. Vardalos had many small roles in television shows such as &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; and &quot;Two Guys and a Girl;&quot; in addition, she provided voices for the 1996 radio adaptation of &quot;Star Wars: Return of the Jedi&quot; which Brian Daley had written for National Public Radio.

She gained fame with her movie about a woman&#x27;s struggle to find love in &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding.&quot; First performed as a one-woman show of the same name, the film was a critical and commercial success. The film earned Vardalos an Academy Award Nomination for Best Writing, a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a Screen Actors Guild Award Nomination.

The sleeper hit quickly became one of the highest-grossing independent films of all time, and the number one romantic comedy of all time. Vardalos hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the fall of 2002.

The next film she starred in, which she also wrote, and in which she also sang and danced, was &quot;Connie and Carla,&quot; released in 2004; this became a cult-hit musical , and is about two women pretending to be drag queens. (The plot has been compared to that of &quot;Some Like It Hot,&quot; the 1959 American romantic comedy film by Billy Wilder, in that the female leads of &quot;Connie And Carla&quot; were hiding from criminals whose crimes they had witnessed and who could still kill both of them had they been found.)

Vardalos made her directorial debut in 2009 with the independent feature &quot;I Hate Valentine&#x27;s Day.&quot; The film, about a florist finding romance, was made for less than $400,000 and grossed $1,985,260 on a limited release at the international box-office. This was followed by &quot;My Life in Ruins,&quot; about a misguided tour-guide traveling around Greece and featuring Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss. The film was the first American production given permission to film at the Acropolis of Athens; Vardalos personally sought the approval from the Greek government and credits her years of Greek School for helping her be fluent in the language.

In 2011, Vardalos collaborated with Tom Hanks to write the romantic comedy film &quot;Larry Crowne&quot; for the screen, which grossed $59.8 million; Vardalos also voiced the character Map Genie in the film.

In 2016, Vardalos adapted Cheryl Strayed&#x27;s beloved book, &quot;Tiny Beautiful Things,&quot; and starred in the sold out run of the play at The Public Theater in New York, directed by Thomas Kail. Vardalos reprised her role in 2017 at The Public, and again at the Pasadena Playhouse in California.

Vardalos joined many celebrities helping to produce The 1 Second Film art project; she herself was featured in &quot;The Dialogue,&quot; an interview series. In this 90 minute interview with producer Mike DeLuca, Vardalos talked about how her experiences in The Second City comedy troupe helped her as an actress and a screenwriter, and how the unofficial &quot;tell-the-Greek&quot; word-of-mouth program had a hand in catapulting her movie to such great heights. She sang The Beatles song &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; on the 2006 charity album &quot;Unexpected Dreams – Songs from the Stars.&quot;

Vardalos starred in and wrote &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2,&quot; which was released in March 2016. It earned over $60 million domestically from an $18 million budget.

From 2015 to 2017, Vardalos and Gomez co-presented the first two seasons of &quot;The Great American Baking Show,&quot; formerly known as &quot;The Great Holiday Baking Show,&quot; for ABC-TV.

In 2018, Vardalos guest-starred in an episode of The CW series &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.&quot;

In 2019, Vardalos played Faye Anderson in the ABC television holiday film &quot;Same Time, Next Christmas.&quot; In 2020, in what was, for her, a rare turn to both serious, non-comedy acting and impostures of real people, she impersonated convicted poisoner Stacey Castor in the made-for-television movie &quot;Poisoned Love: The Stacey Castor Story,&quot; which Lifetime Television transmitted.

In September 2022, Vardalos, along with comedian Rob Riggle, created, wrote, and starred in the 10 episode comedy podcast &quot;Motivated!&quot; for Audible Original and Broadway Video.

In 2023, Vardalos reprised her role as Toula Portakalos in &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3&quot; in which she served as director and screenwriter. That same year, she guest starred in the midseason finale of the first part of season three of the television series &quot;Chucky&quot; as Evelyn Elliot, a fellow death row inmate in Texas.

==Personal life==
In September 1993, Vardalos married American actor Ian Gomez. After trying for nine years to conceive through IVF and surrogacy, Vardalos and Gomez adopted their daughter in 2008. At the time she was three years old and part of the foster care system. In 2013, Vardalos wrote a book about the experience, a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller she titled &quot;Instant Mom&quot;, and she donates all the proceeds from its royalties to adoption groups. Vardalos also posted an advice column about the adoption process in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

On July 3, 2018, it was announced that Vardalos had filed for divorce from Gomez after 25 years of marriage, and that they had already been separated since June 2017. The divorce was finalized two months later.

<doc id="581328" wikidata="Q3133041" url="?curid=581328" title="Henry Emmerson">
<text>Henry Robert Emmerson, (September 25, 1853 – July 9, 1914) was a Canadian lawyer, businessman, politician, and philanthropist who served as Premier of New Brunswick from 1897 to 1900.

Henry Emmerson was educated at Amherst Academy, Mount Allison Academy, St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Acadia College and earned a law degree from Boston University. He went on to a lucrative law practice and was heavily involved in business. He was involved in woollen manufacturing, was a director of the Maritime Baptist Publishing Company Limited, president of the New Brunswick Petroleum Company Limited, the Acadia Coal and Coke Company, and the Sterling Coal Company, as well as a director of the Record Foundry and Machine Company.

He attempted to win a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in 1887 but was unsuccessful. The next year he was elected to the provincial legislature then after the win was contested by his opponent and a new election contest ordered in 1889, Emmerson won the seat. In 1891 he was appointed to the Legislative Council of the province and oversaw its abolition. He re-entered the House of Assembly and in October 1892 was appointed to the Executive Council, serving as Chief Commissioner of Public Works in the Liberal government of Premier Andrew George Blair.

As commissioner, Emmerson stopped the practice of building bridges out of wood and opted for more permanent, and more expensive, materials thus driving up the province&#x27;s public debt. He also supported women&#x27;s suffrage.

Emmerson became Premier in 1897. During his tenure, he briefly held the position of Attorney-General. His government tried to promote tourism and wheat farming and the development of natural gas and petroleum in the province. In 1899, he introduced legislation to grant women the right to vote but in a free vote, the bill was defeated.

Emmerson left provincial politics in 1900 to become a Liberal MP in the House of Commons of Canada. From 1904 to 1907 he was Minister of Railways and Canals in the federal cabinet of Sir Wilfrid Laurier.

Although he was regarded as brilliant, capable, and personable, his alcoholism and reputation as a womanizer hampered his career. In 1906, an exasperated Laurier had Emmerson sign a pledge that he would &quot;never . . . again taste wine, beer or any other mixed or intoxicating liquor&quot; and that he would provide the prime minister with an undated and signed letter of resignation to be used should he fail in his promise. The letter of resignation was invoked in 1907 after The Daily Gleaner newspaper reported that Emmerson was thrown out of a Montreal hotel with &quot;two women of ill repute&quot;. He denied the allegations but on April 1 submitted his resignation from Cabinet, which Laurier accepted. Emmerson filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the &quot;Daily Gleaner&quot; for defamation and libel.

Henry Emerson remained a member of parliament for another seven years until his death in 1914.
In his later years, Emmerson donated the money to build a new library, named Emmerson Hall, at Acadia University in honour of his father, the Rev. Robert Henry Emmerson.

His son, Henry Read Emmerson, was also elected to the Canadian House of Commons and was appointed to the Senate of Canada. His great great grandson was Chris Cornell, lead singer of Soundgarden. His great great great grandson is professional ice hockey player Noah Dobson.

<text>Comrat (, ; , ) is a city and municipality in Moldova and the capital of the autonomous region of Gagauzia. It is located in the south of the country, on the Ialpug River. In 2014, Comrat&#x27;s population was 20,113, of which the vast majority are Gagauzians.

== History ==

Comrat was first settled as early as 1443, with other sources claiming it was founded in 1789. Nevertheless, the settlement was sparsely populated until the new Russian government issued a decree in 1819 to resettle the region with Bulgarians and other nationalities from across the Danube, after the territory was annexed by Russia from Moldavia in 1812.

In 1906, the village revolted against the Russian authorities and proclaimed the autonomous (but not independent) Comrat Republic. Following World War I, it was part of Kingdom of Romania. During World War II, it was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, before it was recaptured by Romania in 1941.

During the time when the town was part of Moldavian SSR, Comrat&#x27;s industry was geared toward the production of butter, wine, and rugs, the latter decorated with Moldavian motifs. The Comrat State University was established in 2002.

==Demographics==
According to the 2014 census, the population of Comrat amounted to 20,113 inhabitants (making it the tenth largest city in Moldova), a decrease compared to the previous census in 2004, when 23,327 inhabitants were registered. Of these, 9,528 were men and 10,585 were women.


&quot;Footnotes&quot;:

* &quot;There is an ongoing controversy regarding the ethnic identification of Moldovans and Romanians.&quot;

* &quot;Moldovan language is one of the two local names for the Romanian language in Moldova. In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova interpreted that Article 13 of the constitution is superseded by the Declaration of Independence, thus giving official status to the name &quot;Romanian&quot;.&quot;

<text>Lemuel John Tweedie (November 30, 1849 – July 15, 1917) was a Canadian politician.

His law partner in Chatham, New Brunswick for a time was Richard Bedford Bennett, later Prime Minister of Canada; and for a time Max Aitken was his office boy.

A former supporter of the federal Conservatives, he joined the Liberal Cabinet of New Brunswick Premier Andrew George Blair serving as Surveyor-General and Provincial Secretary in successive Liberal governments. Tweedie became the tenth premier of New Brunswick in 1900 and led the party to a large majority government in the 1903 election.

Tweedie&#x27;s government allowed women to be admitted to the practice of law in 1906 and supported the development of hydroelectric power at Grand Falls. He also created a Workers&#x27; Compensation board and successfully lobbied the federal government to increase subsidies to the province including payment for railway expansion. He led the government for seven years before becoming the 12th Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, holding that position until 1912.

A supporter of educational institutions, Tweedie personally donated academic prizes for students. He served on the Board of Governors of the University of New Brunswick, Mount Allison University, plus the Halifax School for the Blind.

Lemuel Tweedie died in 1917 at age sixty-seven in his home town of Chatham and was buried in the Riverside Cemetery. His son Frederick served as a member of the provincial assembly.

<text>The Media Fund is a 527 group, active in U.S. politics, which supported Democrat John Kerry&#x27;s campaign for President. It was formed in 2002, and is led by Harold M. Ickes, a former aide to President Bill Clinton. Its chief fundraiser is Ellen Malcolm, a former fundraiser for EMILY&#x27;s List. Billionaire George Soros was among the largest donors to the Fund. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the Media Fund raised $45 million to run issue ads in key swing states. The Media Fund is one of several 527 groups which supported Kerry; others include America Coming Together and MoveOn.org. After the election, the group experienced a dramatic drop in fundraising success; media reports speculated that major donors had given up on the organization, and were turning their attention to other, more long-term Democratic projects.

==Legal issues==

The group was fined by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in 2007. The $580,000 fine—the seventh highest the FEC had levied—resulted from a settlement between the fund and the regulator. Groups including the Republican National Committee and Bush&#x27;s reelection team had complained to the FEC about election law violations. The FEC found that the Media Fund had improperly accepted contributions from unions and corporations as well as contributions from individuals over the $5,000 cap. According to a spokesperson, Media Fund did not admit to any wrongdoing in its settlement.

<doc id="581358" wikidata="Q1811480" url="?curid=581358" title="Family values">
<text>Family values, sometimes referred to as familial values, are traditional or cultural values that pertain to the family&#x27;s structure, function, roles, beliefs, attitudes, and ideals. Additionally, the concept of family values may be understood as a reflection of the degree to which familial relationships are valued within an individual&#x27;s life.

In the social sciences and U.S. political discourse, the conventional term &quot;traditional family&quot; describes the nuclear family—a child-rearing environment composed of a leading father, a homemaking mother, and their nominally biological children. A family deviating from this model is considered a nontraditional family.

==Definition==
Several online dictionaries define &quot;family values&quot; as the following:
* &quot;the moral and ethical principles traditionally upheld and passed on within a family, as fidelity, honesty, truth, and faith.&quot;
* &quot;values especially of a traditional or conservative kind which are held to promote the sound functioning of the family and to strengthen the fabric of society.&quot;
* &quot;values held to be traditionally taught or reinforced within a family, such as those of high moral standards and discipline.&quot;

==In politics==

Familialism or &quot;familism&quot; is the ideology that puts priority on family and family values. Familialism advocates for a welfare system where families, rather than the government, take responsibility for the care of their members.

In the United States, the banner of &quot;family values&quot; has been used by social conservatives to express opposition to abortion, pornography, non-abstinence sex education, divorce, LGBTQ validity, same-sex marriage, gender diversity, secularism, and atheism. American conservative groups have made successful inroads promoting these policies in Africa since the early 2000s, describing them as African family values. 

The phrase &quot;family values&quot; originated with the 1992 Republican National Convention, for their &quot;Family Values Night&quot;, featuring Barbara Bush as the keynote speaker. In the short term the phrase was widely panned, and at the time the staying power of the idea was underestimated. 

==Family values by region==

===Arabic culture===
Interpretations of Islamic learnings and Arab culture are common for the majority of Saudis. Islam is a driving cultural force that dictates a submission to the will of Allah. The academic literature suggests that the family is regarded as the main foundation of Muslim society and culture; the family structure and nature of the relationship between family members are influenced by the Islamic religion. Marriage in Saudi culture means the union of two families, not just two individuals. In Muslim society, marriage involves a social contract that occurs with the consent of parents or guardians. Furthermore, marriage is considered the only legitimate outlet for sexual desires, and sex outside marriage (zina) is a crime that is punished under Islamic law.

The Saudi family includes extended families, as the extended family provides the individual with a sense of identity. The father is often the breadwinner and protector of the family, whereas the mother is often the homemaker and the primary caretaker of the children. Parents are regarded with high respect, and children are strongly encouraged to respect and obey their parents. Often, families provide care for elders. Until recently, because families and friends are expected to provide elderly care, nursing homes were considered culturally unacceptable.

===United States culture===

In sociological terms, nontraditional families make up the majority of American households. As of 2014, only 46% of children in the U.S. live in a traditional family, down from 61% in 1980. This number includes only families with parents who are in their first marriage, whereas the percentage of children simply living with two married parents is 65% as of 2016.

====Organizations====
These groups are associated with &quot;family values&quot;. Many of them are also listed as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a result of their anti-LGBT activism.

<doc id="581365" wikidata="Q1247231" url="?curid=581365" title="Oneida Lake">
<text>Oneida Lake is the largest lake entirely within New York state, with a surface area of .
The lake is located northeast of Syracuse and near the Great Lakes. It feeds the Oneida River, a tributary of the Oswego River, which flows into Lake Ontario. From the earliest times until the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, the lake was part of an important waterway connecting the Atlantic seaboard of North America to the continental interior.

The lake is about long and about wide with an average depth of . The shoreline is about . Portions of six counties and 69 communities are in the watershed. Oneida Creek, which flows past the cities of Oneida and Sherrill, empties into the southeast part of the lake, at South Bay. While not geologically considered one of the Finger Lakes, Oneida Lake, because of its proximity, is referred by some as their &quot;thumb&quot;. Because it is shallow, it is warmer than the deeper Finger Lakes in summer and its surface freezes solidly in winter. It is popular for the winter sports of ice fishing and snowmobiling.

==Name==

The lake is named for the Oneida, the Iroquoian Native American tribe that historically occupied a large region around the lake, one of the Six Nations of the Iroquois. The name Oneida comes from the word &quot;Oneyoteaka&quot;, their endonym which translates to &quot;People of the Standing Stone&quot;. The Oneida called the lake &quot;Tsioqui&quot; in their language, meaning &quot;White Water&quot;.

==History of navigation==
During the 18th and early 19th centuries Oneida Lake and its tributary Wood Creek were part of the Albany-Oswego waterway from the Atlantic seaboard westward via the Hudson River and through the Appalachian Mountains via the Mohawk River; travel westward then was by portage over the Oneida Carry to the Wood Creek-Oneida Lake system. The navigable waterway exited Oneida Lake by the Oneida River, which led to the Oswego River and Lake Ontario, from where travelers could reach the other Great Lakes.

Following the American Revolutionary War, the United States forced the Iroquois nations to cede most of their lands in that region, as most of them had allied with the British, who were defeated. In addition, demand from settlers created pressure for such cessions. White settlers improved the natural waterway by constructing a canal with locks within Wood Creek to Oneida Lake. This system was significantly improved—from 1792 to 1803—by cutting a canal across the Oneida Carry, after which commercial shipping across Oneida Lake increased substantially.
 Even more significant was the completion in 1825 of the Erie Canal, which bypassed the Oneida Lake system and enhanced travel through the entire Mohawk Valley. This caused the population around the lake to lose their navigable waterway eastward.

In 1835 Oneida Lake was connected to the Erie Canal system by construction of the (old) Oneida Canal, which ran about from Higginsville on the Erie Canal northward to Wood Creek, about upstream of Oneida Lake. Built poorly with wooden locks, the Oneida Canal was closed in 1863.

When the Erie Canal was redesigned and reconstructed to form the New York State Barge Canal in the early 20th century, the engineers made use of natural rivers and lakes where possible. The new barges were powered internally (by diesel or steam engines), so they could travel open water and against a current; the system no longer needed infrastructure for drawing vessels externally — i.e., drawpaths and draft animals. After it straightened Fish Creek on the east, the new canalway entered Oneida Lake at Sylvan Beach and exited west with the Oneida River at Brewerton. New terminal walls at Sylvan Beach, Cleveland, and Brewerton allowed barges to load and unload cargo and to stay overnight. A new break wall was installed, preventing lake waves from entering the canal and protecting against shoaling. These improvements provided towns along the shoreline of Oneida Lake with access again to navigable waterways east and west.

==Geology==
Oneida Lake is a remnant of Glacial Lake Iroquois, a large prehistoric lake formed when glaciers blocked (from downstream) the flow of the St. Lawrence River, the outlet of the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.

Oneida Lake is the namesake of Oneida Lacus, a hydrocarbon lake on the Saturnian moon Titan. That &quot;lake&quot; is composed of liquid methane and ethane, and is located at 76.14°N and 131.83°W on Titan&#x27;s globe.

Oneida County, Idaho is also named for the lake.

<text>McPherson Square station is a Washington Metro station in Downtown, Washington, D.C., United States. The side-platformed station is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines, the station is located between McPherson Square and Franklin Square, with two entrances on I Street at Vermont Avenue and 14th Street NW. This is the main station to access the White House, and the Vermont Avenue exit is directly underneath the Department of Veterans Affairs building.

==History==
The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium and the opening of the Arlington Cemetery, Capitol South, Crystal City, Eastern Market, Farragut West, Federal Center SW, Federal Triangle, Foggy Bottom–GWU, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, National Airport, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Potomac Avenue, Rosslyn, Smithsonian, and Stadium–Armory stations. Orange Line service to the station began upon the line&#x27;s opening on November 20, 1978.

Between January 15 to January 21, 2021, this station was closed because of security concerns due to the Inauguration of Joe Biden.

<doc id="581370" wikidata="Q9189959" url="?curid=581370" title="Acyl chloride">
<text>In organic chemistry, an acyl chloride (or acid chloride) is an organic compound with the functional group . Their formula is usually written , where R is a side chain. They are reactive derivatives of carboxylic acids (). A specific example of an acyl chloride is acetyl chloride, . Acyl chlorides are the most important subset of acyl halides.

==Nomenclature==
Where the acyl chloride moiety takes priority, acyl chlorides are named by taking the name of the parent carboxylic acid, and substituting &quot;-yl chloride&quot; for &quot;-ic acid&quot;. Thus:
:
:butyric acid (C3H7COOH) → butyryl chloride (C3H7COCl)
(Idiosyncratically, for some trivial names, &quot;-oyl chloride&quot; substitutes &quot;-ic acid. For example, pivalic acid becomes pivaloyl chloride and acrylic acid becomes acryloyl chloride.&quot; The names pivalyl chloride and acrylyl chloride are less commonly used, although they are arguably more logical.)

When other functional groups take priority, acyl chlorides are considered prefixes — &quot;chlorocarbonyl-&quot;:

==Properties==
Lacking the ability to form hydrogen bonds, acyl chlorides have lower boiling and melting points than similar carboxylic acids. For example, acetic acid boils at 118 °C, whereas acetyl chloride boils at 51 °C. Like most carbonyl compounds, infrared spectroscopy reveals a band near 1750 cm−1.

The simplest stable acyl chloride is acetyl chloride; formyl chloride is not stable at room temperature, although it can be prepared at –60 °C or below. 

Acyl chlorides hydrolyze (react with water) to form the corresponding carboxylic acid and hydrochloric acid:
:&lt;chem&gt;RCOCl + H2O -&gt; RCOOH + HCl&lt;/chem&gt;

==Synthesis==
===Industrial routes===
The industrial route to acetyl chloride involves the reaction of acetic anhydride with hydrogen chloride: 
:&lt;chem&gt;(CH3CO)2O + HCl -&gt; CH3COCl + CH3CO2H&lt;/chem&gt;

Propionyl chloride is produced by chlorination of propionic acid with phosgene:
:&lt;chem&gt;CH3CH2CO2H + COCl2 -&gt; CH3CH2COCl + HCl + CO2&lt;/chem&gt;

Benzoyl chloride is produced by the partial hydrolysis of benzotrichloride:
:&lt;chem&gt;C6H5CCl3 + H2O -&gt; C6H5C(O)Cl + 2 HCl&lt;/chem&gt;

Similarly, benzotrichlorides react with carboxylic acids to the acid chloride. This conversion is practiced for the reaction of 1,4-bis(trichloromethyl)benzene to give terephthaloyl chloride:
:&lt;chem&gt;C6H4(CCl3)2 + C6H4(CO2H)2 -&gt; 2 C6H4(COCl)2 + 2 HCl&lt;/chem&gt;

===Laboratory methods===
====Thionyl chloride==== 
In the laboratory, acyl chlorides are generally prepared by treating carboxylic acids with thionyl chloride (). The reaction is catalyzed by dimethylformamide and other additives.
Thionyl chloride⁠ is a well-suited reagent as the by-products (HCl, ) are gases and residual thionyl chloride can be easily removed as a result of its low boiling point (76 °C).

====Phosphorus chlorides====
Phosphorus trichloride () is popular, although excess reagent is required. Phosphorus pentachloride () is also effective, but only one chloride is transferred:
:&lt;chem&gt;RCO2H + PCl5 -&gt; RCOCl + POCl3 + HCl&lt;/chem&gt;

====Oxalyl chloride====
Another method involves the use of oxalyl chloride:
:&lt;chem&gt;RCO2H + ClCOCOCl -&gt;[DMF] RCOCl + CO + CO2 + HCl&lt;/chem&gt;
The reaction is catalysed by dimethylformamide (DMF), which reacts with oxalyl chloride to give the Vilsmeier reagent, an iminium intermediate that which reacts with the carboxylic acid to form a mixed imino-anhydride. This structure undergoes an acyl substitution with the liberated chloride, forming the acid anhydride and releasing regenerated molecule of DMF. Relative to thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride is more expensive but also a milder reagent and therefore more selective. 

====Other laboratory methods==== 
Acid chlorides can be used as a chloride source. Thus acetyl chloride can be distilled from a mixture of benzoyl chloride and acetic acid:
:&lt;chem&gt;CH3CO2H + C6H5COCl -&gt; CH3COCl + C6H5CO2H&lt;/chem&gt;

Other methods that do not form HCl include the Appel reaction:
:&lt;chem&gt;RCO2H + Ph3P + CCl4 -&gt; RCOCl + Ph3PO + HCCl3&lt;/chem&gt;
Another is the use of cyanuric chloride:
:&lt;chem&gt;RCO2H + C3N3Cl3 -&gt; RCOCl + C3N3Cl2OH&lt;/chem&gt;

==Reactions==
Acyl chloride are reactive, versatile reagents. Acyl chlorides have a greater reactivity than other carboxylic acid derivatives like acid anhydrides, esters or amides:

Acyl chlorides hydrolyze, yielding the carboxylic acid:
This hydrolysis is usually a nuisance rather than intentional. 
===Alcoholysis, aminolysis, and related reactions===
Acid chlorides are useful for the preparation of amides, esters, anhydrides. These reactions generate chloride, which can be undesirable. Acyl chlorides are used to prepare acid anhydrides, amides and esters, by reacting acid chlorides with: a salt of a carboxylic acid, an amine, or an alcohol, respectively.



Acid halides are the most reactive acyl derivatives, and can easily be converted into any of the others. Acid halides will react with carboxylic acids to form anhydrides. If the structure of the acid and the acid chloride are different, the product is a mixed anhydride. First, the carboxylic acid attacks the acid chloride (1) to give tetrahedral intermediate 2. The tetrahedral intermediate collapses, ejecting chloride ion as the leaving group and forming oxonium species 3. Deprotonation gives the mixed anhydride, 4, and an equivalent of HCl.

Alcohols and amines react with acid halides to produce esters and amides, respectively, in a reaction formally known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction. Acid halides hydrolyze in the presence of water to produce carboxylic acids, but this type of reaction is rarely useful, since carboxylic acids are typically used to synthesize acid halides. Most reactions with acid halides are carried out in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base, such as pyridine, to neutralize the hydrohalic acid that is formed as a byproduct.

====Mechanism====
The alcoholysis of acyl halides (the alkoxy-dehalogenation) is believed to proceed via an SN2 mechanism (Scheme 10).⁠ However, the mechanism can also be tetrahedral or SN1 in highly polar solvents⁠ (while the SN2 reaction involves a concerted reaction, the tetrahedral addition-elimination pathway involves a discernible intermediate).

Bases, such as pyridine or &quot;N,N&quot;-dimethylformamide, catalyze acylations. These reagents activate the acyl chloride via a nucleophilic catalysis mechanism. The amine attacks the carbonyl bond and presumably⁠ first forms a transient tetrahedral intermediate, then forms a quaternary acylammonium salt by the displacement of the leaving group. This quaternary acylammonium salt is more susceptible to attack by alcohols or other nucleophiles.

The use of two phases (aqueous for amine, organic for acyl chloride) is called the Schotten-Baumann reaction. This approach is used in the preparation of nylon via the so-called &quot;nylon rope trick&quot;.⁠

===Reactions with carbanions===
Acid halides react with carbon nucleophiles, such as Grignards and enolates, although mixtures of products can result. While a carbon nucleophile will react with the acid halide first to produce a ketone, the ketone is also susceptible to nucleophilic attack, and can be converted to a tertiary alcohol. For example, when benzoyl chloride (1) is treated with two equivalents of a Grignard reagent, such as methyl magnesium bromide (MeMgBr), 2-phenyl-2-propanol (3) is obtained in excellent yield. Although acetophenone (2) is an intermediate in this reaction, it is impossible to isolate because it reacts with a second equivalent of MeMgBr rapidly after being formed.

 Unlike most other carbon nucleophiles, lithium dialkylcuprates – often called Gilman reagents – can add to acid halides just once to give ketones. The reaction between an acid halide and a Gilman reagent is not a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction, however, and is thought to proceed via a radical pathway. The Weinreb ketone synthesis can also be used to convert acid halides to ketones. In this reaction, the acid halide is first converted to an N–methoxy–N–methylamide, known as a Weinreb amide. When a carbon nucleophile – such as a Grignard or organolithium reagent – adds to a Weinreb amide, the metal is chelated by the carbonyl and N–methoxy oxygens, preventing further nucleophilic additions.

Carbon nucleophiles such as Grignard reagents, convert acyl chlorides to ketones, which in turn are susceptible to the attack by second equivalent to yield the tertiary alcohol. The reaction of acyl halides with certain organocadmium reagents stops at the ketone stage. The reaction with Gilman reagents also afford ketones, reflecting the low nucleophilicity of these lithium diorganocopper compounds.

===Reduction===
Acyl chlorides are reduced by lithium aluminium hydride and diisobutylaluminium hydride to give primary alcohols. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminium hydride, a bulky hydride donor, reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes, as does the Rosenmund reduction using hydrogen gas over a poisoned palladium catalyst.
===Acylation of arenes===
In the Friedel–Crafts acylation, acid halides act as electrophiles for electrophilic aromatic substitution. A Lewis acid – such as zinc chloride (ZnCl2), iron(III) chloride (FeCl3), or aluminum chloride (AlCl3) – coordinates to the halogen on the acid halide, activating the compound towards nucleophilic attack by an activated aromatic ring. For especially electron-rich aromatic rings, the reaction will proceed without a Lewis acid.
Because of the harsh conditions and the reactivity of the intermediates, this otherwise quite useful reaction tends to be messy, as well as environmentally unfriendly.

===Oxidative addition===
Acyl chlorides react with low-valent metal centers to give transition metal acyl complexes. Illustrative is the oxidative addition of acetyl chloride to Vaska&#x27;s complex, converting square planar Ir(I) to octahedral Ir(III):
:&lt;chem&gt;IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2 + CH3COCl -&gt; CH3COIrCl2(CO)(PPh3)2&lt;/chem&gt;

==Hazards==
Low molecular weight acyl chlorides are often lachrymators, and they react violently with water, alcohols, and amines.

<text>The Exarchate of Ravenna (; ), also known as the Exarchate of Italy, was an administrative district of the Byzantine Empire comprising, between the 6th and 8th centuries, the territories under the jurisdiction of the exarch of Italy (&quot;exarchus Italiae&quot;) resident in Ravenna. The term is used in historiography in a double sense: &quot;exarchate&quot; in the strict sense denotes the territory under the direct jurisdiction of the exarch, i.e. the area of the capital Ravenna, but the term is mainly used to designate all the Byzantine territories in continental and peninsular Italy. According to the legal sources of the time, these territories constituted the so-called &quot;Provincia Italiae&quot;, on the basis of the fact that they too, until at least the end of the 7th century, fell under the jurisdiction of the exarch and were governed by &quot;duces&quot; or &quot;magistri militum&quot; under him.

The exarchate was established around 584, the year in which the presence of an exarch in Ravenna is attested for the first time, as a consequence of the perpetual state of war with the Lombards (who in the meantime had stolen approximately two thirds of the Byzantines of continental and peninsular Italy), which necessarily entailed the militarization of Byzantine Italy. The necessities of war pushed military commanders to centralize powers, thus depriving the civil authorities which are no longer attested by sources starting from the second half of the 7th century. Thus the separation of civil and military powers introduced by Diocletian and Constantine disappeared. Byzantine Italy was divided into various military districts governed by &quot;duces&quot; or &quot;magistri militum&quot; dependent on the exarch of Italy, the military governor with full powers chosen by the emperor from among his generals or trusted officials to govern and defend the remaining territories italics. These districts gradually evolved into increasingly autonomous duchies.

Starting from the second half of the 7th century, the autonomist tendencies of the local aristocracies and the ever-increasing temporal political role of the Church of Rome led to a progressive weakening of imperial authority in Italy. Byzantine Italy had now fragmented into a series of autonomous duchies outside the effective control of the exarch, whose authority no longer extended beyond the Ravenna area. Fiscal and religious conflicts between the Papacy and Byzantium accelerated the disintegration of the exarchate. The armies, recruited from the local population, tended to take the pontiff&#x27;s defense, and did not hesitate to turn on the exarch if he plotted against the Papacy. The Lombards took advantage of this to extend their conquests in an attempt to unify Italy under their domination. The exarchate fell in 751 with the Lombard conquest of Ravenna at the hands of the Lombard king Aistulf.

==Introduction==

In 395 Theodosius I bequeathed the throne of the Roman Empire to his two sons: Arcadius was Emperor of the East; Honorius became Western Roman Emperor. The Roman Empire would never return to a single ruler.

The Prefecture of Italy suffered the invasion of barbarians in the 5th century: the first to cross the Alps was Alaric, king of the Visigoths. He arrived in Aquileia in 401 and from there headed for Milan, which he besieged the following year. Honorius, no longer feeling safe, moved to Ravenna and established the new capital of the Western Empire there.

In 476 Ravenna fell due to a military coup d&#x27;état by the general Odoacer who, at the head of a militia of Heruli, Sciri, Rugii and Turcilingi mercenaries (i.e. the Germanic component of the imperial troops), ousted Romulus Augustulus and took possession of the city. The kingdom of Odoacer, the first Roman-barbarian kingdom to exist in Italy, was short-lived: in 493 Odoacer was defeated by the king of the Ostrogoths, Theodoric, who became the new lord of Italy. The new Ostrogothic Kingdom established by Theodoric continued to maintain, as previously, the Roman provincial and state organisation.

Around the middle of the 6th century, Emperor Justinian I launched an impressive series of campaigns for the reconquest of the West and in particular Italy. On the peninsula the emperor began the long and bloody war against the Ostrogoths. In 540 Ravenna, capital of the Goths and seat of the prefecture, was reconquered and the Byzantines began to appoint their own prefects there. The long campaign ended only in 552-554 with the decisive expedition of the general Narses.

On 13 August 554, with the promulgation in Constantinople by Justinian of a &quot;pragmatica sanctio pro petitione Vigilii&quot; (pragmatic sanction on the requests of Pope Vigilius), the Prefecture of Italy returned, although not yet completely pacified, to Roman dominion. However, Sicily and Dalmatia were separated from the Prefecture of Italy: the former did not become part of any prefecture, being governed by a praetor dependent on Constantinople, while the latter was aggregated to the Prefecture of Illyricum. Consequently, at the end of the conflict, the prefecture of Italy, also called &quot;Provincia Italiae&quot; by the Pragmatic Sanction as if to demonstrate a loss of importance, was reduced to only continental and peninsular Italy (Sardinia and Corsica, conquered by the Vandals in the century, after Justinian&#x27;s reconquest they became part of the Praetorian prefecture of Africa).

Narses still remained in Italy with extraordinary powers and also reorganized the defensive, administrative and fiscal apparatus. Four military commands were allocated to defend the prefecture, one in &quot;Forum Iulii&quot;, one in Trento, one in the region of Lake Maggiore and Como and finally one in the Cottian and Graian Alps.

==Lombard invasion and Byzantine reaction ==
In 568, the Lombards under King Alboin, together with other Germanic allies, invaded Northern Italy. The area had only a few years ago been completely pacified, and had suffered greatly during the long Gothic War. The local Byzantine forces were weak and, after taking several towns, in 569 the Lombards conquered Milan. They took Pavia after a three-year siege in 572 and made it their capital. In subsequent years, they took Tuscany. Other military initiatives led by Faroald and Zotto, penetrated into Central and Southern Italy, where they established the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento. However, after Alboin&#x27;s murder in 573, the Lombards fragmented into several autonomous duchies (the &quot;Rule of the Dukes&quot;).

Emperor Justin II tried to take advantage of the Lombardian fragmentation in 576 by sending his son-in-law, Baduarius, to Italy. However, he was defeated and killed in battle, and the continuing crises in the Balkans and the East meant that another imperial effort at reconquest was not possible. Because of the Lombard incursions, the Roman possessions had fragmented into several isolated territories. In 580, Emperor Tiberius II reorganized them into five province &quot;eparchies&quot;: the &quot;Annonaria&quot; in northeastern Italy around Ravenna, Calabria, Campania, Aemilia and the &quot;Urbicaria&quot; around the city of Rome (&quot;Urbs&quot;). What would become the Republic of Venice was at some point created out of part of the exarchy&#x27;s territory. The title of the Doge of Venice included the phrase , marking it as a province of the Byzantine Empire.

By the end of the 6th century the new order of powers had settled into a stable pattern. Ravenna, governed by its exarch, who held civil and military authority in addition to his ecclesiastical office, was confined to the city, its port and environs as far north as the Po (bordering territory of the duke of Venice, nominally in imperial service) and south to the Marecchia River, beyond which lay the Duchy of the Pentapolis on the Adriatic, also under a duke nominally representing the Emperor of the East.

==Exarchate==
The exarchate was organised into a group of duchies (Rome, Venetia, Calabria, Naples, Perugia, Pentapolis, Lucania, etc.) that were mainly the coastal cities in the Italian peninsula since the Lombards held the advantage in the hinterland.

The civil and military head of these imperial possessions, the exarch himself, was the representative at Ravenna of the emperor in Constantinople. The surrounding territory reached from the River Po, which served as the boundary with Venice in the north, to the Pentapolis at Rimini in the south, the border of the &quot;five cities&quot; in the Marches along the Adriatic coast, and reached even cities not on the coast, such as Forlì. All this territory, which lay on the eastern flank of the Apennines, was under the exarch&#x27;s direct administration and formed the Exarchate in the strictest sense. Surrounding territories were governed by dukes and (&quot;masters of the soldiers&quot;) more or less subject to his authority. From the perspective of Constantinople, the Exarchate consisted of the province of Italy.

The Exarchate of Ravenna was not the sole Byzantine province in Italy. Byzantine Sicily formed a separate government, and Corsica and Sardinia, while they remained Byzantine, belonged to the Exarchate of Africa.

The Lombards had their capital at Pavia and controlled the great valley of the Po. The Lombard wedge in Italy spread to the south, and established duchies at Spoleto and Beneventum; they controlled the interior, while Byzantine governors more or less controlled the coasts.

Piedmont, Lombardy, the interior mainland of Venetia, Tuscany and the interior of Campania belonged to the Lombards, and bit by bit the Imperial representative in Italy lost all genuine power, though in name he controlled areas like Liguria (completely lost in 640 to the Lombards), or Naples and Calabria (being overrun by the Lombard duchy of Benevento). In Rome, the pope was the real master.

At the end, 740, the Exarchate consisted of Istria, Venetia, Ferrara, Ravenna (the exarchate in the limited sense), with the Pentapolis, and Perugia.

These fragments of the province of Italy, as it was when reconquered for Justinian, were almost all lost, either to the Lombards, who finally conquered Ravenna itself in 751, or by the revolt of the pope, who finally separated from the Empire on the issue of the iconoclastic reforms.

The relationship between the Pope in Rome and the Exarch in Ravenna was a dynamic that could hurt or help the empire. The Papacy could be a vehicle for local discontent. The old Roman senatorial aristocracy resented being governed by an Exarch who was considered by many a meddlesome foreigner. Thus the exarch faced threats from outside as well as from within, hampering much real progress and development.

In its internal history, the exarchate was subject to the splintering influences that were leading to the subdivision of sovereignty and the establishment of feudalism throughout Europe. Step by step, and in spite of the efforts of the emperors at Constantinople, the great imperial officials became local landowners, the lesser owners of land were increasingly kinsmen or at least associates of these officials, and new allegiances intruded on the sphere of imperial administration. Meanwhile, the necessity for providing for the defence of the imperial territories against the Lombards led to the formation of local militias, who at first were attached to the imperial regiments, but gradually became independent, as they were recruited entirely locally. These armed men formed the , who were the forerunners of the free armed burghers of the Italian cities of the Middle Ages. Other cities of the exarchate were organized on the same model.

==End of the Exarchate==
During the 6th and 7th centuries, the growing menace of the Lombards and the Franks, as well as the split between Eastern and Western Christendom inspired both by iconoclastic emperors and medieval developments in Latin theology and culminating in the acrimonious rivalry between the Pope of Rome and the Patriarch of Constantinople, made the position of the exarch more and more untenable. Ravenna remained the seat of the exarch until the revolt of 727 over iconoclasm. Eutychius, the last exarch of Ravenna, was killed by the Lombards in 751.

In 752, the northeastern portion of the Exarchate known as the &quot;Ducatus Pentapolis&quot; was conquered by King Aistulf of the Lombards. Four years later, after the Franks drove the Lombards out, Pope Stephen II claimed the territory. The Pope&#x27;s ally in the military action against the Lombards, Pepin the Short, King of the Franks, then donated the conquered lands back to the Papacy; this donation, which was confirmed by Pepin&#x27;s son Charlemagne in 774, marked the beginning of the temporal power of the popes as the Patrimony of Saint Peter. The archbishoprics within the former exarchate, however, had developed traditions of local secular power and independence, which contributed to the fragmenting localization of powers. Three centuries later, that independence would fuel the rise of the independent communes.

The southern portions of the exarchate including the imperial possessions at Naples, Calabria, and Apulia were reorganized as the Catepanate of Italy headquartered in Bari. These territories were lost to the Saracen Berbers in 847 but recovered in 871. Later after Sicily was conquered by Arabs the remnants were placed into newly established military/administrative &quot;themes&quot; of Calabria and Langobardia. Istria at the head of the Adriatic was attached to Dalmatia.

<doc id="581374" wikidata="Q3034445" url="?curid=581374" title="2004 Indonesian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Indonesia on 5 July and 20 September 2004. As no candidate won a majority in the first round, a runoff was held, in which Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono defeated Megawati Sukarnoputri and was elected president. They were the first direct presidential elections in the history of Indonesia; prior to a 2002 amendment to the Constitution of Indonesia, both the president and vice president had been elected by the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR).

Under the new amendment, a candidate pair is elected into office after receiving more than 50% of the vote nationally with at least 20% of the vote in more than half of the provinces of Indonesia. If no pair receives the number of votes required, the election will continue into the second round with the pairs receiving the highest and second-highest number of votes. Further regulations set by the General Elections Commission (KPU) state that each pair must be nominated by a political party or coalition of parties which received at least 5% of the popular vote or 3% of the seats to the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) in the April legislative election.

The incumbent, Megawati Sukarnoputri, rose to the presidency following the impeachment of her predecessor, Abdurrahman Wahid, from office. Megawati&#x27;s bid for election was challenged by four candidates, including incumbent vice president Hamzah Haz. In the first round, former cabinet member and retired general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono received a plurality of the valid ballots submitted, followed by Megawati. Yudhoyono eventually defeated Megawati with 60.62% of the valid ballots in the second round. He was inaugurated as the sixth president of Indonesia on 20 October 2004.

==Background==

In the 1999 legislative election, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) won the most number of seats in the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) and became the largest faction in the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR), the legislative body responsible for electing the president of Indonesia. The PDI-P was led by Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Sukarno, Indonesia&#x27;s first president. Megawati&#x27;s supporters had expected her to be elected president by the MPR, but she failed to reach out to parties other than the National Awakening Party (PKB). Her only opponent at the time was President B. J. Habibie, who came into office in May 1998, but he withdrew his candidacy after his accountability speech was rejected by the MPR.

The PKB, which was led by Abdurrahman Wahid, the leader of Indonesia&#x27;s largest Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), had also pledged to support Megawati for president. However, it became clear that Megawati did not have enough votes to back her candidacy. Additionally, National Mandate Party (PAN) leader Amien Rais and his Central Axis (), a coalition of Islamic and reform parties, began pushing for Wahid&#x27;s candidacy. Wahid eventually won the MPR&#x27;s presidential election, and Megawati was elected as vice president. As president, he repealed many of the laws enacted during the Suharto era that discriminated against Chinese Indonesians. Among these was the banning on the use of Chinese characters and display of images relating to Chinese culture. Following this act, many political parties began to reach out to Chinese Indonesians for their votes by displaying Chinese characters on campaign material.

Following Wahid&#x27;s impeachment and removal from office by the MPR in July 2001, the legislative body elevated Megawati to the presidency. She would complete the remainder of Abdurrahman&#x27;s five-year term, ending in October 2004. During its 2002 annual session, the MPR added a series of amendments to the Constitution of Indonesia, including the removal of the military&#x27;s 38 appointed seats in the Assembly, and an amendment for direct election of the president and vice president. This presidential election process would involve political parties nominating a presidential and vice-presidential ticket with the option of a runoff election.

==Candidates==

In December 2003, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) began a tracking survey in order to assess the popularity of potential candidates. The survey continued until the start of the first election round on 5 July and included thirteen possible candidates for president. The first IFES survey indicated that incumbent President Megawati Sukarnoputri received a plurality of the votes. However, by the time of the April 2004 legislative election, retired General Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had taken the lead from Megawati after resigning from her cabinet in March. Other potential candidates included DPR Speaker Akbar Tanjung and Yogyakarta Sultan Hamengkubuwana X.

The results of the legislative election determined which political parties were eligible to submit presidential tickets. Only parties which received at least 5% of the popular vote or 3% of seats (17 of 550 seats) in the DPR would be allowed to submit candidates. Parties that did not meet these criteria must join with other parties to meet at least one criterion. Seven political parties met these criteria: Golkar, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), the National Awakening Party (PKB), the United Development Party (PPP), the Democratic Party (PD), the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), and the National Mandate Party (PAN). The PKS was the only party not to nominate candidates, but it later threw its support behind the PAN.

The KPU announced the final list of candidates on 14 May. Following the announcement, all candidates were required to undergo medical screening. On 22 May, the commission announced that the PKB&#x27;s presidential candidate, former President Abdurrahman Wahid, had failed the eye test and was not allowed to enter in the election. He initially told supporters not to vote for a presidential candidate on election day but decided to retract that statement after pressure from the party.

===Wiranto and Salahuddin Wahid===

Golkar had won the April legislative election after losing to the PDI-P five years prior. The party nominated retired General Wiranto and Salahuddin Wahid, deputy chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, for its presidential ticket. The pair was assigned the number 1 for its ballot.

Wiranto was an adjutant to former President Suharto in 1989–1993. During this time, he rapidly rose to the rank of full general and eventually became the head of the National Armed Forces. When riots broke out throughout the country in 1998 against Suharto, he refused to take control in order to avoid the deaths of protesting university students. In 1999, as East Timor held an independence referendum, Wiranto was accused of having taken part in inciting violence among East Timorese along with several other officers; however, he was never issued an arrest warrant by Interpol. Under President Abdurrahman Wahid, Wiranto served as the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs but was later dismissed. On 20 April 2004, the Golkar Convention voted to nominate him for president over DPR Speaker Akbar Tanjung in the second round of voting.

On 9 May Golkar selected Salahuddin Wahid (also known as Gus Sholah) as its vice-presidential candidate after an endorsement was made by his brother Abdurrahman. Because Salahuddin was also a deputy chairman of the Central Board of Nahdlatul Ulama, many NU members criticised him for not adhering to the organisation&#x27;s , which affirmed the NU&#x27;s status as a non-political organisation. With this nomination, PKB leaders officially supported the Wiranto–Salahuddin pair for the election.

Salahuddin&#x27;s position on the human rights commission helped the reputation of Wiranto. However, because both candidates were of Javanese background, they were not expected to attract as many voters who were not Javanese.

===Megawati Sukarnoputri and Hasyim Muzadi===

Incumbent President Megawati Sukarnoputri was the PDI-P&#x27;s top nominee. She was joined by vice-presidential candidate Hasyim Muzadi, general chairman of Indonesia&#x27;s largest Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). The pair was assigned the number 2 for its ballot.

According to a report released by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, Megawati has a &quot;unique burden of being the only candidate in the race who is held responsible for the current situation most voters are unhappy with&quot; although several other candidates have been members of her government. However, the general discontent for her presidency was attributed mainly to the failure of the government to communicate Megawati&#x27;s achievements rather than the state of the country itself. The PDI–P came in second during the April legislative election with 18.5% of the votes, a reduction by almost half from the 33.7% it had received in 1999.

Hasyim Muzadi had been mentioned as a possible running mate for Megawati as early as November 2003. His candidacy was officially announced by Megawati on 6 May. As Chairman of the Central Board of Nahdlatul Ulama, he was criticised by many NU members for not adhering to the organisation&#x27;s &quot;khittah&quot; and the principle of political neutrality. Muslim intellectual Nurcholish Madjid had called on him to step down from the position following the announcement of the candidacy.

The two candidates&#x27; Javanese background were not expected to attract as many non-Javanese voters. However, the candidates&#x27; status as civilians attracted those who did not favour candidates with a military background, and they also were expected to attract both secular and religious voters.

===Amien Rais and Siswono Yudo Husodo===

The PAN nominated Amien Rais, chairman of the MPR, as its presidential candidate. His running mate was Siswono Yudohusodo. The pair was assigned the number 3 for its ballot.

Amien Rais had once served as the chairman of Muhammadiyah. However, despite leading the second-largest Islamic organisation in Indonesia, Amien established the PAN following the resignation of President Suharto as a party not based on religious affiliation. He became an influential figure in the early days of the reform period and was eventually elected to lead the MPR. Among voters, he was seen as a candidate who had no association with the corruption that was endemic to the nation&#x27;s government. Voters also saw him as an ambitious person and as one who was known for being an orator. Amien&#x27;s party had received 6.4% of the votes during the legislative election.

On the other hand, Siswono Yudohusodo was a relative newcomer to the political scene. He served as the chairman of the Indonesian Farmers&#x27; Association (HKTI) and held ministerial positions during the later years of Suharto&#x27;s presidency. Siswono was the wealthiest of any candidate for president or vice president based on reports submitted by candidates to the Corruption Eradication Commission.

Like Megawati and Hasyim, Amien and Siswono were also not expected to attract many non-Javanese voters. The pair was supported by the PKS, the seventh party which met the criteria to submit presidential and vice-presidential candidates but did not do so, and a number of smaller parties.

===Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Jusuf Kalla===


The Democratic Party, supported by PKPI and PBB, nominated retired General Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for its presidential candidate. He was later joined by Jusuf Kalla as running mate, and the pair was assigned the number 4 for its ballot.

Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono served in the cabinets of two previous administrations. While serving as Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and Security Affairs under Abdurrahman Wahid, he refused an order to declare a state of emergency that would have stopped the parliamentary process to impeach the President and was subsequently dismissed. Yudhoyono was nominated for vice president after the MPR selected Megawati to succeed Abdurrahman Wahid, but he lost the election to PPP Chairman Hamzah Haz and DPR Speaker Akbar Tanjung. He reprised his prior cabinet position in Megawati&#x27;s administration but resigned on 1 March 2004 to join the race for the presidency. The Democratic Party, established as a vehicle for Yudhoyono&#x27;s political career by secular nationalists who saw the potential of his leadership, received 7.45% of votes and 10% of DPR seats in the April legislative election.

Yudhoyono&#x27;s running mate was Jusuf Kalla, a wealthy Bugis businessman and member of Golkar who served as Coordinating Minister for People&#x27;s Welfare under Megawati. He mediated two separate peaceful resolutions to inter-religious conflicts between Christians and Muslims in his native Sulawesi in 2001 and Maluku in 2002. Kalla joined Golkar&#x27;s selection process for the party&#x27;s presidential nominee in August 2003 but withdrew his candidacy days before the party convention the following April. Several days later, he resigned his cabinet position and announced his alliance with Yudhoyono. Kalla was also seen as a potential vice-presidential candidate for the incumbent Megawati.

The combination brought together two men with very different backgrounds that added to the attractiveness of their ticket. Yudhoyono, who was raised in densely populated Java, is seen as more secular and has a military background. On the other hand, Kalla is a devout Muslim who grew up in the outer province of South Sulawesi and came from a civilian background.

===Hamzah Haz and Agum Gumelar===

Incumbent Vice President Hamzah Haz was the presidential nominee of the PPP. He was joined by Minister of Transportation Agum Gumelar for the vice-presidential candidate. The pair was assigned the number 5 for its ballot.

Hamzah Haz was elected vice president by the MPR after defeating DPR Speaker Akbar Tanjung when it removed President Abdurrahman Wahid from office in 2001. Although the BBC reported him once stating that &quot;no woman was fit to head the world&#x27;s leading Muslim nation&quot;, he came into office as the deputy to Indonesia&#x27;s first female president. Haz served in the cabinet of President B. J. Habibie and was the first minister to resign from the Abdurrahman Wahid administration. He was accused of graft and nepotism but was never subjected to an investigation. As Vice President, Haz had been a proponent of an amendment to the Constitution which would impose Islamic law on Muslims in the country. However, other political parties and the Islamic organisations Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah opposed such amendment for fear of more extreme forms of Islam.

A relatively unknown figure in the political scene, Agum Gumelar served as Minister of Transportation under Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati. In September 2003, Agum had recommended Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono or Jusuf Kalla as Megawati&#x27;s running mate in the presidential election after predicting that the PDI–P would lose a significant number of votes in the April legislative election. However, both men eventually formed their own ticket, and Agum declined a vice-presidential candidate offer from Amien Rais in order to remain on the cabinet. He eventually accepted an offer from the PPP leadership to become Haz&#x27;s running mate and resigned from Megawati&#x27;s administration.

Neither candidate was of Javanese origin; hence, they might have attracted constituencies of the outer provinces.

==Campaign==
Corruption, collusion, and nepotism are the most consistently cited concerns among voters surveyed by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs.

===Schedule===
* 1 June 2004: All candidates sign the commitment of readiness to accept victory or defeat and to conduct a fair campaign. Campaign period begins.
* 1 July 2004: Campaign period ends.
* 5 July 2004: First round of voting.
* 20 September 2004: Second round of voting.
* 4 October 2004: Official second round results announced.
* 20 October 2004: Inauguration of the president-elect and vice president-elect.

==Results==
Former security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won the first round with 33% of the vote. Incumbent President Megawati Sukarnoputri was second with 26%, ahead of former armed forces chief Wiranto on 22%. Yudhoyono did not do as well as earlier opinion polls had suggested, while Megawati did better. This was attributed by Indonesian observers to Yudhoyono&#x27;s lack of a nationwide party machine, such as Megawati&#x27;s PDI-P and Wiranto&#x27;s Golkar.

The counting of 113 million votes, already a massive task in such a large and diverse country, was made more difficult by problems with the ballot papers. Voters cast their ballots by making a hole in the ballot paper with a nail, above the photo of their preferred candidate. Because the ballot paper was handed to voters folded in half, many made the hole without unfolding the ballot, thus making two holes and invalidating their vote. Hundreds of thousands of these votes were invalidated before the General Election Committee (KPU) ruled that such ballots should be accepted. This necessitated recounts in many places, slowing the count and raising fears of a disputed result.

===First round===

Wiranto refused to accept the election results and petitioned the Constitutional Court. Wiranto and Salahuddin argued that, due to irregularities in ballot counting by the KPU, they had lost 5,434,660 votes from twenty-six provinces. Those ballots would have made the total popular vote for the pair higher than that for Megawati and Hasyim, putting the former pair instead of the latter in the second round. However, the Court ruled on 10 August that it found no irregularities and upheld the commission&#x27;s final count.

===Second round===


==Reactions==
*Indonesia: President Megawati Sukarnoputri said in a speech on Armed Forces Day, 5 October, &quot;We have to show to the world we are a big nation. All components of the nation have to stick to the agreement we have struck that whoever is elected in the democratic election has to be accepted. We may have chosen differently. However, we had the same objective: that is to bring the nation to a better future.&quot;
*Australia: Prime Minister John Howard said he planned to attend Yudhoyono&#x27;s inauguration. Howard said, &quot;I look forward to working closely with Dr. Yudhoyono and his new government to continue and extend the close cooperation between our two nations, particularly on counter-terrorism.&quot;
*People&#x27;s Republic of China: Politburo Standing Committee member Wu Guanzheng met with Yudhoyono on 13 October and conveyed congratulations from President Hu Jintao.

==Aftermath==

Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Jusuf Kalla were sworn in as president and vice president on 20 October. It was the first Indonesian presidential inauguration to be attended by foreign leaders. After a selection process that began on 15 October, the United Indonesia Cabinet was announced later following the inauguration. The 36-member cabinet was sworn in at the State Palace on 21 October. The process of selecting candidates for Yudhoyono&#x27;s cabinet was considered &quot;decent, intelligent, and indecisive&quot;. While attempting to satisfy as many members as possible in his coalition of small parties, Yudhoyono created a cabinet that was neither quite as cohesive nor effective. However, Kalla soon became the party chairman of Golkar in late 2004 and turned the party&#x27;s votes in the DPR to those in favour of the government, creating an effective &quot;bloc&quot; and leaving Megawati&#x27;s PDI–P as the largest non-government party in the DPR. Although the first one hundred days of Yudhoyono&#x27;s administration saw continuing economic stability, it was overshadowed by the events of the Indian Ocean earthquake which occurred on 26 December. The earthquake triggered tsunamis that destroyed the coastline of the provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra and killed more than 200,000 people.

<text>Federal Triangle station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., United States. The island-platformed station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines, the station&#x27;s entrance is beneath the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building.

==History==
The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium and the opening of the Arlington Cemetery, Capitol South, Crystal City, Eastern Market, Farragut West, Federal Center SW, Foggy Bottom–GWU, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, McPherson Square, National Airport, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Potomac Avenue, Rosslyn, Smithsonian, and Stadium–Armory stations. Orange Line service to the station began upon the line&#x27;s opening on November 20, 1978. Silver Line service at Federal Triangle began on July 26, 2014.

On January 13, 1982, an eastbound Metro train on the Orange Line derailed just east of the station resulting in three fatalities, the first fatalities in the system&#x27;s history.

From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Between January 15 to January 21, 2021, this station was closed because of security concerns due to the Inauguration of Joe Biden.

== Location ==
The station serves an area of Washington crowded with federal buildings, on 12th Street between Pennsylvania Avenue NW and Constitution Avenue NW, including the triangular area formed by 15th Street, Constitution, and Pennsylvania known as Federal Triangle, from which the station takes its name. The triangle includes such federal buildings as the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, the Herbert C. Hoover Building (Department of Commerce), and the buildings of the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency.

== Station layout ==
Federal Triangle utilizes the simple island platform layout. There are two tracks: track D1 is used for trains bound for New Carrollton and Largo, and track D2 is used for trains going to Franconia–Springfield, Vienna and Ashburn. As with all stations on the Metro, there are platform edge lights to warn passengers of incoming trains. In 2008, WMATA installed red-colored LED lights at Federal Triangle and centrally-located stations after a successful pilot at . There is a coffered barrel-vault ceiling at Federal Triangle, as is typical of other Washington Metro stations built at that time.

There is only one entrance to the platform level, located slightly south of the center of the platform. Escalators from this mezzanine level lead to the plaza of the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building.

== In popular culture ==
The station was featured in the 2007 film Breach .

<text>An alternative lifestyle or unconventional lifestyle is a lifestyle perceived to be outside the norm for a given culture. The term &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot; is often used pejoratively. Description of a related set of activities as alternative is a defining aspect of certain subcultures.

== History ==
Alternative lifestyles and subcultures were first highlighted in the U.S. in the 1920s with the &quot;flapper&quot; movement. Women cut their hair and skirts short (as a symbol of freedom from oppression and the old ways of living). These women were the first large group of females to practice pre-marital sex, dancing, cursing, and driving in modern America without the ostracism that had occurred in earlier instances.

The American press in the 1970s frequently used the term &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot; as a euphemism for homosexuality out of fear of offending a mass audience. The term was also used to refer to hippies, who were seen as a threat to the social order.

==Examples ==
The following is a non-exhaustive list of activities that have been described as alternative lifestyles:
* A Stanford University cooperative house, Synergy, was founded in 1972 with the theme of &quot;exploring alternative lifestyles&quot;.
* Alternative child-rearing, such as homeschooling, coparenting, and home births
* Environmentally-conscious ways of eating, such as veganism, freeganism, or raw foodism
* Living in non-traditional communities, such as communes, intentional communities, ecovillages, off-the-grid, or the tiny house movement
* Traveling subcultures, including lifestyle travellers, digital nomads, housetruckers, and New Age travellers
* Countercultural movements and alternative subcultures such as Bohemianism, punk rock, emo, metal music subculture, antiquarian steampunk, hippies, and vampires
* Body modification, including tattoos, body piercings, eye tattooing, scarification, non-surgical stretching like ears or genital stretching, and transdermal implants
* Nudism and clothing optional lifestyles
* Homosexual lifestyles and relationships.
* Non-normative sexual lifestyles and gender identity-based subcultures, such as BDSM, LGBT culture, cross-dressing, transvestism, polyamory, cruising, swinging, &quot;down-low&quot;, and certain types of sexual fetishism, roleplays, or paraphilias
* Adherents to alternative spiritual and religious communities, such as Freemasons, Ordo Templi Orientis, Thelemites, Satanists, Modern Pagans, and New Age communities
* Certain traditional religious minorities, such as Anabaptist Christians (most notably Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, the Bruderhof Communities, and Schwarzenau Brethren) and ultra-Orthodox Jews, who pursue simple living alongside a non-technological or anti-technology lifestyle
* Secular anti-technology communities called neo-Luddites
* Engagement in artistic pursuits, such as music, visual arts, or performance, often influenced by subcultures like punk, goth, or bohemianism.
* Ethical clothing shopping often with the involvement of sourcing garments through thrifting, exploring garage sales, or even crafting one’s own pieces.

<doc id="581395" wikidata="Q234212" url="?curid=581395" title="Sarah Polley">
<text>Sarah Ellen Polley (born January 8, 1979) is a Canadian filmmaker, writer, political activist and retired actress. She first garnered attention as a child actress for her role as Ramona Quimby in the television series &quot;Ramona&quot;, based on Beverly Cleary&#x27;s books. This subsequently led to her role as Sara Stanley in the Canadian television series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; (1990–1996). She has starred in many feature films, including &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988), &quot;Exotica&quot; (1994), &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; (1997), &quot;Guinevere&quot; (1999), &quot;Go&quot; (1999), &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; (2000), &quot;No Such Thing&quot; (2001), &quot;My Life Without Me&quot; (2003), &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;Splice&quot; (2009), and &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot; (2009).

Polley made her feature film directorial debut with &quot;Away from Her&quot; (2006), for which she won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Director and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Her second film, &quot;Take This Waltz&quot; (2011), premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, followed by her first documentary film, &quot;Stories We Tell&quot; (2012). She also wrote the miniseries &quot;Alias Grace&quot;, based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Margaret Atwood. In 2022, she wrote and directed the film &quot;Women Talking&quot;, based on the 2018 novel of the same name by Miriam Toews, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Early life and education ==
Sarah Ellen Polley was born on January 8, 1979 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the youngest of five children born to Diane Elizabeth Polley ( MacMillan). Her siblings are Susy and John Buchan from Diane&#x27;s first marriage to George Deans-Buchan, and Mark and Joanna Polley from her second marriage to Michael Polley (1933–2018), a British-born actor who became an insurance agent after starting a family with Diane. 

Her mother was an actress (best known for playing Gloria Beechham in 44 episodes of the Canadian TV series &quot;Street Legal&quot;) and a casting director. She died of cancer the week of Polley&#x27;s 11th birthday in 1990.

Polley suffered from severe scoliosis as a child and underwent a spinal operation at 15 that required her to spend the next year in bed recovering.

Polley was raised by Diane and Michael. During her childhood, Polley&#x27;s siblings teased her because she bore no physical resemblance to Michael. Polley discovered as an adult that her biological father was actually Harry Gulkin, with whom her mother had an affair (as chronicled in Polley&#x27;s film &quot;Stories We Tell&quot;). Gulkin, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, was a Quebec-born film producer who produced the 1975 Canadian film &quot;Lies My Father Told Me&quot;, and had met Diane after attending a play in which she acted in Montreal in 1978. When Polley turned 18, she decided to follow up on suggestions from her mother&#x27;s friends that her biological father might be Geoff Bowes—one of three castmates from her mother&#x27;s play in Montreal. Meeting with Gulkin as just someone who could provide information about Diane in Montreal, he informed Polley of his affair with Diane. Gulkin&#x27;s paternity was later confirmed by a DNA test.

Polley attended Subway Academy II, then Earl Haig Secondary School, but dropped out at age 15. By the age of 15 she was living on her own and credits the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty for housing her and developing her work with activism.

In November 2024, Polley received a honorary Doctors of Letters degree from the University of British Columbia Vancouver campus. 

==Career==
===Child acting===
Her first appearance on screen was at the age of four, as Molly in the film &quot;One Magic Christmas&quot;. She was in the pilot episode for &quot;Friday the 13th – The Series&quot; and appeared in a small role in William Fruet&#x27;s sci-fi horror film &quot;Blue Monkey&quot;, both in 1987. At age of eight, she was cast as Ramona Quimby in the television series &quot;Ramona&quot;, based on Beverly Cleary&#x27;s books.

That same year, she played one of the lead characters in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;. Polley burst into the public eye in 1990 as Sara Stanley on the popular CBC television series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;. The series made her famous and financially independent, and she was hailed as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; by the popular press. The show was picked up by the Disney Channel for distribution in the United States. At the age of 12 (around 1991), Polley attended an awards ceremony while wearing a peace sign to protest the first Gulf War. Disney executives asked her to remove it, and she refused. This soured her relationship with Disney, but she continued on &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; until 1994. The show ran until 1996; Polley did return as Sara Stanley for an episode in 1995 and for the series finale.

In 1994 Polley made her theatre debut at the Stratford Festival playing Alice in &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot;, an adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s book of the same name. Polley ended her run early, claiming complications from scoliosis. In 2022 she revealed she had in fact been suffering from intense stage fright, something that continued to plague her into adulthood.

===Adult acting===
Polley appeared as Lily on the CBC television series &quot;Straight Up&quot;, which ran from 1996 to 1998, winning the Gemini Award for Best Performance in a Children&#x27;s or Youth Program or Series for her role. By age thirteen, however, Polley was dissatisfied with her juvenile acting career. Her experience with director Atom Egoyan in a small but critical role in his sophisticated adult drama &quot;Exotica&quot; turned things around, as she revealed in a 2022 conversation with the director, filmed for Criterion&#x27;s &quot;Exotica&quot; BluRay. Polley&#x27;s subsequent role as Nicole Burnell in Egoyan&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; brought her considerable attention in the United States; she was a favourite at the Sundance Film Festival. Her character in the film was an aspiring singer, and on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, she performed covers of The Tragically Hip&#x27;s &quot;Courage&quot; and Jane Siberry&#x27;s &quot;One More Colour&quot; and sang the film&#x27;s title track, which she co-wrote with Mychael Danna.

In 1998, Polley appeared in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Last Night&quot;. The following year, she starred as part of the ensemble cast in the film &quot;Go&quot;. She was cast in the role of Penny Lane in the big-budget 2000 film &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, but dropped out of the project to return to Canada for the low-budget &quot;The Law of Enclosures&quot;. Her role in the 2003 film &quot;My Life Without Me&quot; garnered the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in 2004. In the same year, she starred in a lead role in the remake of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, which was a departure from her other indie roles.

In 2005, she starred in &quot;The Secret Life of Words&quot;, opposite Tim Robbins and Julie Christie. She was nominated for the European Film Award for Best Actress by the European Film Academy for her role as Hanna.

In 2006, Polley took a role on the acclaimed series &quot;Slings and Arrows&quot; during its third and final season. Polley&#x27;s father, Michael Polley, was a regular on the show during its entire three-season run. She served as a member of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival jury.

In 2008, Polley appeared as Nabby Adams in the HBO miniseries based on the life of John Adams. Polley played Elise in Jaco Van Dormael&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;, which was released in 2010. Critical response has praised the film&#x27;s artistry and Polley&#x27;s acting. Later that year, she also appeared in a cameo role in Bruce MacDonald&#x27;s film &quot;Trigger&quot;.

Though Polley never officially announced her retirement from acting, she has not taken an acting role since 2010, transitioning into a writing and directing career.

===Directing===
In 1999, Polley made her first short film, &quot;The Best Day of My Life&quot;, for the On the Fly 4 Film Festival. She also made a second short film that year, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice&quot;. Polley attended the Canadian Film Centre&#x27;s directing program in 2001, and won the Genie Award for Best Live Action Short Drama in 2003 for her short film &quot;I Shout Love&quot;. She made her feature-length film directing debut with &quot;Away from Her&quot;, which Polley adapted from the Alice Munro short story &quot;The Bear Came Over the Mountain&quot;. The movie, starring Julie Christie (with whom she had played in &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, 2001, and &quot;The Secret Life of Words&quot;, 2005), debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2006, as part of the TIFF&#x27;s Gala showcase.

&quot;Away from Her&quot; was acquired by Lionsgate for release in the US for the sum of $750,000. It drew rave reviews from &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and the three Toronto dailies, both for the performances of Christie and her co-star, Canadian actor Gordon Pinsent, and for Polley&#x27;s direction. It also earned Polley a 2007 Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, and won the Genie Award for Best Achievement in Direction. At the 2008 Genies, she was also awarded the Claude Jutra Award, which recognizes outstanding achievement by a first-time feature film director.

Polley wrote and directed her second feature, &quot;Take This Waltz&quot; starring Michelle Williams, Luke Kirby, Seth Rogen, and Sarah Silverman, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2011.

Her documentary film &quot;Stories We Tell&quot; premiered at the 69th Venice International Film Festival in competition in the Venice Days category, and its North American premiere followed at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival. The critically acclaimed documentary examined family secrets in Polley&#x27;s own childhood. She was awarded the CAN$100,000 prize for best Canadian film of the year by the Toronto Film Critics Association. In 2017, Polley executive produced the film &quot;A Better Man&quot; (2017),

In late 2012, Polley announced that she would be adapting Margaret Atwood&#x27;s novel &quot;Alias Grace&quot;. Polley first wrote to Atwood asking to adapt the novel when she was 17. They held off for 20 years until she was ready to make the show. In August 2014, during a profile of her work as a director, Polley announced that &quot;Alias Grace&quot; was being adapted into a six-part miniseries. In June 2016, the series was confirmed with Polley writing and producing. The series premiered in 2017 on CBC Television in Canada; it streams on Netflix globally, outside of Canada. It received positive reviews from critics.

In June 2014, it was announced that Polley would write and direct an adaptation of John Green&#x27;s &quot;Looking for Alaska&quot;. In March 2015, she was hired to potentially write and direct a new adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot;. Her involvement in the project ultimately never went beyond initial discussion. In her 2022 essay collection &quot;Run Towards the Danger&quot;, Polley revealed she had been working on a second draft of the &quot;Little Women&quot; screenplay when she had a traumatic head injury resulting in post-concussion syndrome that left her with symptoms for four years so she was temporarily unable to work until she found effective treatment through University of Pittsburgh Medical Center&#x27;s concussion program. It was subsequently announced in June that, due to scheduling conflicts, Polley would no longer be directing &quot;Looking for Alaska&quot;.

In an interview, Polley stated that she takes pride in her work and enjoys both acting and directing, but is not keen on combining the two:I like the feeling of keeping them separate. I find that really gratifying. I can&#x27;t imagine combining those. For me, I love the feeling of using different parts of my brain separately. In a 2015 retrospective of the movie &quot;Go&quot;, Mike D&#x27;Angelo of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; commented that Polley&#x27;s decision to go into directing had &quot;deprived the world of many potentially great performances&quot;, calling her a &quot;superb actor&quot;. In December 2020, it was announced Polley would direct &quot;Women Talking&quot; based upon the novel of the same name by Miriam Toews for Orion Pictures. It premiered at the 49th Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2022, and went into wide release on December 23, 2022. It was released to widespread acclaim, with 90% of critics giving it a positive review on Rotten Tomatoes. Shirley Li of The Atlantic called it &quot;vibrant cinema,&quot; while Anna Bogutskaya of &quot;Time Out&quot; said that it &quot;imagines female emancipation as an honest, raging, caring experience.&quot; Polley won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 95th Academy Awards, and the film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
In 2023, Polley was revealed to be in talks to direct Disney&#x27;s live action adaptation of &quot;Bambi&quot;, but in March 2024, it never came in fruition due to Polley reportedly no longer being attached as a director.

===Writing===
Polley has written numerous essays over the years about her experiences as a child star. In 2022, she released her first book of essays, the autobiographical, &quot;Run Towards the Danger&quot; which contains six essays that examine aspects of Polley&#x27;s career on stage, screen, and on film, detailing her roles in a Stratford Festival production of &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot;, as well as her breakout roles in &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; and the TV series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;. The book also alleged for the first time that Polley had been a victim of Jian Ghomeshi who she says sexually and physically assaulted her when she was 16 and he was 28.

==Political and social activism==

Following the row with Disney as a twelve-year-old for wearing a peace sign to protest against the Gulf War, Polley dedicated more of her efforts to politics, becoming a prominent member of the Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP), where Ontario legislator Peter Kormos was her political mentor. In 1996, she gave a nomination speech for Kormos at the ONDP leadership convention which she later referred to as the &quot;proudest moment in [her] life&quot;.

In 1995, she lost two back teeth after being struck by a riot police officer during a protest against the provincial Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris in Queen&#x27;s Park. She was subsequently involved with the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty. She subsequently scaled back her political activism.
She was part of a group in 2001 which opposed the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. The 3rd Summit of the Americas was held in Quebec City in April 2001. In 2003, she was part of former Toronto mayor David Miller&#x27;s transition advisory team.

In 2009, Polley directed a two-minute short film in support of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. In advance of the film&#x27;s airing in Canada during the 82nd Academy Awards, and following news reports that characterized the film as a marketing exercise for the margarine company Becel, Polley withdrew her association with the film. &quot;In December 2009, I made a film to be aired during the Academy Awards that I believed was to promote the Heart and Stroke Foundation. When I agreed to make this film [&quot;The Heart&quot;], I was thrilled, as I was proud to be associated with the work of this incredible organization. However, I have since learned that my film is also being used to promote a product. Regretfully, I am forced to remove my name from the film and disassociate myself from it. I have never actively promoted any corporate brand, and cannot do so now.&quot; In response, Becel said it was a &quot;founding sponsor&quot; of the Heart Truth campaign and had commissioned the film &quot;to put heart health on the radar of Canadian women&quot;.

In January 2012, Polley endorsed Toronto MP Peggy Nash in the 2012 New Democratic Party leadership race to succeed Jack Layton.

On October 15, 2017, Polley wrote an op-ed piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; detailing her experience with Harvey Weinstein and with Hollywood&#x27;s treatment of women generally, and making a connection between Hollywood&#x27;s gendered power relations and Polley&#x27;s not having acted in years.

==Personal life==

In 2007, Polley discovered the man who raised her, Michael Polley, was not her biological father. The story of her mother&#x27;s affair with her biological father, producer Harry Gulkin, was chronicled in her 2012 film, &quot;Stories We Tell&quot;.

On September 10, 2003, Polley married Canadian film editor David Wharnsby, her boyfriend of seven years. They divorced in 2008. On August 23, 2011, she married David Sandomierski. They have three children.

In her 2022 autobiographical essay collection, &quot;Run Towards the Danger&quot;, Polley said she was sexually assaulted by Moxy Früvous singer Jian Ghomeshi on a 1995 date, while she was 16 and he was 28. Family and friends dissuaded her from coming forward.

Polley is an atheist.

<text>Smithsonian station is a Washington Metro station at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., United States. The side platformed station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). It is a stop on the Blue, Orange and Silver Lines. The station&#x27;s south entrance is at the southwest corner of Independence Avenue and 12th Street, Southwest, the street elevator is at the northwest corner of the same intersection, and the north entrance is on the south side of the Mall near Jefferson Drive, Southwest.

The station is named for its proximity to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s museums and is close to the Washington Monument, the Tidal Basin and other tourist attractions on and near the National Mall. The station is also near several federal office buildings, including those of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy.

== History ==

The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium and the opening of the Arlington Cemetery, Capitol South, Crystal City, Eastern Market, Farragut West, Federal Center SW, Federal Triangle, Foggy Bottom–GWU, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, McPherson Square, National Airport, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Potomac Avenue, Rosslyn, and Stadium–Armory stations. Orange Line service to the station began upon the line&#x27;s opening on November 20, 1978. Silver Line service at Smithsonian station began on July 26, 2014.

Near this station, Metro had its first fatalities, which occurred on January 13, 1982, when a train derailed. On the same day, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the 14th Street Bridge. The two events closed the federal government in the Washington Metropolitan Area.

The Smithsonian station was closed all day on the Fourth of July from 2002 to 2008, as its north entrance is within the secure perimeter established around the National Mall during Independence Day events. Metro stopped closing Smithsonian station on July 4 beginning in 2009.

On April 14, 2016, Metro proposed to change the name of the station adding &quot;National Mall&quot; to the station name.

On June 25, 2017, &quot;National Mall&quot; was added as a subtitle to &quot;Smithsonian&quot;.

From March 19, 2020, until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

From January 15 to January 21, 2021, this station was closed because of security concerns due to the Inauguration of Joe Biden, in light of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

<doc id="581399" wikidata="Q2668150" url="?curid=581399" title="James Murray (British Army officer, born 1721)">
<text>General James Murray (20 January 1721 – 18 June 1794) was a British army officer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of Quebec from 1760 to 1768 and governor of Minorca from 1778 to 1782. Born in Ballencrieff, East Lothian, Murray travelled to North America and took part in the French and Indian War. After the conflict, his administration of the Province of Quebec was noted for its successes, being marked by positive relationships with French Canadians, who were reassured of the traditional rights and customs. Murray died in Battle, East Sussex in 1794.

==Early life==

Born in Ballencrieff, East Lothian, Murray was a younger son of Lord Elibank Alexander Murray, 4th Lord Elibank, and his wife, Elizabeth Stirling. His cousin was Alexander Murray who served in Nova Scotia. Educated in Haddington, East Lothian and Selkirk, Scottish Borders, he began his military career in 1736 in the Scots Brigade of the Dutch States Army. In 1740 he served as a second lieutenant in John Wynyard&#x27;s Regiment of Marines under his brother Patrick Murray, 5th Lord Elibank in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias. He returned as a captain in 1742. He served as captain of the grenadier company of the 15th Regiment of Foot during the War of the Austrian Succession. He was severely wounded during the siege of Ostend in 1745 and distinguished himself in the Raid on Lorient in 1746. In December 1748, he married Cordelia Collier, who was from Hastings.

==Career in Canada==

James Murray purchased a commission for major in the 15th Regiment of Foot in 1749, and the lieutenant-colonelcy in 1751. He commanded his regiment in the Raid on Rochefort in 1757, defending Sir John Mordaunt in his subsequent court-martial. He commanded a battalion in the 1758 Siege of Louisbourg along with his brother Alexander.

When Louisbourg was taken, Murray accompanied General Wolfe on a raiding expedition northwards in the Gulf of St. Lawrence Campaign (1758). While Wolfe destroyed French settlements along the Gaspe Peninsula, Murray harried the French fishing settlements along Miramichi Bay. Part of the destruction included the homes and church at St. Anne&#x27;s, now called Burnt Church.

Murray served under General James Wolfe at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759. Murray believed Wolfe&#x27;s plan to land the army at Anse au Foulon was foolish and absurd, and succeeded &quot;only by Providence&quot;. He was the military commander of Quebec City after it fell to the British. Lévis managed to defeat Murray and the British in the Battle of Sainte-Foy in 1760. As a result, the French managed to lay siege to Quebec but this had to be abandoned due to a lack of supplies and the arrival of a British relief fleet.

He encouraged his favourite nephew Patrick Ferguson to follow him in a military career. Patrick was the son of Murray&#x27;s sister Anne who was married to Lord Pitfour. He also assisted another nephew, Patrick Murray, illegitimate son of his brother, George.

Murray&#x27;s successful part in the British advance on Montreal in which he pacified many of the French Canadians, showed his true worth as a military commander and a negotiator. On 5 September 1760, Murray signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Huron Nation, then residing at Lorette, near Quebec City. In 1990, that treaty was found by the Supreme Court of Canada to still be valid and binding on the Crown.

===Governor of Quebec===
In October 1760, he became military governor of the district of Quebec and became the first civil governor of the Province of Quebec on 4 October 1763. He was promoted Major-General on 26 March 1765. As governor he was sympathetic to the French-Canadians, favouring them over British merchants who came to settle in the wake of the conquest. He allowed the continuance of French civil law because at the time the French outnumbered the British 25:1 and he needed to be careful not to incite discontent or rebellion. The dissatisfaction of British settlers led to his recall in 1766 (although he remained governor in name until 1768), but his precedents were preserved in the Quebec Act of 1774. Murray successfully argued for the Quebec Act to continue slavery in Quebec as it had existed under the French; an advertisement appeared in the &quot;Quebec Gazette&quot; in 1769 for a &quot;negro woman, aged 25 years, with a mulatto male child... formerly the property of General Murray&quot;.

On his return to Great Britain he was appointed Colonel of the 13th Regiment of Foot, a post he held from 1767 to 1789.

==Minorca==

Murray was lieutenant-governor from 1774 to 1778 and then governor of Minorca from 1778 to 1782. In 1780, he married, as his second wife, Ann Witham, daughter of the Consul-General there. During the American War of Independence, he defended Fort St. Philip, at Port Mahon, against a Franco-Spanish siege for seven months (1781–82), until forced to surrender. He was known as ‘Old Minorca’ Murray as a result.

He then returned to his home, Beauport Park, in Hollington, Sussex, where he died. Further honours came to him in his last years: he was appointed General, and Governor of Kingston-upon-Hull in 1783, and Colonel of the 21st (Royal North British) Fusiliers in 1789. His body was laid to rest in the apse of the now ruined Old St Helen&#x27;s Church, Hastings.

==Family==
His first marriage had been childless, but with his second wife Ann Witham, he had six children (two of whom died in infancy):
* James Patrick Murray, later a major general, who married Elizabeth Rushworth
* Cordelia Murray, who married Rev. Henry Hodges
* Wilhelmina Murray, married James Douglas, 4th Baron Douglas.
* George Murray (died in infancy)
* Elizabeth Mary Murray (died in infancy)
* Anne Harriet Murray

He and his wife also brought up his older brother Patrick, Lord Elibank&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Maria Murray.

==Popular culture==
Murray appears in the 2004 film &quot;Battle of the Brave (Nouvelle-France)&quot; in his role as Governor of the new-captured Quebec. He is portrayed by Michael Maloney. He also appears in the same capacity in three episodes of the mini-series Marguerite Volant, where he is portrayed by Graham Harley.

<doc id="581401" wikidata="Q1412022" url="?curid=581401" title="Disability pension">
<text>A disability pension is a form of pension given to those people who are permanently or temporarily unable to work due to a disability.

== North America ==
An example of a disability pension is from a private or Public Pension Plan, or the Canada Pension Plan. Another example is Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) in the United States.

Generally, there is a minimum time of service required to be eligible for the disability retirement benefit. The claimant might be directed to sign a waiver for their medical records to be disclosed and commonly is scheduled for an independent medical evaluation (IME) to confirm they are permanently disabled. The pension is calculated based on years worked, so the disability retiree can retire earlier (since they are unable to work), but receives an equitable pension based on years of service.

== Australasia ==
=== Australia ===
Australian residents of working age who are unable to work for 15 hours a week for the next two years are eligible for the Disability Support Pension. Those intending to claim the DSP need to provide a report from their treating doctor.

Beneficiaries of the Disability Support Pension receive significantly more than those on unemployment benefits; as of 1 October 2023 the basic rate is A$1096.70 per fortnight for singles with a child under care and A$826.70 for each member of a couple.

The Disability Support Pension, previously known as the Invalid Pension, were first introduced in the state of New South Wales in 1908. The Commonwealth government introduced a nationwide Invalid Pension on 5 December 1910.
Australians who are temporarily unable to work due to illness, injury or a short-term disability may be eligible for Sickness Allowance. Sickness Allowance pays less than the DSP; as of 1 January 2009, single recipients were entitled to a basic rate of A$449.30 per fortnight and couples A$405.30 for each person. However Sickness allowance was discontinued since 20 September 2020.

Like all Australian social security payments, eligibility for the DSP is not dependent on individual contributions; rather, benefits are paid out of general Commonwealth government revenue.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand income support exists for people with physical or mental health issues. The two main disability benefits are the Sickness Benefit, and the Invalid&#x27;s Benefit. A doctor&#x27;s referral and medical certificate (or equivalent) is needed to claim the benefits. The Invalid&#x27;s Benefit is for someone who has a severe disability, and/or long term sickness, which is paid slightly more than the Sickness Benefit. In addition, there is the Disability Allowance, to supplement medical costs. If the Disability Allowance does not pay for all medical costs, then Temporary Additional Support is provided, but obtaining it is more difficult. All of these benefits have maximum limits, depending on such things as income (both the individual and their partner) and cash assets. Note that the Sickness Benefit and Invalid&#x27;s Benefit are for people aged less than 65 but the Disability Allowance is for anyone over 18 years.

=== China ===
According to central government guidelines, the basic pension insurance is set to 40% of the insured monthly wage. The disabled person is also eligible to receive temporary and permanent disability benefits. Temporary benefits are in the amount of 100% of the individual&#x27;s wage up to one year. There are 10 degrees of disability, with the percentage of the wage that the person receives ranging from 90%(for a first degree disability) to 60% (for a 6th degree disability). In addition to the pension, the person receives a benefit in the amount of 27 months worth of the person&#x27;s previous wage (for a first degree disability) to 7 months of wages (for a 10th degree disability). The minimum amount of a benefit is determined by the minimum wage in the area.

== Europe ==

=== European Union ===
Disability pension calculations vary depending on the country. Countries like Czech Republic, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom apply a risk-based logic. In this case the length of the period when the individual was insured is not important, only that he or she was insured when the invalidity occurred. Other countries use a pro-rata method, were the pension is higher for people who had been insured for a longer time.

==== France ====
• To be able to apply for a disability pension or as it is calles in France pension d&#x27;invalidité there should be fulfilled the following conditions:
1-Age requirement: The person has not reached yet the legal age for retirement. (for this country is 62 years old.)
2-Working capacity: The person should have significantly lost his/her capability of working. The person must have a permanent disability over 80% (case of blind people) or vary to a range of 50%-60% disability which is the case of people certified as &quot;unable to procure employment due to a disability&quot;.
3-Contributions: The person must have paid at least 12 months social security contributions before the day he/she is diagnosed. 
4-Nationality: Being French is not a requirement. Having a proof that proves the legality of the residence in the country is necessary.

• Categories 
For considering the amount of disability benefit there are 2 factors considered: 1) The salary and the social security contributions and 2) The category of the disability. Categories are divided as follow:
1- 1st Category: This category belongs to people who are still able to do some job that can be paid. The benefit is calculated in this form: SAM X 30%. (Average annual income*30%). The maximum annual amount of the pension is equal to 993.30 Euro per month, considering the social security threshold: €11,919.60.
2- 2nd Category: This category belongs to people who are not capable of paid working and cannot perform professional activities anymore. The benefit is calculated in this form: SAM X 50%. (Average annual income*50%). The maximum annual amount of the pension is equal to €1,655.50 per month, considering the SST (social security threshold): €19,866.
3- 3rd Category: This category belongs to people who are not capable of performing paid working and cannot perform professional activities anymore and are obliged to use assistance of a third person to meet the needs of everyday life. Comparing to previous category, the normal pension is increased by 40% reaching the maximum amount of €2,763 per month.

[SAM: Average yearly income. It represents the pension scheme of employees in its 10 best performance which are revalued and divided by 10. (in the case there are 10 years of work) 
SST: Social security threshold is the maximum total that is defined each year under basis of which contributions and certain social security allowances are calculated.(In 2018 estimation, annual amount was €39,732)

• Allowance for adults that have disabilities.
Apart from pension d&#x27;invalidité People with significant disabilities and low incomes can manage to receive an addition allowance named as AAH (allocation aux adultes handicapés). To benefit from this additional help, the factor of low income is strongly considered. For example: in 2017 a single disabled person with no children can be considered in AAH benefit only if the income was lower than 9,730.68 EUR per year.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, the government department responsible for benefits for sick and disabled people is the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).

The United Kingdom pension types for disabled people are:

* Disability Living Allowance (DLA) which is a benefit for children who have walking difficulties or need personal care due to physical, mental or sensory disability. It was historically also available to people of working age (up to the age of 65)
* Personal Independence Payment (PIP) which is a new benefit for people of working age (between 18 and state pension age), who need help with personal care and/or mobility due to physical or mental disability. PIP will continue to be paid to claimants after they reach state pension age.
* Attendance Allowance (AA) which is a benefit for people over the state pension age (65), who need help with personal care due to physical or mental disability. Since PIP claims continue beyond pension age, AA will effectively be gradually superseded, taking a couple of decades to fade away.

In order to cover loss of income from illness and disability, there is also Statutory Sick Pay, and its long term equivalent - Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The new Universal Credit scheme will include an equivalent element for those with long-term unfitness to work; ESA will consequently be abolished by the roll out of Universal Credit.

==== Czech Republic ====
There used to be a &quot;partial&quot; and &quot;full&quot; disability pensions, but as of 2010, there is no longer a difference between these two types. Depending on how severe the disability of the individual is, (i.e. how much their ability to work has decreased) they can be categorized into one of three degrees of disability. The degree of disability is determined by a health and capacity to work evaluation conducted by the Czech Social Security Administration&#x27;s evaluation service. 
An individual has to meet certain requirements in order to apply for a disability pension. A person is not eligible for a disability pension if they have already reached the age of 65, when one is already eligible for a standard old-age pension. The applicant must also meet the required term of insurance which rises with rising age. In case of an individual younger than 20 years, less than one year of insurance contributions are required. When the applicant is over 28 years old it is required that he has made at least 5 years of insurance contributions in his past 10 years. At an age higher than 38, 10 ears of previous insurance contributions are required. The required term of insurance is waived if the applicant&#x27;s disability is from an accident at work or occupational disease or if the applicant has been declared disabled since childhood.

The disability pension consists of two components. The first is a basic amount which is fixed to 9% of average wages (2,700 CZK in 2018) . The second components is a percentage amount from the average of previous wages. The percentage is determined individually from the number of insured years. This amount is higher for higher degrees of disabilities.

==== Portugal ====
An individual is entitled to a disability pension [&quot;Pensão de invalidez&quot;] when the incompetency to work is certified by &quot;Sistema de Verificação de Incapacidades (SVI)&quot; [Incapacity Verification System], and the beneficiary has met the minimum qualifying period requirement.

Disability is classified into two categories. It may be relative or absolute. In the case of a relative disability, the beneficiary&#x27;s earning capacity for his or her own occupation is reduced, and he or she is not expected to recover within the next three years, and the beneficiary has registered earnings for at least five calendar years, consecutive or not. In the case of an absolute disability, the beneficiary is permanently and definitively incapable of working in any occupation and has registered earnings for at least 3 calendar years, consecutive or not.

The amount to be paid as a disability pension varies depending on the beneficiary&#x27;s registered earnings and security contributions. There are minimum rates, for specific time ranges of contributions of the beneficiary. In addition to monthly disability pensions, the beneficiaries receive an extra payment in July and December as a holiday and Christmas bonus.

==== Finland ====
Disability pension in Finland is usually paid to an individual after they have already received a sickness benefit for around a year. In the case of not being able to work in their job or a similar one even after that one year, the individual can apply for a disability pension. &quot;Disability pension can be granted to people aged 18–62 who are part of the earnings-related pension system.&quot; In case an individual is unable to work at all (specifically if their ability to work has decreased b at least 3/5), they may receive a full disability pension (&quot;työkyvyttömyyseläke).&quot; If the individual is partially unable to work (specifically if their ability to work has decreased by 2/5), they may receive a partial disability pension, which is half of the full disability pension.

When calculating the amount of the pension, there is a so-called projected pension component added to the pension. The projected pension component is made if the individual

* earned €17,807.01 in total (in 2019) over 10 calendar years before they became disabled
* paid earnings-related pension insurance on income.

The accrued rate is 1.5% of gross wages for the 5 years prior to disability retirement.

The disability pension can also be increased by a rehabilitation benefit which is an additional 33% of the original pension amount. (2019)

<text>Thylacinus is a genus of extinct carnivorous marsupials in the family Thylacinidae. The only recent member was the thylacine (&quot;Thylacinus cynocephalus&quot;), commonly also known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf. The last known Tasmanian tiger was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Tasmania, eventually dying in 1936. The earliest known member of the genus, &quot;Thylacinus macknessi&quot; appeared during the Early Miocene, around 16 million years ago, and was smaller than the modern thylacine, with a body mass of about . &quot;Thylacinus&quot; represented the only extant genus of the family after the beginning of the Pliocene around 5 million years ago. Over time members of the genus saw an increase in body mass and a greater adaption to hypercarnivory in their dental morphology.

A tooth referable to &quot;Thylacinus&quot; was collected from the Late Oligocene Wayne&#x27;s Wok site at the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, making it the oldest record of the genus.

<text>Sir James Augustus Henry Murray, FBA (; 7 February 1837 – 26 July 1915) was a British lexicographer and philologist. He was the primary editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) from 1879 until his death.

== Life and learning ==
James Murray was born in the village of Denholm near Hawick in the Scottish Borders, the eldest son of a draper, Thomas Murray. His brothers included Charles Oliver Murray and A. D. Murray, later editor of the &quot;Newcastle Daily Journal&quot;. He was christened plain &#x27;James Murray&#x27;, but in 1855 he assumed the extra names &#x27;Augustus Henry&#x27; in order to distinguish himself from other James Murrays in the Hawick area. A precocious child with a voracious appetite for learning, he left school at fourteen because his parents were not able to afford to pay the fees to continue his education. At seventeen he became a teacher at Hawick Grammar School (now Hawick High School) and three years later he was headmaster of the Subscription Academy there. In 1856, he was one of the founders of the Hawick Archaeological Society.

In 1861, Murray met a music teacher, Maggie Scott, whom he married the following year. Two years later, they had a daughter Anna, who soon died of tuberculosis, then known as consumption. Maggie, too, fell ill with the same disease, and on the advice of doctors, the couple moved to London to escape the Scottish winters. Once there, Murray took an administrative job with the Chartered Bank of India while continuing in his spare time to pursue his many and varied academic interests. Maggie died within a year of arrival in London. A year later Murray was engaged to Ada Agnes Ruthven and the following year he married her. Their best man was his friend Alexander Graham Bell, who had earlier received instruction from Murray in elementary electricity, and often referred to him as &quot;the grandfather of the telephone&quot;.

By this time Murray was primarily interested in languages and etymology, the origin of words. Some idea of the depth and range of his linguistic erudition may be gained from a letter of application he wrote to Thomas Watts, Keeper of Printed Books at the British Museum, in which he claimed an &#x27;intimate acquaintance&#x27; with Italian, French, Catalan, Spanish, and Latin, and &#x27;to a lesser degree Portuguese, Vaudois, Provençal &amp; various dialects&#x27;. In addition, he was &#x27;tolerably familiar&#x27; with Dutch, German, and Danish. His studies of Anglo-Saxon and Mœso-Gothic had been &#x27;much closer&#x27;, he knew &#x27;a little of the Celtic&#x27; and was at the time &#x27;engaged with the Slavonic, having obtained a useful knowledge of the Russian&#x27;. He had &#x27;sufficient knowledge of Hebrew and Syriac to read and cite the Old Testament and Peshito&#x27; and to a lesser degree he knew Aramaic, Arabic, Coptic, and Phoenician. However, he did not get the job.

By 1869, Murray was on the council of the Philological Society, and by 1873 had given up his job at the bank and returned to teaching at Mill Hill School. He then published &quot;The Dialect of the Southern Counties of Scotland&quot;, which served to enhance his reputation in philological circles. In 1881, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Murray had eleven children with Ada (all having &#x27;Ruthven&#x27; in their name, by arrangement with his father-in-law, George Ruthven); the eldest, Harold James Ruthven Murray became a prominent chess historian, Sir Oswyn Murray was permanent secretary at the Admiralty (United Kingdom) from 1917 to 1936, and Wilfrid George Ruthven Murray wrote an account of his father. All the eleven children survived to maturity (which was unusual at that time) and helped him in the compilation of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED).

He died of pleurisy on 26 July 1915 and requested to be buried in Oxford beside the grave of his best friend, James Legge.

== Murray and the &quot;OED&quot; ==

On 26 April 1878, Murray was invited to Oxford to meet the Delegates of the Oxford University Press, with a view to his taking on the job of editor of a new dictionary of the English language, to replace &quot;Johnson&#x27;s&quot; and to capture all the words then extant in the English speaking world in all their various shades of meaning.
On 1 March 1879, a formal agreement was put in place to the effect that Murray was to edit a new English Dictionary, which would eventually become the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED). It was expected to take ten years to complete and be some 7,000 pages long, in four volumes. In fact, when the final results were published in 1928, it ran to twelve volumes, with 414,825 words defined and 1,827,306 citations employed to illustrate their meanings.

In preparation for the work ahead, Murray built a corrugated-iron shed in the grounds of Mill Hill School, called the Scriptorium, to house his small team of assistants as well as the flood of slips (bearing quotations illustrating the use of words to be defined in the dictionary) which started to flow in as a result of his appeal. As work continued on the early part of the dictionary, Murray gave up his job as a teacher and became a full-time lexicographer.

In the summer of 1884, Murray and his family moved to a large house on the Banbury Road in north Oxford. Murray had a second Scriptorium built in its back garden, a larger building than the first, with more storage space for the ever-increasing number of slips being sent to Murray and his team. Anything addressed to &quot;Mr Murray, Oxford&quot; would always find its way to him, and such was the volume of post sent by Murray and his team that the Post Office erected a special post box outside Murray&#x27;s house. Murray became president of the Oxford Philatelic Society, making use of the substantial collection of postage stamps he received from his many readers around the world.

Murray continued his work on the dictionary, age and failing health doing nothing to diminish his enthusiasm for the work to which he had devoted much of his life. Despite his devotion to the dictionary, which was recognized by his knighthood in 1908, Murray remained a relative outsider in Oxford, never fully taking part in university academic and Senior Common Room life. He was never made a Fellow of an Oxford college, and received an Oxford honorary doctorate only the year before his death.

William Chester Minor was a major contributor to the OED. He became one of the project&#x27;s most effective volunteers and came to the attention of Murray, who visited him in January 1891. In 1899, Murray paid compliment to Minor&#x27;s enormous contributions to the dictionary, stating, &quot;we could easily illustrate the last four centuries from his quotations alone&quot;.

== In literature and film ==

The book &quot;The Surgeon of Crowthorne&quot; (published in America as &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot;), by Simon Winchester, was published in 1998 and chronicles both Minor&#x27;s later life and his contributions to the creation of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

The movie rights for the book were bought by Mel Gibson&#x27;s Icon Productions in 1998. Farhad Safinia directed the film adaptation, called &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot;, starring Gibson as Murray and Sean Penn as Minor. The film was released in May 2019.

In 2003, Winchester published a broader history, &quot;The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary,&quot; which includes the origins of the Oxford English Dictionary and its completion nearly seventy years later.

&quot;The Dictionary of Lost Words&quot; (2020) is a best-selling novel by Australian author Pip Williams, much of which is set in the scriptorium where Murray and his team worked on the OED.

== Honorary degrees ==
He was awarded honorary doctoral degrees by nine universities, including:

* LL.D from the University of Glasgow in June 1901.
* D.Litt. from the University of Oxford in 1914.

<doc id="581411" wikidata="Q928304" url="?curid=581411" title="The Fugs">
<text>The Fugs are an American rock band formed in New York City in late 1964, by the poets Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg, with Ken Weaver on drums. Soon afterward, they were joined by Peter Stampfel and Steve Weber of the Holy Modal Rounders. Kupferberg named the band from a euphemism for &quot;fuck&quot; used in Norman Mailer&#x27;s novel &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;.

The band was one of the leaders of the underground scene of the 1960s and became an important part of the American counterculture of that decade. The group is known for its comedic, even lewd, nature but also earned fame through its persistent anti-Vietnam War sentiment during the 1960s. A famous song of theirs was &quot;Kill for Peace&quot;, on their 1966 album The Fugs. 

Some 1969 correspondence, found inside an FBI file on the rock group the Doors, called the Fugs the &quot;most vulgar thing the human mind could possibly conceive&quot;. They have been derided for their scatological lyrics. But, Tom Robbins wrote of them in 1968, &quot;Incongruously… this trio of hairy gross ginch gropers is the most intellectual, sophisticated and literary ensemble in rock.&quot; The Fugs have been labeled avant-rock noise music.

== Formation ==
The band&#x27;s original core members, Ed Sanders, Tuli Kupferberg, and Ken Weaver, were joined at various times in the 1960s by a number of others, some of whom were noted session musicians or members of other bands. These included Weber and Stampfel, bassist John Anderson, guitarist Vinny Leary, guitarist Peter Kearney, keyboardist Lee Crabtree, guitarist Jon Kalb, guitarist Stefan Grossman, singer and guitarist Jake Jacobs, guitarist Eric Gale, bassist Chuck Rainey, keyboardist Robert Banks, bassist Charles Larkey, guitarist Ken Pine, guitarist Danny Kortchmar, clarinetist Perry Robinson, bassist Bill Wolf, and drummer Bob Mason.

For most of their career, the Fugs were composed of the primary singer-songwriters Sanders and, until his death, Kupferberg; the composer, songwriter, guitarist and long-time Allen Ginsberg collaborator Steven Taylor; singer-songwriter and percussionist Coby Batty; and Scott Petito, a musician and music producer.

The band signed a record contract with ESP-Disk in 1965. The Fugs said that &quot;our royalty rate was less than 3%, one of the lower percentages in the history of western civilization&quot;. The owner of the label, Bernard Stollman, has frequently faced accusation of not paying royalties to artists. In February 1967, the group was signed to Atlantic Records and recorded one album, &quot;The Fugs Eat It&quot;, but it was never released.

== Career ==
A satirical rock band with a political slant, the Fugs have performed at various war protests – against the Vietnam War and since the 1980s at events around other U.S. involved wars. The band&#x27;s often frank and humorous lyrics about sex, drugs, and politics occasionally generated hostile reactions, most notably from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the late 1960s. The group is referenced several times in the F.B.I. file on the Doors; an excerpt mentions eleven songs from &quot;The Fugs First Album&quot; that are &quot;vulgar and repulsive and are most suggestive&quot;.
In 1968, they toured Europe twice: in May to Denmark and Sweden where they wrote the song &quot;The Swedish Nada&quot; and played with Fleetwood Mac, Ten Years After, and The Nice; and in September to Germany where they played with Peter Brötzmann, Cuby and the Blizzards, Family, Guru Guru Groove, Alexis Korner, David Peel, Tangerine Dream, at the Internationale Essener Songtage in the Grugahalle in Essen.

In 1971, at a General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Fugs song was castigated by Ezra Taft Benson - a high-ranking elder who would go on to become its President. In a speech condemning rock music as Satanic, Benson said &quot;the cynic defends his degeneracy by ridiculing his critics with confusing metaphors.&quot; He complained that critiquing &quot;The words of the rock recording &#x27;I Couldn&#x27;t Get High,&#x27;&quot; caused people to call for the LDS hymn &#x27;High on the Mountain Top&#x27; to be dropped from songbooks. Benson disputed the retort that &#x27;If one sees filthy implications in a popular song, it is because he has a dirty mind,&#x27;&quot; saying &quot;No filth is [merely] implied in many of the lyrics. It is proclaimed.&quot;

In a 2012 interview with National Public Radio, Ed Sanders read a leaflet from an August 1965 show: &quot;The Fugs present: Night of napalm, songs against the war, rock n&#x27; roll bomb shrieks, heavy metal orgasms! Watch all The Fugs die in a napalm raid!&quot;

Their participation in the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam&#x27;s 1967 March on the Pentagon, at which they and others purportedly attempted to encircle and levitate the Pentagon, is chronicled in Norman Mailer&#x27;s book &quot;The Armies of the Night&quot;. A recording of this event is featured on the Fugs&#x27; 1968 album, &quot;Tenderness Junction,&quot; entitled &quot;Exorcising the Evil Spirits from the Pentagon Oct. 21, 1967&quot;. Beforehand, Sanders and Kupferberg had prepared an elaborate exorcism ritual, and rented a flatbed truck along with a sound system. As is heard on the album, the two gathered a large crowd in front of the Pentagon and repeatedly chanted, &quot;Out, demons, out!&quot;

One of their better-known songs is an adaptation of Matthew Arnold&#x27;s poem &quot;Dover Beach&quot;. Others were settings of William Blake&#x27;s poems &quot;Ah! Sun-flower&quot; and &quot;How Sweet I Roam&#x27;d&quot;. Another, &quot;Nothing&quot;, is a paraphrasing of the Yiddish folk song &quot;Bulbes&quot;.

After pursuing individual projects over the years, in 1984 Sanders and Kupferberg decided to re-form the band and stage a series of Fugs reunion concerts. On August 15, 1988, at the Byrdcliff Barn in Woodstock, New York, the Fugs performed one of their first real reunion concerts. This incarnation of the Fugs included, at various times, the guitarist and singer Steve Taylor (who was also Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s teaching assistant at the Naropa Institute), the drummer and singer Coby Batty, the bassist Mark Kramer, the guitarist Vinny Leary (who had contributed to the first two original Fugs albums), and the bassist and keyboardist Scott Petito. The re-formed Fugs performed concerts at numerous locations in the United States and Europe over the next several years.

In 1994 the band intended to perform a series of concerts in Woodstock, New York, (where Sanders had lived for many years) to commemorate the 1969 Woodstock Festival, which had actually occurred near the town of Bethel, some 50 miles away. They learned that a group of promoters were planning to stage Woodstock &#x27;94 that August near Saugerties, about 8 miles from Woodstock, and that this festival would be much more tightly controlled and commercialized than the original. Consequently, The Fugs decided to stage their own August 1994 concerts as &quot;The Real Woodstock Festival&quot;, in an atmosphere more in keeping with the spirit of the 1969 festival. The basic Fugs roster of Sanders, Kupferberg, Taylor, Batty, and Petito performed in this series of concerts with additional vocal support from Amy Fradon and Leslie Ritter and also with appearances by Allen Ginsberg and Country Joe McDonald. In 2003, the group released &quot;The Fugs Final CD (Part 1)&quot; with positive feedback. In 2004, The Fugs began to record &quot;Be Free: The Fugs Final CD (Part 2)&quot;.

In 2008 their song &quot;CIA Man&quot; was featured during the end credits for the movie &quot;Burn After Reading&quot;, directed by the Coen brothers. In 2009, Kupferberg suffered two strokes, the latter of which severely hindered his eyesight. He was under constant care, but was able to finish recording his tracks for &quot;Be Free&quot; in his New York City apartment. A benefit for Kupferberg was held in Brooklyn, New York, in February 2010, featuring all of the Fugs minus Kupferberg, as well as Lou Reed, Sonic Youth, Patti Smith Group guitarist Lenny Kaye, and others. &quot;Be Free: The Fugs Final CD (Part 2)&quot; was released on February 23, 2010. The album art, designed by Sanders, featured a snail reading Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poem &quot;Howl&quot;. The album was produced by Taylor and Sanders.

Kupferberg died on July 12, 2010, in Manhattan, at the age of 86. In 2008, in one of his last interviews, he told &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, &quot;Nobody who lived through the &#x27;50s thought the &#x27;60s could&#x27;ve existed. So there&#x27;s always hope.&quot;

The remaining Fugs from time to time seriously consider further performances. On June 11, 2011, the four remaining Fugs performed at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London as part of the annual Meltdown Festival, curated that year by Ray Davies of the Kinks. Their set received a four-star review in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

They performed at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland on November 30, 2012, and at the City Winery in Chicago on December 1, 2012. They performed at the Brooklyn Folk Festival on November 10, 2021.

== Film appearances ==
The band can be seen performing in the cult film &quot;Chappaqua&quot; (1967) by Conrad Rooks. Tuli Kupferberg made appearances in &quot;W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism&quot; (1971) by Dušan Makavejev and played God in &quot;Voulez-vous coucher avec God?&quot; (1972) by Michael Hirsh and Jack Christie.

Their song, &quot;CIA Man&quot;, can be heard during the closing credits of the 2008 Coen Brothers&#x27; film &quot;Burn After Reading&quot;, and during the closing credits of the fifth episode of the 2017 docudrama miniseries &quot;Wormwood&quot;.

<doc id="581412" wikidata="Q2606497" url="?curid=581412" title="Brompheniramine">
<text>Brompheniramine, sold under the brand name Dimetapp among others, is a first-generation antihistamine drug of the propylamine (alkylamine) class. It is indicated for the treatment of the symptoms of the common cold and allergic rhinitis, such as runny nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, and sneezing. Like the other first-generation drugs of its class, it is considered a sedating antihistamine.
It was patented in 1948 and came into medical use in 1955. In 2022, the combination with dextromethorphan and pseudoephedrine was the 265th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Side effects==
Brompheniramine&#x27;s effects on the cholinergic system may include side-effects such as drowsiness, sedation, dry mouth, dry throat, blurred vision, and increased heart rate. It is listed as one of the drugs of highest anticholinergic activity in a study of anticholinergenic burden, including long-term cognitive impairment.

==Pharmacology==
Brompheniramine works by acting as an antagonist of histamine H1 receptors. It also functions as a moderately effective anticholinergic agent, and is likely an antimuscarinic agent similar to other common antihistamines such as diphenhydramine.

Brompheniramine is metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the liver.

==Chemistry==
Brompheniramine is part of a series of antihistamines including pheniramine (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives and others including fluorpheniramine, chlorpheniramine, dexchlorpheniramine (Polaramine), triprolidine (Actifed), and iodopheniramine. The halogenated alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit optical isomerism; brompheniramine products contain racemic brompheniramine maleate, whereas dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral) is the dextrorotary (right-handed) stereoisomer.

Brompheniramine is an analog of chlorpheniramine. The only difference is that the chlorine atom in the benzene ring is replaced with a bromine atom. It is also synthesized in an analogous manner.

==History==
Arvid Carlsson and his colleagues, working at the Swedish company Astra AB, were able to derive the first marketed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, zimelidine, from brompheniramine.

==Names==
Brand names include Bromfed, Dimetapp, Bromfenex, Dimetane, and Lodrane. All bromphemiramine preparations are marketed as the maleate salt.

<doc id="581416" wikidata="Q14706225" url="?curid=581416" title="Chittenango Falls State Park">
<text>Chittenango Falls State Park is a state park located in Madison County, New York, east of Cazenovia Lake. The park features a waterfall that cascades over roughly 400-million-year-old bedrock. At the bottom of the falls Chittenango Creek flows underneath a wooden bridge. The park offers a variety of activities including picnic tables with pavilions, a playground, a nature trail, hiking, and fishing.

Approximately 45,000 visitors come to the park each year to engage in a variety of outdoor recreational activities. Although many camping guides still mistakenly list it as a campground, the park&#x27;s campground was closed in the mid-2000s.

Chittenango Falls State Park is also home to the endemic and endangered Chittenango ovate amber snail (&quot;Novisuccinea chittenangoensis&quot;).

Chittenango Falls once marked the boundary between the lands of the Oneida people and the Onondaga people. In 1784 the Oneidas called it “a Place where the Water runs over a Ledge of Rocks” when explaining their homeland’s boundaries to commissioners from New York.
==Trails and scenic viewing==
While the park is open year-round, the trail leading to the falls&#x27; viewing bridge is closed during winter months due to icy conditions. Views of the falls are still quite picturesque from the top however, with the ability to view the falls from the side of the creek or from a small viewing rail. On the opposite side of the creek, there is a steep uphill trail to the top of the falls opposite the entrance. Along that trail, there are several viewing spots.

<doc id="581417" wikidata="Q17084379" url="?curid=581417" title="Table of standard reduction potentials for half-reactions important in biochemistry">
<text>The values below are standard apparent reduction potentials for electro-biochemical half-reactions measured at 25 °C, 1 atmosphere and a pH of 7 in aqueous solution.

The actual physiological potential depends on the ratio of the reduced () and oxidized () forms according to the Nernst equation and the thermal voltage.

When an oxidizer () accepts a number &quot;z&quot; of electrons () to be converted in its reduced form (), the half-reaction is expressed as:

: + &quot;z&quot; → 

The reaction quotient (r) is the ratio of the chemical activity (&quot;a&quot;i) of the reduced form (the reductant, &quot;a&quot;Red) to the activity of the oxidized form (the oxidant, &quot;a&quot;ox). It is equal to the ratio of their concentrations (&quot;C&quot;i) only if the system is sufficiently diluted and the activity coefficients (&quot;γ&quot;i) are close to unity (&quot;a&quot;i = &quot;γ&quot;i &quot;C&quot;i):

: formula_1

The Nernst equation is a function of and can be written as follows:

formula_2

At chemical equilibrium, the reaction quotient of the product activity (&quot;a&quot;Red) by the reagent activity (&quot;a&quot;Ox) is equal to the equilibrium constant () of the half-reaction and in the absence of driving force () the potential () also becomes nul.

The numerically simplified form of the Nernst equation is expressed as:

:formula_3

Where formula_4 is the standard reduction potential of the half-reaction expressed versus the standard reduction potential of hydrogen. For standard conditions in electrochemistry (T = 25 °C, P = 1 atm and all concentrations being fixed at 1 mol/L, or 1 M) the standard reduction potential of hydrogen formula_5 is fixed at zero by convention as it serves of reference. The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), with [] = 1 M works thus at a pH = 0.

At pH = 7, when [] = 10−7 M, the reduction potential formula_6 of differs from zero because it depends on pH.

Solving the Nernst equation for the half-reaction of reduction of two protons into hydrogen gas gives:

: formula_7

: formula_8

In biochemistry and in biological fluids, at pH = 7, it is thus important to note that the reduction potential of the protons () into hydrogen gas is no longer zero as with the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at 1 M (pH = 0) in classical electrochemistry, but that formula_9 versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).

The same also applies for the reduction potential of oxygen:

For , formula_10 = 1.229 V, so, applying the Nernst equation for pH = 7 gives:

: formula_7

: formula_12

For obtaining the values of the reduction potential at pH = 7 for the redox reactions relevant for biological systems, the same kind of conversion exercise is done using the corresponding Nernst equation expressed as a function of pH.

The conversion is simple, but care must be taken not to inadvertently mix reduction potential converted at pH = 7 with other data directly taken from tables referring to SHE (pH = 0).

==Expression of the Nernst equation as a function of pH==

The formula_13 and pH of a solution are related by the Nernst equation as commonly represented by a Pourbaix diagram . For a half cell equation, conventionally written as a reduction reaction (&quot;i.e.&quot;, electrons accepted by an oxidant on the left side):

: formula_14

The half-cell standard reduction potential formula_10 is given by

: formula_16

where formula_17 is the standard Gibbs free energy change, is the number of electrons involved, and is Faraday&#x27;s constant. The Nernst equation relates pH and formula_13:

: formula_19  

where curly braces { } indicate activities, and exponents are shown in the conventional manner.This equation is the equation of a straight line for formula_13 as a function of pH with a slope of formula_21 volt (pH has no units).

This equation predicts lower formula_13 at higher pH values. This is observed for the reduction of O2 into H2O, or OH−, and for reduction of H+ into H2.

==Formal standard reduction potential combined with the pH dependency==
To obtain the reduction potential as a function of the measured concentrations of the redox-active species in solution, it is necessary to express the activities as a function of the concentrations.

: formula_19

Given that the chemical activity denoted here by { } is the product of the activity coefficient &quot;γ&quot; by the concentration denoted by [ ]: ai = &quot;γ&quot;i·Ci, here expressed as {X} = &quot;γ&quot;x [X] and {X}x = (&quot;γ&quot;x)x [X]x and replacing the logarithm of a product by the sum of the logarithms (&quot;i.e.&quot;, log (a·b) = log a + log b), the log of the reaction quotient (formula_24) (without {H+} already isolated apart in the last term as &quot;h&quot; pH) expressed here above with activities { } becomes:

: formula_25

It allows to reorganize the Nernst equation as:

: formula_26

: formula_27

Where formula_28 is the formal standard potential independent of pH including the activity coefficients.

Combining formula_28 directly with the last term depending on pH gives:

: formula_30

For a pH = 7:

: formula_31

So,

: formula_32

It is therefore important to know to what exact definition does refer the value of a reduction potential for a given biochemical redox process reported at pH = 7, and to correctly understand the relationship used.

Is it simply: 
* formula_33 calculated at pH 7 (with or without corrections for the activity coefficients), 
* formula_28, a formal standard reduction potential including the activity coefficients but no pH calculations, or, is it, 
* formula_35, an apparent formal standard reduction potential at pH 7 in given conditions and also depending on the ratio formula_36.
This requires thus to dispose of a clear definition of the considered reduction potential, and of a sufficiently detailed description of the conditions in which it is valid, along with a complete expression of the corresponding Nernst equation. Were also the reported values only derived from thermodynamic calculations, or determined from experimental measurements and under what specific conditions? Without being able to correctly answering these questions, mixing data from different sources without appropriate conversion can lead to errors and confusion.

==Determination of the formal standard reduction potential when 1==

The formal standard reduction potential formula_28 can be defined as the measured reduction potential formula_6 of the half-reaction at unity concentration ratio of the oxidized and reduced species (&quot;i.e.&quot;, when 1) under given conditions.

Indeed:

as, formula_39, when formula_40,

: formula_41, when formula_42,

because formula_43, and that the term formula_44 is included in formula_28.

The formal reduction potential makes possible to more simply work with molar or molal concentrations in place of activities. Because molar and molal concentrations were once referred as formal concentrations, it could explain the origin of the adjective &quot;formal&quot; in the expression &quot;formal&quot; potential.

The formal potential is thus the reversible potential of an electrode at equilibrium immersed in a solution where reactants and products are at unit concentration. If any small incremental change of potential causes a change in the direction of the reaction, &quot;i.e.&quot; from reduction to oxidation or &quot;vice versa&quot;, the system is close to equilibrium, reversible and is at its formal potential. When the formal potential is measured under standard conditions (&quot;i.e.&quot; the activity of each dissolved species is 1 mol/L, T = 298.15 K = 25 °C = 77 °F, = 1 bar) it becomes &quot;de facto&quot; a standard potential. According to Brown and Swift (1949), &quot;A formal potential is defined as the potential of a half-cell, measured against the standard hydrogen electrode, when the total concentration of each oxidation state is one formal&quot;.

The activity coefficients formula_46 and formula_47 are included in the formal potential formula_28, and because they depend on experimental conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, and pH, formula_28 cannot be referred as an immuable standard potential but needs to be systematically determined for each specific set of experimental conditions.

Formal reduction potentials are applied to simplify results interpretations and calculations of a considered system. Their relationship with the standard reduction potentials must be clearly expressed to avoid any confusion.

==Main factors affecting the formal (or apparent) standard reduction potentials==

The main factor affecting the formal (or apparent) reduction potentials formula_28 in biochemical or biological processes is the pH. To determine approximate values of formal reduction potentials, neglecting in a first approach changes in activity coefficients due to ionic strength, the Nernst equation has to be applied taking care to first express the relationship as a function of pH. The second factor to be considered are the values of the concentrations taken into account in the Nernst equation. To define a formal reduction potential for a biochemical reaction, the pH value, the concentrations values and the hypotheses made on the activity coefficients must always be clearly indicated. When using, or comparing, several formal (or apparent) reduction potentials they must also be internally consistent.

Problems may occur when mixing different sources of data using different conventions or approximations (&quot;i.e.&quot;, with different underlying hypotheses). When working at the frontier between inorganic and biological processes (e.g., when comparing abiotic and biotic processes in geochemistry when microbial activity could also be at work in the system), care must be taken not to inadvertently directly mix standard reduction potentials (formula_10 versus SHE, pH = 0) with formal (or apparent) reduction potentials (formula_52 at pH = 7). Definitions must be clearly expressed and carefully controlled, especially if the sources of data are different and arise from different fields (e.g., picking and directly mixing data from classical electrochemistry textbooks (formula_10 versus SHE, pH = 0) and microbiology textbooks (formula_52 at pH = 7) without paying attention to the conventions on which they are based).

==Example in biochemistry==
For example, in a two electrons couple like : the reduction potential becomes ~ 30 mV (or more exactly, 59.16 mV/2 = 29.6 mV) more positive for every power of ten increase in the ratio of the oxidised to the reduced form.

<text>Work colleges are colleges in the United States that require students to work and integrate that work into the college learning experience. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution with a commitment to community service. To qualify for Federal designation as a work college, at least half of the full-time students, including all students who reside on campus, must participate in a &quot;comprehensive work-learning-service&quot; program as an essential and core component of their educational programs, regardless of their academic program or their financial need. 

Students typically work 6 to 15 hours per week while enrolled. Their compensation helps offset the cost of tuition, and student labor can lower operational costs. Work colleges differ from need-based forms of financial support such as Federal Work Study, because students cannot &quot;buy&quot; their way out of the work requirement; participation is part of the educational experience. Students are regularly assessed on their work performance, and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance. Students typically work on campus, though some work colleges allow students to work at off-campus jobs.

There are nine federally recognized work colleges in the Work College Consortium, meeting the requirements for operation as overseen by the U.S. Department of Education.

*Alice Lloyd College in Pippa Passes, Kentucky
*Berea College in Berea, Kentucky
*Blackburn College in Carlinville, Illinois
*College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri
*Kuyper College in Grand Rapids, Michigan
*Paul Quinn College in Dallas, Texas
*Sterling College in Craftsbury Common, Vermont
*Warren Wilson College in Asheville, North Carolina

There is also one two-year work college:
*Deep Springs College, California, limited to 26 students

==Predecessors==
A predecessor of the work college is the manual labor college movement of the 1820s up to about 1860. It also combined work, usually agricultural or mechanical, with preparatory or college study, often preparation for the ministry. Although it helped students financially, equally if not more important were the work&#x27;s perceived healthful effects on the bodies and minds of the students.

<doc id="581422" wikidata="Q6759831" url="?curid=581422" title="Margaret Reid (politician)">
<text>Margaret Elizabeth Reid (née McLachlan; born 28 May 1935) is an Australian former politician who served as a Senator for the Australian Capital Territory from 1981 to 2003, representing the Liberal Party. She held her seat for nearly 22 years, winning eight consecutive elections. Reid is the first woman to have served as President of the Senate.

==Early years==
Born Margaret Elizabeth McLachlan on 28 May 1935 in Crystal Brook, South Australia, Reid was educated at Balaklava Primary School, Methodist Ladies&#x27; College and the University of Adelaide, where she was president of the debating society. The speeches of Prime Minister Robert Menzies stirred her interest in politics and she joined the Liberal Party in 1954 and became president of the Adelaide University Liberal Club, the Australian Universities Liberal Federation, and the South Australia Young Liberals. She graduated from the University of Adelaide with a law degree in 1959.

==Legal career==
Reid was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in the Supreme Court of South Australia in 1960 and worked in a family law practice in Adelaide.

In 1961, Reid ran as the Liberal candidate for the Division of Bonython, a Labor Party stronghold in South Australia. Her campaign improved upon the previous Liberal vote, though she later admitted she had &quot;no possibility of winning&quot;.

In 1965, Reid moved to Canberra to join the law firm of Davies Bailey and Carter, initially in the fields of workers&#x27; compensation and third-party litigation before returning to family law. She worked at the firm until 1981.

==Political career==

===Party work and first term===
Reid was active with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Liberal Party and held a number of senior positions, including election to party president in 1976. While continuing to practise law, Reid worked for Liberal Party Senator John Knight, the first senator for the ACT. 

When Knight died in office in March 1981, Reid stepped forward as one of ten candidates hoping to fill the casual vacancy. The ACT Liberal Party endorsed Reid to replace Knight over other candidates including experienced politicians John Haslem and Greg Cornwell. On 5 May 1981, Reid was appointed to the senate by a joint sitting of the Parliament of Australia.

During her first term, Reid served as chair of the Joint Committee on the ACT, successfully petitioned the prime minister to establish a Cabinet sub-committee on the ACT, and was elected Deputy Whip in the senate. Reid has stated that she took this role because it was only active while Parliament was in session, and did not seek a ministry or position on a major standing committee as such would limit the time she could work with her electorate, which in turn could affect her chances at re-election.

The Liberal–National Coalition government was defeated by Labor in the 1983 federal election. Reid failed to secure a quota and had to wait two weeks for the Electoral Office to confirm her victory.

===Opposition Whip===
For thirteen years while the Liberals were in opposition, Reid continued to hold her senate seat through three elections. She served as Opposition Deputy Whip and, from 1987 to 1995, Opposition Whip. She continued to serve on the Joint Standing Committee on the ACT, and also served on committees examining the &quot;Family Law Act&quot; and related issues; Senate estimates; transport, communications and infrastructure; legislation procedures; and the Australian Archives. Reid took part in major international government conferences including those of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) and on Parliamentary delegations.

Reid became Deputy President and Chair of Committees (Senate) in July 1995, after Noel Crichton-Browne was forced to resign from the position due to allegations of domestic violence. Crichton-Browne had been poised to take the Senate Presidency on a Liberal–National Coalition victory in the 1996 election; in his absence, Reid was seen as a replacement that party members could work with. On 20 August 1996 she became the first woman President of the Senate.

===Senate President===
Reid served as President of the Senate for a six-year term from 1996 to 2002. In the role, she often chaired committees, represented the parliament at international conferences and led parliamentary delegations abroad. She was president of the CPA and worked to promote democracy in developing nations. She worked on committees examining the broadcast of parliamentary sessions; parliamentary procedure; the parliamentary library; and appropriations and staffing. During her term as Senate President, Reid was re-elected twice, including her most-difficult contest in 1998, when the federal Liberal Party had lost popularity in the ACT. She received a final vote of 34.1 per cent over a quota of 33.4 per cent. The Democrats considered an appeal to the Court of Disputed Returns due to last-day campaign irregularities but ultimately did not pursue this.

In 2002, Reid lost party support as the Senate President in a contest with Alan Ferguson and Liberal whip Paul Calvert, with Calvert ultimately chosen to succeed her. Reid retired from politics on 14 February 2003 after 22 years as a senator for the ACT.

==Personal life==
Shortly after moving to Canberra, Reid met Tom Reid at a Christmas party. They married in 1967, and Reid adopted and helped raise his four children. By 2001, they had seven grandchildren. Tom Reid died in 2010.

==Honours and awards==
*1977 Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal (Australia)
*1987 Order of Polonia Restituta (Poland)
*1996 Honorary Life Membership of the Returned and Services League of Australia
*2003 Centenary Medal
*2004 Officer of the Order of Australia for her service to the Australian Parliament and the community.
*2006 Honorary doctorate, Charles Sturt University
*Liberal Party Distinguished Service Award

<doc id="581425" wikidata="Q3319082" url="?curid=581425" title="Thomas MacDonagh">
<text>Thomas Stanislaus MacDonagh (; 1 February 1878 – 3 May 1916) was an Irish political activist, poet, playwright, educationalist and revolutionary leader. He was one of the seven leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916, a signatory of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and Commandant of the 2nd Battalion, Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers, which fought in Jacob&#x27;s biscuit factory. He was executed for his part in the Rising at the age of thirty-eight.

MacDonagh was assistant headmaster at St. Enda&#x27;s School, Scoil Éanna, and lecturer in English at University College Dublin. He was a member of the Gaelic League, where he befriended Patrick Pearse and Eoin MacNeill. He was a founding member of the Irish Volunteers with MacNeill and Pearse. He wrote poetry and plays. His play, &quot;When the Dawn is Come&quot;, was produced by the Abbey Theatre in 1908. Other plays include &quot;Metempsychosis&quot;, 1912 and &quot;Pagans&quot;, 1915, both produced by the Irish Theatre Company.

==Early life==
He was born Cloughjordan, County Tipperary, to Joseph McDonagh, a schoolmaster, and Mary Parker. He grew up in a household filled with music, poetry and learning and was instilled with a love of both English and Irish culture from a young age. His brothers included future Sinn Féin politician, Joseph, and film director John.

Both his parents were teachers; who strongly emphasised education. MacDonagh attended Rockwell College. While there MacDonagh spent several years as a scholastic, sometimes a preparation for a missionary career, however, after a few years he realised that it wasn&#x27;t the life for him, and left. Very soon after, he published his first book of poems, &quot;Through the Ivory Gate&quot;, in 1902. He taught in St Kieran&#x27;s College in Kilkenny and from 1903 he was employed as a professor of French, English and Latin at St. Colman&#x27;s College, Fermoy, County Cork, where he also formed a branch of the Gaelic League. While in Fermoy, MacDonagh was one of the founding members of ASTI, the secondary teachers trade union which was formed in the Fermoy College in 1908. He moved to Dublin, soon establishing strong friendships with such men as Eoin MacNeill and Patrick Pearse.

==Teaching==
His friendship with Pearse and his love of Irish led him to join the staff of Pearse&#x27;s bilingual St. Enda&#x27;s School upon its establishment in 1908, taking the role of French and English teacher and Assistant Headmaster. He was one of the founders of the teachers&#x27; trade union ASTI (Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland). MacDonagh was essential to the school&#x27;s early success, on his marriage he took the position of lecturer in English at the National University, while continuing to support St Enda&#x27;s. MacDonagh remained devoted to the Irish language, and in 1910 he became tutor to a younger member of the Gaelic League, Joseph Plunkett. The two were both poets with an interest in the Irish Theatre and formed a lifelong friendship.

On 3 January 1912 he married Muriel Gifford (a member of the Church of Ireland, though neither she nor he was a churchgoer); their son, Donagh, was born that November, and their daughter, Barbara, in March 1915. Muriel&#x27;s sister, Grace Gifford, was to marry Joseph Mary Plunkett hours before his execution in 1916.

MacDonagh was a member of the Irish Women&#x27;s Franchise League. He supported the strikers during the Dublin lockout and was a member of the &quot;Industrial Peace Committee&quot; alongside Joseph Plunkett, whose stated aim was to achieve a fair outcome to the dispute.

==Republicanism==
In 1913 both MacDonagh and Plunkett attended the inaugural meeting of the Irish Volunteers and joined its Provisional Committee. MacDonagh was later appointed Commandant of Dublin&#x27;s 2nd Battalion and eventually made commandant of the entire Dublin Brigade. Although originally a pure constitutionalist, through his dealings with men such as Pearse, Plunkett, and Seán Mac Diarmada, and through the increasing militarisation of Europe in the onset of World War I, MacDonagh developed stronger republican beliefs, joining the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), probably during the summer of 1915. Around this time Tom Clarke asked him to plan the grandiose funeral of Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa, which was a resounding propaganda success, largely due to the graveside oration delivered by Pearse.

==Easter Rising==

Though credited as one of the Easter Rising&#x27;s seven leaders, MacDonagh was a late addition to that group. He didn&#x27;t join the secret Military Council that planned the rising until April 1916, weeks before the rising took place. The reason for his admittance at such a late date is uncertain. Still a relative newcomer to the IRB, men such as Clarke may have been hesitant to elevate him to such a high position too soon, which raises the question as to why he should be admitted at all. His close ties to Pearse and Plunkett may have been the cause, as well as his position as commandant of the Dublin Brigade (though his position as such would later be superseded by James Connolly as commandant-general of the Dublin division). Nevertheless, MacDonagh was a signatory of the Proclamation of the Republic.

During the rising, MacDonagh&#x27;s battalion was stationed at the massive complex of Jacob&#x27;s Biscuit Factory. On the way to this destination the battalion encountered the veteran Fenian, John MacBride, who on the spot joined the battalion as second-in-command, and in fact took over part of the command throughout Easter Week, although he had had no prior knowledge and was in the area by accident. MacDonagh&#x27;s original second in command was Michael O&#x27;Hanrahan.

As it was, despite MacDonagh&#x27;s rank and the fact that he commanded one of the strongest battalions, they saw little fighting, as the British Army avoided the factory as they established positions in central Dublin. MacDonagh received the order to surrender on 30 April, though his entire battalion was fully prepared to continue the engagement. Following the surrender, MacDonagh was court martialled, and executed by firing squad on 3 May 1916, aged thirty-eight. He was the 3rd signatory of the Proclamation to be shot. It is said that as he was taken from his cell to be executed he whistled.

His widow, Muriel, died of heart failure while swimming in Skerries, County Dublin on 9 July 1917; his son Donagh MacDonagh became a judge, and was also a prominent poet, Broadway playwright, songwriter and broadcaster, a central member of the Irish literary revival of the 1940s/1960s. He married Nuala Smyth and they had four children. His daughter Barbara married the actor Liam Redmond and they had four children. During the 1950s and 1960s, she wrote many scripts for Radio Éireann, the Irish national radio broadcaster, using her husband&#x27;s more famous name.

==Reputation and commemoration==
MacDonagh was generally credited with being one of the most gregarious and personable of the Rising&#x27;s leaders. Geraldine Plunkett Dillon, a sister of Joseph Plunkett gives a contemporary description of him in her book &quot;All in the Blood&quot;: &quot;As soon as Tomás came into our house everyone was a friend of his. He had a pleasant, intelligent face and was always smiling, and you had the impression that he was always thinking about what you were saying.&quot; In Mary Colum&#x27;s &quot;Life and the Dream&quot;, she writes of hearing about the Rising from America, where she was living with her husband, Pádraic Colum, remembering Tomás MacDonagh saying to her: &quot;This country will be one entire slum unless we get into action, in spite of our literary movements and Gaelic Leagues it is going down and down. There is no life or heart left in the country.&quot;

A prominent figure in the Dublin literary world, he was commemorated in several poems by W.B. Yeats. Yeats most famous nationalist poem &quot;Easter 1916&quot; makes an allusion to MacDonagh as a friend of Pearse: &quot;This other his helper and friend/ Was coming into his force/ He might have won fame in the end/ So sensitive his nature seemed/ So daring and sweet his thought&quot;. His friend Francis Ledwidge&#x27;s &quot;Lament for Thomas MacDonagh&quot; also commemorates him. In a poem rich with allegory – &quot;the Dark Cow&quot; () is an 18th-century symbol of Ireland, for instance – Ledwidge wrote:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;&#x27;He shall not hear the bittern cry&quot;
&quot;In the wild sky, where he is lain,&quot;
&quot;Nor voices of the sweeter birds&quot;
&quot;Above the wailing of the rain&quot;
&quot;Nor shall he know when loud March blows 
&quot;Thro’ slanting snows her fanfare shrill,
&quot;Blowing to flame the golden cup
&quot;Of many an upset daffodil.
&quot;But when the Dark Cow leaves the moor&quot;
&quot;And pastures poor with greedy weeds,&quot;
&quot;Perhaps he&#x27;ll hear her low at morn,&quot;
&quot;Lifting her horn in pleasant meads.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Thomas MacDonagh Tower in Ballymun, Dublin, which was built in the 1960s and demolished in June 2005, was named after him. 
MacDonagh had taught in St Kieran&#x27;s College, Kilkenny City during the early years of his career, where MacDonagh Railway Station was named in his memory, as was the MacDonagh Junction shopping centre.

The Thomas MacDonagh Heritage Centre in Cloughjordan, County Tipperary was opened in 2013. The centre houses the town library and exhibition space. An annual Thomas MacDonagh Summer School takes place in Cloughjordan over the May bank holiday weekend.

Gaelic Athletic Association clubs and grounds named after MacDonagh have been established in County Tipperary (Kilruane, Nenagh and a North Tipperary amalgamation).

The McDonagh Barracks group of buildings represents one of the largest individual components of the Curragh Camp in Kildare. The nearby pitch &amp; putt also bears his name.

As MacDonough was a founding member, the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (ASTI) awards the &#x27;Thomas MacDonough Medal&#x27; for &quot;extraordinary service to the union by members&quot;.

<text>Sir George Prevost, 1st Baronet (19 May 1767 – 5 January 1816) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator who is most well known as the &quot;Defender of Canada&quot; during the War of 1812. Born in New Jersey, the eldest son of Genevan Augustine Prévost, he joined the British Army as a youth and became a captain in 1784. Prevost served in the West Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and was commander of St. Vincent from 1794 to 1796. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Lucia from 1798 to 1802 and Governor of Dominica from 1802 to 1805. He is best known to history for serving as both the civilian Governor General and the military Commander in Chief in British North America (now part of Canada) during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States.

==Early life==
George Prevost was born on 19 May 1767, in New Barbadoes Township (now Hackensack), New Jersey. His father was Augustin Prévost (1723–1786), a French-speaking Protestant from the Republic of Geneva, and a lieutenant-colonel in the British Army. His mother was Anne Francoise Marguerite &quot;Nanette&quot; Grand. George Prevost was educated at schools in England and in the North American continent.

==Early military career==

===1779–1790===
On 3 May 1779, Prevost was commissioned at the age of eleven, as an ensign in the 60th Regiment of Foot, in which his father was a senior officer. In 1782, he transferred to the 47th Regiment of Foot, as a lieutenant, followed in 1784 by a move to the 25th Regiment of Foot as a captain. He then returned to the 60th Foot on 18 November 1790 with the rank of major, at the age of 23. Prevost&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a wealthy banker in Amsterdam, and his money is considered to have certainly been responsible for his grandson&#x27;s quick advancement up the chain of command in the British Army, as promotion could then be obtained &quot;by purchase&quot;.

===1791–mid-1802===
While serving in the 60th, Prevost was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 6 August 1794. He was stationed in St Vincent from 1794–1795. During fighting on 20 January 1796, he was wounded twice, and he returned to England shortly after, where he was appointed to become an inspecting field officer. On 1 January 1798, Prevost became a colonel, and on 8 March he became a brigadier-general, at the age of 30. In May he was appointed to be the lieutenant governor of St Lucia, where his fluency in French and conciliatory administration won him the respect of the French planters living there. In 1802, he returned to Britain as a result of ill health.

===Late 1802–1806===
On 27 September 1802, soon after fighting against France resumed, Prevost was chosen to be the Governor of Dominica. In 1803, the French attempted to seize the island, and Prevost fought against them. He would also fight against the French in an effort to reclaim St Lucia. On 1 January 1805, at the age of 37, Prevost was promoted to major-general, and soon after he was granted leave to return to England, where he became Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth and General Officer Commanding South-West District in December 1805, and where he was appointed to be a baronet. In 1806, Prevost became a colonel commandant of his regiment.

==Service as Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia==

On 15 January 1808, Prevost was appointed to become the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, and he was also promoted to lieutenant-general, although this was a rank that he held only in Nova Scotia. He was tasked with improving the military defences of the Atlantic colonies. He arrived at Halifax on 7 April 1808 and by the end of April he had taken steps to increase opposition in New England to the American government&#x27;s hostile attitude towards Britain. The President of the United States of America in 1808, Thomas Jefferson, had placed an embargo on American trading with Britain. From 1808, to the beginning of the War of 1812, Prevost tried to encourage New England to trade with Britain by setting up &quot;free ports&quot; in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where American goods could be landed without a need to pay customs duties. This led to a substantial increase in Nova Scotia&#x27;s trade not only with New England, but also with the West Indies. Prevost could do little to improve the sub-standard fortifications in Nova Scotia, but was able to secure the approval of the legislature in Nova Scotia to amend a militia law, which led to Prevost&#x27;s ability to mobilize a small, effective militia force to work with the regular garrison during an emergency.

The amendment of the law is considered to be a good achievement by Prevost, because his predecessor as lieutenant governor, John Wentworth, had been responsible for relations between the executive and legislative bodies of Nova Scotia weakening. Wentworth had tried to increase his own executive power at the expense of the legislative House of Assembly. When Prevost arrived, the House of Assembly, led by William Cottnam Tonge, was struggling to control government expenditures. In an effort to appease Tonge, Prevost appointed him to be his second-in-command during an expedition against Martinique.

=== Invasion of Martinique (1809) ===

They departed from Halifax on 6 December 1808. Unfortunately, Tonge’s departure did not lead to a peaceful relationship between the House of Assembly and the executive body as Prevost’s replacement during his absence, Alexander Croke, fought with the Assembly over a supply bill. Eventually, Croke rejected the bill on the basis that it did not fit in with royal prerogatives, and then could not reach an agreement with the Legislative Council over how to settle the dispute between himself and the Assembly.

Martinique was captured, and Prevost returned to Halifax on 15 April 1809. Tonge did not return, as he decided to stay in the West Indies. Prevost opposed Croke’s actions, restored &quot;good understanding&quot; with the Legislative Council, and then calmed the Assembly by deciding not to follow the constitution of Nova Scotia down to the letter. On 10 June 1808, the House of Assembly passed the supply bill, and also voted to use 200 guineas to purchase a sword for Prevost as a sign of their approval for Prevost&#x27;s conduct during the expedition against Martinique. Prevost believed he had successfully maintained the crown&#x27;s prerogative. In 1809, using his good relationship with the Assembly, he was able to secure a tax on distilled liquors, with the proceeds of which he could pay the cost of equipment for the provincial militia. For the rest of his term as lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia, Prevost ensured he did not make an executive act that the Assembly would oppose to a great degree.

Prevost had become a popular lieutenant governor, but this was threatened by his attempts, beginning in 1810, to strengthen the Church of England in Nova Scotia, since that might alienate other religious groups. He persuaded the British government to allow him to use surplus arms funds to develop Anglican churches, and to enlarge King&#x27;s College in Windsor. He also appointed Anglican clergy to be civil magistrates, protected the Anglican ownership of land and their influence over the education of children, and placed an Anglican bishop in the Legislative Council. On the condition that the bishop resided in Halifax, Prevost was able to increase the salary of the bishop. In an effort to appease other religious groups, he appointed a number of Roman Catholic and Presbyterian clergy to be magistrates, and he authorized a grant of money for the Church of Scotland.

During May 1811, when Prevost was preparing to oppose the Assembly over its policy of compensating its members for their expenses, feeling that it was irregular, open to abuse, and &quot;an evil highly dangerous to the prerogative of the Crown&quot;, he was ordered to move to Lower Canada to replace Governor Craig.

==Service as Governor-in-Chief of British North America==

On 4 July 1811, Prevost became a lieutenant-general outside of Nova Scotia, and was appointed as commander-in-chief of British forces in North America. On 21 October, he was appointed to be the governor-in-chief of British North America (&quot;Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over the Provinces of Upper-Canada, Lower-Canada, Nova Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty’s Forces in the said Provinces of Lower-Canada and Upper-Canada, Nova Scotia and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, and in the islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, Cape Breton and the Bermudas, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&quot; Beneath Prevost, the staff of the British Army in &quot;the Provinces of Nova-Scotia, New-Brunswick, and their Dependencies, including the Islands of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Prince Edward and Bermuda&quot; were under the Command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. Below Sherbrooke, the Bermuda Garrison was under the immediate control of the Governor of Bermuda, Major-General George Horsford). As commander-in-chief, he took over the presidency and administration of Lower Canada from Thomas Dunn on 14 September. He would remain the president of Lower Canada until 15 July 1812. During his time as commander-in-chief, he was focused on ensuring the military security of the Atlantic colonies.

Prevost was worried about the disposition of Canadians if a war started involving British North America and tried to conciliate Canadian political leaders, who had been disappointed by the partisan alliance between Craig and the British oligarchy. The leader of the Canadian party, Pierre-Stanislas Bédard, was opposed by several people trying to gain his position, and Prevost exploited the rivalry. In 1812, Bédard, losing his motivation for continuing as leader, was given a judgeship in an area of British North America from which he could not have a major influence over the general political system. Prevost worked with the moderate Louis-Joseph Papineau, treating him as the leader. Prevost also nominated five Canadians to be appointed to the Legislative Council between 1811 and 1815, an unusual move as Canadians had usually been excluded from being appointed since 1798. In a report to the Colonial Office, Prevost said that he wanted to create a Legislative Council &quot;possessed of the consideration of the country, from a majority of its members being independent of the government&quot;, in order to transfer to it &quot;the political altercations which have been hitherto carried on by the governor in person.&quot;
===War of 1812===
For most of the War, Prevost&#x27;s strategy was defensive and cautious. Learning in August 1812 that the British government had repealed some of the Orders in Council (1807) which the United States regarded as a cause of war, he negotiated an armistice with commanding General Henry Dearborn, but President James Madison soon repudiated Dearborn&#x27;s agreement and the war resumed. During the early months of 1813, Prevost twice visited Upper Canada where the military and civil situation was unsatisfactory after the Governor and Commander there (Major General Isaac Brock) had been killed in action. As a result, he was present in Kingston in May, and took personal charge of an attack on the main American naval base on Lake Ontario. A victory here could have been decisive but the expedition was hastily mounted and at the Battle of Sackett&#x27;s Harbor both Prevost and the naval commander, Commodore James Lucas Yeo, attacked hesitantly. After meeting stiff resistance, they withdrew.

In 1814, large reinforcements became available after the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. Prevost was appointed Colonel of the 16th, Bedfordshire Regiment in April. He planned an attack along Lake Champlain and the Hudson River, but the army which he led personally was driven back at the Battle of Plattsburgh after the British naval squadron on Lake Champlain was defeated. Commodore Yeo considered that the British ships under Captain George Downie (who was killed in the action) had been ordered into action prematurely by Prevost, and that Prevost had failed to order an attack by his own troops until it was too late to avert the defeat of Downie&#x27;s squadron.

Prevost had also made himself unpopular among some of the Army officers under his command who were veterans of the Peninsular War (such as Manley Power, Thomas Brisbane, and Frederick Philipse Robinson) by his perceived over-caution, and his niggling insistence on correct dress and uniform. He had also alienated several successful Canadian officers (such as Charles de Salaberry) by seeming to claim their successes for himself and failing to reward them properly. However, it was the complaints by the Navy and Peninsular veterans which prompted his recall. Although the Duke of Wellington accepted that Prevost&#x27;s strategy was correct, he wrote on 30 October 1814,
It is very obvious to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general officers I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.

In December, Wellington&#x27;s former Quartermaster General, Sir George Murray, was sent to Canada with the local rank of Lieutenant General specifically to order Prevost to return to London to explain his conduct of the Plattsburg campaign. He delivered the order on 2 March 1815, by coincidence only a day or so after news of the ratification of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, arrived in Quebec. Prevost felt himself publicly humiliated by the manner and timing of his succession. After ordering hostilities to cease and disbanding the militia, he left Quebec on 3 April. He was given a hasty vote of thanks by the Assembly in Quebec.

==Later life==

On his return to England, the Government and Army authorities at first accepted Prevost&#x27;s explanations for his conduct at Plattsburgh and during the War generally. Soon afterwards, the official naval despatch on the Battle of Plattsburgh was published, together with Yeo&#x27;s complaints. Both these accounts blamed Prevost for the defeat at Plattsburgh. Prevost requested a court martial to clear his name. The trial was set for 12 January 1816, the delay being necessary to allow witnesses to travel from Canada, but Prevost was already in ill health and died a week before it was due to convene. His widow declined the offer of a peerage in honour of her husband, as she did not consider herself and her family to have sufficient means to support the dignity.

Later historians judge Prevost&#x27;s preparations for defending the Canadas with limited means to be energetic, well conceived, and comprehensive, and against the odds he had achieved the primary objective of preventing an American conquest.

Prevost is buried in the church of St Mary the Virgin, East Barnet, North London, England.

==Honours==
A schooner was named in his honour in 1813.

In 1819 a monument to his memory, sculpted by Francis Chantrey, was erected in Winchester Cathedral.

In 2016, Prevost was named a National Historic Person by the Canadian government.

<doc id="581431" wikidata="Q7922351" url="?curid=581431" title="Verona Beach State Park">
<text>Verona Beach State Park is a state park located on the eastern shore of Oneida Lake in the Town of Verona, Oneida County, New York. The park is located on NY 13 northwest of the City of Oneida and south of Sylvan Beach. Oneida Creek enters the Oneida Lake south of the park.

==History==
Prior to being purchased by New York State in the 1940s, much of the area that would become the park was a privately owned tract known as Nabor&#x27;s Grove. Many large trees were preserved under private ownership, contributing to the mature forest that is found on much of the park&#x27;s property today.

In 1944, the New York State Council of Parks approved the initial acquisition of land for Verona Beach State Park. By 1962, 59 lots comprising had been purchased at a cost of $276,300. The final acres, purchased in 1969–70, increased the park&#x27;s size to for a total cost of $288,888 or roughly $166 per acre.

The park is operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (Central Region).

==Facilities==

The park, set on along the eastern shore of Oneida Lake and featuring a diverse wetland habitat, offers facilities for a variety of outdoor activities.

The park offers a long supervised beach, bathhouse, concession stand, an enclosed picnic pavilion and three picnic shelters, 46 campsites with a recreation building, and numerous picnic sites. There are of nature trails for hiking and of horseback and mountain bike trails which become cross-country ski and snowmobile trails during the winter. Hunting for deer, small game, and waterfowl is also permitted, as is fishing and ice fishing.

In 2013, $4.3 million in improvements were announced for Verona Beach State Park, including a new bathhouse, a new food concession, an enclosed picnic pavilion, three picnic shelters to replace the park&#x27;s temporary rental tents, and a reconstructed parking area.

The park has about 35 seasonal employees. It is open for daily use through Labor Day, after which the beach is closed, although the campgrounds are open through Columbus Day in October and hiking trails remain open year-round. Daily use fee is $7 per car. The beach is open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily during the summer months.

<doc id="581432" wikidata="Q7623016" url="?curid=581432" title="Street layout of Seattle">
<text>The street layout of Seattle is based on a series of disjointed rectangular street grids. Most of Seattle and King County use a single street grid, oriented on true north. Near the center of the city, various land claims were platted in the 19th century with differently oriented grids, which still survive today. Distinctly oriented grids also exist in some cities annexed by Seattle in the early 20th century, such as Ballard and Georgetown. A small number of streets and roads are exceptions to the grid pattern.

==Street grid layout==

Most streets in Seattle run either north–south or east–west. However, this orientation does not prevail in one of the oldest and densest parts of the town, bounded by Elliott Bay to the west, Broadway to the east, Yesler Way to the south, and Denny Way to the north. That exceptional area includes all of the Downtown Central Business District (CBD), the northernmost part of the Pioneer Square neighborhood south of the CBD, First Hill east of the CBD, and Belltown and the Denny Regrade north of the CBD.

The grid is oriented 32 degrees west of north in the southern portion of that exceptional area, and 49 degrees west of north in the northern portion. The two portions are divided by a line that runs along Stewart Street (or its right-of-way) from Alaskan Way on the Central Waterfront east to 3rd Avenue, then along Olive Way from 3rd Avenue to 7th Avenue, and along Howell Street from 7th Avenue to Denny Way.

===Origins===
These three grid patterns (due north, 32 degrees west of north, and 49 degrees west of north) are the result of a disagreement between David Swinson &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard, whose land claim lay south of Yesler Way, and Arthur A. Denny and Carson D. Boren, whose land claims lay to the north (with Henry Yesler and his mill soon brought in between Denny and the others): Denny and Boren preferred that their streets follow the Elliott Bay shoreline, while Maynard favored a grid based on the cardinal directions for his (mostly flat, mostly wet) claim. All three were competing to have the downtown built on their land. Denny prevailed in what would become the central business district, but it was Maynard&#x27;s grid that ended up being extended throughout the city and into all of King County (60 miles east to west). Several cities in King County, such as Renton, Kirkland, and North Bend, have their own naming system and grid in the center of town, but Maynard&#x27;s Pioneer Square–based grid officially covers the entire county.

==Addressing==
Street addresses in Seattle (and throughout much of King County) follow a uniform numbering plan. On roads that run north and south [generally called an &quot;Avenue&quot;], odd numbered addresses are on the west side and even numbered addresses are on the east side. On roads that run east and west [generally called a &quot;Street&quot;], odd numbered addresses are on the south side and even numbered addresses are on the north side. The address is based on its location relative to the grid (not relative to the location of the beginning of each separate road, or its nearest intersection) with the last two digits consecutively incrementing with the grid and the leading digits designating the location on the grid.

Some mnemonics are helpful here:
* STreets run eaST and weST
* aveNueS run North and South
* EveN numbered addresses are on the East and North side of the road (which is likely called a &quot;street&quot; or &quot;avenue&quot;)

The name &quot;32nd Avenue NE&quot; applies to several physically discontinuous street segments running along approximately the same line of the grid. One of these segments runs from NE 75th Street to NE 80th Street, crossed only by NE 77th Street; its two blocks are the 7500 block and the 7700 block. Buildings on that street between 75th and 77th would have four-digit addresses beginning with 75; buildings above 77th would have four-digit addresses beginning with 77. If there is such an address as 7764 32nd Avenue NE, then it is on the east side of the street rather far up the 7700 block, and if there is a 7765 it will be approximately across the street from 7764.

North of the ship canal in Seattle, and north of NE 140th St in East King County, grid numbers are spread in increments by 20 per mile (which works out to one numerical block per minute when walking at 3 miles per hour). In much of the rest of King County (south of NE 140th St, and east of 68th Ave NE at the north end of Lake Washington), grid numbers are spread in increments 16 per mile (which works out to 10 per kilometer). Due to the regular spacing of street numbers, approximate distances between two points on the grid can be easily calculated.

A few older cities within King County have their own distinct numbering plan, centered on their own historic downtown areas, including much of Renton and historic parts of Kirkland. In Kirkland, streets and avenues run perpendicular to the usual King County designations. In Renton (east of I-405), avenues are named for Washington State communities and arranged in alphabetical order (Aberdeen, Blaine, Camas, etc.).

In Seattle, the names of the twelve streets in the heart of the central business district are paired by their first letters. From south to north, they are: Jefferson, James, Cherry, Columbia, Marion, Madison, Spring, Seneca, University, Union, Pike, Pine. One way to remember the order of the street pairs is with the mnemonic &quot;Jesus Christ Made Seattle Under Protest&quot; (or &quot;Pressure&quot;) (JCMSUP). 

Only one street in Seattle, Madison Street, runs uninterrupted from the salt water of Puget Sound in the west to the fresh water of Lake Washington in the east. The unusual orientation and contiguous nature of this street dates back to a time when it was a direct route to a cross-lake ferry between Madison Park and Houghton on the east side of Lake Washington. A cable car once operated on Madison Street from downtown Seattle to the ferry terminal at Madison Park, and the ferry route constituted an almost linear continuation of the street across the lake. Other historical cable cars ran along Yesler Way, Jackson Street, Queen Anne Avenue—&quot;The Counterbalance&quot;, and 1st Avenue-2nd Avenue). No street, excluding Interstate 5 and State Route 99—both freeways in whole or in part—runs without interruption from the northern to the southern city limits. This is largely the result of Seattle&#x27;s topography. Split by the Duwamish River and the Lake Washington Ship Canal, containing four lakes within the city limits, and boasting deep ravines and at least seven hills there are few more-or-less straight routes where such a road could reasonably be built, even allowing for the short bridge or two.

==Directionals==

Seattle and King County make systematic use of directionals (such as N for north or NE for northeast) in street names, although residents often omit the directionals when describing addresses in their own neighborhoods. To a lesser degree, street types such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; are also used systematically. As a rule, &quot;streets&quot; run east–west (or, in and near downtown, northeast–southwest), and &quot;avenues&quot; run north–south (or, in and near downtown, northwest–southeast). A &quot;road&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;way&quot;, or thoroughfare with any other type designation may run in any direction. The land boundaries of the district laid out according to the Denny and Boren plats that follow the shoreline are all &quot;Ways&quot; (Denny Way, Yesler Way, Broadway).

Furthermore:
* &quot;Streets&quot; and other east–west thoroughfares &quot;prefix&quot; the directional; for example &quot;NE 45th Street&quot;.
* &quot;Avenues&quot; and other north–south thoroughfares &quot;suffix&quot; the directional; for example &quot;15th Avenue NE&quot;, &quot;University Way NE&quot;.
* A mnemonic for directionals is that the general direction of a thoroughfare is the direction nearer its name or number; for example NE 45th Street runs generally east (and west), while University Way NE runs generally north (and south).
* &quot;Places&quot; are usually cul-de-sacs or dead-ends and run in any direction.
* In most sections of the city, the same directional is used for both of these purposes; the exceptions are immediately east and north of the downtown area, and the lack of any directionals in the downtown area itself.

Seattle is divided into ten sections, each with a different combination of directionals.

North of the Lake Washington Ship Canal are the following sections: west of 1st Avenue NW, the NW section; between 1st Avenue NW and 1st Avenue NE, the N section; east of 1st Avenue NE, the NE section.

South of the canal but north of Denny Way are the following sections: west of Queen Anne Avenue N, the W section; between Queen Anne Avenue N and a border defined by Eastlake Avenue E (south of E Nelson Place) and Lake Union (north of E Nelson Place), the Avenue N section, in which avenues are suffixed N and in which streets have no prefix; east of the Eastlake Avenue E–Lake Union border, the E section.

South of Denny Way but north of Yesler Way are two sections: east of Broadway from Yesler Way north to Union Street, east of Minor Avenue from Union Street north to Pike Street, and east of Melrose Avenue from Pike Street north to Denny Way, the E Street section, streets are prefixed E and avenues have no suffix; to the west of this border, the downtown section, no directionals are used.

South of Yesler Way are two sections: east of the waterfront and (south of the Duwamish Waterway) east of 1st Avenue S, the S section; and west of 1st Avenue S, the SW section. Within the Seattle city limits there is no SE section; however, the non-Seattle SE section contains all of the southeastern suburbs and the rest of southern King County, including Mercer Island, parts of Renton, and Bellevue south of Main Street, Sammamish south of E Main Street, and other locations within the county.
==Arterials defined==
The city defines three types of arterials — Principal, Minor, and Collector:
* Principal arterials serve as the principal route for the movement of traffic through the city. These connect interstate freeways to major activity centers, to minor and collector arterial streets and directly to destinations, as well as interneighborhood traffic.
* Minor arterials are generally located on neighborhood boundaries except when necessary to provide adequate service to traffic generators located within neighborhoods.
* Collector arterials are typically located within neighborhood boundaries and serve small group of stores, schools, small apartment complexes, and residential land uses.
* Access Streets are residential and commercial side streets.

<text>The Shi&#x27;ar ( ) are a fictional species of aliens appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Shi&#x27;ar Empire (or Imperium) is a vast collection of alien species, cultures, and worlds situated close to the Skrull and Kree Empires. The Shi&#x27;ar are one of the three main extraterrestrial empires depicted in the Marvel Universe, alongside the Kree and Skrulls.

==Publication history==
The Shi&#x27;ar first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #97 (Feb. 1976) and were created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum.

==Biology==
The Shi&#x27;ar are cold-blooded humanoids of descent; they resemble humans with feathered crests atop their heads in lieu of hair. Two different styles are common: most Shi&#x27;ar, particularly those of the aristocracy, have feathers sprouting in a triangular shape away from the face, one peak on the top of the head and one peak on each side slightly over the shoulder; the other commonly seen &quot;hairstyle&quot; is bushy on both sides and very flat on the top.

Internally, they have lightweight and hollow bones, and on their forearms there are still some vestigial feathers left of wings that were lost over millions of years of evolution. The average Shi&#x27;ar can lift 1 ton in Earth-like gravity and has far greater stamina than the average human. Most Shi&#x27;ar have no other special abilities, though occasionally a genetic throwback appears possessing wings that allow for flight (an example of atavism). The superhuman Shi&#x27;ar can at least lift one ton through exercise.The Wasp stated that the Shi&#x27;ar aren&#x27;t stronger than humans.

The Shi&#x27;ar conceive their offspring in eggs. They are nurtured in special chambers and the children are referred to as hatchlings.

The Shi&#x27;ar have more chakras than a human.

Unlike Humans the Shi&#x27;ar do not dream, except for those born &quot;defective&quot; or &quot;infected by dreams&quot;. Such Shi&#x27;ar include Warbird and the Shi&#x27;ar having survived the Fianden&#x27;s weapons.

There have also been Shi&#x27;ar who had developed superpowers such as Electron, Rook&#x27;shir, Deathcry, Dakari, White Noise and Black Light. This can be explained as most of them are members of the Imperial Family and because of Rook&#x27;shir, who had transmitted his Phoenix Force manipulation power to his descendants.

Some Shi&#x27;ar have also telepathic abilities.

==Technology==
The Shi&#x27;ar possess technologies common to most Marvel alien races, including:

* Starships capable of moving faster-than-light
* Energy-based weapons in their ships and in their handheld weapons
* force fields
* Faster-than-light communication
* Teleportation technology
* Robots
* Missiles

The Shi&#x27;ar also possess more unique technologies, including:

* Hologram technology: which is used by the X-Men in their Danger Room.
* Cloaking technology: rendering a craft completely invisible, used by the X-Men on their Blackbird aircraft.
* Stargates: Devices in a network system. They are used for travel to faraway distances including instantaneous travel between galaxies. There are planet-based Stargates (used for personal travel to other solar systems and galaxies) and enormous space-based versions (used for starships to travel through).
* Starcracker technology: This is the Shi&#x27;ar ultimate weapon. The Starcracker causes stars to go supernova.
* Warp-Capable Warships: Ranging in size from small starships to planetoid sized ships.
* Armageddon-class Killstations: Orbital battle space stations.
* Flying Walker-Spacecraft: Spaceships with walker-like legs used on land.
* Nega-Bomb: A Galactic-level weapon used to destroy Dwarf Galaxies, like the Large Magellanic Cloud. There are also lower yield Nega-Bombs used to destroy planets.
* Fusion Space Mines

According to a statement by Emma Frost in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; #9, most if not all Shi&#x27;ar technology is sentient.

==Culture==
===Language===
A Shi&#x27;ar &quot;Galaxian&quot; has stated that they have learned nearly every spoken language.

The Shi&#x27;ar have multiple forms, including the High Shi&#x27;ar, used for formal events, and Shi&#x27;ar Glorkon dialect.

Mostly for tactical terms or insults, the Shi&#x27;ar insert words of their language into English sentences.

===Philosophy===
Traditionally, the Imperium has aggressively absorbed new cultures. Warren Ellis&#x27; 1995 &quot;Starjammers&quot; miniseries described the story of the Shi&#x27;ar deities Sharra and K&#x27;ythri as a parable which guides the Shi&#x27;ar expansionist philosophy to other worlds:

Sharra and K&#x27;ythri are the gods in marriage. The gods who didn&#x27;t want to marry, but were forced into it. In marriage they found strength and in strength they found love. That&#x27;s what the Shi&#x27;ar Imperium does. It marries other cultures. Shotgun weddings.

There are aggressive and violent ancient traditions, such as the Rite of Arin&#x27;nn Haelar, which is a battle to the death. This rite can be invoked to settle disagreements and their outcomes are accepted by the Imperium. Their philosophy also impacts their court, as they do not recognize insanity.

&quot;X-Men&quot; writer Ed Brubaker compared the Shi&#x27;ar to &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s Romulans, saying they are &quot;smart, aggressive, and mean&quot;.

===Politics===
Though the empire has grown to include hundreds of thousands of different sentient species and worlds, the Shi&#x27;ar race controls and governs the empire. Its central base of power is located on the &quot;throneworld&quot; Chandilar, while the Shi&#x27;ar homeworld is called Aerie (it is unknown if the planet still exists). The leader of the empire is given the title Majestor (male) or Majestrix (female) and is a hereditary position, occupied by members of the royal family of the Shi&#x27;ar. Formerly, the Neramani family represented the royal bloodline.

The Shi&#x27;ar Empire is one of the most advanced and expansive civilizations in the universe, spanning entire galaxies. It is mainly an economic co-operative, where trade with other galactic powers is its driving force. Not all races have the same rights in the Imperium, as the Shi&#x27;ar appear to have a disproportionate influence on its governance.

It is nominally ruled over by a high council, which has representatives from a large majority of the alien races that exist within the Imperium. However, in practice, the head of the council (the Majestor or Majestrix) exercises strong executive control and can institute policy virtually by decree.

The leader of the Shi&#x27;ar empire is protected by his or her own personal guard called the Imperial Guard, which is made up of the most powerful and elite soldiers from throughout the Empire with most of them being Shi&#x27;ar and others being from other alien races in the Shi&#x27;ar&#x27;s jurisdiction. The Imperial Guard is led by a praetor. The military itself (outside of the Imperial Guard) has been depicted as consisting almost exclusively of Shi&#x27;ar personnel, at least in most of the command positions.

Though having warlike and militaristic ancestry, the Shi&#x27;ar Empire has largely occupied the role of peacekeepers in many interstellar affairs. Just to name a few, Empress Lilandra Neramani tried to broker peace between the Kree Empire and the Skrull Empire to help bring an end to their devastating war: she sought interstellar accord when deciding how to end the threat of Dark Phoenix, and attempted to avenge the destruction of Tarnax IV, the Skrull throneworld, by Galactus.

===Attitude toward the arts===
The Shi&#x27;ar consider artistic creativity to be a sign of insanity and deviance, as they lack the ability to dream. Shi&#x27;ar who have the ability to dream and create do all they can to suppress their impulses. In the past, execution was a common remedy to such &#x27;infections&#x27;. A race called the Fianden had the ability to cause any Shi&#x27;ar to dream; this caused mass catatonia and insanity in most Shi&#x27;ar, although a small subset who already are able to dream recover after a brief delay. The Fianden were wiped out in a mass genocide. After they were used to destroy the Fianden, the Shi&#x27;ar executed all of the natural dreamers to purge the taint from their bloodlines. Nevertheless, the trait does still emerge periodically, to continued violent repression.

==History==
After leaving their world, the Shi&#x27;ar started an intergalactic Empire and forced other cultures in order to become stronger and ruled for millions of years. Such cultures included the Chameloids, Lupaks, Stygians, Strontians, Hodinn, Saurids and many more. When the Shi&#x27;ar invaded the homeworld of the Mephitisoids, they declared to bring civilization to the primitive world. However this was a lie and the Mephitisoids had technology almost equal to the Shi&#x27;ar. The Shi&#x27;ar conquered the peaceful Mephistoids stealing their technology. However, the true history was lost to legend and propaganda.

When the Shi&#x27;ar known as Rook&#x27;shir was bonded to the Phoenix Force, he became Dark Phoenix and wreaked havoc across Shi&#x27;ar Empire. In order to stop him, the first Imperial Guard sent Gladiator after him, who killed him. For years all his descendants were culled, out of fear that one of them might host the Phoenix Force like their ancestor. Rook&#x27;shir left behind a sword known as the Blade of the Phoenix which contained a small portion of the Phoenix Force&#x27;s power. The sword could only be lifted by Rook&#x27;shir&#x27;s descendants. Korvus is the only known surviving descendant of Rook&#x27;shir.

===M&#x27;Kraan Crystal===

D&#x27;Ken Neramani, a corrupt Shi&#x27;ar ruler, attempted to use the powerful M&#x27;Kraan Crystal to take over the universe. His younger sister Lilandra and her new allies, the X-Men, foiled his plans. He was rendered comatose by the crystal and Lilandra then took over as the Majestrix of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. The X-Men, as well as most of Earth&#x27;s other superheroes, have had cordial if not friendly relations with the Shi&#x27;ar Empire ever since.

===Trial of Galactus===
The Shi&#x27;ar put Reed Richards on trial for the crimes of genocide. He was guilty of reviving Galactus after he was defeated on Earth. Shortly after his revival, Galactus proceeded to consume the Skrull throneworld, resulting in the death of billions. Uatu the Watcher, acting as his lawyer and with the help of Odin and Galactus himself, convinced the gathered tribunal that Galactus is a necessary force of betterment of the universe and is not a villain. This was done by summoning Eternity. The truth as shown by Eternity however, is so grand and overpowering that none of the tribunal&#x27;s members can remember it fully, although the comprehension stays.

===Deathbird, the Kree-Shi&#x27;ar War, and the Spartoi===
In the 1980s, Lilandra and D&#x27;Ken&#x27;s unstable exiled elder sibling Deathbird made several attempts to overthrow her sister from power. Deathbird even resorted to attacking Lilandra&#x27;s Earth-based allies to achieve her goals. She is also responsible for initially directing the alien parasites known as the Brood towards the Earth and its heroes. Deathbird was eventually deposed with the assistance of the X-Men.

In the 1992 crossover &quot;,&quot; the Shi&#x27;ar annexed the Kree Empire at the end of the Kree-Shi&#x27;ar War and Deathbird was placed into a prominent position as viceroy of Hala, the Kree homeworld. However, Deathbird did not last long in this position and has since abandoned her responsibilities and it appears that the Kree Empire has, at least in some part, been re-established.

The Shi&#x27;ar have had recent contact with the Spartoi.

===Phalanx===
The empire came under the threat of the &quot;techno-organic&quot; alien race known as the Phalanx after they infiltrated the Shi&#x27;ar Empire as the &quot;Pure&quot;, killing tens of thousands before the X-Men fought them on the Shi&#x27;ar throneworld and separated the transmode virus from its hosts, killing most of those Phalanx.

===Cassandra Nova===
Professor X&#x27;s evil twin sister Cassandra Nova single-handedly destroys a good portion of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. Inhabiting the body of her brother, Nova asserts control of Empress Lilandra and causes a Shi&#x27;ar civil war. Jean Grey is instrumental in ending this threat.

===Phoenix Endsong and End of Greys===

Despite the aid she gave them by eliminating the threat of Cassandra Nova, the Shi&#x27;ar still held a grudge against Jean Grey for the destruction she caused as Dark Phoenix. In the Phoenix Endsong series, a group of Shi&#x27;ar tried to eliminate both the Phoenix Force and Jean Grey. Jean, however, escaped their suicide bomb attack and returned to the White Hot Room to restore herself. In the &quot;End of Greys&quot; story arc, the Shi&#x27;ar wanted to wipe out the Grey genome and Quentin Quire with the purpose of eliminating the possibility of a new Omega-level mutant becoming a host for the Phoenix Force. The Shi&#x27;ar Death Commandos murdered Jean Grey&#x27;s father, niece, nephew, and other relatives in an alien invasion on Earth, thus inciting the wrath of Rachel Summers, the daughter of Jean Grey and Scott Summers from an alternate future, who has since declared vengeance on the entire Shi&#x27;ar Empire. Recent events seem to indicate the Shi&#x27;ar Council was responsible for this, and that Lilandra is unaware of what has been done in her name.

===Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar===

Another Shi&#x27;ar threat comes from an X-Men villain called Vulcan. During his tenure as majestor of the empire, D&#x27;Ken killed Vulcan&#x27;s mother Katherine Summers (also mother to longtime X-Men Scott and Alex Summers) and made him a slave for most of his adolescent life. Bent on revenge against D&#x27;Ken, Vulcan attacks the Empire. Not only that, but within the empire, there is a coup to dethrone Lilandra and return D&#x27;Ken to power, with the aid of Deathbird. The X-Men once again team up with their space allies, the Starjammers, to stop both Vulcan and the plot to return rulership of the empire to D&#x27;Ken. In the end, Vulcan kills his father, Corsair, and D&#x27;Ken, and assumes the throne of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire for himself, with Deathbird as his queen; Lilandra and the Starjammers now lead a resistance against Vulcan&#x27;s rule. This occurs in a 12 issue arc entitled &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire&quot;.

===Emperor Vulcan===

The civil war between Vulcan&#x27;s forces and those loyal to the dethroned Lilandra rages on. Led by Havok and the Starjammers, Lilandra&#x27;s forces gradually whittle away at Vulcan&#x27;s forces, which are plagued by defections. The Shi&#x27;ar, contrary to Vulcan&#x27;s expectations, are not happy to have an outsider as their ruler. Vulcan is discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinces him that they will come to accept him.

Warned in advance of a rebel raid on Feather&#x27;s Edge, Vulcan and his fleet ambush the Starjammers. However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the Hammer, is destroyed by the Scy&#x27;ar Tal (translates as &quot;Death to the Shi&#x27;ar&quot;). Vulcan and Gladiator (still the praetor of his Imperial Guard) attack the leader of the Scy&#x27;ar Tal and are easily defeated, whereupon they retreat deeper into Shi&#x27;ar space.

Marvel Girl makes contact with the Eldest Scy&#x27;ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy&#x27;ar Tal were originally called the M&#x27;Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi&#x27;ar attacked them, killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi&#x27;ar settled on their planet, took the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra &amp; K&#x27;ythri. The M&#x27;Kraan then changed their name to Scy&#x27;ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather&#x27;s Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan makes contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.

Under the ceasefire, the Shi&#x27;ar and the Starjammers decide to take out the Finality, thus crippling the Scy&#x27;ar&#x27;s biggest threat. Once Havok and Vulcan are in position to destroy Finality, the Eldest Scy&#x27;ar tries to stop them. Once Vulcan figures out how the Eldest is powered, he severs the connection Eldest has with his brothers, making him powerless. Once the connection is severed, the Scy&#x27;ar become disorganized, and the tide of the battle shifts to the Sh&#x27;ar. The Shi&#x27;ar then proceed to attack both the Scy&#x27;ar and the Starjammers. Meanwhile, Vulcan blasts Havok into a sun.

Vulcan decides to use Finality to destroy the Scy&#x27;ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet. Alex returns and, having absorbed enough power to burn him, decides to end things with Vulcan. While they battle, Rachel and Korvus try, but fail to stop the beacon that will initiate the attack by the Shi&#x27;ar. The Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard end Alex&#x27;s battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity, threatening to kill them. Before surrendering, Alex destroys Finality. With Alex and the Starjammers in custody Vulcan declares that he will return the Shi&#x27;ar Empire to its former glory.

===X-Men: Kingbreaker===

Vulcan and the Shi&#x27;ar were featured prominently in the mini-series X-Men: Kingbreaker that revolved around Vulcan and the Starjammers following the conclusion of the mini-series Emperor Vulcan. This mini-series led to the War of Kings event and revealed that eons ago the Shi&#x27;ar, used dark sorcery to created and stored in Null Space the Tree of Shadows which is the repository for all of the Darkhawk amulets used to empower the Fraternity of Raptors to whom the Shi&#x27;ar intended to use to maintain the Shi&#x27;ar Empire as it evolved over the centuries. The Fraternity of Raptors refer to their mission to protect the long term interests of the empire as &quot;The Great Purpose.&quot; However, as the Shi&#x27;ar Empire aggressively expanded so to did the Fraternity of Raptors and eventually they grew too powerful for the Empire to control. Therefore, they all were sealed in patches of dark matter throughout Shi&#x27;ar territory and their history almost completely forgotten.

===War of Kings===

The story revolved around the Starjammers, the Shi&#x27;ar, the Inhumans, the Kree, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Nova Corps.

The Shi&#x27;ar end up in conflict with the Inhumans and the Kree. After the death of Lilandra and the presumed deaths of Vulcan and Black Bolt, Gladiator assumes the throne and surrenders to the Inhumans and the Kree when the damage to the Shi&#x27;ar military is too much.

===Infinity===
During the &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, it is revealed that at some point, the Shi&#x27;ar managed to take control of their own empire back from the Kree as Gladiator appears as a member of the Galactic Council representing the Shi&#x27;ar Empire.

===Time Runs Out===
When the Shi&#x27;ar found out that the reason for the decay of the universe was on Earth, they decided to destroy the planet. However, the Guardians of the Galaxy managed to warn the Avengers about the attack.

When approaching Earth, the Shi&#x27;ar alerted humanity about their destruction of Earth. However Sunspot and A.I.M. used a super weapon to retaliate against the Shi&#x27;ar, while S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s Avengers used a Planetkiller to attack from behind. However, A.I.M.&#x27;s weapon exploded due to overheat, and the Planetkiller was destroyed by the Annihilation Wave. The Avengers were ready to meet their end, but the Illuminati intervened used the controller disk of a rogue planet that shared the same space with Earth, while Iron Man flew to the Sol&#x27;s Hammer, and used it, successfully destroying the Shi&#x27;ar fleet, including the Imperial Guards.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel,&quot; it was revealed that some Shi&#x27;ar that are living on Earth have established a Shi&#x27;ar corporation called Shi&#x27;ar Solutions Consolidations.

====Asgard/Shi&#x27;ar War====
During &quot;The Asgard/Shi&#x27;ar War&quot; storyline, the Shi&#x27;ar Gods Sharra and K&#x27;ythri do a &quot;Challenge of the Gods&quot; by bringing the Shi&#x27;ar fleet to Asgard whilst threatening Earth with their Super Destroyers. An event which had been secretly instigated by Loki behind closed doors. In the Natural Disasters Round, Sharra and K&#x27;ythri use their power to cause a tidal wave in order to ferment greater worship in the survivors. Thor impedes their efforts by saving lives instead of claiming them, the round going to her as the living Shi&#x27;ar people are thankful for her mercy; much to her displeasure. Round after round where countless denizens of the Shi&#x27;ar are slaughtered in these inane divinity games weights heavily on Thor/Jane&#x27;s conscience. Until finally after the Genesis Round, where the Shi&#x27;ar gods use dust to create Shi&#x27;ar Giants who indiscriminately murder more of their worshipers causes the female Thor to fight them. As the female Thor failed to create life, the Shi&#x27;ar won the Genesis Round. Having had enough of the murderous spectacles, Thor chose to directly challenge the Shi&#x27;ar gods; later receiving some unexpected help from the Asgardian Gods themselves. It was this act that tilted the Challenge of the Gods in her favor as none had ever brought so many divine under their banner to fight at their side before, causing the new Thor to be crowned winner of the Challenge. Greatly angered at such a turn of events Sharra and K&#x27;ythri order their Majestor to eviscerate her homeworld in retribution; but the Emperor of the Shi&#x27;ar rebel&#x27;s against their gods after their wanton display. In their final fit of mindless ire, the Shi&#x27;ar gods summoned the Phoenix Force to eviscerate the galaxy spiting everyone who defied them. Later after a sorrowing battle following the appeasement of the Phoenix, the former gods of the empire are taken away to the dungeons of &quot;Omnipotence City&quot; for their crimes and reckless actions. All while Kid Omega, holder of a Phoenix Force shard, acts as a stand in for the divinity of the Shi&#x27;ar empire.

====Infinity Countdown====
During the search of the Infinity Stones, Razor reveals the true origin of the Tree of Shadows and the creation of the Fraternity of Raptors, according to Razor the Tree of Shadows was created eons ago by the Elder of the Universe known as The Gardener who tried to bring life to the Null Space and planted it in the Darkforce Dimension. Eventually, Null Space and the Tree of Shadows were discovered by a more pre-historic version of the Shi&#x27;ar and the Skrulls, a find that ended in war erupting between the two alien races. The war ranged until one member of the Shi&#x27;ar was able to grasp one of the seeds of the Tree. His physiology, fear and belief&#x27;s shaped the birth of the most vicious killing machine the universe had ever seen, the first Raptor and while the Skrulls, being shape-shifters, were still able to hold out against the Shi&#x27;ar, they eventually were nevertheless slaughtered by Raptor Prime, a creature of instinct and adaptation which quickly learnt to use their enemies shape-shifting abilities as well. It can be assumed that due to the incident with Rook&#x27;shir, the Shi&#x27;ar then intended to use the seeds of the Tree of Shadows to create an army to unleash Ratha&#x27;kon or the Dark Starhawk, a being who would be able to contain and act as a &quot;predator&quot; to the Phoenix Force, however, while the Fraternity of Raptors attempted to mimic the Cosmic entity, because of their mechanoid nature, they were unable to unlock much less ascertain the coveted true power of which within their ranks. Which was why Gyre, a corrupted anathema of the Fraternity utilized the once Nova turned Raptor Robbie Rider; brother of Richard Rider and traitor to the Nova Corp and Earth. Sought to utilize the amulet of Christopher Powell as the conduit in which Talon-R would become host to the Dark Starhawk with intent to raze the planet Earth, but was destroyed by the possessed entity due to his reviled nature as a result.

====Mr. &amp; Mrs. X====
Though largely prosperous for a time the Shi&#x27;ar still suffer from the occasional strife brought upon by the treacherous Deathbird. She and her rebel faction stand against the empire on the grounds that Kallark, head of the Imperial Guard and current Majestor of the Shi&#x27;ar, isn&#x27;t a true Shi&#x27;ar and thus believe his rule to be illegitimate. To actualize their claim, the insurgents are in hot pursuit of an item pertaining critical importance to the Shi&#x27;ar Imperium, a glowing egg contain the next successor to monarchy and the throne. In truth the shell was only a telepathic mirage thrown up by its true contents, the prize in actuality being the genetically engineered daughter of Professor and Lilandra Neramani whom after having telepathically scanned the minds of X-Men newlyweds Rogue and Gambit, took the name of Xandra when modeling herself after her deceased parents. Kitty Pryde goes on to say that the reason she&#x27;s such a sought after commodity across the spaceways is because she was sworn into the Shi&#x27;ar royal line by her mother on top of having inherited her father&#x27;s vast psionic talents making her both an Omega Level Weapon not to mention a highly coveted political bargaining chip to the Shi&#x27;ar themselves.

====First Blood Spilled====
Since then Xandra has assumed the throne of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire and has been successfully running the vast galactic society, at least until the recent reveal that the Shi&#x27;ar Empire has hidden a secret about the first &quot;ancient mutants&quot; from everyone, even Majestrix Xandra herself. The Marauders and Xandra come into conflict with the Shi&#x27;ar&#x27;s sect of secret-keepers the Crimson Kin, who eventually assassinate her to stop her from &quot;betraying&quot; their darkest secrets to Krakoa.

Eventually, Kate Pryde and her band of Marauders discover the greatest secret of the Shi&#x27;ar - an encounter with the inhabitants of Earth that occurred billions of years ago. The ancient Shi&#x27;ar, still possessing their avian traits, were a race of raiders allied with the Lupak, and on Earth they discovered a civilization capable of repelling them, a mutant society named Threshold. Incredibly, this mutant community existed billions of years before humans evolved. With their pride wounded, the Shi&#x27;ar prepared for a war, and tried to wipe out these ancient mutants only to lose again. Their defeat was so overwhelming that they hid it from the annals of history. But the truth remained as they used the Xorrian science to alter their evolution into the Shi&#x27;ar of the present day and when these early mutants were forced to flee Earth to avoid a cataclysmic events, the Shi&#x27;ar took the opportunity to wipe out most of the briefly vulnerable mutants as they attempted in other realities. Only a handful of mutants survived, placed outside of time by the Shi&#x27;ar, but even then they were seemingly executed by the Shi&#x27;ar years previously, cutting off Krakoa from that piece of their history.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel universe, the Shi&#x27;ar are not an alien race, but a religious group whose beliefs are said to have descended from alien knowledge. They worship the Phoenix, believing it to be a god of not only destruction, but renewal. Their beliefs state that all of the Earth was originally a prison created by ancient alien civilizations to hold the Phoenix, but its presence at the core led to the creation of life on Earth, and the Phoenix&#x27;s direct influence resulted in all major steps of evolution for man, and specifically, led to the creation of mutants. The Ultimate version of the Hellfire Club is an offshoot of the Shi&#x27;ar religion that believes the Phoenix only desires destruction.

Recently an alternate version of the Lilandra character has turned up in the Ultimate Marvel universe&#x27;s Ultimate X-Men title. Ultimate Lilandra is not an alien, but the Majestrix of the Church of Shi&#x27;ar Enlightenment, and contacts Professor Xavier with the offer of funding his school&#x27;s immense budget, in exchange for the chance to see if Jean Grey is the human host for The Phoenix.

<text>Paul Henry Calvert, AO (born 19 January 1940) is a former Australian politician who served as a Senator for Tasmania from 1987 to 2007, representing the Liberal Party. He was President of the Senate from 2002 to 2007.

==Early life==
Born into a long established farming family based outside Hobart, Calvert still runs a property in Tasmania. He was active in local government, serving as Warden (the title later changed to Mayor) of the City of Clarence, on Hobart&#x27;s eastern shore. He was also President of the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania.

==Politics==
In 1987 he was elected to the Australian Senate, after declining an invitation by the former Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Robin Gray, to run for the House of Assembly after a successful career in local government and agri-politics. He was re-elected in 1990, 1996 and 2001.

In 1997 Calvert became the government&#x27;s Senate Whip. He became president following Margaret Reid in 2002, and was re-elected in 2005. Early in his presidency he tackled the archaic five department structure of the Australian Parliament, and achieved a streamlining to 3 departments – one for each Chamber and one looking after joint services.

On 7 August 2007 Calvert announced his intention to resign his position as President of the Senate on 14 August and to resign as a Senator for Tasmania before the Senate resumed on 10 September. He was succeeded as Senate President by South Australian Liberal Senator Alan Ferguson. He formally resigned as a Senator on 29 August 2007.

==Later life and honours==
In 2008 he was appointed a member of the Governing Council of Old Parliament House in Canberra. As part of the 2009 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia.

<text>The Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (the B.P.R.D. or BPRD) is a fictional organization in the comic book work of Mike Mignola. The B.P.R.D. originally appeared in the &quot;Hellboy&quot; comics and has since become a major part of its expanded universe, where it was supposedly founded by the United States and United Kingdom governments, and charged with researching the occult, paranormal and supernatural, and also defending against their dangers. 

In 2002, Dark Horse Comics launched the &quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; comic series, and in 2014 the &quot;Hellboy and the B.P.R.D.&quot; series.

==Fictional organization history==
In the &quot;Hellboy&quot; comics, the B.P.R.D. was founded in 1945 by Professor Trevor Bruttenholm to combat various occult threats uncovered in operations against Nazi Germany. It initially had strong links to the United States Army Air Forces and was based at a military airbase in New Mexico, but in 1947 later relocated to a custom built facility in Fairfield, Connecticut. It maintains strong links to various branches of the US military to this day. It is a private organization that receives funding from several major governments (mostly the United States and United Kingdom, although other countries including Canada, Japan, France, and Italy have been mentioned).

Professor Bruttenholm served as director until the late 1950s when he stepped down to return to field work. The current director is Dr. Thomas Manning. Over the years, the Bureau has added several agents with &quot;enhanced skills&quot; to its ranks including Hellboy in 1952, Liz Sherman in 1980, and Abe Sapien in 1981.

The B.P.R.D. is a well known and respected organization that has excellent relations with most international governments and United States government agencies, with the exceptions of China and the CIA.

===The &quot;Plague of Frogs&quot; Cycle===
The Bureau was the United States&#x27; only defense against an onslaught of frog creatures (originally featured in &quot;Seed of Destruction&quot;). Though the &quot;frogs&quot; began operating on the East Coast, they spread west on both sides of the US-Canada border. To cut costs, the Bureau moved from its traditional headquarters in Connecticut to an abandoned research facility in Colorado. This facility was last used to house Nazi scientists who defected to America after World War II. As such, the facility contains vast quantities of secret files that the B.P.R.D. has yet to explore.

The frog monster invasion reached its peak during the events of &quot;The Black Flame&quot; during which a Neo-Nazi madman adopted the persona of the World War II era supervillain the Black Flame and insinuated himself as the leader of the frogs. Together they raised the gigantic Katha-Hem (one of the Ogdru Hem, the 369 spawn of the Ogdru Jahad) which ran rampant across the American heartland until Liz Sherman used an ancient artifact to amplify her pyrokinetic powers a thousandfold. After Katha-Hem was destroyed, the frog monsters dragged the Black Flame into a vast pit and the invasion appeared to come to an end.

A series of incidents—featured in &quot;The Warning&quot;, &quot;The Black Goddess&quot;, and &quot;King of Fear&quot;—saw the Bureau threatened by both an alliance of the frogs, the Black Flame, and creatures from the Hollow Earth, united to bring about an apocalypse and the birth of a new human race; and also the villain Memnan Saa, who abducted Liz in an attempt to use her powers to conquer the Earth so he could prevent the Apocalypse. This crisis saw half of Munich destroyed, the Bureau discredited in the eyes of the American military, and Abe Sapien revealed to be an example of the next stage of the frog&#x27;s evolution. Finally, Liz Sherman exhausted all of her powers in destroying the underworld alliance. This inadvertently caused massive volcanic disasters across the world, devastating Malaysia and causing the destruction of Borneo (wiping out the nations of Indonesia and Brunei), and also causing the rise of a large, immobile monster in California, spewing out a gas across America and Mexico that mutates people. In the wake of this new crisis, the United Nations Security Council drafted the Bureau to work directly for them, with &quot;blank cheque&quot; funding.

A vision of the future shown in &quot;King of Fear&quot; showed the apocalypse had triumphed over this larger, more heavily armed B.P.R.D.

===The &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; Cycle===

In the wake of the events of &quot;King of Fear&quot;, the world enters an apocalyptic era as natural disasters and vicious monsters crawl out of the Earth. Society is pushed to the brink of madness as many new cults arise to worship the creatures, while other supernatural forces begin shifting their plans in response to the global chaos. The B.P.R.D. agents face their own struggles during this time - Johann claims revenge on Ben Daimio for the destruction of his new body, while Abe is shot in the head by a panicked psychic girl named Fenix. Fortunately for the B.P.R.D., they gain new allies as well in the form of the Russian Special Sciences Service (S.S.S.), with their director Iosif Nichayko.

Unfortunately, Zinco and the last remnants of Project Ragnarok inadvertently resurrect a new and more powerful Black Flame, who proceeds to take control of New York and reawaken many slumbering Ogdru Hem all over the globe. Abe recovers from his near-fatal wound in time to see the world in an even worse state than last he saw, and he goes AWOL from the B.P.R.D. to go on a journey of self-discovery. Liz regains her powers and rejoins the B.P.R.D., while Johann transfers his spirit into the WWII Sledgehammer suit and together they fight the Ogdru Hem as they run rampant. Eventually they take on the new Black Flame in New York, but their victory only proves hollow as one of the seven Ogdru Jahad lands in Kansas, spawning an army of Ogdru Hem as it tears its way across the land. Johann ends up sacrificing himself to defeat the dragon, paralyzing all the Ogdru Hem around the world and giving the world a moment of peaceful respite.

==Publication history==

The Bureau made its first appearance in the pages of the &quot;Hellboy&quot; miniseries &quot;&quot; (4 issues, March–June 1994) and was a major part of the comic until Hellboy leaves the B.P.R.D. at the end of &quot;&quot;. At this point the &quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; series began, following the agents of the B.P.R.D. such as Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Roger and Johann Krauss.

&quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; was once considered a &quot;series of miniseries&quot;, with each story reading as a stand-alone story easily enough, but over time, an overarching story began to develop. When a new story cycle began, the series was retitled &quot;B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth,&quot; then two years later when the series hit its 100th issue, it was restructured as an ongoing monthly comic. This was done for many reasons, most notably to make the reading order simpler to the uninitiated.

===Stories===
&quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; began as a series of miniseries, but it also had an ongoing numbering on the inside cover of its issues. For the 100th issue the internal numbering shifted to the front cover as the series became a monthly ongoing comic.

===Collected editions===

====&quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; trade paperbacks====
Most of the &quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; comics have been collected by Dark Horse as trade paperbacks:

====&quot;B.P.R.D. Vampire&quot; trade paperbacks====
In all ways this appears to be another regular &quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; trade save for the details on the spine that indicate it is the first in a new line. Only one has been published so far, but there are plans for more in the future.

====&quot;B.P.R.D. Hell on Earth&quot; trade paperbacks====
There is also a series of trade paperbacks collecting the &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; cycle:

====&quot;B.P.R.D. The Devil You Know&quot; trade paperbacks====

There is also a series of trade paperbacks collecting &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; cycle:

====Omnibus editions====
Dark Horse have also released a series of omnibus editions:

==In other media==

===Films===
The Bureau appeared in the 2004 film &quot;Hellboy&quot; and its 2008 sequel &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;, both directed by Guillermo del Toro, where it differs from the agency in the comics. 
*In the film it is a secret United States Government agency, created by Roosevelt to combat Hitler&#x27;s growing mastery of the occult, and strongly affiliated with the FBI. Professor Bruttenholm claims that the BPRD fought the Occult Wars that ended in 1958 with the death of Adolf Hitler.
*Several personnel are federal agents, including Manning and new character Special Agent John Myers whilst the director is still Professor Bruttenholm, who refers to the bureau as &quot;the ones who bump back&quot;, in reference to &quot;things that go bump in the night&quot;.
*The BPRD uses the motto &quot;In Absentia Luci, Tenebrae Vincunt&quot;, Latin for &quot;In the Absence of Light, Darkness Prevails&quot;—though this motto is grammatically incorrect—Luci should read &quot;Lucis&quot; for the desired meaning.
*In &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;, the Bureau&#x27;s existence is confirmed when Hellboy reveals himself to the media after battling vicious tooth-fairies. The film reveals there is a German branch where Johann was stationed until he became the new director of the US branch.
* In the &quot;2019 reboot&quot;, the Bureau is a public multinational agency.
*It is hinted that the base may be related to military base Area 51 as the number 51 appears on the walls.

===Television===
&quot;The B.P.R.D. Declassified&quot; was a TV special that aired on the FX in 2004.

===Roleplaying game===
The B.P.R.D. appeared in the &quot;Hellboy Sourcebook and Role Playing Game&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* In the film &quot;Blade II&quot;, Blade&#x27;s young assistant, Scud, wears a shirt bearing the B.P.R.D. logo. Guillermo del Toro, who directed &quot;Blade II&quot;, is a fan of Hellboy, and later he directed the film adaptation and its sequel.
* In the comic shop in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, the B.P.R.D. comic is prominently and repeatedly featured.
* In the show &quot;Hawaii 5-0&quot; a &quot;B.P.R.D. Hell on Earth: New World&quot; poster is on the wall of Dr. Max Bergman&#x27;s (played by Masi Oka) apartment.

<doc id="581443" wikidata="Q1372092" url="?curid=581443" title="James Henry Craig">
<text>General Sir James Henry Craig KB (1748 – 12 January 1812) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator who served as the Governor General of British North America from 1807 to 1811. 

==Early life and military service==
Craig came from a Scottish family whose father was a judge of the civil and military courts in the British fortress of Gibraltar. At the age of 15 in 1763 he was enrolled as an ensign in the 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot. Colonel Robert Boyd, the lieutenant governor of Gibraltar in 1770 endorsed his promotion to an aide-de-camp which allowed him to later take command of a company in the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot stationed in the American colonies.

==Service during the American War of Independence==
After the outbreak of the War of Independence in 1775, Craig took part in the Battle of Bunker Hill, where he was badly wounded, but refused to leave his regiment, and participated in the defence of Quebec in 1776, where he met the American invaders at Trois-Rivières while commanding the advance guard that forced them back beyond the border. 

During 1777, he was wounded twice, once seriously, during engagements at Fort Ticonderoga, Hubbardton, and Freeman&#x27;s Farm. Major-General John Burgoyne, who expressed high regard for Craig as an officer, recommended him for the rank of a major in the 82nd Regiment of Foot (1777) in recognition of his service. 

From 1778 to 1781 Craig served with the 82nd Regiment in Nova Scotia, at Penobscot, and later in North Carolina. Due to constant involvement in operations during the war, Craig usually led light infantry troops.

==Service during the Napoleonic Wars==
After promotion to lieutenant-colonel in 1781, Craig became Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey in 1793 and then an adjutant general to the Duke of York in the 1794 Army of Netherlands, being promoted to major-general.

In 1794–1795, the Netherlands were overrun by the revolutionary armies of the new republic of France, and Stadtholder Prince William V of Orange became a refugee in England. A British force under General Sir James Craig set out to Cape Town to secure the colony against the French. The Battle of Muizenberg successfully wrested control from William V of Orange to Britain.

In 1795 he served with Vice-Admiral Viscount Keith and Major-General Alured Clarke in occupying the Cape Colony from the Dutch Republic where he became governor of the new possession, and remained in that posting until 1797, for which he received the Order of the Bath. In the same year Craig sailed to Madras, and saw combat in the Bengal region of India for which he was again promoted to lieutenant-general in January 1801. Craig returned to England to serve for three years as the commander of the Eastern District.

In 1805, despite poor health, he was appointed to lead the Anglo-Russian invasion of Naples, but after a brief occupation, the mission was aborted after the news of Austrian defeat at the Battle of Ulm.

==Service in Canada==

Craig concurrently held the positions of Governor-General of British North America and lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada from 1807 to 1811. Craig considered measures such as creating English counties and replacing the legislative assembly with an appointed government as a means of increasing the power of English speakers in predominantly French Lower Canada. He tried to encourage immigration from Britain and the United States in hopes of making the French a minority.

In 1809, he employed a former U.S. Army officer named John Henry to determine if the Federalist New England states desired seceding from the United States and returning to their former states as Crown colonies. The British did not pursue re-acquiring New England and, after Henry unsuccessfully sought to be rewarded for his efforts, Henry sold the correspondence to President James Madison for $50,000 and sailed for France. (See Henry letters.)

<doc id="581444" wikidata="Q5981237" url="?curid=581444" title="Robert McClelland (Australian politician)">
<text>Robert Bruce McClelland (born 26 January 1958) is an Australian judge and former politician who has served on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia since 2015, including as Deputy Chief Justice of that court since 2018. He was previously Attorney-General of Australia from 2007 to 2011, and a member of the House of Representatives from 1996 to 2013, representing the Labor Party.

==Early life and education==
McClelland is the son of Doug McClelland, a former Senator for New South Wales between 1962 and 1987, and a minister in the Whitlam government and President of the Senate, serving between 1983 and 1987. His grandfather was Alfred McClelland, a state Labor MP from 1920 to 1932.

McClelland was educated at Blakehurst High School before studying at the University of New South Wales, where he gained bachelor&#x27;s degrees in arts and law, and the University of Sydney where he gained a master&#x27;s degree in law.

==Career==
Prior to entering politics, McClelland was an Associate to Justice Phillip Evatt of the Federal Court of Australia 1981–82 before becoming a solicitor and ultimately partner with law firm Turner Freeman.

===Political career===
Two years after his election to parliament, McClelland became a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry. He was Shadow Attorney-General 1998–2003, Shadow Minister for Workplace Relations 2001–03, Shadow Minister for Homeland Security 2003–05, Shadow Minister for Defence 2004–06 and Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs 2006–07.

After McClelland indicated on 8 October 2007 his party&#x27;s disapproval of death sentences for all south Asian countries, his leader Kevin Rudd criticised the speech as &quot;insensitive&quot; because it was made on the eve of the anniversary of the Bali bombings. McClelland apologised, but critics called the positions inconsistent and Rudd chose not to appoint McClelland as Foreign Minister when Labor won the 2007 election. Instead, he was appointed Attorney-General. As Attorney-General McClelland introduced the &quot;Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Act&quot; 2010.

In the 2007 federal election, McClelland was re-elected to the seat of Barton with a 4.53% swing toward the Labor Party.

In February 2008, McClelland stated that it was unacceptable that the ACT government, which proposed to allow same-sex couples to enter into civil unions, would give the right to hold public ceremonies to celebrate their unions. McClelland was criticised by Greens Senator Bob Brown, who said it was displaying the ugly face of Labor conservatism.
In September 2008 McClelland introduced the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—General Law Reform) Bill 2008 which gave same sex couples equal rights in respect to social security, taxation and superannuation laws.

McClelland has said those protesting against Australian Christian Lobby would not have recognised that the ACL had supported amendments to 84 pieces of Commonwealth legislation that removed discrimination against same-sex couples.

McClelland remarked that on Polygamy in Australia &quot;There is absolutely no way that the government will be recognising polygamist relationships. They are unlawful and they will remain as such. Under Australian law, marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others. Polygamous marriage necessarily offends this definition.&quot;

McClelland was responsible for implementing the recommendations of the Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission including the implementation of a National Emergency Warning System.

As Attorney-General, McClelland undertook an extensive review of the International Arbitration Act. That review formed the basis of amendments to the Act that were introduced in 2010. The Amendments gave arbitral tribunals a wider degree of flexibility in controlling arbitral proceedings and included inserting an object to emphasise the importance of international arbitration in facilitating international trade and commerce. Provisions were also introduced to require Courts applying the Act and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration Law to have regard to the fact that arbitration is an ‘efficient, impartial, enforceable and timely’ method of dispute resolution.

McClelland also introduced amendments to federal family law, including by giving the federal family law courts jurisdiction over the financial affairs of de facto spouses.

In the 2010 federal election, McClelland was re-elected to the seat of Barton, but suffered an 8.08% swing against the Labor Party.

As part of a cabinet reshuffle in December 2011 he was moved to oversee the portfolio of emergency management and housing. In a further cabinet reshuffle in February 2012 following Kevin Rudd&#x27;s leadership challenge, McClelland returned to the backbench.

On 29 January 2013, McClelland announced that he would not contest the 2013 federal election.

===Judicial career===

On 28 May 2015, McClelland was appointed to the Family Court of Australia by Attorney-General George Brandis. He is based in the Court&#x27;s Sydney registry and his appointment commenced on 16 June 2015. He was appointed Deputy Chief Justice of that court with effect from 10 December 2018.

==Honours==
In 2022, McClelland was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2022 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;distinguished service to the people and Parliament of Australia, to the law, social justice and law reform&quot;.

<doc id="581446" wikidata="Q6375611" url="?curid=581446" title="Kate Lundy">
<text>Kate Alexandra Lundy (born 15 December 1967) is an Australian former politician. She was a Labor Party member of the Australian Senate, representing the Australian Capital Territory. Lundy served as the Minister for Multicultural Affairs and the Minister Assisting for the Digital Economy in the Second Rudd Ministry; having previously served as the Minister for Sport and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Innovation.

==Background and early career==
Born in Sydney, Lundy left school without completing Year 11 and did not tell her parents. She went to work on a construction site. She became the trade union representative and began her career in the Building Workers&#x27; Industrial Union.

==Political career==

In 1996, aged 28, Lundy became the youngest woman from the Australian Labor Party to be elected to the federal parliament; since superseded by Kate Ellis. She replaced Bob McMullan in the Senate when he moved to a lower house seat in that year&#x27;s election.

After the 1998 Australian federal election, Lundy was made Shadow Minister for Sport and Youth Affairs and Shadow Minister Assisting the Shadow Minister for Industry and Technology on Information Technology. In 2001, she became Shadow Minister for Information Technology and Sport. She added the Arts and Recreation to her responsibilities in 2003 after Mark Latham became federal Labor leader. She was Shadow Minister for Manufacturing and Consumer Affairs from October 2004 to June 2005, when she was appointed Shadow Minister for Sport and Recreation. With the election of Kevin Rudd as Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party in December 2006, the responsibilities of Health Promotion and Local Government were added to Lundy&#x27;s responsibilities for Sport and Recreation.

Following the 2007 federal election, Lundy was replaced by Kate Ellis, who was appointed as Minister for Sport and Minister for Youth.

On 11 September 2010, Lundy was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Citizenship as well as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Cabinet as part of the original Second Gillard Ministry. In a subsequent reshuffle in March 2012, Lundy was appointed as the Minister for Sport following the retirement of Senator Mark Arbib, and she was also made Minister for Multicultural Affairs, and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Innovation. On 1 July 2013, as part of the Second Rudd Ministry, Lundy retained the portfolio of Multicultural Affairs and gained the portfolio of Minister Assisting for the Digital Economy. Don Farrell was appointed as Minister for Sport.

Lundy is a member of the Socialist Left faction of Labor. She has been highly active on the issue of internet regulation, arguing against both the Howard government&#x27;s and her own party&#x27;s policy in that area. Lundy is also patron of the Canberra Rowing Club and the Pearcey Foundation.

On 26 November 2014, Lundy announced that she would not stand for re-election at the 2016 federal election. She resigned from the Senate on 24 March 2015, and the next day former ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher was appointed as her replacement by the ACT Legislative Assembly.

==Awards==
In 2010, Lundy won the International Top 10 People Changing the World of Internet and Politics at the 11th World eDemocracy Forum which was held in Paris, France.

<text>The Rhode Island School of Design (RISD , pronounced &quot;Riz-D&quot;) is a private art and design school in Providence, Rhode Island. The school was founded as a coeducational institution in 1877 by Helen Adelia Rowe Metcalf, who sought to increase the accessibility of design education to women. Today, RISD offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree programs across 19 majors and enrolls approximately 2,000 undergraduate and 500 graduate students. The Rhode Island School of Design Museum—which houses the school&#x27;s art and design collections—is one of the largest college art museums in the United States.

The Rhode Island School of Design is affiliated with Brown University, whose campus sits immediately adjacent to RISD&#x27;s on Providence&#x27;s College Hill. The two institutions share social and community resources and since 1900 have permitted cross-registration. Together, RISD and Brown offer dual degree programs at the graduate and undergraduate levels. As of 2024, RISD alumni have received 11 MacArthur Fellowships, 9 Emmy Awards, 7 Guggenheim Fellowships, and 3 Academy Awards.

== History ==
=== Founding of the school ===
The Rhode Island School of Design&#x27;s founding is often traced back to Helen Adelia Rowe Metcalf&#x27;s 1876 visit to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. At the exposition, Metcalf visited the Women&#x27;s Pavilion. Organized by the &quot;Centennial Women,&quot; the pavilion showcased the work of female entrepreneurs, artists, and designers. Metcalf&#x27;s visit to the pavilion profoundly impacted her and motivated her to address a deficiency in design education accessible to women.

Following the exhibition, the RI committee of the Centennial Women had $1,675 remaining in funds; the group spent some time negotiating how best to use the surplus. Metcalf lobbied the group to use the money to establish a coeducational, design school in Providence. On January 11, 1877, a majority of women on the committee voted for Metcalf&#x27;s proposal.

On March 22, 1877, the Rhode Island General Assembly ratified &quot;An Act to Incorporate the Rhode Island School of Design&quot;, &quot;[f]or the purpose of aiding in the cultivation of the arts of design&quot;. Over the next 129 years, the following original by-laws set forth these following primary objectives:

#The instruction of artisans in drawing, painting, modeling, and designing, that they may successfully apply the principles of Art to the requirements of trade and manufacture.
#The systematic training of students in the practice of Art, in order that they may understand its principles, give instruction to others, or become artists.
#The general advancement of public Art Education, by the exhibition of works of Art and of Art school studies, and by lectures on Art.

Metcalf directed the school until her death in 1895. Her daughter, Eliza Greene Metcalf Radeke, then took over until her own death in 1931.

=== Beginnings ===
The school opened in October 1877 in Providence. The first class consisted of 43 students, the majority of whom were women.

For the first 15 years of its existence, RISD occupied a suite of six rooms on the fourth floor of the Hoppin Homestead Building in Downtown Providence. On October 24, 1893, the school dedicated a new brick building at 11 Waterman Street on College Hill. Designed by Hoppin, Read &amp; Hoppin, this building served as the first permanent home for the school.

===Activism during the Vietnam War===
Students at RISD played a key part in the national protest of the Vietnam War, producing various notable anti-war protest art from 1968–1973 and taking several on tour as part of a mobile artwork petition. The most well known is &quot;Leave the Fear of Red to Horned Beasts&quot;, a reference to Victor Hugo novel Les Misérables in the form of a watercolor-on-canvas painting of a charging red bull. An original print of this painting is on permanent display at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in a section dedicated to international protest of the Vietnam War, and also features subtly as a bar mural in the Vietnam War film &quot;Point Man&quot;.

In 1969 the Black Student Community of RISD published a manifesto demanding of university faculty the establishment of &quot;a meaningful liaison with the spirit and expression of Black culture.&quot; RISD subsequently hired administrators to begin recruiting and admitting increased numbers of students of color.

=== COVID-19 ===
After the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent closure of the RISD campus in March 2020, RISD suggested a future of a hybrid of classes online and in-person.

In July 2020, President Somerson began negotiations with the RISD faculty union over the avoidance of possible layoffs by suggesting cost-cutting measures. The part-time faculty union, the National Education Association, rejected the initial proposal.

=== Racial diversity and equity ===
In the summer of 2020, after the Black Lives Matter and George Floyd protests, RISD students and alumni came forward to voice outrage at the institution for failing at social equity and inclusion. They formed a student-led RISD Anti-Racism Coalition (ARC) alongside BIPOC faculty. As a result, in July 2020, RISD announced they would hire 10 new faculty members that would specialize in &quot;race and ethnicity in arts and design&quot;, the RISD museum would return to Nigeria a sculpture that was once looted, expand and diversify the curriculum, and the school would, &quot;remain committed to reform&quot;.

===Labor strike===
In April 2023, after months of negotiations, the RISD employees union held a picket line protest in demand of better wages. The union, which represents custodians, groundskeepers and movers, was joined in the strike by student supporters and community members. The strike lasted two weeks, until workers approved a new contract and returned to work April 19.

=== Pro-Palestine solidarity ===

Students at RISD, along with many across the country in the BDS movement, occupied a campus building for multiple days in support of a cease-fire of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in early May 2024.

=== Presidents ===

RISD&#x27;s current president is Crystal Williams. She was preceded by Rosanne Somerson who served in the role from 2015 to 2021.

== Rankings and admission ==
In 2014, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked RISD first amongst fine arts programs nationwide. In 2020, graduate programs in Graphic Design, Painting, Sculpture, and Photography, among others, were ranked in the top 5 nationally, however, in 2023, RISD announced its withdrawal from the rankings, citing its inability to accurately assess art and design education, while also running counter to principles of social equity and inclusion. The school&#x27;s undergraduate architecture program ranked 6 in DesignIntelligence&#x27;s ranking of the Top Architecture Schools in the US for 2019. In 2018, the institution was also named among &quot;Forbes&quot;″ America&#x27;s Top Colleges and the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;″s Top Producers of US Fulbright Scholars.

RISD&#x27;s acceptance rate is 19%. In August 2019, the school announced it would be adopting a test-optional policy for admissions.

==Campus==
In the past, RISD buildings were mostly located at the western edge of College Hill, between the Brown University campus and the Providence River. In recent decades, RISD has acquired or built buildings on the downslope nearer the river, or in Downtown Providence just on the other side of the waterway. The main library, undergrad dormitories, and graduate studios of the college are now located downtown.

==RISD Museum==

The RISD Museum was founded in 1877 on the belief that art, artists, and the institutions that support them play pivotal roles in promoting broad civic engagement and creating more open societies. With a permanent collection numbering approximately 100,000 works, the RISD museum is the third largest art museum attached to an educational facility.

==Athletics==
RISD has many athletic clubs and teams. The hockey team is called the &quot;Nads&quot;, and their cheer is &quot;Go Nads!&quot; The logo for the Nads features a horizontal hockey stick with two hockey pucks at the end of the stick&#x27;s handle.

The basketball team is known simply as &quot;The Balls&quot;, and their slogan is, &quot;When the heat is on, the Balls stick together!&quot; The Balls&#x27; logo consists of two balls next to one another in an irregularly shaped net.

Lest the sexual innuendo of these team names and logos be lost or dismissed, the 2001 creation of the school&#x27;s unofficial mascot, Scrotie, ended any ambiguity. Despite the name, Scrotie is not merely a representation of a scrotum, but is a 7-foot tall penis.

The school&#x27;s color is a vivid blue.

<doc id="581449" wikidata="Q320927" url="?curid=581449" title="Martin Seligman">
<text>Martin Elias Peter Seligman (; born August 12, 1942) is an American psychologist, educator, and author of self-help books. Seligman is a strong promoter within the scientific community of his theories of well-being and positive psychology. His theory of learned helplessness is popular among scientific and clinical psychologists. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Seligman as the 31st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

Seligman is the Zellerbach Family Professor of Psychology in the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Department of Psychology. He was previously the Director of the Clinical Training Program in the department, and earlier taught at Cornell University. He is the director of the university&#x27;s Positive Psychology Center. Seligman was elected president of the American Psychological Association for 1998. He is the founding editor-in-chief of &quot;Prevention and Treatment&quot; (the APA electronic journal) and is on the board of advisers of &quot;Parents&quot; magazine.

Seligman has written about positive psychology topics in books such as &quot;The Optimistic Child&quot;, &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, &quot;Learned Optimism&quot;, &quot;Authentic Happiness&quot;, and &quot;Flourish&quot;. His most recent book, &quot;Tomorrowmind&quot;, co-written with Gabriella Rosen Kellerman, was published in 2023.

==Early life and education==
Seligman was born in Albany, New York, to a Jewish family. He was educated at a public school and at The Albany Academy. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy at Princeton University in 1964, graduating &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. and a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1967. In June 1989, Seligman received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden.

==Learned helplessness==

Seligman&#x27;s foundational experiments and theory of &quot;learned helplessness&quot; began at University of Pennsylvania in 1967, as an extension of his interest in depression. Seligman and colleagues accidentally discovered that the experimental conditioning protocol they used with dogs led to behaviors which were unexpected, in that under the experimental conditions, the recently conditioned dogs did not respond to opportunities to learn to escape from an unpleasant situation (&#x27;electric shocks of moderate intensity&#x27;). A fictionalised account of the experiment, and illustration of anti-vivisection arguments about the ethics of electrocuting dogs in the name of psychological research, occur in clinical psychologist Guy Holmes&#x27; novel The Black Dogs of Glaslyn. At the time, and in subsequent years, very little ethical critique of the experiment was published, although definitional and conceptual issues were critiqued.

Seligman developed the theory further, finding learned helplessness to be a psychological condition in which a human being or an animal has learned to act or behave helplessly in a particular situation—usually after experiencing some inability to avoid an adverse situation—even when it actually &quot;has&quot; the power to change its unpleasant or even harmful circumstance. Seligman saw a similarity with severely depressed patients, and argued that clinical depression and related mental illnesses result in part from a perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation. In later years, alongside Abramson, Seligman reformulated his theory of learned helplessness to include attributional style.

==Happiness==
In his 2002 book &quot;Authentic Happiness&quot;, Seligman saw happiness as made up of positive emotion, engagement and meaning.

==Positive psychology==
Seligman worked with Christopher Peterson to create what they describe as a &quot;positive&quot; counterpart to the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (&quot;DSM&quot;). While the &quot;DSM&quot; focuses on what can go wrong, &quot;Character Strengths and Virtues&quot; (2004) is designed to look at what can go right. In their research they looked across cultures and across millennia to attempt to distill a manageable list of virtues that have been highly valued from ancient China and India, through Greece and Rome, to contemporary Western cultures.

Their list includes six character strengths: &quot;wisdom/knowledge&quot;, &quot;courage&quot;, &quot;humanity&quot;, &quot;justice&quot;, &quot;temperance&quot;, and &quot;transcendence&quot;. Each of these has three to five sub-entries; for instance, &quot;temperance&quot; includes &quot;forgiveness&quot;, &quot;humility&quot;, &quot;prudence&quot;, and &quot;self-regulation&quot;. The authors do not believe that there is a hierarchy for the six virtues; no one is more fundamental than or a precursor to the others.

==Well-being==
In his book &quot;Flourish&quot;, 2011, Seligman wrote on &quot;Well-Being Theory&quot;, and said, with respect to how he measures well-being:

Each element of well-being must itself have three properties to count as an element:

# It contributes to well-being.
# Many people pursue it for its own sake, not merely to get any of the other elements.
# It is defined and measured independently of the other elements.

Seligman concluded that there are five elements to &quot;well-being&quot;, which fall under the mnemonic PERMA:

* Positive emotion—Can only be assessed subjectively
* Engagement—Like positive emotion, can &quot;only &quot;be measured through subjective means. It is presence of a flow state
* Relationships—The presence of friends, family, intimacy, or social connection
* Meaning—Belonging to and serving something bigger than one&#x27;s self
* Achievement—Accomplishment that is pursued even when it brings no positive emotion, no meaning, and nothing in the way of positive relationships.

These theories have not been empirically validated.

In July 2011, Seligman encouraged the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, to look into well-being as well as financial wealth in ways of assessing the prosperity of a nation. On July 6, 2011, Seligman appeared on &quot;Newsnight&quot; and was interviewed by Jeremy Paxman about his ideas and his interest in the concept of well-being.

The Master of Applied Positive Psychology (MAPP) program at the University of Pennsylvania was established under the leadership of Seligman as the first educational initiative of the Positive Psychology Center in 2003.

==Personal life==
Seligman plays bridge and finished second in the 1998 installment of one of the three major North American pair championships, the Blue Ribbon Pairs, as well as having won over 50 regional championships.

Seligman has seven children, four grandchildren, and two dogs. He and his second wife, Mandy, live in a house that was once occupied by Eugene Ormandy. They have home-schooled five of their seven children.

Seligman was inspired by the work of the psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck at the University of Pennsylvania in refining his own cognitive techniques and exercises.

<doc id="581451" wikidata="Q5982149" url="?curid=581451" title="Ian Macfarlane (politician)">
<text>Ian Elgin Macfarlane (born 5 April 1955) is an Australian former politician who was a member of the House of Representatives from 1998 to 2016, representing the Liberal Party. He served as a minister in the Howard and Abbott governments.

Macfarlane was born in Kingaroy, Queensland, and was a farmer before entering politics. He was elected to parliament at the 1998 federal election, representing the Division of Groom. Macfarlane was appointed Minister for Small Business in January 2001. After the 2001 election, he was made Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, a position he held until the Howard government&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 election. Macfarlane returned to cabinet in 2013 as Minister for Industry (later Industry and Science) in the Abbott government. He lost his position when Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister in September 2015, and retired from politics at the 2016 election. He is currently chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council.

==Early life==
Macfarlane was born in Kingaroy, Queensland, and was a farmer and president of the Queensland Graingrowers Association before entering politics. He acquired the nickname &quot;Chainsaw&quot; from ABC rural reporter Judy Kennedy due to his raspy voice. He now attributes the moniker to his ability to &quot;cut through red tape&quot;, and it was alluded to in his 1998 election campaign through the slogan &quot;The Right Voice for Groom&quot;.

==Politics==
Macfarlane was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election, representing the Division of Groom for the Liberal Party. As a minister in the Coalition government under John Howard he held the portfolio of Minister for Small Business from January 2001, before being promoted to the Cabinet role of Industry, Tourism and Resources in November 2001. After the defeat of the Coalition in the 2007 federal election he served in the shadow portfolios of Trade as well as Infrastructure and Water, and was the Shadow Minister for Energy and Resources.

In an interview with &quot;Four Corners&quot; on 9 November 2009, Macfarlane said that his position on global warming had changed &quot;a bit&quot;, since he had recognised a greater importance for mankind&#x27;s contribution. Acting as Climate Change Spokesman for the Coalition in 2009, he spent 5 weeks in negotiations around a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme with Minister for Climate Change Penny Wong, before a leadership spill deposed party leader Malcolm Turnbull and replaced him with Tony Abbott, and the policy was overturned.

With the election of the Abbott Coalition government in September 2013 he was appointed Minister for Industry. He was later sworn in as the Minister for Industry and Science on 23 December 2014. Upon the ascension of the Turnbull government in September 2015, he was dropped from the new ministry despite being a Turnbull supporter. On 3 December 2015, Macfarlane announced his intention to sit with the federal Nationals. He claimed that his experience representing regional interests was &quot;second only to&quot; retiring federal Nationals leader and fellow Queenslander Warren Truss. Although local party members overwhelmingly supported Macfarlane&#x27;s decision, the Liberal National Party of Queensland executive blocked the move. LNP officials said that even with the overwhelming support of LNP members in Macfarlane&#x27;s seat, &quot;the interests of our party beyond his electorate&quot; required that Macfarlane stay in the Liberal party room.

On 15 February 2016, Macfarlane announced he would retire from parliament and not contest the 2016 federal election.

==Later career==
In September 2016, it was announced that Macfarlane had been appointed chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council. Greens Senators Larissa Waters and Lee Rhiannon claimed that the appointment seemed to breach the current statement of ministerial standards, which requires that ex-ministers not engage in lobbying for an eighteen-month period after ceasing to be a minister. Macfarlane is also chairman of the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre, a position he has held since May 2016.

Despite retaining his position as Chief Executive of the Queensland Resources Council, in which he lobbies on behalf of some of Australia&#x27;s largest carbon emitters, in late 2021 the Morrison government appointed Macfarlane to the board of the CSIRO, Australia&#x27;s lead science agency. As head of that Council, he authorised an ad campaign against the Queensland Government&#x27;s coal royalty policy (calling it a &quot;tax&quot;), even though his former political party was happy with the policy. The campaign, extending over more than a year, cost over A$40m.

<doc id="581452" wikidata="Q16966797" url="?curid=581452" title="War Industries Board">
<text>The War Industries Board (WIB) was a United States government agency established on July 28, 1917, during World War I, to coordinate the purchase of war supplies between the War Department (Department of the Army) and the Navy Department. Because the United States Department of Defense (The Pentagon) would only come into existence in 1947, this was an ad hoc construction to promote cooperation between the Army and the Navy (with regard to procurement), it was founded by the Council of National Defense (which on its turn came into existence by the appropriation bill of August 1916). The &quot;War Industries Board&quot; was preceded by the General Munitions Board —which didn&#x27;t have the authority it needed and was later strengthened and transformed into the WIB.

Under the War Industries Board, industrial production in the U.S. increased 20 percent. However, the vast majority of the war material was produced too late to do any good.

Despite its relatively brief existence, the WIB was a major step in the development of national planning and government-business cooperation in the United States, and its precedents —like the National Recovery Administration— were influential during the New Deal and World War II.

<text>Strabismus is an eye disorder in which the eyes do not properly align with each other when looking at an object. The eye that is pointed at an object can alternate. The condition may be present occasionally or constantly. If present during a large part of childhood, it may result in amblyopia, or lazy eyes, and loss of depth perception. If onset is during adulthood, it is more likely to result in double vision.
Strabismus can occur due to muscle dysfunction (e.g., myasthenia gravis), farsightedness, problems in the brain, trauma, or infections. Risk factors include premature birth, cerebral palsy, and a family history of the condition. Types include esotropia, where the eyes are crossed (&quot;cross eyed&quot;); exotropia, where the eyes diverge (&quot;lazy eyed&quot; or &quot;wall eyed&quot;); and hypertropia or hypotropia where they are vertically misaligned. They can also be classified by whether the problem is present in all directions a person looks (comitant) or varies by direction (incomitant). Diagnosis may be made by observing the light reflecting from the person&#x27;s eyes and finding that it is not centered on the pupil. This is known as the Hirschberg reflex. Another condition that produces similar symptoms is a cranial nerve disease.
Treatment depends on the type of strabismus and the underlying cause. This may include the use of glasses and possibly surgery. Some types benefit from early surgery. Strabismus occurs in about 2% of children. The term comes from the Ancient Greek word (&quot;&quot;), meaning &#x27;a squinting&#x27;. Other terms for the condition include &quot;squint&quot; and &quot;cast of the eye&quot;.

== Signs and symptoms ==
When observing a person with strabismus, the misalignment of the eyes may be quite apparent. A person with a constant eye turn of significant magnitude is very easy to notice. However, a small magnitude or intermittent strabismus can easily be missed upon casual observation. In any case, an eye care professional can conduct various tests, such as cover testing, to determine the full extent of the strabismus.

Symptoms of strabismus include double vision and eye strain. To avoid double vision, the brain may adapt by ignoring one eye. In this case, often no noticeable symptoms are seen other than a minor loss of depth perception. This deficit may not be noticeable in someone who has had strabismus since birth or early childhood, as they have likely learned to judge depth and distances using monocular cues. However, a constant unilateral strabismus causing constant suppression is a risk for amblyopia in children. Small-angle and intermittent strabismus are more likely to cause disruptive visual symptoms. In addition to headaches and eye strain, symptoms may include an inability to read comfortably, fatigue when reading, and unstable or &quot;jittery&quot; vision.

=== Psychosocial effects ===


People of all ages who have noticeable strabismus may experience psychosocial difficulties. Attention has also been drawn to potential socioeconomic impact resulting from cases of detectable strabismus. A socioeconomic consideration exists as well in the context of decisions regarding strabismus treatment, including efforts to re-establish binocular vision and the possibility of stereopsis recovery.

One study has shown that strabismic children commonly exhibit behaviors marked by higher degrees of inhibition, anxiety, and emotional distress, often leading to outright emotional disorders. These disorders are often related to a negative perception of the child by peers. This is due not only to an altered aesthetic appearance but also because of the inherent symbolic nature of the eye and gaze and the vitally important role they play in an individual&#x27;s life as social components. For some, these issues improved dramatically following strabismus surgery. Notably, strabismus interferes with normal eye contact, often causing embarrassment, anger, and feelings of awkwardness, thereby affecting social communication in a fundamental way, with a possible negative effect on self esteem.

Children with strabismus, particularly those with exotropia, an outward turn, may be more likely to develop a mental health disorder than normal-sighted children. Researchers have theorized that esotropia (an inward turn) was not found to be linked to a higher propensity for mental illness due to the age range of the participants, as well as the shorter follow-up time period; esotropic children were monitored to a mean age of 15.8 years, compared with 20.3 years for the exotropic group.

Investigations have highlighted the impact that strabismus may typically have on quality of life. Studies in which subjects were shown images of strabismic and non-strabismic persons showed a strong negative bias towards those visibly displaying the condition, clearly demonstrating the potential for future socioeconomic implications with regard to employability, as well as other psychosocial effects related to an individual&#x27;s overall happiness.

Adult and child observers perceived a right heterotropia as more disturbing than a left heterotropia, and child observers perceived an esotropia as &quot;worse&quot; than an exotropia. Successful surgical correction of strabismus, for adult as well as children, has been shown to have a significantly positive effect on psychological well-being.

Very little research exists regarding coping strategies employed by adult strabismics. One study categorized coping methods into three subcategories: avoidance (refraining from participation in an activity), distraction (deflecting attention from the condition), and adjustment (approaching an activity differently). The authors of the study suggested that individuals with strabismus may benefit from psychosocial support such as interpersonal skills training. No studies have evaluated whether psychosocial interventions have had any benefits on individuals undergoing strabismus surgery.

== Pathophysiology ==
The extraocular muscles control the position of the eyes. Thus, a problem with the muscles or the nerves controlling them can cause paralytic strabismus. The extraocular muscles are controlled by cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. An impairment of cranial nerve III causes the associated eye to deviate down and out and may or may not affect the size of the pupil. Impairment of cranial nerve IV, which can be congenital, causes the associated eye to drift up and perhaps slightly inward. Sixth nerve palsy causes the associated eye to deviate inward and has many causes due to the relatively long path of the nerve. Increased cranial pressure can compress the nerve as it runs between the clivus and brain stem.

Evidence indicates a cause for strabismus may lie with the input provided to the visual cortex.

Amblyopia may also cause strabismus. If a great difference in clarity occurs between the images from the right and left eyes, input may be insufficient to correctly reposition the eyes. Other causes of a visual difference between right and left eyes, such as asymmetrical cataracts, refractive error, or other eye disease, can also cause or worsen strabismus.

== Diagnosis ==

During an eye examination, a test such as cover testing or the Hirschberg test is used in the diagnosis and measurement of strabismus and its impact on vision. Retinal birefringence scanning can be used for screening of young children for eye misalignment. A Cochrane review to examine different types of diagnosis test found only one study. This study used a photoscreener which was found to have high specificity (accurate in identifying those without the condition) but low sensitivity (inaccurate in identifying those with the condition).

Several classifications are made when diagnosing strabismus.

=== Latency ===
Strabismus can be manifest (&quot;-tropia&quot;) or latent (&quot;-phoria&quot;). A manifest deviation, or heterotropia (which may be &quot;eso-&quot;, &quot;exo-&quot;, &quot;hyper-&quot;, &quot;hypo-&quot;, &quot;cyclotropia&quot; or a combination of these), is present while the person views a target binocularly, with no occlusion of either eye. The person is unable to align the gaze of each eye to achieve fusion. A latent deviation, or heterophoria (&quot;eso-&quot;, &quot;exo-&quot;, &quot;hyper-&quot;, &quot;hypo-&quot;, &quot;cyclophoria&quot; or a combination of these), is only present after binocular vision has been interrupted, typically by covering one eye. This type of person can typically maintain fusion despite the misalignment that occurs when the positioning system is relaxed. Intermittent strabismus is a combination of both of these types, where the person can achieve fusion, but occasionally or frequently falters to the point of a manifest deviation.

=== Onset ===
Strabismus may also be classified based on time of onset, either congenital, acquired, or secondary to another pathological process. Many infants are born with their eyes slightly misaligned, and this is typically outgrown by six to 12 months of age. Acquired and secondary strabismus develop later. The onset of accommodative esotropia, an overconvergence of the eyes due to the effort of accommodation, is mostly in early childhood. Acquired non-accommodative strabismus and secondary strabismus are developed after normal binocular vision has developed. In adults with previously normal alignment, the onset of strabismus usually results in double vision.

Any disease that causes vision loss may also cause strabismus, but it can also result from any severe and/or traumatic injury to the affected eye. Sensory strabismus is strabismus due to vision loss or impairment, leading to horizontal, vertical or torsional misalignment or to a combination thereof, with the eye with poorer vision drifting slightly over time. Most often, the outcome is horizontal misalignment. Its direction depends on the person&#x27;s age at which the damage occurs: people whose vision is lost or impaired at birth are more likely to develop esotropia, whereas people with acquired vision loss or impairment mostly develop exotropia. In the extreme, complete blindness in one eye generally leads to the blind eye reverting to an anatomical position of rest.

Although many possible causes of strabismus are known, among them severe and/or traumatic injuries to the affected eye, in many cases no specific cause can be identified. This last is typically the case when strabismus is present since early childhood.

Results of a U.S. cohort study indicate that the incidence of adult-onset strabismus increases with age, especially after the sixth decade of life, and peaks in the eighth decade of life, and that the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with adult-onset strabismus is approximately 4%.

=== Laterality ===

Strabismus may be classified as unilateral if the one eye consistently deviates, or alternating if either of the eyes can be seen to deviate. Alternation of the strabismus may occur spontaneously, with or without subjective awareness of the alternation. Alternation may also be triggered by various tests during an eye exam. Unilateral strabismus has been observed to result from a severe or traumatic injury to the affected eye.

=== Direction and latency ===
Horizontal deviations are classified into two varieties, using prefixes: &quot;eso-&quot; describes inward or convergent deviations towards the midline, while &quot;exo-&quot; describes outward or divergent misalignment. Vertical deviations are also classified into two varieties, using prefixes: &quot;hyper-&quot; is the term for an eye whose gaze is directed higher than the fellow eye, while &quot;hypo-&quot; refers to an eye whose gaze is directed lower. Finally, the prefix &quot;cyclo-&quot; refers to torsional strabismus, which occurs when the eyes rotate around the anterior–posterior axis to become misaligned and is quite rare.

These five directional prefixes are combined with &quot;-tropia&quot; (if manifest) or &quot;-phoria&quot; (if latent) to describe various types of strabismus. For example, a constant left hypertropia exists when a person&#x27;s left eye is always aimed higher than the right. A person with an intermittent right esotropia has a right eye that occasionally drifts toward the person&#x27;s nose, but at other times is able to align with the gaze of the left eye. A person with a mild exophoria can maintain fusion during normal circumstances, but when the system is disrupted, the relaxed posture of the eyes is slightly divergent.

=== Other considerations ===
Strabismus can be further classified as follows:
* Paretic strabismus is due to paralysis of one or several extraocular muscles.
* Nonparetic strabismus is not due to paralysis of extraocular muscles.
* Comitant (or &quot;concomitant&quot;) strabismus is a deviation that is the same magnitude regardless of gaze position.
* Noncomitant (or &quot;incomitant&quot;) strabismus has a magnitude that varies as the person shifts his or her gaze up, down, or to the sides.

Nonparetic strabismus is generally concomitant. Most types of infant and childhood strabismus are comitant. Paretic strabismus can be either comitant or noncomitant. Incomitant strabismus is almost always caused by a limitation of ocular rotations that is due to a restriction of extraocular eye movement (ocular restriction) or due to extraocular muscle paresis. Incomitant strabismus cannot be fully corrected by prism glasses, because the eyes would require different degrees of prismatic correction dependent on the direction of the gaze. Incomitant strabismus of the eso- or exo-type are classified as &quot;alphabet patterns&quot;: they are denoted as A- or V- or more rarely λ-, Y- or X-pattern depending on the extent of convergence or divergence when the gaze moves upward or downward. These letters of the alphabet denote ocular motility pattern that have a similarity to the respective letter: in the A-pattern there is (relatively speaking) more convergence when the gaze is directed upwards and more divergence when it is directed downwards, in the V-pattern it is the contrary, in the λ-, Y- and X-patterns there is little or no strabismus in the middle position but relatively more divergence in one or both of the upward and downward positions, depending on the &quot;shape&quot; of the letter.

Types of incomitant strabismus include: Duane syndrome, horizontal gaze palsy, and congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles.

When the misalignment of the eyes is large and obvious, the strabismus is called large-angle, referring to the angle of deviation between the lines of sight of the eyes. Less severe eye turns are called small-angle strabismus. The degree of strabismus can vary based on whether the person is viewing a distant or near target.

Strabismus that sets in after eye alignment had been surgically corrected is called &quot;consecutive strabismus&quot;.

===Differential diagnosis===
Pseudostrabismus is the false appearance of strabismus. It generally occurs in infants and toddlers whose bridge of the nose is wide and flat, causing the appearance of esotropia due to less sclera being visible nasally. With age, the bridge of the child&#x27;s nose narrows and the folds in the corner of the eyes become less prominent.

Retinoblastoma may also result in abnormal light reflection from the eye.

== Management ==

Strabismus is usually treated with a combination of eyeglasses, vision therapy, and surgery, depending on the underlying reason for the misalignment. As with other binocular vision disorders, the primary goal is comfortable, single, clear, normal binocular vision at all distances and directions of gaze.

===Glasses===
In cases of accommodative esotropia, the eyes turn inward due to the effort of focusing far-sighted eyes, and the treatment of this type of strabismus necessarily involves refractive correction, which is usually done via corrective glasses or contact lenses, and in these cases surgical alignment is considered only if such correction does not resolve the eye turn.

In case of strong anisometropia, contact lenses may be preferable to spectacles because they avoid the problem of visual disparities due to size differences (aniseikonia) which is otherwise caused by spectacles in which the refractive power is very different for the two eyes. In a few cases of strabismic children with anisometropic amblyopia, a balancing of the refractive error eyes via refractive surgery has been performed before strabismus surgery was undertaken.

Early treatment of strabismus when the person is a baby may reduce the chance of developing amblyopia and depth perception problems. However, a review of randomized controlled trials concluded that the use of corrective glasses to prevent strabismus is not supported by existing research. Amblyopia has long been considered to remain permanent if not treated within a critical period, namely before the age of about seven years.

Glasses affect the position by changing the person&#x27;s reaction to focusing. Prisms change the way light, and therefore images, strike the eye, simulating a change in the eye position.

===Surgery===
Strabismus surgery does not remove the need for a child to wear glasses. Currently it is unknown whether there are any differences for completing strabismus surgery before or after amblyopia therapy in children.

Strabismus surgery attempts to align the eyes by shortening, lengthening, or changing the position of one or more of the extraocular eye muscles. The procedure can typically be performed in about an hour, and requires about six to eight weeks for recovery. Adjustable sutures may be used to permit refinement of the eye alignment in the early postoperative period. It is unclear if there are differences between adjustable versus non-adjustable sutures as it has not been sufficiently studied. An alternative to the classical procedure is minimally invasive strabismus surgery (MISS) that uses smaller incisions than usual.

===Medication===
Medication is used for strabismus in certain circumstances. In 1989, the US FDA approved botulinum toxin therapy for strabismus in people over 12 years old. Most commonly used in adults, the technique is also used for treating children, in particular children affected by infantile esotropia. The toxin is injected in the stronger muscle, causing temporary and partial paralysis. The treatment may need to be repeated three to four months later once the paralysis wears off. Common side effects are double vision, droopy eyelid, overcorrection, and no effect. The side effects typically resolve also within three to four months. Botulinum toxin therapy has been reported to be similarly successful as strabismus surgery for people with binocular vision and less successful than surgery for those who have no binocular vision.

== Prognosis ==
When strabismus is congenital or develops in infancy, it can cause amblyopia, in which the brain ignores input from the deviated eye. Even with therapy for amblyopia, stereoblindness may occur. The appearance of strabismus may also be a cosmetic problem. One study reported 85% of adults with strabismus &quot;reported that they had problems with work, school, and sports because of their strabismus.&quot; The same study also reported 70% said strabismus &quot;had a negative effect on their self-image.&quot; A second operation is sometimes required to straighten the eyes.

==In other animals==
Siamese cats and related breeds are prone to having crossed eyes. Research suggests this is a behavioral compensation for developmental abnormalities in the routing of nerves in the optic chiasm.

Strabismus may also occur in dogs, most often due to imbalanced muscle tone of the muscles surrounding the eye. Some breeds such as the Shar Pei are genetically predisposed to the condition. Treatment may involve surgery or therapy to strengthen the muscles.

<text>Jann Sonya McFarlane (born 22 May 1944) is a former Australian politician. She was a member of the House of Representatives from 1998 to 2004, representing the Western Australian seat of Stirling for the Australian Labor Party (ALP).

==Early life==
McFarlane was born in Sydney on 22 May 1944. Her father abandoned the family when she was a small child and her mother remarried in the early 1950s. She grew up in a rural area and her family &quot;struggled with domestic violence, alcoholism and poverty&quot;.

After leaving school McFarlane worked as a cleaner, secretary and clerk. She later completed a Bachelor of Arts at Macquarie University as a mature-age student and began working in the community sector. Prior to her election to parliament she had worked at a community legal centre and welfare rights centre for six years.

==Politics==
McFarlane joined the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1978. She was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election, defeating the incumbent Liberal MP Eoin Cameron in the seat of Stirling.

McFarlane was re-elected at the 2001 election but lost her seat to the Liberal candidate Michael Keenan at the 2004 election. During the election campaign she attracted attention for a gaffe in which she implied that the ALP&#x27;s tax policies announced by opposition leader Mark Latham would need to be &quot;adjusted&quot;. She subsequently released a statement retracting her comments.

In 2006, McFarlane was investigated by the Department of Finance over allegations she had misused electoral entitlements to allow constituents to make long-distance calls. She stated that she &quot;utterly denied and refuted the allegations&quot;.

==Personal life==
McFarlane was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2004 and underwent surgery.

<doc id="581459" wikidata="Q207855" url="?curid=581459" title="Amblyopia">
<text>Amblyopia, also called lazy eye, is a disorder of sight in which the brain fails to fully process input from one eye and over time favors the other eye. It results in decreased vision in an eye that typically appears normal in other aspects. Amblyopia is the most common cause of decreased vision in a single eye among children and younger adults.
The cause of amblyopia can be any condition that interferes with focusing during early childhood. This can occur from poor alignment of the eyes (strabismic), an eye being irregularly shaped such that focusing is difficult, one eye being more nearsighted or farsighted than the other (refractive), or clouding of the lens of an eye (deprivational). After the underlying cause is addressed, vision is not restored right away, as the mechanism also involves the brain. Amblyopia can be difficult to detect, so vision testing is recommended for all children around the ages of four to five.
Early detection improves treatment success. Glasses may be all the treatment needed for some children. If this is not sufficient, treatments which encourage or force the child to use the weaker eye are used. This is done by either using a patch or putting atropine in the stronger eye. Without treatment, amblyopia typically persists. Treatment in adulthood is usually much less effective.
Amblyopia begins by the age of five. In adults, the disorder is estimated to affect 1–5% of the population. While treatment improves vision, it does not typically restore it to normal in the affected eye. Amblyopia was first described in the 1600s. The condition may make people ineligible to be pilots or police officers. The word &quot;amblyopia&quot; is from Greek ἀμβλύς &quot;amblys&quot;, meaning &quot;blunt&quot;, and ὤψ &quot;ōps&quot;, meaning &quot;sight&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Many people with amblyopia, especially those who only have a mild form, are not aware they have the condition until tested at older ages, since the vision in their stronger eye is normal. People with amblyopia typically have poor stereo vision, since it requires both eyes. They further may have, on the affected eye, poor pattern recognition, poor visual acuity, and low sensitivity to contrast and motion.

Amblyopia is characterized by several functional abnormalities in spatial vision, including reductions in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity function, and vernier acuity, as well as spatial distortion, abnormal spatial interactions, and impaired contour detection. In addition, individuals with amblyopia have binocular abnormalities such as impaired stereoacuity (stereoscopic acuity) and abnormal binocular summation. Also, central vision in amblyopes is more crowded than central vision in normal observers.

These deficits are usually specific to the amblyopic eye. Subclinical deficits of the &quot;better&quot; eye have also been demonstrated.

People with amblyopia also have problems of binocular vision such as limited stereoscopic depth perception and usually have difficulty seeing the three-dimensional images in hidden stereoscopic displays such as autostereograms. Perception of depth, from monocular cues such as size, perspective, and motion parallax remains normal.

==Cause==
Amblyopia, often referred to as &quot;lazy eye,&quot; can be categorized into three types:

# Deprivation Amblyopia: This occurs when something obstructs light from entering the eye, preventing proper vision development. A congenital cataract is an example of such a condition.
# Strabismic Amblyopia: The most common form, this type arises when the eyes are not properly aligned, leading to double vision. To avoid confusion, the brain compensates by ignoring the visual input from the misaligned eye.
# Refractive Amblyopia: This type is caused by a significant difference in uncorrected refractive errors, such as nearsightedness or farsightedness, between the two eyes.

===Strabismus===

Strabismus, sometimes also incorrectly called lazy eye, is a condition in which the eyes are misaligned. Strabismus usually results in normal vision in the preferred sighting (or &quot;fellow&quot;) eye (the eye that the person prefers to use), but may cause abnormal vision in the deviating or strabismic eye due to the difference between the images projecting to the brain from the two eyes.
Adult-onset strabismus usually causes double vision (diplopia), since the two eyes are not fixed on the same object.
Children&#x27;s brains are more neuroplastic, so can more easily adapt by suppressing images from one of the eyes, eliminating the double vision. This plastic response of the brain interrupts the brain&#x27;s normal development, resulting in the amblyopia. Recent evidence points to a cause of infantile strabismus lying with the input to the visual cortex.

Those with strabismic amblyopia tend to show ocular motion deficits when reading, even when they use the nonamblyopic eye. In particular, they tend to make more saccades per line than persons with normal stereo vision, and to have a reduced reading speed, especially when reading a text with small font size.

Strabismic amblyopia is treated by clarifying the visual image with glasses, or encouraging use of the amblyopic eye with an eyepatch over the dominant eye or pharmacologic penalization of the better eye. Penalization usually consists of applying atropine drops to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex, leading to the blurring of vision in the good eye. It also dilates the pupil. This helps to prevent the bullying and teasing associated with wearing a patch, although sometimes application of the eye drops is challenging. The ocular alignment itself may be treated with surgical or nonsurgical methods, depending on the type and severity of the strabismus.

===Refractive===
Refractive amblyopia may result from anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes). Anisometropia exists when there is a difference in the power between the two eyes. The eye which provides the brain with a clearer image typically becomes the dominant eye. The image in the other eye is blurred, which results in abnormal development of one half of the visual system. Refractive amblyopia is usually less severe than strabismic amblyopia and is commonly missed by primary care physicians because of its less dramatic appearance and lack of obvious physical manifestation, such as with strabismus. Given that the refractive correction of anisometropia by means of spectacles typically leads to different image magnification for the two eyes, which may in turn prevent binocular vision, a refractive correction using contact lenses is to be considered. Also pediatric refractive surgery is a treatment option, in particular if conventional approaches have failed due to aniseikonia or lack of compliance or both.

Frequently, amblyopia is associated with a combination of anisometropia and strabismus. In some cases, the vision between the eyes can differ to the point where one eye has twice average vision while the other eye is completely blind.

=== Deprivation and occlusion ===
Deprivation amblyopia (amblyopia ex anopsia) results when the ocular media become opaque, such as is the case with congenital cataract or corneal haziness. These opacities prevent adequate visual input from reaching the eye, and disrupt development. If not treated in a timely fashion, amblyopia may persist even after the cause of the opacity is removed. Sometimes, drooping of the eyelid (ptosis) or some other problem causes the upper eyelid to physically occlude a child&#x27;s vision, which may cause amblyopia quickly. Occlusion amblyopia may be a complication of a hemangioma that blocks some or all of the eye. Other possible causes of deprivation and occlusion amblyopia include obstruction in the vitreous and aphakia. Deprivation amblyopia accounts for less than 3% of all individuals affected by amblyopia.

==Pathophysiology==
Amblyopia is a developmental problem in the brain, not any intrinsic, organic neurological problem in the eyeball (although organic problems can lead to amblyopia which can continue to exist after the organic problem has resolved by medical intervention).
The part of the brain receiving images from the affected eye is not stimulated properly and does not develop to its full visual potential. This has been confirmed by direct brain examination. David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1981 for their work in showing the extent of the damage to ocular dominance columns produced in kittens by sufficient visual deprivation during the so-called &quot;critical period&quot;. The maximum &quot;critical period&quot; in humans is from birth to two years old.

==Diagnosis==
Amblyopia is diagnosed by identifying low visual acuity in one or both eyes, out of proportion to the structural abnormality of the eye and excluding other visual disorders as causes for the lowered visual acuity. It can be defined as an interocular difference of two lines or more in acuity (e.g. on Snellen chart) when the eye optics are maximally corrected. In young children, visual acuity is difficult to measure and can be estimated by observing the reactions of the patient when one eye is covered, including observing the patient&#x27;s ability to follow objects with one eye.

Stereotests like the Lang stereotest are not reliable exclusion tests for amblyopia. A person who passes the Lang stereotest test is unlikely to have strabismic amblyopia, but could nonetheless have refractive or deprivational amblyopia. Binocular retinal birefringence scanning may be able to identify, already in very young children, amblyopia that is associated with strabismus, microstrabismus, or reduced fixation accuracy. Diagnosis and treatment of amblyopia as early as possible is necessary to keep the vision loss to a minimum. Screening for amblyopia is recommended in all people between three and five years of age.

==Treatment==
Treatment of strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia consists of correcting the optical deficit (wearing the necessary spectacle prescription) and often forcing use of the amblyopic eye, by patching the good eye, or instilling topical atropine in the good eye, or both. Atropine appears to result in similar outcomes to patching. If there is overpatching or overpenalizing the good eye when treating amblyopia, &quot;reverse amblyopia&quot; can result. Eye patching is usually done on a part-time schedule of about 4–6 hours a day. Treatment is continued as long as vision improves. It is not worthwhile continuing to patch for more than 6 months if no improvement continues.

Deprivation amblyopia is treated by removing the opacity as soon as possible followed by patching or penalizing the good eye to encourage the use of the amblyopic eye. The earlier the treatment is initiated, the easier and faster the treatment is and the less psychologically damaging. Also, the chance of achieving 20/20 vision is greater if treatment is initiated early.

One of the German public health insurance providers, Barmer, has changed its policy to cover, as of 1 April 2014, the cost of software for amblyopic children whose condition did not improve through patching. The app offers dedicated eye exercises that the patient performs while wearing an eyepatch.

Treatment for amblyopia depends on the child’s age, severity of the vision loss and the prescribing doctor’s preference. Treatment options include, vision therapy, total or partial occlusion therapy, prescription eyeglasses or any combination. Common types of occlusion therapy include the use of eye-patches or optical blurring. Optical blurring can include the use of pharmacological agents (eye drops) or visual degradation using either power to blur the image or foils placed over the lens.

Evidence for vision therapy is unclear as of 2011.

===Older age===
Treatment of individuals age 9 through to adulthood is possible through applied perceptual learning. Tentative evidence shows that perceptual training may be beneficial in adults.

==Epidemiology==
Amblyopia occurs in 2–5% of the population in Western countries. In the UK, 90% of visual health appointments in the child concern amblyopia.

Depending on the chosen criterion for diagnosis, 1–4% of the children have amblyopia.

==Research==
A 2009 study, widely reported in the popular press, suggested that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may temporarily improve contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution in the affected eye of adults with amblyopia. This approach is still under development, and the results await verification by other researchers. Comparable results may be achieved using different types of brain stimulation, such as anodal transcranial direct current stimulation and theta burst rTMS.

A 2013 study concluded that converging evidence indicates decorrelated binocular experience plays a pivotal role in the genesis of amblyopia and the associated residual deficits. Another study of 2013 suggests that playing a version of the popular game Tetris that is modified such that each eye sees separate components of the game may also help to treat this condition in adults. Furthermore, the effects of this kind of therapy may be further enhanced by noninvasive brain stimulation as shown by a recent study using anodal tDCS.

A 2014 Cochrane review sought to determine the effectiveness of occlusion treatment on patients with sensory deprivation amblyopia, but no trials were found eligible to be included in the review. However, good outcomes from occlusion treatment for sensory deprivation amblyopia likely rely on compliance with the treatment.

<text>Diacritics is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal established in 1971 at Cornell University and published by the Johns Hopkins University Press. Articles serve to review recent literature in the field of literary criticism, and have covered topics in gender studies, political theory, psychoanalysis, queer theory, and other areas. The editor-in-chief is Andrea Bachner (Cornell University).

== History ==
The journal was founded by David Grossvogel, who served as the Romance Studies chair at Cornell. Its first issue was published in the Fall of 1971, and Grossvogel served as editor until 1976.

The name “Diacritics” was suggested by Romance Studies professor Emeritus Philip Lewis, who served from 1971 to 1987 as managing and general editor.

<text>Peter John McGauran (born 16 November 1955) is an Australian former politician who served as a National Party member of the Australian House of Representatives. He represented the Division of Gippsland in Victoria from 5 March 1983 to 9 April 2008. He is the brother of former Senator Julian McGauran. He was born in Yallourn, Victoria, and was educated at Xavier College, Kew and the University of Melbourne. He was a barrister and solicitor before entering politics.

McGauran was an active member of the Young Nationals and was accorded the accolade of &#x27;Mr YNP Pin-Up Boy&#x27; at the 1983 NSW Young Nationals State Ball held in Moree.

McGauran was appointed Minister for Science and Technology in the Howard government in 1996, however, on 26 September 1997, he was forced to resign his position due to ministerial impropriety in relation to the &quot;Travel Rorts&quot; affair. He returned to the ministry in 1998, as Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation 1998–2001, Minister for Science 2001–04, and Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 2004–05. In July 2005 he was promoted to Cabinet and became Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, a position he held until 3 December 2007, the Howard Government having been defeated by the Australian Labor Party under Kevin Rudd at the 24 November election.

After the resignation of Nationals leader Mark Vaile, McGauran was expected to seek the leadership; however he dropped out of the race, stating that it was time for younger members to contribute to the party, and that he looked forward to using his experience to help them.

On 4 April 2008, McGauran announced he would shortly be resigning from parliament, citing plans to pursue interests in the thoroughbred racing industry. His resignation was effective on 9 April. He was succeeded by Darren Chester in the resulting June 2008 by-election.

After announcing his resignation, he revealed events that occurred in 1996, where he was physically assaulted by Alphonse Gangitano, an underworld figure who was later murdered. In January 2018, McGauran was appointed by Trade Minister Steven Ciobo as the Consul-General of Australia in Houston, Texas.

<doc id="581471" wikidata="Q131070" url="?curid=581471" title="Oviraptor">
<text>Oviraptor (; ) is a genus of oviraptorid dinosaur that lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous period. The first remains were collected from the Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia in 1923 during a paleontological expedition led by Roy Chapman Andrews, and in the following year the genus and type species Oviraptor philoceratops were named by Henry Fairfield Osborn. The genus name refers to the initial thought of egg-stealing habits, and the specific name was intended to reinforce this view indicating a preference over ceratopsian eggs. Despite the fact that numerous specimens have been referred to the genus, &quot;Oviraptor&quot; is only known from a single partial skeleton regarded as the holotype, as well as a nest of about fifteen eggs and several small fragments from a juvenile.

&quot;Oviraptor&quot; was a rather small feathered oviraptorid, estimated at long with a weight between . It had a wide lower jaw with a skull that likely had a crest. Both upper and lower jaws were toothless and developed a horny beak, which was used during feeding along the robust morphology of the lower jaws. The arms were well-developed and elongated ending in three fingers with curved claws. Like other oviraptorids, &quot;Oviraptor&quot; had long hindlimbs that had four-toed feet, with the first toe reduced. The tail was likely not very elongated, and ended in a pygostyle that supported large feathers.

The initial relationships of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; were poorly understood at the time and was assigned to the unrelated Ornithomimidae by the original describer, Henry Osborn. However, re-examinations made by Rinchen Barsbold proved that &quot;Oviraptor&quot; was distinct enough to warrant a separate family, the Oviraptoridae. When first described, &quot;Oviraptor&quot; was interpreted as an egg-thief, egg-eating dinosaur given the close association of the holotype with a dinosaur nest. However, findings of numerous oviraptorosaurs in nesting poses have demonstrated that this specimen was actually brooding the nest and not stealing nor feeding on the eggs. Moreover, the discovery of remains of a small juvenile or nestling have been reported in association with the holotype specimen, further supporting parental care.

==History of discovery==

The first remains of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; were discovered on reddish sandstones of the Late Cretaceous Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia, at the Bayn Dzak locality (also known as Flaming Cliffs), during the Third Central Asiatic expedition in 1923. This expedition was led by the North American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews and ended in the discovery of three new-to-science theropod fossil remains—including those of &quot;Oviraptor&quot;. These were formally described by the North American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924, who in the basis of the new material, named the genera &quot;Oviraptor&quot;, &quot;Saurornithoides&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. The particular genus &quot;Oviraptor&quot; was erected with the type species &quot;O. philoceratops&quot; based on the holotype AMNH 6517, a partial individual lacking the back of the skeleton but including a badly crushed skull, partial cervical and dorsal vertebrae, pectoral elements including the furcula with the left arm and partial hands, the left ilium and some ribs. Accordingly, this specimen was found lying over a nest of approximately 15 eggs—a nest that has been catalogued as AMNH 6508—with the skull separated from the eggs by only of sediment. Given the close proximity of both specimens, Osborn interpreted &quot;Oviraptor&quot; as a dinosaur with egg-eating habits, and explained that the generic name, &quot;Oviraptor&quot;, is Latin for &quot;egg seizer&quot; or &quot;egg thief&quot;, due to the association of the fossils. The specific name, &quot;philoceratops&quot;, is intended as &quot;fondness for ceratopsian eggs&quot; which is also given as a result of the initial thought of the nest pertaining to &quot;Protoceratops&quot; or another ceratopsian. However, Osborn suggested that the name &quot;Oviraptor&quot; could reflect an incorrect perception of this dinosaur. Furthermore, Osborn found &quot;Oviraptor&quot; to be similar to the unrelated—at the time, however, considered related—fast-running ornithomimids based on the toothless jaws, and assigned &quot;Oviraptor&quot; to the Ornithomimidae. Osborn had previously reported the taxon as &quot;Fenestrosaurus philoceratops&quot;, but this was later discredited.

In 1976, the Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold noted some inconsistencies regarding the taxonomic placement of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; and concluded that this taxon was quite distinct from ornithomimids based on anatomical traits. Under this consideration, he erected the Oviraptoridae to contain &quot;Oviraptor&quot; and close relatives. After Osborn&#x27;s initial description of &quot;Oviraptor&quot;, the egg nest associated with the holotype was accepted to have belonged to &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, and oviraptorids were largely considered to have been egg-eating theropods. Nevertheless, in the 1990s, the discovery of numerous nesting and nestling oviraptorid specimens proved that Osborn was correct in his caution regarding the name of &quot;Oviraptor&quot;. These findings showed that oviraptorids brooded and protected their nests by crouching on them. This new line of evidence showed that the nest associated with the holotype of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; belonged to it and the specimen was actually brooding the eggs at the time of death, not preying on them.

===Referred specimens===

After the naming of Oviraptoridae in 1976, Barsbold referred six additional specimens to &quot;Oviraptor&quot;, including two particular specimens under the number MPC-D 100/20 and 100/21. In 1986, Barsbold realized that the latter two did not belong to the genus and instead they represented a new oviraptorid: &quot;Conchoraptor&quot;. Most of the other specimens are also unlikely to belong to &quot;Oviraptor&quot; itself, and they have been assigned to other oviraptorids. A partial individual also with eggs from the Bayan Mandahu Formation of Mongolia was referred in 1996 by Dong Zhiming and Philip J. Currie, the specimen IVPP V9608. However, in 2010 Nicholas R. Longrich and the two latter paleontologist have expressed their uncertainties regarding this referral as there are several anatomical differences such as the hand phalangeal proportions. They concluded that this specimen was a different and indeterminate species not referrable to this taxon. In 1981, Barsbold referred the specimen MPC-D 100/42 to &quot;Oviraptor&quot;, a very well-preserved and rather complete individual from the Djadokhta Formation. Since the known elements of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; were so fragmentary compared to other members, MPC-D 100/42 became the prime reference/depiction of this taxon being prominently labelled as &quot;Oviraptor philoceratops&quot; in scientific literature.

This conception was refuted by James M. Clark and colleagues in 2002, who noted that this tall-crested specimen has more features of the skull in common with &quot;Citipati&quot; than it does with &quot;Oviraptor&quot;—which in fact, does not preserve a crest—and it may represent a second species of the former, or, an entire new genus. In 1986, Barsbold described a second species of &quot;Oviraptor&quot;, &quot;O. mongoliensis&quot;, based on specimen MPC-D 100/32a which hails from the Nemegt Formation. However, a re-examination by Barsbold in 1997 found enough differences in this specimen to name the new genus &quot;Rinchenia&quot;, but he did not describe it with formality and this new oviraptorid remained as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. This was amended by the Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmólska and team in 2004 by formally naming the taxon &quot;Rinchenia mongoliensis&quot;. The North American paleontologist Mark A. Norell and colleagues in 2018 reported a new specimen of &quot;Oviraptor&quot;: AMNH 33092, which is composed of a tibia and two metatarsals of a nestling or very small juvenile. AMNH 33092 was found in association with the holotype and it was likely part of the nest. &quot;Oviraptor&quot; is now known from the holotype with associated eggs, and a juvenile/nestling.

==Description==

The holotype specimen has been estimated at in length with a weight ranging from . Though the holotype largely lacks the posterior region of the skeleton, it is likely that &quot;Oviraptor&quot; had two well-developed hindlimbs that ended in three functional toes with the first one being vestigial, as well as a relatively reduced tail. As evidenced in related oviraptorids, the arms were covered by elongated feathers, and the tail ended in a pygostyle, which is known to support a fan of feathers.

===Skull===
The skull of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; was deep and shortened with large fenestrae (openings) compared to other dinosaurs, and measures about long as preserved. The actual length may actually be longer though, given that the holotype skull lacks several regions such as the premaxilla. The holotype skull lacks a crest in almost its entirety, however, the top surfaces of the fused parietal and frontal bones indicate that it likely had a well-developed crest, supported by the nasal and premaxilla bones (mainly the latter) of the rostrum. &quot;Oviraptor&quot; had an elongated maxilla and dentary, which may result into a more extended snout compared to the highly stocky jaws of other oviraptorids. The palate is rigid, extended below the jaw line and formed by the premaxillae, vomers, and maxillae. As in other oviraptorids, it may have had a pair of tooth-like projections on the palate that were directed downwards. As in other oviraptorids, the nares (external nostrils) would have been relatively small and placed high on the skull. &quot;Oviraptor&quot; had toothless jaws that ended in a robust, parrot-like rhamphotheca (horny beak). The curvature of the dentary tip was down-turned but less pronounced than other oviraptorids, such as &quot;Citipati&quot;. As a whole, the lower jaw is a short and deep bone that covers .

===Postcranial skeleton===

As in most oviraptorids, the neural spines of the holotype cervical vertebrae were short, and the neural arches were X-shaped. However the spines become more pronounced in posterior vertebrae. The zygapophyses of the first cervical vertebrae are configured parallel to each other, and the postzygapophyses appear to not diverge significantly from the midline, mostly similar to &quot;Citipati&quot;. The cervical ribs are fused to the vertebrae in the holotype. The neural spines are rectangular in the anterior series of the dorsal vertebrae when seen in a lateral view and larger than the spines of the cervicals. On the anteriormost dorsal vertebra several pleurocoels (small air-spaced holes) can be found, which are similar to those of &quot;Khaan&quot;.

The furcula of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; is very distinct from other oviraptorids in having a midline keel on the anterior surface of the hypocleidium−a downwards directed projection at the center of the furcula. This bone is V-shaped, rounded in cross-section, preserves an elongate spike-like hypocleidium, and the interclavicular angle is about 90°. The scapulocoracoid is fused in the holotype, however, the coracoid is badly damaged. The scapula is slightly bowed and measures in length. &quot;Oviraptor&quot; had a relatively elongated arm composed of the humerus, radius, ulna, and manus.

The phalangeal formula of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; was 2-3-4, as seen in most other theropods and oviraptorids. The hand of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; had three skinny and bird-like fingers with each finger ended in side to side flattened and recurved unguals (claw bone). Unlike some oviraptorids, &quot;Oviraptor&quot; did not suffer a reduction of the second and third finger relative to the first one. The regarded juvenile &quot;Oviraptor&quot; AMNH 33092 preserves hindlimb material, comprising a right tibia with metatarsals III and IV. Its tibia is long, indicating a substantially smaller individual than the holotype. The nest AMNH 6508 preserves elongatoolithid eggs, with each egg being long (some are incomplete). Nevertheless, there is the possibility that taphonomical crushing may have compressed them by up to .

==Classification==
&quot;Oviraptor&quot; was originally allied with the ornithomimids by Osborn due to its toothless beak. Osborn also found similarities with &quot;Chirostenotes&quot;, which is still considered a close relative of &quot;Oviraptor&quot;. In 1976, Barsbold erected a new family to contain &quot;Oviraptor&quot; and its close kin, making &quot;Oviraptor&quot; the type genus of the Oviraptoridae. During the redescription of the holotype skull in 2002 by Clark and colleagues, they noted that &quot;Oviraptor&quot; had a relatively elongated maxilla and dentary. These traits are less pronounced in derived oviraptorids and suggests that &quot;Oviraptor&quot; belongs to the near base of the Oviraptoridae.

The cladogram below follows an analysis by Gregory F. Funston and colleagues in 2020:
==Paleobiology==
===Feeding===

When first described in 1924 by Osborn, &quot;Oviraptor&quot; was originally presumed to have been ovivorous—an organism that has an egg-based diet—based on the association of the holotype with a nest thought to belong to &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. In 1977, Barsbold proposed a crushing jaw hypothesis. He argued that the strength of the robust lower jaws and likely rhamphotheca (horny beak) was strong enough to break the shells of mollusks such as clams, which are found in the same geological formation as &quot;Oviraptor&quot;. These bones form part of the main upper jaw bone or maxilla, which converge in the middle to form a pair of prongs. The rhamphotheca and lower jaws together with the extension of several bones from the palate, would have made a piercing tool. Barsbold also suggested that oviraptorids could have had a semiaquatic life-style based on the mollusk-based diet, the high location of nasal cavities, an augmented musculature of the tail, and the greater size of the first manual digit. In a 1990 conference abstract, David K. Smith presented an osteological reevaluation of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; where he rejected the statements made by Barsbold. He found no evidence indicating a forelimb specialized in aquatic locomotion, and the jaws, rather than preserve a crushing mechanism, preserve shearing surfaces. As the skull is toothless, lightly built and lacks several strong muscle insertion areas, Smith suggested that leaves may have been an important part in the diet of &quot;Oviraptor&quot;. However, in 1995, Norell and colleagues reported the fragmented remains of a lizard in the body cavity of the holotype specimen, suggesting that &quot;Oviraptor&quot; was partially carnivorous.

In 2008, Stig Olav K. Jansen compared the skull of several oviraptorid species to those of birds and turtles to investigate which properties can predict a rhamphotheca. He found the lower jaws of oviraptorids to be very similar to those of parrots, and the upper jaws to be more similar to those of turtles. Based on these observations, Jansen suggested that oviraptorids were omnivorous as the sharply-developed rhamphotheca together with the prominent forelimbs would have been adapted to catch and tear small prey. Moreover, the pointed projections of the palate would have contributed in holding prey. Jansen pointed out that a fully herbivorous diet in oviraptorids seems unlikely as they lacked flat and wide tomia (cutting edges of the mandibles) to chew, and were unable to move the lower jaws sideways. However, he considered the lower jaws strong enough to have at least crushed elements like eggs, nuts or other hard seeds.

Longrich and colleagues in 2010 also rejected a durophagous (animals that practise shell-crushing) hypothesis, given that such animals typically develop teeth with broad crushing surfaces. The pointed shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws suggests that oviraptorids had a sharp-edged rhamphotheca used for shearing food instead. The symphyseal (bone union) region at the front of the dentary may have given some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. Another argument against them having been eaters of mollusks is the fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted to represent mostly arid or semi-arid environments, such as &quot;Oviraptor&quot; in the Djadokhta Formation. The team also found that oviraptorids and dicynodonts share cranial features such as short, deep, and toothless mandibles; elongated dentary symphyses; elongated mandibular openings; and a pointed palate. Modern animals with jaws that resemble those of oviraptorids include parrots and tortoises; the latter group also has tooth-like projections on the palatal region. Longrich and colleagues concluded that due to the similarities between oviraptorids and herbivorous animals, the bulk of their diet would most likely have been formed by plant material. The jaws of oviraptorids may have been specialised for processing food, such as xerophytic vegetation−a vegetation that is adapted for environments with little water—that would have grown in their arid environments, but this is not possible to demonstrate, as little is known about the paleoflora of the Gobi Desert.

In 2018 however, Funston and colleagues supported the crushing jaw hypothesis. They pointed out that the stocky rostrum and robust lower jaws of oviraptorids suggest, in fact, a strong and nipping bite, which is rather similar to those of parrots. Funston and colleagues considered these anatomical traits of oviraptorids to be consistent with a frugivorous diet that incorporated nuts and seeds.

===Reproduction===

Since the description of the embryonic &quot;Citipati&quot; specimen in 1994, oviraptorids became more understood: instead of having been egg-eating animals, they actually brooded and cared for the nests. This specimen showed that the holotype of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; was likely a sexually mature individual that perished incubating the associated nest with eggs. This new behavior on oviraptorids became more clear with the report and short description of an adult nesting specimen of &quot;Citipati&quot; in 1995 by Norell and colleagues. The specimen was found on top of egg clutches, with its hindlimbs crouched symmetrically on each side of the nest and the forelimbs covering the nest perimeter. This brooding posture is found today only in modern avian dinosaurs and supports a behavioral link between the latter group and non-avian dinosaurs. In 1996, Dong and Currie described a new nesting oviraptorid specimen from the Bayan Mandahu Formation. It was found lying atop a nest composed by approximately 6 eggs as preserved, and these were laid in a mound-shaped structure with a circular pattern. As the specimen was found over the nest with its forelimbs covering the eggs and the partially preserved hindfoot near the center of the nest, Dong and Currie suggested that it was caught and buried by a sandstorm during incubation. They ruled out the possibility of oviraptorids being egg-thieves as they would have either consumed or instinctively abandoned the nest long before it was buried by a sandstorm or another meteorological phenomenon.

In 1999 Clark and team described in detail the previously reported &quot;Citipati&quot; nesting specimen and briefly discussed the holotype specimen of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; and its association with the nest AMNH 6508. They pointed out that the exact position in which the holotype was found over the nest is unclear as they were separated during preparation, and the nest appears to be not entirely complete with about 15 eggs preserved of which two damaged. Moreover, the semicircular arrangement of the nest indicates that the eggs were laid in pairs and in at least three rings, and this nest was originally circular, similar to a mound.

Thomas P. Hopp and Mark J. Orsen in 2004 analyzed the brooding behavior of extinct and extant dinosaur species, including oviraptorids, in order to evaluate the reason for the elongation and development of wing and tail feathers. Given that the most complete oviraptorid nesting specimen—at the time, the 1995 &quot;Citipati&quot; nesting specimen—was found in a very avian-like posture, with the forelimbs in a near-folded posture and the pectoral region, belly, and feet in contact with the eggs, Hopp and Orsen indicated that long pennaceous feathers and a feather covering were most likely present in life. The &quot;wings&quot; and tail of oviraptorids would have granted protection for the eggs and hatchlings against climate factors like the sunlight, wind, and rainfalls. However, the arms of this specimen were not extremely folded as in some modern birds, instead, they are more extended resembling the style of large flightless birds like the ostrich. The extended position of the arm is also similar to the brooding behavior of this bird, which is known to nest in large clutches like oviraptorids. Based on the forelimb position of nesting oviraptorids, Hopp and Orsen proposed brooding as the ancestral reason behind wing and tail feather elongation, as there was a greater need to provide optimal protection for eggs and juveniles.

In 2005, Tamaki Sato and team reported an unusual oviraptorid specimen from the Nanxiong Formation. This new specimen was found preserving mainly the pelvic region with two eggs inside and thereby indicating a female. The size and position of the eggs suggest that oviraptorids retained two functional oviducts, but had reduced the number of eggs ovulated to one per oviduct. David J. Varricchio and colleagues in 2008 found that the relatively large egg clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern birds that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care, such as ratite birds, suggesting similar habits. This reproductive system is most likely to represent the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. In 2014, W. Scott Persons and colleagues suggested that oviraptorosaurs were secondarily flightless and several of the traits in their tails may indicate a propensity for display behaviour, such as courtship display. The tail of several oviraptorosaurs and oviraptorids ended in pygostyles, a bony structure at the end of the tail that, at least in modern birds, is used to support a feather fan. Furthermore, the tail was notably muscular and had a pronounced flexibility, which may have aided in courtship movements.

In 2018, Tzu-Ruei Yang and colleagues identified cuticle layers on several egg-shells of maniraptoran dinosaurs including those of oviraptorids. These particular layers are composed of proteins, polysaccharides and pigments, but mainly of lipids and hydroxyapatite. In modern birds they serve to protect the eggs from dehydration and invasion of microorganisms. As most oviraptorid specimens have been found in formations of caliche-based sedimentation, Yang and colleagues suggested that the cuticle-coated eggs would have been a reproductive strategy adapted for enhancing their hatching success in such arid climates and environments.

In 2019 Yang and colleagues re-evaluated the hypothesis of thermoregulatory contact incubation using complete oviraptorid nests from the Nanxiong Formation, and provided a detailed reconstruction of the architecture of the oviraptorid clutch. They noted that adult oviraptorid specimens in association with nest were not necessarily incubating the eggs as they could represent a female in the process of laying eggs, and the multi-ring clutch prevented sufficient heat transfer from the parent to the inner rings of eggs. An average oviraptorid nest was built as a gently-inclined mound with a highly organized architecture: the eggs were likely pigmented and arranged in pairs with each pair arranged in three to four elliptical rings. As the parent was likely operating from the nest center, this region was devoid of eggs. Yang and colleagues concluded the oviraptorid nesting style was so unique that they lack modern analogs, therefore, using oviraptorid reproduction may not be the best example to inform about the evolution of bird reproductive strategies. However, the team was unable to determinate if the juvenile &quot;Oviraptor&quot; AMNH 33092 had hatched from the nest associated with the holotype.

==Paleoenvironment==

&quot;Oviraptor&quot; is known from the Bayn Dzak locality of the Djadokhta Formation in Mongolia, a formation that dates back to the Late Cretaceous about 71 million to 75 million years ago. The paleoenvironment of the Djadokhta Formation is interpreted as having a semiarid climate, with sand dune and alluvial settings similar to the modern Gobi Desert. The semiarid steppe landscape was drained by intermittent streams and was sometimes affected by dust and sandstorms, and moisture was seasonal. Though this formation is largely considered to preserved highly arid environments, several short-lived water bodies have been reported from the Ukhaa Tolgod locality, based on fluvial sedimentation. Furthermore, it is thought that later in the Campanian age and into the Maastrichtian, the climate would shift to the more humid fluvial environment seen in the Nemegt Formation.

The Djadokhta Formation is separated into a lower Bayn Dzak Member and an upper Turgrugyin Member. The known remains of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; have been produced by the Bayn Dzak member, which has also yielded the dinosaurs &quot;Bainoceratops&quot;, &quot;Pinacosaurus&quot;, &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, &quot;Saurornithoides&quot;, &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, and &quot;Halszkaraptor&quot;. Further dinosaur fauna from this member includes that of the Ukhaa Tolgod locality, composed of &quot;Apsaravis&quot;, &quot;Byronosaurus&quot;, &quot;Citipati&quot;, &quot;Gobipteryx&quot;, &quot;Khaan&quot;, &quot;Khol&quot;, &quot;Shuuvuia&quot;, &quot;Tsaagan&quot;, and &quot;Minotaurasaurus&quot;.

===Taphonomy===
The pose of the holotype of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; along with the association of eggs, suggest that it was trapped over the nest during a sandstorm, and burial was relatively rapid given that the body had no opportunity to become fully disarticulated or scavenged by predators. The paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter also agreed in that sandstorms may have been the most likely event that the eggs found in the deposits were buried. Among elements, the skull have become particularly flattened and distorted during the fossilization process.

<text>Dropline GNOME is a version of the GNOME desktop environment intended for use in Slackware. As Slackware has not included GNOME since 2005, Dropline GNOME is an option for Slackware users who wish to use GNOME as their desktops.

Dropline GNOME 3.20 was released on December 31, 2017.

== History ==
Due to developer constraints, the version of GNOME included with Slackware was inferior to that of many other distributions, and was later dropped entirely from the distribution. Dropline GNOME was created to account for the shortcomings and to fill the void left by this decision.

Todd Kulesza, dropline GNOME&#x27;s founder, has retired from further work on it. Dropline GNOME is now being maintained by a small group of volunteers from around the world who build different parts of the system.

== Release cycle ==
Each minor (second version number) release of GNOME results in a new installer application and package group being released. However, subsequent micro (third version number, e.g. from 2.16.1 to 2.16.2) releases of GNOME are typically distributed in the form of individual package updates as source packages are updated, and do not require replacement of the installer package. To ensure that users do not easily fall behind in package updates, Dropline GNOME includes a panel applet to notify users when new packages for their installed release are available for download.

== Criticism ==
Dropline GNOME has been criticized by some, including Slackware creator Patrick Volkerding, for adding PAM to the system, and for replacing large system files, including the whole X11 system. However, the Dropline GNOME team has discontinued rebuilding X11 as of version 2.16.1. They use the official Slackware packages whenever possible, and publish a list of conflicting packages for each targeted Slackware system/release.

Cases such as the PAM addition are not done without merit, however, as pam_console is an essential component in providing functional automount support via HAL, the GNOME Volume Manager, and other software.

<doc id="581473" wikidata="Q116367" url="?curid=581473" title="Frederick Haldimand">
<text>Sir Frederick Haldimand, KB (born François Louis Frédéric Haldimand; 11 August 1718 – 5 June 1791) was a Swiss military officer best known for his service in the British Army in North America during the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American Revolutionary War. From 1778 to 1786, he served as Governor of the Province of Quebec, during which time he oversaw military operations against the northern frontiers in the war, and engaged in ultimately fruitless negotiations to establish the independent Vermont Republic as a new British province. His administration of Quebec was at times harsh, with the detention of numerous political dissidents and agitators.

==Early life and career==
Haldimand was born in Yverdon, Vaud, Switzerland on 11 August 1718. He was the second of four sons of François Louis Haldimand, a notary and civil servant, and Marie-Madeleine de Treytorrens. His grandfather, Gaspard Haldimand, was a cooper who moved from Thun to Yverdon in 1671. Haldimand received only a limited education and became interested in the military at an early age.

In 1740, Haldimand joined the Prussian Army as a mercenary. During the War of the Austrian Succession he fought at the Battle of Mollwitz, and probably also saw action at Hohenfriedberg and Kesselsdorf. He next joined the Swiss Guards of the Dutch States Army in 1748, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1750. There he formed a friendship with Henry Bouquet, another Swiss mercenary, with whom he would serve in the British Army.

==French and Indian War==
In 1755, as the Seven Years&#x27; War, whose North American theater is also known as the French and Indian War, was in its early stages, Haldimand and Bouquet joined a British regiment composed of German and Swiss men recruited at first from the armies of Europe, but then also from German-speaking settlers in North America. The formation of the regiment, known as the Royal American, took two years and was beset by culture clashes with the rest of the British Army. However, Haldimand and Bouquet earned the respect of the British military establishment with their dedicated professionalism.

While Haldimand&#x27;s battalion was sent to Louisbourg in 1758, Haldimand himself served under General James Abercrombie at the disastrous Battle of Carillon at which he suffered minor wounds. 

After spending the winter in command of the forward British position at Fort Edward, he was made second in command on the 1759 expedition of John Prideaux against Fort Niagara and was placed in charge of the key supply and communication point at Oswego, New York, where he oversaw the construction of Fort Ontario.

When Prideaux was killed early during the Battle of Fort Niagara, Haldimand went to assume command of the operation, but William Johnson, the Indian agent on the expedition who took over, refused to relinquish control. Haldimand returned to Oswego, where he remained throughout the winter. 

In 1760, he joined General Jeffery Amherst&#x27;s army as it descended the Saint Lawrence River, and was the officer who formally took control of Montreal on September 8 following the French surrender. He was given the responsibility for working with the outgoing French leadership as they prepared to depart for France, serving first under Amherst and then under General Thomas Gage.

In 1762, Amherst promoted him to colonel and temporarily gave him the military governorship of Trois-Rivières while its governor, Ralph Burton, was called to serve in the Caribbean. At Trois-Rivières, he oversaw the development of the ironworks at nearby Saint Maurice and arranged for his nephew Peter Frederick Haldimand to serve under James Murray, the military governor of Quebec City.

==Pre-American Revolution years==
In 1764, the province of Quebec was turned over to a civil administration, and Haldimand&#x27;s role was reduced to that of a troop commander. Denied leave to return to Europe, he remained in Quebec until 1765, when his command was merged into another. He traveled to New York with the intention of returning to Europe, but the death of his friend Bouquet led to his promotion to brigadier general and assignment to Bouquet&#x27;s post as military head of the Southern Department, with responsibility for military affairs in East and West Florida. He remained in this post, which he characterized as &quot;the most disagreeable&quot; of his life, until 1773. Despite good relations with the civil governors, he had ongoing problems with supply and funding, and the high cost of living there put him into debt. He was promoted to colonel commandant of the Royal American in 1772, and received a pro forma promotion to major general later that year.

==American Revolution and American Revolutionary War==
General Gage called Haldimand to New York in 1773 to temporarily act as commander-in-chief of North America while he went to England on leave. While Haldimand&#x27;s command was uneventful, the political climate in the provinces noticeably declined, and he carefully resisted bringing troops in conflict with the population by refusing to get involved in the jurisdictional disputes over the New Hampshire Grants and refusing to protect tea shipments after the Boston Tea Party unless specifically requested to do so.

When Gage returned to Boston in 1774, Haldimand remained in command of the troops in New York, which Gage ordered to Boston in September 1774 in the wake of the colonial uprising known as the Powder Alarm. While Gage was primarily occupied with his duties as Governor of Massachusetts, Haldimand commanded the army in Boston although Gage did not notify him of the expedition that led to the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. With the arrival additional military leadership in Boston after that event, Haldimand was advised that his status as a foreigner made it inappropriate for him to exercise command in what was viewed as an internal civil conflict. He sailed from Boston in June 1775 (one day before the Battle of Bunker Hill), and arrived in London in August.

===Governor of Province of Quebec===

Haldimand became Governor of the Province of Quebec (which at the time included what is now Ontario) in 1778, and served through the American Revolution. Haldimand built up Quebec&#x27;s defenses in reaction to repeated rumors of American plans to again invade the province and limited offensive actions to raiding parties such as the 1778 raid by Christopher Carleton and the 1780 &quot;Burning of the Valleys&quot; into the rebellious American colonies. As an administrator, he at times dealt harshly with political activists by arresting Fleury Mesplet and Valentin Jautard, publishers of a literary journal that often featured political commentary, and Pierre du Calvet, an agitator for judicial reforms.

In 1781, Haldimand&#x27;s efforts on behalf of the British cause included engaging in negotiations with political representatives of the Vermont Republic, which had declared its independence from the state of New York in 1777 after long-standing disputes over jurisdiction. These negotiations, which are sometimes called the Haldimand Affair because of his participation, involved brothers Ira and Ethan Allen, and were promoted to see if Vermont could be convinced to become a new British province, which would then provide a new avenue for attack against the southern portions of New York and New England. The negotiations had reached the point that Haldimand believed Vermont was almost ready to admit British troops when news of the surrender at Yorktown arrived.

As the revolution came to an end by the Treaty of Paris (1783), Haldimand helped settle American Loyalist refugees, who became known as United Empire Loyalists, many in territories that are now in New Brunswick and Ontario.

He and Sir John Johnson, his Superintendent of Indian Affairs, also helped settle the Iroquois who had been driven out of New York during the war by issuing what is now known as the Haldimand Proclamation, which awarded them a tract of land on the Grand River in what is now known as Ontario&#x27;s Six Nations reserve.

==Later life==
In the summer of 1784, Frederick Haldimand returned to England, on leave, but he was not to return to Quebec, as he was formally replaced by General Carleton in 1786. In 1785, he was awarded the Order of the Bath. He settled in London, but made regular visits to his hometown of Yverdon, where he died, on 5 June 1791, while on one of his visits. 

Haldimand never married, and in his will he left all his property to his nephew Anthony Francis Haldimand, father of future MP and director of the Bank of England William Haldimand.

==Legacy==
Haldimand created and preserved a great deal of written correspondence, especially during his time in North America. As his military and administrative assignments ranged from Pensacola to Quebec and covered the years 1755 to 1784, this correspondence, much of it deposited in the Haldimand Collection at the British Museum (with copies at the Library and Archives Canada), provides a unique view into the colonial history leading to United States independence.

Haldimand has been memorialized with several place names in North America:
* in Canada:
** Haldimand County, Ontario; and Fort Haldimand at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, the latter named after him in 1949.
** Haldimand River in Prince Edward Island
** Haldimand Beach (&quot;Plage Haldimand&quot; in French), Cape Haldimand (&quot;Cap Haldimand&quot;) and the unincorporated places of Haldimand East and Haldimand West, all four near the town of Gaspé, Quebec;
** Haldimand Cliff (&quot;Falaise Haldimand&quot;) on Brion Island in the Magdalen Islands archipelago in Quebec
* in the United States:
** Haldimand Bay is the main harbor all boats enter to land at Mackinac Island, Michigan.

<doc id="581481" wikidata="Q4115494" url="?curid=581481" title="Volcanism of Italy">
<text>The volcanism of Italy is due chiefly to the presence, a short distance to the south, of the boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate. Italy is a volcanically active country, containing the only active volcanoes in mainland Europe (while volcanic islands are also present in Greece, in the volcanic arc of the southern Aegean). The lava erupted by Italy&#x27;s volcanoes is thought to result from the subduction and melting of one plate below another. 

Three main clusters of volcanism exist: a line of volcanic centres running northwest along the central part of the Italian mainland (see: Campanian volcanic arc); a cluster northeast of Sicily in the Aeolian Islands; and a cluster southwest of Sicily around the island of Pantelleria, in the Mediterranean&#x27;s Strait of Sicily. Sardinia has had a totally separate geological history from that of the rest of Italy, where several cycles of volcanic activity occurred, the last of which ended at the beginning of the Pleistocene, but currently hosts only permanently extinct volcanoes.

Due to their position within densely populated areas, Etna and Vesuvius have been included in the list of &quot;Volcanoes of the Decade&quot;, a global list of volcanoes to be kept under closer surveillance. In particular, the &quot;Volcanoes of the Decade&quot; is a list drawn up by International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth&#x27;s Interior, as part of a United Nations project, which includes, overall, 16 volcanoes distributed all over the world.

Italy was the first country to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity. The high geothermal gradient that forms part of the peninsula makes it potentially exploitable also in other regions; research carried out in the 1960s and 1970s identified potential geothermal fields in Lazio and Tuscany, as well as in most volcanic islands.

==Volcanoes==

===Active volcanoes===
Four of Italy&#x27;s volcanoes have erupted in the last one-hundred and fifty years:

* Mount Etna, on Sicily (continuous activity). It is the highest volcano in Europe west of the Caucasus. It last erupted in August 2024.
* Stromboli, one of the Aeolian Islands (continuous activity). 
* Mount Vesuvius, near Naples (last erupted in 1944); the only volcano to have recently erupted in Continental Europe.
* Vulcano, another of the Aeolian Islands, last erupted in 1888–1890.

===Dormant volcanoes===

At least 10 other volcanic centres have seen eruptions in historic times. In order of the most recent eruptions, they are:
* Pantelleria, off the coast of Tunisia, probably last erupted around 1,000 BC. There was a submarine eruption a few kilometres north-east of the island in 1891, which was probably related to the main volcano.
* Vulcanello, a small volcano connected by an isthmus to the island of Vulcano, which erupted out of the sea in 183 BC and showed occasional activity thereafter until the 16th century.
* Phlegraean Fields, a huge caldera containing the western area of Naples, erupted in 1538, generating the small tuff cone named Monte Nuovo (&quot;new mountain&quot;).
* Ischia, an island 20 kilometres west of Naples, last erupted in 1302.
* Lipari, an island a couple of kilometres from Vulcano, has a volcano which last erupted in 1230.
* Monte Albano, a quiescent volcanic complex near Rome (south). The most recent eruptions produced Lake Nemi and Lake Albano. It may have last erupted in 5,000 BC, the idea of eruptions during the Holocene have since been questioned, and the last ascertained eruption occurred in 34,000 BC. Since this time interval is comparable to the average dormancy time of the volcano, it cannot yet be considered extinct.
* Sabatini, (Bracciano volcano and Sacrofano volcano) is a volcanic complex and caldera near Rome (north). It last erupted in 70,000 BC, but, as for the Monte Albano, it cannot yet be considered extinct.
* Cimini (Cimino volcano and Vico volcano), a volcanic complex and caldera at the north of the Sabatini volcanic complex. It last erupted in 90,000 BC.
* Panarea, part of the Aeolian Islands, last erupted in the Pleistocene, but a high seismic and gaseous activity suggests that it can be considered quiescent.

=== Underwater volcanoes ===

In addition to the volcanoes on land, there are three submarine volcanoes in the seas surrounding Italy, in particular in the south-eastern Tyrrhenian and in the Strait of Sicily:
* Marsili, a submarine volcano in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Marsili rises 3,000 metres from the seabed in the Tyrrhenian sea 180 km south of Naples. Its summit is only 500 metres below the surface of the water. The volcano last erupted between 2,100 and 5,000 BC, and is considered active, and potentially dangerous, as a possible collapse of the volcanic building could trigger a tsunami. However, it is not yet clear how much this eventuality is actually possible, as there is no evidence of similar collapses (and consequent tsunamis) in the last 700,000 years.
* Isola Ferdinandea, emerged following a surtseyan eruption, a few kilometers north-west of Pantelleria in 1831, reaching a maximum height of 63 meters, but was eroded again at sea level after a few months. The summit is now a few meters below the surface of the sea. A later eruption may have occurred in 1863, but this is not proven. A swarm of small earthquakes in 2002 led to think that magma was moving under the volcano, but no eruption occurred. It is located in the so-called Graham volcanic field, which is believed to be, together with the nearby Terribile and Nerita fields, part of a hypothetical large underwater volcano called Empedocles. However, this hypothesis is not definitively confirmed.
* Palinuro, an underwater volcano in the Tyrrhenian Sea near the Cilento coast. It last erupted around 8,000 BC, and like the Marsili it is considered active and potentially dangerous.

===Main extinct volcanoes===

In Italy there is also a large number of geological structures due to extinct volcanic centres. It is possible to group these volcanoes into various categories:

* Many smaller islands belonging to the Italian Republic are of volcanic origin; the remaining Aeolian Islands (Alicudi, Filicudi, Salina) and Phlegraean Islands (Vivara and Procida), the Cyclopean Isles, Ustica, Linosa, the Pontine Islands and Capraia.
* Vulsini (Bolsena volcano, Latera volcano, Montefiascone volcano), a caldera complex at the northern end of the Roman magmatic province (at the north of Cimini volcanic complex).
* Lazio anti-Apennines; this area was particularly rich in volcanic activity up to the Upper Pleistocene, leaving behind a large number of volcanoes with a characteristic more or less circular shape (due to the collapse of the magma chamber): Lake Bolsena, Lake Bracciano, Lake Albano, Lake Nemi, Lake Vico. The corresponding volcanic systems are those of the Alban Hills, Monti Sabatini, Monti Cimini, Monti Volsini, and Monti della Tolfa. The first two considered dormant, the others (despite an alleged eruption of the Volsini in 104 BC) are instead considered definitively extinct.
* Still in the anti-Apennines, to the south, are the Roccamonfina (in Campania), Vulture, and the flat-topped Cervati, with Roccamonfina and Vulture both dating back to the Pleistocene and Cervati to an unknown date.
* The landform that the village of Civita di Bagnoregio sits on is an unstable volcanic plateau made of tuff. It has been falling apart due to instability and the Tiber River.
* To the north, in Tuscany, the Monte Amiata last erupted about 130,000 BC, and which still has a remarkable geothermal activity.
* Much older (dating back to the Oligocene) are the Euganean Hills in Veneto. However, geothermal activity is found here.
* In Valsesia (Piedmont) the remains of an ancient supervolcano were found, dating back to about 290 million years ago, long before the formation of the Alps.
* Among the volcanoes of Sardinia the main ones are Monte Arci (whose obsidian was extracted and exported in prehistoric times), Montiferru, Mount Arcuentu and the plateaus of the Giare, of a basaltic nature. These are volcanoes dating back to the period between the end of the Pliocene and the first part of the Pleistocene.
* In the Tyrrhenian Sea there are also numerous submarine volcanoes that are now considered extinct: the Vasilov, the Lametini, the Magnaghi, as well as numerous other underwater mountains whose volcanic nature has only recently been discovered.

==Significant eruptions==
===Vesuvius===

The volcanic system of Somma-Vesuvius is generally characterized by explosive eruptions. The most widely-known is the one that destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae and Oplontis in 79 AD, causing thousands of victims. It is estimated that this eruption had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) equal to 5, and is considered the archetype of Plinian eruptions, which are named after Pliny the Younger, an eyewitness of the event.

Scholars have discovered that previously Vesuvius had given rise to even more violent Plinian eruptions, the last of which was that of the pumice of Avellino about 3,900 BP (estimated to have a VEI of 6). After 79 AD there were no more plinian eruptions, but at most sub-plinian. The most important were that of 472 AD (whose ash reached Constantinople) and that of 1631, which killed thousands of people (due to pyroclastic flows and lahars),) and which was taken as a reference by Protezione Civile for the drafting of evacuation plans in the event of future eruptions. Due to this eruptive history, and the very high population density in the Metropolitan City of Naples, Vesuvius is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world.

===Phlegraean Fields===

Unlike Vesuvius, the nearby Phlegraean Fields are not made up of a single large volcanic edifice, but are a vast volcanic field within which numerous eruptive vents have opened, often different from eruptions. The only eruption in historical times, which generated Monte Nuovo and Lake Avernus, was of low intensity, and was preceded by a period of quiescence that lasted more than 3,000 years (before which there was a long sequence of close eruptions). However, the Phlegraean Fields are capable of producing violent eruptions, which earned them the title of supervolcano.

The most famous was that of the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption, which occurred about 40,000 BP, considered the most severe ever to occur in the Mediterranean area, having a VEI equal to 7, and which probably had effects on the climate worldwide. Only slightly less intense was that of the Neapolitan yellow tuff, which occurred about 15,000 BP. There are also indications of a third large-magnitude eruption, which probably occurred 29,000 BP. For this reason, the Phlegraean Fields are also closely monitored by the Vesuvius Observatory.

They are also characterized by numerous secondary volcanic phenomena, of which the best known is the Phlegraean bradyseism, which in the second half of the 1900s led to the evacuation of entire districts of the city of Pozzuoli.

===Etna===

Etna is characterized by an almost continuous eruptive activity, and, unlike Vesuvius, the eruptions of Etna tend to be effusive, with lava flows that can come from both the summit craters and side openings. These eruptions almost always do not cause high damage, but there are exceptions. The largest effusive eruption of Etna in historical times took place in 1669, when the lava buried numerous villages reaching the sea near Catania, with a flow up to 17 km long. This eruption completely changed the landscape of the area, but due to its effusive nature there were no victims associated with the eruption.

Another eruption of similar magnitude occurred in 396 BC, when the lava flows, reaching the sea, hindered the advance of the Carthaginian army of Himilco during the Greco-Punic wars (as described by Diodorus Siculus). A few dozen deaths were recorded in Bronte in the eruption of 1843, due to a phreatic explosion due to contact between the lava and a source of water. The last highly destructive eruption occurred in 1928, when the lava buried the town of Mascali. In the 1979 eruption, a sudden explosion caused nine deaths and 23 injuries in a group of tourists on excursion, and in that same eruption the last official order to evacuate an inhabited centre was issued due to an eruption of Etna.

The great explosive eruption of 122 BC, a Plinian event, which caused serious damage to the Roman city of Catania, which for this reason was exempt from paying taxes to Rome for a decade, was completely different. A further explosive eruption, of a sub-Plinian type, occurred in 44 BC. This eruptive history, associated with the high population density of the Metropolitan City of Catania (but with a less problematic situation than that of Naples), therefore requires continuous surveillance of the volcano.

===Stromboli===

Stromboli is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, with almost persistent activity for at least 2,000 years, which is why it was nicknamed the &quot;lighthouse of the Mediterranean&quot;. Usually this activity consists of a continuous degassing, interspersed with small bursts of low intensity, at temporal distances that can vary from a few minutes to a few hours, a type of eruption that is defined precisely as Strombolian.

About 1–2 times per decade, lava can overflow from the summit craters, forming flows that can also reach the sea. These flows usually go towards the north-western area of the island, in the so-called Sciara del Fuoco (a depression shaped like a horseshoe, formed about 6,000 BP,) away from the inhabited settlements. At irregular intervals, Stromboli can give rise to much more violent explosions than normal, called paroxysms, which can instead cause damage to the population.

On 11 September 1930, what is considered the most violent eruptive event of the volcano in the last 13 centuries, occurred with a massive fallout of volcanic material on the inhabited centre of Ginostra and the formation of a pyroclastic flow outside the Sciara del Fuoco. In total, there were four deaths and numerous buildings destroyed. The most recent paroxysmal events occurred on 3 July and 28 August 2019, with the former explosion causing the death of a hiker. In these eruptions, pyroclastic flows able to flow over the sea for a few hundred meters have also been observed.

A further source of danger about Stromboli is the risk of landslides (often in correspondence with the paroxysms), both aerial and submarine, capable of causing tsunami waves. The last event of this type occurred on 30 December 2002, when the wave did damage to coastal buildings. An underwater landslide event of greater proportions could have caused the tsunami in the Gulf of Naples in 1343.

<text>Knots Landing is an American primetime television soap opera that aired on CBS from December 27, 1979, to May 13, 1993. A spin-off of &quot;Dallas&quot;, it was set in a fictitious coastal suburb of Los Angeles and initially centered on the lives of four married couples living on a cul-de-sac, Seaview Circle. Throughout its 14-year run, storylines included marital strife, rape, murder, kidnapping, assassinations, drug smuggling, politics, addictions, environmental issues, corporate intrigue, and criminal investigations. By the time of its conclusion, it had become the third-longest-running primetime drama on American television after &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Bonanza&quot; and the last scripted primetime drama show that debuted in the 1970s to leave the air.

&quot;Knots Landing&quot; was created by David Jacobs (one-time writer of &quot;Family&quot; and later producer of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;) in conjunction with producer Michael Filerman (who would also later co-produce &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;). Although a spin-off of &quot;Dallas&quot;, the concept predates that series, and was rebuffed by CBS in 1977, as the network wanted something more &quot;saga-like&quot;. Jacobs then created &quot;Dallas&quot;, which the network accepted and premiered in 1978. After &quot;Dallas&quot; became a hit, Jacobs was then able to adapt &quot;Knots Landing&quot; as a spin-off series by way of incorporating the characters of Gary and Valene Ewing who were first introduced in &quot;Dallas&quot;. The series was largely inspired by a 1957 movie &quot;No Down Payment&quot; and also by the 1973 Ingmar Bergman television miniseries &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;.

Though initially not as popular in the ratings as &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; ultimately outlasted it and garnered much critical acclaim. There were 344 episodes spanning 14 seasons of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; from 1979 to 1993. In 1997, much of the cast reunited for a two-part miniseries titled &quot;Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac&quot;. In 2005, they reunited again for the non-fiction special &quot;Knots Landing Reunion: Together Again&quot; in which the cast reminisced about their time on the show. &quot;Dallas&quot; itself was revived in 2012, with Gary and Valene Ewing appearing in its second season. During nearly the entire run of the original series, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; occupied the same timeslot: Thursday nights at 10:00 p.m. For a while, it was moved to the 9:00 p.m. timeslot when &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; was moved to Thursday nights for the final four episodes of its run. When &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; ended its run, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; was moved back to its 10:00 p.m. timeslot and stayed there until it ended &quot;its&quot; run. On two other occasions, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; was also moved to Thursdays at 9:00 p.m. to make room for two short-lived dramas, &quot;Jessica Novak&quot; and &quot;Kay O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

==Backstory==
Gary Ewing (Ted Shackelford) was the middle son and black sheep of the Ewing family from &quot;Dallas&quot;. His father Jock (Jim Davis) and elder brother J. R. (Larry Hagman) had never treated him as an equal, and viewed him as a weak link. At 17, Gary ran away from home and met 15-year-old waitress Valene Clements (Joan Van Ark) and quickly married her, producing a daughter, Lucy (Charlene Tilton). The family arrived to Southfork Ranch, the Ewing homestead, and found that Gary had risen in his family&#x27;s estimations: Jock liked Valene and was proud to be a grandfather, and Gary&#x27;s mother Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes) was thrilled to have him home. At his parents&#x27; insistence, J. R. started including him in dealings at Ewing Oil, but J. R. landed him with failing business deals and made it appear that Gary was at fault. These pressures forced Gary into alcoholism and, unable to cope with disappointing his family, he fled Southfork, leaving Valene and Lucy behind. Without Gary in his way, J. R. persecuted Valene until she left the ranch, and Texas, with infant Lucy. She headed to Tennessee to find her mother, Lilimae Clements (Julie Harris), but Lilimae turned her away. Shortly afterward J. R. found her, taking Lucy back to Southfork to be raised by &quot;true Ewings&quot; and threatening Valene with a warning against returning to Texas.

Years later, youngest Ewing brother Bobby (Patrick Duffy) and his wife Pamela (Victoria Principal) found Gary working as a waiter in Las Vegas, and they convinced him to return home and visit Miss Ellie. At the same time, Lucy discovered that Valene had returned to Dallas and was working as a waitress in a diner, and began meeting with her in secret to avoid J. R.&#x27;s wrath. Lucy then engineered a meeting between her parents, which led to them reconciling and moving into Southfork together. J. R., upset and jealous that his parents were now lauding Gary&#x27;s new start, saddled him with a failing company, the pressures of which led to him choosing to leave Southfork before he relapsed into drinking again. J. R. then forced Valene off the ranch again without letting her say goodbye to Lucy; instead, J. R. made out that Valene had abandoned her again, and taken a $5000 payoff from him. During these episodes on &quot;Dallas&quot; the part of Gary Ewing was originally portrayed by David Ackroyd.

A year later, Valene appeared at Lucy&#x27;s college hoping for a reconciliation. Still thinking Valene had run out on her, Lucy rebuffed her. However, with help from Bobby, Lucy and Valene reconciled again and they maintained their relationship. Shortly afterwards, Valene revealed to Miss Ellie that she and Gary were still writing to each other. Gary returned to Dallas and mended his relationship with Jock, before marrying Valene for a second time. After they announced that they were planning to move to California, Miss Ellie bought them a new-build house as a wedding present.

&quot;Knots Landing&quot; is officially spun off from &quot;Dallas&quot; in the third-season episode &quot;Return Engagements&quot;.

In the meantime, Laura starts an affair with her boss, Scooter Warren (Allan Miller), and Abby soon dumps Richard when her ex-husband, Jeff (Barry Jenner), threatens to take her children from her. While separated from Kenny, Ginger starts a romance with the father of one of her students, although she and Kenny eventually reconcile. Near the end of the season, Jeff succeeds in taking Olivia and Brian from Abby, leaving her frantic. When Sid discovered some car parts that Gary and Abby had purchased were actually stolen, his brakes were tampered with to keep him from testifying in court. As a result, in the season finale, Sid&#x27;s car plunges off a cliff.

He then inherits millions of dollars from his recently deceased father, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis). Investing money in several ways, Gary takes an interest in a beautiful younger singer named Ciji Dunne (Lisa Hartman). Valene releases her book, titled &quot;Capricorn Crude&quot;, a thinly veiled exposé of the Ewings of Dallas. With the charges dropped against Sid Fairgate&#x27;s killers, Karen seeks the help of federal prosecutor Mack MacKenzie (Kevin Dobson), whom she starts dating and eventually marries mid-season. Valene&#x27;s publicist, Chip Roberts (Michael Sabatino), moves in with Valene and Lilimae, and trouble starts when he dates Diana and Ciji at the same time, later getting Ciji pregnant. Ciji insists on keeping the baby, much to Chip&#x27;s annoyance and anger. Ciji also became close to Laura which angered Richard, and was also romantically linked to Gary.

The season ends with Gary sitting in jail, awaiting trial for Ciji&#x27;s murder.

===Season 5 (1983–84)===
Gary is cleared of Ciji&#x27;s murder, and the police hunt for Chip who is now their prime suspect. He is eventually arrested but not before he and Diana are married, which strains her relationship with Karen who becomes so stressed that she becomes addicted to prescription painkillers. Meanwhile, Sid and Abby&#x27;s uncle dies, leaving Abby and (by default) Karen a land inheritance at Lotus Point, California. Without Karen&#x27;s knowledge, Abby schemes to build a resort on the land while cutting Karen out of her plans. Abby then forms a company called Apolune, a secret subsidiary of Gary&#x27;s corporation, and she convinces Gary to marry her so she can share the inheritance he got from his father. Valene begins a relationship with journalist Ben Gibson (Douglas Sheehan), but after a one-night stand with Gary, she learns she is pregnant with twins. Valene decides not to tell Gary that he is the father, as he is now married to Abby, and as she had fallen in love with Ben. However, Ben could not accept that Valene was pregnant with another man&#x27;s children and he and Valene break up. Abby hires a Ciji look-alike, Cathy Geary (also played by Lisa Hartman), to keep Gary distracted so he would not learn about her crooked business dealings. Politician Greg Sumner (William Devane), an old college friend of Mack&#x27;s who was running for U.S. Senator, receives the endorsements of Mack and Karen, as well as Abby, who wanted to buy herself a senator. Greg hires Mack to lead his Senate Crime Commission investigating the sinister Wolfbridge Group. Abby convinces Greg to get her an illegal land variance to build on Lotus Point but, after pressure from Wolfbridge, Greg pins it on Mack in order to discredit his investigation, thus ending their friendship. While a fugitive from the police, Chip falls on a pitchfork and dies after seeing Cathy, thinking she was Ciji back from the dead. After Karen&#x27;s recovery from her drug addiction, she and Diana reconcile. Wolfbridge forces Abby into making them her partners in the Lotus Point development. Mack investigates the land ownership at Lotus Point and Laura confesses that Apolune is Abby&#x27;s company. Gary decides to divorce Abby as he cannot trust her. When Mack fakes Gary&#x27;s death to snare Wolfbridge, Karen leaves him, believing his obsession with Wolfbridge has cost them their marriage.

Meanwhile, Gary and Abby reconcile and, along with Karen, they agree to become partners in Lotus Point. Lilimae&#x27;s secret son and Valene&#x27;s half-brother, Joshua Rush (Alec Baldwin), whom Lilimae abandoned as an infant, arrives in Knots Landing and moves in with Lilimae and Valene. He soon starts a romance with Cathy, who has moved into the cul-de-sac with Laura and her children. Abby starts running a television station, World Pacific Cable, that Ben becomes a journalist for after Gary purchased it. Joshua also works at the station and later becomes a popular televangelist. Abby is stunned to learn that Gary is the father of Valene&#x27;s unborn twins, and Abby tells Scott Easton (Jack Bannon), an influential lobbyist with shady connections, about her problem. As a favor to Abby, Scott arranges to have Valene&#x27;s babies kidnapped at birth, though without Abby&#x27;s approval.

Gary befriends the aging millionaire Paul Galveston (Howard Duff), and Galveston offers Gary the opportunity to develop Empire Valley, a large piece of real estate. Galveston soon dies, and he leaves his millions to Greg, who is proven to have been his son. Assuming he had been left Empire Valley, Greg resigns from the Senate, but is shocked to learn that the land had been left to Gary. Greg&#x27;s devious mother, Ruth (guest star Ava Gardner), comes to visit her son after Galveston&#x27;s death. Ruth becomes close to Abby (since they have similar interests), but loathes Laura, who, by this time has started a relationship with Greg. Around this same time, Joshua and Cathy grow closer, and the two soon marry. Valene (still believing she is &quot;Verna&quot;) becomes engaged to a man in Tennessee, but Gary finally finds her and brings her back to Knots Landing, where she rekindles her romance with Ben, but still believes her babies to be alive. Karen and Ben discover that Valene&#x27;s doctor had paid off a nurse to assist in the kidnapping of Valene&#x27;s children. Mack tracks down Valene&#x27;s babies, who had been adopted illegally. Abby confides in Greg that she inadvertently caused the kidnapping of Valene&#x27;s babies, but she now wants to get them back. In the season finale, Abby goes to Valene and tells her that she knows where her babies are, and the two go to the home of Sheila and Harry Fisher (Robin Ginsburg and Joe Regalbuto). Sheila disbelieves their claims that the babies were adopted illegally and shouts to warn Harry who takes off with one of the twins in his car.

After a frantic battle to expose the illegal black market adoption, Valene&#x27;s children are returned to her, whom she names Betsy and Bobby.

Abby successfully covers her tracks in the matter by simply telling Gary that she had received a phone call for a &quot;Mrs. Ewing&quot; telling her where the babies could be found. Gary receives news of his brother Bobby&#x27;s death and returns to Dallas for the funeral (Bobby Ewing&#x27;s death was later explained as being a &quot;dream&quot; on &quot;Dallas&quot; at the start of its tenth season in 1986, though this was never acknowledged on &quot;Knots Landing&quot; as Bobby was never mentioned again). Empire Valley went awry when Gary learns that Galveston Industries and its partners were secretly building an underground espionage operation there. Gary subsequently blows Empire Valley up. Peter Hollister (Hunt Block) goes to work for Greg, and with the help of Sylvia Lean (guest star Ruth Roman) acting as his mother, Peter convinces Greg that he is also Paul Galveston&#x27;s son, therefore making he and Greg half brothers. Jill Bennett (Teri Austin), Peter&#x27;s sister, becomes Mack&#x27;s new colleague, although Jill and Peter keep their relationship a secret as an effort to get revenge on the Galveston family for having wronged their family years before. Abby soon discovers that Sylvia is not Peter&#x27;s mother and that Peter is not Galveston&#x27;s son, therefore blackmailing Peter into paying her to keep their secret safe. In the meantime, Joshua becomes increasingly controlling and abusive towards Cathy, and in a moment of rage he tries to kill her but falls of the roof of a building and dies. Cathy soon starts an affair with Ben, who becomes her manager for her budding singing career but she later leaves town. Abby discovers that her daughter Olivia has developed a drug problem.

With Mack&#x27;s help, Ben foils the plan, although Jean continues to threaten him and his family which prompts Ben to leave the country at the end of the season. Laura angrily blames Valene for not telling her about the plot to kill Greg. Laura also tells Greg that she is pregnant, but he is not enthusiastic about it, and she refuses to have an abortion. In the meantime, Paige reveals that she faked her death in order to escape the control of her wealthy grandparents, although Karen doubts the story, believing her to be an impostor. Also, Paige had developed a romantic relationship with Michael, Karen&#x27;s son, but she soon tires of him and starts romancing Peter. Abby&#x27;s daughter Olivia&#x27;s drug addiction has worsened, eventually leading to the injuring of Lilimae in a car accident, and Abby resorts to desperate measures to get her clean. When her drug dealer beats up her younger brother Brian, Olivia finally admits to her addiction and decides to get clean. Olivia then becomes friends with Peter, and develops a crush on him, although he is interested in Paige. Peter, having become state senator with Greg&#x27;s support, goes to the extreme to hide the fact that Jill is his sister, who has started a relationship with Gary. When Jill and Peter have an argument, Jill is injured in a fall from and Peter flees the scene to avoid any link to her or the accident. Paige&#x27;s mother, Anne Matheson (Michelle Phillips), whom Paige had said was dead, appears and tries to rekindle her love affair with Mack. When Mack refuses her advances, she turns her attention to Greg, who also turns her down, and she therefore leaves town. At the end of the season, Abby finds Olivia standing over Peter&#x27;s dead body. With both assuming the other had killed Peter, Abby frantically buries his body under the soil at Lotus Point where cement is to be poured the following day. Some weeks later, believing she had successfully hidden Peter&#x27;s body, Abby is informed by Karen that there is a crack in the cement foundations and that it has to be pulled up and redone.

Jill conceives an elaborate plan where she edits audio recordings of Ben&#x27;s voice to make Valene think he was trying to contact her. In an effort to make Valene appear unstable, Jill steals the tapes, leaving Valene with no proof of Ben trying to contact her. In the season finale, Jill goes to Valene&#x27;s home and, at gunpoint, she forces Valene to swallow sleeping pills, hoping it will appear that Valene has committed suicide. The following morning, Valene is found motionless on her bedroom floor.

Frank finds Valene unconscious and telephones for an ambulance. Valene survives and says that Jill had tried to kill her. While Jill has provided herself with an alibi, Valene&#x27;s testimony is later proven true.

Following a health and safety report, the Lotus Point land has to be sold. However, it was soon revealed that Abby had falsified the report after she discovered that there was oil underneath Lotus Point, and created a company to conceal who was buying the resort from her partners. Paige exposed that the whole thing had been initiated by Abby and her cohort Ted Melcher (Robert Desiderio), which infuriated Karen, who was determined to send Abby to jail for fraud. Abby narrowly avoided being imprisoned, and agreed to donate Lotus Point to city as a public park. Abby then leaves Greg and Knots Landing, accepting a Trade Envoy job in Japan (a job Greg himself wanted after losing the run for mayor).

However, Greg stops Abby by threatening to reveal her dirty dealings while she was in Japan. As Treadwell prepares to kill Nick, who was working for him, Treadwell himself was killed by Vanessa Hunt (Felicity Waterman). Anne offers to divorce Greg so he can resume his relationship with her daughter Paige, whom he loves. Claudia decides to leave Knots Landing for Monaco, and at the airport, she runs into Anne and Nick, who are also leaving town. In the final scenes, back at Seaview Circle, Karen, Mack, Valene, and Gary prepare a barbecue as a new couple begin moving into Frank Williams&#x27; old home. Meanwhile, Abby arrives at the gathering and reveals that she has just purchased her old house in Seaview Circle. Valene simply smiles and welcomes Abby back, before she and Gary go home. Realizing Gary and Valene are happily reunited, Abby looks at Karen and comments &quot;Just like old times, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;. In the final shot, Karen watches Abby go inside her new home, mildly concerned as to what effect her return will have on the cul-de-sac, before smiling contentedly.

===The death of Bobby Ewing===
On &quot;Dallas&quot;, the character of Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) was killed off in the final episode of the 1984–85 season. The following year, Duffy decided to return to &quot;Dallas&quot; and the character of Bobby was resurrected in the infamous &quot;shower scene&quot; at the end of the 1985–86 season. At the start of the 1986–87 season, it was revealed that Bobby&#x27;s death and all but the final scene of the 1985–86 season had been a dream of Bobby&#x27;s ex-wife, Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal).

On &quot;Knots Landing&quot; during the 1985–86 season, Bobby&#x27;s death had an indelible impact on some of the characters (i.e. Gary struggling to deal with his brother&#x27;s death and being comforted by his wife Abby, Abby and Greg then taking advantage of Gary&#x27;s absence to control development of Empire Valley, and Valene naming her baby son after the late Bobby). When Bobby&#x27;s death and the subsequent season were revealed to be a dream on &quot;Dallas&quot;, this did not get applied to the continuity of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; and Bobby&#x27;s return was simply never addressed or even mentioned afterwards. Following this, no further crossover storylines were featured on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;.

===&quot;Dallas&quot; (2012 TV series)===
With the 2012 continuation of &quot;Dallas&quot;, rumors began surfacing that both Joan Van Ark and Ted Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary Ewing on the new series. Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him during the first season, but accepted a multi-episode role during the second. Shackelford returned to &quot;Dallas&quot; for three episodes and Van Ark returned for one. This was the first time the characters had been seen since the 1997 miniseries &quot;Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac&quot;. Although both Shackelford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of &quot;Dallas&quot; playing &quot;alternative&quot; versions of Gary and Valene (the episode depicted an alternate reality in which J. R. Ewing had never been born), there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from &quot;Knots Landing&quot; to &quot;Dallas&quot; or vice versa since the 1985–86 season of each show (which, on &quot;Dallas&quot;, turned out to be a dream had by Pam Ewing). In the 2013 &quot;Dallas&quot; storyline, it is made clear that Gary and Val had still been living together at their home in California, though had recently separated due to Gary&#x27;s brief relapse into alcoholism due to financial worries. At the end of their appearances on the new series of &quot;Dallas&quot;, Gary and Val return to California together.

==Behind the scenes==
&quot;Knots Landing&quot; was created by David Jacobs, whose original concept was a show based on &quot;family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level&quot;. CBS initially turned down this idea, as they wanted something more &quot;glitzy&quot; to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become &quot;Dallas&quot;. Once that show became a success after the initial run as a five-episode miniseries, the producers decided to expand the roles of certain characters. They introduced Lucy Ewing&#x27;s (Charlene Tilton) parents, who had not been shown on-screen until that point, in the two-part episode &quot;The Reunion&quot;. After the success of &quot;Dallas&quot;, Jacobs presented his initial idea again and created &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: &quot; Well, that&#x27;s pretty good, but you know-and then he pulled out the pages that we&#x27;d left for them a few years ago on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, or a year before on &quot;Knots&quot;, and he said, &#x27;Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?&#x27; I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it.&quot;

Gary Ewing was originally played by David Ackroyd on &quot;Dallas&quot;, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Joan Van Ark continued to play Val Ewing for the spin-off. Initially, it was presumed that Tilton would also be joining &quot;Knots Landing&quot; (and have Lucy move in with her parents to the Seaview Circle cul-de-sac), but the network decided to keep her on &quot;Dallas&quot; in order to keep the two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first-season episode &quot;Home is for Healing&quot;.

The actors on &quot;Knots Landing&quot; had more input than actors on other 1980s primetime soaps. In 1987, the writers wanted Mack (Kevin Dobson) to have an extramarital affair with Anne (Michelle Phillips). Michele Lee, who played Mack&#x27;s wife Karen, protested this to Jacobs, saying, &quot;There has to be one stable couple on the show.&quot; The extramarital affair storyline was nixed, and Michelle Phillips, who had been signed to a contract, was written out for a couple of seasons before returning in 1990. When she did return, Anne did not pursue Mack. William Devane, who played Greg Sumner, re-wrote most of his character&#x27;s dialogue, to the point where, in co-star Michele Lee&#x27;s words, &quot;most people (on set) were (probably) frightened of him&quot;. The Gary/Val/Abby triangle that provided story throughout the mid-1980s was suggested by Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark in 1980, and the producers hesitated for a year and a half before going through with it in 1982. The famous 1984 storyline where Valene&#x27;s babies got kidnapped was originally envisioned as one of scheming Abby&#x27;s plots. Donna Mills, who played Abby, acknowledged that her character was evil but did not think she was &quot;that&quot; evil. Fearing the audience would never forgive her character for kidnapping another woman&#x27;s babies, she asked the writers to make the kidnappings a result of Abby&#x27;s actions, but only by accident, and the writers complied. Bruce Campbell, who appeared in a 1987 episode, would later marvel at &quot;the &quot;speed&quot; and clinical precision&quot; of the production as opposed to the low-budget films and television series he had acted in up until this point. In particular, he wrote that Michele Lee &quot;ran the set like a drill seargent and laid out all the blocking.&quot;

The writing team of Bernard Lechowick and Lynn Marie Latham (the head writers from 1986 to 1991) was controversial among both fans and actors. Their humor-imbued style of writing made them the favorites of Michele Lee, while John Pleshette felt they were &quot;awful people.&quot; Pleshette, however, was not a regular cast member during their tenure (only making a guest appearance in 1987), and harbored resentment because the writing team, who had been represented by his wife, moved to a different agency. Joan van Ark, whose character was struck by a brain illness in season 12 and proceeded to thereafter go crazy, felt that Latham and Lechowick had turned her character into the &quot;village idiot.&quot; Joan Van Ark&#x27;s and Donna Mills&#x27; favorite &quot;Knots Landing&quot; writer was Peter Dunne, who was responsible for making &quot;Knots Landing&quot; a top ten show in 1984.

In 1987, CBS demanded that production costs be cut. This meant the firing of two regulars, Constance McCashin and Julie Harris. Season 13 saw a large ratings drop for the show after writer/producers Bernard Lechowick and Lynn Marie Latham left to create &quot;Homefront&quot; and creator David Jacobs had a health crisis and pulled back his involvement in production. Jacobs has publicly stated that the way he knew the show was in trouble was when waitresses at his favorite diner, whom he had heard gossiping about &quot;Knots Landing&quot; every Friday during past seasons, suddenly stopped discussing the show in late 1991. He attempted to save face by shutting down production on November 20, 1991, firing head writer John Romano, and replacing him with Ann Marcus. Cost cutting again plagued the series in its final season, when only 19 episodes were produced, and (with the exception of Michele Lee) regular cast members did not appear in every episode. Not wanting to compromise what he felt had been a good run, series creator David Jacobs described its end as a &quot;mutual decision&quot; between &quot;Knots Landing&quot; producers and the CBS Network, saying, &quot;We don&#x27;t know if they would have picked us up anyway...but even if they had, we would have had to pare away more to survive.&quot;

The series&#x27; signature cul-de-sac, Seaview Circle, was actually Crystalaire Place in Granada Hills, California, a suburban street in Los Angeles&#x27; San Fernando Valley about 20 miles north of the Pacific Ocean. The opening credits during the first two seasons were edited in such a way to make it appear that the cul-de-sac was closer to the beach. The aerial shots as seen in the opening and end credits from 1981 to 1987, were filmed at Palos Verdes Estates, an affluent coastal area of Los Angeles.

==Music==
The theme song, which lasted all 14 seasons was composed by Jerrold Immel. Immel, along with Craig Huxley composed the background music for the pilot. The original background music cues by Immel and Huxley were never fully abandoned by the show, and were heard right through until the final season. The early Knots Landing background music cues heavily emphasized the brass section, and were often played with a very sparse bass line accompaniment. It was the only aspect of the series ever to win an Emmy award, for the music orchestration during its 1979–80 season.

By the debut of the fourth season in 1982 the lushness of the 1980s was in full swing and background cues were changed to reflect that style. The new dramatic cues emphasized full orchestral arrangements as formerly middle-class Knots Landing became upwardly mobile. The background music of seasons 4–7 was frequently composed by either Lance Rubin or Ron Grant.

Season 8 in 1986 introduced a completely new score for the show. New wave artists and bands had taken America by storm and the new style of music cues made good use of the synthesizer instead of a full orchestra. Bruce Miller was one of the main composers during this era. Updated orchestrations of the by-then familiar Lance Rubin cues were also re-arranged to be played by the synthesizer, and the Immel/Huxley cues were similarly utilized, albeit less commonly.

In the early 1990s, soft contemporary acoustic music became popular and &quot;Knots Landing&quot; began incorporating this into its background music during season 12. Lance Rubin&#x27;s music cues were mostly phased out at this point. Patrick Gleeson and Kennard Ramsey composed during this period.

==Opening credits==
&quot;Knots Landing&quot; had five completely different styles of opening credits over its 14 years.
* (December 27, 1979 – March 26, 1981) The original opening of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; designed by Wayne Fitzgerald features a rotating aerial shot of a California beach which dissolves to a rotating aerial shot of roads and houses, gradually zooming in to a freeze-frame of the Seaview Circle cul-de-sac. The camera then zooms in to the top of each house in turn, showing a brief shot of the residents of each home. Photo credits for each of the main actors then appear superimposed over the shape of the cul-de-sac. In the pilot, however, it had the photo credits of the main actors shown superimposed over the house each of their characters live in.
* (November 12, 1981 – May 14, 1987) &quot;Knots Landing&quot; unveiled a new opening at the start of season 3. In what is probably the best-remembered introduction, the sequence designed by Gene Kraft begins with a fast-moving aerial shot of the ocean which then tilts up as it approaches the coastline, and the series title appears. The picture, except for the title, fades to black, and the title scrolls from right to left followed by a montage of clips of the show playing in small boxes. Each cast member is credited below a larger box showcasing a close-up of their character, accompanied by three or four smaller boxes showing that character in scenes with other characters.
* (September 24, 1987 – May 18, 1989) At the beginning of the ninth season, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; producers decided to break tradition with the opening. The intro designed by Sandy Dvore now features a slow-panning shot over a painting similar to the splattered style of Jackson Pollock. As the zig-zag panning continues, the cast montage appears, featuring black-and-white shots of the actors inside of small ovular cameos. The posed cameos were dropped in the 1988–89 season in favor of color close-ups taken from the show.
* (September 28, 1989 – May 17, 1990) The eleventh season of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; saw the show unveil its fourth title sequence. The new opening designed by Castle/Bryant/Johnsen now showcases sandcastle structures of the cul-de-sac houses as well as some skyscrapers representing Los Angeles on a beach. It is the only version of the opening without pictures of the cast. The camera twists through this sandcastle community with only the actors&#x27; names appearing. From the second episode of this season, the opening splits in two. The cutting takes place during the staff credits. The main theme is adapted as well. Between the two parts of the opening is presented a summary of events in the past episodes.
* (September 13, 1990 – May 13, 1993) To redefine the show for the 1990s, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; made one final change to the opening credits by returning to the famous horizontal scrolling clips style, though with faster-moving, color-framed boxes which moved at different speeds and overlapped each other, concluding with a shot of the sandcastle models of the cul-de-sac and Los Angeles from the previous title sequence. This version was designed by Castle/Bryant/Johnsen to be &quot;safe&quot; for the 1990s.

==Nielsen ratings==
Though not as popular in the ratings as its parent series, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; eventually outlasted it and garnered much critical acclaim. The series peaked during the 1983–84 season with a 20.8 rating (when it finished in 11th place) and a 20.0 rating for the 1984–85 season (finishing 9th). This can be attributed, in part, to more dramatic storylines as the series became more soap opera-like, and the gradual inclusion of newer characters to interact with the original cast. By the 1988–89 season, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; was ahead of &quot;Dallas&quot; in the ratings, though audiences for both shows by this time were less than their earlier years. &quot;Knots Landing&quot; ended in 1993, two years after &quot;Dallas&quot; ended.

==Reruns==
Reruns of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; were first packaged into syndication for off-network broadcast in local markets by Lorimar in 1985. Before the show opening, each episode was preceded by a &quot;Lorimar Presents&quot; logo, followed by a narrated recap of the previous episode with the theme music played under. The first 190 episodes (the first eight seasons) were packaged in this manner, but only the first 160 episodes (the first seven seasons) were syndicated to local stations.

&quot;Knots Landing&quot; later appeared on the cable channel TNT in September 1992 and ran through May 1993; as with the syndicated run, only the first 160 episodes (the first seven seasons) were broadcast. TNT would later become the first network to broadcast all 344 episodes of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; during its second syndication run of the series beginning in 1995.

SOAPnet later acquired the rights to the series when it first went on the air in January 2000. &quot;Knots Landing&quot; has not been seen in United States syndication since SOAPnet quit broadcasting it in 2005.

In August 2024, WB TV Primetime Soaps began airing this show on Amazon Prime Video Channels, which was previously named Freevee.

In September 2024, the streaming platform Plex has made all episodes available for viewing (free of charge) with some embedded commercial breaks.

===International reruns===
The UK satellite channel CBS Drama began airing the series in its entirety starting from April 1, 2013. This was the first time the show had been rerun in the UK since the early 2000s when it was shown on UK Gold. Once CBS Drama completed the series in July 2014, the channel immediately began a second round of reruns, followed by a third in 2015.

RTÉ television in Ireland broadcast the first seven seasons in an early morning weekend slot in 2011.

==Home media==
The first season of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; was released on DVD on March 28, 2006, in Region 1. Fans of the series lobbied Warner Home Video via an online petition at www.knotslanding.net for further releases, and Warner Home Video released season two on April 14, 2009. No further seasons have yet been announced for release.

As of 08/28/2024, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; season 1 became available for purchase on AppleTV; additionally, after a week of running the series 24/7, the first five seasons were released on demand from PlexTV in the United States.

Season 3 did not begin until September 16, 1983, but only the first 13 episodes of the season were shown, at which point the BBC pulled the series from its Friday night slot with no immediate plans of showing any more episodes. The BBC then brought the series back in October 1986, picking up from the middle of season 3 where they last left off, but now it was screened in the afternoon as part of their new daytime line-up.

==Legacy==
In the 2005 &quot;Knots Landing Reunion&quot; special, the cast along with creator David Jacobs, said that the lasting legacy of the show was their dealings with many of the issues real middle-class people were having. While its parent show &quot;Dallas&quot; was a show about the rich upper class, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; had this aspect as well but was much more about the struggles of parenting, drug addictions, spousal issues and many of the evolving problems in the 1980s and early &#x27;90s. The reunion special showed such subjects as: women&#x27;s power in the workforce, the HIV/AIDS crisis and the matter of safe sex, the cocaine epidemic in the 1980s, and the ever-growing spread of crime in America (Michele Lee&#x27;s character Karen alluded to this in a famous speech about not feeling safe and being happy being a Pollyanna).

Screenwriter Alan Ball declared the show had been an inspiration to him when he created the hit series &quot;Six Feet Under,&quot; describing his show as &quot;&quot;Knots Landing&quot; set in a funeral home&quot;.

Screenwriter Marc Cherry also confirmed the show was an inspiration to him when he created the hit series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, describing it as a cross between &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

When asked which character from film and TV history he wished he had created, Mike Kelley, the creator of ABC&#x27;s popular primetime soap opera &quot;Revenge&quot;, said: &quot;Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world.&quot;

<text>General Robert Prescott ( – 21 December 1815) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. During a military career which spanned over fifty years, he participated in the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American War of Independence, including key engagements such as the Montreal campaign. Prescott subsequently became the Governor of Martinique and then, in 1796, Governor General of the Canadas and Commander-in-Chief, North America. He was recalled to England in 1799 after conflict with the Catholic Church and disputes with Anglo-Canadian elites over land distribution. Prescott continued to hold his position until 1807, with his lieutenant governors acting in his absence. He died in 1815 after unsuccessful attempts to clear his name.

==Early life==

Modern sources generally agree that Robert Prescott was born in Lancashire in 1726 or 1727. Some sources, such as the &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot;, claim that he was the son of a cavalry officer named Richard Prescott, though the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; says that &quot;on what grounds [this] is not clear.&quot; Other sources also suggest that he was the brother of Colonel William Prescott, who fought in some of the same conflicts, although William Prescott was an American who was born in Massachusetts. Older sources differ from modern ones in some respects, with the 1896 &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; and the 1900 &quot;Appletons&#x27; Cyclopædia of American Biography&quot; both claiming that he was born in 1725; the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; further states that &quot;his family lost their estates owing to their opposition to the revolution of 1688.&quot;

The Dictionary of Canadian Biography is correct in its claim that General Prescott was the son of Captain Richard Prescott of Major-General Charles Sybourg&#x27;s Horse, now the 7th Dragoon Guards. In the will of Richard Prescott, of Hanover Street, London, proved in London on 7 April 1747, Captain Richard Prescott lists his five sons - Richard, Robert, Isaac, Arthur and William - and his four daughters - Mary, Sarah, Rebecca, and Elizabeth. When the eldest son, General Richard Prescott, died in 1788, he left legacies to his brother, General Robert Prescott (who was also an executor of his will), to his sisters, Rebecca, Sarah and Elizabeth, and to Robert&#x27;s daughter, Susanna Dalton. 

==Military career==

Prescott&#x27;s military career is much more well documented than his early life. He enlisted in the British Army in 1745 and became an ensign in the 15th Regiment of Foot. On 22 January 1755, he reached the rank of captain in the 15th Foot. With the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Prescott saw action in the 1757 raid on Rochefort, and in 1758, the 15th Foot sailed for North America to participate in the French and Indian War, an ongoing conflict which had become the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Prescott was present at the 1758 Siege of Louisbourg. He became an aide-de-camp to General Jeffery Amherst in 1759, participating in the Montreal campaign. Afterward he served under General James Wolfe. He also delivered despatches to England announcing the fall of Fort Lévis in 1760, which was near where the town of Prescott, Ontario would later be founded and named in his honour.

In January 1761, with the Anglo-Cherokee War ongoing, the 95th Regiment of Foot was formed in South Carolina under Ralph Burton. Robert Prescott became a major in the regiment on 22 March. The regiment took the field by May 1761 near Fort Prince George, which guarded the Cherokee Path and had been successfully raided by the Cherokee in the previous year. The regiment was soon sent to the West Indies along with a number of other American regiments to participate in the second invasion of Martinique, which followed an unsuccessful attempt in 1759. Prescott became lieutenant-colonel of the 72nd Regiment of Foot in November 1762, but the regiment disbanded the following year.

Prescott reappears in the military record with the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775. With the situation in the American colonies worsening for the British government, a number of units were mustered to be sent there. On 8 September 1775, he became lieutenant-colonel of the 28th Regiment of Foot, which had participated in the Montreal campaign during the French and Indian War. The regiment was sent to North America in May 1776. Later that year, in August, Prescott was present at the Battle of Long Island, after which the British captured New York City and Long Island from the Patriot forces. He also participated in several engagements in Westchester County, followed by the Battle of Fort Washington in November. He became a brevet-colonel on 29 August 1777. He was attached to the British expedition against Philadelphia, and two weeks later, on 11 September, he was present at the Battle of Brandywine, which was followed by the city&#x27;s capture by the British.

==Administrative career and death==

Prescott then served in the West Indies and became Governor of Martinique in 1794. In 1796, he became governor-in-chief of the Canadas, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, as well as Commander-in-Chief, North America. In his new position, he pursued a programme of improvements to military fortifications and infrastructure, which he found to be dilapidated and unsuitable for defense against external enemies, but was hampered by financial constraints. An attempt by colonial officials in Lower Canada to use corvée labour for a road improvement scheme led to widespread rioting, and the resulting unstable political situation in Canada over the winter of 1796–97 created what historian F. Murray Greenwood characterizes as a &quot;garrison mentality&quot; amongst Anglo-Canadian elites.

The possibility of an insurrection by French Canadians, which greatly outnumbered Anglo-Canadians, alarmed Prescott considerably. In an October 1796 letter to Home Secretary Lord Portland, he wrote that &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s English subjects here compared to the [French Canadians] are not in a greater proportion as Seventy to Two Thousand.&quot; Leading Anglo-Canadian elites such as Chief Justice William Osgoode and Attorney General Jonathan Sewell believed the riots over the road scheme were orchestrated by French ambassador to the U.S. Michel Ange Bernard Mangourit, and &quot;Prescott spent an uneasy winter fearing that the prevalence of secret meetings and inflammatory proclamations presaged a seditious conspiracy&quot;. 

In an atmosphere of panic and conspiracy, Prescott cracked down against perceived insurrectionists, resulting in the trial and execution of American merchant David McLane as a French spy. He also banned the immigration of Catholic priests from France, and placed the Catholic Church in Canada under strict surveillance, arguing that the colonial government should confiscate the estates held by the Sulpician order. However, his reluctance to directly violate the rights of Catholics led to conflict with the Anglican Bishop of Quebec, Jacob Mountain, who singlemindedly pursued Anglican supremacy over the Catholic Church.

Prescott was also faced with a refugee crisis, as many United Empire Loyalists and others who had fled United States to settle in Canada had still not received legal title to any lands, and had either returned to the US or began squatting on Canadian land instead. With responsibility for addressing the crisis falling to him as governor, Prescott devised a scheme designed to distinguish genuine settlers from land speculators by basing the size of township grants on the expenses incurred by the applicant, which also served to reward those who had begun to develop lands in anticipation of receiving a land title. This satisfied the majority of applicants, but angered speculators, as it limited their ability to profit from merely holding title to lands in Canada. Prescott began to suspect a conspiracy dating back to at least 1794 amongst members of the Executive Council, including Osgoode, Hugh Finlay (chairman of the land committee) and John Young, to exploit their official positions to acquire large tracts of land for themselves. 

The Executive Council condemned Prescott&#x27;s attempted solution to the land issue, leading him to believe that his suspicions had been confirmed. A military figure who was unaccustomed to politicking and perceived insubordination, Prescott lashed out against councillors, openly accusing them of land speculation and jobbery. In April 1799, attempts at reconciliation failed, and the British government recalled Prescott to England, despatching Sir Robert Milnes, 1st Baronet as lieutenant governor to manage Lower Canada in his absence. Milnes promptly granted the Executive Council the land grants they had pursued. After his return to England, Prescott endeavoured for some time to have an official inquiry made into his recall in order to exonerate himself. He officially remained in his position until 1807, but never returned to Lower Canada. He died on 21 December 1815 at Rose Green, West Sussex, aged about 89.

== Marriage and Family ==

On 18 January 1765, at All Saints&#x27; Church, Wakefield, Prescott married Susanna (d. April 1817, aged 73), daughter of William Serjeantson, of Kirkgate, Wakefield and Hanlith, Kirkby Malham, Yorkshire. They had two daughters and a son,

* Susanna (1766-1823), married at St Mary-le-bone, London, 10 March 1783, Lt. Col. John Dalton, 4th Light Dragoons, of Sleningford Hall, Ripon &amp; had issue. Their granddaughter, Susanna Dalbiac, married James Innes-Ker, 6th Duke of Roxburghe, and was a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria for thirty years.

*Rebecca (1768-1798) married in Quebec Lt. Col. John Baldwin, The 4th (King&#x27;s Own) Regiment of Foot, A.D.C. to General Prescott,and had issue. 

*Serjeantson (1784-1816), Lt. Col. 5th Dragoon Guards, m. in Battle, Sussex, 20 December 1808, Mary Falkiner, daughter of Caleb Falkiner, and granddaughter of Sir Riggs Falkiner, 1st Bt., of Cork, Ireland. He was killed by a cricket ball at Rose Green, Sussex, leaving issue.

<doc id="581488" wikidata="Q6524050" url="?curid=581488" title="Leo McLeay">
<text>Leo Boyce McLeay (born 4 October 1945) is a former Australian politician who served as a Labor Party member of the House of Representatives from June 1979 to October 2004. He was Speaker of the House of Representatives 1989–93. During 1992 he was unsuccessfully censured by John Hewson, at the time Opposition Leader, with a motion of no confidence; Hewson accused McLeay of political bias.

==Early life==
McLeay was born on 4 October 1945 in Marrickville, New South Wales. He was the older of two children born to Joan Ann and Ronald Boyce McLeay. His father was a council worker and worked on the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

McLeay attended De La Salle College, Marrickville. He left school before obtaining a leaving certificate and began working as a post office telegram boy. In 1962 he joined the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department as a telephone technician, receiving further training at North Sydney Technical College. He was a member of the Postal Telecommunication Technicians&#x27; Association and the Federated Clerks&#x27; Union.

==Early political involvement==
McLeay joined the ALP at the age of 13 and was state secretary of Young Labor in 1969. He served on the Marrickville Municipal Council from 1971 to 1977. He became a paid ALP employee with the support of Graham Richardson, initially as an organiser and then as assistant general secretary of the state branch from 1976 to 1979.

==Politics==
McLeay was elected to federal parliament at the 1979 Grayndler by-election, following the death in office of Frank Stewart. He joined a number of parliamentary committees and in 1982 chaired the subcommittee that delivered the &quot;In a Home or at Home&quot; report on aged care. He was elected chairman of committees in 1986, serving as deputy to Joan Child, and was elected as her replacement upon her retirement in 1989.

McLeay represented the Division of Grayndler from 1979 until 1993. In 1993, the Division of Phillip was due to be abolished, and its sitting member Jeannette McHugh had become a minister and was entitled to a seat. Therefore, McHugh transferred to Grayndler, forcing McLeay to transfer to Division of Watson which he held until 2004.

McLeay was Chair of Committees and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives 1986–89, and Speaker of the House 1989–93. He, Neil Andrew and Bronwyn Bishop are the only three speakers to be subject to motions of no confidence (which were defeated in all cases on party lines). He resigned as Speaker following accusations that he had made a false compensation claim of $65,000 following a bicycle accident. This accusation was later shown to be incorrect. McLeay was subsequently Chief Government Whip 1993–96 and Chief Opposition Whip 1996–2001. He retired at the 2004 election.

==Later career==
After leaving parliament Leo McLeay became a Director of the Mary MacKillop Foundation in 2005. He was also the New South Wales director of the Enhance Group.

==Personal life==
Leo has three sons - Mark, Paul and Marten. Paul McLeay was the Member for Heathcote in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 2003 until his defeat at the 2011 state election.

<doc id="581506" wikidata="Q62367" url="?curid=581506" title="Ijevan">
<text>Ijevan ( ) is a town and urban municipal community in the Ijevan Municipality of the Tavush Province of Armenia, also serving as the province&#x27;s administrative centre. It is located at the center of the region, at the foot of Ijevan ridge of Gugark Mountains, on the shores of Aghstev River. Ijevan is the seat of the Diocese of Tavush of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

Ijevan is located at a road distance of 137 km northeast of Yerevan. The Yerevan-Tbilisi highway passes through Ijevan. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town was 21,081, making it the most populated town in the province. Ijevan is also famous for its beautiful mountains.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s current name &quot;Ijevan&quot;, and its former name &quot;Karavansara&quot; (until 1919), both mean &quot;inn&quot; (caravanserai), in Armenian and Persian, respectively. The area of modern-day Ijevan used to have many roadside inns known as caravanserais that served travelers between historic Syria and the North Caucasus. The name &quot;Ijevan&quot; became official in 1961 when the settlement became a town.

==History==
Chamber tombs found at the centre of present-day Ijevan, as well as late Bronze Age cemetery on the left bank of Aghstev river, attest to the early occupation of the site.

Historically, the area of modern-day Ijevan was part of ancient Utik and Gugark; the 12th and 13th provinces of Greater Armenia respectively. Separated by the Aghstev river, the eastern half of Ijevan was part of the Tuchkatak canton of the historic Utik, while the western half belonged to the Dzorapor canton of the historic Gugark.

Being located on a vital route of trade between the Levant and Northern Caucasus, the region of present-day Ijevan was home to many rest-houses and caravanserais during the Middle Ages, serving as rest-houses for the passing merchants and their caravans, mainly on the road from Tbilisi to Dvin. The remains of a medieval caravanserai stands on the banks of Aghstev river on a site called Hamam-Jala.

Under the Persian rule who had gained control over the Eastern Armenian territories since 1501–02, the village of Karavansara was founded during the 1780s. The territories of present-day Lori and Tavush along with the neighboring Georgia, became part of the Russian Empire in 1800–01. The territories became an official region of Russia as per the Treaty of Gulistan signed between Imperial Russia and Qajar Persia in October 1813, following the Russo-Persian War of 1804–13.

In 1840, the Elizavetpol uezd was formed and most of the territories of Tavush became part of the newly founded administrative division of the Russian Empire. Later in 1868, the Elizavetpol Governorate was established and Tavush became part of the newly formed Kazakh uezd. Under the Russian rule, approximately 6,000 Armenian families from Karabakh were allowed to move to the valley of Aghstev river to be resettled in the region of Tavush including the territory of the village of Karavansara. The village witnessed a notable revival during the 1860s and 1870s, as a result of the new road opened between Kazakh (Qazax) and Erivan (Yerevan), passing through Karavansara.

Following the 1918 independence of Armenia, the name of Karavansara was changed to &quot;Ijevan&quot; in 1919. On 29 November 1920, Ijevan, along with Noyemberyan, was the first Armenian settlement where Soviet rule was established, after being invaded by the Red Army from Soviet Azerbaijan in the northeastern part of the country. In 1930, it became the centre of the newly formed Ijevan raion.

The first major plan of the town was adopted in 1948, revised later in 1967. In 1951, the Ijevan Wine-Brandy Factory was opened, followed by the rug and carpet factory in opened in 1959–65. With the gradual development of the industrial sector, Ijevan was given the status of a town in 1961. In 1970, it was turned into a city of republican sub-ordination of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Following the independence of Armenia in 1991, Ijevan became the provincial centre of the newly founded Tavush Province as per the administrative reforms of 1995.

==Demographics==

Ijevan is the largest urban community of Tavush. The majority of the town&#x27;s population are ethnic Armenians who belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The regulating body of the church is the Diocese of Tavush, headed by Archbishop Yeznik Petrosyan.

The seat of the Diocese of Tavush is the Surp Nerses Cathedral in Ijevan opened in 1997, after the reconstruction of a former cultural centre built by the Soviets in the 1950s. The project was financed by the US-based Armenian benefactors Kevork and Berjuhi Nersesian from Boston. The other church of the town known as the Holy Saviour&#x27;s was consecrated in 2012. Financed by the Ukraine-based Ghazaryan family who are natives of Ijevan, the church was built between 2009 and 2012 on the foundations of a 19th-century church ruined during the Soviet days.

As of the 2011 census, the population of the town was 21,081, making it the most populated town in the province. As per the 2016 official estimate, the population of Ijevan is around 20,700.

==Culture==
According to popular tradition, King Artavasdes I built a city on the territory of present-day Ijevan during his reign in the 2nd century BC. He gathered only attractive girls and boys from all over Armenian regions, so that later they would get married and settle in the newly established town. Thus, the citizens of modern-day Ijevan are the successors of the handsome generations formed 2000 years ago.

Ijevan and its countryside are home to several cultural heritage monuments of the Armenian Architecture, including:
*Surp Hovhannes Church of the 13th century, located at the west of the town.
*Makaravank monastery of the 10th century located around 15 km north of Ijevan near the Achajur village. This purple and green stone complex in the forest above the village is a tourist destination.
