<text>&quot;I Borg&quot; is the 23rd episode of the fifth season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the 123rd overall. It was originally aired on May 10, 1992, in broadcast syndication. The episode was written by René Echevarria, with help from executive producer Jeri Taylor. It was directed by Robert Lederman, the film editor for &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, one of two directing credits he received during the course of the season.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. An injured Borg drone (Jonathan Del Arco) is found amid a crashed scout ship. As they restore him to health, the crew must decide whether or not to develop him as a weapon of mass destruction against the Borg; when he demonstrates free will, choosing the name Hugh, they must question that decision.

The writers had problems bringing back the Borg due to their apparent near-invincibility. The idea for &quot;I, Borg&quot; was well received among the staff, with Taylor comparing it to the film &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. The episode also saw a development in the make-up design for the Borg by Michael Westmore&#x27;s team. Del Arco was deliberately antisocial prior to his audition to get into the role but also sought to use the innocence and wonderment generated by a friend&#x27;s death as Hugh&#x27;s voice. He was pleased when the character later returned in the two-part episode &quot;Descent&quot;. The episode received Nielsen ratings of 12.8 percent and critics were positive with praise directed at both Del Arco and Whoopi Goldberg, as well as the general nature of the plot.

==Plot==
The crew discover a wrecked Borg scout ship with a single survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard&#x27;s orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they come to understand the workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data devise an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.

The Borg drone initially calls himself &quot;Third of Five&quot;, but ends up referring to and understanding himself as &quot;Hugh&quot; – the name given to him by La Forge. Hugh discusses how the Borg only wish to learn about other cultures through assimilation, but La Forge counters this argument, discussing aspects of individuality that make them human and unique. In further debates, La Forge finds himself becoming a friend to Hugh, and begins to doubt his previous idea. This is further complicated when Hugh shows elements of individualism. The crew now debate whether it is appropriate to sacrifice one individual to protect the majority, though Picard is still insistent on destroying the Collective. Crusher and La Forge arrange to have Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who has a similar loathing for the Borg because they destroyed her homeworld, speak to Hugh.

She finds Hugh to be not a mindless drone but a confused young man, and she agrees Hugh is no longer a Borg. Guinan convinces Picard to meet with Hugh, as well, and Picard comes to the same conclusion, in part because Hugh refers to himself as &quot;I&quot; instead of the Borg&#x27;s collective &quot;we&quot; during their discussion. Picard abandons the proposed plan and instead offers Hugh asylum within the Federation. Hugh expresses enthusiasm at the prospect of remaining with La Forge but ultimately refuses, recognizing that the Borg will still come looking for him. He offers to be returned to the crash site, where he will be found and re-assimilated by the Borg. Picard hopes that, once Hugh is reconnected, the sense of individualism Hugh has learned will spread throughout the Collective. La Forge accompanies Hugh to the crash site and, from a safe distance, watches the Borg recover him. Just as the Borg transport out, Hugh turns to give La Forge a parting glance.

==Production==
Following the Borg-based two-part episode &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, the production team were having difficulty in introducing the Borg to the series due to their unstoppable nature. The story idea for &quot;I, Borg&quot; was well received by the production staff, with executive producer Rick Berman saying that he &quot;fell in love&quot; with the characterisations of Guinan, Picard, La Forge and Hugh which resulted in a series of two character scenes in the episode. Story editor René Echevarria wrote the script, with an uncredited assist from executive producer Jeri Taylor. She compared the idea to the film &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990), saying that she felt it would become a &quot;classic&quot; and that the Borg &quot;would never be the same again&quot;. Michael Piller, who wrote &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, described &quot;I, Borg&quot; as having a &quot;great premise which forces Guinan and Picard to face their own prejudices&quot;. He said it was his favourite of the season.

The episode was directed by Robert Lederman, his first of the series and the only new director during the fifth season. Lederman was also the film editor on the series, and later directed the episode &quot;Force of Nature&quot;. &quot;I, Borg&quot; also marked the first time that Jay Chattaway scored a Borg-related episode; Chattaway continued to do so for the rest of the series and during &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

===Design and casting of Hugh===

The design of the Borg prosthetics as used in &quot;I, Borg&quot; was an evolution from those previously seen in the series. Michael Westmore&#x27;s make-up team developed a removable eye-piece for Hugh, using magnets to allow the actor to remove it as required by the script. The team wanted the eye-piece to be dramatic, but decided against using a laser as this had been previously used for Locutus of Borg. They instead opted for a hologram and a series of LEDs that were powered by a battery pack built into the costume and mounted on the actor&#x27;s back. The arm piece was also redeveloped; rather than a single &quot;club&quot; piece as previously used for the Borg, it was built from a foam-rubber glove with attachments.

Jonathan Del Arco had no concept of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He received his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that it gave him a decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately antisocial towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh&#x27;s mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more. He had previously done a screen test for the role of character Wesley Crusher.

He said that his performance in &quot;I, Borg&quot; was driven by the memories of watching a childhood friend die, and the innocence that he felt given to his friend&#x27;s memory over time; &quot;When I first read the script. I heard his voice, that&#x27;s what it sounded like – full of wonderment and confusion about everything. That, to me, was Hugh.&quot; Following his appearance in the episode, he later pitched a couple of story ideas to the producers to feature the return of Hugh. He was happy when the character later returned in the sixth season finale/seventh season opener &quot;Descent&quot;, which he felt was similar to his previous ideas.

==Reception==
The episode aired during the week commencing May 10, 1992, in broadcast syndication. According to Nielsen Media Research, it received ratings of 12.8 percent. This means that it was watched by 12.8 percent of all households watching television during its timeslot. When broadcast it was the seventh most watched episode of the season, behind both parts of &quot;Unification&quot;, &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;, &quot;Power Play&quot;, &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;.

Keith DeCandido in his review for Tor.com gave the episode a score of 8 out of 10, and described Goldberg&#x27;s appearance as &quot;particularly good&quot;, while Del Arco was said to be &quot;spectacular&quot; in his &quot;subtle, powerful performance&quot;. DeCandido criticised the &quot;defanging&quot; of the Borg, but understood why the writers took the approach they did as a near-unstoppable enemy is difficult to write for. He praised the characterisations, specifically for Crusher, and added &quot;it’s never a bad thing when &quot;TNG&quot; actually remembers its character continuity&quot;. James Van Hise, in his book &quot;The Complete Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, said that the episode &quot;enriched the creative tapestry of the series&quot; and gave the writers a number of possibilities for following it up.

Zack Handlen gave &quot;I, Borg&quot; a grade of A− in his review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, and while he was disappointed that the Borg were made less &quot;nightmarish&quot;, the question of genocide that hung over the episode and the expansion of potential story ideas from the plot made it worth it.
In a SyFy review of 25 greatest science fiction episodes between 1992 and 2017, &quot;I, Borg&quot; was the only &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode selected, although this excluded any episodes before 1993 or so.
&quot;Empire&quot; ranked this the 34th best out of the top 50 episodes of the 700 plus &quot;Star Trek&quot; television episodes.
&quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked &quot;I, Borg&quot; the sixth best episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. &quot;Variety&quot; ranked it as the 13th best episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked it among a top twenty five episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Sven Harvey included &quot;I, Borg&quot; in a list of 25 &quot;must watch&quot; episodes of the series compiled for &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, describing it as &quot;a wonderfully written and executed episode which lays a path for later developments&quot;.
&quot;Newsweek&quot; noted this episode for emergence of independent identity, and of empathy and forgiveness. They remark, &quot;As the Borg, cut off from the collective mind, begins to recognize itself as an individual, so do Picard and Guinan.&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;Forbes&quot; noted this episode as exploring the implications of advanced technology, showing how an isolated Borg alien must learn how to be an individual.&quot;&quot;

&quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Jonathan Del Arco as in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; as one of the top ten guest star roles on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. He appears in the role of Third of Five (i.e. Hugh), in &quot;I, Borg&quot; and &quot;Descent, Part II&quot;.

===Watch guides===
The &quot;Nerdist&quot; included this episode as part of a story arc of this TV show. They propose a story arc with the Enterprise 1701-D confronting the Borg, that would include &quot;Q Who?&quot;, &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, &quot;I, Borg&quot;, and &quot;Descent&quot;.

SyFy Wire recommended this episode for binge watching, noting how the episode introduces the recovering Borg &#x27;Hugh&#x27; played by Jonathan Del Arco.

== Home media release ==
&quot;I Borg&quot; was first released on VHS cassette in the United States and Canada on October 7, 1997. The episode was later released in the United States on November 5, 2002, as part of the season five DVD box set. It was subsequently released as part of the &quot;Star Trek: Fan Collective – Borg&quot; collection on DVD, which brought together the Borg-themed episodes from &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. The first Blu-ray release was in the United States on November 19, 2013, followed by the United Kingdom on November 18.

== &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; ==
In summer 2019, it was announced that Del Arco would reprise his role as Hugh in the television show &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, going on to appear in three episodes during season 1 of that series.

<text>ARA &quot;San Luis&quot; (S-32) was a Type 209 diesel-powered submarine of the Argentine Navy. Built in Germany, &quot;San Luis&quot; has a displacement of and was commissioned in 1974. The submarine operated against the Royal Navy during the Falklands War without any noticeable success, but survived a number of anti-submarine sweeps carried out by British frigates. &quot;San Luis&quot; was struck in 1997 after an incomplete overhaul; as of 2020, its hull remained stored at Domecq Garcia Shipyard (Tandanor).

== Design ==
The Type 209 submarine was designed by Ingenieurkontor Lübeck (IKL) headed by Ulrich Gabler and is largely based on previous German submarine designs (in particular the Type 206) with increased equipment. The design is single hulled and allows the commanding officer to see the entire submarine from the bow to stern while standing at the periscope. Four 120-cell batteries are located forward and aft of the command center in the lower deck and make up about 25% of the boat&#x27;s displacement. Two main ballast tanks with forward and aft trim tanks allow the boat to dive. They are powered by four MTU diesels and four AEG generators.

== History ==

=== Falklands War ===
&quot;San Luis&quot; served in the Falklands War () of 1982. Only one other submarine, the Second World War-era , was operational at this time. After &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was damaged, captured and scuttled by the British during the re-taking of South Georgia on 28 April, and the nuclear submarine had sunk the cruiser on 2 May, the Argentine fleet retired to port for the duration of the war, with the exception of &quot;San Luis&quot;, making her the only Argentine naval presence facing the British fleet.

&quot;San Luis&quot; was a major concern for the British as she presented a serious danger to all British warships in the area. Sea, depth and thermal conditions around the Falklands were favourable to diesel submarines, and difficult for anti-submarine ships. The Royal Navy (RN) aircraft carriers and were the priority targets for &quot;San Luis&quot;. Sources conflict on whether &quot;San Luis&quot; was capable of finding and attacking the RN carriers. Considerations include that the RN aircraft carriers were confined to operate east of the Falklands within sectors determined by the range of Sea Harrier, the ability of the Argentines to intercept RN ships&#x27; satellite communications, and to a degree by Soviet intelligence assistance.

&quot;San Luis&quot; reported two attacks on Royal Navy ships during the war. On 1 May, the frigates and were sent to hunt down &quot;San Luis&quot;, then operating north of Stanley. &quot;San Luis&quot; reported firing a German-made SST-4 torpedo, on purely passive sonar detection of British gas turbine-powered warship(s) and Sea King helicopters searching. The torpedo missed its target, presumably due to range, malfunctioning of the computer fire control system, gyro misalignment and the breakage of the wire guidance wire. Nevertheless, experts believe that a closer range attack or alternative use of the MK 37 in an anti-ship role might have been successful. Sonar operators aboard &quot;Brilliant&quot; were certain they heard and confirmed the sound of an SST-4, and &quot;Brilliant&quot;, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; and three Sea Kings from &quot;Hermes&quot;″s 826 Naval Air Squadron launched depth charge, mortar and torpedo attacks for 20 hours until the short sub-Antarctic night on 1 May. Searching for the Type 209 submarine was hindered by the numerous wrecks of whaling boats and whales, indistinguishable from submarines. &quot;San Luis&quot; had adopted the World War II tactics of German U-boats and rested on the bottom some distance from the area of interest to the British frigates, where it shut down. During the short Falklands War, the United States supplied 200 Mk 46 torpedoes to the Royal Navy, which expended 50 Mk 46 torpedoes during the conflict against sonar detection of the possible sound of the single Type 209 submarine. The Royal Navy never detected or located the submarine, which was in among the fleet, but whose weapon system effectiveness had been limited by British Intelligence.

&quot;San Luis&quot; attacked again on the night of 10 May. The frigate had made passage up Falkland Sound, sinking an Argentine merchant navy ship on the way. As &quot;Alacrity&quot; left the channel before dawn, sister ship was waiting to accompany her back to the Task Force. &quot;San Luis&quot; detected the two ships and fired two SST-4 torpedoes, one of which did not leave its tube; the other was apparently defeated by &quot;Arrow&quot;″s anti-torpedo measures. It seems that the torpedo hit &quot;Arrow&quot;&#x27;s towed decoy. In the subsequent counter-attack, &quot;San Luis&quot; survived a 25-hour chase, which included the use of depth-charges. There were several problems with torpedoes and torpedo systems; in particular it appears that the torpedoes were not prepared properly, and did not arm themselves after firing, so would not explode even if they did hit a target. It has been suggested that previous apparent misses could have been due to torpedoes which struck home but did not explode. After the Falklands War ended, German and Dutch engineers were sent to Argentina to discover what went wrong with their torpedoes. The problem was found to be that one of the Argentine Navy technicians who were in charge of periodic maintenance of the torpedoes had inadvertently reversed the polarity of power cables between the torpedoes and the submarine. This meant that when the torpedoes&#x27; gyros were spun up, they ran &quot;backwards&quot; and thus tumbled on launch, preventing the weapons from taking up their proper heading.

The mere presence of &quot;San Luis&quot; was a severe nuisance to the Task Force. The threat posed by the Argentine submarine forced the Royal Navy to suspend the rescue efforts of two Sea King helicopters who ditched at sea on 12 May and 18 May 1982 respectively, while conducting anti-submarine operations. Both aircraft were eventually scuttled by naval gunfire.

&quot;San Luis&quot; returned to Puerto Belgrano on 17 May for repairs to her weapons systems, and was not operational for the rest of the war.

=== Post-war ===
After a failed overhaul, &quot;San Luis&quot; was decommissioned in 1997. Its hull remains stored at Tandanor shipyard, in Buenos Aires.

<doc id="562937" wikidata="Q741058" url="?curid=562937" title="William Gibbs McAdoo">
<text>William Gibbs McAdoo Jr. (October 31, 1863 – February 1, 1941) was an American lawyer and statesman. McAdoo was a leader of the Progressive movement and played a major role in the administration of his father-in-law President Woodrow Wilson. A member of the Democratic Party, he also represented California in the United States Senate.

Born in Marietta, Georgia, McAdoo moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in his youth and graduated from the University of Tennessee. He established a legal practice in Chattanooga, Tennessee, before moving to New York City in 1892. He gained fame as the president of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company and served as the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. McAdoo worked on Wilson&#x27;s successful 1912 presidential campaign and served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1913 to 1918. He married Wilson&#x27;s daughter, Eleanor, in 1914. McAdoo presided over the establishment of the Federal Reserve System and helped prevent an economic crisis after the outbreak of World War I. After the U.S. entered the war, McAdoo also served as the Director General of Railroads. McAdoo left Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet in 1919, co-founding the law firm of McAdoo, Cotton &amp; Franklin.

McAdoo sought the Democratic presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention but was opposed by his father-in-law, President Woodrow Wilson, who hoped to be nominated for a third term. In 1922, McAdoo left his law firm and moved to California. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination again in 1924, but the 1924 Democratic National Convention nominated John W. Davis. He was elected to the Senate in 1932 but was defeated in his bid for a second term. McAdoo died of a heart attack in 1941 while traveling from the third inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

==Early life and career==
McAdoo was born during the middle of the Civil War in the historic William Gibbs McAdoo House in Marietta, Georgia. He was the son of author Mary Faith Floyd (1832–1913) and attorney William Gibbs McAdoo (1820–1894). His uncle, John David McAdoo, was a Confederate general and a justice of the Texas Supreme Court. McAdoo attended rural schools until his family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1877, when his father became a professor at the University of Tennessee.

He graduated from the University of Tennessee and was a member of the Lambda chapter of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He was appointed deputy clerk of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee in 1882. He married his first wife, Sarah Hazelhurst Fleming, on November 18, 1885. They had seven children: Harriet Floyd McAdoo, Francis Huger McAdoo, Julia Hazelhurst McAdoo, Nona Hazelhurst McAdoo, William Gibbs McAdoo III, Robert Hazelhurst McAdoo, and Sarah Fleming McAdoo.

He was admitted to the bar in Tennessee in 1885 and set up a practice in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In the early 1890s, he lost most of his money trying to electrify the Knoxville Street Railroad system. In 1892 he moved to New York City, where he met Francis R. Pemberton, son of the Confederate General John C. Pemberton. They formed a firm, Pemberton and McAdoo, to sell investment securities.

In 1895, McAdoo returned to Knoxville and regained control of part of his bankrupt streetcar company, which had been auctioned off. In subsequent months, he engaged in a struggle with Ohio businessman C.C. Howell over control of the city&#x27;s streetcar system, culminating in a bizarre incident known as the Battle of Depot Street. Litigation in the aftermath of this incident favored Howell, and McAdoo abandoned his streetcar endeavors in 1897 and returned to New York.

Around 1900, McAdoo took on the leadership of a project to build the Uptown Hudson Tubes, a pair of railroad tunnels under the Hudson River connecting Manhattan with New Jersey. A tunnel had been partially constructed during the 1880s by Dewitt Clinton Haskin. With McAdoo as president of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company, two passenger tubes were completed and opened in 1908. The popular McAdoo told the press that his motto was &quot;Let the Public be Pleased.&quot; The tunnels are now part of the PATH train system. As part of publicizing the tunnels, McAdoo gave tours to political leaders and foreign dignitaries. He met Woodrow Wilson in 1910, near the end of Wilson&#x27;s tenure as the president of Princeton University. McAdoo campaigned for Wilson when Wilson ran for governor of New Jersey later that year. He went on to serve as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee and co-chair of Wilson&#x27;s successful 1912 presidential campaign. McAdoo&#x27;s wife died in February 1912.

==Secretary of the Treasury==
After taking office as president, Wilson appointed McAdoo secretary of the Treasury, a post McAdoo held from 1913 to 1918.

He married the president&#x27;s daughter Eleanor Randolph Wilson at the White House on May 7, 1914. They had two daughters, Ellen Wilson McAdoo (1915–1946) and Mary Faith McAdoo (1920–1988). Ellen married twice and had two children. Mary married three times, but had no children. McAdoo&#x27;s second marriage ended in divorce in July 1935, and he married a third time at nearly 72, to 26 year old nurse Doris Isabel Cross (1909–2005), in September 1935.

McAdoo offered to resign after his wedding, but President Wilson urged him to complete his work of turning the Federal Reserve System into an operational central bank. The legislation establishing the System had been passed by Congress in December 1913.

As head of the Department of the Treasury, McAdoo confronted a major financial crisis on the eve and at the outbreak of World War I, in July and August 1914. At the time, the United States was still a net debtor nation (i.e., Americans&#x27; aggregate debt to foreigners was greater than foreigners&#x27; aggregate debt to Americans). The nations of Europe and their financial institutions held far more in debt of the United States, of many of the states of the Union, and of American private institutions of all kinds; than investors in the United States held in the debt of Europe&#x27;s nations and institutions in all forms, both public and private. During the last week of July 1914, British and French investors began to liquidate their American securities holdings into U.S. currency. Many of these foreign investors then converted their dollars into gold, as was common practice in international monetary transactions at the time, in order to repatriate their holdings back to Europe. If continued, these actions would have depleted the gold backing for the dollar, possibly inducing a depression in American financial markets and in the American economy as a whole. Investors might then have been able to buy American goods and raw materials (for their war effort) at greatly depressed prices, which Americans would have had to accept in order to restart the economy from a consciously (albeit inadvertently) caused depression.
McAdoo&#x27;s actions, then, were both bold and outrageous: keeping the U.S. currency on the gold standard, he arranged the closing of the New York Stock Exchange for an unprecedented four months to prevent Europeans from selling American securities and exchanging the proceeds for dollars and gold.

Investors in the warring countries thus had no access to their holdings of U.S. financial assets at the outset of the war. As a result, the treasuries of those countries more quickly exhausted all of their net foreign exchange holdings (those that were on hand and in their possession before McAdoo closed the markets), currency, and gold reserves. Some of them then issued sovereign bonded indebtedness (IOUs) to pay for the war materials they were buying on the American and other markets.

Economist William L. Silber wrote that the wisdom and historical impact of this action cannot be overemphasized. McAdoo&#x27;s bold stroke, Silber writes, averted an immediate panic and collapse of the American financial and stock markets. It also laid the groundwork for a historic and decisive shift in the global balance of economic power, from Europe to the United States; a shift which occurred exactly at that time. More than this, McAdoo&#x27;s actions both saved the American economy and its future allies from economic defeat in the early stages of the war.

Silber wrote that the intact and undamaged American financial system and its markets managed the flow and operation of this financing more easily than they would have without McAdoo&#x27;s measures, and that U.S. industry swiftly built up to the scale needed to meet the allied war needs. The managed liquidation of foreign holdings of U.S. assets moved the United States to a net creditor position internationally and with Europe from the net debtor position it had held prior to 1915.

In order to prevent a replay of the bank suspensions that plagued America during the Panic of 1907, McAdoo also invoked the emergency-currency provisions of the 1908 Aldrich–Vreeland Act. Silber credits his actions for having turned America into a world financial power, in his book &quot;When Washington Shut Down Wall Street&quot;.

Like President Wilson, McAdoo was a segregationist. During his tenure as Secretary, he broke with long-standing policy and ordered implementation of Jim Crow in all Treasury facilities, even in the north where they had previously not existed. McAdoo told reporter Oswald Garrison Villard that racial segregation was needed in the Treasury to prevent friction.

==Later political career==

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the United States Railroad Administration was formed to run America&#x27;s transportation system during the war. McAdoo was appointed Director General of Railroads, a position he held until the armistice in November 1918.

In March 1919, after leaving the Wilson cabinet, McAdoo co-founded the law firm McAdoo, Cotton &amp; Franklin, now known as white shoe firm Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel. His law firm served as general counsel for the founders of United Artists, with McAdoo taking a 20 percent stake in the common shares of the joint venture, while founders Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith each held a 25 percent stake in the preferred shares and a 20 percent stake of the common shares. He left the firm in 1922 and moved to California to concentrate on his political career.

===1920 and 1924 campaigns for President===
McAdoo ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, losing to James M. Cox in 1920, and to John W. Davis in 1924, even though in both years he led on the first ballot. While campaigning in the run-up to the 1920 presidential election, McAdoo voiced his support for such measures as injury compensation, unemployment insurance, and the eight-hour workday, while also expressing his support for the idea of permanent federal legislation in the labor sphere, especially concerning unemployment compensation and a minimum wage.

A committed Prohibition supporter, McAdoo&#x27;s first presidential bid was scuttled by the New York state delegation and other Northern opponents of the banning of alcohol at the 1920 Democratic National Convention. After defeating his chief rival for the nomination, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, McAdoo finally lost the party nomination to dark horse candidate Governor James M. Cox of Ohio when the delegates decided in his favor on the 44th ballot.

McAdoo was again a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1924. Widely regarded as the front-runner in 1923, McAdoo&#x27;s candidacy was badly hurt by the revelation that he had previously accepted a $25,000 contribution from Edward L. Doheny, an oil tycoon implicated in 1922 in the Teapot Dome scandal. McAdoo had returned the normal-course contribution once he learned of Doheny&#x27;s possible bribes to Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall to get oil leases. At the 1924 Democratic National Convention, McAdoo received the support of the friends of the Ku Klux Klan. He refused to repudiate the KKK causing the Catholic vote to turn against him. McAdoo defeated Oscar Underwood, who was an opponent of the Ku Klux Klan and Prohibition, in the Georgia primary and split the Alabama delegation. McAdoo led after the first ballot of the convention, with his greatest challenger being New York Governor Al Smith. After dozens of ballots, and numerous brawls between McAdoo&#x27;s and Smith&#x27;s supporters, compromise candidate John W. Davis won the nomination on the 103rd ballot.

=== 1923 Los Angeles Bus System Proposal ===
In February 1923, McAdoo and a consortium of eastern investors attempted to establish the first city bus service in Los Angeles. The Peoples&#x27; Motor Bus Company was to cover 60 miles of Los Angeles streets with double-decker buses. The scheme was defeated by a public referendum in favor of a competing proposal by the Pacific Electric Railway and Los Angeles Railway.

=== Senator from California: 1933–1938===
From 1932 to 1940, McAdoo served as a member of the Democratic National Committee. At the 1932 Democratic National Convention, he played an important role in switching California&#x27;s support from presidential candidate John Nance Garner to Franklin D. Roosevelt, which aided Roosevelt in obtaining the nomination. In 1932, he was the successful Democratic nominee for a seat in the United States Senate. He won the Senate seat in a three-way race with 43% of the vote; Republican Tallant Tubbs won 31%, and Prohibitionist &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; Shuler won 26%. He served from 1933 until November 1938; after losing renomination to Sheridan Downey, he resigned a few weeks before the completion of his term. In the Senate, McAdoo was one of the authors of the 1933 Banking Act. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Patents from 1934 to 1938. He voted to invoke cloture on the Anti-Lynching Bill of 1937, but the bill failed to receive enough votes for cloture to override a filibuster by Southern Democrats. In 1937, McAdoo introduced a successful bill that enabled the federal government to purchase a large timber holding from the Yosemite Lumber Company and bring it within the boundaries of Yosemite National Park.

McAdoo&#x27;s wife filed for divorce in 1934. Two months after their decree was finalized in July 1935, the 71-year-old McAdoo married Doris Isabel Cross, a 26-year-old nurse.

== Death ==
McAdoo died on February 1, 1941, of a heart attack while traveling in Washington, D.C., after the third inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

==Legacy==
McAdoo was enormously appealing with his handsome looks, obvious enthusiasm and boundless energy. He had an uncomplex personality that was always persuasive, optimistic and self-assured. What was lacking was depth or commitment to deep principles.

He excelled first as a maverick promoter and businessman who supported antitrust measures that were favored by the progressive movement. The World War enormously enlarged his scope of Treasury Department activities, giving him a strong voice in all major foreign and domestic policies, with major impact on the entire economy.

In the 1920s, as his Democratic Party polarized, he took the side of rural America, especially the South, as opposed to Al Smith&#x27;s big cities. He never supported the Ku Klux Klan, but on the other hand refused to denounce it when so many loyal Democrats belonged. McAdoo and Smith stalemated each other in the fierce competition for the 1924 presidential nomination.

In 1932, he helped stop Al Smith and instead promoted Franklin Roosevelt for the nomination. He supported the New Deal, but he was no longer comfortable with the growing radicalism in California in the mid-1930s, and was defeated for reelection in 1938.

McAdoo was played by Vincent Price in the 1944 biopic &quot;Wilson&quot;. He is a significant character in the Glen David Gold novel &quot;Sunnyside&quot;, encouraging Charlie Chaplin to help with efforts to raise funds for World War I before advising him on the formation of United Artists. McAdoo&#x27;s former home in Chattanooga&#x27;s Fort Wood neighborhood has been restored and is now a private residence.

The town of McAdoo in Dickens County, Texas, is named for him. McAdoo&#x27;s Seafood Company, a restaurant in New Braunfels, Texas, also bears his name.

McAdoo is quoted as having said, &quot;It is impossible to defeat an ignorant man in an argument.&quot; And in reference to Warren Harding, McAdoo said his public utterances were &quot;an army of pompous phrases moving over the landscape in search of an idea.&quot;

<text>Crossharbour is a light metro station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Bank-Lewisham Line in Cubitt Town, East London. The station is situated on the Isle of Dogs and is between Mudchute and South Quay stations and is in Travelcard Zone 2.

The Docklands Light Railway station opened as &quot;Crossharbour&quot; on 31 August 1987 on the site of the former Millwall Docks railway station, and was renamed in 1994 to &quot;Crossharbour and London Arena&quot;. Since the neighbouring London Arena has been demolished (in 2006) the original name has been reinstated. The name &quot;Crossharbour&quot; refers to the nearby Glengall Bridge across Millwall Inner Dock.

==Layout==
There are two platforms at the station with a reversing siding between the two running tracks just to the south of the station, and some trains (mainly from Stratford DLR station) used to terminate here as Lewisham DLR station was unable to handle too many trains. Nowadays however, it is rare to see trains terminate at Crossharbour, as many trains from Stratford now terminate at Canary Wharf DLR station.

The St John&#x27;s Estate is a social housing estate adjacent to the DLR station.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Crossharbour is:
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 22 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours running to and from instead of Bank.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 135, 277, D6, D8 and night route N277 serve the station.

<doc id="562941" wikidata="Q8961" url="?curid=562941" title="Spanish reconquest of New Granada">
<text>The Spanish reconquest of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] in 1815–1816 was part of the Spanish American wars of independence in South America and Colombian War of Independence. Shortly after the Napoleonic Wars ended, Ferdinand VII, recently restored to the throne in Spain, decided to send military forces to retake most of the northern South American colonies, which had established autonomous juntas and independent states. The Spanish expeditionary army under the command of Lieutenant General Pablo Morillo, with support from loyal colonial troops, completed the reconquest of New Granada by taking Bogotá on 6 May 1816.

==The expeditionary force and campaigns==
In 1814, with King Ferdinand VII back on the Spanish throne, Spain decided to send to its most seditious colonies the strongest expeditionary force that it had ever sent to the Americas, this force was known as the Expeditionary army of Costa Firme (Spanish: &quot;Ejército Expedicionario de Costa Firme&quot;). Then Field Marshall Pablo Morillo later promoted to Lieutenant General, a veteran of the Spanish struggle against the French, was chosen as its commander with Admiral Pascual Enrile as second in command and commander of the naval forces. The expeditionary force was made up of approximately 10,000 men and nearly 60 ships. Originally, they were to head for Montevideo in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, but soon it was decided to send these forces to the Viceroyalty of New Granada (present-day Colombia, Ecuador, Panama) and Venezuela.

Leaving the port of Cádiz on 17 February 1815, the force initially landed at Carupano and the island of Margarita in April, where no resistance was encountered. After leaving the island, Morillo&#x27;s troops reinforced existing royalist forces in the Venezuelan mainland, entering Cumaná and Caracas in May. A small part of the main corps set off towards Panama, while the main contingent was directed from Puerto Cabello towards the Neogranadine coastal city of Santa Marta which was still in Royalist hands.

=== Arrival in New Granada – July 1815 ===
The expeditionary forces arrived on the Neogranadine coast on 23 July, arriving in Santa Marta, there Morillo&#x27;s forces picked up supplies as well as militia volunteers. Morillo&#x27;s main objective and main effort would be concentrarted on capturing the republican fortress city of Cartagena, which was the most important port in all of the colony.

Prior to setting out for Cartagena, Morillo ordered that Brigadier Pedro Ruiz de Porras take 1,000 troops composed of the battalions &quot;Fijo de Puerto Rico&quot;, &quot;Granada&quot;, and some elements of the &quot;Albuera&quot; battalion and a squadron of hussars. This advance force would penetrate the interior of the country and capture the important river port of Mompox which lay on the Magdalena River. Another royalist force would also support Morillo&#x27;s invasion, that being 2,100 Venezuelan royalist troops of the V division under the command Colonel Sebastian de la Calzada who would invade from the east in Venezuela.

=== Siege of Cartagena ===

By mid August, Morillo and his forces set sail and arrived off Cartagena, the city was defended by some 4,000 troops under the command of General Manuel del Castillo y Rada amongst the troops were the Honor guard battalion, Militia units, as well as Venezuelan and foreign troops along with a contingent of dragoons and carabiners. There were also between 400 and 300 artillery troops to man the 400 artillery pieces that dotted the impressive fortifications that defended the city. For the next five months, the Spanish laid a brutal siege that devastated the civilian population however the defenders stubbornly held out.

By November however the siege began to take a toll on the Spanish and their expeditionary troops began to suffer from tropical diseases, as Morillo had lost his siege train equipment when the ship &quot;San Pedro&quot; blew up off the coast of Venezuela earlier that year, he began to order more offensive operations against the fortifications of the city. By early December, Morillo demanded the surrender the fortified city, at a council of war, the defenders of Cartagena decided not to capitulate, but to try to get out of the besieged city by sea and head towards Jamaica or Haiti. On the night of 5 December, the Cartagena authorities and some of the defenders set sail on ships, many of them corsairs, others merchant ships, under command of the French corsair Louis-Michel Aury. Of the nearly 2,000 people who left on 6 merchant ships and 10 armed schooners, only 600 people managed to reach Haiti. Many ships sank, ran aground or returned to port and were captured by the Spaniards. The fortified city finally fell on December 6, 1815.

=== Cachirí Campaign ===
While Cartagena was under siege, on 18 October 1815, Colonel Calzada&#x27;s V division began their invasion of New Granada setting out from the town of Guasdualito, crossing the Arauca River and penetrated the eastern llanos of the Casanare Province of New Granada. The only republican army in the vicinity was the Army of the East under the command of Colonel Joaquín Ricaurte who had at his disposal 150 infantrymen and 1,000 cavalry. Ricaurte intercepted Calzada&#x27;s forces on 31 October in an area called Chire. The republicans were victorious however Calzada&#x27;s troops were able to escape destruction as Ricaurte&#x27;s cavalry did not press their attack but instead focused on looting their defeated enemy. Despite escaping total destruction Calzada&#x27;s forces had suffered 200 dead and around 300 captured and missing as a result of the battle, nevertheless he continued his invasion pivoting northward and crossed the Cordillera Oriental of the Andes through the Chita Pass into the Tunja Province with aims of marching towards Cúcuta.

By early 1816, the combined efforts of Spanish and colonial forces, marching south from Cartagena and north from Royalist strongholds in Quito and Pasto completed the reconquest of New Granada. Colonel Sebastián de la Calzada won the Battle of Cachirí in February 1816 and took the Republican capital Bogotá on 6 May 1816. The Republican government fled to Popayán, but their last stronghold was also captured after their defeat in the Battle of Cuchilla del Tambo on 29 June 1816.

Captured units of the Republican armies of New Granada were incorporated into the Royalist army and sent to the Viceroyalty of Peru.

== Reign of Terror ==
A permanent &quot;consejo de guerra&quot; was set up to judge those accused of treason and rebellion, resulting in the execution of more than a hundred notable Republican officials, including:
*Jorge Tadeo Lozano, former president,
*Francisco José de Caldas, Colonel and Military engineer,
*Manuel de Bernardo Álvarez, former president of Cundinamarca,
*Joaquín Camacho, former member of the Triumvirate,
*Custodio García Rovira, former president,
*Liborio Mejía, former president,
*Manuel Rodríguez Torices, former member of the Triumvirate,
*Camilo Torres Tenorio, former president,
*Antonio Villavicencio, former member of the Triumvirate,
*José María García de Toledo, former president of the Junta of Cartagena de Indias
*Mercedes Abrego, for aiding Revolutionary guerrilleros,
*Policarpa Salavarrieta, for spying,
*María Antonia Santos Plata, for organizing a guerrilla group,
*, military leader,
*Manuel del Castillo y Rada, military leader,
*José María Cabal, military leader,
*Carlos de Montúfar, military leader,
*José de Ayala y Vergara, military leader.

It is estimated that in total, some 7,000 people were executed by the Spanish between 1816 and 1819.

==Patriot reactions==
On learning of the arrival of the expeditionary force, republican leaders assumed various positions. Internal divisions, which had developed during the previous years of struggle, softened but still remained a considerable obstacle. In the end, they prevented a coordinated effort by the different factions, although there were some attempts to do so, such as under the United Provinces of New Granada. One significant factor in the disunity was that representatives of the United Kingdom and of the United States refused to grant political recognition and would not commit the sufficient amount of economic and military aid to successfully resist Morillo&#x27;s force. In addition, the provinces themselves did not give each other much-needed aid. Finally, several notable individuals, whose leadership would have been useful, decided to exile themselves, although other republican leaders remained in the region and tried to reorganize their military and political activities in order to face the new threat.

As a result of the internal conflicts in New Granada, Simón Bolívar, who had been acting under the authority of the United Provinces, left his command on 8 May 1815, after failing to subdue Cartagena in March in retaliation for its refusal to give him arms and men. Bolívar traveled to Jamaica and later Haiti, a small republic that had freed itself from French rule, where he and other independence leaders were given a friendly reception. Eventually, the growing exile community received money, volunteers and weapons from Haitian president Alexandre Pétion, and resumed the struggle for independence in the remote border areas of both New Granada and Venezuela, where they established irregular guerrilla bands with the locals. This formed the basis from which the struggle to establish republics successfully spread towards the other areas of South America under Spanish control.

<doc id="562943" wikidata="Q1340669" url="?curid=562943" title="Nail clubbing">
<text>Nail clubbing, also known as digital clubbing or clubbing, is a deformity of the finger or toe nails associated with a number of diseases, anomalies and defects, some congenital, mostly of the heart and lungs. When it occurs together with joint effusions, joint pains, and abnormal skin and bone growth it is known as hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
Clubbing is associated with lung cancer, lung infections, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, or cardiovascular disease. Clubbing may also run in families, and occur unassociated with other medical problems.
Clubbing has been recognized as a sign of disease since the time of Hippocrates.

==Causes==
Clubbing is associated with
* Lung disease:
** Lung cancer
** Interstitial lung disease most commonly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
** Complicated tuberculosis
** Suppurative lung disease: lung abscess, empyema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis
** Mesothelioma of the pleura
** Sarcoidosis
* Heart disease:
** Any disease featuring chronic hypoxia
** Cyanotic heart defect (most common cardiac cause)
** Infective endocarditis
** Atrial myxoma (benign tumor)
** Arteriovenous fistula or malformation
* Gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary:
** Malabsorption
** Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis
** Cirrhosis, especially in primary biliary cholangitis
** Hepatopulmonary syndrome, a complication of cirrhosis
* Others:
** Graves&#x27; disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism) – in this case it is known as &quot;thyroid acropachy&quot;
** Familial and hereditary clubbing and &quot;pseudoclubbing&quot; (people of African descent often have what appears to be clubbing)
** Vascular anomalies of the affected arm such as an axillary artery aneurysm (in unilateral clubbing)
** Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy 

Nail clubbing is not specific to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, in patients with COPD and significant degrees of clubbing, a search for signs of bronchogenic carcinoma (or other causes of clubbing) might still be indicated. A congenital form has also been recognized.

===Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy===
A special form of clubbing is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA), known in continental Europe as Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome. This is the combination of clubbing and thickening of periosteum (connective tissue lining of the bones) and synovium (lining of joints), and is often initially diagnosed as arthritis. It is commonly associated with lung cancer.

===Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy===
Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is HPOA without signs of pulmonary disease. This form has a hereditary component, although subtle cardiac abnormalities can occasionally be found. It is known eponymously as the Touraine–Solente–Golé syndrome. This condition has been linked to mutations in the gene on the fourth chromosome (4q33-q34) coding for the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD); this leads to decreased breakdown of prostaglandin E2 and elevated levels of this substance.

==Pathogenesis==
The exact cause for sporadic clubbing is unknown. Theories as to its cause include:
* Vasodilation (i.e., distended blood vessels).
* Secretion of growth factors (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor) from the lungs.
* Overproduction of prostaglandin E2 by other tissues.
* Increased entry of megakaryocytes into the systemic circulation. Under normal circumstances in healthy individuals, megakaryocytes that arise from the bone marrow are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed and broken down before they enter the systemic circulation. It is thought that in disorders where there is right-to-left shunting or lung malignancy, the megakaryocytes can bypass the breakdown within the pulmonary circulation and enter the systemic circulation. They are then trapped within the capillary beds within the extremities, such as the digits, and release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PDGF and VEGF have growth promoting properties and cause connective tissue hypertrophy and capillary permeability.

==Diagnosis==

When clubbing is observed, pseudoclubbing should be excluded before making the diagnosis. Associated conditions may be identified by taking a detailed medical history—particular attention is paid to lung, heart, and gastrointestinal conditions—and conducting a thorough clinical examination, which may disclose associated features relevant to the underlying diagnosis. Additional studies such as a chest X-ray and a chest CT-scan may reveal otherwise asymptomatic cardiopulmonary disease.

===Stages===
Clubbing is present in one of five stages:
* No visible clubbing – Fluctuation (increased ballotability) and softening of the nail bed only. No visible changes of nails.
* Mild clubbing – Loss of the normal &lt;165° angle (Lovibond angle) between the nailbed and the fold (cuticula). Schamroth&#x27;s window (see image) is obliterated. Clubbing is not obvious at a glance.
* Moderate clubbing – Increased convexity of the nail fold. Clubbing is apparent at a glance.
* Gross clubbing – Thickening of the whole distal (end part of the) finger (resembling a drumstick)
* Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy – Shiny aspect and of the nail and skin

Schamroth&#x27;s sign or Schamroth&#x27;s window test (originally demonstrated by South African cardiologist Leo Schamroth on himself) is a popular test for clubbing. When the distal phalanges (bones nearest the fingertips) of corresponding fingers of opposite hands are directly (place fingernails of same finger on opposite hands against each other, nail to nail), a small diamond-shaped &quot;window&quot; is normally apparent between the nailbeds. If this window is obliterated, the test is positive and clubbing is present.

==Epidemiology==
The exact frequency of clubbing in the population is not known. A 2008 study found clubbing in 1%, or 15 patients, of 1511 patients admitted to a department of internal medicine in Belgium. Of these, 40%, or 6 patients, turned out to have significant underlying disease of various causes, while 60%, or 9 patients, had no medical problems on further investigations and remained well over the subsequent year.

==History==
At least since the time of Hippocrates, clubbing has been recognized as a sign of disease. The phenomenon has been called &quot;Hippocratic fingers&quot;.

The Dutch painter Dick Ket had nail clubbing as is seen from his paintings. He had an underlying disease, probably dextrocardia.

<text>Donetsk ( , ; ; ), formerly known as Aleksandrovka, Yuzivka (or Hughesovka), Stalin, and Stalino, is an industrial city in eastern Ukraine located on the Kalmius River in Donetsk Oblast, which is currently occupied by Russia as the capital of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic. The population was estimated at in the city core, with over 2 million in the metropolitan area (2011). According to the 2001 census, Donetsk was the fifth-largest city in Ukraine.

Administratively, Donetsk has been the centre of Donetsk Oblast, while historically, it is the unofficial capital and largest city of the larger economic and cultural Donets Basin (&quot;Donbas&quot;) region. Donetsk is adjacent to another major city, Makiivka, and along with other surrounding cities forms a major urban sprawl and conurbation in the region. Donetsk has been a major economic, industrial and scientific centre of Ukraine with a high concentration of heavy industries and a skilled workforce. The density of heavy industries (predominantly steel production, chemical industry, and coal mining) determined the city&#x27;s challenging ecological situation. In 2012, a UN report ranked Donetsk among the world&#x27;s fastest depopulating cities.

The original settlement in the south of the European part of the Russian Empire was first mentioned as Aleksandrovka in 1779, during the reign of the Empress Catherine the Great. In 1869, the Welsh businessman John Hughes founded a steel plant and several coal mines in the region, and the town was named Hughesovka or Yuzovka (Юзовка) in recognition of his role (&quot;Yuz&quot; being a Russian-language approximation of &quot;Hughes&quot;). During Soviet times, the city&#x27;s steel industry expanded. In 1924, Yuzovka was renamed Stalin. In 1929, Stalin was renamed Stalino, and in 1932, the city became the centre of the Donetsk region. Renamed Donetsk in 1961, the city today remains a centre for coal mining and for the steel industry.

Since April 2014, Donetsk and its surrounding areas have been one of the major sites of fighting in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, as pro-Russian separatist forces battle against Ukrainian military forces for control of the city and surrounding areas. Throughout the war, the city of Donetsk has been administered by the pro-Russian separatist forces as the center of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic (DPR), with outlying territories of the Donetsk region divided between the two sides. Donetsk International Airport became the epicenter of the war in 2014 with almost a year-long battle.
, Russia has full control of the city, with Ukrainian and Russian forces still in combat near the city.

== History ==

===Foundation===
One of the early mining settlements in the territory of Donetsk was . The existence of Aleksandrovskaya (Oleksandrivska) Cossack &quot;sloboda&quot; in its place is attested by 1779, with the eventually being opened there.

The city of Donetsk was founded in 1869 by Welsh businessman John Hughes, who operated a steel plant and several coal mines at Aleksandrovka. The worker&#x27;s settlement at the plant merged with Aleksandrovka and the place was named Yuzovo/Yuzove, later Yuzovka/Yuzivka (, ), after Hughes. In its early period, it received immigrants from Wales, especially from the town of Merthyr Tydfil. By the beginning of the 20th century, Yuzovka had approximately 50,000 inhabitants, and attained the status of a city in 1917. The main district of Yuzovka is named English Colony, and the British origin of the city is reflected in its layout and architecture.

===Soviet Union===

When the Russian Civil War broke out, Yuzivka became a part of Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic as per the Third Universal. It became a part of Cuman Zemlia, the administrative center of which was Bakhmut. During the First Ukrainian–Soviet War, Yuzivka was captured by the Bolshevik forces on 5 January 1918, but then recaptured by Ukraine in April. Soviet forces captured Yuzivka again during the Second Ukrainian–Soviet War. Donetsk became a part of Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic from its declaration of independence on 12 February 1918. The Republic was disbanded at the 2nd All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets on 20 March 1918, when the independence of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic was declared. It failed to achieve recognition, either internationally or by the Russian SFSR, and was abolished under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

In 1924, under Soviet rule, the city&#x27;s name was changed to Stalin. In that year, the city&#x27;s population totaled 63,708, and in the next year, 80,085. In 1929–31 the city&#x27;s name was changed to Stalino. The city did not have a drinking water system until 1931, when a system was laid underground. In July 1933, the city became the administrative center of the Donetsk Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1933, the first sewer system was installed, and the use of gas began the next year. Some sources state that the city was briefly called Trotsk—after Leon Trotsky—for a few months in late 1923.

At the start of World War II, the population of Stalino was 507,000. After the war, the population was 175,000. The invasion by Nazi Germany almost completely destroyed the city. It was occupied by German and Italian forces as part of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine between 16 October 1941 and 5 September 1943. It was mostly rebuilt on a large scale after the war.

In 1945, young men and women aged 17 to 35, from the Danube Swabian &quot;(Schwowe)&quot; communities of Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania (the Batschka and Banat), were forcibly sent to Russia as Allied &quot;war reparations&quot;, being put to work as slave labour to rebuild Stalino and to work in its mines. The conditions were so poor that many died from disease and malnutrition.

During Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s second wave of destalinization in November 1961, the city was renamed Donetsk, after the Seversky Donets River, a tributary of the Don in order to distance it from the former leader Joseph Stalin.

In 1965, the Donetsk Academy of Sciences was established as part of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR.

===Independent Ukraine===
After the declaration of independence made by the Ukrainian parliament on 24 August 1991 the 1991 Ukrainian independence referendum was held on 1 December 1991. In this referendum 83.90% of Donetsk&#x27;s voters voted in favour of independence.

After experiencing a tough time in the 1990s, when it was the center of gang wars for control over industrial enterprises, Donetsk modernised quickly, largely under the influence of big companies.

In 1994 a consultative referendum was held in Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast, with around 90% supporting recognition of Russian as an official language alongside Ukrainian, and for Russian to be an official language on a regional level.

In the 1990s and the 2000s, hundreds were killed in coal mine collapses in Donetsk and the region. These included the 2008 Ukraine coal mine collapse, the 2007 Zasyadko mine disaster, and the 2015 Zasyadko mine disaster. Ukraine has had many mining accidents since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, with one reason cited as the linking of miners&#x27; pay to production, which is an incentive to ignore safety procedures that slow production.

In a summit in Moscow in 2008, Donetsk was recognised as the best city in the Commonwealth of Independent States for its implemented development strategies; in 2012 and 2013 Donetsk was recognised as the best place for business in Ukraine.

Whilst getting praise for its business potential in 2009, Donetsk also received criticism for the strong mafia connection of its growing oligarchy, and for an increasing poverty rate. Some analysts warned of a long-term collapse of the Donetsk economy; and that it could share Detroit&#x27;s gloomy fate, due to its failure to combat crime and poverty.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
After President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine to seek asylum in Russia, Russian-backed separatists took over the Regional State Administration Building, the main government building, in Donetsk. The police did not offer resistance. Later in the week the authorities of Donetsk disallowed a referendum on the status of the region and the police retook the Donetsk OSA building. Donetsk became one of the centers of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine.
On 7 April 2014, pro-Russian activists seized control of Donetsk OSA and declared the &quot;Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic&quot;, asking for Russian intervention.

On 11 May 2014, a referendum on the self-rule was held in Donetsk. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic election commission, Roman Lyagin, said that almost 90 percent of those who voted in the Donetsk Region endorsed political independence from Kyiv. Ukraine does not recognize the referendum, while the EU and US stated that the polls were illegal.

Heavy shelling by the Ukrainian Army and paramilitary units have caused civilian fatalities in Donetsk. Human Rights Watch has called on both warring factions to cease using the unguided BM-21 Grad missiles in populated areas, and has said the use of these weapons systems was a violation of international humanitarian laws and could constitute a war crime. It also called on the insurgents to avoid their deployment in densely populated areas.

The 2015 IIHF World Championship Division I, Group A was scheduled for 18 to 24 April 2015 in Donetsk, but Ukraine withdrew as hosts due to the ongoing conflict in the country. Instead of Donetsk, the tournament was organized in Kraków, Poland. Eventually, Ukraine co-organized 2017 IIHF World Championship Division I, again Group A, but in its capital, Kyiv.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the area around Donetsk has seen full-scale fighting between Ukrainian forces against Russian forces and their DNR counterparts. Russian-installed local officials have repeatedly accused Ukrainian armed forces of shelling Donetsk. On 30 September 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree claiming to annex four regions, including Donetsk, as part of Russia. This annexation has been seen by the global community as a breach of international law.

== Geography ==
Donetsk lies in the steppe landscape, surrounded by scattered woodland, hills, spoil tips, rivers and lakes. The northern outskirts are mainly used for agriculture. The Kalmius River links the city with the Sea of Azov, which is to the south, and a popular recreational area for those living in Donetsk. A wide belt of farmlands surrounds the city.

The city stretches from north to south and from east to west. There are 2 nearby reservoirs: Nyzhnekalmius (60 ha), and the Donetsk Sea (206 ha). 5 rivers flow through the city, including the Kalmius, Asmolivka (13 km), Cherepashkyna (23 km), Skomoroshka and Bakhmutka. The city also contains a total of 125 spoil tips.

== Government and administrative divisions ==


Starting on 7 April 2014, Donetsk was &quot;de facto&quot; governed by the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic as its capital city. The Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic was at that time not recognized internationally, and all UN member states recognized the city as Ukrainian. However, in February 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and the neighboring Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic as sovereign states, and later that year officially annexed them (along with various other parts of Ukraine that were then at least partially under Russian military occupation). The member states of the United Nations still overwhelmingly considered the areas to be Ukrainian, with only Syria, North Korea, and Russia itself considering them to be Russian.

The territory of Donetsk is divided into 9 administrative districts, whose local government is administered by &quot;district councils&quot;, which are subordinate to the Donetsk City Council.

The RSK Olimpiyskyi Stadium was chosen as a reserve stadium.

Donetsk, together with the nearby Mariupol, were the host towns of the 2009 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. The stadiums hosting the event on behalf of Donetsk were RSC Olimpiyskiy (which hosted the final) and the Metalurh Stadium.

==== Forged Figures Park ====
Forged Figures Park was opened in 2001. The International Smithcraft Festival takes place in the park every year. Some prize-winning works are gifted to the city and remain in the park, periodically increasing the number of sculptures.

==== Aqua park ====
Donetsk Aquapark &quot;Royal Marine&quot; was opened in Scherbakova Park in late 2012. The free-standing dome, made with an aluminum truss structure, is high with a diameter of , and features a retractable design that slides open to reveal up to 50% of the structure to sunlight. The aqua park, one of the largest indoor water parks in the world, was built by Canadian company OpenAire, Inc.

=== Architecture ===
Donetsk, at the time &quot;Yuzovka&quot;, was divided into two parts: north and south. In the southern part were the city&#x27;s factories, railway stations, telegraph buildings, hospitals and schools. Not far from the factories was the &quot;English colony&quot; where the engineers and the management lived. After the construction of the residence of John Hughes and the various complexes for the foreign workers, the city&#x27;s southern portion was constructed mainly in the English style. 

These buildings used rectangular and triangular shaped façades, green rooftops, large windows, which occupied a large portion of the building, and balconies. In this part of the town, the streets were large and had pavements. A major influence on the formation of architecture in Donetsk was the &quot;official architect&quot; of a Novorossiya company — &quot;Moldingauyer&quot;. Preserved buildings of the southern part of Yuzovka consisted of the residences of John Hughes (&quot;1891, partially preserved&quot;), Bolfur (&quot;1889&quot;) and Bosse.

In the northern part of Yuzovka, &quot;Novyi Svet&quot;, lived traders, craftsmen and bureaucrats. Here were located the market hall, the police headquarters and the Transfiguration Cathedral. The central street of Novyi Svet and the neighbouring streets were mainly edged by one- or two-story residential buildings, as well as markets, restaurants, hotels, offices and banks. A famous preserved building in the northern part of Yuzovka was the Hotel Great Britain.

The first general plan of Stalino was made in 1932 in Odesa by the architect P. Golovchenko. In 1937, the project was partly reworked. These projects were the first in the city&#x27;s construction bureau&#x27;s history.

A large portion of the city&#x27;s buildings from the second half of the 20th century were designed by the architect Pavel Vigdergauz, which was given the Government award of the USSR for architecture in the city of Donetsk in 1978.

=== Religion ===
Donetsk&#x27;s residents belong to religious traditions including the Eastern Orthodox Church Eastern Catholic Churches, Protestantism, and the Roman Catholic Church, as well as Islam and Judaism. The religious body with the most members is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) and Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate.

In 2014, a leaflet carrying the signature of the &quot;Chairman of Donetsk&#x27;s temporary government Denis Pushilin&quot; was distributed to Jews on the festival of Passover. The leaflet asked Donetsk&#x27;s Jewish citizens to register themselves, their property, and their families to the pro-Russian authorities. The leaflet claimed that failure to comply with its demands would result in the revocation of citizenship and confiscation of property. The leaflet prompted confusion and fear among Donetsk&#x27;s Jewish population, who saw echoes of the Holocaust in the leaflet. Pushilin denied any connection with the leaflets and called them a provocation.

=== Media ===
Five television stations operate within Donetsk:

* TRK Ukraina ()
* KRT, Kyivska Rus&#x27; ()
* First Municipal ()
* Kanal 27 ()
* TRK Donbass ()

In Donetsk, there is the 360-metre tall TV tower, one of the tallest structures in the city, completed in 1992.

== Museums ==

Donetsk is home to about 140 museums. Among them, two large regional museums – Donetsk Region History Museum and Donetsk Regional Art Museum.

Donetsk Region History Museum reveals the city&#x27;s true identity and covers to the entire local community, diverse as it is. Set up in 1924, it offers an extensive expo with 120,000 exhibits: from archeological findings dating back to pre-historic times to the founding of the city by John Hughes, development of industry and coal mining, World War II and the Soviet times. On 21 August 2014, the mayor of Donetsk reported that the roof and walls of the Donetsk Regional History Museum had been destroyed by shellfire early that morning.

FC Shaktar Museum was opened in 2010. This museum was the first Ukrainian museum to be nominated for a European Museum of the Year Award.

== Transport ==

=== Local transport ===

The main forms of transport within Donetsk are: trams, electric trolley buses, buses and marshrutkas (private minibusses). The city&#x27;s public transport system is controlled by the united &quot;Dongorpastrans&quot; municipal company. The city has 12 tram lines (~130 km), 17 trolley bus lines (~188 km), and about 115 bus lines. Both the tram and trolley bus systems in the city are served by 2 depots each. Another method of transport within the city is taxicab service, of which there are 32 in Donetsk.

The city also contains railway stations located within the city and its suburbs: railway station &quot;Yuzhny&quot; (South), which serves mainly transport lines to the south, hence its name; railway station &quot;Tsentr&quot; (Centre), which serves transport in the direction of Marinka and Vuhledar as well as intercity transport; the railway station &quot;Krytyi rynok&quot; (Indoor market), which serves mainly transport in the north and east directions; and the railway station &quot;Putilovsky&quot;, which serves mainly the north and northwest transport directions.

The construction of the metro system in the city, begun in 1992, was abandoned in 2012 due to the lack of funding. No lines or stations have been finished.

=== Railways ===
Donetsk&#x27;s main railway station, which at the beginning of the 21st century served about 7 million passengers annually, is located in the northern part of the city. There is a museum near the main station, dealing with the history of the region&#x27;s railways. Other railway stations are: &quot;Rutchenkovo&quot;, located in the Kyivskyi District; &quot;Mandrykino&quot; (Petrovskyi District), and &quot;Mushketovo&quot; (Budionnivskyi District). Some passenger trains avoid Donetsk station and serve the Yasynuvata station, located outside the city limits. Although not used for regular transport, the city also has a children&#x27;s railway. As of September 2009, a new railway terminal facility to comply with UEFA requirements (since Donetsk was one of the host cities for UEFA EURO 2012) was planned.

The Donetsk Oblast was an important transport hub in Ukraine, so was its centre Donetsk. The &quot;Donetsk Railways&quot;, based in Donetsk, was the largest railway division in the region.

=== Road transport ===
The highway, part of the International E-road network, runs through the city &quot;en route&quot; to Rostov-on-Don in Russia.

In addition, another international road runs through the city: the M 04. Also, three national Ukrainian roads (N 15, N 20, and N 21) pass through the city.

The construction of the fourth stage of a circular road bypassing Donetsk was to be completed in 2014.

=== Air travel ===
In addition to public and rail transport, Donetsk used to have an international airport. It was constructed during the early 1940s and early 1950s. It was rebuilt in 1973 and again from 2011 to 2012. Because of fighting the airport has been closed as of 26 May 2014 and the airport has since then largely been destroyed. The airspace above Donetsk has also been closed since the MH17 disaster.

== Education ==

Donetsk has several universities, which include five state universities, 11 institutes, three academies, 14 tekhnikums, five private universities, and six colleges.

The most important and prominent educational institutions include Donetsk National Technical University, founded in 1921 (&quot;Donetsk Polytechnical Institute&quot; in 1960–1993), as well as the Donetsk National University which was founded in 1937. The National Technical University held close contacts with the university in Magdeburg. Since 1970, more than 100 students from Germany (&quot;East Germany&quot;) have completed their higher education at either one of the two main universities in Donetsk. Donetsk is also the home of the Donetsk National Medical University, which was founded in 1930 and became one of the largest medical universities in the Soviet Union. There are also several scientific research institutes and an Islamic University within Donetsk.

Donetsk is also the home of the Prokofiev Donetsk State Music Academy, a music conservatory founded in 1960.

<doc id="562954" wikidata="Q594244" url="?curid=562954" title="Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)">
<text>Mirage is the thirteenth studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 2 July 1982 by Warner Bros. Records. This studio effort&#x27;s soft rock sound stood in stark contrast to its more experimental predecessor, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Tusk&quot;. &quot;Mirage&quot; yielded several singles: &quot;Hold Me&quot; (which peaked at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Chart, remaining there for seven weeks), &quot;Gypsy&quot; (number 12 US Pop Chart), &quot;Love in Store&quot; (number 22 US Pop Chart), &quot;Oh Diane&quot; (number nine in the UK), and &quot;Can&#x27;t Go Back&quot; (number 83 in the UK).

==Background==
After the completion of the worldwide Tusk Tour, the band took a year-long hiatus. During this time, Stevie Nicks, Mick Fleetwood, and Lindsey Buckingham had each started solo careers, with Nicks achieving a multi-platinum, number-one success with 1981&#x27;s &quot;Bella Donna&quot;. Ken Caillat, who reprised his role as producer after working with the band on &quot;Rumours&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot;, remembered that there was a sense of rivalry between Nicks and Buckingham over the commercial trajectory of their solo careers.

Unlike the band&#x27;s previous four albums, Fleetwood wanted the band to record &quot;Mirage&quot; outside of Los Angeles; he also sought to eschew the experimentation found on &quot;Tusk&quot; and instead replicate the commercial appeal of &quot;Rumours&quot;. To achieve this, Caillat scouted for potential studios and came across Le Château in Hérouville, France. The band agreed to record at the facility, although Caillat said that certain members, particularly Nicks and Buckingham, were difficult to work with. The band hired a chef to cook meals for them, but Caillat said that Buckingham and Nicks would complain about the food and the lack of television. In an attempt to appease them, Caillat brought the two video machines with baseball games taped by one of his friends in Los Angeles.

==Recording and composition==
In a 1981 interview with &quot;BAM&quot; magazine, Nicks reported that her original three submissions for &quot;Mirage&quot; were &quot;That&#x27;s Alright&quot; (with the working title &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;), &quot;If You Were My Love&quot;, and &quot;Smile at You&quot;, although she said that Buckingham encouraged her to replace the latter song with a different composition. Nicks agreed with Buckingham, stating that &quot;It&#x27;s kind of a bitter song and that&#x27;s really not where any of us are at right now, even though it&#x27;s a wonderful song. My songs don&#x27;t take long to record, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&quot; &quot;Smile at You&quot; later appeared on Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;Say You Will&quot;.

The Nicks-penned &quot;Gypsy&quot; was the second single from the album and was accompanied by a video directed by Russell Mulcahy. Nicks wrote &quot;Gypsy&quot; in 1979 and considered it for her &quot;Bella Donna&quot; solo album, but she ultimately saved it for &quot;Mirage&quot;. Of the other two compositions from Nicks on the album, &quot;That&#x27;s Alright&quot;, which was one of the three songs she originally submitted for inclusion on &quot;Mirage&quot;, dated back to the Buckingham Nicks days of 1974, while &quot;Straight Back&quot; was written in the winter of 1981. &quot;Straight Back&quot; referred to her separation from then-lover, producer Jimmy Iovine and the disruption she experienced to her newly established solo career in order to rejoin Fleetwood Mac for the 1982 project.

Of Christine McVie&#x27;s four compositions, three were written in collaboration with other writers: &quot;Love in Store&quot; with Jim Recor, ex-husband of Nicks&#x27; friend Sara Recor who later married Mick Fleetwood, &quot;Hold Me&quot; with singer-songwriter Robbie Patton whose second album she had recently produced and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; with lyrics from erstwhile John Mayall drummer Colin Allen. The other, &quot;Only Over You&quot;, was credited &quot;With thanks to Dennis Wilson for inspiration.&quot; McVie had recently ended her relationship with Wilson, a member of the Beach Boys, who would die by drowning the following year.

Three of Lindsey Buckingham&#x27;s five contributions were written with co-producer Richard Dashut including the UK top-10 single &quot;Oh Diane&quot;. Buckingham entered the studio with &quot;Can&#x27;t Go Back&quot; and &quot;Eyes of the World&quot;, while his other three songs on the album were written shortly after his arrival in France. On &quot;Empire State&quot;, Buckingham played a 19th century lap harp given to him by Mick Fleetwood. On &quot;Book of Love&quot;, Buckingham sang all of the parts on the chorus and experimented with the tape speeds to achieve different vocal timbres. McVie remembered that Buckingham overdubbed some of the song&#x27;s vocals to a slowed-down recording and later sped it up, with the end result resembling Nicks&#x27; voice.

Buckingham assembled &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; in a piecemeal manner starting with a series of chords. He then spliced together additional musical passages, including the chord progression of Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon and the acoustic guitar part from an instrumental composition on &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot;. In a 1981 interview with &quot;Record World&quot;, Buckingham said that there was an uptempo track on &quot;Mirage&quot; that he originally planned to include on his &quot;Law and Order&quot; solo album, but he rationalised that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t just save the best stuff&quot; for &quot;Law and Order&quot; and thought that &quot;anything that seemed particularly suited for Fleetwood Mac should be used.&quot; He described the song as a cross between &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; and &quot;Second Hand News&quot;.

After the initial recording sessions at Château D&#x27;Hérouville, the band finished the album in California. Nicks said that the band attempted to complete the album in multiple Los Angeles recording studios, but she was unsure how much work was conducted after they left Château D&#x27;Hérouville. Caillat stated in a 1982 interview that Nicks&#x27; involvement with &quot;Mirage&quot; was largely limited to the initial recording sessions at Château D&#x27;Hérouville and said that she spent between ten and fifteen days at various Los Angeles studios for further overdubs. Most of the recording sessions were attended by Caillat, Dashut, Buckingham, Fleetwood, and Christine McVie. Buckingham said that Fleetwood would provide feedback to the proceedings when he identified problems with the mix.

==Critical reception==
In&quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, Ken Emerson wrote that &quot;For all its pleasant tunefulness, &quot;Mirage&quot; (Warner Bros.) is not a retreat to the tried-and-true pop format of &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; and &quot;Rumours&quot;. Neither, despite its avante-garde oddities, does it surrender to the incoherence of &quot;Tusk&quot;. Rather, it’s a winning synthesis of the best of both worlds. ... &quot;Mirage&quot; represents yet another metamorphosis; certainly Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s most delightful album, it may also be the most rewarding.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; commended the efforts of all three songwriters for &quot;contributing their strongest songs yet.&quot; They said that the album demonstrated Buckingham&#x27;s capabilities as an arranger, particularly in regards to the vocal harmonies, which they felt were evocative of the Beach Boys&#x27; best work.

The album returned the group to the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for the first time since their 1977 album &quot;Rumours&quot;, spending five weeks at number one. It spent a total of 18 weeks in the US top ten and has been certified double platinum for shipments in excess of two million copies in the US. It also reached number five in the UK where it has been certified platinum for shipping 300,000 copies, and number two in Australia.

== Mirage Tour video ==
Two of the final shows of the &quot;Mirage&quot; tour were filmed in Los Angeles in 1982. Originally released on VHS and CED videodisc in 1983, many tracks were edited out, with the loss of &quot;Second Hand News&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Brown Eyes&quot;, &quot;Oh Well&quot;, &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot;, &quot;Sara&quot;, and &quot;Hold Me&quot;, reducing the 135 minute show to just 80 minutes on cassette. Three of these tracks, &quot;Second Hand News,&quot; &quot;Brown Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Hold Me&quot; would later be officially released on the expanded 1980 Fleetwood Mac &quot;Live&quot; album in 2021. The running order was also completely rearranged so that Nicks&#x27; &quot;Gypsy&quot; followed &quot;The Chain&quot;, whilst &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot; and &quot;Blue Letter&quot; were moved to the first half of the edited show.

In 2006 a better quality release was issued in Australia, with an added special feature comprising six Stevie Nicks solo promotional videos for some of her singles released between 1981 and 1986. This collection had previously been issued separately on VHS in 1986 under the title &quot;Stevie Nicks – I Can&#x27;t Wait&quot;, and exclusively includes a live solo version of her top ten hit &quot;Leather and Lace&quot; (a duet with Don Henley), which was recorded on the final night of Nicks&#x27; 1981 &quot;Bella Donna&quot; tour. The clip was not included in the 9-track edit of Nicks&#x27; &quot;White Wing Dove&quot; live concert VHS release in 1982, and neither was it included in the DVD supplement to her 2008 retrospective &quot;Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks&quot;. To date, this is the only DVD availability of this live performance.

In 2009, another DVD incarnation of the &quot;Mirage&quot; concert was released under the title &quot;Fleetwood Mac – In Performance&quot; by the Showline label on a region-free disc. 

An album of recordings culled from Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s October 1982 performance at The Forum was released in 2024 under the title &quot;Mirage Tour &#x27;82&quot;. The collection contained 22 tracks, of which six had been previously unreleased.

== Deluxe edition ==
A deluxe edition of &quot;Mirage&quot; was released on 23 September 2016. This expanded reissue features a remaster of the original album, 13 live tracks, B-sides, outtakes, plus other songs that did not make the final cut. Some of these songs include &quot;Goodbye Angel&quot; and &quot;Teen Beat&quot;, which were both released on &quot;25 Years: The Chain&quot;, and &quot;Smile at You&quot;, later released on &quot;Say You Will&quot;. and &quot;If You Were My Love&quot; later released on Stevie Nicks&#x27; solo album &quot;24 Karat Gold: Songs From The Vault&quot;. The DVD-Audio disc contains both the 5.1 Surround and 24/96 Stereo Audio mixes of the original album.

<doc id="562955" wikidata="Q1397640" url="?curid=562955" title="Albert B. Fall">
<text>Albert Bacon Fall (November 26, 1861November 30, 1944) was a United States senator from New Mexico and Secretary of the Interior under President Warren G. Harding who became infamous for his involvement in the Teapot Dome scandal; he was the only person convicted as a result of the affair. As a captain in the United States Army, he supported a military invasion of Mexico in 1916 as a means of ending Pancho Villa&#x27;s raids.

==Early life and family==
Albert Fall was born in Frankfort, Kentucky, to William R. and Edmonia Taylor Fall. He attended schools as a child in Nashville, Tennessee, but was primarily self-educated. By age eleven Fall was employed in a cotton factory. This is most likely the cause of respiratory health problems he suffered throughout his life. Due to his illnesses, Fall moved west as a young man to seek a better climate. He tried Oklahoma and Texas, but eventually he settled in Las Cruces, New Mexico Territory, where he practiced law.

Between 1879 and 1881, Fall worked as a teacher while he studied law. On May 7, 1883, he married Emma Garland Morgan in Clarksville, Texas. They had four children: a son, Jack Morgan Fall, and daughters Alexina Chase, Caroline Everhart and Jouett Elliott. Jack and Caroline died within a week of each other during the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic. The Fall family lived at the Three Rivers Ranch in the Tularosa Basin. Fall also had a home in El Paso.

==Career==
Fall was admitted to the bar in 1891. He served in the New Mexico House of Representatives from 1891 to 1892, and served on the territorial council from 1892 until 1893. Fall was appointed judge of the third judicial district in 1893, and associate justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court later the same year. Fall served on the Territorial Council again from 1896 to 1897, and as the territory&#x27;s attorney general in 1897. He again served on the Territorial Council from 1902 to 1904.

During the Spanish–American War, Fall served as captain of an infantry company. He served as attorney general again in 1907. In 1910 he was a delegate to the territory&#x27;s constitutional convention.

===Albert Jennings Fountain murder case===
Fall and his neighbor, Oliver M. Lee, were landowners in the area and were rivals to attorney Albert Jennings Fountain. Fall&#x27;s association with Lee seems to have begun when Fall helped Lee in a criminal case. Lee, known for dispensing violence and terrorizing his enemies, employed William McNew and Jim Gilliland, both known as gunmen. Lee repeatedly rustled cattle from other ranches in the area, altering the brands to resemble his own. Fall&#x27;s legal services ensured Lee and his men stayed free from criminal conviction; when they were arrested, Fall intervened on their behalf.

Fall disliked Fountain, who showed little fear of the Fall–Lee faction and challenged them openly in the courts and political arena. On February 1, 1896, Fountain and his eight-year-old son, Henry, disappeared near White Sands on the way from Fall&#x27;s Three Rivers Ranch north of Tularosa to their home in Mesilla. Fall successfully defended Lee, McNew, and Gilliland when they were put on trial for Henry&#x27;s murder in Hillsboro.

Evidence at the trial suggested Lee was involved in Fountain&#x27;s murder and disappearance, but investigators had to deal with a corrupt court system and Fall&#x27;s legal skill. The bodies of Fountain and his son and their horse were never found, which hampered the prosecution. The charges against McNew were dismissed by the court, while Lee and Gilliland were acquitted.

===Pat Garrett case===
In 1908, Fall successfully defended Jesse Wayne Brazel, the accused killer of former Sheriff Pat Garrett. Garrett, famous for killing outlaw Billy the Kid in 1881, had pursued the suspects in the Fountain murders.

===Election to the Senate===
As a member of the Republican Party, Fall was elected as one of the first U.S. Senators from New Mexico in 1912. It was widely known that he made a political alliance with Thomas B. Catron, the man who served alongside him, to ensure that both would be elected. This controversy made Fall a target of the local Republican Party, as they believed he had not contributed sufficiently to their efforts to secure New Mexico&#x27;s statehood, and was not worthy of their nomination. The selection of Catron and Fall also disappointed Hispanics, who had hoped that one of their own would be selected. Fall was also severely disliked by Democrats.

Fall&#x27;s unpopularity came to a head when, under Senate rules, his term ended in March 1913 and his name was put up again before the legislature for re-election. After various votes, the legislature re-elected Fall. However, Governor McDonald, on the advice of his Democratic legal advisor, Summers Burkhart, asserted that the legislature&#x27;s procedure had been illegal and failed to sign the credentialing papers in an attempt to oust Fall by forcing a special session of the legislature and a new vote. The attempt failed; Fall won the special legislative election. When re-election came up in 1918, Fall was ambivalent about running, but nonetheless accepted the Republican nomination. In the general election he overcame a bitter challenge from Democrat William B. Walton, even though Fall never made a campaign speech. Some commentators suggest that it was sympathy for Fall&#x27;s tragic loss of his two children in the flu pandemic that won him the election.

In the Senate, Fall served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Commerce and Labor, was noted for his support of the suffrage movement and his extreme isolationist tendencies when the U.S. entered World War I. As a leading antagonist to President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, Fall was permitted to visit the stricken President in his White House bedroom in October 1919, hoping to gauge whether the Chief Executive was well enough to remain in office. &quot;I have been praying for you, Sir,&quot; Fall sought to offer sincerely. &quot;Which way, Senator?&quot; Wilson replied, drawing laughter from his rival.

In the Senate, Fall become close friends with the people who would later make up the infamous Ohio Gang, which secured him a cabinet position in Warren G. Harding&#x27;s administration in March 1921. While local politicians opposed him, his popularity with the residents of New Mexico was reportedly very high.

===Teapot Dome scandal===

Fall was appointed to the position of Secretary of the Interior by President Warren G. Harding in March 1921. Soon after his appointment, Harding convinced Edwin Denby, the Secretary of the Navy, that Fall&#x27;s department should take over responsibility for the Naval Reserves at both Elk Hills and Buena Vista, California, and Teapot Dome, Wyoming. This last setting became the namesake of the scandal to erupt in April 1922, when &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Secretary Fall had decided that two of his friends, oilmen Harry F. Sinclair (Mammoth Oil Corporation) and Edward L. Doheny (Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company), should be given leases to drill in parts of these Naval Reserves without open bidding. In exchange, Fall accepted bribes.

The investigation found Fall guilty of bribery and conspiracy on October 24, 1929 (exactly the same day as the Black Thursday) as a result of $385,000 having been paid to him by Edward L. Doheny. Fall was jailed for one year as a result—the first former cabinet officer sentenced to prison as a result of misconduct in office. Doheny was not only acquitted on the charge of bribing Fall, but Doheny&#x27;s corporation foreclosed on Fall&#x27;s ranch in Tularosa Basin, New Mexico, because of &quot;unpaid loans&quot; which turned out to be that same bribe. Sinclair was fined and served six months for Contempt of Congress.

After serving time in prison, Fall was in financially reduced circumstances. He and his wife lived in El Paso, Texas. Fall died there on November 30, 1944, after a long illness. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in El Paso.

The epithet &quot;fall guy&quot; has been said to derive from his surname, but this phrase was in use well before the scandal.

<text>Philippe Legrain is a British political economist and writer. He specializes in global and European economic issues, notably globalisation, migration, the post-crisis world and the euro. A visiting senior fellow at the London School of Economics&#x27; European Institute, he is a former adviser to European Commission president José Manuel Barroso from 2011 to 2014.

== Early life and background ==
Legrain was born in 1973. His father is French and his mother Estonian. They met in New York and married in 1969. They moved to London where Philippe was born and he considers himself British &quot;though cosmopolitan in outlook&quot;.

== Career ==
Legrain is the author of four books: &quot;Open World: The Truth about Globalisation&quot;, which is a counter-argument to Naomi Klein&#x27;s &quot;No Logo&quot;; &quot;Immigrants: Your Country Needs Them&quot; was shortlisted for the 2007 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award; &quot;Aftershock: Reshaping the World Economy After the Crisis&quot;; and &quot;European Spring: Why Our Economies and Politics are in a Mess – and How to Put Them Right&quot;, which the Financial Times calls &quot;essential reading&quot;.

From February 2011 to February 2014, he was principal adviser and head of the analysis team at the Bureau of European Policy Advisers to the president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso. As such, he provided President Barroso with independent economic advice and led the team which provides him with strategic policy advice.

Before that, Legrain was a visiting fellow at the European Institute of the London School of Economics, a senior fellow at the Lisbon Council for Economic Competitiveness and Social Renewal and a contributing editor to &quot;Prospect magazine&quot;. A commentator for BBC TV and radio, he has written for various newspapers and magazines, including the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, the &quot;Wall Street Journal Europe&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. He is an advocate of freer international migration, globalisation, the euro and a land value tax.

Legrain has also been trade and economics correspondent for &quot;The Economist&quot;, special adviser to WTO director-general Mike Moore, and chief economist and director of policy for the pro-European pressure group, Britain in Europe.

He holds a BSc in economics and an MSc in politics of the world economy, both from the London School of Economics.

<doc id="562958" wikidata="Q112965645" url="?curid=562958" title="Signs and symptoms">
<text>Signs and symptoms are diagnostic indications of an illness, injury, or condition.

Signs are objective and externally observable; symptoms are a person&#x27;s reported subjective experiences.

A sign for example may be a higher or lower temperature than normal, raised or lowered blood pressure or an abnormality showing on a medical scan. A symptom is something out of the ordinary that is experienced by an individual such as feeling feverish, a headache or other pains in the body, which occur as the body&#x27;s immune system fights off an infection.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Signs===
A medical sign is an objective observable indication of a disease, injury, or medical condition that may be detected during a physical examination. These signs may be visible, such as a rash or bruise, or otherwise detectable such as by using a stethoscope or taking blood pressure. Medical signs, along with symptoms, help in forming a diagnosis. Some examples of signs are nail clubbing of either the fingernails or toenails or an abnormal gait.

===Symptoms===
A symptom is something felt or experienced, such as pain or dizziness. Signs and symptoms are not mutually exclusive, for example a subjective feeling of fever can be noted as sign by using a thermometer that registers a high reading. The CDC lists various diseases by their signs and symptoms such as for measles which includes a high fever, conjunctivitis, and cough, followed a few days later by the measles rash.

===Cardinal signs and symptoms===
Cardinal signs and symptoms are very specific even to the point of being pathognomonic. A cardinal sign or cardinal symptom can also refer to the major sign or symptom of a disease. Abnormal reflexes can indicate problems with the nervous system. Signs and symptoms are also applied to physiological states outside the context of disease, as for example when referring to the signs and symptoms of pregnancy, or the symptoms of dehydration. Sometimes a disease may be present without showing any signs or symptoms when it is known as being asymptomatic. The disorder may be discovered through tests including scans. An infection may be asymptomatic but still be transmissible.

===Syndrome===

Signs and symptoms are often non-specific, but some combinations can be suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. A particular set of characteristic signs and symptoms that may be associated with a disorder is known as a syndrome.

==Related terms==
===Symptomatic===
When a disease is evidenced by symptoms it is known as symptomatic. There are many conditions including subclinical infections that display no symptoms, and these are termed asymptomatic. 

Signs and symptoms may be mild or severe, brief or longer-lasting when they may become reduced (remission), or then recur (relapse or recrudescence) known as a flare-up. A flare-up may show more severe symptoms.

The term chief complaint, also &quot;presenting problem&quot;, is used to describe the initial concern of an individual when seeking medical help, and once this is clearly noted a history of the present illness may be taken. The symptom that ultimately leads to a diagnosis is called a cardinal symptom. Some symptoms can be misleading as a result of referred pain, where for example a pain in the right shoulder may be due to an inflamed gallbladder and not to presumed muscle strain.

===Prodrome===
Many diseases have an early prodromal stage where a few signs and symptoms may suggest the presence of a disorder before further specific symptoms may emerge. Measles for example has a prodromal presentation that includes a hacking cough, fever, and Koplik&#x27;s spots in the mouth. Over half of migraine episodes have a prodromal phase. Schizophrenia has a notable prodromal stage, as has dementia.

===Nonspecific symptoms===
Some symptoms are &quot;specific&quot;, that is, they are associated with a single, specific medical condition.

&quot;Nonspecific symptoms&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;equivocal symptoms&quot;, are not specific to a particular condition. They include unexplained weight loss, headache, pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, night sweats, and malaise. A group of three particular nonspecific symptoms – fever, night sweats, and weight loss – over a period of six months are termed B symptoms associated with lymphoma and indicate a poor prognosis.

Other sub-types of symptoms include:
* &quot;constitutional&quot; or &quot;general symptoms&quot;, which affect general well-being or the whole body, such as a fever;
* &quot;concomitant symptoms&quot;, which are symptoms that occur at the same time as the primary symptom;
* &quot;prodromal symptoms&quot;, which are the first symptoms of an bigger set of problems;
* &quot;delayed symptoms&quot;, which happen some time after the trigger; and
* &quot;objective symptoms&quot;, which are symptoms whose existence can be observed and confirmed by a healthcare provider.

===Vital signs===
Vital signs are the four signs that can give an immediate measurement of the body&#x27;s overall functioning and health status. They are temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The ranges of these measurements vary with age, weight, gender and with general health.

A digital application has been developed for use in clinical settings that measures three of the vital signs (not temperature) using just a smartphone, and has been approved by NHS England. The application is registered as &quot;Lifelight First&quot;, and &quot;Lifelight Home&quot; is under development (2020) for monitoring-use by people at home using just the camera on their smartphone or tablet. This will additionally measure oxygen saturation and atrial fibrillation. Other devices are then not needed.

===Syndromes===

Many conditions are indicated by a group of known signs, or signs and symptoms. These can be a group of three known as a triad; a group of four (&quot;tetrad&quot;); or a group of five (&quot;pentad&quot;).

An example of a triad is Meltzer&#x27;s triad presenting purpura a rash, arthralgia painful joints, and myalgia painful and weak muscles. Meltzer&#x27;s triad indicates the condition cryoglobulinemia. Huntington&#x27;s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by a triad of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric signs and symptoms. A large number of these groups that can be characteristic of a particular disease are known as a syndrome. Noonan syndrome for example, has a diagnostic set of unique facial and musculoskeletal features. Some syndromes such as nephrotic syndrome may have a number of underlying causes that are all related to diseases that affect the kidneys.

Sometimes a child or young adult may have symptoms suggestive of a genetic disorder that cannot be identified even after genetic testing. In such cases the term SWAN (syndrome without a name) may be used. Often a diagnosis may be made at some future point when other more specific symptoms emerge but many cases may remain undiagnosed. The inability to diagnose may be due to a unique combination of symptoms or an overlap of conditions, or to the symptoms being atypical of a known disorder, or to the disorder being extremely rare.

It is possible that a person with a particular syndrome might not display every single one of the signs and/or symptoms that compose/define a syndrome.

===Positive and negative===
Sensory symptoms can also be described as positive symptoms, or as negative symptoms depending on whether the symptom is abnormally present such as tingling or itchiness, or abnormally absent such as loss of smell. The following terms are used for negative symptoms – hypoesthesia is a partial loss of sensitivity to moderate stimuli, such as pressure, touch, warmth, cold. Anesthesia is the complete loss of sensitivity to stronger stimuli, such as pinprick. Hypoalgesia (analgesia) is loss of sensation to painful stimuli.

Symptoms are also grouped in to negative and positive for some mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Positive symptoms are those that are present in the disorder and are not normally experienced by most individuals and reflects an excess or distortion of normal functions; examples are hallucinations, delusions, and bizarre behavior. Negative symptoms are functions that are normally found but that are diminished or absent, such as apathy and anhedonia.

=== Dynamic and static ===
Dynamic symptoms are capable of change depending on circumstance, whereas static symptoms are fixed or unchanging regardless of circumstance. For example, the symptoms of exercise intolerance are dynamic as they are brought on by exercise, but alleviate during rest. Fixed muscle weakness is a static symptom as the muscle will be weak regardless of exercise or rest.

A majority of patients with metabolic myopathies have dynamic rather than static findings, typically experiencing exercise intolerance, muscle pain, and cramps with exercise rather than fixed weakness. Those with the metabolic myopathy of McArdle&#x27;s disease (GSD-V) and some individuals with phosphoglucomutase deficiency (CDG1T/GSD-XIV), initially experience exercise intolerance during mild-moderate aerobic exercise, but the symptoms alleviate after 6–10 minutes in what is known as &quot;second wind&quot;.

===Neuropsychiatric===
Neuropsychiatric symptoms are present in many degenerative disorders including dementia, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Symptoms commonly include apathy, anxiety, and depression. Neurological and psychiatric symptoms are also present in some genetic disorders such as Wilson&#x27;s disease. Symptoms of executive dysfunction are often found in many disorders including schizophrenia, and ADHD.

===Radiologic===
Radiologic signs are abnormal medical findings on imaging scanning. These include the Mickey Mouse sign and the Golden S sign. When using imaging to find the cause of a complaint, another unrelated finding may be found known as an incidental finding.

===Cardinal===
Cardinal signs and symptoms are those that may be diagnostic, and pathognomonic – of a certainty of diagnosis. Inflammation for example has a recognised group of cardinal signs and symptoms, as does exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

In contrast to a pathognomonic cardinal sign, the absence of a sign or symptom can often rule out a condition. This is known by the Latin term &quot;sine qua non&quot;. For example, the absence of known genetic mutations specific for a hereditary disease would rule out that disease. Another example is where the vaginal pH is less than 4.5, a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis would be excluded.

===Reflexes===
A reflex is an automatic response in the body to a stimulus. Its absence, reduced (hypoactive), or exaggerated (hyperactive) response can be a sign of damage to the central nervous system or peripheral nervous system. In the patellar reflex (knee-jerk) for example, its reduction or absence is known as Westphal&#x27;s sign and may indicate damage to lower motor neurons. When the response is exaggerated damage to the upper motor neurons may be indicated.

===Facies===
A number of medical conditions are associated with a distinctive facial expression or appearance known as a facies. An example is elfin facies which has facial features like those of the elf, and this may be associated with Williams syndrome, or Donohue syndrome. The most well-known facies is probably the Hippocratic facies that is seen on a person as they near death.

===Anamnestic signs===
Anamnestic signs (from &quot;anamnēstikós&quot;, ἀναμνηστικός, &quot;able to recall to mind&quot;) are signs that indicate a past condition, for example paralysis in an arm may indicate a past stroke.

===Asymptomatic===
Some diseases including cancers, and infections may be present but show no signs or symptoms
and these are known as asymptomatic. A gallstone may be asymptomatic and only discovered as an incidental finding. Easily spreadable viral infections such as COVID-19 may be asymptomatic but may still be transmissible.

==History==
===Symptomatology===
A symptom (from Greek σύμπτωμα, &quot;accident, misfortune, that which befalls&quot;, from συμπίπτω, &quot;I befall&quot;, from συν- &quot;together, with&quot; and πίπτω, &quot;I fall&quot;) is a departure from normal function or feeling. Symptomatology (also called semiology) is a branch of medicine dealing with the signs and symptoms of a disease. This study also includes the indications of a disease. It was first described as semiotics by Henry Stubbe in 1670 a term now used for the study of sign communication.

Prior to the nineteenth century there was little difference in the powers of observation between physician and patient. Most medical practice was conducted as a co-operative interaction between the physician and patient; this was gradually replaced by a &quot;monolithic consensus of opinion imposed from within the community of medical investigators&quot;. Whilst each noticed much the same things, the physician had a more informed interpretation of those things: &quot;the physicians knew what the findings meant and the layman did not&quot;.

===Development of medical testing===
A number of advances introduced mostly in the 19th century, allowed for more objective assessment by the physician in search of a diagnosis, and less need of input from the patient. During the 20th century the introduction of a wide range of imaging techniques and other testing methods such as genetic testing, clinical chemistry tests, molecular diagnostics and pathogenomics have made a huge impact on diagnostic capability.
* In 1761 the percussion technique for diagnosing respiratory conditions was discovered by Leopold Auenbrugger. This method of tapping body cavities to note any abnormal sounds had already been in practice for a long time in cardiology. Percussion of the thorax became more widely known after 1808 with the translation of Auenbrugger&#x27;s work from Latin into French by Jean-Nicolas Corvisart.
* In 1819 the introduction of the stethoscope by René Laennec began to replace the centuries-old technique of immediate auscultation – listening to the heart by placing the ear directly on the chest, with mediate auscultation using the stethoscope to listen to the sounds of the heart and respiratory tract. Laennec&#x27;s publication was translated into English, 1824, by John Forbes.
* The 1846 introduction by surgeon John Hutchinson (1811–1861) of the spirometer, an apparatus for assessing the mechanical properties of the lungs via measurements of forced exhalation and forced inhalation. (The recorded lung volumes and air flow rates are used to distinguish between restrictive disease (in which the lung volumes are decreased: e.g., cystic fibrosis) and obstructive diseases (in which the lung volume is normal but the air flow rate is impeded; e.g., emphysema).)
* The 1851 invention by Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) of the ophthalmoscope, which allowed physicians to examine the inside of the human eye.
* The () immediate widespread clinical use of Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt&#x27;s (1836–1925) six-inch (rather than twelve-inch) pocket clinical thermometer, which he had devised in 1867.
* The 1882 introduction of bacterial cultures by Robert Koch, initially for tuberculosis, being the first laboratory test to confirm bacterial infections.
* The 1895 clinical use of X-rays which began almost immediately after they had been discovered that year by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845–1923).
* The 1896 introduction of the sphygmomanometer, designed by Scipione Riva-Rocci (1863–1937), to measure blood pressure.

==Diagnosis==
The recognition of signs, and noting of symptoms may lead to a diagnosis. Otherwise a physical examination may be carried out, and a medical history taken. Further diagnostic medical tests such as blood tests, scans, and biopsies, may be needed. An X-ray for example would soon be diagnostic of a suspected bone fracture. A noted significance detected during an examination or from a medical test may be known as a medical finding.

==Examples==

* Ascites (build-up of fluid in the abdomen)
* Nail clubbing (deformed nails)
* Cough
* Death rattle (last moments of life)
* Hemoptysis (blood-stained sputum)
* Jaundice
* Organomegaly an enlarged organ such as the liver (hepatomegaly)
* Palmar erythema (reddening of hands)
* Hypersalivation excessive (saliva)
* Unintentional weight loss

<doc id="562959" wikidata="Q3366635" url="?curid=562959" title="Progressive Canadian Party">
<text>The Progressive Canadian Party (PC Party) () was a minor centre-right federal political party in Canada. It was registered with Elections Canada, the government&#x27;s election agency, on March 29, 2004.

Under provisions of the Canada Elections Act that took effect on May 14, 2004, parties were only required to nominate one candidate in order to qualify for official party status in the June 28, 2004, federal election. This meant that Progressive Canadian Party candidates were listed on the ballot alongside the party&#x27;s name, rather than being designated as independents.

The party was deregistered by the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada on November 30, 2019, for failing to comply with Canada Elections Act requirements set out in subsection 415(1).

==Founding and 2004 election==

Following the dissolution of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and its merger with the Canadian Alliance into the new Conservative Party of Canada, the Progressive Canadian Party was formed by &quot;Red Tories&quot; who opposed the merger. One of the organizers, Joe Hueglin, was a former Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) from Niagara Falls, Ontario.

In announcing the new party, Hueglin stated that the party had about a dozen potential candidates and a mailing list of 330 names. The party nominated 16 candidates for the 2004 general election, mostly in southern Ontario and Nova Scotia.

The party held a national convention in 2005 to select a leader and to develop policies. It has also established the &quot;Macdonald-Cartier PC Fund&quot; to raise money for the party, under the direction of Sinclair Stevens, a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.

On November 17, 2005, the Federal Court of Appeal rejected Stevens&#x27; lawsuit to force Chief Electoral Officer Jean-Pierre Kingsley to rescind recognition of the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party with the Canadian Alliance. The court did rule, however, that Kingsley erred in not waiting 30 days to register the merger. Stevens appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada, but that court announced on April 27, 2006, that it would not hear the appeal. The court gave no reason for its decision.

==2006 election==

Founding party leader Ernie Schreiber resigned in 2005 because of a heart condition. The party appointed Tracy Parsons as his successor. The party nominated 25 candidates for the 2006 federal election. Former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister and leadership candidate Heward Grafftey stood as a candidate for the party during that election. &quot;(See also: Progressive Canadian Party candidates, 2006 Canadian federal election.)&quot;

==2011 election==

==2015 election==

In the 2015 election, the party ran eight candidates, none of whom were elected with five getting the fewest votes in their riding.

==Platform and goals==

The party aimed to be the successor to the former Progressive Conservative Party. A few prominent figures were associated with this new party (Stevens and Heward Grafftey). David Orchard, a fervent opponent of the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance, made no official statement about the new party. During the 2006 election, Orchard endorsed and later joined the Liberal Party.

The party adopted the last policy platform of the Progressive Conservative party; they also began to create new policies for Canada to meet new situations and challenges. These platforms included (but were not limited to): support of the Canadian Wheat Board, support for small business, belief in a single-tier health-care system, the promise of eliminating student debt, and a foreign policy that emphasizes Canada&#x27;s dual role of peace-keepers and diplomats. The new party&#x27;s official logo and initials were an homage to the Progressive Conservative Party, from where the party claims to draw its history, policy, and constitution.

===Seven Pillars for Prosperity===
According to the party&#x27;s website, the Progressive Canadian Party had &quot;seven pillars for bringing prosperity to Canada&quot;. These seven pillars are:
# &quot;Facilitating post-secondary education&quot;
# &quot;Realizing growth opportunities&quot;
# &quot;Harnessing renewable resources&quot;
# &quot;Meeting differing needs&quot;
# &quot;Serving the world&quot;
# &quot;Allying for peace and stability&quot;
# &quot;Bringing new hope&quot;

Esrange Space Center is a rocket range and research centre located about 40 kilometers east of the town of Kiruna in northern Sweden. It is a base for scientific research with high-altitude balloons, investigation of the aurora borealis, sounding rocket launches, and satellite tracking, among other things. Located 200 km north of the Arctic Circle and surrounded by a vast wilderness, its geographic location is ideal for many of these purposes.

Esrange was built in 1964 by ESRO, the &quot;European Space Research Organisation&quot;, which later became European Space Agency by merging with ELDO, the European Launcher Development Organisation. The first rocket launch from Esrange occurred on 19 November 1966. In 1972, ownership was transferred to the newly started Swedish Space Corporation.

==History==
In the 1960s, Esrange was established as an ESRO sounding rocket launching range located in Kiruna. This location was chosen because it was generally agreed that it was important to carry out a sounding rocket programme in the auroral zone, and for this reason it was essential that ESRO equip itself with a suitable range in the northern latitudes. Access to Kiruna was good by air, road and rail, and the launching range was relatively close to the town of Kiruna. Finally and perhaps decisively, Esrange could be located near Kiruna Geophysical Observatory (subsequently renamed to Swedish Institute of Space Physics). In 1972 ownership and operations of the range was transferred to the Swedish Space Corporation.

==Name==
The name of the facility was originally ESRANGE, which was an abbreviation for ESRO Sounding Rocket Launching Range.

When Swedish Space Corporation took over the range, its name became Esrange (with capital &#x27;E&#x27; only).

Esrange Space Center is the name that is currently used for the facility.

Other ways to interpret the name over the years has been European Space and Sounding Rocket Range, and European Space Range.

==Rocket activities==
There had been Swedish rocket activities previously, mainly at Kronogård (18 launches in the period 1961–1964). However, the rocket activity in Sweden did not gain thrust until after ESRO established Esrange in 1964.

During the period 1966–1972 ESRO launched more than 150 rockets from Esrange. Most of these were Centaure, Nike Apache, and Skua rockets reaching 100–220 km altitude. They supported many branches of European research, but the emphasis was on atmospheric and ionospheric research.

In 1972 the management of Esrange was transferred to the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC). Gradually the smaller rockets were complemented by larger rockets reaching higher altitudes, achieving weightlessness for a few minutes when the rocket is above the parts of the atmosphere giving an appreciable friction. Three main programmes, Texus, Maser, and Maxus currently dominate the rocket activities at Esrange and support microgravity research for ESA and DLR:

SSC, jointly with DLR, introduced a new launch service with the Suborbital Express programme launched in 2019. Suborbital Express is now integrating the Maser microgravity programme.

More than 500 rockets have been launched from Esrange since 1966. For information on individual rockets, see the List of rockets launched from Esrange.

Esrange has six launchers:
* MAXUS launcher (used for the CASTOR 4B rocket)
* MAN launcher (owned by DLR)
* MRL Launcher (used for the Orion, Nike-Orion, Taurus-Orion, Nike-Black Brant V, Terrier-Black Brant rockets)
* Skylark launch tower (now used for the VSB-30 rocket)
* FFAR launcher (used for Folding-Fin Aerial Rockets)
* SULO/VIPER launcher (used for Super Loki and VIPER rockets)

==Balloon activities==

Since 1974, more than 500 high-altitude balloons have been launched from Esrange for research purposes. The launch pad can handle balloons with volumes exceeding 1 million cubic meters.

==Satellite services==
The arctic latitude of Esrange makes it very suitable for communication with satellites in polar orbits. &quot;Esrange Satellite Station&quot; is part of a global network with stations in Canada, Alaska, Hawaii, Chile and Australia. This global network is managed from Esrange. 

&quot;Esrange Space Center&quot; satellite station focuses on data acquisition and processing for remote sensing and scientific missions as well as TT&amp;C support. The station is often used in combination with SSC&#x27;s &quot;Inuvik Satellite Station&quot; in northern Canada, to increase coverage opportunities for polar orbiting missions.

&quot;Esrange Space Center&quot; satellite station includes six independent Telemetry Tracking &amp; Command (TT&amp;C) systems in S-Band (one with receive capability also in the UHF-Band), six multi-frequency receive antenna systems in S/X-Band and an operational building which houses reception system electronics and data processing equipment. Satellite services at Esrange began in 1978.

===Satellite control services===
A number of telecommunication satellites have been controlled through Esrange:
* Tele-X (1989–1998)
* Sirius-1 (1995–2003)
* Sirius-2 (1997–2009)
* Sirius-3 (1998–2015)
* Sirius-4 (2008–)
Most research satellites of the Swedish space programme have received control commands through Esrange:
* Viking (1986–1987)
* Freja (1992–1996)
* Astrid-1 (1995)
* Odin (2001–)

The exception was controlled from SSC&#x27;s laboratories in Solna outside Stockholm:
* Astrid-2 (1998–1999)

===Ground station services===
Data have been received at Esrange from more than 50 satellites, including SPOT 1–5, Landsat 2–7, ERS-1–2 and Envisat.

==Satellite launch capability==

Ideas to use Esrange Space Center for orbital launches has existed since the inauguration of the base in 1966, then in the vision of ESRO. As new smaller launcher projects started to emerge in the beginning of the new millennia, SSC started to form new ideas to use these to obtain an orbital capability.

On October 14, 2020, Matilda Ernkrans, the Swedish Space Minister, announced the decision of the Swedish government to establish capability to launch small satellites from Esrange Space Center in northern Sweden.

The orbital launch site, LC-3, was inaugurated on 13 January 2023 as the ribbon was cut by the Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf, prime minister Ulf Kristersson together with head commissioner President Ursula Von der Leyen. There are currently plans for an orbital launch at 2024.

==Impact==

The area of the site is traditional land of the Sami people, particularly for reindeer herding. Shelters have been established for people in the surrounding area to take cover during launches.
Increased industrial, military and aeronautic activity in the region has been viewed critically by Sami people.

<doc id="562969" wikidata="Q5510689" url="?curid=562969" title="Future Imperfect">
<text>&quot;Future Imperfect&quot; is the 82nd episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. It is the eighth episode of the fourth season.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, during an away mission, Riker falls unconscious and awakens to discover that sixteen years have passed, and he is now captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Having no memory whatsoever of the time that has passed, he begins to suspect that the future he finds himself in may not be real.

==Plot==
Commander Riker&#x27;s birthday celebration is interrupted as he, Geordi La Forge, and Worf are sent down to a huge cavern on Alpha Onias III, an uninhabited Class M planet, to investigate unusual readings. After their arrival, the cavern suddenly fills with toxic gases, and the three officers fall unconscious.

Riker awakens in sick bay to find that sixteen years have passed. He is now Captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; with Data as his first officer, and Picard has been promoted to Admiral, with Deanna Troi serving as his aide. Riker cannot remember any event after the Alpha Onias III mission, which Doctor Crusher explains is a side effect of a viral infection he contracted on the planet, and his memories of the intervening events may or may not return.

Riker learns that he was married, is now widowed, and has a son (Chris Demetral) named Jean-Luc (named after Picard). He is further startled when Tomalak — a Romulan commander who was formerly an archenemy of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, now an ambassador — beams onto the ship to negotiate a peace treaty with the Federation. Despite Picard&#x27;s reassurances, Riker is hesitant to reveal sensitive Starfleet information in negotiating the treaty.

As Riker struggles to adjust to his new life, numerous inconsistencies arise. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; computer is uncharacteristically slow, numerous systems experience minor technical glitches, and Geordi is unable to correct the problems. Finally, Riker discovers that his late wife &quot;Min&quot; is Minuet, a fictional holodeck character he once met. Riker realizes that the entire &quot;future&quot; he has been experiencing is a charade and confronts Picard and Tomalak on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge, with more inconsistencies arising as he does so, proving his suspicions. Suddenly, the false future fades away, revealing a Romulan holodeck. Commander Tomalak is revealed to be behind the simulation, the object of which was to trick Riker into giving away the location of a key Federation outpost. The Romulans, Tomalak explains, were fooled by the intensity of Riker&#x27;s memories of Minuet and had incorporated her into their fantasy on the assumption that she was real.

Riker is put in a holding area, where he meets the boy whose image the Romulans had used to create his &quot;son&quot;. The boy identifies himself as &quot;Ethan&quot;. Together, they manage to escape and briefly elude their Romulan guards. However, as the two are hiding from their pursuers, Ethan inadvertently refers to Tomalak as &quot;Ambassador&quot;, instead of &quot;Commander&quot;. Riker realizes that he is still in a simulation; confronting Ethan over it, he demands that the game end immediately and that he be allowed to leave.

Everything disappears once more, leaving only Riker and Ethan back in the cavern on Alpha Onias III. Riker is then able to contact the ship and learns that Worf and La Forge had beamed up without incident, but the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was unable to locate him. After Riker advises the captain that he will presently report back after learning more about his situation, Ethan confesses that he had created the simulations, using sophisticated scanners to read his mind and create the &quot;reality&quot; they experienced. Ethan&#x27;s planet had been attacked and his people killed; his mother had hidden him in the cavern for his own safety, with all the simulation equipment, before she died; and Ethan, all alone, had been yearning for real companionship. Realizing Ethan&#x27;s intentions were not hostile, Riker offers him refuge on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Ethan accepts Riker&#x27;s offer and after Ethan reveals his true form as a grey alien named Barash, the two beam onto the ship.

<text>Eleanor Ruth Clitheroe (born January 29, 1954) is a Canadian cleric and former businesswoman. She was president and CEO of Hydro One, a successor company to Ontario Hydro owned by the Province of Ontario.

== Life and career ==
Born in Montreal, Quebec in 1954, Clitheroe earned her LL.B. from the University of Western Ontario (UWO) in 1977. In 1978 she earned her LL.M. from McGill University, and earned her M.B.A. from UWO in 1980&#x27;s. In 2005, she obtained a M.Div., from Wycliffe College. Clitheroe is a candidate for a Ph.D. in Theology at University of Toronto.

She articled at the Tory, Tory DesLauriers &amp; Binnington law firm in Toronto, and worked for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. She was Ontario&#x27;s deputy minister of finance under the New Democratic Party of Bob Rae from 1990 to 1993. She was then appointed a vice-president of Ontario Hydro. When it was reorganized into five companies, she was appointed president and CEO of Hydro One, from which she received over $2 million annual income and benefits in 2001. In 2002, she was named Business Woman of the Year by the &quot;National Post&quot;. Her tenure as CEO ended in the same year after scandal over money and management.

From 2000 until 2004, she was chancellor of the University of Western Ontario. In 2005, she was ordained a deacon in the Anglican Church of Canada, and later that year, ordained a priest. She has been the executive director of Prison Fellowship Canada, leaving the position in 2013, and Padre to the Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards. She has been pastor at St. Luke&#x27;s Anglican Church in Smithville, Ontario since 2008 and was awarded The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Medal.

Clitheroe filed a lawsuit against the utility for severance compensation and increased pension after specific legislation limiting benefits at Hydro One was passed by the Progressive Conservative government. This lawsuit and appeals were dismissed.

<doc id="562977" wikidata="Q1064912" url="?curid=562977" title="Charles Howard Hinton">
<text>Charles Howard Hinton (1853 – 30 April 1907) was a British mathematician and writer of science fiction works titled &quot;Scientific Romances&quot;. He was interested in higher dimensions, particularly the fourth dimension. He is known for coining the word &quot;tesseract&quot; and for his work on methods of visualising the geometry of higher dimensions.

==Life==
Hinton&#x27;s father, James Hinton, was a surgeon and advocate of polygamy. Charles Hinton was born in England. His siblings included the costume designer Ada Nettleship (1856 – 1932).

Hinton taught at Cheltenham College while he studied at Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained his B.A. in 1877. From 1880 to 1886, he taught at Uppingham School in Rutland, where Howard Candler, a friend of Edwin Abbott Abbott&#x27;s, also taught. Hinton also received his M.A. from Oxford in 1886.

In 1880, Hinton married Mary Ellen Boole, daughter of Mary Everest Boole and George Boole, the founder of mathematical logic. The couple had four children: George (1882–1943), Eric (born 1884), William (1886–1909) and Sebastian (1887–1923) (inventor of the jungle gym and father of William and Joan Hinton).

In 1883, he went through a marriage ceremony with Maud Florence Weldon, by whom he had had twin children, under the assumed identity of John Weldon. He was subsequently convicted of bigamy and spent three days in prison, losing his job at Uppingham. His father James Hinton was a radical advocate of polygamous relationships, and according to Charles&#x27; mother James had once remarked to her: &quot;Christ was the saviour of Men but I am the saviour of Women and I don&#x27;t envy him a bit.&quot;

In 1887, Charles moved with Mary Ellen to Japan to work in a mission before accepting a job as headmaster of the Victoria Public School. In 1893, he sailed to the United States on the SS &quot;Tacoma&quot; to take up a post at Princeton University as an instructor in mathematics.

In 1897, he designed a gunpowder-powered baseball pitching machine for the Princeton baseball team&#x27;s batting practice. The machine was versatile, capable of variable speeds with an adjustable breech size, and firing curve balls by the use of two rubber-coated steel fingers at the muzzle of the pitcher. He successfully introduced the machine to the University of Minnesota, where Hinton worked as an assistant professor until 1900, when he resigned to move to the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.

At the end of his life, Hinton worked as an examiner of chemical patents for the United States Patent Office. At age 54, he died unexpectedly of a cerebral hemorrhage on 30 April 1907 in Washington, D.C. After Hinton&#x27;s sudden death his wife, Mary Ellen, committed suicide, also in Washington, D.C., in May 1908.

==Fourth dimension==

In an 1880 article entitled &quot;&quot;, Hinton suggested that points moving around in three dimensions might be imagined as successive cross-sections of a static four-dimensional arrangement of lines passing through a three-dimensional plane, an idea that anticipated the notion of world lines. Hinton&#x27;s explorations of higher space had a moral basis:

Hinton argues that gaining an intuitive perception of higher space required that we rid ourselves of the ideas of right and left, up and down, that inheres in our position as observers in a three-dimensional world. Hinton calls the process &quot;casting out the self&quot;, equates it with the process of sympathizing with another person, and implies the two processes are mutually reinforcing.

Hinton created several new words to describe elements in the fourth dimension. According to the OED, he first used the word &quot;tesseract&quot; in 1888 in his book &quot;A New Era of Thought&quot;. Alicia Boole Stott, his sister in law who knew him at Oxford, supervised the publication of the book whilst he was abroad. He also invented the words &quot;kata&quot; (from the Greek for &quot;down from&quot;) and &quot;ana&quot; (from the Greek for &quot;up toward&quot;) to describe the additional two opposing fourth-dimensional directions (an additional 4th axis of motion analogous to left-right (x), up-down (y), and forwards-backwards (z)).

Hinton&#x27;s &quot;Scientific romances&quot;, including &quot;What is the Fourth Dimension?&quot; and &quot;A Plane World&quot;, were published as a series of nine pamphlets by Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co. during 1884–1886. In the introduction to &quot;A Plane World&quot;, Hinton referred to Abbott&#x27;s recent &quot;Flatland&quot; as having similar design but different intent. Abbott used the stories as &quot;a setting wherein to place his satire and his lessons. But we wish in the first place to know the physical facts.&quot; Hinton&#x27;s world existed along the perimeter of a circle rather than on an infinite flat plane. He extended the connection to Abbott&#x27;s work with &quot;An Episode of Flatland: Or How a Plane Folk Discovered the Third Dimension&quot; (1907).

==&quot;An Episode of Flatland or How a Plane Folk Discovered the Third Dimension…&quot; (1907)==
&quot;An Episode of Flatland or How a Plane Folk Discovered the Third Dimension, to which is bound up An Outline of the History of Unæa&quot; made its public debut in 1907, It received an unflattering paragraph review in the British scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; (1907). The action story takes place on the planar world of two-dimensional Astria on which the primary characters partake in pursuits of a scientific and romantic nature. Ultimately, some Astrians come to accept and comprehend the reality and fullness of three-dimensions in a world beyond their immediate comprehension. The book consists of a preface, an introduction, &quot;The History of Astria&quot;, and the &quot;episode&quot; referred to in the title, composed of twenty short chapters. At 53,720 words, Hinton&#x27;s work is longer than Edwin A. Abbott&#x27;s earlier, and more famous, novella &quot;Flatland&quot; (1884).

Hinton&#x27;s work combines various literary and scientific features, with the author intent on popularizing the idea of higher dimensions among educated Edwardian readers including such diverse groups as religious thinkers and believers, experimental scientists, artists, stodgy academics, engineers, politicians, and others of various persuasions and agendas. Recognizing the existence of, and even reaching, a higher dimension was not simply part and parcel to a strictly mathematical game; for Charles H. Hinton (1907), during an era when spiritualism (with the obligatory séances) was running rampant, it was important to point the way toward a higher realm of existence in both intellectual and genuinely spiritual terms.

== Influence ==
Hinton&#x27;s advocacy of the tesseract as a means to perceive higher dimensions spawned a long lineage of science fiction, fantasy, and spiritual works that similarly refer to the tesseract as a way to understand—or even access—higher dimensions, including Charles Leadbeater&#x27;s &quot;Clairvoyance&quot; (1899), Claude Bragdon&#x27;s &quot;A Primer of Higher Space&quot; (1913), Algernon Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;Victim of Higher Space&quot; (1914), H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; (1935), Robert Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;&quot;—And He Built a Crooked House—&quot;&quot; (1941), Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; (1962), and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014).

Hinton was one of the many thinkers who circulated in Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s pantheon of writers. Hinton is mentioned in Borges&#x27; short stories &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;, &quot;There Are More Things&quot; and &quot;El milagro secreto&quot; (&quot;The Secret Miracle&quot;): 

Hinton influenced P. D. Ouspensky&#x27;s thinking. Many of ideas Ouspensky presents in &quot;Tertium Organum&quot; mention Hinton&#x27;s works. He also influenced the work of occultist Aleister Crowley, whose novel &quot;Moonchild&quot; mentions Hinton, though incorrectly by the name of his father, James Hinton.

John Dewey cited Hinton&#x27;s concept of the Unlearner in &quot;Art as Experience&quot;, chapter 3. The story Unlearner appears in actually &quot;An Unfinished Communication&quot;, part of the second series of &quot;Scientific Romances&quot;. (Dewey mistakenly gives an incorrect name for the story.)

==Hinton in fiction==
Hinton is the main character of Carlos Atanes&#x27;s play &quot;Un genio olvidado (Un rato en la vida de Charles Howard Hinton)&quot; (&quot;A Forgotten Genius (The Life and Time of Charles Howard Hinton)&quot;). The play premiered in Madrid during May 2015, and was published in May 2017.

Hinton is mentioned several times in Alan Moore&#x27;s historically-based graphic novel &quot;From Hell&quot;; his theories regarding the fourth dimension form the basis of the book&#x27;s final chapter. His father, James Hinton, appears in chapters 4 and 10.

<text>The plantar reflex is a reflex elicited when the sole of the foot is stimulated with a blunt instrument. The reflex can take one of two forms. In healthy adults, the plantar reflex causes a downward response of the hallux (flexion). 

An upward response (extension) of the hallux is known as the Babinski response or Babinski sign, named after the neurologist Joseph Babinski. The presence of the Babinski sign can identify disease of the spinal cord and brain in adults, and also exists as a primitive reflex in infants.

While first described in the medical literature by Babinski in 1896, the reflex has been identified in art at least as early as Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Virgin and Child with an Angel&quot;, painted in the mid-15th century.

==Methods==
The lateral side of the sole of the foot is rubbed with a blunt instrument or device, so as not to cause pain, discomfort, or injury to the skin; the instrument is run from the heel along a curve to the toes (metatarsal pads). Many reflex hammers taper at the end of the handle to a point which was used for testing the plantar response in the past; due to the tightening of infection control regulation this is no longer recommended. Either a single use device or the thumbnail should be used.

There are three responses possible:
*Flexor: the toes curve down and inwards, and the foot inverts; this is the response seen in healthy adults.
*Indifferent: there is no response. This is called the neutral response, and has no clinical significance, as it does not rule out pathology.
*Extensor: the hallux dorsiflexes, and the other toes fan out. If elicited in an adult, it indicates damage to the central nervous system, but it is a normal reflex in infants (see below). It is also known as the Babinski Sign.

As the lesion responsible for the sign expands, so does the area from which the afferent Babinski response may be elicited. The Babinski response is also normal while asleep and after a long period of walking.

==Interpretation==
The Babinski sign can indicate upper motor neuron lesion constituting damage to the corticospinal tract. Occasionally, a pathological plantar reflex is the first and only indication of a serious disease process and a clearly abnormal plantar reflex often prompts detailed neurological investigations, including CT scanning of the brain or MRI of the spine, as well as lumbar puncture for the study of cerebrospinal fluid.

The phrase &quot;negative Babinski sign&quot; is sometimes used for the normal flexor plantar response.

===In infants===

Infants will usually show an extensor response. In one study of 256 healthy infants, the response to testing was extensor in 73.8%, flexor in 8.9%, and equivocal in 17.3% This extensor response occurs because the corticospinal pathways that run from the brain down the spinal cord are not fully myelinated at this age, so the reflex is not inhibited by the cerebral cortex. The extensor response usually disappears – giving way to the flexor response – by 12 months of age. Its persistence beyond age 2–3 indicates a problem in the brain or spinal cord.

===Pathways===
* Afferent: Nociception detected in the S1 dermatome and travels up the tibial nerve to the sciatic nerve to roots of L5,S1 and synapse in the anterior horn to elicit the motor response.
* Efferent: Motor response back through the L5,S1 roots to the sciatic nerve to its bifurcation. Toe flexors are innervated by the tibial nerve. Toe extensors (extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus) are innervated by the deep peroneal nerve. Loss of normal adult descending pyramidal control of the reflex arc to suppress extensor withdrawal results in the upgoing toes in the plantar reflex known as Babinski&#x27;s sign.

==Relationship to Hoffmann&#x27;s reflex==

The Hoffmann&#x27;s reflex is sometimes described as the upper limb equivalent of the Babinski sign because both indicate upper motor neuron dysfunction. Mechanistically, they differ significantly; the finger flexor reflex is a simple monosynaptic spinal reflex involving the flexor digitorum profundus that is normally fully inhibited by upper motor neurons. The pathway producing the plantar response is more complicated, and is not monosynaptic.

== Babinski-like responses ==
The plantar reflex can be elicited in a number of ways, which were described in the late 19th and early 20th century. These have their own eponyms.

*Bing sign – multiple pinpricks on the dorsum of the foot
*Cornell sign – scratching along the inner side of the extensor hallucis longus tendon
*Chaddock sign – stroking the lateral malleolus
* Doug&#x27;s sign – electrically stimulating peripheral nerves during a nerve conduction study
*Gonda sign – flexing and suddenly releasing the 4th toe
*Gordon sign – squeezing the calf muscle
*Moniz sign – forceful passive plantar flexion of the ankle
*Oppenheim sign – applying pressure to the medial side of the tibia
*Schaeffer sign – squeezing the Achilles tendon
* Silva sign – pinching the rectus femoris muscle
*Stransky sign – vigorously abducting and suddenly releasing the little toe
*Strümpell sign – patient attempts to flex the knee against resistance
*Throckmorton reflex – percussion over the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe

=== Abnormal reflexes seen as flexion of toes ===
*Bekhterev-Mendel reflex – flexion of the 2nd to 5th toes on percussion of the dorsum of the foot
*Rossolimo sign – exaggerated flexion of the toes induced by rapid percussion on the tips of the toes

<doc id="562983" wikidata="Q2935426" url="?curid=562983" title="Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada">
<text>Bolívar&#x27;s campaign to liberate New Granada also known as the Liberation Campaign of 1819 was part of the Colombian and Venezuelan wars of independence and was one of the many military campaigns fought by Simón Bolívar. In 1819 Bolívar led a combined New Granadan and Venezuelan Army in a campaign to liberate New Granada which had been under Spanish control since 1816.

Bolívar marched his army through the flooded plains from Venezuela and entered the Casanare Province with his army in June 1819, combining his forces with those of Francisco de Paula Santander at Tame, Arauca, on 11 June. The combined Patriot force reached the Eastern Range of the Andes on 22 June and began a grueling crossing. On 6 July, the Patriots descended from the Andes arriving at Socha and into the valleys of central New Granada. After a brief convalescence, the Patriots fought a series of battles against the III Division of the Royalist army of Spanish colonel José María Barreiro Manjón, with the campaign culminating at the decisive Battle of Boyacá, where Bolivar&#x27;s forces routed and dismantled the Royalist Army entering Santa Fe de Bogotá triumphantly 3 days later.

Bolivar&#x27;s victory in New Granada (today: Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama) secured the eventual independence of northern South America. It provided Bolívar with the economic and human resources to complete his victory over the Spanish in Venezuela and Colombia.

Bolívar&#x27;s New Granada campaign is considered one of the most daring in military history, compared by contemporaries and some historians to Hannibal&#x27;s or Napoleon&#x27;s crossing of the Alps in 1800 and José San Martín&#x27;s Crossing of the Andes in 1817.

==Background==
During the years 1815 and 1816, Spain had reconquered most of New Granada, after having deployed the Expeditionary Army of Costa Firme under the command of General Pablo Morillo from Spain in early 1815. This effort was also aided by General Juan de Sámano and his royalist forces in the south of New Granada. After five years of de facto and official independence, Morillo reestablished Royalist government in Santa Fe, leaving Juan de Sámano as Viceroy, and returned to Venezuela with the bulk of his army in late 1816.
By 1817, Bolívar had set up his headquarters in the Orinoco region in southern Venezuela. It was an area from which the Spaniards could not easily oust him. There he engaged the services of several thousand foreign soldiers and officers, mostly British and Irish, set up his capital at Angostura (now Ciudad Bolívar) and established liaisons with the revolutionary forces of the Llanos. This included one group of Venezuelan &quot;llaneros&quot; (cowboys) led by José Antonio Páez and another group of New Granadan exiles led by Colonel Francisco de Paula Santander, who was the commander of the remnant forces that made up the army of the United Provinces of New Granada and would join Bolivar&#x27;s army.

With these forces he began a campaign from Guayana, pushing Morillo westwards where his forces would reach the gates of Caracas, only to be turned back by Morillo at the 3rd Battle of La Puerta. With this defeat Bolívar retreated to the safety of &quot;Llanos&quot; of the Apure region. In early 1819, Morillo&#x27;s forces penetrated the &quot;Llanos&quot; of the Apure region with the goal of finishing off Bolívar. Bolívar defeated him at the Battle of Las Queseras del Medio in April, forcing Morillo to retreat to Calabozo, where he would stay to wait out the rain season.

After the failure of the Center Campaign a change in strategy was needed, thus the possibility of launching a military campaign to liberate New Granada was not a far-fetched idea. On August 15, 1818, in a proclamation Bolivar announced to the peoples of New Granada his intention to launch a military campaign in their country. However, most of his army was in tatters as a result of the Center Campaign, if there was any hope of carrying out this plan a new army would need to be raised, organized, and trained in order for any chance of success. The man for the job would be none other than Colonel Francisco de Paula Santander, who Bolivar had just promoted to Brigadier General on August 12, this would be followed by naming him &quot;Commander of the Vanguard of the Liberator Army of New Granada&quot; and dispatching him to the &quot;Llanos&quot; of the Casanare Province along with 1,200 muskets, uniforms, and other supplies, with the mission of creating and training a New Granadan army for a future campaign to liberate New Granada. Casanare was one of the few areas of New Granada that was free of Spanish presence, it harbored many of the New Granadans who had fled Morillo&#x27;s reconquest.

Santander along with four other officers departed Angostura on August 27 arriving in Casanare on November 28, upon arriving he found the small Patriot forces in the region in a state of anarchy with their leaders Juan Galea, Antonio Arredondo, Ignacio Mariño, and Ramón Nonato Pérez constantly fighting each other. It would be here that Santander&#x27;s organizational and leadership skills would shine, as upon arriving to the region he was able to calm the tensions amongst the military leaders in the region and impose his authority to get them to work towards a common goal.

Through the implementation of his military regulations, strict discipline, and knowledge of infantry tactics, over the course of several months Santander was able to transform a band of irregular guerrilla patriot forces into a disciplined fighting force of around 1,200 men composed of 2 line infantry battalions the first being the Cazadores Constantes Infantry Battalion and the First of the Line New Granadan Infantry Battalion along with a cavalry squadron. He would also implement a wide variety of strategies to prevent desertion, such as implementing a permit system to allow some of his men to return to their farms so that they could tend and herd cattle. This also served as a means to bolster the army&#x27;s food supply given the scarcity his army suffered.

Politically he worked with the main stakeholders in the region to reestablish the defunct United Provinces through a provisional government. He also had his troops recognize the authority of Bolivar as President of Venezuela and Captain-general of the New Granadan and Venezuelan armies for the eventual union between the two&#x27;s forces. He also sent 5 delegates to represent Casanare in the Congress of Angostura. While Santander did not discard the possibility of a permanent union between the two countries like the one Bolivar proposed, as Venezuelan support would be a necessity in order to liberate New Granada from the Spanish, he sought emphasize New Granadan autonomy and that the union be of two equals.

By early 1818, artillery Colonel José María Barreiro was the military commander of all royalist troops in New Granada, and counted with at least 4,500 trained soldiers of the III Division of the Expeditionary Army of Costa Firme scattered throughout the Kingdom. Since assuming command, he had been tasked with both to attacking and defending the kingdom against any rebel threat. He would soon have to deploy his army as both Viceroy Sámano and General Morillo through their intelligence service began to receive word of Santander&#x27;s efforts to organize an army in Casanare, with the first reports detailing his presence in the region arriving in November 1818. Come early 1819 when Morillo penetrated the Apure region in Venezuela, Barreiro was instructed by him to attack Santander in Casanare. Barreiro then organized a force of 1,200 men and 540 cavalry in March 1819, crossing the Andes and arriving in the llanos and capturing Pore in early April.

This campaign was unsuccessful: the Royalist Army became exhausted as it was badly prepared for the campaign and began to stretch their supply lines thin as Santander withdrew deeper into the llanos, eventually forcing Barreiro to withdraw to the other side of the Andes and garrison his forces in Tunja as the rainy season set in. The failure of this campaign destroyed Spanish hopes for the destruction of the rebel threat in Casanare, from now on the III Division of the Royalist Army would limit itself to defending central New Granada from the potential threat of invasion.

==The campaign==
Bolívar conceived of the operation in late 1818 and early 1819 after the Congress of Angostura began its deliberations and had reappointed him president of Venezuela. If Bolívar could liberate New Granada, he would have a whole new base from which to operate against General Pablo Morillo, head of the royalist forces in the area and end the stalemate in Venezuela. Central New Granada held great promise since, unlike Venezuela, it had only been recently conquered by Morillo and it had a prior six-year experience of independent government. Royalist sentiment, therefore, was not strong. But it would be hard to take the initiative against the better prepared and better supplied royalist army.

To surprise it, Bolívar&#x27;s proposed plan would be to move during the rainy season, when the Llanos flooded up to a meter which usually forced both sides to their winter quarters, and penetrate Central New Granada by crossing the Cordillera Oriental at the Salina pass through the Tunja Province and from there and march on the capital Santa Fe. Success depended on the rapid penetration of the central New Granada. This would be done in tandem with a diversionary effort led by Paez to invade New Granada near Cucuta in order to distract both the II Division of the Royalist Army based in Barinas, Venezuela as well as the III Division based in New Granada. Also included in the proposed plan would be a naval landing near Santa Marta or Riohacha led by Scottish adventurer Gregor MacGregor. The proposed route, however, was considered impassable, and therefore the plan understandably received little support from the Congress or from Páez.

On May 15 Santander informed Bolivar of his successes against Barreiro&#x27;s failed invasion of Casanare stating:&quot;Barreiro, general commander of this expedition, has seen with his own eyes that it is not with three or four thousand men that Casanare is conquered, and that it is not with terror that he can erase the feelings of patriotism that her own troops have for freedom. of their homeland&quot;He also informed Bolivar that his agents that he had dispatched on the other side of the Andes reported that the peoples of central New Granada were &quot;enthusiastic for their independence&quot;. In light of these events, on May 23, in the town of Mantecal Bolivar gathered all of his officers and presented his plan for the invasion of New Granada, with them agreeing to the plan. Prior to setting out for New Granada, Bolivar wrote a letter to his vice president Francisco Antonio Zea informing him of the start of the campaign and its goals stating: After the most serious meditations I have determined, having previously consulted the leaders of the army, to execute the most important operation that in our state can be undertaken... speed will be the motto of this campaign... I have been thinking about this endeavour for a long time and I hope it will surprise everyone, because no one is prepared to oppose it. On May 25, Bolívar set out with his Venezuelan troops from the town of Mantecal in the Apure region of Venezuela westwards towards Tame in New Granada to meet up with the army Santander had formed to combine their forces and then set off for the Andes.

During the march from Venezuela to New Granada a considerable number of horses and pack mules were lost to the flooded Llanos where they drowned. On June 4 they crossed the Arauca River and reached Tame on June 12, his army exhausted took the following days to rest. Once at Tame, Bolívar began the organization of the combined army of 2,500 men with him as commander-in-chief and General Carlos Soublette as his Chief of staff, the army was officially named the &quot;Liberator Army of New Granada and Venezuela&quot;. The army was organized into 2 Divisions, a Vanguard Division in the front of the army under the command of Brigadier General Francisco de Paula Santander, and a Rearguard Division, with the bulk of the army under the command of Brigadier General José Antonio Anzoátegui. Within this Rearguard Division was the British Legion under the command of Colonel James Rooke.

While at Tame, Bolivar and Santander conducted a war meeting in order to discuss which route the army would take to cross the Cordillera Oriental. While Bolivar had originally intended to take the route through La Salina pass, Santander disagreed with this and suggested taking the route through the Paramo de Pisba with Boilvar eventually agreeing with this recommendation. The pass through the Paramo de Pisba was the shortest and the least defended route, however it was also the most difficult and treacherous but with the greatest chance of surprising Spanish forces as it was deemed impassable by Barreiro especially during the rainy season. With the forces that he and Santander had recruited in the Apure and Meta River regions now combined, set off on June 17, 1819.

In order to reach the pass, the Patriot Army took the route that led to Morcote where the foothills of the Andes began which would lead them to Paya where they would begin their ascent to the last town, called Pisba, before crossing the Paramo, where they would reach the town of Socha on the other side of the Cordillera. The army&#x27;s march usually began in the early hours of the morning with troops awaken at 4am, formed up at 4:30 and marching by 5 am as the early morning weather was much easier on the troops as the heavy rain and humidity took a heavy toll on them. The Vanguard division eventually reached Morcote on 26 June and on 27 June they marched towards Paya. The rearguard was usually a day&#x27;s march behind the vanguard. The Vanguard force reached Morcote on the morning of 27 June.

=== Battle of Paya - 27 June ===
On 27 June, as the Patriot Vanguard approached the town of Paya, they spotted the presence of a Spanish Garrison guarding the town. This Spanish garrison of 2 companies which numbered around 300 men was under the command of Sergeant Major Juan Figueroa y Ladron. They were guarding the town because it was along the road that led to the main mountain pass at Labranzagrande. Santander then ordered the troops of the &quot;Cazadores&quot; Battalion to attack the Spanish force in order to clear the way for the rest of the army. The battle was short, as Figueroa ordered his troops to withdraw towards Labranzagrande when he realized that he was facing a much larger force. During the retreat he ordered his men to cut the bridge towards that town, thinking that it was the intended route for the Patriot Army. That same day 27 July, he wrote a letter to Colonel Barreiro, informing him of the battle.

=== Crossing the Andes ===
With the path cleared, the army continued its march. However that same day 27 June, Bolivar and the rearguard reached Morcote. Doubts began to arise amongst some of the Venezuelan troops and officers (apart from Bolivar) about the feasibility of the campaign, due to the lack of sufficient clothing and supplies for the difficult mountain crossing. Bolivar then convened a war council and sent a letter to Santander informing him of this, recommending that the army try crossing the Andes through Cucuta. Santander then gathered his officers (who were mostly New Granadan like him) to discuss what should be done. He then sent a letter responding to Bolivar, writing that even if the rest of the army did not wish to continue, the Vanguard force would continue the campaign whilst there was the slightest chance of success. Santander also countered Bolívar by saying that crossing the Andes through Cucuta would take far longer and that they would lose their element of surprise, allowing Barreiro to receive reinforcements from Venezuela. The conviction and determination of the New Granadan officers inspired confidence in Bolivar and the Venezuelan officer corps and as a result of this he decided to continue the campaign.

As the army ascended from the hot and humid, flood-swept plains of Venezuela of New Granada they were greeted by the freezing cold of the icy mountain pass of the Páramo de Pisba, which reached an elevation of 3,960 meters (13,000 feet), through the Cordillera Oriental. After the hardships of wading through a virtual sea, the mostly &quot;llanero&quot; army was not prepared and poorly clothed for the cold and altitude of the mountains as well as the heavy rainfall they experienced.

The army was split into 3 sections in order to facilitate the crossing with a small force composed of the &quot;Cazadores&quot; battalion under Colonel Antonio Arredondo crossing first arriving July 3. Santander and the Vanguard division followed suit, both he and Arredondo&#x27;s units were able to weather the climate better as they were mostly from the Andes. This force arrived in Socha on July 4 and sent back men to assist the struggling Rearguard in their crossing. Anzoategui and the rearguard division began to cross the Paramo on July 5 and had spent the night on the plateau. Bolivar, who was with them, described the crossing: &quot;That same day we entered the Paramo, while the weather was good, the troops suffered a lot from the cold and we lost all beasts of saddle and burden; It has been rare that one would make it.&quot; The rearguard suffered heavily during the crossing as their troops were mostly men of the &quot;Llanos&quot;.

During the night many froze to the death due to the scarcity of vegetation in the area preventing the building of fires for warmth. The rearguard eventually descended on 6 July. General Soublette, who was still in Paya, informed Bolivar that the British Legion would cross on the 13th. During the crossing, 100 men had perished and a number of soldiers had deserted. In Socha, some 500 men were hospitalized and had to be cared for by the townsfolk. Santander commented on the sorry state of the army, stating that &quot;the army was a dying body.&quot;

=== Barreiro&#x27;s reaction ===

Since June 1819, the Spanish had received intelligence that Bolívar was possibly on the move. However, they doubted that Bolívar&#x27;s army could make the trip during the rainy season. Barreiro who had been garrisoned in Tunja since May was informed about the reunion of Bolívar and Santander in Tame on June 25 and their intentions of penetrating central New Granada, the same day he informed Viceroy Juan de Sámano of the situation. He then considered several paths through which Bolívar could cross the mountains: La Salina, Paya (Pisba), Pueblo Viejo, Medina, Miraflores, Tenza valley and Cáqueza. He discarded the first four, considering them too difficult and costly in human lives, especially in the winter season. He also ruled out penetration through Cáqueza, because it was located too far to the south. He assumed that Bolívar would choose the one in the Tenza Valley as the most appropriate and sent a number of forces there to guard the pass.

Barreiro soon found himself in a difficult situation: he did not dare to cross the mountain range and attack Bolívar, because he feared opening any other passage for him on a front that extended almost 250 kilometers. Furthermore, he did not see the possibility of maintaining his troops on the other side of the mountains, practically cut off from Tunja and the capital. He therefore chose to wait, while alarming and contradictory reports began to arrive such as one that informed that Bolívar was going to meet Páez in Píedecuesta. He tried to gather, as far as the security of the Kingdom allowed, several detachments of his army, who had been stationed at widely dispersed points.

Finally, on July 5 he received news that 500 cattle were led from Paya to Pisba and on the 6th, that the enemy army had moved towards the moor towards Pisba and Socotá, confirming that the Patriots had taken the route through the Páramo de Pisba. When Bolívar arrived in Socha on July 6 his army was in a weakened state and at its most vulnerable, however Barreiro preferred to stay garrisoned in Tunja in order to concentrate his forces that had been dispersed throughout the province. Viceroy Sámano grew frustrated with this approach and decided to relieve Barreiro of his command and replace him with Colonel Sebastian de la Calzada, who was commander of the 400 strong European Aragon Battalion which guarded Santa Fe, as commander of the III Division dispatching him to Tunja at once. Barreiro however refused to obey this order as it would &quot;Stain his honor as a military officer&quot; and also told the Viceroy that only General Pablo Morillo had the authority to relieve him of his command, as a result he ordered de la Calzada to return to Santa Fe.

During this time Bolívar remained near Socha as he began to rebuild his weakened army, this was aided with the support of the local people of the Tunja Province (modern day: Boyacá Department) who sewed uniforms, provided men for the army, as well as horses to replace the losses suffered during the crossing of the Paramo. The support of the local people for the Patriot Army had been noted by Royalist officials, with Barreiro complaining about this in his communications with Viceroy Samano. While the bulk of the army rested for 4 days in Socha, Bolívar ordered Santander&#x27;s Vanguard force to take control of the nearby towns of Corrales and Gámeza, Gámeza in particular was important strategically as there was a bridge there that crosses the Gameza river which was swollen during this time of year. On July 7 this vanguard force engaged in small skirmishes with patrolling Royalist squads dispatched from Sogamoso by the local Spanish commander Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Gonzalez. As reports of the Patriot troops taking nearby towns reached Gonzalez he decided to fall back from Sogamoso towards Tunja.

=== Corrales and Gameza - 10 July ===
On July 8, Barreiro after hearing about the Patriot presence near Corrales and Gameza finally moved his army in the direction towards Sogamoso where he was joined by Gonzalez, arriving there on the night of July 9. The next morning July 10 he ordered his troops to conduct a reconnaissance sweep in the area of the towns of Corrales and Gameza. In the direction of Corrales he dispatched 30 men under the command of Lieutenant Manuel Gutierrez and to Gameza a company of grenadiers of the King&#x27;s 1st Battalion as well as some dragoons numbering 200. Lieutenant Gutierrez&#x27;s troops who were near Corrales encountered 20 Patriot Cavalry, Gutierrez ordered his men to chase after them where they were subsequently ambushed by 300 Patriots under the command of Colonel Justo Briceño who were hiding in nearby buildings, as a result of this action the Royalist squad was decimated with only Gutierrez and 4 dragoons managing to escape, the force that had been deployed to Gameza was also forced to withdraw.

As a result of these circumstances Barreiro advanced along the banks of the Chicamocha River setting his headquarters in a place known as Topaga Mills, once there he sent reinforcements in order to support his forces near Corrales and Gameza. These reinforcements pushed back the Patriot advances, with the Patriot Cavalry being chased down by Spanish forces past the town of Corrales where they were forced to throw themselves into the river in order to escape. As a result of these skirmishes Spanish casualties were 20 men dead and 5 captured, meanwhile the Patriot infantry was almost entirely wiped out. With this Barreiro achieved a partial victory of which he informed the Viceroy about in his letter. The Spanish also captured a large group of Patriot troops who were unable to retreat across the swollen river, these prisoners were tied up in a group and executed by bayonet on the orders of Barreiro to conserve ammunition.

=== Gameza Bridge - 11 July ===
After the battle of Corrales, on July 11 Barreiro deployed around 900 infantry and 180 cavalry to take Gameza bridge, this force marched on the morning of July 11 from Molinos de Topaga. The Spanish vanguard force was dispatched ahead and crossed the bridge over the Gámeza River and continued the ascent of the slope where the town is located.

Barreiro, who was marching at the head of the main group, observed when he arrived near the bridge that a column was coming from the top of the mountain, above the town. He immediately ordered the Numancia battalion to halt their positions. He then saw that the other columns were coming down, apparently to attack the royalist force. He estimated the enemy at 2,000 infantry and 150 cavalry divided into five columns. These forces were the vanguard and rearguard divisions of Santander and Anzoátegui, that is, the entire Patriot Army.

Barreiro considering that the Numancia battalion could be cut off from retreating along the river, ordered its unit commander, Lieutenant Colonel Juan Tolrá, to withdraw his battalion to the left bank, that is, behind the bridge, taking into account the direction of the river. Bolivar saw this movement, and ordered the Cazadores Battalion as well as a company from each of the Rifles, Barcelona and Bravos of Páez battalions to charge the royalists.

This led both the patriots and royalists, to take defensive positions on both sides of the river with both attempting to cross each others sides various times to no avail, the battle lasted between 5 and 8 hours with neither able to cross both armies withdrew to their previous positions. As a result of the battle the Patriots suffered 180 casualties with Santander himself being lightly wounded as well as Colonel Antonio Arriendo being mortally wounded and dying a few days later, leading to his second in command Joaquin Paris being promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and being given command of the Cazadores Battalion.

The Royalists suffered 74 casualties, during the encounter both sides expended a large amount of ammunition with the Spanish having expended some 35,000 Paper cartridges (39 rounds per soldier) forcing Barreiro to urgently request more ammunition from the Viceroy.

===Vargas Swamp - 25 July===
After the results of the Battle of Gameza, Bolivar changed his strategy disregarding his initial plan for a frontal assault on Sogamoso and instead opting for a flanking maneuver through Cerinza Valley. By July 18 Bolivar was in Belen de Cerinza, the next day they reached Santa Rosa, and on July 20 the bulk of the army reached Duitama and camped there while the Vanguard took up positions in an area known as Bonza. This movement caused Barreiro to fall back towards the town of Paipa where he hoped to intercept him.

By 22 July the British Legion had finally crossed Páramo de Pisba and rejoined the army, the Patriot army now numbered around 2,400 men. Bolivar now at full strength, still aimed to reach the capital Santa Fe through the main Camino Real, however he would need to cross the swollen Chicamocha River in order to do this. On 23 July the Patriot army began building rafts to ford the river, these would be completed by late 24 July. On the early hours of July 25 the Patriot Army attempted to cross the Chicamocha River near an area called Puente de Balsa, this crossing would be complicated by the collapse of some of the rafts which delayed the army significantly.

This delay was noticed by royalist spies in the vicinity who informed Barreiro of this, Barreiro camped in Paipa now knew Bolivar intended to take the road from Salitre and Paipa. The Royalist Army was able to muster 1,800 men as some of troops from the surrounding areas finally rejoined the bulk of the army. Barreiro moved quickly to place his troops on favorable ground on top of Picacho and Cangrejo hills in an area near Vargas Swamp that served as a chokepoint between the Salitre to Paipa road arriving there at 11am. The Patriot Army arrived at 12pm and immediately did battle with the Royalist Army.

The Battle of Vargas Swamp lasted 5 hours as the Patriot Army tried repeatedly to dislodge Spanish forces from their positions on Picacho Hill, Cangrejo Hill, and the main road that bordered the swamp. Time and time again the Royalists were able to hold off and push back the Patriots. Around 5pm the Patriots began to fall back in disarray, seeing this Barreiro committed his reserve infantry and cavalry for a frontal assault in tandem with a flanking maneuver in order to encircle the patriots to finish them off. Bolivar in an act of desperation committed his reserve cavalry under the command of Colonel Juan José Rondón who led an uphill charge with 14 lancers that managed to penetrate the Spanish line on Cangrejo Hill. Rondón&#x27;s charge caught the Spanish off guard and inflicted heavy casualties on the Spanish reserve infantry. Lt. Colonel Lucas Carvajal also charged with his cavalry squadron in support of Rondón, concentrating his attack on the main road where Hussars of Ferdinand VII had been advancing along.. At the same time Santander&#x27;s Vanguard force along with the British Legion under Rooke, led a renewed bayonet charge up Picacho Hill which dislodged the Spanish forces there as well, however Rooke would be mortally wounded as a result of the charge dying a few days later. While the Royalists had been pushed back, their forces were mostly intact and were able to avoid further destruction thanks to a tropical rainstorm that covered their withdrawal towards Paipa.

The Patriot army withdrew to the Chicamocha River. This uphill battle for Bolivar was a close victory, however it was ultimately indecisive as neither side was able to decimate the other. Both armies suffered heavy loses as a result, with Barreiro suffering around 400-500 dead and Bolivar 300 dead as well numerous wounded. Barreiro in his letter to the Viceroy informed him that it was the Royalist Army that triumphed at Vargas swamp but that the tropical storm had prevented it from crushing the Patriots.

===Boyacá - 7 August===

After the Battle of Vargas Swamp, the losses suffered by Bolivar&#x27;s army had left the army nonoperational, to remedy this he decreed martial law in the area on 28 July and conscripted all men from the ages 14 to 60 to rebuild his force. The Patriot Army rested until August 3, when Bolivar ordered a return to Venezuela retreating across the Chicamocha River which was observed by Barreiro&#x27;s forces. This was feint however, as during the night, he redirected his forces and crossed the river again and marched towards Tunja taking the alternate way through the Toca Road. The Patriot Army took the city by mid-day of 5 August 1819, in the city the Patriots were able to capture 600 muskets as well as uniforms, blankets and other important supplies.

Barreiro was not aware of this until August 5, and marched his army down the Camino Real de Santa Fe in the direction of Tunja, where he was joined by Royalist reinforcements under the command of Colonel Juan Loño who had been sent by the Viceroy, who provided him with munitions as well as 3 cannon that he had so requested from the Viceroy. Barreiro continued his march towards Tunja and was informed of its capture by passersby, with Tunja captured his defensive strategy had failed and he was now obliged to mobilize his troops to cut Bolivar&#x27;s advance defend the capital, Santafé.

Barreiro now needed take the fastest route to Santa Fe, he hoped to fool the Patriots by conducting a night march in the rain around Tunja through the towns of Combita and Motavita, the arduous march was conducted the same day August 5 with the Royalist Army arriving in Motavita during the early hours of August 6. the Royalists believed they had moved undetected. Taking Motavita was important as it sat at an elevation of 3.200 meters allowing the Royalists to observe Tunja from its heights.

On the early hours of August 7, the Royalist Army, now with some 2,670 troops, continued their march to Santa Fe. In order to rejoin the main Camino Real that led to Santa Fe the Royalist troops would have to march some 45 km from Motavita through the Samaca Road that rejoined the main Camino Real at the Boyaca Bridge which crossed the overflowing Teatinos River. Barreiro then split his army in two, sending a vanguard force to hold the bridge and wait until the rest of the army caught up.

Unbeknownst to Barreiro, was that spies had informed the Patriots of the Royalist Army&#x27;s march to Motavita, Bolivar on the morning of August 7 observed Barreiro&#x27;s march in the direction of Boyaca Bridge from the San Lazaro Heights near Tunja. At 9am he ordered Santander and Anzoategui to intercept Barreiro at the Boyaca Bridge. The Patriot Army mustered some 2,850 troops, and marched down the Camino Real from Tunja and successfully intercepted Barreiro at the Boyaca Bridge around 2 in the afternoon.

The Battle of Boyacá was the decisive culmination of the campaign, as the Patriot Army successfully divided and defeated the 2,670 royalist soldiers in a battle that lasted two hours. Santander pinned down the Spanish Vanguard by the bridge while Anzoategui led his infantry and cavalry into the heart of Barreiro&#x27;s rearguard. The battle resulted in 66 Patriot casualties, 250 Royalist casualties, as well as the capture of approximately 1,600 of the remaining troops of the III Division. Colonel Barrerio was also captured himself alongside 37 of his officers. The III Division was effectively dismantled at the Battle of Boyaca with only a small group of soldiers and officers, the most notable being Barreiro&#x27;s chief-of-staff Colonel Sebastian Diaz, who were able to flee and avoid being captured or killed.

== Aftermath ==
News of the Royalist Army&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Boyacá reached Santa Fe on the night of August 8, Viceroy Juan José de Sámano was shocked at the news as his last communications with Barreiro had been his supposed victory over the Patriots at Vargas Swamp. Samano and the rest of royalist government fled the capital in the direction of Honda where they would take the Magdalena River up to Cartagena de Indias the very next morning, leaving behind the treasury. The 400 troops belonging to the Aragon Battalion under the command of Colonel Sebastian de la Calzada also left the capital in the direction towards Popayan but not before destroying the gunpowder supply in the city.

On the afternoon of 10 August Bolívar&#x27;s army entered Santa Fe without any royalist resistance. His arrival concluded the campaign for liberating New Granada. The battle of Boyacá was a decisive triumph over Spanish power in New Granada, and the Spanish America as a whole. Despite the royalists&#x27; strength in the other provinces of the region, such as Santa Marta and Pasto – where resistance withstood various years of revolutionary uprisings – the capital of the viceroyalty of New Granada had fallen into the hands of the Patriots.

==Political ramifications==
With New Granada secure, Bolívar returned to Venezuela in a position of unprecedented military, political and financial strength. In his absence, the Congress had flirted with deposing him, assuming that he would meet his death in New Granada. The vice-president Francisco Antonio Zea was deposed and replaced by Juan Bautista Arismendi. All this was quickly reversed when word got to the Congress of Bolívar&#x27;s success. In December Bolívar returned to Angostura, where he urged the Congress to proclaim the creation of a new state: the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia). It did so on 17 December and elected him president of the new country. Since two of its three regions, Venezuela and Quito (Ecuador), were still under royalist control, it was only a limited achievement. Bolívar continued his efforts against the royalist areas of Venezuela, culminating in the Battle of Carabobo two years later, which all but secured his control of northern South America. Bolívar&#x27;s victory in New Granada was, therefore, a major turning point in the history of northern South America. With this shift in political power, the path was laid out for the union of New Granada and Venezuela into the Republic of Colombia. However, the campaigns for independence would continue: Antonio José de Sucre marched South, towards Pasto, the Audiencia de Quito, the Viceroyalty of Peru, and Upper Peru, while Bolivar sought to expand the campaign to the westernmost regions of Venezuela, which still lay under Spanish power, and counted with 27,000 soldiers for its defense.

<doc id="562985" wikidata="Q1363912" url="?curid=562985" title="Island Gardens DLR station">
<text>Island Gardens is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station next to Island Gardens on the Isle of Dogs, East London. It is just north of the River Thames and is close to the southern tip of the Isle of Dogs and the River Thames.

Island Gardens is a public park with a notable view across the river to the classical buildings of the former Greenwich Hospital and the National Maritime Museum, with Greenwich Park forming a backdrop. The northern entrance of the Greenwich foot tunnel is within the park.

==History==

The original Island Gardens DLR station was opened on 31 August 1987 as the southern terminus of the initial system. It was built adjacent to the site of the old North Greenwich railway station, which had been the southern terminus of the former Millwall Extension Railway, which had closed to passengers in 1926. The new station was elevated with two platforms, each capable of accommodating a single-car train. The design incorporated false arches to match the existing single-track viaduct. The station required significant rebuilding to allow the platforms to take two-car trains. 

=== Pre-opening incident ===
On 10 March 1987, before the system opened, a test train crashed through buffer stops at the original high-level terminus and was left hanging from the end of the elevated track. The accident was caused by unauthorised tests being run before the correct installation of the wayside safety system had been verified; an omission in the wayside system allowed the train to travel too fast on the approach to the terminus. The train was being driven manually at the time.

=== Extension to Lewisham ===
In the mid 1990s, construction began to extend the DLR south by to Lewisham. As the line would pass under the River Thames in deep tube tunnel, a new station would have to be built slightly further away from the river, north of Manchester Road, and underground. The new station and tunnel to Mudchute was built using the cut and cover method, with Millwall Park reinstated on top of the tunnel. In January 1999, the original Island Gardens station was closed, to allow construction of the connection to the extension to continue. 

Island Gardens station reopened in November 1999 as part of the opening of the DLR extension to Lewisham. As with other stations on the extension, the station was designed by consultant W S Atkins. Ducts for the tunnel ventilation system are integrated into the architecture of the station.

The original 1987 station and the southern end of the connecting viaduct were subsequently demolished.

==Station layout==
One of only four completely underground stations on the DLR network, Island Gardens station has an island platform with a track each side of it. Located just below the surface, the platform is accessed by stairs, with a lift making the station accessible.

==Connections==

London Buses routes 135, the &quot;D&quot; prefix route D7 and night route N550 serve the station.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Island Gardens is:
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 22 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours running to and from instead of Bank.

<text>Wiley Hardeman Post (November 22, 1898 – August 15, 1935) was an American aviator during the interwar period and the first pilot to fly solo around the world. Known for his work in high-altitude flying, he helped develop one of the first pressure suits and discovered the jet stream. On August 15, 1935, he and American humorist Will Rogers were killed when his aircraft crashed on takeoff from a lagoon near Point Barrow in the Territory of Alaska.

Post&#x27;s Lockheed Vega aircraft, the &quot;Winnie Mae&quot;, was on display at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center from 2003 to 2011. It is now featured in the &quot;Time and Navigation&quot; gallery on the second floor of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C..

==Early life==
Post was born to parents who cultivated cotton on a farm near Grand Saline, Texas. His father was William Francis and his mother was Mae Quinlan Post, a person of mixed Cherokee heritage. His family moved to Oklahoma when he was five. He was an indifferent student, but managed to complete the sixth grade. By 1920, his family settled on a farm near Maysville, Oklahoma.

In 1913, Post first saw an aircraft in flight at the county fair in Lawton, Oklahoma. It was a Curtiss-Wright &quot;Pusher type&quot;. The event so inspired him that he immediately enrolled in the Sweeney Automobile and Aviation School in Kansas City. Seven months later, he returned to Oklahoma, and went to work at the Chickasaw and Lawton Construction Company.

During World War I Post wanted to become a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Service (USAS). Joining the training camp at the University of Oklahoma, he learned radio technology. Germany agreed to an armistice before he completed his training. The war ended, and he went to work as a &quot;roughneck&quot; in the Oklahoma oilfields. The work was unsteady, so he turned briefly to armed robbery. He was arrested in 1921 and sent to the Oklahoma State Reformatory, serving more than a year there. He was paroled in summer 1922.

==Early flying career==

Post&#x27;s aviation career began at age 26 as a parachutist for a flying circus, &quot;Burrell Tibbs and His Texas Topnotch Fliers,&quot; and he became well known on the barnstorming circuit. On October 1, 1926, he was badly injured in an oil-rig accident when a piece of metal pierced his left eye. An infection permanently blinded him in it, and he typically wore an eyepatch thereafter. He used the settlement money to buy his first aircraft.

Around this time, Post met fellow Oklahoman Will Rogers when he flew Rogers to a rodeo, and they eventually became close friends. Post was the personal pilot of wealthy Oklahoma oilmen Powell Briscoe and F.C. Hall in 1930, when Hall bought a high-wing, single-engine Lockheed Vega, one of the most famous record-breaking aircraft of the early 1930s. The oilman nicknamed it the &quot;Winnie Mae&quot; after his daughter, and Post achieved his first national prominence in it by winning the National Air Race Derby, from Los Angeles to Chicago. The fuselage was inscribed &quot;Los Angeles to Chicago 9 hrs. 8 min. 2 sec. August 27, 1930.&quot; Adam Charles Williams finished second with a time of 9 hrs. 9 min. 4 sec. Post earned a prize of $7,500. The equivalent of $112,053 in 2020.

===Around the world===
In 1930, the record for flying around the world was not held by a fixed-wing aircraft, but by the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, piloted by Hugo Eckener in 1929 with a time of 21 days. On June 23, 1931, Post and the Australian navigator Harold Gatty left Roosevelt Field on Long Island, New York, in the &quot;Winnie Mae&quot; with a flight plan that would take them around the world, stopping at Harbour Grace, Flintshire, Hanover twice, Berlin, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Blagoveshchensk, Khabarovsk, Nome (where his propeller had to be repaired), Fairbanks (where the propeller was replaced), Edmonton, and Cleveland before returning to Roosevelt Field. 

They arrived back on July 1, after traveling in the record time of 8 days and 15 hours and 51 minutes, in the first successful aerial circumnavigation by a single-engined monoplane. The reception they received rivaled Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s everywhere they went. They had lunch at the White House on July 7, rode in a ticker-tape parade the next day in New York City, and were honored at a banquet given by the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce of America at the Hotel Astor. After the flight, Post acquired the &quot;Winnie Mae&quot; from F.C. Hall. He and Gatty published an account of their journey, titled &quot;Around the World in Eight Days,&quot; with an introduction by Will Rogers.

===First solo pilot===

After the record-setting flight, Post wanted to open his own aeronautical school, but could not raise enough financial support because of doubts many had about his rural background and limited formal education. Motivated by his detractors, he decided to attempt a solo flight around the world and to break his previous speed record. Over the next year, he improved his aircraft by installing an autopilot device and a radio direction finder, that were in their final stages of development by the Sperry Gyroscope Company and the United States Army.

In 1933, Post repeated his flight around the world, this time using the auto-pilot and compass in place of his navigator and becoming the first to accomplish the feat alone. He departed from Floyd Bennett Field and continued on to Berlin where repairs were attempted to his autopilot, stopped at Königsberg to replace some forgotten maps, Moscow for more repairs to his autopilot, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk for final repairs to the autopilot, Rukhlovo, Khabarovsk, Flat where his propeller had to be replaced, Fairbanks, Edmonton, and back to Floyd Bennett Field. Fifty thousand people greeted him on his return on July 22 after 7 days, 18 hours, 49 minutes.

==Pressure suit==
In 1934, with financial support from Frank Phillips of the Phillips Petroleum Company, Post began exploring the limits of high-altitude long-distance flight. The &quot;Winnie Mae&quot;&#x27;s cabin could not be pressurized, so he worked with Russell S. Colley of the B.F. Goodrich Company to develop what became the world&#x27;s first practical pressure suit. Three pressure suits were fabricated for Post. Only the final version was successful. The first suit ruptured during a pressure test. The redesigned second suit used the same helmet as the first but when tested was too tight. They were unable to remove it from Post, so they had to cut him out, destroying the suit. The third suit was redesigned from the previous two.

The body of the suit had three layers: long underwear, an inner black rubber air pressure bladder, and an outer layer made of rubberized parachute fabric. The outer layer was glued to a frame with arm and leg joints that allowed him to operate the flight controls and to walk to and from the aircraft. Attached to the frame were pigskin gloves, rubber boots, and an aluminum-and-plastic diver&#x27;s helmet.

The helmet had a removable faceplate that could be sealed at a height of , and could accommodate earphones and a throat microphone. The helmet was cylinder-shaped with a circular window. In the first flight using the suit on September 5, 1934, Post reached an altitude of above Chicago. Eventually flying as high as , he discovered the jet stream and made the first major practical advances in pressurized flight. As of 2022, the suit is on display.

===Attempted high altitude non-stop transcontinental flights===
Between February 22 and June 15, 1935, Post made four unsuccessful attempts to complete the first high altitude non-stop flight from Los Angeles to New York, all of which failed for various mechanical reasons. The first attempt on February 22 ended 57.5 miles north of Los Angeles at Muroc Field, CA (Now Edwards AFB). This was followed by attempts on March 15 (Cleveland, Ohio; 2,035 miles), April 14 (Lafayette, Indiana; 1,760 miles), and June 15 (Wichita, KS; 1,188 miles).

As the attempts were meant to be the &quot;First Air Mail Stratosphere Flight&quot; over U.S. Air Mail Route #2 (AM-2) from Los Angeles to New York, Post carried a quantity of &quot;cacheted&quot; covers sponsored by Transcontinental &amp; Western Air, Inc on all four flights. When he was killed on August 15, 1935, ending the possibility of any more attempts to complete the AM-2 stratosphere flight, the covers were cancelled in Los Angeles on August 20, 1935, and forwarded to their addressees.

==Final flight and death==

In 1935, Post became interested in surveying a mail-and-passenger air route from the West Coast of the United States to Russia. Short on cash, he built a hybrid using parts salvaged from two different aircraft: the fuselage of an airworthy Lockheed Orion and the wings of a wrecked experimental Lockheed Explorer. The Explorer wing was six feet longer in span than the Orion&#x27;s original wing, an advantage that extended the range of the hybrid aircraft.

As the Explorer wing did not have retractable landing gear, it lent itself to the fitting of floats for landing in the lakes of Alaska and Siberia. Lockheed refused to make the modifications Post requested, on the grounds that the two designs were incompatible and potentially a dangerous mix, so he made the changes himself.

Post&#x27;s friend, Will Rogers, visited him often at the airport in Burbank, California, while Pacific Airmotive Ltd. was modifying the aircraft, and asked Post to fly him to Alaska in search of new material for his newspaper column. When the floats Post had ordered were delayed, he used a set designed for a larger aircraft, making the aircraft more nose-heavy than it already was. According to the research of Bryan Sterling, however, the floats were the correct type for the aircraft.

After making a test flight in July, Post and Rogers left Lake Washington, near Seattle, in early August and made several stops in Alaska. While Post piloted the aircraft, Rogers wrote his columns on his typewriter. On August 15, they left Fairbanks for Point Barrow. They were a few miles from there when they became uncertain of their position in bad weather and landed in a lagoon to ask for directions. On takeoff, the engine failed at low altitude, and the aircraft, uncontrollably nose-heavy at low speed, plunged into the lagoon, shearing off the right wing, and ended up inverted in the shallow part. Both Post and Rogers died instantly.
Post is buried in Memorial Park Cemetery, section 48, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

==Honors and tributes==
In 1936, the Smithsonian Institution acquired the &quot;Winnie Mae&quot; from Post&#x27;s widow for $25,000. Two monuments at the crash site commemorate the death of him and Will Rogers and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The nearby Wiley Post–Will Rogers Memorial Airport located in Utqiagvik, Alaska bears their names.

Wiley Post Airport, a large FAA designated reliever airport in Oklahoma City, is named after Post. Oklahoma City&#x27;s major commercial airport is named after Will Rogers, so that both victims of the crash are honored by airports in Oklahoma City. The Will Rogers – Wiley Post Memorial Seaplane Base is a seaplane base located on Lake Washington, at the north end of the Renton Municipal Airport in Renton, Washington.

The U.S. Army Air Forces, later the United States Air Force, named a street after Post on the former Maywood Army Air Forces Specialized Storage Depot, later Cheli Air Force Station. No longer owned by the federal government, Wiley Post Road remains, connecting Bandini Boulevard and Lindbergh Lane in Bell, California.

Post received the Distinguished Flying Cross (1932), the Gold Medal of Belgium (1934), and the International Harmon Trophy (1934). In 1969, he was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame. On December 17, 1970, he was inducted into the First Flight Society&#x27;s First Flight Shrine, located at the Wright Brothers National Memorial.

In 1997, Post was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

In 1979, the United States Postal Service honored Post with two airmail stamps.

In 2004, Post was inducted posthumously into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.

For many years, The Wiley Post Commission, based in Oklahoma City, presented the annual Wiley Post Spirit Award to &quot;an individual in general aviation who best exemplifies the innovative and pioneering spirit of Wiley Post&quot;.

<doc id="563015" wikidata="Q4849349" url="?curid=563015" title="Bakewell pudding">
<text>Bakewell pudding is an English dessert consisting of a flaky pastry base with a layer of sieved jam and topped with a filling made of egg and almond paste.

==Etymology==

References to &quot;Bakewell pudding&quot; appear earlier than the term &quot;Bakewell tart&quot;, which entered common usage in the 20th century.

In the &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot; by Alan Davidson, it is claimed the earliest reference to &quot;Bakewell pudding&quot; comes from &quot;The Cook and Housewife&#x27;s Manual&quot; by Margaret Dods, published in 1826. This is, however, erroneous as no recipe for &quot;Bakewell pudding&quot; (or indeed Bakewell tart) appears in the 1826 edition. A recipe for &quot;bakewell pudding&quot; does, however, appear in the 1847 edition.

==History==
The pudding originated in the Derbyshire town of Bakewell. The origins of the pudding are not clear, but a common story is that it was first made by accident in 1820 (other sources cite 1860) by Mrs Greaves, who was the landlady of the White Horse Inn (since demolished). She supposedly left instructions for her cook to make a jam tart. The cook, instead of stirring the eggs and almond paste mixture into the pastry, spread it on top of the jam. When cooked, the egg and almond paste set like an egg custard, and the result was successful enough for it to become a popular dish at the inn.

The dates and/or premises given in this story are unlikely to be accurate as the White Horse Inn was demolished in 1803 to make way for the development of Rutland Square and subsequently the Rutland Arms Hotel. Additionally, Eliza Acton provides a recipe for &#x27;Bakewell pudding&#x27; in her book &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; which was published in 1845, making the pudding&#x27;s creation date of 1860 impossible.

One of the earliest verifiable examples of a Bakewell pudding recipe comes from &quot;The Magazine of Domestic Economy&quot; issued in London in 1836. Eliza Acton published a recipe in her 1845 work &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; and Mrs Beeton published two recipes for Bakewell pudding, one which used a pastry base and one which used breadcrumbs, in her &quot;Book of Household Management&quot; in 1861.

<doc id="563019" wikidata="Q1722708" url="?curid=563019" title="Manson Family">
<text>The Manson Family (known among its members as the Family) was a commune, gang, and cult led by criminal Charles Manson that was active in California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The group at its peak consisted of approximately 100 followers, who lived an unconventional lifestyle, frequently using psychoactive drugs, including amphetamine and hallucinogens such as LSD. Most were young women from middle-class backgrounds, many of whom were attracted by hippie counterculture and communal living, and then radicalized by Manson&#x27;s teachings. The group murdered at least 9 people, and may have killed as many as 24.

Manson was born in 1934 and had been institutionalized or incarcerated for more than half of his life by the time he was released from prison in 1967. He began attracting acolytes in the San Francisco area. They gradually moved to a run-down ranch, called the Spahn Ranch, in Los Angeles County. The ranch burned down during a Southern California wildfire in September 1970.

According to group member Susan Atkins, the members of the Family became convinced that Manson was a manifestation of Jesus Christ, and believed in his prophecies concerning an imminent, apocalyptic race war.

In 1969, Manson Family members Susan Atkins, Charles Denton &quot;Tex&quot; Watson, and Patricia Krenwinkel entered the home of Hollywood actress Sharon Tate and murdered her and four others. Linda Kasabian was also present, but did not take part. The following night, members of the Family murdered supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary at their home in Los Angeles. Members also committed a number of assaults, petty crimes, theft and street vandalism, including an assassination attempt on U.S. President Gerald Ford in 1975 by Manson Family member Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme.

== Formation ==

===San Francisco followers===
Following his release from prison on March 22, 1967, Charles Manson moved to San Francisco, where, with the help of a prison acquaintance, he moved into an apartment in Berkeley. In prison, bank robber Alvin Karpis had taught Manson to play the steel guitar. Living mostly by begging, Manson soon became acquainted with Mary Brunner, a 23-year-old graduate of University of Wisconsin–Madison. Brunner was working as a library assistant at the University of California, Berkeley, and Manson moved in with her. According to a second-hand account, he overcame her resistance to him bringing other women in to live with them. Before long, they were sharing Brunner&#x27;s residence with eighteen other women.

Manson established himself as a guru in San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury district, which during 1967&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Love&quot; was emerging as the signature hippie locale. Manson may have borrowed some of his philosophy from the Process Church of the Final Judgment. Its members believed Satan would become reconciled to Jesus, and they would come together at the end of the world to judge humanity. Manson soon had the first of his groups of followers, most of them female. They were later dubbed the &quot;Manson Family&quot; by Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi and the media. Manson allegedly taught his followers that they were the reincarnation of the original Christians, and that the establishment could be characterized as the Romans. Sometime around 1967, he began using the alias &quot;Charles Willis Manson.&quot;

Before the end of summer, Manson and some of the women began traveling in an old school bus they had adapted, putting colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed. They eventually settled in the Los Angeles areas of Topanga Canyon, and Malibu and Venice along the coast.

In 1967, Brunner became pregnant by Manson. On April 15, 1968, she gave birth to their son, whom she named Valentine Michael, in a condemned house where they were living in Topanga Canyon. She was assisted by several of the young women from the Family. Brunner (like most members of the group) acquired a number of aliases and nicknames, including: &quot;Marioche&quot;, &quot;Och&quot;, &quot;Mother Mary&quot;, &quot;Mary Manson&quot;, &quot;Linda Dee Manson&quot;, and &quot;Christine Marie Euchts&quot;.

=== Manson&#x27;s self-presentation ===
Actor Al Lewis had Manson babysit his children on a couple of occasions and described him as &quot;a nice guy when I knew him&quot;. Music producer Phil Kaufman introduced Manson to Universal Studios producer Gary Stromberg, then working on a film adaptation of the life of Jesus set in modern America. It featured a Black Jesus and southern &quot;redneck Romans&quot;. Stromberg thought that Manson made interesting suggestions about what Jesus might do in a situation, seeming to be attuned to the role. He had one of his women kiss his feet and then kissed hers in return to demonstrate the place of women. At the beach one day, Stromberg watched while Manson preached against a materialistic outlook. One of his listeners questioned him about the well-furnished bus. Manson tossed the bus keys to the doubter, who promptly drove the bus away while Manson watched, apparently unconcerned. According to Stromberg, Manson had a dynamic personality; he was able to read a person&#x27;s emotional weaknesses and manipulate them. For example, Manson tried to manipulate Danny DeCarlo, the treasurer of the Straight Satans motorcycle club, by granting him &quot;access&quot; to Family women. He convinced DeCarlo that his large penis helped keep the women in the group.

=== Involvement with Wilson, Melcher, and others ===
Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys picked up Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey when they were hitchhiking in late spring 1968, while under the influence of alcohol and LSD. He took them to his Pacific Palisades house for a few hours. The following morning, when Wilson returned home from a night recording session, he was greeted by Manson in the driveway, who emerged from his house. Wilson asked the stranger whether he intended to hurt him. Manson assured him that he had no such intent and began kissing Wilson&#x27;s feet. Inside the house, Wilson discovered 12 strangers, mostly women.

The account given in &quot;Manson in His Own Words&quot; is that Manson first met Wilson at a friend&#x27;s San Francisco house where Manson had gone to obtain marijuana. Manson claimed that Wilson gave him his Sunset Boulevard address and invited him to stop by when he came to Los Angeles. Wilson said in a 1968 &quot;Record Mirror&quot; article that when he mentioned the Beach Boys&#x27; involvement with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi to a group of strange women, &quot;they told me they too had a guru, a guy named Charlie.&quot;

Over the next few months, the number of women doubled in Wilson&#x27;s house. He covered their costs, which amounted to approximately $100,000. This total included a large medical bill for treatment of their gonorrhea, and $21,000 for the destruction of his uninsured car, which they borrowed. Wilson would sing and talk with Manson, and they both treated the women as servants. Wilson paid for studio time to record songs written and performed by Manson and introduced him to entertainment business acquaintances, including Gregg Jakobson, Terry Melcher, and Rudi Altobelli. The latter man owned a house which he rented to actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski. Jakobson was impressed by &quot;the whole Charlie Manson package&quot; of artist, life-stylist, and philosopher, and he paid to record his material. Wilson moved out of his rented home when the lease expired, and his landlord evicted the Family.

=== Spahn Ranch ===
Manson established a base for the Family at the Spahn Ranch in August 1968 after Wilson&#x27;s landlord evicted them. It had been a television and movie set for Westerns, but the buildings had deteriorated by the late 1960s. The ranch then derived revenue primarily from selling horseback rides. Female Family members did chores around the ranch and, occasionally, had sex on Manson&#x27;s orders with the nearly blind 80-year-old owner George Spahn. The women also acted as guides for him. In exchange, Spahn allowed Manson and his group to live at the ranch for free. Lynette Fromme acquired the nickname &quot;Squeaky&quot; because she often squeaked when Spahn pinched her thigh.

Charles Watson, a small-town Texan who had quit college and moved to California, soon joined the group at the ranch.

== Encounter with Tate ==
On March 23, 1969, Manson entered the grounds of 10050 Cielo Drive, which he had known as Melcher&#x27;s residence. He was not invited.

As he approached the main house, Manson was met by Shahrokh Hatami, an Iranian photographer who had befriended Polanski and Tate during the making of the documentary &quot;Mia and Roman&quot;. He was there to photograph Tate before she departed for Rome the next day. Seeing Manson approach, Hatami had gone onto the front porch to ask him what he wanted. Manson said that he was looking for someone whose name Hatami did not recognize. Hatami told him the place was the Polanski residence. He advised Manson to try &quot;the back alley,&quot; by which he meant the path to the guest house beyond the main house. Concerned about the stranger, he had gone down the front walk to confront Manson. Tate appeared behind Hatami in the house&#x27;s front door and asked him who was calling. Hatami said that a man was looking for someone. He and Tate maintained their positions while Manson went back to the guest house without a word, returned to the front a minute or two later, and left.

That evening, Manson returned to the property and again went to the guest house. He entered the enclosed porch and spoke with Altobelli, the owner, who had just come out of the shower. Manson asked for Melcher, but Altobelli felt that Manson was looking for him. It was later discovered that Manson had apparently been to the property on earlier occasions after Melcher left.

Altobelli told Manson through the screen door that Melcher had moved to Malibu and said that he did not know his new address (although he did). Altobelli said that he was in the entertainment business. He had met Manson the previous year at Wilson&#x27;s home and was sure that Manson already knew that. At that meeting, he had given limited compliments to Manson on some of his musical recordings, which Wilson had been playing. Altobelli told Manson he was leaving the country the next day, and Manson said he would like to speak with him upon his return. Altobelli said that he would be gone for more than a year. Manson said that he had been directed to the guest house by the persons in the main house; Altobelli asked Manson not to disturb his tenants.

Altobelli and Tate flew together to Rome the next day. Tate asked him whether &quot;that creepy-looking guy&quot; had gone to see him at the guest house the day before.
== Crimes ==
=== Crowe shooting ===
}}

Tex Watson became involved in drug dealing and robbed a drug dealer named Bernard &quot;Lotsapoppa&quot; Crowe. Crowe allegedly responded with a threat to kill everyone at Spahn Ranch. In response, Charles Manson shot Crowe on July 1, 1969, at Manson&#x27;s Hollywood apartment.

Manson&#x27;s belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a Black Panther in Los Angeles. Although Crowe was not a member of the Black Panthers, Manson concluded he had been and expected retaliation from the Panthers. He turned Spahn Ranch into a defensive camp, establishing night patrols by armed guards. Tex Watson would later write, &quot;Blackie was trying to get at the chosen ones.&quot;

Manson brought in members of the Straight Satans Motorcycle Club to act as security. At this time, Bobby Beausoleil became more involved with the Family.

=== Hinman murder ===
Gary Allen Hinman (b. December 24, 1934 in Colorado) was a music teacher and PhD student at UCLA. At some point in the late 1960s, he befriended members of the Manson Family, allowing some to occasionally stay at his home. According to some people, including Family member Susan Atkins, Manson believed Hinman was wealthy. He sent Family members Bobby Beausoleil, Mary Brunner and Atkins to Hinman&#x27;s home on July 25, 1969, to convince him to join the Family and turn over the assets Manson thought Hinman had inherited. The three held Hinman hostage for two days, as he denied having any money. During this time, Manson arrived with a sword and slashed Hinman&#x27;s face and ear. After that, Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death, allegedly on Manson&#x27;s instruction. Before leaving the Topanga Canyon residence, Beausoleil or one of the women used Hinman&#x27;s blood to write &quot;Political piggy&quot; on the wall and to draw a panther paw, a Black Panther symbol.

According to Manson and Beausoleil in magazine interviews of 1981 and 1998–1999, Beausoleil said he went to Hinman&#x27;s to recover money paid to Hinman for mescaline provided to the Straight Satans that had supposedly been bad. Beausoleil added that Brunner and Atkins, unaware of his intent, went along to visit Hinman. Atkins, in her 1977 autobiography, wrote that Manson directed Beausoleil, Brunner, and her to go to Hinman&#x27;s and get the supposed inheritance of $21,000. She said that two days earlier Manson had told her privately that, if she wanted to &quot;do something important&quot;, she could kill Hinman and get his money.

Beausoleil was arrested on August 6, 1969, after he was caught driving Hinman&#x27;s car. Police found the murder weapon in the tire well.

===Murders of Tate, Sebring, Folger, Frykowski, and Parent===
On the night of August 8, 1969, Manson directed Tex Watson to take Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian, and Patricia Krenwinkel to Melcher&#x27;s former home at 10050 Cielo Drive in Los Angeles. According to Watson, Manson told them to kill everyone there. The home had recently been rented to actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski. (Polanski was away in Europe working on &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot;). Manson told the three women to do as Watson told them.

The Family members killed the five people they found: Sharon Tate (eight and a half months pregnant), who was living there at the time, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, and Wojciech Frykowski, who were visiting her, and Steven Parent, who had been visiting the caretaker of the home. Atkins wrote &quot;pig&quot; with Tate&#x27;s blood on the front door as they left. The murders created a nationwide sensation.

=== Murder of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca ===
The night of August 9, 1969, seven Family members (Leslie Van Houten, Steve &quot;Clem&quot; Grogan, Charles Manson, and the four from the previous night) drove to the home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Watson said that, having gone there alone, Manson returned to take him to the house with him. After Manson pointed through a window to a man sleeping in the living room, the two men entered the house through an unlocked back door. Watson bound the couple and covered their heads with pillowcases. Manson left, sending Krenwinkel and Van Houten into the house.

Watson sent the women to the bedroom where Rosemary had been bound. He began stabbing Leno with a bayonet in the living room. Going to the bedroom, Watson discovered Rosemary swinging a lamp at the Family women. He stabbed her with the bayonet, and returned to the living room to resume attacking Leno, whom he stabbed 12 times. Krenwinkel stabbed Rosemary. Watson told Van Houten to stab the woman, too, which she did. Krenwinkel used the LaBiancas&#x27; blood to write &quot;Rise&quot; and &quot;Death to pigs&quot; on the walls, and &quot;Healter Skelter&quot; on the refrigerator door.

Meanwhile, Manson directed Kasabian to drive to the home of an acquaintance of hers. Manson dropped off Kasabian, Grogan, and Atkins, and drove back to Spahn Ranch. Kasabian allegedly thwarted a murder by deliberately knocking on the wrong door.

=== Shea murder ===
In a 1971 trial that took place after his Tate–LaBianca convictions, Manson was found guilty of the murders of Gary Hinman and Donald &quot;Shorty&quot; Shea. He was given a life sentence. Shea was a Spahn Ranch stuntman and horse wrangler who had been killed approximately ten days after a sheriff&#x27;s raid on the ranch which had been carried out on 16 August 1969. Manson, who suspected that Shea had helped set up the raid, apparently believed Shea was trying to get Spahn to run the Family off the ranch. Manson may have considered it a &quot;sin&quot; that Shea, a white man, had married a black woman. Furthermore, there was the possibility that Shea knew about the Tate–LaBianca killings. In separate trials, Family members Bruce Davis and Steve &quot;Clem&quot; Grogan were also found guilty of Shea&#x27;s murder.

In 1977, authorities learned the exact location of the remains of Shorty Shea and, contrary to Family claims, also learned that Shea had not been dismembered and buried in several places. Contacting the prosecutor in his case, Steve Grogan told him Shea&#x27;s corpse had been buried intact. Grogan drew a map that pinpointed the location, and the body was recovered. Of those convicted of Manson-ordered murders, Grogan would become, in 1985, the first one to be paroled.

===Suspected further murders===
In total, Manson and his followers were convicted of nine counts of first-degree murder. However, the LAPD believes that the Family could have claimed up to at least twelve more victims. Cliff Shepard, a former LAPD Robbery-Homicide Division detective, said that Manson &quot;repeatedly&quot; claimed to have killed many others. Prosecutor Stephen Kay supported this assertion: &quot;I know that Manson one time told one of his cellmates that he was responsible for 35 murders.&quot; Tate&#x27;s younger sister, Debra Tate, has also claimed that investigators are &quot;just scraping the surface&quot; when it comes to the number of Manson&#x27;s victims and has further elaborated on how Manson sent her a taunting map of the Panamint Range, with crosses on it that she believed were meant to represent buried bodies. This has resulted in several excavations that have been undertaken at Manson&#x27;s Barker Ranch, but they have not resulted in any bodies being found. 
* Nancy Warren, 65, and Clyda Dulaney, 24, were both found near Ukiah, California at the antique store owned by Warren on October 13, 1968. They had both been beaten and strangled to death with thirty-six leather thongs. After the Family members were arrested, they became suspects when it was discovered that members of the Family had been in the Ukiah area at the time of the murders. However, no one in the Family was ever charged with the murders and no arrests were ever made in the case.
* Marina Elizabeth Habe, 17, was murdered on December 30, 1968. She was a student at the University of Hawaii home on vacation when she was murdered in Los Angeles. According to the autopsy report, Habe&#x27;s throat had been slashed and she had received numerous knife wounds to the chest. She suffered multiple contusions to the face and throat, and had been garrotted. There was no evidence of rape. Habe was abducted outside the home of her mother in West Hollywood, 8962 Cynthia Avenue. A former Manson Family associate claimed members of the Family had known Habe and it was conjectured she had been one of their victims.
* Darwin Morell Scott, 64, was the uncle of Manson and the brother of Manson&#x27;s father, Colonel Scott. On May 27, 1969, Scott was found brutally stabbed to death in his Ashland, Kentucky apartment. His body was pinned to the kitchen floor with a butcher knife, and he had been stabbed nineteen times. After Manson&#x27;s arrest, it was reported that local residents claimed to have seen a man resembling Manson using the alias, &quot;Preacher&quot;, in the area at the time Darwin was murdered. Manson was on parole in California at the time of the murder, but the murder occurred when Manson was out of touch with his parole officers.
* Mark Walts, 16, was an acquaintance of the Family members and was even known to associate with them at the Spahn Ranch. On July 17, 1969, Walts hitchhiked to the Santa Monica Pier so he could go fishing. His fishing pole was found abandoned at the pier, and his body was found the next day near Mulholland Drive. He had been shot three times in the chest. Though the Family was reportedly &quot;shocked&quot; by Walts&#x27; murder, his brother was convinced that Manson was responsible for his death and even called him in order to directly accuse him of his murder. The Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department investigated Spahn Ranch in regard to Walts&#x27; murder, but no links were found, and the murder was never solved.
* John Philip Haught, 22, was an Ohio native who had moved to California and met Manson in the summer of 1969. He joined the Manson Family and was amongst the group who was arrested in the October raid of the clan for the Tate-LaBianca murders; Manson suspected him of being an informant. On November 5, 1969, Haught was associating with some members of the Family. According to all present, Haught suddenly found a gun in the room, picked it up, and promptly shot himself while attempting a game of Russian roulette. However, when police investigated the death, they found that the gun, rather than having zero bullets and one spent shell casing, instead contained seven bullets and one spent shell. Moreover, the gun had been wiped free of prints. Additionally, a male witness who had held Haught&#x27;s head after the shooting told Cohen he had entered the room to find a female Manson follower with the gun in her hand. Despite this, police concluded Haught had actually killed himself.
* James Sharp, 15, and Doreen Gaul, 19, were both found stabbed to death in an alley in Los Angeles on November 7, 1969. The murder of the two young Scientologists involved both being stabbed between fifty and sixty times. Police immediately noted the similarities to these murders and those of the Tate-LaBianca murders; the killings of Sharp and Gaul happened close to where the Labianca&#x27;s lived. In &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, author Vincent Bugliosi wrote that Gaul was rumoured to be a former girlfriend of Manson Family member Bruce Davis — Davis had lived at the same housing complex as Gaul, but in a police interview he denied knowing her.
* Reet Jurvetson, 19, was a young woman found stabbed to death on November 16, 1969. Her body was found with over one hundred and fifty stab wounds from a penknife to her neck and upper body, along with defensive wounds on her hands and arms. She had been disposed of along Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles, California. Some witnesses claimed to have seen a woman named &quot;Sherry&quot; who matched Jurvetson&#x27;s description among members of the Manson Family, but it turned out that this individual was alive. Manson himself denied any involvement in killing Jurvetson. Detectives within the Los Angeles Police Department have noted &quot;striking similarities&quot; between the method of murder of both Jurvetson and Habe, but no firm connection between both murders has ever been established.
* Joel Pugh, 29, was found dead in the Talgarth Hotel in London, England, on December 1, 1969. His wrists had been cut and his throat was slit twice. British authorities listed the death a drug-induced suicide, saying Pugh had been depressed. Pugh was a Family member who was married to another member of the Family, Sandra Good. Stephen Kay and others claim Manson hated Pugh. &quot;He had no reason to commit suicide, and Manson was very unhappy that Sandy was with Pugh&quot;, Kay has said. Pugh&#x27;s death occurred when a number of Manson Family members were being arrested for the Tate-LaBianca murders. Manson follower Bruce Davis was in London at the time Pugh died.
* Ronald Hughes, 35, was an American attorney who represented Leslie Van Houten, a member of the Manson Family. Hughes disappeared while on a camping trip during a ten-day recess from the Tate-LaBianca murder trial in November 1970. The badly decomposed body of Hughes was found in March 1971 wedged between two boulders in Ventura County. It was rumoured, although never proven, that Hughes was murdered by the Family, possibly because he had stood up to Manson and refused to allow Van Houten to take the stand and absolve Manson of the crimes, though he might have perished in flooding. Attorney Stephen Kay has stated that while he is &quot;on the fence&quot; about the Family&#x27;s involvement in Hughes&#x27; death, Manson had open contempt for Hughes during the trial. Kay added, &quot;The last thing Manson said to him [Hughes] was, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to see you in the courtroom again,&#x27; and he was never seen again alive.&quot; Family member Sandra Good stated that Hughes was &quot;the first of the retaliation murders&quot;.
* On November 8, 1972, the body of 26-year-old Vietnam Marine combat veteran James Lambert Willett was found by a hiker near Guerneville, California. Months earlier, he had been forced to dig his own grave, and then was shot and poorly buried. His station wagon was found outside a house in Stockton where several Manson followers were living, including Priscilla Cooper, Lynette Fromme, and Nancy Pitman. Police forced their way into the house and arrested several of the people there. The body of Willett&#x27;s 19-year-old wife Lauren Chavelle Willett was found buried in the basement. She had been killed very recently by a gunshot to the head, in what the Family members initially claimed was an accident. It was later suggested that she was killed out of fear that she would reveal who killed her husband. Michael Monfort pleaded guilty to murdering Lauren and Priscilla Cooper, James Craig, and Nancy Pitman pleaded guilty as accessories after the fact. Monfort and William Goucher later pleaded guilty to the murder of James, and James Craig pleaded guilty as an accessory after the fact. The group had been living in the house with the Willetts while committing various robberies. Shortly after killing Willett, Monfort had used Willett&#x27;s identification papers to pose as Willett after being arrested for an armed robbery of a liquor store. Willett was not involved in the robberies and wanted to move away but was presumably killed out of fear that he would talk to police.
* Laurence Merrick, 50, was an American film director and author. He is best known for co-directing the Oscar nominated documentary Manson in 1973. Sharon Tate was a former student at Merrick&#x27;s Academy of Dramatic Arts. Merrick was killed by a gunman on January 26, 1977. He was shot in the back in the carpark of his acting school. Merrick&#x27;s murder went unsolved until October 1981 when 35-year-old Dennis Mignano confessed to police. At his subsequent trial, Mignano was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a mental hospital. Mignano was an unemployed would-be actor and singer with a long history of psychiatric problems and a possible prior relationship with the Manson clan.
* Six months after the murder of Merrick, Mignano&#x27;s sister Michele Mignano, 21, a topless dancer, was also murdered. Her body was found on June 13, 1977, 350 ft into a Western Pacific railroad tunnel in Niles Canyon. Authorities referred to her death as an &quot;execution-style slaying&quot; with her dying from exsanguination due to multiple gunshot wounds. A number of bullet cartridges were found near her body. She was shoeless yet fully clothed with jewellery so sexual assault and robbery were both ruled out as motives. Her murder has never been solved.

=== Possible murder motives ===
==== Helter Skelter ====
In November 1968, the Family had established headquarters in Death Valley&#x27;s environs, at the Myers and Barker ranches. The former was owned by the grandmother of Family member Catherine Gillies.

According to Charles Watson and Paul Watkins, Manson and Watson visited an acquaintance who played the Beatles&#x27; double album, &quot;The Beatles&quot;, and became obsessed with the group.

Watkins claimed Manson had been saying that racial tensions between Blacks and Whites were about to erupt, predicted that Black Americans would rise up in rebellion, and that The Beatles&#x27; songs foretold it all in code.

According to Watkins, by February, the Family would create an album whose songs would trigger the predicted chaos. Murders of Whites by Blacks would be met with retaliation. A split between racist and non-racist Whites would result in the Whites&#x27; self-annihilation.

==== Copycat ====
According to Family members Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, Bobby Beausoleil, and others, the arrest of Beausoleil for the torture and murder of Gary Hinman was the catalyst for the Family&#x27;s ensuing murder spree. They wanted to convince police that the killer(s) of Hinman were still at large. Truman Capote&#x27;s interviews of Beausoleil, and that by Ann Louise Bardach in November 1981, affirmed this account.

Charlie Guenther, a police detective who investigated the murders, said of Beausoleil, &quot;He called the [Spahn] Ranch after he was arrested. The sole motive for those murders was to get Bobby out of jail.&quot; Bugliosi&#x27;s co-prosecutor Aaron Stovitz said he believed the motive for the Tate–LaBianca murders was as copycat murders after Hinman.

==== Drugs ====
Other people suggested the motive was related to the drug dealing by Jay Sebring and Voytek Frykowski, and their connection with Charles Watson and Manson, and a bad drug deal. For instance, Sebring&#x27;s protégé Jim Markham believes the murders were in response to a bad drug deal the day before, in which Manson went to Tate&#x27;s house to sell marijuana and cocaine to Sebring and Frykowski. Instead, the two men attacked and beat Manson. In an interview with police, Frykowski&#x27;s friend Witold Kaczanowski said that Frykowski had been involved with many criminals and the drug trade. In his later interview with Truman Capote, Bobby Beausoleil said, &quot;They burned people on dope deals. Sharon Tate and that gang.&quot;

Ed Sanders and Paul Krassner uncovered information that Joel Rostau, the boyfriend of Sebring&#x27;s receptionist, had delivered mescaline and cocaine to Sebring and Frykowski at Tate&#x27;s house a few hours before the murders. During the Manson trial, Rostau and other associates of Sebring were murdered.

==== Terry Melcher ====
In 1968, musician Dennis Wilson introduced record producer Terry Melcher to Manson. For a time, Melcher was interested in recording Manson&#x27;s music, as well as making a film about the family and their hippie commune existence. Manson met Melcher at 10050 Cielo Drive, a house that Melcher shared with his girlfriend, actress Candice Bergen, and musician Mark Lindsay.

Manson eventually auditioned for Melcher, but Melcher declined to sign him. There was still talk of a documentary being made about Manson&#x27;s music, but Melcher abandoned the project after witnessing Manson fighting with a drunken stuntman at Spahn Ranch. Wilson and Melcher severed their ties with Manson, a move that angered Manson. Soon after, Melcher and Bergen moved out of the Cielo Drive home. The house&#x27;s owner, Rudi Altobelli, then leased it to film director Roman Polanski and his wife, actress Sharon Tate. Manson was reported to have visited the house on more than one occasion asking for Melcher, but was told that Melcher had moved.

Some authors and law enforcement personnel have theorized that the Cielo Drive house was targeted by Manson as revenge for Melcher&#x27;s rejection and that Manson was unaware that he and Bergen had moved out. However, family member Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson stated that Manson and company did, in fact, know that Melcher was no longer living there, and Melcher&#x27;s former roommate Mark Lindsay stated, &quot;Terry and I talked about it later and Terry said Manson knew (Melcher had moved) because Manson or someone from his organization left a note on Terry&#x27;s porch in Malibu.&quot;

The Manson murders reportedly prompted Melcher to go into seclusion. When Manson was arrested, it was widely reported that he had sent his followers to the house to kill Melcher and Bergen. Manson family member Susan Atkins, who admitted her part in the murders, stated to police and before a grand jury that the house was chosen as the scene for the murders &quot;to instill fear into Terry Melcher because Terry had given us his word on a few things and never came through with them&quot;. Melcher took to employing a bodyguard and told Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi that his fear was so great he had been undergoing psychiatric treatment. Melcher was described as the most frightened of the witnesses at the trial, even though Bugliosi assured him that &quot;Manson knew you were no longer living [on Cielo Drive]&quot;.

In his 2019 book &quot;&quot;, Tom O&#x27;Neil reexamined the Manson case and found evidence Melcher may have been more closely involved with the Manson family than he admitted at trial. In reviewing police files and other data, O&#x27;Neill found evidence Melcher was associating with Manson in the four month period after the Tate-Labianca murders but before Manson&#x27;s arrest. These documents, seemingly hidden by Bugliosi, undermined claims the Tate murders were intended to frighten Melcher in revenge for his refusal to record Manson&#x27;s music. O&#x27;Neill also found documents indicating Melcher was having sex with 15-year-old Manson family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse. Dean Moorehouse, Ruth Ann&#x27;s father and a Manson Family member, also had resided at 10050 Cielo Drive with Melcher. Tex Watson would also frequently visit the residence.

== Investigation and trial ==
=== Investigation ===
The Tate murders became national news on August 9, 1969. The Polanskis&#x27; housekeeper, Winifred Chapman, had discovered the murder scene when she arrived for work that morning. On August 10, detectives of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, which had jurisdiction in the Hinman case, informed Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detectives assigned to the Tate case of the bloody writing at the Hinman house. According to Vincent Bugliosi, because detectives believed the Tate murders were a consequence of a drug transaction, the Tate team initially ignored this and other evidence of similarities between the crimes. The Tate autopsies were underway before the LaBianca bodies were discovered.

During the Tate autopsies, detectives working on the Gary Hinman case noticed similarities in the weapons used, the stab wounds, and the writing in blood on the walls. They also thought the case had something to do with narcotics. They brought the information to detectives working on the Tate murders. According to Detective Charlie Guenther, &quot;Vince [Bugliosi] didn&#x27;t want anything to do with the Hinman case. Hinman was a nothing case. Vince didn&#x27;t want to prosecute it.&quot;

Steven Parent, who was fatally shot in the Tate/Polanski driveway, was found to have been an acquaintance of William Garretson, the caretaker who lived in the guest house. Garretson had been hired by Rudi Altobelli to take care of the property while Altobelli was away. The killers encountered Parent when he was leaving after he had visited Garretson.

Held briefly as a Tate suspect, Garretson told police he had neither seen nor heard anything on the murder night. He was released on August 11, 1969, after undergoing a polygraph examination that indicated he had not been involved in the crimes.

The LaBianca crime scene was discovered at about 10:30 p.m. on August 10, approximately 19 hours after the murders were committed. Fifteen-year-old Frank Struthers, Rosemary&#x27;s son from a prior marriage and Leno&#x27;s stepson, returned from a camping trip and was concerned to see all of the window shades of his home drawn and his stepfather&#x27;s speedboat still attached to the family car, parked in the driveway. He called his older sister and her boyfriend. The boyfriend, Joe Dorgan, accompanied the younger Struthers into the house, where they discovered Leno&#x27;s body. They called the police, who found Rosemary&#x27;s body after officers arrived at the house.

On August 12, 1969, the LAPD told the press it had ruled out any connection between the Tate and LaBianca homicides. On August 16, the sheriff&#x27;s office raided Spahn Ranch and arrested Manson and 25 others, as &quot;suspects in a major auto theft ring&quot; that had been stealing Volkswagen Beetles and converting them into dune buggies. Weapons were seized, but, because the search warrant had been misdated, the group was released a few days later.

In a report at the end of August, the LaBianca detectives noted a possible connection between the bloody writings at the LaBianca house and &quot;the singing group the Beatles&#x27; most recent album.&quot;

==== Breakthrough ====
Still working separately from the Tate team, the LaBianca team checked with the sheriff&#x27;s office in mid-October about possible similar crimes. They learned of the Hinman case. They also learned that the Hinman detectives had spoken with Beausoleil&#x27;s girlfriend, Kitty Lutesinger. She had been arrested a few days earlier with members of &quot;the Manson Family&quot;.

The arrests, for car thefts, had taken place at the desert ranches to which the Family had moved. Unknown to authorities, its members had been searching Death Valley for a hole in the ground, what they believed was access to the Bottomless Pit. A joint force of National Park Service Rangers and officers from the California Highway Patrol and the Inyo County Sheriff&#x27;s Office: federal, state, and county personnel, had raided both the Myers and Barker ranches after following evidence left when Family members had burned an earthmover owned by Death Valley National Monument. The raiders had found stolen dune buggies and other vehicles, and had arrested two dozen people, including Manson. A Highway Patrol officer found Manson hiding in a cabinet beneath Barker&#x27;s bathroom sink. The officers had no idea that the people they were arresting were involved with the murders in Los Angeles.

Following up leads a month after they had spoken with Lutesinger, LaBianca detectives contacted members of a motorcycle gang Manson tried to recruit as bodyguards while the Family was at Spahn Ranch. While the gang members were providing information that suggested a link between Manson and the Tate/LaBianca murders, a dormitory mate of Susan Atkins informed LAPD of the Family&#x27;s involvement in the crimes. Atkins was booked for the Hinman murder after she told sheriff&#x27;s detectives that she had been involved in it. Transferred to Sybil Brand Institute, a detention center in Monterey Park, California, she had begun talking to bunkmates Ronnie Howard and Virginia Graham, to whom she gave accounts of the events in which she had been involved.

==== Apprehension ====
On December 1, 1969, acting on the information from these sources, LAPD announced warrants for the arrest of Watson, Krenwinkel, and Kasabian in the Tate case; the suspects&#x27; involvement in the LaBianca murders was noted. Manson and Atkins, already in custody, were not mentioned; the connection between the LaBianca case and Van Houten, who was also among those arrested near Death Valley, had not yet been recognized.

Watson and Krenwinkel were already under arrest, with authorities in McKinney, Texas and Mobile, Alabama having picked them up on notice from LAPD. Informed that a warrant was out for her arrest, Kasabian voluntarily surrendered to authorities in Concord, New Hampshire on December 2.

Before long, physical evidence such as Krenwinkel&#x27;s and Watson&#x27;s fingerprints, which had been collected by LAPD at Cielo Drive, was augmented by evidence recovered by the public. On September 1, 1969, the distinctive .22-caliber Hi Standard &quot;Buntline Special&quot; revolver Watson used on Parent, Sebring, and Frykowski had been found and given to the police by Steven Weiss, a 10-year-old who lived near the Tate residence. In mid-December, when the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published a crime account based on information Susan Atkins had given her attorney, Weiss&#x27;s father made several phone calls which finally prompted LAPD to locate the gun in its evidence file and connect it with the murders via ballistics tests.

Acting on that same newspaper account, a local ABC television crew quickly located and recovered the bloody clothing discarded by the Tate killers. The knives discarded en route from the Tate residence were never recovered, despite a search by some of the same crewmen and months later by LAPD. A knife found behind the cushion of a chair in the Tate living room was apparently that of Susan Atkins, who lost her knife in the course of the attack.

=== Trial ===
The trial began June 15, 1970. The prosecution&#x27;s main witness was Kasabian, who along with Manson, Atkins, and Krenwinkel had been charged with seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Since Kasabian, by all accounts, had not participated in the killings, she was granted immunity in exchange for testimony that detailed the nights of the crimes. Originally, a deal had been made with Atkins in which the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty against her in exchange for her grand jury testimony on which the indictments were secured; once Atkins repudiated that testimony, the deal was withdrawn. Because Van Houten had participated only in the LaBianca killings, she was charged with two counts of murder and one of conspiracy.

Originally, Judge William Keene had reluctantly granted Manson permission to act as his own attorney. Because of Manson&#x27;s conduct, including violations of a gag order and submission of &quot;outlandish&quot; and &quot;nonsensical&quot; pretrial motions, the permission was withdrawn before the trial&#x27;s start. Manson filed an affidavit of prejudice against Keene, who was replaced by Judge Charles Older. On Friday, July 24, the first day of testimony, Manson appeared in court with an X carved into his forehead. He issued a statement that he was &quot;considered inadequate and incompetent to speak or defend [him]self&quot;—and had &quot;X&#x27;d [him]self from [the establishment&#x27;s] world.&quot; Over the following weekend, the female defendants duplicated the mark on their own foreheads, as did most Family members within another day or so.

The prosecution argued that triggering the &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; scenario was Manson&#x27;s main motive. Present at the crime scene were the words &quot;PIGS&quot; and &quot;HEALTER SKELTER&quot; written in blood by Susan Atkins, a reference to the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; from their 1968 album. These messages correlated with testimony about Manson&#x27;s predictions that Black people would murder white people and write similar warnings in blood at the outset of Helter Skelter. The defendants testified that the writing on the walls was to imitate the Hinman murder scene, not an apocalyptic race war.

According to Bugliosi, Manson directed Kasabian to hide a wallet taken from the scene in the women&#x27;s restroom of a service station near a Black neighborhood. However, as co-prosecutor Stephen Kay later pointed out the wallet was actually left about 20 miles away in a predominantly White neighborhood, Sylmar.

==== Ongoing disruptions ====
During the trial, Family members loitered near the entrances and corridors of the courthouse. To keep them out of the courtroom proper, the prosecution subpoenaed them as prospective witnesses, who would not be able to enter while others were testifying. When the group established itself in vigil on the sidewalk, some members wore sheathed hunting knives that, although in plain view, were carried legally. Each of them was also identifiable by the X on their forehead.

Some Family members attempted to dissuade witnesses from testifying. Prosecution witnesses Paul Watkins and Juan Flynn were both threatened; Watkins was badly burned in a suspicious fire in his van. Former Family member Barbara Hoyt, who had overheard Susan Atkins describing the Tate murders to Family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse, agreed to accompany the latter to Hawaii. There, Moorehouse allegedly gave her a hamburger spiked with several doses of LSD. Found sprawled on a Honolulu curb in a drugged semi-stupor, Hoyt was taken to the hospital, where she did her best to identify herself as a witness in the Tate–LaBianca murder trial. Before the incident, Hoyt had been a reluctant witness; after the attempt to silence her, her reticence disappeared.

On August 4, despite precautions taken by the court, Manson flashed the jury a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; front page whose headline was &quot;Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares&quot;. This was a reference to a statement made the previous day when U.S. President Richard Nixon had decried what he saw as the media&#x27;s glamorization of Manson. Voir dired by Judge Charles Older, the jurors contended that the headline had not influenced them. The next day, the female defendants stood up and said in unison that, in light of Nixon&#x27;s remark, there was no point in going on with the trial.

On October 5, Manson was denied the court&#x27;s permission to question a prosecution witness whom defense attorneys had declined to cross-examine. Leaping over the defense table, Manson attempted to attack the judge. Wrestled to the ground by bailiffs, he was removed from the courtroom with the female defendants, who had subsequently risen and begun chanting in Latin. Thereafter, Older allegedly began wearing a revolver under his robes.

==== Defense rests ====
On November 16, the prosecution rested its case. Three days later, after arguing standard dismissal motions, the defense stunned the court by resting as well, without calling a single witness. Shouting their disapproval, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten demanded their right to testify.

In chambers, the women&#x27;s lawyers told the judge their clients wanted to testify that they had planned and committed the crimes and that Manson had not been involved. By resting their case, the defense lawyers had tried to stop this; Van Houten&#x27;s attorney, Ronald Hughes, vehemently stated that he would not &quot;push a client out the window&quot;. In the prosecutor&#x27;s view, it was Manson who was advising the women to testify in this way as a means of saving himself. Speaking about the trial in a 1987 documentary, Krenwinkel said, &quot;The entire proceedings were scripted—by Charlie.&quot;

The next day, Manson testified. The jury was removed from the courtroom. According to Vincent Bugliosi it was to make sure Manson&#x27;s address did not violate the California Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;People v. Aranda&quot; by making statements implicating his co-defendants. However, Bugliosi argued Manson would use his hypnotic powers to unfairly influence the jury. Speaking for more than an hour, Manson said, among other things, that &quot;the music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment.&quot; He said, &quot;Why blame it on me? I didn&#x27;t write the music.&quot; &quot;To be honest with you,&quot; Manson also stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t recall ever saying &#x27;Get a knife and a change of clothes and go do what Tex says.

As the body of the trial concluded and with the closing arguments impending, defense attorney Hughes disappeared during a weekend trip. When Maxwell Keith was appointed to represent Van Houten in Hughes&#x27; absence, a delay of more than two weeks was required to permit Keith to familiarize himself with the voluminous trial transcripts. No sooner had the trial resumed, just before Christmas, than disruptions of the prosecution&#x27;s closing argument by the defendants led Older to ban the four defendants from the courtroom for the remainder of the guilt phase. This may have occurred because the defendants were acting in collusion with each other and were simply putting on a performance, which Older said was becoming obvious.

==== Conviction and penalty phase ====
On January 25, 1971, the jury returned guilty verdicts against the four defendants on each of the 27 separate counts against them. Not far into the trial&#x27;s penalty phase, the jurors saw, at last, the defense that Manson—in the prosecution&#x27;s view—had planned to present. Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten testified the murders had been conceived as &quot;copycat&quot; versions of the Hinman murder, for which Atkins now took credit. The killings, they said, were intended to draw suspicion away from Bobby Beausoleil by resembling the crime for which he had been jailed. This plan had supposedly been the work of, and carried out under the guidance of, not Manson, but someone allegedly in love with Beausoleil—Linda Kasabian. Among the narrative&#x27;s weak points was the inability of Atkins to explain why, as she was maintaining, she had written &quot;political piggy&quot; at the Hinman house in the first place.

Midway through the penalty phase, Manson shaved his head and trimmed his beard to a fork; he told the press, &quot;I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head.&quot; In what the prosecution regarded as belated recognition on their part that imitation of Manson only proved his domination, the female defendants refrained from shaving their heads until the jurors retired to weigh the state&#x27;s request for the death penalty.

The effort to exonerate Manson via the &quot;copycat&quot; scenario failed. On March 29, 1971, the jury returned verdicts of death against all four defendants on all counts. On April 19, 1971, Judge Older sentenced the four to death.

== Aftermath ==
===1970s–1980s===
Watson returned to McKinney, Texas after the Tate–LaBianca murders. He was arrested in Texas on November 30, 1969, after local police were notified by California investigators that his fingerprints were found to match a print found on the front door of the Tate home. Watson fought extradition to California long enough that he was not included among the three defendants tried with Manson. The trial commenced in August 1971; by October, he, too, had been found guilty on seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Unlike the others, Watson presented a psychiatric defense; prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi made short work of Watson&#x27;s insanity claims. Like his co-conspirators, Watson was sentenced to death.

In February 1972, the death sentences of all five parties were automatically reduced to life in prison by &quot;People v. Anderson&quot;, 493 P.2d 880, 6 Cal. 3d 628 (Cal. 1972), in which the California Supreme Court abolished the death penalty in that state. After his return to prison, Manson&#x27;s rhetoric and hippie speeches held little sway. Though he found temporary acceptance from the Aryan Brotherhood, his role was submissive to a sexually aggressive member of the group at San Quentin.

Before the conclusion of Manson&#x27;s Tate–LaBianca trial, a reporter for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; tracked down Manson&#x27;s mother, remarried and living in the Pacific Northwest. The former Kathleen Maddox claimed that, in childhood, her son had suffered no neglect; he had even been &quot;pampered by all the women who surrounded him&quot;.

==== Remaining in view ====

On September 5, 1975, the Family returned to national attention when Squeaky Fromme attempted to assassinate U.S. President Gerald Ford. The attempt took place in Sacramento, to which she and fellow Manson follower Sandra Good had moved so that they could be near Manson while he was incarcerated at Folsom State Prison. A subsequent search of the apartment shared by Fromme, Good, and another Family recruit turned up evidence that, coupled with later actions on the part of Good, resulted in Good&#x27;s conviction for conspiring to send threatening communications through the United States mail service and for transmitting death threats by way of interstate commerce. The threats involved corporate executives and U.S. government officials vis-à-vis supposed environmental dereliction on their part. Fromme was sentenced to 15 years to life, becoming the first person sentenced under United States Code Title 18, chapter 84 (1965), which made it a Federal crime to attempt to assassinate the President of the United States.

In December 1987, Fromme, serving a life sentence for the assassination attempt, escaped briefly from Federal Prison Camp, Alderson in West Virginia. She was trying to reach Manson because she heard that he had testicular cancer; she was apprehended within days. She was released on parole from Federal Medical Center, Carswell on August 14, 2009.

===1980–present===
Steve &quot;Clem&quot; Grogan, was paroled in 1985.

In a 1994 conversation with Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, Catherine Share, a one-time Manson follower, stated that her testimony in the penalty phase of Manson&#x27;s trial had been a fabrication intended to save Manson from the gas chamber and that it had been given under Manson&#x27;s explicit direction. Share&#x27;s testimony had introduced the copycat-motive story, which the testimony of the three female defendants echoed and according to which the Tate–LaBianca murders had been Linda Kasabian&#x27;s idea. In a 1997 segment of the tabloid television program &quot;Hard Copy&quot;, Share implied that her testimony had been given under a Manson threat of physical harm. In August 1971, after Manson&#x27;s trial and sentencing, Share had participated in a violent California retail store robbery, the object of which was the acquisition of weapons to help free Manson.

In January 1996, a Manson website was established by latter-day Manson follower George Stimson, who was helped by Sandra Good. Good had been released from prison in 1985, after serving 10 years of her 15-year sentence for the death threats.

In a 1998–1999 interview in &quot;Seconds&quot; magazine, Bobby Beausoleil rejected the view that Manson ordered him to kill Gary Hinman. He stated that Manson did come to Hinman&#x27;s house and slash Hinman with a sword, which he had previously denied in a 1981 interview with &quot;Oui&quot; magazine. Beausoleil stated that when he read about the Tate murders in the newspaper, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t even sure at that point—really, I had no idea who had done it until Manson&#x27;s group were actually arrested for it. It had only crossed my mind and I had a premonition, perhaps. There was some little tickle in my mind that the killings might be connected with them ...&quot; In the &quot;Oui&quot; magazine interview, he had stated, &quot;When the Tate–LaBianca murders happened, I knew who had done it. I was fairly certain.&quot;

William Garretson, once the young caretaker at 10050 Cielo Drive, indicated in a program (&quot;The Last Days of Sharon Tate&quot;) broadcast on July 25, 1999 on &quot;E!&quot;, that he had, in fact, seen and heard a portion of the Tate murders from his location in the property&#x27;s guest house. This corroborated the unofficial results of the polygraph examination that had been given to Garretson on August 10, 1969, and that had effectively eliminated him as a suspect. The LAPD officer who conducted the examination had concluded Garretson was &quot;clean&quot; on participation in the crimes but &quot;muddy&quot; as to his having heard anything.

It was announced in early 2008 that Susan Atkins was suffering from brain cancer. An application for compassionate release, based on her health status, was denied in July 2008, and she was denied parole for the 18th and final time on September 2, 2009. Atkins died of natural causes 22 days later, on September 24, 2009, at the Central California Women&#x27;s facility in Chowchilla.

In a January 2008 segment of the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Most Evil&quot;, Barbara Hoyt said that the impression that she had accompanied Ruth Ann Moorehouse to Hawaii just to avoid testifying at Manson&#x27;s trial was erroneous. Hoyt said she had cooperated with the Family because she was &quot;trying to keep them from killing my family&quot;. She stated that, at the time of the trial, she was &quot;constantly being threatened: &#x27;Your family&#x27;s gonna die. [The murders] could be repeated at your house.

On March 15, 2008, the Associated Press reported that forensic investigators had conducted a search for human remains at Barker Ranch the previous month. Following up on longstanding rumors that the Family had killed hitchhikers and runaways who had come into its orbit during its time at Barker, the investigators identified &quot;two likely clandestine grave sites ... and one additional site that merits further investigation.&quot; Though they recommended digging, CNN reported on March 28 that the Inyo County sheriff, who questioned the methods they employed with search dogs, had ordered additional tests before any excavation. On May 9, after a delay caused by damage to test equipment, the sheriff announced that test results had been inconclusive and that &quot;exploratory excavation&quot; would begin on May 20. In the meantime, Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson had commented publicly that &quot;no one was killed&quot; at the desert camp during the month and a half he was there, after the Tate–LaBianca murders. On May 21, after two days of work, the sheriff brought the search to an end; four potential gravesites had been dug up and had been found to hold no human remains.

In September 2009, The History Channel broadcast a docudrama covering the Family&#x27;s activities and the murders as part of its coverage on the 40th anniversary of the killings. The program included an in-depth interview with Linda Kasabian, who spoke publicly for the first time since a 1989 appearance on &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, an American television news magazine. Also included in the History Channel program were interviews with Vincent Bugliosi, Catherine Share, and Debra Tate, sister of Sharon.

As the 40th anniversary of the Tate–LaBianca murders approached, in July 2009, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; magazine published an &quot;oral history&quot; in which former Family members, law enforcement officers, and others involved with Manson, the arrests, and the trials offered their recollections of—and observations on—the events that made Manson notorious. In the article, Juan Flynn, a Spahn Ranch worker who had become associated with Manson and the Family, said, &quot;Charles Manson got away with everything. People will say, &#x27;He&#x27;s in jail.&#x27; But Charlie is exactly where he wants to be.&quot;

Charles Manson died of a heart attack and complications from colon cancer on November 19, 2017. He was 83 years old.

Bobby Beausolei was recommended parole by the California Board of Parole in 2019, at his nineteenth hearing, California Governor Gavin Newsom denied parole.

Leslie Van Houten was released on parole on July 11, 2023, at the age of 73.

<text>Vic Damone (born Vito Rocco Farinola; June 12, 1928 – February 11, 2018) was an American traditional pop and big band singer and actor. He was best known for his performances of songs such as the number one hit &quot;You&#x27;re Breaking My Heart&quot;, and other hits such as &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; (from &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;) and &quot;I Have But One Heart&quot;.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
He was born June 12, 1928 in Brooklyn, NY to Rocco and Domenica (Damone) Farinola. When his father was injured at work, Damone had to drop out of Lafayette High School. He worked as an usher and elevator operator at the Paramount Theater in Manhattan.

===Career===
Damone met Perry Como while at the Paramount Theater. Damone stopped the elevator between floors and sang for him. Como was impressed and referred him to a friend for an audition.

He began his career at the New York radio station WHN when he was 17, singing on the &quot;Gloom Dodgers&quot; show, which provided light entertainment to fans of the Brooklyn Dodgers. He changed his name (using his mother&#x27;s maiden name) at the suggestion of a regular on the show, comedian Morey Amsterdam.

Damone entered the talent search on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; and won in April 1947. This led to his becoming a regular on Godfrey&#x27;s show. He met Milton Berle at the studio and Berle got him work at two night clubs. By mid-1947, Damone had signed a contract with Mercury Records.

His first release, &quot;I Have But One Heart&quot;, reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. &quot;You Do&quot; reached the same peak. These were followed by a number of other hits. In 1948, he got his own weekly radio show, &quot;Saturday Night Serenade&quot;.

He was booked into the Mocambo nightclub on the Sunset Strip in 1949, residing briefly at the Strip&#x27;s famed Garden of Allah Hotel. In April 1949 he made his television debut on &quot;The Morey Amsterdam Show&quot; performing Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;So in Love&quot;. In January 1950 he made his first of several guest appearances on Ed Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, including a duet, the first of many, with the vocalist and future TV hostess Dinah Shore. Over the next 30 years he became a regular featured guest performer on every major variety series on network television. Among the programs on which he appeared are &quot;All Star Revue&quot;, &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot; with Milton Berle, &quot;The Arthur Murray Party&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;, &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;, &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;, &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, &quot;The Jack Paar Program&quot;, &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, &quot;Mickie Finn&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Danny Thomas Hour&quot;, &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, &quot;Della&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and several Bob Hope television specials.

Damone served as a private in Company D, 107th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard from Nov 24, 1948 to Nov 23, 1949. In 1951, Damone appeared in two movies, &quot;The Strip&quot;, where he played himself, and &quot;Rich, Young and Pretty&quot;. From 1951 to 1953, he served in the United States Army where he spent a year in Germany with the 7729th Special Services Group and eight months at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Before going into the service he recorded a number of songs that were released during that time. He served with future Northwest Indiana radio personality Al Evans and country music star Johnny Cash. After leaving the service, he married the Italian actress Pier Angeli (Anna Maria Pierangeli) in 1954 and made two movies, &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; and &quot;Athena&quot;. In 1955 he played the Caliph in &quot;Kismet&quot;. In 1960, he played an effective dramatic role in the war film &quot;Hell to Eternity&quot;.

In 1955, Damone had one song on the charts, &quot;Por Favor&quot;, which did not make it above number 73. However, he did have major roles in two movie musicals, &quot;Hit the Deck&quot; and &quot;Kismet&quot;. In early 1956, he moved from Mercury to Columbia Records, and had some success on that label with hits such as &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; (from &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, his final pop top 10) and &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; (from the movie of the same name). His six original albums on Columbia between 1957 and 1961 were That Towering Feeling!, &quot;Angela Mia&quot;, Closer Than a Kiss, &quot;This Game of Love&quot;, &quot;On the Swingin&#x27; Side&quot;, and Young and Lively.

In 1961, he was released by Columbia. Moving over to Capitol Records, he filled the gap left by Frank Sinatra&#x27;s leaving to help found Reprise Records. He lasted at Capitol only until 1965; however, he recorded some of his most highly regarded albums there, including two which made the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, &quot;Linger Awhile with Vic Damone&quot; and The Lively Ones, the latter with arrangements by Billy May, who also arranged another of Damone&#x27;s Capitol albums, &quot;Strange Enchantment&quot;. Other original Capitol albums included &quot;My Baby Loves to Swing&quot;, The Liveliest, and &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot;.

Damone did limited acting on television in the early 1960s. He played Stan Skylar in the 1960 episode &quot;Piano Man&quot; of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;. He was cast as Jess Wilkerson in the 1961 episode &quot;The Proxy&quot; of the ABC Western series &quot;The Rebel&quot;, starring Nick Adams. In 1962, he played the crooner Ric Vallone in the episode &quot;Like a Sister&quot; on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, during which he sang &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot;. In the summers of 1962 and 1963, Damone hosted a television variety series on NBC called &quot;The Lively Ones&quot;, which showcased current jazz, pop, and folk performers, as well as comedians. His group of musical guests over two seasons included Count Basie, Louie Bellson, Dave Brubeck, Chris Connor, Matt Dennis, Frances Faye, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Buddy Greco, Woody Herman, Jack Jones, Stan Kenton, Gene Krupa, Peggy Lee, Nellie Lutcher, Shelly Manne, Anita O&#x27;Day, Ruth Olay and Oscar Peterson.

Damone&#x27;s other notable television work during this time included three guest appearances from 1963 to 1964 on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;. He also guested on UK television, among other programs on &quot;The Tommy Cooper Hour&quot; Christmas special in 1974. In addition to his solo performances, Garland and he sang duet medleys of songs from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;Kismet&quot;.

In 1964, he sang &quot;Back Home Again in Indiana&quot; before the Indianapolis 500 car race.

In 1965, Damone next moved to Warner Bros. Records with the albums You Were Only Fooling and Country Love Songs. On Warner Bros., he had one top 100 chart hit: &quot;You Were Only Fooling (While I Was Falling In Love)&quot;. The next year, he switched record labels again, moving to RCA Victor and releasing the albums &quot;Stay with Me&quot;, &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Walk Away&quot;, On the South Side of Chicago, and &quot;The Damone Type of Thing&quot;. In 1967, Damone hosted &quot;The Dean Martin Summer Show&quot;, which was rerun in 1971. In 1969, he released his last US chart record, a cover of the 1966 song &quot;To Make A Big Man Cry&quot;, which made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Easy Listening chart.

Also in 1965, he appeared on the Firestone album series, &quot;Your Favorite Christmas Music, Volume 4&quot;, singing &quot;It Came Upon A Midnight Clear&quot; and &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot;.

===Later career===
In 1971, Damone began performing in Las Vegas casinos and although he had to declare bankruptcy in the early 1970s, he was earning enough to ease his financial difficulties. He made concert tours of both the US and the UK and recorded more albums for RCA Records. In the UK, he appeared on Tommy Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Special&quot; television show in 1974.

In 1972, Damone was offered the role of Johnny Fontane in &quot;The Godfather&quot; after singer Al Martino, who had previously been given the role by producer Albert S. Ruddy, had the part stripped when Francis Ford Coppola became director and wanted Damone to portray Fontane. According to Martino, after being stripped of the role, he went to Russell Bufalino, his godfather and a crime boss, who then orchestrated the publication of various news articles that claimed Coppola was unaware of Martino being awarded the part by Ruddy. Damone eventually declined the role because of a salary dispute and also because he did not want to provoke the mob or anger Frank Sinatra, whom Damone profoundly respected. Ultimately, the part of Johnny Fontane was given to Martino.

In January 1991, Damone appeared in a television commercial for Diet Pepsi first broadcast during Super Bowl XXV. Damone and other stars, including Jerry Lewis, Tiny Tim, Charo and Bo Jackson, attempt to sing Diet Pepsi&#x27;s theme song, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got the Right One Baby (Uh-Huh)&quot;, which was performed by Ray Charles.

Damone&#x27;s final album was issued in 2002, while some of his previous albums were being repackaged and reissued. In 2003, Vic decided to issue some previously unreleased material and formed Vintage Records with his son, Perry Damone. He originally planned to issue a 7 CD series called The Vic Damone Signature Collection, and in May 2003 released Volume 1, produced by Perry and Frank Sinclair. In May 2004, Vic released his second CD in the Signature Series, again produced by Perry and Sinclair. After this disc was issued, Damone decided to cancel the release of the rest of the collection. During his entire career, Damone recorded over 2,000 songs. He garnered new fans following the launch of the Vic Damone website www.vicdamone.com, in 2002. The website was created by Damone&#x27;s sons Perry and Sinclair and was ultimately managed by Damone&#x27;s son-in-law, William &quot;Bill&quot; Karant.

On January 19, 2002, Damone made one of his final public performances at the Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts in Palm Beach, Florida. Damone suffered a stroke later in the same year and subsequently retired. Damone did, however, step out of retirement on January 22, 2011, when he once again performed at the Kravis Performing Arts Center in Palm Beach, to a sold-out crowd. He dedicated this performance to his six grandchildren, who had never seen him perform live. Damone stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t need the money ... But, you know, my six grandkids have never seen me on stage. It will be the first time. I will introduce them. It&#x27;s going to be exciting for me. Before I die, I want them to have heard me perform at least once&quot;.

In Brett Ratner&#x27;s movie &quot;Money Talks&quot;, Chris Tucker&#x27;s character sees a commercial about Vic Damone and then pretends to be Damone&#x27;s son. At the time, Vic&#x27;s real-life son, Perry, had some laughs about that &quot;15 minutes of fame,&quot; and made mention of it on his midday radio show on Phoenix radio station KEZ.

On June 12, 2009, Vic Damone released his autobiography titled &quot;Singing Was the Easy Part&quot; from St. Martin&#x27;s Press. In the book, Damone claimed he had been held dangling out of a window of a New York hotel by a &quot;thug&quot;. Damone claimed he had been engaged to the thug&#x27;s daughter, but ended the relationship when she insulted Damone&#x27;s mother. He wrote that his life was spared when, during a Mafia meeting to determine the singer&#x27;s fate, New York mob boss Frank Costello ruled in Damone&#x27;s favor.

In 2010, Damone called Canadian crooner Michael Bublé talented but &quot;cocky&quot; and criticized him for smoking and drinking &quot;straight alcohol&quot; after a show, believing that it would damage his vocal cords. Bublé responded by saying that he knew what he was doing, but promising that from now on he would always mix his alcohol with soda or orange juice.

In 2020, two years after he died, an interview of Damone appeared in one of a series for the documentary &quot;Jay Sebring...Cutting to the Truth&quot;.

==Personal life==
Damone suffered a stroke in 2002 and another health scare in 2008. He recovered from both, and lived until 2018. Damone was married five times and divorced four:
# Pier Angeli (1954–1958), actress, singer (one son – Perry Damone, 1955–2014)
# Judith Rawlins (1963–1971) (three daughters – Victoria, Andrea and Daniella)
# Becky Ann Jones (1974–1982), entertainer
# Diahann Carroll (1987–1996), actress, singer
# Rena Rowan-Damone (1998–2016), fashion designer, businessperson, philanthropist

Damone had six grandchildren from his daughters (Tate, Paige, Sloane, Rocco, Daniella, Grant).

Damone&#x27;s first wife, Pier Angeli, was previously in a well-publicized relationship with James Dean, but was forced to leave him to marry Damone, a move that garnered great media attention. It was reported that Dean had watched the wedding from across the road on his motorcycle, even gunning the engine during the ceremony, although Dean later denied doing anything so &quot;dumb&quot;. Six years after divorcing Angeli, Damone was arrested on October 15, 1964, on Angeli&#x27;s charge that he had kidnapped their 9‐year‐old son Perry (named for Perry Como) and taken him from New York to Los Angeles. He was released three hours later after having pled not guilty to being a fugitive from a kidnapping charge. At the same time, a California judge awarded him custody of Perry. However, Angeli ultimately gained custody of Perry and left Hollywood for her native Italy, taking Perry with her. Perry however returned to California after Angeli&#x27;s death. Perry died of lymphoma aged 59, on December 9, 2014.

Damone married actress Diahann Carroll in 1987. The union, which Carroll admitted was turbulent, had a legal separation in 1991, reconciliation, and divorce in 1996.

Damone was raised Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy, claiming to have never found deep meaning in his original faith. In the late 1950s, he was introduced to the Baháʼí Faith by a drummer in his band. Damone said his rendition of &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; incorporates gestures meant to summon a sustaining vitality from ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá. He officially joined the religion in the early 1960s.

Damone met his Polish-born wife Rena Rowan (born &quot;Irena Aurelia Jung&quot; on January 4, 1928, in Lida, then part of Poland) in 1996, after she asked him to perform at an event to raise money for her Rowan House charity in Philadelphia, which provides housing for homeless single women with children. Rowan, a breast-cancer survivor, was a clothing distributor who started the Jones New York clothing store chain in the mid-1970s.

Damone lived in Palm Beach County, Florida in his later years. In January 2015, Damone and Rena sold their La Casita home for $5.75 million. Damone and Rena moved to a smaller residence, a townhouse in the Sloans Curve Drive neighborhood of Palm Beach. She suffered a stroke in 2011. In 2013, Damone was involved in a tug-of-war in a Palm Beach County court with Rowan&#x27;s two daughters, Nina and Lisa Rowan, for control over the destiny of Rowan and her fortune, which was reportedly worth more than $50 million. The court ultimately sided with Damone, ruling that Rena Rowan was capable of making her own decisions. Rowan died on November 6, 2016, at home in Palm Beach, Florida, from complications of pneumonia. She was 88.

Damone died on February 11, 2018, from complications of respiratory illness at the age of 89.

==Awards==
In 1997, Damone received his high school diploma from Lafayette High School in Brooklyn when officials with the school granted credits for life experience and asked him to give the commencement address, in which he advised students to &quot;Have spiritual guidance. Don&#x27;t lose God. There is a God. Trust me.&quot;

In 1997, Damone received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Frank Sinatra said that Damone had &quot;the best set of pipes in the business.&quot;

For his contribution to the recording industry, Damone has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1731 Vine Street in Los Angeles, California.

In 2014, Damone received the Society for the Preservation of the Great American Songbook&#x27;s first Legend Award in recognition of those who have made a significant contribution to the genre.

<text>Cubitt Town is a district on the eastern side of the Isle of Dogs in London, England. This part of the former Metropolitan Borough of Poplar was redeveloped as part of the Port of London in the 1840s and 1850s by William Cubitt, Lord Mayor of London (1860–1862), after whom it is named. It is on the east of the Isle, facing the Royal Borough of Greenwich across the River Thames. To the west is Millwall, to the east and south is Greenwich, to the northwest Canary Wharf, and to the north — across the Blue Bridge — is Blackwall. The district is situated within the Blackwall &amp; Cubitt Town Ward of Tower Hamlets London Borough Council.

==History==

It is named after William Cubitt, Lord Mayor of London (1860–1862), who was responsible for the development of the housing and amenities of the area in the 1840s and 1850s, mainly to house the growing population of workers in the local docks, shipbuilding yards and factories. As it grew, Cubitt also created many local businesses employing manual labourers as well as the streets of housing to accommodate them.

===Shipbuilding===
The area was home shipbuilders including Westwood, Baillie, Samuda Brothers, J &amp; W Dudgeon and Yarrow Shipbuilders. , the first British warship designed to carry her main armament in gun turrets, was launched here.

===Other industries===
The businesses included those involved in cement, pottery and brick production. Asphalt production was another growth industry, coinciding with the growth, development, and industrialisation of areas throughout the British Isles. In Cubitt Town, the Pyrimont Wharf was developed in 1861 by the Asphalte de Seyssel Company of Thames Embankment (later known as the Seyssel Asphalte Company or Seyssel Pyrimont Asphalte Company), with asphalt production taken over in the 1870s by Claridge&#x27;s Patent Asphalte Company.

==Housing==
Estates in the area include:
* New Union Wharf Estate - East Thames Housing
* Samuda Estate - One Housing
* St John&#x27;s Estate - One Housing
* Amsterdam Road - Private
* Millennium Wharf - Private

The area is a mix of old east London working-class communities transplanted into 1960s and 1970s high-rise estates and the middle-class workers in the Canary Wharf complex attracted by relatively low prices for riverside living, plus less recent Bangladeshi and East Asian immigrant populations.

==Learning and education==

A public library was financed by Andrew Carnegie and built by C. Harrold Norton, being completed in 1905. Will Crooks, the then Mayor of Poplar, had attended a meeting at the Guildhall, where Carnegie had promised to fund public libraries. Crooks was able to get a commitment from him to pay for two libraries, this one in Cubitt Town and another in Bromley by Bow. Carnegie agreed to provide £15,000 for both together. The total expense for this building was £6,805 13s 10d, which included some neighbouring land which originally served as a public garden before providing space for an extension to be used a meeting hall and erected in 1962.

The building is currently owned by the Tower Hamlets London Borough Council as part of their library service.

<doc id="563027" wikidata="Q1606422" url="?curid=563027" title="Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn">
<text>Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn (March 3, 1783 – July 29, 1851) was an American soldier, lawyer, author, and statesman. Dearborn was the first President of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and the author of many books.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Dearborn was the son of Secretary of War and Major General Henry Dearborn by his second wife and named for his father&#x27;s friend, Alexander Scammell.

Dearborn was married to Hannah Swett Lee, daughter of Colonel William Raymond Lee (1745–1824) of Massachusetts.

Dearborn attended the common schools; attended Williams College for two years; and graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1803.

===Early career===
Dearborn studied law, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Salem, Massachusetts, and Portland (then part of Massachusetts&#x27;s District of Maine).

In 1808 he oversaw the construction of Fort Preble and Fort Scammel in the harbor defenses of Portland. During the War of 1812 he commanded volunteers manning the defenses of Boston harbor. He replaced his father as the Collector of the Port of Boston and served from 1813 to 1829. He was promoted to brigadier general in the Massachusetts Militia in 1814.

After the war, he was elected captain of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts in 1816. Dearborn was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1823.

===Political career===
Dearborn was a delegate to the Massachusetts state constitutional convention in 1820. He was a member of the Massachusetts state house of representatives in 1829 and a member of the Massachusetts Senate in 1830. He was elected as an Anti-Jacksonian Representative from Massachusetts 10th District to the Twenty-second Congress (1831–1833). He was defeated running for reelection in 1832.

He served as adjutant general of the Massachusetts Militia with the rank of major general from 1834 to 1843.

He was elected Mayor of Roxbury, Massachusetts, in 1846 and served from 1847 to 1851. 
In 1848, while he was Mayor of Roxbury, Dearborn designed and founded the Forest Hills Cemetery. He also designed Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the first rural cemetery in the nation.

==Society of the Cincinnati==

In 1832, following the decease of his father, he was admitted to the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. In 1848, following the death of President General William Popham in September 1847, he was elected as President General of the Society. He was the first President General to be a hereditary member rather than a veteran of the Revolution.
As President General he proposed changes in the Society&#x27;s membership rules to allow for descendants of other than original members to join. This provision is known as the Rule of 1854.

He died in office in 1851, having served a single three-year term.

===Attempted Vice Presidential Nomination===
The Native American Party, a precursor to the Know Nothings, which had split from the Whig Party in 1845, met in September 1847 in Philadelphia, where they nominated Zachary Taylor for president while Dearborn was selected as his running mate. However, when the Whig Party nominated Taylor for the presidency with Millard Fillmore as his running mate the following year, this rendered his previous nomination moot and the Native American Party failed to make an alternate nomination.

===Death and interment===
Dearborn died on July 29, 1851, at the age of 68 in Portland, Maine, and is interred in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
The &quot;dearborn&quot;, a light four-wheeled carriage with curtained sides, was named after him (he maintained such a carriage).

Dearborn&#x27;s nephew was William R. Lee (1807–1891), who was colonel of the 20th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment during the Civil War and was breveted to brigadier general after the war.

Three successive grade schools in Roxbury have been named after General Dearborn: The first was built in 1852; the second, still standing at 25 Ambrose Street, was built in 1905; and after that closed, the old Roxbury High School was renamed the Dearborn Middle School in 1981. A fourth school, the Dearborn STEM School, is now in the planning stages.

<text>William Sheridan Allen (October 5, 1932 – March 14, 2013) was an American historian.

==Biography==
Allen was born in Evanston, Illinois, and studied at the universities of Michigan, Connecticut, and Minnesota, and in Germany at the Free University of Berlin and the University of Göttingen. &quot;The Nazi Seizure of Power&quot; (1965) was his first book. He also wrote &quot;The Infancy of Nazism&quot; and worked on studies of the effectiveness of Nazi propaganda and of the Social Democratic underground in the Third Reich. He retired in 2001 as professor of history at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 

Allen wrote two books on Adolf Hitler debunking the assertion that he came to power through violence. Rather, Allen claims, Hitler&#x27;s Nazi movement &quot;seized power&quot; in an act akin to democratic tactics.

His most famous book, &quot;The Nazi Seizure of Power: The Experience of a Single German Town 1930–1935&quot;, was written to explain how one city (Northeim, Germany) fell into the Nazi trap. Fed by Nazi propaganda, many people of Northeim, especially in the middle classes, in the midst of the Great Depression saw the Nazis as a way to get their country back to greatness that Hitler and the Nazis promised they would do. The book was widely reviewed and extremely influential.

<doc id="563030" wikidata="Q449612" url="?curid=563030" title="Johnny Mathis">
<text>John Royce Mathis (born September 30, 1935) is an American singer and is one of the best-selling recording artists of the 20th century. Starting his career with singles of standard music, Mathis became highly popular as an album artist, with several of his albums achieving gold or platinum status and 73 making the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. 

Mathis has received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for three recordings. Although frequently described as a romantic singer, his discography includes traditional pop, Latin American, soul, rhythm and blues, show tunes, Tin Pan Alley, soft rock, blues, country music, and even a few disco songs for his album &quot;Mathis Magic&quot; in 1979. Mathis has also recorded seven albums of Christmas music. In a 1968 interview, he cited Lena Horne, Nat King Cole, and Bing Crosby among his musical influences.

==Early life and education==
Mathis was born in Gilmer, Texas, on September 30, 1935, the fourth of seven children of Clem Mathis and Mildred Boyd, both domestic cooks. Mathis is African-American and has stated that he has Native American ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side. The family moved to San Francisco when Mathis was five, settling on 32nd Avenue in the Richmond District, where Mathis grew up.

Mathis&#x27; father worked in vaudeville as a singer and pianist, and on realizing his son&#x27;s talent, bought an old upright piano for $25 (US$ in dollars), and encouraged his music. Mathis began learning songs and routines from his father; his parents also ran his fan club. Mathis&#x27; first song was &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;, and he started singing and dancing for visitors at home, at school, and at church functions.

When Mathis was 13, voice teacher Connie Cox accepted him as her student in exchange for housework. Mathis studied with Cox for six years, learning vocal scales and exercises, voice production, classical and operatic singing. The first band Mathis sang with was formed by his high school friend, Merl Saunders. Mathis eulogized Saunders at his funeral in 2008, thanking him for that first chance at being a singer.

Mathis was a star athlete at George Washington High School in San Francisco. He was a high jumper, hurdler, and basketball player. In 1954, Mathis enrolled at San Francisco State College on an athletic scholarship, competing in both basketball and track, and intending to become a physical education teacher. While there, he set a high jump record of , still one of the college&#x27;s top jump heights and only short of the 1952 Olympic record of . Mathis and future NBA star Bill Russell were featured in a 1954 sports section article of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; demonstrating their high-jumping skills, as at the time Russell was No. 1 and Mathis was No. 2 in the City of San Francisco.

==Career==
===Early years===
While singing at a Sunday afternoon jam session with a friend&#x27;s jazz sextet at the Black Hawk Club in San Francisco, Mathis attracted the attention of the club&#x27;s co-founder, Helen Noga. She became his music manager and found Mathis a job singing weekends at Ann Dee&#x27;s 440 Club. In September 1955, she learned that George Avakian, head of Popular Music A&amp;R at Columbia Records, was on vacation near San Francisco. After repeated calls, Noga finally persuaded Avakian to come hear Mathis at the 440 Club. After hearing Mathis sing, Avakian sent his record company a telegram stating: &quot;Have found phenomenal 19-year-old boy who could go all the way. Send blank contracts.&quot;

At San Francisco State, Mathis had become noteworthy as a high jumper, and in 1956, he was asked to try out for the U.S. Olympic Team that would travel to Melbourne that November. On his father&#x27;s advice, Mathis opted to embark on a professional singing career.

Mathis&#x27; first record album, &quot;Johnny Mathis: A New Sound In Popular Song&quot;, was a slow-selling jazz album, but Mathis stayed in New York City to sing in nightclubs. His second album was produced by Columbia Records vice-president and record producer Mitch Miller, who helped to define the Mathis sound. Miller preferred that Mathis sing soft, romantic ballads, pairing him with conductor and music arranger Ray Conniff, and later, Ray Ellis, Glenn Osser, and Robert Mersey. In late 1956, Mathis recorded two of his most popular songs: &quot;Wonderful! Wonderful!&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Not for Me to Say.&quot; Also that year, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed him up to sing the latter song in the movie &quot;Lizzie&quot; (1957).

===Showbiz millionaire===
In June 1957, Mathis appeared on the popular TV program &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which helped increase his popularity. Later that year, Mathis released his second single to sell one million copies, &quot;Chances Are.&quot; In November 1957, Mathis released &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;, which featured in the film of the same title and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. He performed the song at the ceremony in March 1958.
The week before his appearance at the Academy Awards, &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; was released. The album spent an unprecedented 490 consecutive weeks (nearly nine-and-a-half years) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 200 album charts, including three weeks at number one. It held the record for the most weeks on the top &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums in the US for 15 years, until Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (March 1973) reached 491 weeks in October 1983.

Later in 1958, Mathis made his second film appearance for 20th Century Fox, singing the song &quot;A Certain Smile&quot; in the film of that title. The song was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By the end of the year, he was set to earn $1 million a year. Critics called him &quot;the velvet voice.&quot; In 1962, &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine listed Mathis as one of 30-35 millionaires on their list of &quot;America&#x27;s 100 Richest Negroes.&quot; Mathis had two of his biggest hits in 1962 and 1963, with &quot;Gina&quot; (number 6) and &quot;What Will Mary Say&quot; (number 9).

===Split from Noga===
In October 1964, Mathis sued Noga to void their management arrangement, which Noga fought with a counterclaim in December 1964. After splitting from Noga, Mathis established Jon Mat Records, incorporated in California on May 11, 1967, to produce his recordings, and Rojon Productions, incorporated in California on his 29th birthday, September 30, 1964, to handle all of his concert, theater, showroom, and television appearances, and all promotional and charitable activities. (Previously, Mathis had founded Global Records to produce his Mercury albums.) Mathis&#x27; new manager and business partner was Ray Haughn, who, until his death in September 1984, helped guide Mathis&#x27; career.

===Popularity plateau===
While Mathis continued to make music, the ascent of the Beatles and early 1970s album rock kept his adult contemporary recordings out of the pop singles charts, until he experienced a career renaissance in the late 1970s. Mathis had the 1976 Christmas number one single in the UK with the song &quot;When a Child Is Born&quot; and later, in 1978, recorded &quot;Too Much, Too Little, Too Late&quot; with singer Deniece Williams. The lyrics and music were arranged by Nat Kipner and John McIntyre Vallins. Released as a single in 1978, it reached number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart, number nine on the Canadian Singles Chart and number three on the UK Singles Chart. It also topped the US R&amp;B and adult contemporary charts. &quot;Too Much, Too Little, Too Late&quot; was certified gold and silver in the US and in the UK by the RIAA and the British Phonographic Industry, respectively. It was his first number one hit since his 1957 chart-topper &quot;Chances Are.&quot;

The duo released a follow-up duet, their version of &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;, peaking at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 1983, they were credited with performing &quot;Without Us&quot;, the theme song for the American television sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot;, from its second season onwards. The success of the duets with Williams prompted Mathis to record duets with a variety of partners, including Dionne Warwick, Natalie Cole, Gladys Knight, Jane Olivor, Stephanie Lawrence, and Nana Mouskouri. A compilation album, also called &quot;Too Much, Too Little, Too Late&quot;, released by Sony Music in 1995, featured the title track among other songs by Mathis and Williams.

===Recent years===
From 1980 to 1981, Mathis recorded an album with Chic&#x27;s Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers, &quot;I Love My Lady&quot;, which remained unreleased in its entirety until its 2017 appearance in the 68-disc collection The Voice of Romance: The Columbia Original Album Collection. Three tracks had appeared on a Chic box set in 2010 and a fourth, the title track, on Mathis&#x27; &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; in 2011 and the Chic Organization&#x27;s &quot;Up All Night&quot; in 2013.

Mathis returned to the British Top 30 album chart in 2007 with the Sony BMG release &quot;The Very Best of Johnny Mathis&quot;; in 2008 with the CD &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;; and again in 2011 with &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;

Mathis continues to perform live, but from 2000 forward, he limited his concert performances to about 50 to 60 per year. Mathis is one of the last pop singers who travels with his own full orchestra (as opposed to a band).

On January 14, 2016, Mathis performed to a sold-out audience in The Villages as part of his &quot;60th Anniversary Concert Tour.&quot;

===Career achievements===
Mathis, Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett, Billy Joel, and Bruce Springsteen carry the distinction of having the longest tenure of any recording artists on the Columbia label. With the exception of a four-year break to record for Mercury Records in the mid-1960s, Mathis has been with Columbia Records throughout his career, from 1956 to 1963 and from 1968 to the present. (Dylan spent a couple of years at Asylum Records then re-signed with Columbia; Bennett recorded for Verve and his own Improv label from 1972 to 1986 when he returned to Columbia; Joel has been with the label since his 1973 album &quot;Piano Man;&quot; Streisand and Springsteen have never left.)

Mathis has had five of his albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts simultaneously, an achievement equaled by only three other singers: Frank Sinatra, Barry Manilow, and (posthumously) Prince. Mathis has released 200 singles and had 71 songs charted worldwide.

==Other appearances==
Mathis has taped 12 of his own television specials and made over 300 television guest appearances, with 54 (Rojon Productions Archives) of them being on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Longtime &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Johnny Carson said, &quot;Johnny Mathis is the best ballad singer in the world.&quot; Mathis appeared on the show with Carson&#x27;s successor, Jay Leno, on March 29, 2007, to sing &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot; with the saxophonist Dave Koz. Through the years, Mathis&#x27; songs (or parts of them) have been heard in more than 100 television shows and films around the globe. His appearance on the &quot;Live by Request&quot; broadcast in May 1998 on the A&amp;E Network had the largest television viewing audience of the series. In 1989, Mathis sang the theme for the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;Loving&quot;.

Mathis served as narrator for &quot;&#x27;51 Dons&quot;, a 2014 documentary film about the integrated and undefeated 1951 San Francisco Dons football team. The team was denied a chance to play in a bowl game because it refused to agree to not play its two African-American players, Ollie Matson and Burl Toler, who were childhood friends of Mathis.

Mathis appeared in the Season 14 finale of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;Truth or Dare&quot;, in which he played himself as an old friend of David Rossi and served as best man at Rossi&#x27;s wedding.

Matthis also played himself in the 2017 movie Just Getting Started.

==Personal life==
Despite missing the Olympic high-jump trials, Mathis retains his enthusiasm for sports. Mathis is an avid golfer, with nine holes-in-one to his credit. Mathis has also hosted several Johnny Mathis Golf Tournaments in the United Kingdom and the U.S. Since 1985, he has been hosting a charity golf tournament in Belfast sponsored by Shell, and the annual Johnny Mathis Invitational Track &amp; Field Meet has continued at San Francisco State University since it started in 1982. Mathis also enjoys cooking, and published a cookbook called &quot;Cooking for You Alone&quot; in 1982.

Mathis has undergone rehabilitation for alcoholism and prescription drug addiction and he has supported many organizations through the years, including the American Cancer Society, the March of Dimes, the YWCA and YMCA, the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the NAACP.

Mathis is a convert to Catholicism.

Mathis was quoted in a 1982 &quot;Us&quot; magazine article, stating: &quot;Homosexuality is a way of life that I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to.&quot; Mathis later said the comment was supposed to have been off the record and did not publicly discuss his sexual orientation for many years after. In 2006, Mathis said that his silence had been due to death threats he received as a result of that 1982 article. On April 13, 2006, Mathis had a podcast interview with &quot;The Strip&quot; in which he tackled the subject once again, and how his reluctance to speak on the subject was partly a generational issue. In an interview with &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; aired May 14, 2017, Mathis discussed the &quot;Us&quot; magazine article and confirmed that he is gay by saying, &quot;I come from San Francisco. It&#x27;s not unusual to be gay in San Francisco. I&#x27;ve had some girlfriends, some boyfriends, just like most people. But I never got married, for instance. I knew that I was gay.&quot; Mathis spoke to many news sources, including CBS, about his sexuality and his coming out story.

In November 2015, Mathis returned home from a concert in Ohio to find his Hollywood house destroyed by a fire. He had owned it for 56 years. On January 17, 2023, a series of powerful storms drenched the hillside in front of his rebuilt home in Hollywood Hills, causing a collapse of the hillside, and crushing a silver Jaguar with debris and mud. The hillside landslide cut off utilities, exposing water pipes and infrastructure to the elements. The ground had given way in the 1400 block of Sunset Plaza Drive during the storm, taking out landscaping and terrain next to the home. It remained unclear at the time of news reports exactly when Mathis, aged 87 and still performing concerts, would be able to return and reoccupy his home, as its structural stability was uncertain given surrounding terrain damage.

While the character Shy Baldwin from &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; is a composite character based on several different singers, Rachel Brosnahan said she most strongly associated Mathis with the character.

==Honors and awards==
===Grammys===
In 2003, the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded Mathis the Lifetime Achievement Award. This Special Merit Award is presented by vote of the Recording Academy&#x27;s National Trustees to performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artist significance to the field of recording.

===Grammy Hall of Fame===
Mathis has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for three separate recordings – in 1998 for &quot;Chances Are&quot;, in 2002 for &quot;Misty&quot;, and in 2008 for &quot;It&#x27;s Not for Me to Say.&quot;

===Great American Songbook Hall of Fame===
On June 21, 2014, Mathis was inducted into the Great American Songbook Hall of Fame along with Linda Ronstadt, Shirley Jones, and Nat King Cole (whose daughter Natalie Cole accepted the award on his behalf). The awards were presented by the Center for the Performing Arts artistic director Michael Feinstein. Defined on their website, &quot;Conceived as an enduring testament to the Great American Songbook, the Hall of Fame honors performers and composers responsible for creating America&#x27;s soundtrack.&quot;

===Other===
On June 1, 1972, Mathis was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to music. Six years later, Mathis&#x27; hit duet &quot;The Last Time I Felt Like This&quot; from the film &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Mathis and Jane Olivor sang the song at the Academy Awards ceremony, in his second performance at the Oscars. Mathis&#x27; first occurred 20 years earlier in 1958, when he sang &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot; by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington from the movie of the same name. Mathis was also awarded the Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006. In 2007, he was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. In 1988, Mathis appeared as a guest vocalist, accompanied by Henry Mancini, on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; to sing Henry&#x27;s theme to the &quot;Viewer Mail&quot; segment. In 2011, Mathis received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member General Colin Powell.

In 2017, San Francisco State University awarded Mathis an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree. He had attended San Francisco State for three semesters before withdrawing in 1956 to pursue his music career.

<text>The Greenwich Peninsula is an area of Greenwich in South East London, England. It is bounded on three sides by a loop of the Thames, between the Isle of Dogs to the west and Silvertown to the east. To the south is the rest of Greenwich, to the south-east is Charlton.

Formerly known as Greenwich Marshes and as Bugsby&#x27;s Marshes, it became known as East Greenwich as it developed in the 19th century, but more recently has been called North Greenwich due to the location of the North Greenwich Underground station (not to be confused with North Greenwich on the Isle of Dogs, at the north side of a former ferry from Greenwich). The peninsula&#x27;s northernmost point on the riverside is known as &quot;Blackwall Point&quot;, and this may have led to the name &quot;Blackwall Peninsula&quot; sometimes being used in the late 20th century.

Landmarks include &quot;The Dome&quot; (also known by the current corporate logo The O2 and previously the Millennium Dome), the southern end of the Blackwall Tunnel and the western end of the Silvertown Tunnel, but the area is now being substantially redeveloped with new homes, offices, schools and parks. Ravensbourne University London, a media and design university built on the peninsula in 2010, neighbours The O2.

==History==

The peninsula was drained by Dutch engineers in the 16th century, allowing it to be used as pasture land. In the 17th century, Blackwall Point (the northern tip of the peninsula, opposite Blackwall) gained notoriety as a location where pirates&#x27; corpses were hung in cages as a deterrent to other would-be pirates. In the 1690s the Board of Ordnance established a gunpowder magazine on the west side of the peninsula, which was in operation by 1695, serving as the government&#x27;s primary magazine (where newly milled powder was stored before it was sent out, on board specially equipped hoys). Alongside the magazine were a wharf, a proof house and accommodation for the resident Storekeeper. From the early 18th century, however, local residents began petitioning Parliament for the magazine (and its dangerous contents in particular) to be removed; this eventually led to the establishment of a new set of Royal Gunpowder Magazines down river at Purfleet, which was opened in 1765. By 1771 gunpowder was no longer stored at Greenwich, though the buildings remained &quot;in situ&quot; for some decades afterwards.

The peninsula was steadily industrialised from the early 19th century onwards. In 1857 a plan was presented to Parliament for a huge dock occupying much of the peninsula, connected to Greenwich Reach to the west and Bugsby&#x27;s Reach to the east, but this came to nothing. Early industries included Henry Blakeley&#x27;s Ordnance Works making heavy guns, with other sites making chemicals, submarine cables, iron boats, iron and steel. Henry Bessemer built a steel works in the early 1860s to supply the London shipbuilding industry, but this closed as a result of a fall in demand due to the financial crisis of 1866. Later came oil mills, shipbuilding (for example the 1870 clippers &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en&quot; built by Maudslay), boiler making, manufacture of Portland cement and linoleum (Bessemer&#x27;s works became the Victoria linoleum works) and the South Metropolitan Gas company&#x27;s huge East Greenwich Gas Works. Early in the 20th century came bronze manufacturers Delta Metals and works making asbestos and &#x27;Molassine Meal&#x27; animal feed.
For over 100 years the peninsula was dominated by the gasworks which primarily produced town gas, also known as coal gas. The gasworks grew to , the largest in Europe, also producing coke, tar and chemicals as important secondary products. The site had its own extensive railway system and a large jetty used to unload coal and load coke. There were two huge gas holders, of 8.6 and 12.2 million ft3 (240,000 m3 and 345,000 m3). The larger holder, originally the largest in the world, was reduced to 8.9 million ft3 (250,000 m3) when it was damaged in the Silvertown explosion in 1917, but was still the largest in England until it was damaged again by a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb in 1978. Originally manufacturing gas from coal, the plant began to manufacture gas from oil in the 1960s. Its peak production of 400 million ft3 per day (11.3 million m3) in the mid 1960s is believed to have been the largest of any single site in the world. The discovery of natural gas reserves in the North Sea soon rendered the complex obsolete.
On the eastern shore was Blackwall Point Power Station; the original station from the 1890s was replaced in the 1950s by a new station which ceased operation in about 1981. On the western shore, a large area including the site of the Victoria linoleum works later became the Victoria Deep Water Terminal in 1966, handling container traffic.
At the southwestern end of the peninsula Enderby&#x27;s Wharf was occupied by a succession of famous submarine cable companies from 1857 onwards, including Glass Elliot, W T Henley, Telcon, Submarine Cables Ltd, STC, Nortel and Alcatel.

The peninsula remained relatively remote from central London until the opening of the Blackwall Tunnel in 1897, and had no passenger railway or London Underground service until the opening of North Greenwich tube station on the Jubilee line in 1999.

Closure of the gasworks, power station and other industries in the late 20th century left much of the Greenwich Peninsula a barren wasteland, much of it heavily contaminated.

In the early years of the 21st century, surviving industries were mainly concentrated on the western side of the peninsula, between the river and the A102 Blackwall Tunnel southern approach road. They included Alcatel, a Tunnel Refiners/Amylum glucose plant (from 1976 until about 2008 part of Tate &amp; Lyle) which closed in 2009, and two large marine aggregate terminals on the Delta Metals and Victoria Deep Water Terminal sites. The second of the two gas holders was demolished in 2020.

===Redevelopment since the 1990s===

Public and private investment since the early 1990s has brought about some dramatic changes in the peninsula&#x27;s topography. In 1997 the national regeneration agency English Partnerships (later renamed the Homes and Communities Agency, now Homes England) purchased 1.21 square kilometres (300 acres) of disused land on the peninsula. The agency&#x27;s investment of over £225m has helped to enhance the transport network and create new homes, commercial space and community facilities and to open up access to parkland along the river.
In addition to the construction of the Millennium Dome, new roads were built on the eastern side of the peninsula in anticipation of new developments. New riverside walkways, cycle paths and public artworks were also created, including Antony Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Quantum Cloud&quot; and Richard Wilson&#x27;s &quot;A Slice of Reality&quot;. (In 2015, these were among five North Greenwich artworks incorporated into &quot;The Line&quot;, a public sculpture trail spanning the River Thames.)

Two phases of Greenwich Millennium Village, a mixed-tenure residential development designed by architect Ralph Erskine, with a primary school, a medical centre, a nature reserve with associated education centre have been completed. A Holiday Inn hotel was also built nearby, and the Greenwich Yacht Club was relocated to a new site south-east of the Dome.

North Greenwich tube station on the Jubilee line opened in 1999. It is one of the largest London Underground stations and also has a bus station. The North Greenwich Pier offering commuter boat services to other parts of London, both east and west, is located on the Thames on the east side of the peninsula.

In 2004 outline planning permission was granted for further large-scale redevelopment of the site, including over 10,000 further homes, some facing the river or overlooking the park, of office space and the conversion of the Millennium Dome into an indoor arena, renamed The O2, which was used as a London 2012 venue. South of The O2, new public realms were created, &quot;Peninsula Square&quot; and &quot;Green Place&quot;. To the east of Peninsula Square is Ravensbourne University London, which relocated to Greenwich Peninsula in September 2010. In 2011, the university&#x27;s campus won an award in the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Awards for London. From a shortlist of 55 schemes, the Ravensbourne building won the education and community category.

To the south east of the square, the six storey 14 Pier Walk building houses offices for Transport for London. Adjacent to this is the 11 storey 6 Mitre Passage office building. New restaurants and shops have opened facing onto Peninsula Square and Green Place.

Transport for London constructed a cable car over the River Thames just before the 2012 Summer Olympics began. This runs from a riverside station south-east of the O2 over the river to the Royal Victoria Dock west of the ExCeL Centre.

Adjacent to the cable car terminus was a large temporary building housing the London Soccer Dome, formerly the David Beckham Academy. This opened in 2005 but closed in 2014, with the main structures being dismantled, transported and re-erected in Southend; the site is intended for residential use. Approximately 400 m further south, at the western end of River Way, is the Pilot Inn public house, which, along with the adjacent housing terrace, is among the oldest remaining buildings on the peninsula.
Central Park runs through the central spine of the peninsula, with the Greenwich Peninsula Ecology Park further south providing a haven for many different species of bird, plants and insects.

A combined heat and power (CHP) energy centre has been constructed adjacent to and east of the A102 Blackwall Tunnel Southern Approach to provide district heating to an eventual total of 15,700 properties on the peninsula. It is operated by Pinnacle Power for Greenwich Peninsula ESCO Limited. A 49 m high tower forms part of the energy centre, designed by C. F. Møller Architects, and was completed in 2016. The tower is clad in a complex metal cladding formed of hundreds of triangular patterns (initially titled &#x27;Lenticular Dazzle Camouflage&#x27;), designed by British artist Conrad Shawcross. The tower cladding later featured as part of an art trail around north Greenwich, with the work given the title &#x27;The Optic Cloak&#x27;.

In 2016, construction started on new buildings for St Mary Magdalene Church of England School (part of the Koinonia Federation; the federation then operated at four Greenwich sites, two of which moved to the new building on completion in September 2018). The school is located at the corner of Millennium Way and John Harrison Way, and has sports facilities available for community use.

==Future development==
The peninsula is now being developed with new homes at Peninsula Riverside, and Parkside Peninsula Quays. The redevelopment of Greenwich Peninsula is planned to take around 20 years. The improved access to the peninsula from Canary Wharf, the City and the West End via the Jubilee line has increased the prospects for continued residential regeneration.

<doc id="563040" wikidata="Q53095" url="?curid=563040" title="Hopscotch (film)">
<text>Hopscotch is a 1980 American comedy spy film produced by Edie Landau and Ely A. Landau, directed by Ronald Neame, and stars Walter Matthau, Glenda Jackson, Sam Waterston, Ned Beatty and Herbert Lom. The screenplay is written by Bryan Forbes and Brian Garfield, based on Garfield&#x27;s 1975 novel.

Garfield took the name of his book from the children&#x27;s playground game, &quot;wherein a player has to retrieve &#x27;an elusive object&#x27; while hopping on a sidewalk from space to space. One false step or clumsy move could mean falling and landing on one&#x27;s backside.&quot;

Matthau&#x27;s performance received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 38th Golden Globe Awards. In 2002, the Criterion Collection released the film on DVD, followed by a 2K restoration on Blu-ray in 2017.

==Plot==
At Munich&#x27;s Oktoberfest, veteran CIA field agent Miles Kendig and his team foil a microfilm transfer. When Kendig returns to Washington, his boss, Myerson, reassigns him to a desk job because Kendig did not arrest Yaskov, the head of the KGB in Europe. Kendig explains to Myerson that he knows how Yaskov thinks, and it would take time and resources to identify and learn about a new replacement. Kendig&#x27;s good friend and protégé Joe Cutter is nevertheless assigned to take over his mentor&#x27;s old job.

Instead of accepting this situation, Kendig takes action. He shreds his personnel file and flies to Salzburg to visit his former lover Isobel von Schönenberg, whom he has not seen in a while. Yaskov, guessing what has happened, meets Kendig and invites him to defect to the KGB; when Kendig refuses, Yaskov sarcastically asks if Kendig will be retiring and writing his memoirs.

On the spot, Kendig decides to do exactly that; write and publish a memoir exposing the dirty tricks and general incompetence of Myerson&#x27;s CIA. Isobel is horrified, saying that Myerson will send agents to kill him. She nevertheless helps by mailing copies of Kendig&#x27;s first chapter to spy chiefs in the U.S., Soviet Union, China, France, Italy and Great Britain. Myerson assigns Cutter to stop Kendig. Yaskov, not wanting his own agency&#x27;s follies exposed, also pursues his old adversary.

Kendig baits his pursuers by sending them explosive chapters and by periodically informing them of his location. Leaving Europe, he returns to the U.S., cheerfully renting Myerson&#x27;s unoccupied Georgia family home, where he writes more chapters. After purposely leaking his address, Kendig convinces the FBI (which has jurisdiction) to barrage Myerson&#x27;s home with both bullets and tear gas, to Myerson&#x27;s great dismay.

Kendig flies to Bermuda by chartered seaplane, then to London to present his publisher with the final chapter. Yaskov informs Cutter that one of his agents has spotted Kendig in London by chance. Kendig purchases a vintage biplane—a Stampe version of the Tiger Moth—and hires an engineer to custom-modify it for a specific task. Myerson meets Kendig&#x27;s publisher, who rebuffs his threatening bluster and then tells them where Kendig&#x27;s hotel room is. At the vacated room, all the pursuers read copies of the final chapter he has left for them.

Kendig ambushes Cutter in his hotel room, ties him up, gags him, and informs Cutter that he will be flying across the English Channel from a small airfield near Beachy Head. Meanwhile, Isobel gives her CIA minders the slip, and crosses the Channel by hovercraft to rendezvous early the next morning with Kendig. While everyone converges on the airfield, Kendig suffers a flat tire on his way and is taken by the local police to their station. When a policeman recognizes him from a posted fugitive bulletin, Kendig escapes by short-circuiting an electrical socket and stealing a police car.

Kendig reaches the airfield, and the Americans and Yaskov arrive by helicopter soon afterward. Kendig&#x27;s biplane takes off and is pursued by Myerson in the helicopter. Kendig&#x27;s biplane evades Myerson&#x27;s gunfire for a while, but the plane finally appears to be hit and suddenly explodes over the Channel. In fact, it was deliberately destroyed by Kendig, who has been operating it from the ground by remote control. Myerson and his CIA team assume that Kendig is finally dead; however, Cutter wryly remarks that he &quot;better stay dead&quot;. Meanwhile, Kendig sneaks away from a deteriorating building on the edge of the airfield, using a barrel of spent oil to dispose of the remote control that he used to fly and destroy the biplane. He and Isobel set out for a few weeks&#x27; stay in the south of France.

Months later, Kendig&#x27;s explosive memoir entitled &quot;Hopscotch&quot; has become an international bestseller. Disguised as a Sikh, Kendig begins to chat in a British accent with a local bookstore clerk. He purchases a copy of his own book, much to Isobel&#x27;s complete exasperation with his antics and &quot;ridiculous disguises&quot;.

===Film score===
The film features many pieces by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Notable examples include the aria &quot;Non più andrai&quot; from the opera &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, the andante movement from Eine kleine Nachtmusik, the first movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata No.11, K331 (best known for the third movement, the Rondo alla turca), the Posthorn Serenade, K320 and a Rondo for piano and orchestra in D, K382.

In the &quot;Hopscotch - Criterion Collection&quot; DVD special feature &quot;Introduction by Neame &amp; Garfield&quot;, director Neame stated that Matthau&#x27;s agent made the suggestion that they put in some Mozart because this would greatly please Matthau. As they looked into this, they realized that it would enhance the movie if Kendig loved Mozart. Ian Fraser was the arranger and found many sections of Mozart that fit the movie, but they could not find anything to go with Kendig typing. They asked Matthau; he brought in some Mozart that went perfectly with it.

Hermann Prey&#x27;s singing of &quot;Non più andrai&quot; highlights the antics of the old biplane as Myerson is shooting at it. The song tells how the young Cherubino, going into the army, will no longer be a dainty favorite, just as 5-foot-7 Myerson is going to lose his power at the CIA. Also, the song describes bullets flying and even bombs exploding.

The aria &quot;Largo al Factotum&quot; from the opera &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; by Gioachino Rossini is also featured. Matthau sings this as he passes a border checkpoint. The words to the aria explain how everyone is looking for the barber, and he moves fast like lightning.

Kendig has the aria &quot;Un bel dì, vedremo&quot; (&quot;One fine day we&#x27;ll see&quot;) from &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; by Giacomo Puccini playing loudly on the stereo as the FBI and CIA shoot up Myerson&#x27;s wife&#x27;s house. The operatic contrapunto adds a surreal air of ironic justice to the events as Madame Butterfly sings how she will hide from her husband.

The credits also list &quot;Once a Night&quot; written by Jackie English and Beverly Bremers. This is the song blaring playing at the bar &quot;The Other End&quot;, when Matthau arranges his flight from Georgia. &quot;Once a Night&quot; peaked at number 94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 43 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

===Casting===
According to Neame in the DVD special feature &quot;Introduction by Neame &amp; Garfield&quot;, the Jewish Matthau refused to film on location in Germany, as he had lost many relatives in the Holocaust. However, he wanted to have Neame cast his son David and later his stepdaughter Lucy Saroyan, so Matthau gave in. David Matthau played Ross, the CIA agent Kendig, who take prisoner after leaving Myerson&#x27;s house, and Saroyan the pilot who takes Kendig to Bermuda.

According to Neame, he did not think that they could get Glenda Jackson, but she and Matthau had previously worked together in the 1978 film &quot;House Calls&quot;, and she was delighted with the prospect of working with him again.

===Filming===
&quot;Hopscotch&quot; was filmed in many locations in Europe and the United States, including London, United Kingdom; Marseilles, France; Bermuda; Washington, D.C.; Savannah, Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia; and Munich, in then-West Germany.

Locations in Salzburg, Austria, included The Mirabell Platz. The scenes set during Munich&#x27;s Oktoberfest were filmed using eight cameras concealed in strategic locations at the Munich Fairgrounds.

===Financing===
IFI and the Landaus raised money from cinema chains, which later caused problems with distribution for the film. IFI wanted Goldcrest Films to invest, as they had on &quot;The Howling&quot; and &quot;Escape from New York&quot; but David Puttnam persuaded the Goldcrest board otherwise. The film earned $20 million, including $9 million in rentals. Avco-Embassy executive Jake Eberts claimed that IFI did not make money on the film.

==Differences between novel and film==
Garfield&#x27;s original script reflected the dark tone of the novel. At one point, Warren Beatty and Jane Fonda were in line for the leads.

Matthau agreed to appear with the condition that Garfield rework the script to play to his own gifts as an actor. Matthau and Neame participated in the rewrites, which continued throughout the film. The AFI catalog refers to a &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; article describing two of Matthau&#x27;s significant contributions: the ending, in which Kendig disguises himself as a Sikh in order to visit a bookshop, and the scene in a Salzburg restaurant where Kendig and Isobel, apparently strangers, strike up a conversation about wine that reveals more and more about them and ends in a passionate kiss. The original scene relied on a great deal of exposition to bring the audience up to date. Neame said that Matthau contributed so much to the final film that he could have asked for credit, but that was never pursued.

The endings are very different. In the novel, Kendig fakes his own death using a body recovered from a Paris street and includes all copies of his manuscript, ensuring it will never be published. In the film, his escape airplane explodes in mid-air just as it heads over the English Channel and no body is recovered. His exposé is published and is a great success. Both works include a knowing nod from Cutter indicating that he is sure that Kendig is alive but hopes that he will stay dead. The character of Isobel, Kendig&#x27;s old flame, provides a romantic interest in the film. In the novel, his feelings for a hired pilot prove to him that he will find a new life outside the world of spycraft.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby gave the film a rave review. &quot;A lark, a comic cloak-and-dagger adventure ... a stylish, lighter-than-air vehicle that moves from Munich to Salzburg to Washington to the Deep South to Europe and back without once losing its breath. It is beautifully played by Mr. Matthau and Miss Jackson and by a supporting cast ... directed by Ronald Neame and scored largely by Mozart. My only reservation is that Miss Jackson isn&#x27;t on the screen enough.&quot;

At the time of its release, film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described the film as &quot;a picaresque comedy disguised as a thriller&quot;. &quot;A shaggy-dog thriller that never really thrills us very much, but leaves a nice feeling when it&#x27;s over ... partly because of the way Walter Matthau fools around with dialogue ... and partly because the movie&#x27;s shot at a measured, civilized, whimsical pace. It&#x27;s a strange thing to say about a thriller, but &quot;Hopscotch&quot; is ... pleasant.&quot;

TCM&#x27;s Susan Doll observed: &quot;For the most part, critical reaction to &quot;Hopscotch&quot; is dependent on the age of the reviewer&quot;, contrasting the reactions of &quot;critics (who) understand ... its value as a vehicle for Matthau, the appeal of a literate script, and the craftsmanship behind Neame&#x27;s measured style&quot;, and the responses of &quot;contemporary reviewers, accustomed to the violence of spy dramas and the fast pace of action films, (who) tend to be critical of its fluffy plot, dry humor, and lack of action scenes&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 81% based on 31 reviews The consensus reads: &quot;Boosted by a deftly underplayed performance from Walter Matthau, &quot;Hopscotch&quot; is a Cold War spy caper with comic bounce.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Criterion&quot; in 2002, Bruce Eder opens his assessment of the film with the statement that it &quot;has the distinction of being the only &#x27;feel-good&#x27; realistic spy film ever made. As the movie walks a fine line between serious drama and satirical comedy, and between topicality and escapism, it beguiles the viewer with its sophistication and complexity. The most surprising aspect of &quot;Hopscotch&quot;, however, may not be how well it walks that tightrope, but that its makers accomplished this balancing act in an era that saw the spy movie genre reduced to tales of relentless despair.&quot;

The film opened on 465 screens and grossed $2,552,864 in its opening weekend, debuting at number one at the US box office.

Matthau was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance as Miles Kendig.

<doc id="563047" wikidata="Q214394" url="?curid=563047" title="Oscar Hammerstein I">
<text>Oscar Hammerstein I (8 May 1846 – 1 August 1919) was a German-born businessman, theater impresario, and composer in New York City. His passion for opera led him to open several opera houses, and he rekindled opera&#x27;s popularity in America. He was the grandfather of American playwright/lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II and the father of theater manager William Hammerstein and American producer Arthur Hammerstein.

==Early life and education==
Oscar Hammerstein I was born in Stettin (capital of the province of Pomerania), Kingdom of Prussia in present-day Szczecin, Poland, to German Jewish parents Abraham and Berthe Hammerstein. He took up the flute, piano, and violin at an early age. His mother died when he was fifteen years old. During his youth, Hammerstein&#x27;s father wanted him to continue with his education and to specialize in subjects such as algebra, but Hammerstein wanted to pursue music. After Oscar went skating in a park one day, his father found out and whipped him as punishment, goading Hammerstein to flee his family. With the proceeds from the sale of his violin, Hammerstein purchased a ticket to Liverpool, from which he departed on a three-month-long cruise to the United States, arriving in New York City in 1864.

==Career==
===Cigar manufacturer===
Hammerstein made ends meet initially by working at a cigar factory on Pearl Street. He worked his way up to become a cigar maker himself, and also founded the United States Tobacco Journal. Hammerstein would eventually become the owner of at least 80 patents, with most of them related to the machines he invented for the cigar-making process. 

On 8 March 1881, Hammerstein received Patent No. 238,500 for his cigar-making machine. The initial machine sold for $6,000. Numerous improvements boosted its value to $200,000. Another of his inventions was a more efficient plumbing system after his kitchen sink sprang a leak.

Hammerstein&#x27;s best-known contribution to the cigar-making process was adding an air-suctioning component to cigar rollers. On 1 August 1882 he received Patent No. 261,849 for a method of using suction to hold wrappers of cigars and cigarettes in place on a table, enabling them to hold down tobacco leaves firmly so the leaves could be cut more cleanly - before being wrapped around the cigar or cigarette.

He became wealthy industrializing cigar manufacturing, and his tobacco fortune provided the money he used to pursue his theater interests. On 4 May 1920 he posthumously received Patent No. 1,338,768A for a new way to remove the mid-rib from tobacco leaves.

===Producer and impresario===
Hammerstein built his first theater, the Harlem Opera House, on 125th Street in 1889, along with 50 housing developments. His second theater, the Columbus Theatre, was built in 1890 on the same street, and featured light theatrical productions.

His third theater was the first Manhattan Opera House, built in 1893 on 34th Street. This failed as an opera house and was used, in partnership with Koster and Bial, to present variety shows. Hammerstein was displeased with the partnership to the point that it fell into bitterness: &quot;When I get through with you, everybody will forget there ever was a Koster and Bial. I will build a house the likes of which has never been seen in the whole world.&quot;

In 1895 he opened a fourth venue, the Olympia Theatre, on Longacre Square, where he presented a comic opera that he wrote himself, &quot;Santa Maria&quot; (1896). While it was positively received by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hammerstein&#x27;s personal experience was less than peaceful, with the production being plagued by cost overruns with the cast and scenery. In the end, Hammerstein cleared only one-tenth of the costs that were put into &quot;Santa Maria&quot;.

Nine years later, Longacre Square was renamed Times Square, and the area had become, through his efforts, a thriving theater district.

Hammerstein built three more theaters there, the Victoria Theatre (1899), which turned to vaudeville presentation in 1904 and was managed by his son, Willie Hammerstein before closing in 1915; the Theatre Republic was built in 1900 and leased to eccentric producer David Belasco in 1901, and the Lew Fields Theatre for Lew Fields (half of the Vaudeville team Weber and Fields, and the father of lyricist Dorothy Fields), in 1904. 

Oscar Hammerstein went bankrupt in 1898 and his Olympia theater was sold at auction, but this didn&#x27;t prevent him from simultaneously raising enough money to build the Victoria Theatre, which opened as a legitimate theater on March 3, 1899. On June 26, 1899, he opened a partially enclosed roof garden theater, the Venetian Terrace Garden, with an outdoor promenade that was attached to the roof garden of Hammerstein&#x27;s Theatre Republic. In 1900 Hammerstein enlarged the roof garden theater and reopened it in May 1901 as the Paradise Roof Garden. Collectively, the multiple performance venues in the building were known simply as &quot;Hammerstein&#x27;s&quot;.

He wrote a musical called &quot;Punch, Judy &amp; Co.&quot; in 1903.

===Opera===

In 1906, Hammerstein, dissatisfied with the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s productions, opened an eighth theater, his second Manhattan Opera House, to directly (and successfully) compete with it. He also opened the Philadelphia Opera House in 1908, which, however, he sold early in 1910.

He produced contemporary operas and presented the American premieres of &quot;Louise&quot;, &quot;Pelleas et Melisande&quot;, &quot;Elektra&quot;, &quot;Le jongleur de Notre-Dame&quot;, &quot;Thaïs&quot;, and &quot;Salome&quot;, as well as the American debuts of Mary Garden and Luisa Tetrazzini. Since the star soprano Nellie Melba was disenchanted with the Metropolitan, she deserted it for Hammerstein&#x27;s company, rescuing it financially with a successful season. He also produced the successful Victor Herbert operetta &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; in 1910.

Hammerstein became famous during his opera years for putting noticeably large budgets out for his productions, &quot;Santa Maria&quot; being one example. More often than not, he would fall into financial trouble within a short period of time. &quot;The New York Times&quot; conducted an interview with Hammerstein, and when the interviewer asked him about his financial habits, Hammerstein responded:

Financially, I never undertake anything without plenty of ammunition. I am never afraid of being ambushed in this account. I decided that my preliminary contracts should be drawn up provisionally upon my success in securing the great stars. I always contemplated an honorable retreat.

Hammerstein&#x27;s high-quality productions were ultimately too expensive to sustain, and by his fourth opera season, he was going bankrupt. The costs at the Metropolitan, too, were skyrocketing, as the Metropolitan spent more and more in order to effectively compete. Hammerstein&#x27;s son Arthur negotiated a payment of $1.2 million from the Metropolitan in exchange for an agreement not to produce grand opera in the United States for ten years.

With this money, Hammerstein built his tenth theater, the London Opera House, in London, where he again entered competition with an established opera house, Covent Garden&#x27;s Royal Opera House. He had run through his money in two years and thereupon returned to America. During a trip to Paris, a special cable was sent to him out of curiosity asking whether he wanted to quit opera in New York, given that during his 1909/1910 opera seasons in New York and Philadelphia, Hammerstein had failed in successfully maintaining audiences in his two venues in each city. He simply responded by saying, &quot;[Opera in New York is] what I&#x27;m here for. I can&#x27;t say anymore.&quot;

With money obtained selling the sole booking rights to the Victoria Theatre, he built his eleventh and final theatre, the &quot;Lexington Opera House.&quot; Unable to present opera there, he opened it as a movie theatre, selling it shortly thereafter. On 28 April 1910, Hammerstein officially ended producing opera, opting to solely focus on dramatic productions. All of his contracts and buildings of operation were turned over to the Metropolitan Opera Company.

Hammerstein&#x27;s first wife was Rosa (Rose) Blau. After Rosa died, he married Melvina Jacobi, who was born in New York City. The marriage took place on 7 December 1879 in Montgomery, Alabama. Melvina&#x27;s parents, Henrietta and Simon Jacobi, were Jews from Bavaria (possibly Grünstadt) who settled in New Orleans, Louisiana and, later, Montgomery, Alabama. Melvina and Oscar had two daughters – Rose and Estella (Stella).

===Legal problems===

Late in his career, Hammerstein experienced numerous legal setbacks, most of them pertaining to ownership of his opera houses, which he endured stoically.

One of his more infamous accusations was from a Frances Lee, an opera singer, who accused him of preventing her from singing in the Manhattan Opera House after one performance. Hammerstein was found not guilty and settled his possible payment for up to $35.

Hammerstein had given his two daughters, Stella and Rose Hammerstein, $200 a week for financial support after the death of his first wife. The payments were given to them by the Equitable Trust Company securely in exchange for stock shares in Hammerstein&#x27;s Victoria Theatre. In 1912, Hammerstein requested his stocks back from the company and chose to no longer pay for his daughters. Stella and Rose sought to fight against their father, who believed that they could support themselves on their own. Infamously, he compared paying his daughters to &quot;the eccentricities and actions of the late lamented King Lear.&quot;

==Death==
Hammerstein contracted kidney problems and paralysis, eventually permanently falling into a coma. He died in 1919 at Lenox Hill Hospital at Park Avenue and 77th Street in Manhattan. His contractual ban on presenting opera was due to expire in 1920; at his death, he was busy planning his return to the opera stage. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==
A 1910 song by Jack Norworth entitled &quot;For Months and Months and Months&quot; mentions Hammerstein in its first stanza.

The Manhattan Opera House was bid for $145,000 by Hammerstein&#x27;s two daughters. They would also sue Hammerstein&#x27;s third wife, Emma Swift Hammerstein, over money and ownership of the building. Emma Hammerstein would go to court claiming ownership through Hammerstein Opera Company stock, but the stocks were found to be null and void by the judge. The Manhattan Opera House on 34th Street in New York City was renamed the &quot;Hammerstein Ballroom&quot; at the Manhattan Center Studios in his honor.

Hammerstein&#x27;s son Arthur developed Hammerstein&#x27;s Theatre (now the Ed Sullivan Theater) at 1697 Broadway in his father&#x27;s honor. The theater opened on November 30, 1927.

<doc id="563054" wikidata="Q1634995" url="?curid=563054" title="Hugo Egon Balder">
<text>Hugo Egon Balder (born Egon Hugo Balder; 22 March 1950) is a German television presenter, producer, and comedian.

==Early life==
Balder was born in West Berlin to Egon Friedrich Balder (1904–1970) and Gerda Balder (née Schure; 1910–1997). Gerda Balder was Jewish who, together with her mother and her son from her first marriage, survived the Theresienstadt concentration camp.

Balder was a founding member of the Krautrock band Birth Control in 1968.

==Career==

Balder received acting training at a private acting school in Berlin from 1973 to 1976. Following that, he temporarily joined the ensemble of the Berliner Schillertheater. In 1985, he switched to the ensemble of the Düsseldorf cabaret Kom(m)ödchen, where he collaborated with Lore Lorentz and Harald Schmidt. Secondarily, he performed as a pop singer and had a notable success with his single &quot;Erna kommt&quot; (1985).

===Television===

Balder&#x27;s first roles as a show host were in various radio shows at Radio Luxembourg, until 1984, when he began to appear regularly on television (RTL). His popularity is mainly based on the shows &quot;Alles nichts oder?!&quot; and &quot;Tutti frutti&quot; which he hosted from 1988 until 1992 on RTL. As a producer, Balder was involved in the making of &quot;April, April&quot; (hosted by Frank Elstner) and &quot;RTL Samstag Nacht&quot;.

Currently, Balder works as the producer and show host of &quot;Genial daneben&quot; and the spin-off &quot;Genial daneben – Das Quiz&quot; on Sat.1.

==Personal life==
Balder is divorced (for the fourth time) and has two children.

<doc id="563055" wikidata="Q2554364" url="?curid=563055" title="Spanish nobility">
<text>The Spanish nobility are people who possess a title of nobility confirmed by the Spanish Ministry of the Presidency, Justice and Relations with the Cortes, as well as those individuals appointed to one of Spain&#x27;s three highest orders of knighthood: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of Charles III and the Order of Isabella the Catholic. Some members of the Spanish nobility possess various titles that may be inherited or not, but the creation and recognition of titles is legally the prerogative of the monarchy of Spain.

Many Spanish titles and noble families still exist and many have transmitted their aristocratic status since the Middle Ages. Some aristocratic families in Spain use the nobiliary particle &quot;de&quot; before their family name, although this was more prominent before the 20th century. 

Until 1923, noble titleholders in Spain were exempt from taxation; afterwards they were subject to it. During the rule of Francisco Franco in Spain (1939-1975), some new hereditary titles were conferred on individuals, and titles granted by Carlist pretenders were officially recognised. Despite Juan Carlos I&#x27;s ascension to the Spanish throne in 1975, the royal court of nobles holding positions and offices attached to the Royal Household of Spain was not restored. He maintained the practice of conferring titles, however, to recognize those whose public service, artistic endeavours, personal achievements, philanthropy, etc. were deemed to have benefitted the Spanish nation.

==Spanish nobility today==

As of 2023, there are approximately 2,237 titled nobles in Spain, and there are 418 Grandes de España, with 2,825 total titles of Spanish nobility. Some nobles may carry more than one title of nobility. Many are active in the worlds of business, finance, and technology, with some taking on leadership roles in major IBEX 35 companies, some of Spain&#x27;s largest companies. Examples include the president of FCC, Esther Alcocer Koplowitz, 9th Marchioness of Casa Peñalver, or Alfonso Martínez de Irujo Fitz-James Stuart, Duke of Híjar, president of IE Law School in Madrid.

===Legal situation===
In Spain today, the possession of a title of nobility does not imply any legal or fiscal privilege; the possession of titles of nobility is subject to the payment of a normal level of taxation. It is a distinction of merely honorary and symbolic character, accompanied by the treatment of &quot;the most excellent lord&quot; for those titles that possess the dignity of grandees of Spain and of &quot;illustrious lords&quot; for others. The last privilege, suppressed in 1984, was the right to a diplomatic passport by the Grandees of Spain (Grandes de España). This privilege disappeared by Royal Decree 1023/1984. The titles without the rank of grandee of Spain never enjoyed this privilege.

With the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, the use of noble titles was abolished by way of Decree of 1 June 1931, ratified by Law of 30 December of the same year. In 1948, legal recognition of the usage of noble titles was provided for by Law of 4 May 1948 restoring the rules as they were before 14 April 1931.

At present, titles of nobility find their legal basis in article 62, section f, of the 1978 constitution, which grants the prerogative of the king to grant honors and distinctions in accordance with the laws.

Spanish legislation recognizes titles of nobility and protects their legal owners against third parties. The Spanish nobility titles are in no case susceptible of purchase or sale, since their succession is strictly reserved for blood relatives of better right of the first holder of the title. The successions are processed by the Ministry of Justice and their use is subject to their respective tax.

The legal status of individual titles can be checked at La Diputación de la Grandeza de España y Títulos del Reino (DGET) and using Guía de Títulos in the Navigation bar.

==Classification of Spanish nobles==
Spanish nobles are classified as either grandees, as titled nobles, or as untitled nobles.

In the past, grandees were divided into first, second, and third classes, but this division has ceased to be relevant in practice while remaining a titular distinction; legally all grandees enjoy the same privileges in modern times. At one time however, each class held special privileges such as:
# those who spoke to the king and received his reply with their heads covered.
# those who addressed the king uncovered, but put on their hats to hear his answer.
# those who awaited the permission of the king before covering themselves.

Additionally, all grandees were addressed by the king as &quot;mi Primo&quot; (my Cousin), whereas ordinary nobles were only qualified as &quot;mi Pariente&quot; (my Kinsman).

An individual may hold a grandeeship, whether in possession of a title of nobility or not. Normally, however, each grandeeship is attached to a title. A grandeeship is always attached to the grant of a ducal title. The grant of a grandeeship with any other rank of nobility has always been at the will of the sovereign. Excepting dukes and some very ancient titles of marquesses and counts, most Spanish titles of nobility are not attached to grandeeships.

A grandee of any rank outranks a non-grandee, even if that non-grandee&#x27;s title is of a higher degree, with the exception of official members of the Spanish royal family who may in fact hold no title at all. Thus, a baron-grandee enjoys higher precedence than a marquess who is not a grandee.

Since 1987, the children of Spanish infantes, traditionally considered part of the royal family, have been entitled to the rank and style of a grandee but do not hold the legal dignity of grandee unless a &quot;grandeza&quot; is officially conferred by the sovereign; once the dignity has been officially bestowed, it becomes hereditary.

Some notable titles, which are attached to grandeeships, are: Duke of Alba, Duke of Medinaceli, Duke of Osuna, Duke of Infantado, Duke of Albuquerque, Duke of Nájera, Duke of Frías and Duke of Medina Sidonia, Marquess of Aguilar de Campoo, Marquess of Astorga, Marquess of Santillana, Marquess of Los Vélez, Count of Benavente, Count of Guaqui, Count of Lerín, Count of Olivares, Count of Oñate, and Count of Lemos.

==Form of address==
Dukes, Grandees, their spouses and heirs are entitled to the honorific style of &quot;The Most Excellent Lord/Lady&quot;.

Non-Grandee titled nobles, their spouses and offspring use the style of &quot;The Most Illustrious Lord/Lady&quot;.

==Ranks==
The ordinary Spanish nobility is divided into six ranks. From highest to lowest, these are: &quot;duque&quot; (duke), &quot;marqués&quot; (marquess), &quot;conde&quot; (count), &quot;vizconde&quot; (viscount), &quot;barón&quot; (baron), and &quot;señor&quot; (lord) (as well as the feminine forms of these titles).

Nobility descends from the first man of a family who was raised to the nobility (or recognized as belonging to the hereditary nobility) to all his legitimate descendants, male and female, in the male line (with some very few and notable exceptions). Thus, most persons who are legally noble hold no noble title. Hereditary titles formerly descended by male-preference primogeniture, a woman being eligible to inherit only if she had no brother or if her brothers also inherited titles. However, by Spanish law, all hereditary titles descend by absolute primogeniture, gender no longer being a criterion for preference in inheritance, since 2005.

On October 21, 2022, the Spanish authorities abolished 33 aristocratic titles:
In early October, the Senate (upper house of parliament) of Spain approved a bill on historical memory, declaring the dictatorship of Francisco Franco and the judicial decisions made under his regime illegal.

===Princes===

The often overlooked title of &#x27;prince&#x27; (&quot;príncipe/princesa&quot;) has historically been borne by those who have been granted or have inherited that title. It is often not included in lists of the Spanish nobility because it is rare. Prince/Princess are English translations of Infante/Infanta, referring to the son or daughter of a king; such titles are reserved for members of the royal family (the heir to the throne or the consort of the Queen regnant). Historically, infante or infanta could refer to offspring, siblings, uncles and aunts of a king. The heir&#x27;s princely titles derive from the ancient kingdoms which united to form Spain.

Three titles of prince are held by the heir to the Spanish throne.
* Prince of Asturias as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of Castile and León.
* Prince of Girona as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of Aragon.
* Prince of Viana as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of Navarre.

Other titles of &#x27;prince&#x27; were frequently granted by the kings of Spain, but usually in their capacity as kings of Naples or of Sicily. Such nobles often sojourned at the Spanish court where their titles were acknowledged, but rarely were Spanish nobles the recipients of a title of prince in Spain. The most notable exceptions were the title Prince of the Peace conferred in 1795 on Manuel Godoy, a favourite of the Spanish king and the title Prince of Vergara conferred to Baldomero Espartero. And Joseph Bonaparte conferred the title to be hereditary on his grandchildren in both the male and female line, Although legislation of the twentieth century ended official recognition of the title of prince outside the royal bloodline family, it did allow the holder of a princedom to have the dignity converted to a ducal title of the same name.
When military dictator Francisco Franco appointed Juan Carlos de Borbón as his heir apparent with the future title of king, he created the new titles of prince of Spain for him.

===Baron/Baroness (&quot;Barón&quot;/&quot;Baronesa&quot;)===

Baronies did not exist in the Kingdom of Castile nor the Kingdom of Navarre, and the subsequent kings of Spain did not confer any baronies attached to Castilian or Navarrese estates. However, they did exist in the Kingdom of Aragon, such as:
*Baron of Polop

===Lord/Lady (&quot;Señor&quot;/&quot;Señora&quot;) (&quot;Don&quot;/&quot;Doña&quot;)===

The title of &quot;Señor&quot; is, together with that of &quot;Conde&quot;, the oldest in seniority of the Spanish realms. Many of these lordships are among the oldest titles of nobility in Spain, and the &quot;señor&quot; usually exercised military and administrative powers over the lordship. Although some lordships were created by the kings of Spain, others existed before them and have not been created by any known king. For example, the lord of Biscay held a great degree of independence from the king of Castile, to whom he could pledge or not pledge feudal allegiance, but of whom he was not automatically a vassal: each new lord of Biscay had to renew his oath to the king. Ultimately, however, the kings of Castile inherited the lordship.

Besides those held by the King, in Spain remain seven lordships that maintain the official consideration of Titles of the Kingdom according to the Official Guide of the Titles and Grandees of the Kingdom published by the Ministry of Justice: the Lordship of Solar de Tejada, the Lordship of Solar de Mandayona y Villaseca, the Lordship of Alconchel, the Lordship of Lazcano (with Grandee of Spain), the Lordship of Rubianes (with Grandee of Spain), the Lordship of Higuera de Vargas (with Grandee of Spain), the Lordship of Meirás (with Grandee of Spain) and the Lordship of Sonseca. Other lordships that were considered as Titles of the Kingdom in the past, have not been rehabilitated.

*Lord of Alconchel
*Lord of Balaguer, held by the King of Spain
*Lord of Biscay, held by the Spanish monarchy since 1378, when merged with the previously semi-independent lordship of Biscay
*Lord of Higuera de Vargas
*Lord of Casa Lazcano
*Lady of Meirás, &quot;señora de Meiras&quot;, created for Carmen Polo, wife of Francisco Franco and abolished in 2022.
*Lord of Casa Rubianes
*Lord of Solar de Tejada
*Lord of Sonseca

===Other titles===

*Infante: currently borne by royal princes, other than the heir apparent to the throne, who are sons of a Spanish king.
*Knight of the Order of Charles III &quot;caballero de la Orden de Carlos III&quot;: the bestowal of the highest order of knighthood on an individual grants personal nobility and certain heraldic privileges such as a heraldic mantle. The King of Spain continues to bestow this honor. 
*Knight of the Royal Order of Isabella the Catholic &quot;caballero de la Orden de Isabel la Catolica&quot;: the bestowal of the second highest order of knighthood on an individual grants personal nobility and certain heraldic privileges such as a golden heraldic mantle. The King of Spain continues to bestow this honor. 
*ricohombre (fem. &quot;Ricahembra&quot;): used during the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. The transition from ricohombres to grandes occurred between 1390 and 1530 as the new &quot;noble oligarchy&quot; replaced the old one due to the change of power base caused by the conflict between infantes of Aragon and the supporters of John II of Castile with his favorite Álvaro de Luna. Alfonso de Cartagena in his &quot;Doctrinal de los caballeros&quot; ( 1441-1444), while discussing the grandes, states that the previous term &quot;ricohombres&quot; is &quot;old-fashioned&quot;. By the 17th century the term was used to describe any nobleman.
*Condestable: cognate with &quot;constable&quot;, it was a hereditary title used in the kingdoms of Castile and León for the official second in authority to the king. It became hereditary in the Velasco family which, however, gradually lost the powers once attributed to the &quot;Condestable&quot; of Castile.
*Caballero: equivalent to knight, it was very rare in the kingdom of Castile, but common in the kingdom of Aragon, where there were four types of &quot;caballeros&quot;:
**Golden-spur &quot;caballero&quot;: borne by those &quot;infanzones&quot; (descendants of one of the cadet branches of the kings of Aragon which did not inherit the throne) who had been knighted. They were the highest ranking knights.
**Royal-privilege &quot;caballero&quot;: a personal, non-hereditary title granted by the king to doctors of the law. It was rarely used by its holders, since the doctoral status enjoyed more privileges.
**&quot;Caballero Mesnadero&quot;: borne by the cadet sons of a &quot;ricohombre&quot;. It fell into desuetude during the 18th century, when the Bourbon kings purged the ranks of the nobility.
**&quot;Caballero franco&quot;: borne by those of &quot;hijosdalgo&quot; or &quot;infanzone&quot; status, but who were commoner-born.
*Potestad: borne only in the kingdom of Aragon, the equivalent of the Italian &quot;podestà&quot;, an administrative title. It disappeared with the Nueva Planta decrees in 1713.

===Lower nobility===
Lower nobility held ranks, without individual titles, such as (in Aragon, e.g. Latas Family), or . These did not, however, correspond to the status of a , a title unknown to Spanish nobility except in Catalonia.

 was the most common of these:
Originally all the nobles in the Western Peninsular Christian Realms were and, as (&quot;old Christians&quot;), held nearly exclusive right to privileged status (although there were some Jews and Muslims recognized as , who shared their privilege to bear arms as knights in the ). The first of the kings of Pamplona and Asturias were originally elected and lifted up on a shield to assume status, by these otherwise untitled nobles. For approximately three hundred years the retained this privilege, only a few of them eventually being granted the non-heritable title of . Unlike Spain&#x27;s later titled nobles, the early did not necessarily possess or receive any fief or land grant. Many were as poor as commoners, although they were tax-exempt and could join the civil service or the army.

During the Middle Ages became a title granted by the kings of Castile as a reward for service done to the crown (or, as in Biscay, as a way of recognizing prior rights). In the same way was granted for military achievement when the ended. Being the most obvious proof of noble descent, came to be the only lesser title to remain among the modern ranks of Spanish nobility. From this ancient estate of the realm emerged Spain&#x27;s nobility. All titled and untitled nobles are considered , but many of the modern titled nobility do not descend from the original .

The term indicated membership in a family whose noble status was recognized in the earliest records of its existence; thus its immemorial nobility was acknowledged but not created by any monarch.

==Succession==
The evidence supporting one&#x27;s claim to a title may be reviewed by the Council of Grandees and Titled Nobles of the Kingdom (&quot;Diputación de Grandes y Títulos del Reino&quot;). The body includes eight grandees, eight nobles who are not grandees, and a president who must hold both a grandeeship and a hereditary title unattached to a grandeeship.

Succession to Spanish noble titles is hereditary, but not automatic. The original letters patent which created the title determine the order of succession. Payment of substantial fees is required whenever a title is inherited.

While noble titles historically have followed the rule of male-preference primogeniture, a Spanish law came into effect on 30 October 2006, after approval by both houses of the &quot;Cortes&quot;, establishing the inheritance of hereditary noble titles by the firstborn regardless of gender. The law is retroactive to 27 July 2005.

Following the death of a noble, the senior heir may petition the sovereign through the Spanish Ministry of Justice for permission to use the title. If the senior heir does not make a petition within two years, then other potential heirs may do so on their own behalf. There is a limit of forty years from the vacancy by death or relinquishment of a title within which that title may be claimed and revived by an heir.

The petitioner must demonstrate that he or she is a child, grandchild or direct male line descendant of a noble (whether a grandee or not), or that he or she belongs to certain bodies or orders of chivalry deemed noble, or that the father&#x27;s family is recognized as noble. The amount of fees due depend on whether the title is attached to a grandeeship or not, and on whether the heir is a direct descendant or a collateral kinsman of the previous holder. The petition is normally granted, except if the petitioner is a criminal.

Titles may also be ceded to heirs other than the senior heir, during the lifetime of the main titleholder. Normally, this process is used to allow younger children to succeed to lesser titles, while the highest or principal title goes to the senior heir. Only subsidiary titles may be ceded; the principal title must be reserved for the senior heir. The cession of titles may only be done with the approval of the monarch.

The late Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, 18th Duchess of Alba (1926–2014) holds the Guinness World Record for number of titles with over 50 titles. Before her death, she ceded some of her titles to each of her six children; otherwise, all of them would have be inherited by the oldest.

==Alternative nobility==
The pretender Carlist branch of the Bourbons created its own titles for its supporters, unrecognized by the ruling Christinos branch.
When General Francisco Franco became head of state with the support of, among others, Carlist troops, Carlist titles became officially recognized.

== Titles created during the reign of King Juan Carlos ==

From the beginning of his reign in November 1975, King Juan Carlos created new titles for about 51 people (as of April 2011), among others recognizing the merits of politicians and artists. Some of these dignities have been hereditary. Examples include:
* Carmen Franco y Polo, daughter of dictator Francisco Franco, created 1st Duchess of Franco and Grandee of Spain in 1975
* Carlos Arias Navarro, Prime Minister, created 1st Marquess of Arias Navarro and Grandee of Spain in 1976
* Torcuato Fernández-Miranda, Prime Minister, created 1st Duke of Fernandez-Miranda and Grandee of Spain in 1977
* Adolfo Suárez, Prime Minister, created 1st Duke of Suárez and Grandee of Spain in 1981
* Andrés Segovia, classical guitarist, created 1st Marquess of Salobreña in 1981
* Salvador Dalí, surrealist painter, created 1st Marquess de Dalí de Púbol in 1982
* Joaquín Rodrigo, composer and pianist, created 1st Marquess de los Jardines de Aranjuez in 1991
* Juan Antonio Samaranch, President of the International Olympic Committee, created 1st Marquess of Samaranch and Grandee of Spain in 1991
* Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado, officer and politician, created 1st Marquess of Gutiérrez-Mellado in 1994
* Camilo José Cela, author and Nobel laureate, created 1st Marquess of Iria Flavia in 1996
* Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, Prime Minister, created 1st Marquess de la Ría of Ribadeo and Grandee of Spain in 2002
* Margarita Salas, scientist, created 1st Marchioness of Canero in 2008
* Paloma O&#x27;Shea Artiñano, pianist, created 1st Marchioness of O&#x27;Shea in 2008
* José Ángel Sánchez Asiaín, an international banker, created 1st Marquess of Asiaín in 2010
* Antoni Tàpies, painter, created 1st Marquess of Tàpies in 2010
* Vicente del Bosque, football manager, created 1st Marquess of Del Bosque in 2011
* Mario Vargas Llosa, author and Nobel laureate, created 1st Marquess of Vargas Llosa in 2011.

King Juan Carlos also exceptionally confirmed the title of Count of Barcelona, a title historically attached to the Crown, but used as a title of pretence by his father, Infante Juan, during the dynasty&#x27;s 20th century exile and the subsequent reign of his son.

== Titles created during the reign of King Felipe VI ==
King Felipe VI has not yet created any new titles of nobility. He has, however, revived the dukedom of Fernandina, the marquisate of Murillo, and the county of Torre Alegre; and has reverted the dukedom of Palma Mallorca to the crown, formerly belonging to his elder sister, Infanta Cristina of Spain, over a corruption enquiry.

<doc id="563056" wikidata="Q6639724" url="?curid=563056" title="List of software patents">
<text>This is a list of software patents, which contains notable patents and patent applications involving computer programs (also known as a software patent). Software patents cover a wide range of topics and there is therefore important debate about whether such subject-matter should be excluded from patent protection. However, there is no official way of identifying software patents and different researchers have devised their own ways of doing so.

This article lists patents relating to software which have been the subject of litigation or have achieved notoriety in other ways. Notable patent applications are also listed and comparisons made between corresponding patents and patent applications in different countries. The patents and patent applications are categorised according to the subject matter of the patent or the particular field in which the patent had an effect that brought it into the public view.

== Business methods ==


==Data compression==

===Data compression in general===
* &quot;(Main article: Stac Electronics)&quot;
* also granted as - now expired
: Stac Electronics sued Microsoft for patent infringement when Microsoft introduced the DoubleSpace data compression scheme into MS-DOS. Stac was awarded $120 million by a jury in 1994 and Microsoft was ordered to recall versions of MS-DOS with the infringing technology.

===Audio compression===
* &quot;(Main article: MP3)&quot;
: One of several patents covering the MP3 format owned by the Fraunhofer Society which led to the development of the Ogg Vorbis format as an alternative to MP3.

* &quot;(Main article: Alcatel-Lucent v. Microsoft)&quot;
:Two patents owned by Alcatel-Lucent relating to MP3 technology under which they sued Microsoft for $1.5 billion. Microsoft thought they had already licensed the technology from Fraunhofer, and this case illustrates one of the basic principles of patents that a license does not necessarily permit the licensee to work the technology, but merely prevents the licensee from being sued by the licensor.

===Image compression===
* (&quot;Main article: GIF&quot;)
: Unisys&#x27;s patent on LZW compression, a fundamental part of the widely used GIF graphics format.
* and its EP equivalent 
*(&quot;Main article: Forgent Networks&quot;)
: Forgent Networks claimed this patent, granted in 1987, covered the JPEG image compression format. The broadest claims of the US patent were found to be invalid in 2005 following re-examination by the US Patent and Trademark Office.
* 

: This patent, owned by Lizardtech, Inc., was the subject of infringement proceedings against companies including Earth Resource Mapping, Inc. However, Lizardtech lost the trial on the grounds that an important part of their invention was the step of &quot;&quot;maintaining updated sums of discrete wavelet transform coefficients&quot; from the discrete tile image to form a seamless discrete wavelet transform of the image&quot;. Claim 21 of the patent lacked this feature and was therefore obvious. The remaining claims contained this feature, but were not infringed by ERM. Internet buzz suggested the patent covered the JPEG 2000 image compression format but the additional feature of the valid claims appears not to be a JPEG 2000 requirement.

===Video compression===

==Data encryption==

==Gaming systems==
* (&quot;Main article: Menashe v. William Hill&quot;)
:A patent for a gaming system that has particular importance regarding Internet usage. A server running the game was located outside the UK but could be used within the UK. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales judged that the patent was being infringed by virtue of the sale of CDs in the UK containing software intended to put the invention into effect in the UK.

==Image processing==
* also granted as - (&quot;Main article: Photographic mosaic&quot;)
: Robert Silver&#x27;s patent on his photographic mosaicing technique. The UK part of the European patent is currently undergoing revocation proceedings, the results of which may be important in comparing the practice of the UK Patent Office with that of the European Patent Office.
* (&quot;Main article: Shadow volume&quot;)
: A patent covering the technique commonly known as Carmack&#x27;s Reverse

==Internet tools==

==Fair division==
* - &quot;(Main article: Adjusted winner procedure)&quot;
:An algorithm to divide &quot;n&quot; divisible goods between two parties as fairly as possible.

==Search engines==
* (&quot;Main article: Yahoo! Search Marketing&quot;)
: A patent relating to pay-per-click Internet search engine advertising. Originally filed by Goto.com, Inc. (renamed Overture Services, Inc.), Google and FindWhat were both sued for infringement prior to Overture&#x27;s acquisition by Yahoo!

==Telecommunications==
:Washington Research Foundation asserted this patent in December 2006 against Matsushita (owners of the Panasonic brand), Nokia and Samsung. Granted in October 2006 (originating from a 1996 filing) it relates to dynamically varying the passband bandwidth of a tuner. If the claims had been upheld, CSR plc (previously known as Cambridge Silicon Radio), who supply the defendants with Bluetooth chips, could have lost market share to Broadcom who already had a license under the patent.
: One of three patents granted in respect of Karmarkar&#x27;s algorithm, which relates to linear programming problems. Claim 1 of this patent suggests the algorithm should be applied to the allocation of telecommunication transmission facilities among subscribers.

==User interfaces==
* and related to 
: Immersion Corporation sued Sony under these US patents in 2002. They relate to force-feedback technology such as that used in PlayStation 2 DualShock controllers. Sony lost the case and Immersion were awarded $90.7 million, an injunction (stayed pending appeal), and a compulsory license. The claims of the related European patent application require the device to be &quot;attached&quot; to a body part and were, in any event, refused by the examining division of the European Patent Office for lacking an inventive step.
* 
:The patent relates to a progress bar. Filed in 1989, it was highlighted in 2005 by Richard Stallman in &quot;New Scientist&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; as an example of a software patent granted by the European Patent Office, that would impede software development and would be dangerous. The claims as granted describe a process of breaking down a task to be performed by a computer into a number of equal task units and updating a display each time a unit is completed and therefore does not cover progress bars which operate in different ways.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== Notable due to proprietor hyperbole ===
: Owned at various times by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. and Compton&#x27;s NewMedia, Inc. this patent was granted in August 1993. Just a few months later, in November 1993, Compton&#x27;s announced that &quot;Everything that is now multimedia and computer-based utilizes this invention&quot; and tried to use the patent to ensure that everyone licensed their software. Although a cursory review of the granted claims showed this statement to be mere hyperbole, there was nonetheless an outcry from the industry and the patent was revoked following re-examination.
* and 
: Patents owned by Scientigo and claimed by them to cover the markup language XML, a notion rejected by patent attorneys and other commentators including Microsoft.

=== Notable due to misconception ===
* &quot;Emoticon keyboard button patent application.&quot;
:Early in 2006, rumours circulated on the Internet that Cingular Wireless had patented the emoticon and, in particular, had patented the concept of using emoticons on mobile phones. This resulted in a great deal of anger directed at the US Patent Office that such patents should never have been granted. Ultimately, it was pointed out that it was only a published patent application, not a granted patent, and that the claims of the patent application actually related to a mobile phone with a dedicated button for inserting emoticons.
:This patent application is currently being examined by the US patent office. All of the originally filed claims were rejected on 22 February 2007 as being known or obvious, although the rejection was not final. Examination of the corresponding European patent application also suggested that the claims lacked an inventive step, and the application lapsed in 2010.
:This design patent was granted to Google on 1 September 2009 for the simple and clean appearance of their homepage from five years earlier. Referred to in the media as a patent, it received criticism for not being as original as Google&#x27;s web search technology and was held up as evidence that the US patent system was broken. The New York Post said that Google now had the right to sue anyone who used a similarly no-frills website. However, a &quot;design patent&quot; is not the same as a &quot;patent&quot; (sometimes referred to as a &quot;utility patent&quot;) since it provides only limited protection for ornamental appearance. Design patents are typically hard to infringe and even Google&#x27;s own homepage at the time the design patent was granted was almost certainly different enough from the design patent that it did not infringe it.

<text>Sat.1 () is a German free-to-air television channel that is a part of the ProSiebenSat.1 Media Group. 

It is considered the first privately owned television network in Germany, having been launched in January 1984 as &quot;PKS&quot; &quot;(Programmgesellschaft für Kabel- und Satellitenrundfunk)&quot;, initially a joint venture of various publishing houses, and was rebranded as Sat.1 in January 1985. The first broadcast could only be seen by roughly 1200 households who had cable access in the city of Ludwigshafen. Early programs included old films (mainly from the archives of KirchMedia) American hit series and game shows (the most notable show being the German version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Glücksrad&quot;). Later, the station acquired a name for its original series and TV films. By 1988, it was the most watched tv channel in West Germany.

Pay-TV sister channel &quot;Sat.1 Emotions&quot; (formerly &quot;Sat.1 Comedy&quot;) airs comedy, romance and movies. In 2013 &quot;Sat.1 Gold&quot;, a second, free-to-air Sat.1 offshoot was also launched.

In addition to its free-to-air standard definition feed, Sat.1 also broadcasts an HD feed as a subscription-only channel, available on Astra&#x27;s HD+ satellite pay-TV platform.

<doc id="563067" wikidata="Q367109" url="?curid=563067" title="Jan Potocki">
<text>Count Jan Potocki (; 8 March 1761 – 23 December 1815) was a Polish nobleman, ethnologist, linguist, traveller and author of the Enlightenment period, whose life and exploits made him a celebrated figure in Poland. He is known chiefly for his picaresque novel, &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot;.

Born into affluent Polish nobility, Potocki lived abroad from an early age and was primarily educated in Switzerland. He frequently visited the salons of Paris and toured Europe before temporarily returning to Poland in 1778. As a soldier, he fought in Austrian ranks in the War of the Bavarian Succession, and in 1789 was appointed a military engineer in the Polish army. During his extensive voyages he actively documented prevailing customs, ongoing wars, revolutions and national awakenings, which made him a pioneer of travel literature. Fascinated by the occult, Potocki studied ancient cultures, rituals and secret societies. Simultaneously, he was a member of parliament and took part in the Great Sejm shortly before the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist.

In spite of his literary career, Potocki became burdened by mental illness and melancholy. He committed suicide by gunshot in 1815; however, the circumstances of his death remain controversial to this day.

==Life==
Jan Potocki was born into the Potocki aristocratic family, that owned vast estates across Poland. He was educated in Geneva and Lausanne, served twice in the Polish Army as a captain of engineers, and spent some time on a galley as novice to the Knights of Malta. His colorful life took him across Europe, Asia and North Africa, where he embroiled himself in political intrigues, flirted with secret societies and contributed to the birth of ethnology – he was one of the first to study the precursors of the Slavic peoples from a linguistic and historical standpoint.

In 1790 he became the first person in Poland to fly in a hot air balloon when he made an ascent over Warsaw with the aeronaut Jean-Pierre Blanchard, an exploit that earned him great public acclaim. He spent some time in France, and upon his return to Poland, he became a known publicist, publishing newspapers and pamphlets, in which he argued for various reforms. He also established in 1788 in Warsaw a publishing house named &quot;Drukarnia Wolna&quot; (Free Press) as well as the city&#x27;s first free reading room. His relation with Stanislaus Augustus was thorny, as Potocki, while often supportive of the king, on occasion did not shy from his critique. He was also highly critical of the Russian ambassador, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg.

Potocki&#x27;s wealth enabled him to travel extensively about Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia, visiting Italy, Sicily, Malta, the Netherlands, Germany, France, England, Russia, Turkey, Dalmatia, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Spain, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and even Mongolia. He was also one of the first travel writers of the modern era, penning lively accounts of many of his journeys, during which he also undertook extensive historical, linguistic, and ethnographic studies.

Potocki married twice and had five children. His first marriage ended in divorce, and both marriages were the subject of scandalous rumors. In 1812, disillusioned and in poor health, he retired to his estate at Uładówka (now Uladivka) near Vinnytsia in present-day Ukraine, suffering from &quot;melancholia&quot; (which today would probably be diagnosed as depression), and during the last few years of his life he completed his novel.

==&quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot;==
Potocki&#x27;s most famous work, originally written in French, is &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot; (&quot;Manuscrit trouvé à Saragosse&quot;). It is a frame tale. On account of its rich, interlocking structure, and telescoping story sequences, the novel has drawn comparisons to such celebrated works as the &quot;Decameron&quot; and the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;.

The book&#x27;s title is explained in the foreword, which is narrated by an unnamed French officer who describes his fortuitous discovery of an intriguing Spanish manuscript during the sack of Zaragoza in 1809, in the course of the Napoleonic Wars. Soon after, the French officer is captured by the Spanish and stripped of his possessions; but a Spanish officer recognizes the manuscript&#x27;s importance, and during the French officer&#x27;s captivity the Spaniard translates it for him into French.

The manuscript has been written by a young officer of the Walloon Guard, Alphonse van Worden. In 1739, while &quot;en route&quot; to Madrid to serve with the Spanish Army, he is diverted into Spain&#x27;s rugged Sierra Morena region. There, over a period of sixty-six days, he encounters a varied group of characters, including Muslim princesses, Gypsies, outlaws, and kabbalists, who tell him an intertwining series of bizarre, amusing, and fantastic tales which he records in his diary.

The sixty-six stories cover a wide range of themes, subjects, and styles, including gothic horror, picaresque adventures, and comic, erotic, and moral tales. The stories reflect Potocki&#x27;s interest in secret societies, the supernatural, and oriental cultures, and they are illustrated with his detailed observations of 18th-century European manners and customs, particularly those of upper-class Spanish society.

Many of the locations described in the tales are real places and regions which Potocki would have visited during his travels, while others are fictionalized accounts of actual places.

While there is still some dispute about the novel&#x27;s authorship, it is now generally accepted to have indeed been written by Potocki. He began writing it in the 1790s and completed it in 1814, a year before his death, though the novel&#x27;s structure is thought to have been fully mapped out by 1805.

The novel was never published in its entirety during Potocki&#x27;s lifetime. A proof edition of the first ten &quot;days&quot; was circulated in Saint Petersburg in 1805, and a second extract was published in Paris in 1813, almost certainly with Potocki&#x27;s permission. A third publication, combining both earlier extracts, was issued in 1814, but it appears that at the time of his death Potocki had not yet decided on the novel&#x27;s final form.

Potocki composed the book entirely in the French language. Sections of the original manuscripts were later lost, but have survived in a Polish translation that was made in 1847 by Edmund Chojecki from a complete French copy, now lost.

The most recent and complete French-language version, edited by François Rosset and Dominique Triaire, was published in 2006 in Leuven, Belgium, as part of a critical scholarly edition of the complete works of Potocki. Unlike Radrizzani&#x27;s 1989 edition of the &quot;Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot;, Rosset and Triaire&#x27;s edition has been based solely on Potocki&#x27;s French-language manuscripts found in several libraries in France, Poland (in particular, previously unknown autograph pieces that they discovered in Poznań), Spain, and Russia, as well as in the private collection of Potocki&#x27;s heirs. They identified two versions of the novel: one unfinished, of 1804, published in 1805, and the full version of 1810, which appears to have been completely reconceived in comparison to the 1804 version. Whereas the first version has a lighter, more sceptical tone, the second one tends towards a darker, more religious mood. In view of the differences between the two versions, the 1804 and 1810 versions have been published as two separate books; paperback editions were issued in early 2008 by Flammarion.

The first English-language edition, published in 1995, was a translation of Radrizzani&#x27;s edition by Oxford scholar Ian MacLean. Potocki&#x27;s novel became more widely known thanks to the stylish black-and-white 1965 film adaptation directed by renowned filmmaker Wojciech Has and starring Zbigniew Cybulski as Alphonse van Worden.

<text>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF or GCSF), also known as colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF 3), is a glycoprotein that stimulates the bone marrow to produce granulocytes and stem cells and release them into the bloodstream.

Functionally, it is a cytokine and hormone, a type of colony-stimulating factor, and is produced by a number of different tissues. The pharmaceutical analogs of naturally occurring G-CSF are called filgrastim and lenograstim.

G-CSF also stimulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of neutrophil precursors and mature neutrophils.

== Biological function ==
G-CSF is produced by endothelium, macrophages, and a number of other immune cells. The natural human glycoprotein exists in two forms, a 174- and 177-amino-acid-long protein of molecular weight 19,600 grams per mole. The more-abundant and more-active 174-amino acid form has been used in the development of pharmaceutical products by recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology.

;White blood cells: The G-CSF-receptor is present on precursor cells in the bone marrow, and, in response to stimulation by G-CSF, initiates proliferation and differentiation into mature granulocytes. G-CSF stimulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of neutrophil precursors and mature neutrophils. G-CSF regulates them using Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signal transduction pathway.

;Hematopoietic System: G-CSF is also a potent inducer of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, although it has been shown that it does not directly affect the hematopoietic progenitors that are mobilized.

;Neurons: G-CSF can also act on neuronal cells as a neurotrophic factor. Indeed, its receptor is expressed by neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The action of G-CSF in the central nervous system is to induce neurogenesis, to increase the neuroplasticity and to counteract apoptosis. These properties are currently under investigations for the development of treatments of neurological diseases such as cerebral ischemia.

==Genetics==
The gene for G-CSF is located on chromosome 17, locus q11.2-q12. Nagata et al. found that the GCSF gene has four introns, and that two different polypeptides are synthesized from the same gene by differential splicing of mRNA.
The two polypeptides differ by the presence or absence of three amino acids. Expression studies indicate that both have authentic GCSF activity.

It is thought that stability of the G-CSF mRNA is regulated by an RNA element called the G-CSF factor stem-loop destabilising element.

== Medical use ==
===Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia===

Chemotherapy can cause myelosuppression and unacceptably low levels of white blood cells (leukopenia), making patients susceptible to infections and sepsis. G-CSF stimulates the production of granulocytes, a type of white blood cell. In oncology and hematology, a recombinant form of G-CSF is used with certain cancer patients to accelerate recovery and reduce mortality from neutropenia after chemotherapy, allowing higher-intensity treatment regimens. It is administered to oncology patients via subcutaneous or intravenous routes. A QSP model of neutrophil production and a PK/PD model of a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drug (Zalypsis) have been developed to optimize the use of G-CSF in chemotherapy regimens with the aim to prevent mild-neutropenia.

G-CSF was first trialled as a therapy for neutropenia induced by chemotherapy in 1988. The treatment was well tolerated and a dose-dependent rise in circulating neutrophils was noted.

A study in mice has shown that G-CSF may decrease bone mineral density.

G-CSF administration has been shown to attenuate the telomere loss associated with chemotherapy.

===Use in drug-induced neutropenia===
Neutropenia can be a severe side effect of clozapine, an antipsychotic medication in the treatment of schizophrenia. G-CSF can restore neutrophil count. Following a return to baseline after stopping the drug, it may sometimes be safely rechallenged with the added use of G-CSF.

===Before blood donation===
G-CSF is also used to increase the number of hematopoietic stem cells in the blood of the donor before collection by leukapheresis for use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For this purpose, G-CSF appears to be safe in pregnancy during implantation as well as during the second and third trimesters. Breastfeeding should be withheld for three days after CSF administration to allow for clearance of it from the milk. People who have been administered colony-stimulating factors do not have a higher risk of leukemia than people who have not.

===Stem cell transplants===
G-CSF may also be given to the receiver in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, to compensate for conditioning regimens.

==Side effect==
The skin disease Sweet&#x27;s syndrome is a known side effect of using this drug.

== History ==
Two research teams independently identified mouse colony stimulating factors in the 1960s: Ray Bradley at University of Melbourne and Donald Metcalf at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, from Australia, and Yasuo Ichikawa, Dov Pluznik and Leo Sachs at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. In 1980 Antony Burgess and Donald Metcalf discovered that mouse lung conditioned medium contained at least two different CSFs - GM-CSF, which they had purified in 1977 and a G-CSF which stimulated the production of 
colonies of neutrophils. 

In 1983, Donald Metcalf&#x27;s research team, led by Nicos Nicola, isolated the murine cytokine from medium conditioned with lung tissue obtained from endotoxin-treated mice.

In 1985, Karl Welte, Erich Platzer, Janice Gabrilove, Roland Mertelsmann and Malcolm Moore at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) purified human G-CSF produced by bladder cancer cell line 5637 from conditioned medium.

In 1986, Karl Welte&#x27;s team at MSK patented the method of producing and using human G-CSF under the name &quot;human hematopoietic pluripotent colony stimulating factor&quot; or &quot;human pluripotent colony stimulating factor&quot; (P-CSF). Also in 1986, two independent research groups working with pharmaceutical companies cloned the G-CSF gene that made possible large-scale production and its clinical use: Shigekazu Nagata&#x27;s team in collaboration with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. from Japan, and Lawrence Souza&#x27;s team at Amgen in collaboration with Karl Welte&#x27;s research team members from Germany and the USA.

==Pharmaceutical variants==
The recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) synthesised in an &quot;E. coli&quot; expression system is called filgrastim. The structure of filgrastim differs slightly from the structure of the natural glycoprotein. Most published studies have used filgrastim.

The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) first approved filgrastim on February 20, 1991 marketed by Amgen with the brand name Neupogen. It was initially approved to reduce the risk of infection in patients with non-myeloid malignancies who are taking myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with febrile neutropenia with fever.

Several bio-generic versions are now also available in markets such as Europe and Australia. Filgrastim (Neupogen) and PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta), or pegylated form of filgratim, are two commercially available forms of rhG-CSF. The pegylated form of filgratim form has a much longer half-life, reducing the necessity of daily injections.

The FDA approved the first biosimilar of Neulasta in June 2018. It is made by Mylan and sold as Fulphila.

Another form of rhG-CSF called lenograstim is synthesised in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells). As this is a mammalian cell expression system, lenograstim is indistinguishable from the 174-amino acid natural human G-CSF. No clinical or therapeutic consequences of the differences between filgrastim and lenograstim have yet been identified, but there are no formal comparative studies.

In 2015, filgrastim was included on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, a list containing the medications considered to be most effective and safe to meet the most important needs in a health system.

===Research===
G-CSF when given early after exposure to radiation may improve white blood cell counts, and is stockpiled for use in radiation incidents.

Mesoblast planned in 2004 to use G-CSF to treat heart degeneration by injecting it into the blood-stream, plus SDF (stromal cell-derived factor) directly to the heart.

G-CSF has been shown to reduce inflammation, reduce amyloid beta burden, and reverse cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Due to its neuroprotective properties, G-CSF is currently under investigation for cerebral ischemia in a clinical phase IIb and several clinical pilot studies are published for other neurological disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis A combination of human G-CSF and cord blood cells has been shown to reduce impairment from chronic traumatic brain injury in rats.

<doc id="563074" wikidata="Q2366175" url="?curid=563074" title="Sundaland">
<text>Sundaland (also called Sundaica or the Sundaic region) is a biogeographical region of Southeast Asia corresponding to a larger landmass that was exposed throughout the last 2.6 million years during periods when sea levels were lower. It includes Bali, Borneo, Java, and Sumatra in Indonesia, and their surrounding small islands, as well as the Malay Peninsula on the Asian mainland.

==Extent==
The area of Sundaland encompasses the Sunda Shelf, a tectonically stable extension of Southeast Asia&#x27;s continental shelf that was exposed during glacial periods of the last 2 million years.

The extent of the Sunda Shelf is approximately equal to the 120-meter isobath. In addition to the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra, it includes the Java Sea, the Gulf of Thailand, and portions of the South China Sea. In total, the area of Sundaland is approximately 1,800,000 km2. The area of exposed land in Sundaland has fluctuated considerably during the past recent 2 million years; the modern land area is approximately half of its maximum extent.

The western and southern borders of Sundaland are clearly marked by the deeper waters of the Sunda Trench – some of the deepest in the world – and the Indian Ocean. The eastern boundary of Sundaland is the Wallace Line, identified by Alfred Russel Wallace as the eastern boundary of the range of Asia&#x27;s land mammal fauna, and thus the boundary of the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. The islands east of the Wallace line are known as Wallacea, a separate biogeographical region that is considered part of Australasia. The Wallace Line corresponds to a deep-water channel that has never been crossed by any land bridges. The northern border of Sundaland is more difficult to define in bathymetric terms; a phytogeographic transition at approximately 9ºN is considered to be the northern boundary.

Greater portions of Sundaland were most recently exposed during the last glacial period from approximately 110,000 to 12,000 years ago. When the sea level was decreased by 30–40 meters or more, land bridges connected the islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra to the Malay Peninsula and mainland Asia. Because the sea level was 30 meters or more lower throughout much of the last 800,000 years, the current status of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra as islands has been a relatively rare occurrence throughout the Pleistocene. In contrast, the sea level was higher during the late Pliocene, and the exposed area of Sundaland was smaller than what is observed at present. Sundaland was partially submerged starting around 18,000 years ago and continuing until about 5000 BC. During the Last Glacial Maximum the sea level fell by approximately 120 meters, and the entire Sunda Shelf was exposed.

==Modern climate==
All of Sundaland is within the tropics; the equator runs through central Sumatra and Borneo. Like elsewhere in the tropics, rainfall, rather than temperature, is the major determinant of regional variation. Most of Sundaland is classified as perhumid, or everwet, with over 2,000 millimeters of rain annually; rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration throughout the year and there are no predictable dry seasons like elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

The warm and shallow seas of the Sunda Shelf (averaging 28 °C or more) are part of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool/Western Pacific Warm Pool and an important driver of the Hadley circulation and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), particularly in January when it is a major heat source to the atmosphere. ENSO also has a major influence on the climate of Sundaland; strong positive ENSO events result in droughts throughout Sundaland and tropical Asia.

==Modern ecology==
The high rainfall supports closed canopy evergreen forests throughout the islands of Sundaland, transitioning to deciduous forest and savanna woodland with increasing latitude. The remaining primary (unlogged) lowland forest is known for giant dipterocarp trees and orangutans; after logging, forest structure and community composition change to be dominated by shade intolerant trees and shrubs. Dipterocarps are notable for mast fruiting events, where tree fruiting is synchronized at unpredictable intervals resulting in predator satiation. Higher elevation forests are shorter and dominated by trees in the oak family. Botanists often include Sundaland, the adjacent Philippines, Wallacea and New Guinea in a single floristic province of Malesia, based on similarities in their flora, which is predominantly of Asian origin.

During the last glacial period, sea levels were lower and all of Sundaland was an extension of the Asian continent. As a result, the modern islands of Sundaland are home to many Asian mammals including elephants, monkeys, apes, tigers, tapirs, and rhinoceros. The flooding of Sundaland separated species that had once shared the same environment. One example is the river threadfin (&quot;Polydactylus macrophthalmus&quot;, Bleeker 1858), which once thrived in a river system now called &quot;North Sunda River&quot; or &quot;Molengraaff river&quot;. The fish is now found in the Kapuas River on the island of Borneo, and in the Musi and Batanghari rivers in Sumatra. Selective pressure (in some cases resulting in extinction) has operated differently on each of the islands of Sundaland, and as a consequence, a different assemblage of mammals is found on each island. However, the current species assemblage on each island is not simply a subset of a universal Sundaland or Asian fauna, as the species that inhabited Sundaland before flooding did not all have ranges encompassing the entire Sunda Shelf. Island area and number of terrestrial mammal species are related, with the largest islands of Sundaland (Borneo and Sumatra) having the highest diversity.

==History==

===Early research===
The name &quot;Sunda&quot; goes back to antiquity, appearing in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, written around 150 AD. In an 1852 publication, English navigator George Windsor Earl advanced the idea of a &quot;Great Asiatic Bank&quot;, based in part on common features of mammals found in Java, Borneo and Sumatra.

Explorers and scientists began measuring and mapping the seas of Southeast Asia in the 1870s, primarily using depth sounding. In 1921 Gustaaf Molengraaff, a Dutch geologist, postulated that the nearly uniform sea depths of the shelf indicated an ancient peneplain that was the result of repeated flooding events as ice caps melted, with the peneplain becoming more perfect with each successive flooding event. Molengraaff also identified ancient, now submerged, drainage systems that drained the area during periods of lower sea levels.

The name &quot;Sundaland&quot; for the peninsular shelf was first proposed by Reinout Willem van Bemmelen in his &quot;Geography of Indonesia&quot; in 1949, based on his research during World War II. The ancient drainage systems described by Molengraaff were verified and mapped by Tjia in 1980 and described in greater detail by Emmel and Curray in 1982 complete with river deltas, floodplains and backswamps.

===Data types===
The climate and ecology of Sundaland throughout the Quaternary has been investigated by analyzing foraminiferal &quot;δ&quot;18O and pollen from cores drilled into the ocean bed, &quot;δ&quot;18O in speleothems from caves, and &quot;δ&quot;13C and &quot;δ&quot;15N in bat guano from caves, as well as species distribution models, phylogenetic analysis, and community structure and species richness analysis.

===Climate===
Perhumid climate has existed in Sundaland since the early Miocene; though there is evidence for several periods of drier conditions, a perhumid core persisted in Borneo. The presence of fossil coral reefs dating to the late Miocene and early Pliocene suggests that, as the Indian monsoon grew more intense, seasonality increased in some portions of Sundaland during these epochs. Palynological evidence from Sumatra suggests that temperatures were cooler during the late Pleistocene; mean annual temperatures at high elevation sites may have been as much as 5 °C cooler than present.

Most recent research agrees that Indo-Pacific sea surface temperatures were at most 2-3 °C lower during the Last Glacial Maximum. Snow was found much lower than at present (approximately 1,000 meters lower) and there is evidence that glaciers existed on Borneo and Sumatra around 10,000 years before present. However, debate continues on how precipitation regimes changed throughout the Quaternary. Some authors argue that rainfall decreased with the area of ocean available for evaporation as sea levels fell with ice sheet expansion. Others posit that changes in precipitation have been minimal and an increase in land area in the Sunda Shelf alone (due to lowered sea level) is not enough to decrease precipitation in the region.

One possible explanation for the lack of agreement on hydrologic change throughout the Quaternary is that there was significant heterogeneity in climate during the Last Glacial Maximum throughout Indonesia. Alternatively, the physical and chemical processes that underlie the method of inferring precipitation from &quot;δ&quot;18O records may have operated differently in the past. Some authors working primarily with pollen records have also noted the difficulties of using vegetation records to detect changes in precipitation regimes in such a humid environment, as water is not a limiting factor in community assemblage.

===Ecology===
Sundaland, and in particular Borneo, has been an evolutionary hotspot for biodiversity since the early Miocene due to repeated immigration and vicariance events. The modern islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra have served as refugia for the flora and fauna of Sundaland during multiple glacial periods in the last million years, and are serving the same role at present.
==== Savanna corridor theory ====
Dipterocarp trees characteristic of modern Southeast Asian tropical rainforest have been present in Sundaland since before the Last Glacial Maximum. There is also evidence for savanna vegetation, particularly in now submerged areas of Sundaland, throughout the last glacial period. However, researchers disagree on the spatial extent of savanna that was present in Sundaland. There are two opposing theories about the vegetation of Sundaland, particularly during the last glacial period: (1) that there was a continuous savanna corridor connecting modern mainland Asia to the islands of Java and Borneo, and (2) that the vegetation of Sundaland was instead dominated by tropical rainforest, with only small, discontinuous patches of savanna vegetation.

The presence of a savanna corridor—even if fragmented—would have allowed for savanna-dwelling fauna (as well as early humans) to disperse between Sundaland and the Indochinese biogeographic region; emergence of a savanna corridor during glacial periods and subsequent disappearance during interglacial periods would have facilitated speciation through both vicariance (allopatric speciation) and geodispersal. Morley and Flenley (1987) and Heaney (1991) were the first to postulate the existence of a continuous corridor of savanna vegetation through the center of Sundaland (from the modern Malay Peninsula to Borneo) during the last glacial period, based on palynological evidence. Using the modern distribution of primates, termites, rodents, and other species, other researchers infer that the extent of tropical forest contracted—replaced by savanna and open forest —during the last glacial period. Vegetation models using data from climate simulations show varying degrees of forest contraction; Bird et al. (2005) noted that although no single model predicts a continuous savanna corridor through Sundaland, many do predict open vegetation between modern Java and southern Borneo. Combined with other evidence, they suggest that a 50–150 kilometer wide savanna corridor ran down the Malay Peninsula, through Sumatra and Java, and across to Borneo. Additionally, Wurster et al. (2010) analyzed stable carbon isotope composition in bat guano deposits in Sundaland and found strong evidence for the expansion of savanna in Sundaland. Similarly, stable isotope composition of fossil mammal teeth supports the existence of the savanna corridor.

In contrast, other authors argue that Sundaland was primarily covered by tropical rainforest. Using species distribution models, Raes et al. (2014) suggest that Dipterocarp rainforest persisted throughout the last glacial period. Others have observed that the submerged rivers of the Sunda Shelf have obvious, incised meanders, which would have been maintained by trees on river banks. Pollen records from sediment cores around Sundaland are contradictory; for example, cores from highland sites suggest that forest cover persisted throughout the last glacial period, but other cores from the region show pollen from savanna-woodland species increasing through glacial periods. And in contrast to previous findings, Wurster et al. (2017) again used stable carbon isotope analysis of bat guano, but found that at some sites rainforest cover was maintained through much of the last glacial period. Soil type, rather than long-term existence of a savanna corridor, has also been posited as an explanation for species distribution differences within Sundaland; Slik et al. (2011) suggest that the sandy soils of the now submerged seabed are a more likely dispersal barrier.

====Paleofauna====
Before Sundaland emerged during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene (~2.4 million years ago), there were no mammals on Java. As sea level lowered, species such as the dwarf elephantoid &quot;Sinomastodon bumiajuensis&quot; colonized Sundaland from mainland Asia. Later fauna included tigers, Sumatran rhinoceros, and Indian elephant, which were found throughout Sundaland; smaller animals were also able to disperse across the region.

==Human migrations==
According to the most widely accepted theory, the ancestors of the modern-day Austronesian populations of the Maritime Southeast Asia and adjacent regions are believed to have migrated southward, from the East Asia mainland to Taiwan, and then to the rest of Maritime Southeast Asia. An alternative theory points to the now-submerged Sundaland as the possible cradle of Austronesian languages: thus the &quot;Out of Sundaland&quot; theory. However, this view is an extreme minority view among professional archaeologists, linguists, and geneticists. The Out of Taiwan model (though not necessarily the Express Train Out of Taiwan model) is accepted by the vast majority of professional researchers.

A study from Leeds University and published in &quot;Molecular Biology and Evolution&quot;, examining mitochondrial DNA lineages, suggested that shared ancestry between Taiwan and Southeast Asian resulted from earlier migrations. Population dispersals seem to have occurred at the same time as sea levels rose, which may have resulted in migrations from the Philippine Islands to as far north as Taiwan within the last 10,000 years.

The population migrations were most likely to have been driven by climate change — the effects of the drowning of an ancient continent. Rising sea levels in three massive pulses may have caused flooding and the submerging of the Sunda continent, creating the Java and South China Seas and the thousands of islands that make up Indonesia and the Philippines today. The changing sea levels would have caused these humans to move away from their coastal homes and culture, and farther inland throughout southeast Asia. This forced migration would have caused these humans to adapt to the new forest and mountainous environments, developing farms and domestication, and becoming the predecessors to future human populations in these regions.

Genetic similarities were found between populations throughout Asia and an increase in genetic diversity from northern to southern latitudes. Although the Chinese population is very large, it has less variation than the smaller number of individuals living in Southeast Asia, because the Chinese expansion occurred fairly recently, from the mid to late-Holocene.

Stephen Oppenheimer locates the origin of the Austronesians in Sundaland and its upper regions. From the standpoint of historical linguistics, the home of the Austronesian languages is the main island of Taiwan, also known by its unofficial Portuguese name of Formosa; on this island the deepest divisions in Austronesian are found, among the families of the native Formosan languages.

<doc id="563077" wikidata="Q5273942" url="?curid=563077" title="Dictatorships and Double Standards">
<text>&quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards&quot; is an essay by Jeane Kirkpatrick published in the November 1979 issue of &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, which criticized the foreign policy of the Carter administration. It is also the title of a 270-page book written by Kirkpatrick in 1982.

The article in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine in 1979 is credited with leading directly to Kirkpatrick&#x27;s becoming an adviser to Ronald Reagan and thus her appointment as United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Hence, the views expressed in Kirkpatrick&#x27;s essay influenced the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, particularly with regard to Latin America.

Kirkpatrick argued that by demanding rapid liberalization in traditionally autocratic countries, the Carter administration and previous administrations had delivered those countries to anti-American opposition groups that proved more repressive than the governments they overthrew. She further accused the administration of a &quot;double standard&quot; in that it had never applied its rhetoric on the necessity of liberalization to the affairs of Communist governments.

The essay compares traditional autocracies and Communist regimes: 

Kirkpatrick concluded that while the United States should encourage liberalization and democracy in autocratic countries, it should not do so when the government is facing violent overthrow and should expect gradual change rather than immediate transformation.

== Criticism ==
AFL–CIO&#x27;s Tom Kahn criticized conceptual problems and strategic consequences in Kirkpatrick&#x27;s analysis. In particular, Kahn suggested that policy should promote democracy even in the countries dominated by Soviet communism. Kahn argued that the Polish labor-union Solidarity deserved United States support and even in its first years demonstrated that civil society could expand and that free labor unions could be organized despite Communist regimes. Kirkpatrick&#x27;s analysis of Communism underestimated the democratic potential of the working class.

Ted Galen Carpenter of the Cato Institute noted that while Communist movements tend to depose rival authoritarians, the traditional authoritarian regimes supported by the United States came to power by overthrowing democracies. Thus, he concludes that while Communist regimes are more difficult to eradicate, traditional autocratic regimes &quot;pose the more lethal threat to functioning democracies&quot;.

<text>Sir William Arthur Lewis (23 January 1915 – 15 June 1991) was a Saint Lucian economist and the James Madison Professor of Political Economy at Princeton University. Lewis was known for his contributions in the field of economic development. In 1979, he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

==Biography==
Arthur Lewis was born in Castries, Saint Lucia, then still part of the British Windward Islands federal colony, the fourth of the five sons of George Ferdinand and Ida Lewis (the others being Stanley, Earl, Allen and Victor). His parents had migrated from Antigua shortly after the turn of the century. George Lewis died when Arthur was seven years old and his brothers aged from five to 17, leaving Ida to raise her five children alone. Arthur was a gifted student and was promoted two classes ahead of his age. After finishing school when he was 14 years old, Lewis worked as a clerk, while waiting to be old enough to sit the examination for a government scholarship to a British university, which would be in 1932. During this time he began a lifelong friendship with Eric Williams, the future first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago.

Lewis&#x27;s initial career choice was to become an engineer, &quot;but this seemed pointless since neither the government nor the white firms would employ a black engineer,&quot; as he later said: &quot;Eventually I decided to study business administration, planning to return to St. Lucia for a job in the municipal service or in private trade. I would simultaneously study law to fall back on if nothing administrative turned up.&quot; At the age of 18, he earned the government scholarship to attend the London School of Economics (LSE), becoming the first black individual to gain acceptance there. While enrolled to study for a Bachelor of Commerce degree (&quot;which offered accounting, business management, commercial law and a little economics and statistics&quot;) in 1933, he would achieve similar success as he did at grade school. While at LSE, he studied under John Hicks, Arnold Plant, Lionel Robbins, and Friedrich Hayek.

After Lewis graduated in 1937 with first-class honours, LSE gave him a scholarship to read for a PhD in industrial economics, under the supervision of Arnold Plant. Lewis would become the first black faculty member at LSE: in 1938 he was given a teaching appointment, and in 1939 was made an Assistant Lecturer, continuing to work as a member of the LSE staff until 1948.

In 1947, Lewis married Gladys Jacobs, and that year he was selected as a lecturer at the Victoria University of Manchester, and moved there with his family, becoming Britain&#x27;s first black lecturer. In 1948, at the age of 33, he was made a full professor. He taught at Manchester until 1957. During this period, he developed some of his most important concepts about the patterns of capital and wages in developing countries. He particularly became known for his contributions to development economics, of great interest as former colonies began to gain independence from their European colonizers.

Lewis served as an economic advisor to numerous African and Caribbean governments, including Nigeria, Ghana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, and Barbados. When Ghana (where in 1929 his eldest brother Stanley had settled) gained independence in 1957, Lewis was appointed as the country&#x27;s first economic advisor. He helped draw up its first Five-Year Development Plan (1959–1963).

In 1959, Lewis returned to the Caribbean region when appointed Vice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962. In 1963, he was knighted by the British government for his achievements and for his contributions to economics. That year, he was also appointed Professor of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University – the first black instructor to be given a full professorship – and subsequently held the position of James Madison Professor of Political Economics. In 1966, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He also served from 1966 to 1973 he served as Chancellor of the University of Guyana. Lewis worked at Princeton for the next two decades, teaching generations of students until his retirement in 1983. Lewis helped to establish the Caribbean Development Bank and in 1970 he was selected as its first president, serving in that capacity until 1973.

Lewis received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1979, sharing it with Theodore Schultz, &quot;for their pioneering research into economic development research with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries&quot;.

Lewis died on 15 June 1991 in Bridgetown, Barbados, aged 76. He was buried in the grounds of the St. Lucian community college named in his honour.

==Personal life==
In 1947, Lewis married Grenada-born Gladys Jacobs, with whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth and Barbara.

==Key works==
===&quot;Labour in the West Indies: The Birth of a Workers&#x27; Movement&quot; (1939)===
&quot;Labour in the West Indies: The Birth of a Worker&#x27;s Movement&quot;, first published by the Fabian Society in 1939, was an account of the 1930s labour movement in the Caribbean. It remained the only work published on the Caribbean-wide movement and the Labour Rebellions in the English-speaking Caribbean for decades. The book was republished by John La Rose and Sarah White at New Beacon Books in February 1978. Lewis is now characterised as &quot;among the earliest proponents of Reparations for the former West Indies for Britain&#x27;s colonial wrongs&quot; because of the ideas he put forward in this work.

===The &quot;Lewis model&quot;===

Lewis published in 1954 what was to be his most influential development economics article, &quot;Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour&quot; (Manchester School). In this publication, he introduced what came to be called the dual sector model, or the &quot;Lewis model&quot;.

Lewis combined an analysis of the historical experience of developed countries with the central ideas of the classical economists to produce a broad picture of the development process. In his theory, a &quot;capitalist&quot; sector develops by taking labour from a non-capitalist backward &quot;subsistence&quot; sector. The subsistence sector is governed by informal institutions and social norms so that producers do not maximize profits and workers can be paid above their marginal product. At an early stage of development, the &quot;unlimited&quot; supply of labour from the subsistence economy means that the capitalist sector can expand for some time without the need to raise wages. This results in higher returns to capital, which are reinvested in capital accumulation. In turn, the increase in the capital stock leads the &quot;capitalists&quot; to expand employment by drawing further labour from the subsistence sector. Given the assumptions of the model (for example, that the profits are reinvested and that capital accumulation does not substitute for skilled labour in production), the process becomes self-sustaining and leads to modernization and economic development.

The point at which the excess labour in the subsistence sector is fully absorbed into the modern sector, and where further capital accumulation begins to push the balance of power towards labour (thus increasing wages) in both capitalist and subsistence sectors, is sometimes called the Lewisian turning point. It has recently been widely discussed in the context of economic development in China. Work building on Lewis&#x27;s analysis has shown that productivity gains in the areas formerly occupied by the subsistence sector (e.g. agriculture) can offset some of the labour demand.

===&quot;The Theory of Economic Growth&quot; (1955)===
In his 1955 book, &quot;The Theory of Economic Growth&quot;, Lewis sought to &quot;provide an appropriate framework for studying economic development&quot;, driven by a combination of &quot;curiosity and of practical need.&quot;

During the Industrial Revolution, England was experiencing the worst economic turmoil of its time. It would not be until an economic enlightenment took place that cities began to shift towards factories and labour-intensive methods of production as they experienced giant shifts in the labour and agriculture markets, thus, eventually leading to higher production, and higher income. Lewis theorized if England could turn its misfortune around, the same could be done for developing countries around the world. His theories proved true for some countries such as Nigeria and Barbados, as they would see some economic development.

=== &quot;Politics in West Africa&quot; (1965) ===
In his 1965 book, &quot;Politics in West Africa&quot;, Lewis examines the weakness of opposition parties in West African states. He criticizes the majoritarian winner-takes-all model of politics, arguing that while it may work in European and American contexts, it cannot in the context of many African states. The reason for this is that African states are divided on linguistic and tribal lines, making it hard for peaceful co-existence between groups when one group controls the central government. Lewis argues powersharing needs to be facilitated, which he argues can be best done through proportional representation, federalism and coalition governments. Democracy can be maintained through institutional design more suited to the cleavages of African states.

<doc id="563084" wikidata="Q738958" url="?curid=563084" title="Lyrical Ballads">
<text>Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems is a collection of poems by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, first published in 1798 and generally considered to have marked the beginning of the English Romantic movement in literature. The immediate effect on critics was modest, but it became and remains a landmark, changing the course of English literature and poetry. The 1800 edition is famous for the &quot;Preface to the Lyrical Ballads&quot;, something that has come to be known as the manifesto of Romanticism.

Most of the poems in the 1798 edition were written by Wordsworth, with Coleridge contributing only four poems to the collection (although these made about a third of the book in length), including one of his most famous works, &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.

A second edition was published in 1800, in which Wordsworth included additional poems and a preface detailing the pair&#x27;s avowed poetical principles. For another edition, published in 1802, Wordsworth added an appendix titled &quot;Poetic Diction&quot; in which he expanded the ideas set forth in the preface. A third edition was published in 1802, with substantial additions made to its &quot;Preface,&quot; and a fourth edition was published in 1805.

==Content==
Wordsworth and Coleridge set out to overturn what they considered the priggish, learned, and highly sculpted forms of 18th-century English poetry and to make poetry accessible to the average person via verse written in common, everyday language. These two major poets emphasise the vitality of the living voice used by the poor to express their reality. This language also helps assert the universality of human emotions. Even the title of the collection recalls rustic forms of art – the word &quot;lyrical&quot; links the poems with the ancient rustic bards and lends an air of spontaneity, while &quot;ballads&quot; are an oral mode of storytelling used by the common people.

In the &#x27;Advertisement&#x27; included in the 1798 edition, Wordsworth explained his poetical concept:
The majority of the following poems are to be considered as experiments. They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to the purpose of poetic pleasure. 
If the experiment with vernacular language was not enough of a departure from the norm, the focus on simple, uneducated country people as the &quot;subject&quot; of poetry was a signal shift to modern literature.
One of the main themes of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; is the return to the original state of nature, in which people led a purer and more innocent existence. Wordsworth subscribed to Rousseau&#x27;s belief that humanity was essentially good but was corrupted by the influence of society. This may be linked with the sentiments spreading through Europe just prior to the French Revolution.

In the 1798 edition the poems later printed as &quot;Lines Written When Sailing in a Boat at Evening&quot; and &quot;Lines Written Near Richmond, Upon the Thames&quot; form a single poem, &quot;Lines Written Near Richmond, Upon the Thames, at Evening&quot;.

<doc id="563086" wikidata="Q223143" url="?curid=563086" title="Granulocyte">
<text>Granulocytes are cells in the innate immune system characterized by the presence of specific granules in their cytoplasm. Such granules distinguish them from the various agranulocytes. All myeloblastic granulocytes are polymorphonuclear, that is, they have varying shapes (morphology) of the nucleus (segmented, irregular; often lobed into three segments); and are referred to as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, PML, or PMNL). In common terms, &quot;polymorphonuclear granulocyte&quot; refers specifically to &quot;neutrophil granulocytes&quot;, the most abundant of the granulocytes; the other types (eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells) have varying morphology. Granulocytes are produced via granulopoiesis in the bone marrow.

==Types==

There are four types of granulocytes (full name polymorphonuclear granulocytes):
* Basophils
* Eosinophils
* Neutrophils
* Mast cells

Except for the mast cells, their names are derived from their staining characteristics; for example, the most abundant granulocyte is the neutrophil granulocyte, which has neutrally staining cytoplasmic granules.

===Neutrophils===
Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, constituting 60% to 65% of the total circulating white blood cells, and consisting of two subpopulations: neutrophil-killers and neutrophil-cagers. One litre of human blood contains about five billion (5x109) neutrophils, which are about 12–15 micrometres in diameter. Once neutrophils have received the appropriate signals, it takes them about thirty minutes to leave the blood and reach the site of an infection. Neutrophils do not return to the blood; they turn into pus cells and die. Mature neutrophils are smaller than monocytes, and have a segmented nucleus with several sections(two to five segments); each section is connected by chromatin filaments. Neutrophils do not normally exit the bone marrow until maturity, but during an infection neutrophil precursors called myelocytes and promyelocytes are released.

Neutrophils have three strategies for directly attacking micro-organisms: phagocytosis (ingestion), release of soluble anti-microbials (including granule proteins), and generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).
Neutrophils are professional phagocytes: they are ferocious eaters and rapidly engulf invaders coated with antibodies and complement, as well as damaged cells or cellular debris. The intracellular granules of the human neutrophil have long been recognized for their protein-destroying and bactericidal properties. Neutrophils can secrete products that stimulate monocytes and macrophages; these secretions increase phagocytosis and the formation of reactive oxygen compounds involved in intracellular killing.

Neutrophils have two types of granules; primary (azurophilic) granules (found in young cells) and secondary (specific) granules (which are found in more mature cells). Primary granules contain cationic proteins and defensins that are used to kill bacteria, proteolytic enzymes and cathepsin G to break down (bacterial) proteins, lysozyme to break down bacterial cell walls, and myeloperoxidase (used to generate toxic bacteria-killing substances). In addition, secretions from the primary granules of neutrophils stimulate the phagocytosis of IgG antibody-coated bacteria. The secondary granules contain compounds that are involved in the formation of toxic oxygen compounds, lysozyme, and lactoferrin (used to take essential iron from bacteria). Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) comprise a web of fibers composed of chromatin and serine proteases that trap and kill microbes extracellularly. Trapping of bacteria is a particularly important role for NETs in sepsis, where NET are formed within blood vessels.

===Eosinophils===

Eosinophils also have kidney-shaped lobed nuclei (two to four lobes). The number of granules in an eosinophil can vary because they have a tendency to degranulate while in the blood stream. Eosinophils play a crucial part in the killing of parasites (e.g., enteric nematodes) because their granules contain a unique, toxic basic protein and cationic protein (e.g., cathepsin); receptors that bind to IgG and IgA are used to help with this task. These cells also have a limited ability to participate in phagocytosis, they are professional antigen-presenting cells, they regulate other immune cell functions (e.g., CD4+ T cell, dendritic cell, B cell, mast cell, neutrophil, and basophil functions), they are involved in the destruction of tumor cells, and they promote the repair of damaged tissue. A polypeptide called interleukin-5 interacts with eosinophils and causes them to grow and differentiate; this polypeptide is produced by basophils and by T-helper 2 cells (TH2).

=== Basophils ===

Basophils are one of the least abundant cells in bone marrow and blood (occurring at less than two percent of all cells). Like neutrophils and eosinophils, they have lobed nuclei; however, they have only two lobes, and the chromatin filaments that connect them are not very visible. Basophils have receptors that can bind to IgE, IgG, complement, and histamine. The cytoplasm of basophils contains a varied amount of granules; these granules are usually numerous enough to partially conceal the nucleus. Granule contents of basophils are abundant with histamine, heparin, chondroitin sulfate, peroxidase, platelet-activating factor, and other substances.

When an infection occurs, mature basophils will be released from the bone marrow and travel to the site of infection. When basophils are injured, they will release histamine, which contributes to the inflammatory response that helps fight invading organisms. Histamine causes dilation and increased permeability of capillaries close to the basophil. Injured basophils and other leukocytes will release another substance called prostaglandins that contributes to an increased blood flow to the site of infection. Both of these mechanisms allow blood-clotting elements to be delivered to the infected area (this begins the recovery process and blocks the travel of microbes to other parts of the body). Increased permeability of the inflamed tissue also allows for more phagocyte migration to the site of infection so that they can consume microbes.

===Mast cells===

Mast cells are a type of granulocyte that are present in tissues; they mediate host defense against pathogens (e.g., parasites) and allergic reactions, particularly anaphylaxis. Mast cells are also involved in mediating inflammation and autoimmunity as well as mediating and regulating neuroimmune system responses, it release histamine

==Development==
Granulocytes are derived from stem cells residing in the bone marrow. The differentiation of these stem cells from multipotent hematopoietic stem cell into granulocytes is termed granulopoiesis. Multiple intermediate cell types exist in this differentiation process, including myeloblasts and promyelocytes.

== Function ==
===Granule contents===
Examples of toxic materials produced or released by degranulation by granulocytes on the ingestion of microorganisms are:
* Antimicrobial agents (Defensins and Eosinophil cationic protein)
* Enzymes
** Lysozyme: dissolves cell walls of some gram-positive bacteria
** Acid hydrolases: further digest bacteria
* Low pH vesicles (3.5-4.0)
* Toxic nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide)
* Toxic oxygen-derived products (e.g., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxy radicals, singlet oxygen, hypohalite)

==Clinical significance==
Granulocytopenia is an abnormally low concentration of granulocytes in the blood. This condition reduces the body&#x27;s resistance to many infections. Closely related terms include agranulocytosis (etymologically, &quot;no granulocytes at all&quot;; clinically, granulocyte levels less than 5% of normal) and neutropenia (deficiency of neutrophil granulocytes). Granulocytes live only one to two days in circulation (four days in spleen or other tissue), so transfusion of granulocytes as a therapeutic strategy would confer a very short-lasting benefit. In addition, there are many complications associated with such a procedure.

There is usually a granulocyte chemotactic defect in individuals suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Research suggests giving granulocyte transfusions to prevent infections decreased the number of people who had a bacterial or fungal infection in the blood. Further research suggests participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions show no difference in clinical reversal of concurrent infection.

<text>In medicine, granulocytosis is the presence of an increased number of granulocytes in the peripheral blood. Often, the word refers to an increased neutrophil granulocyte count (neutrophilia), but granulocytosis formally refers to the combination of neutrophilia, eosinophilia, and basophilia. Leukocytosis refers to an increase in the number of all white blood cells.

==Causes==
Granulocytosis can be a feature of a number of diseases, including:
* Infection, especially bacterial
* Malignancy, most notably leukemia (it is the main feature of chronic myelogenous leukemia, CML)
* Autoimmune disease

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of granulocytosis is usually done by obtaining a complete blood count.

==Prognostic==
In cardiovascular disease, increased white blood cell counts have been shown to indicate a worse prognosis.

* Bandemia

<text>Frank Klees (born March 6, 1951) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2014. He was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

==Background==
Klees was born in Landau, West Germany. His parents were Danube Swabians, German pioneers whose ancestors settled in parts of eastern Europe that would later be known as Hungary and Yugoslavia. At the age of five, Klees came with his family to Canada and settled in Leamington, Ontario. He worked as a businessman in the financial services sector with Canada Life Assurance. He then became an entrepreneur, and started a sports agency which represented professional athletes. Klees also co-founded the Municipal Gas Corporation in 1990, and served as its executive vice-president until 1997.

Klees sat on the board of the controversial Universal Energy Corporation, a natural gas and electricity retailer which has been fined by the Ontario Energy Board on several occasions and frequently criticised by its own customers as being a scam. When Universal was bought out by Just Energy he was presented a seat on the board of their Exchange corporation.

From 1992 to 1994, he was third vice-president and policy chair of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. Klees lives in Aurora, Ontario.

Klees is currently a registered lobbyist working on behalf of the development industry.

==Politics==
Klees ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1975 provincial election, losing to Liberal Remo Mancini in the southwestern riding of Essex South. He lost to Mancini a second time in the 1977 election.

Klees was elected to the legislature in the election of 1995, defeating former Liberal leadership candidate Charles Beer in York—Mackenzie. He was easily re-elected in the 1999 provincial election running in the new riding of Oak Ridges. On June 17, 1999 he was appointed to the cabinet of Premier Mike Harris as Chief Government Whip, Deputy House Leader and Minister without Portfolio.

In 2000, Klees was preparing to run as a candidate for the leadership of the new Canadian Alliance, but withdrew because one of his key financial backers insisted on a last-minute deal to make a significant funding commitment conditional on Klees throwing his support to one of the other candidates on the second ballot.

Klees stepped down from his ministerial position on July 30, 2001 for what he described as personal reasons. After returning to the backbenches for a year, he was reappointed to cabinet on October 3, 2002 as Minister of Tourism under Harris&#x27; successor, Ernie Eves. On February 25, 2003, he became Minister of Transportation, and served in that position until the defeat of the Eves government in the October 2003 election.

Klees was re-elected in 2003, and was a candidate in the 2004 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election which took place on September 18, 2004. He was endorsed by Tory MPPs Jerry Ouellette, Ted Chudleigh and Bill Murdoch, and groups such as the Conservative Youth Coalition. The other candidates in the race were Whitby-Ajax MPP Jim Flaherty and former Rogers Communications CEO John Tory. Klees made healthcare his biggest priority in the campaign. He was the only candidate to openly endorse a semi-privatized health care system. Other key issues of his campaign were school choice, physical education in the school system, OHIP statements, and foreign-trained doctors applying for employment. Klees was eliminated from the contest after placing third on the first ballot; Tory subsequently won on the second ballot. Klees increased his profile during the campaign, and became the Critic for Education and Citizenship &amp; Immigration in the Legislature as well as a member of the Justice Committee.

Klees was elected in the newly created provincial riding of Newmarket-Aurora in the 2007 Ontario general election. He was re-elected in the 2011 Ontario election.

Klees contested the 2009 leadership race, placing second behind the winner, Tim Hudak. The single biggest campaign contribution of $32,000 was made by OPTUS Capital Corporation, owned by Universal Energy Corporation&#x27;s founder and CEO Mark Silver. It accounted for 20% of the total contributions. Klees made a &quot;surprisingly impolitic concession speech&quot;, and it was reported that he had a cool relationship with Hudak, in part because Klees supported Tory as party leader while Hudak refused.

After the 2011 general election Klees requested the post of deputy party leader, presently held by Whitby-Oshawa MPP Christine Elliott, but Tim Hudak instead offered the shadow cabinet role of transportation critic along with ethnic outreach in the PC party&#x27;s shadow cabinet, which Klees turned down. On October 25, 2011, Klees announced that he would run for Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, in defiance of the opposition party leaders who had earlier ordered their members not to contest the Speakership. The minority Liberal government was one seat short of forming a majority and if Klees had been elected Speaker, he would have given the government a working majority as the speaker usually votes with the government in motions of non-confidence. The move was met with derision from other Conservatives with one MPP saying, &quot;This is the equivalent of crossing the floor... The Liberals better support him, because Frank doesn’t have a lot of friends in our caucus today.&quot; Klees withdrew his candidacy on October 29, 2011 due to lack of support.

He did not run in the 2014 election.

<doc id="563093" wikidata="Q14873666" url="?curid=563093" title="Paracrine signaling">
<text>In cellular biology, paracrine signaling is a form of cell signaling, a type of cellular communication in which a cell produces a signal to induce changes in nearby cells, altering the behaviour of those cells. Signaling molecules known as paracrine factors diffuse over a relatively short distance (local action), as opposed to cell signaling by endocrine factors, hormones which travel considerably longer distances via the circulatory system; juxtacrine interactions; and autocrine signaling. Cells that produce paracrine factors secrete them into the immediate extracellular environment. Factors then travel to nearby cells in which the gradient of factor received determines the outcome. However, the exact distance that paracrine factors can travel is not certain.

Although paracrine signaling elicits a diverse array of responses in the induced cells, most paracrine factors utilize a relatively streamlined set of receptors and pathways. In fact, different organs in the body - even between different species - are known to utilize a similar sets of paracrine factors in differential development. The highly conserved receptors and pathways can be organized into four major families based on similar structures: fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, Hedgehog family, Wnt family, and TGF-β superfamily. Binding of a paracrine factor to its respective receptor initiates signal transduction cascades, eliciting different responses.

==Paracrine factors induce competent responders==
In order for paracrine factors to successfully induce a response in the receiving cell, that cell must have the appropriate receptors available on the cell membrane to receive the signals, also known as being competent. Additionally, the responding cell must also have the ability to be mechanistically induced.

==Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family==
Although the FGF family of paracrine factors has a broad range of functions, major findings support the idea that they primarily stimulate proliferation and differentiation. To fulfill many diverse functions, FGFs can be alternatively spliced or even have different initiation codons to create hundreds of different FGF isoforms.

One of the most important functions of the FGF receptors (FGFR) is in limb development. This signaling involves nine different alternatively spliced isoforms of the receptor. &quot;Fgf&quot;8 and &quot;Fgf&quot;10 are two of the critical players in limb development. In the forelimb initiation and limb growth in mice, axial (lengthwise) cues from the intermediate mesoderm produces &quot;Tbx&quot;5, which subsequently signals to the same mesoderm to produce &quot;Fgf&quot;10. &quot;Fgf&quot;10 then signals to the ectoderm to begin production of &quot;Fgf&quot;8, which also stimulates the production of &quot;Fgf&quot;10. Deletion of &quot;Fgf&quot;10 results in limbless mice.

Additionally, paracrine signaling of Fgf is essential in the developing eye of chicks. The &quot;fgf&quot;8 mRNA becomes localized in what differentiates into the neural retina of the optic cup. These cells are in contact with the outer ectoderm cells, which will eventually become the lens.

Phenotype and survival of mice after knockout of some FGFR genes:
===Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway===
Paracrine signaling through fibroblast growth factors and its respective receptors utilizes the receptor tyrosine pathway. This signaling pathway has been highly studied, using &quot;Drosophila&quot; eyes and human cancers.

Binding of FGF to FGFR phosphorylates the idle kinase and activates the RTK pathway. This pathway begins at the cell membrane surface, where a ligand binds to its specific receptor. Ligands that bind to RTKs include fibroblast growth factors, epidermal growth factors, platelet-derived growth factors, and stem cell factor. This dimerizes the transmembrane receptor to another RTK receptor, which causes the autophosphorylation and subsequent conformational change of the homodimerized receptor. This conformational change activates the dormant kinase of each RTK on the tyrosine residue. Due to the fact that the receptor spans across the membrane from the extracellular environment, through the lipid bilayer, and into the cytoplasm, the binding of the receptor to the ligand also causes the trans phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor.

An adaptor protein (such as SOS) recognizes the phosphorylated tyrosine on the receptor. This protein functions as a bridge which connects the RTK to an intermediate protein (such as GNRP), starting the intracellular signaling cascade. In turn, the intermediate protein stimulates GDP-bound Ras to the activated GTP-bound Ras. GAP eventually returns Ras to its inactive state. Activation of Ras has the potential to initiate three signaling pathways downstream of Ras: Ras→Raf→MAP kinase pathway, PI3 kinase pathway, and Ral pathway. Each pathway leads to the activation of transcription factors which enter the nucleus to alter gene expression.

====RTK receptor and cancer====
Paracrine signaling of growth factors between nearby cells has been shown to exacerbate carcinogenesis. In fact, mutant forms of a single RTK may play a causal role in very different types of cancer. The Kit proto-oncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor whose ligand is a paracrine protein called stem cell factor (SCF), which is important in hematopoiesis (formation of cells in blood). The Kit receptor and related tyrosine kinase receptors actually are inhibitory and effectively suppresses receptor firing. Mutant forms of the Kit receptor, which fire constitutively in a ligand-independent fashion, are found in a diverse array of cancerous malignancies.

====RTK pathway and cancer====
Research on thyroid cancer has elucidated the theory that paracrine signaling may aid in creating tumor microenvironments. Chemokine transcription is upregulated when Ras is in the GTP-bound state. The chemokines are then released from the cell, free to bind to another nearby cell. Paracrine signaling between neighboring cells creates this positive feedback loop. Thus, the constitutive transcription of upregulated proteins form ideal environments for tumors to arise. Effectively, multiple bindings of ligands to the RTK receptors overstimulates the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, which overexpresses the mitogenic and invasive capacity of cells.

===JAK-STAT pathway===
In addition to RTK pathway, fibroblast growth factors can also activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Instead of carrying covalently associated tyrosine kinase domains, Jak-STAT receptors form noncovalent complexes with tyrosine kinases of the Jak (Janus kinase) class. These receptors bind are for erythropoietin (important for erythropoiesis), thrombopoietin (important for platelet formation), and interferon (important for mediating immune cell function).

After dimerization of the cytokine receptors following ligand binding, the JAKs transphosphorylate each other. The resulting phosphotyrosines attract STAT proteins. The STAT proteins dimerize and enter the nucleus to act as transcription factors to alter gene expression. In particular, the STATs transcribe genes that aid in cell proliferation and survival – such as myc.

Phenotype and survival of mice after knockout of some JAK or STAT genes: 
====Aberrant JAK-STAT pathway and bone mutations====
The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is instrumental in the development of limbs, specifically in its ability to regulate bone growth through paracrine signaling of cytokines. However, mutations in this pathway have been implicated in severe forms of dwarfism: thanatophoric dysplasia (lethal) and achondroplasic dwarfism (viable). This is due to a mutation in a Fgf gene, causing a premature and constitutive activation of the Stat1 transcription factor. Chondrocyte cell division is prematurely terminated, resulting in lethal dwarfism. Rib and limb bone growth plate cells are not transcribed. Thus, the inability of the rib cage to expand prevents the newborn&#x27;s breathing.

====JAK-STAT pathway and cancer====
Research on paracrine signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway revealed its potential in activating invasive behavior of ovarian epithelial cells. This epithelial to mesenchymal transition is highly evident in metastasis. Paracrine signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway is necessary in the transition from stationary epithelial cells to mobile mesenchymal cells, which are capable of invading surrounding tissue. Only the JAK-STAT pathway has been found to induce migratory cells.

== Hedgehog family ==
The Hedgehog protein family is involved in induction of cell types and the creation of tissue boundaries and patterning and are found in all bilateral organisms. Hedgehog proteins were first discovered and studied in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Hedgehog proteins produce key signals for the establishment of limb and body plan of fruit flies as well as homeostasis of adult tissues, involved in late embryogenesis and metamorphosis. At least three &quot;Drosophila&quot; hedgehog homologs have been found in vertebrates: sonic hedgehog, desert hedgehog, and Indian hedgehog. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) has various roles in vertebrae development, mediating signaling and regulating the organization of central nervous system, limb, and somite polarity. Desert hedgehog (DHH) is expressed in the Sertoli cells involved in spermatogenesis. Indian hedgehog (IHH) is expressed in the gut and cartilage, important in postnatal bone growth.

=== Hedgehog signaling pathway ===

Members of the Hedgehog protein family act by binding to a transmembrane &quot;Patched&quot; receptor, which is bound to the &quot;Smoothened&quot; protein, by which the Hedgehog signal can be transduced. In the absence of Hedgehog, the Patched receptor inhibits Smoothened action. Inhibition of Smoothened causes the Cubitus interruptus (Ci), Fused, and Cos protein complex attached to microtubules to remain intact. In this conformation, the Ci protein is cleaved so that a portion of the protein is allowed to enter the nucleus and act as a transcriptional repressor. In the presence of Hedgehog, Patched no longer inhibits Smoothened. Then active Smoothened protein is able to inhibit PKA and Slimb, so that the Ci protein is not cleaved. This intact Ci protein can enter the nucleus, associate with CPB protein and act as a transcriptional activator, inducing the expression of Hedgehog-response genes.

=== Hedgehog signaling pathway and cancer ===
The Hedgehog Signaling pathway is critical in proper tissue patterning and orientation during normal development of most animals. Hedgehog proteins induce cell proliferation in certain cells and differentiations in others. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog pathway has been implicated in several types of cancers, Basal Cell Carcinoma in particular. This uncontrolled activation of the Hedgehog proteins can be caused by mutations to the signal pathway, which would be ligand independent, or a mutation that causes overexpression of the Hedgehog protein, which would be ligand dependent. In addition, therapy-induced Hedgehog pathway activation has been shown to be necessary for progression of Prostate Cancer tumors after androgen deprivation therapy. This connection between the Hedgehog signaling pathway and human cancers may provide for the possible of therapeutic intervention as treatment for such cancers. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is also involved in normal regulation of stem-cell populations, and required for normal growth and regeneration of damaged organs. This may provide another possible route for tumorigenesis via the Hedgehog pathway.

== Wnt family ==
The Wnt protein family includes a large number of cysteine-rich glycoproteins. The Wnt proteins activate signal transduction cascades via three different pathways, the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, and the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. Wnt proteins appear to control a wide range of developmental processes and have been seen as necessary for control of spindle orientation, cell polarity, cadherin mediated adhesion, and early development of embryos in many different organisms. Current research has indicated that deregulation of Wnt signaling plays a role in tumor formation, because at a cellular level, Wnt proteins often regulated cell proliferation, cell morphology, cell motility, and cell fate.

=== The canonical Wnt signaling pathway ===
In the canonical pathway, Wnt proteins binds to its transmembrane receptor of the Frizzled family of proteins. The binding of Wnt to a Frizzled protein activates the Dishevelled protein. In its active state the Dishevelled protein inhibits the activity of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) enzyme. Normally active GSK3 prevents the dissociation of β-catenin to the APC protein, which results in β-catenin degradation. Thus inhibited GSK3, allows β-catenin to dissociate from APC, accumulate, and travel to nucleus. In the nucleus β-catenin associates with Lef/Tcf transcription factor, which is already working on DNA as a repressor, inhibiting the transcription of the genes it binds. Binding of β-catenin to Lef/Tcf works as a transcription activator, activating the transcription of the Wnt-responsive genes.

=== The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways ===
The noncanonical Wnt pathways provide a signal transduction pathway for Wnt that does not involve β-catenin. In the noncanonical pathways, Wnt affects the actin and microtubular cytoskeleton as well as gene transcription.

==== The noncanonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway ====
The noncanonical PCP pathway regulates cell morphology, division, and movement. Once again Wnt proteins binds to and activates Frizzled so that Frizzled activates a Dishevelled protein that is tethered to the plasma membrane through a Prickle protein and transmembrane Stbm protein. The active Dishevelled activates RhoA GTPase through Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam1) and the Rac protein. Active RhoA is able to induce cytoskeleton changes by activating Roh-associated kinase (ROCK) and affect gene transcription directly. Active Rac can directly induce cytoskeleton changes and affect gene transcription through activation of JNK.

==== The noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway====
The noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway regulates intracellular calcium levels. Again Wnt binds and activates to Frizzled. In this case however activated Frizzled causes a coupled G-protein to activate a phospholipase (PLC), which interacts with and splits PIP2 into DAG and IP3. IP3 can then bind to a receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum to release intracellular calcium stores, to induce calcium-dependent gene expression.

=== Wnt signaling pathways and cancer ===
The Wnt signaling pathways are critical in cell-cell signaling during normal development and embryogenesis and required for maintenance of adult tissue, therefore it is not difficult to understand why disruption in Wnt signaling pathways can promote human degenerative disease and cancer.

The Wnt signaling pathways are complex, involving many different elements, and therefore have many targets for misregulation. Mutations that cause constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway lead to tumor formation and cancer. Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway can lead to increase cell proliferation. Current research is focused on the action of the Wnt signaling pathway the regulation of stem cell choice to proliferate and self renew. This action of Wnt signaling in the possible control and maintenance of stem cells, may provide a possible treatment in cancers exhibiting aberrant Wnt signaling.

== TGF-β superfamily ==
&quot;TGF&quot; (Transforming Growth Factor) is a family of proteins that includes 33 members that encode dimeric, secreted polypeptides that regulate development. Many developmental processes are under its control including gastrulation, axis symmetry of the body, organ morphogenesis, and tissue homeostasis in adults. All TGF-β ligands bind to either Type I or Type II receptors, to create heterotetramic complexes.

=== TGF-β pathway ===
The TGF-β pathway regulates many cellular processes in developing embryo and adult organisms, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and homeostasis. There are five kinds of type II receptors and seven types of type I receptors in humans and other mammals. These receptors are known as &quot;dual-specificity kinases&quot; because their cytoplasmic kinase domain has weak tyrosine kinase activity but strong serine/threonine kinase activity. When a TGF-β superfamily ligand binds to the type II receptor, it recruits a type I receptor and activates it by phosphorylating the serine or threonine residues of its &quot;GS&quot; box. This forms an activation complex that can then phosphorylate SMAD proteins.

=== SMAD pathway ===
There are three classes of SMADs:
# Receptor-regulated SMAD (R-SMAD)
# Common-mediator SMAD (Co-SMAD)
# Inhibitory SMAD (I-SMAD)

Examples of SMADs in each class:
The TGF-β superfamily activates members of the SMAD family, which function as transcription factors. Specifically, the type I receptor, activated by the type II receptor, phosphorylates R-SMADs that then bind to the co-SMAD, SMAD4. The R-SMAD/Co-SMAD forms a complex with importin and enters the nucleus, where they act as transcription factors and either up-regulate or down-regulate in the expression of a target gene.

Specific TGF-β ligands will result in the activation of either the SMAD2/3 or the SMAD1/5 R-SMADs. For instance, when activin, Nodal, or TGF-β ligand binds to the receptors, the phosphorylated receptor complex can activate SMAD2 and SMAD3 through phosphorylation. However, when a BMP ligand binds to the receptors, the phosphorylated receptor complex activates SMAD1 and SMAD5. Then, the Smad2/3 or the Smad1/5 complexes form a dimer complex with SMAD4 and become transcription factors. Though there are many R-SMADs involved in the pathway, there is only one co-SMAD, SMAD4.

=== Non-SMAD pathway ===
Non-Smad signaling proteins contribute to the responses of the TGF-β pathway in three ways. First, non-Smad signaling pathways phosphorylate the Smads. Second, Smads directly signal to other pathways by communicating directly with other signaling proteins, such as kinases. Finally, the TGF-β receptors directly phosphorylate non-Smad proteins.

=== Members of TGF-β superfamily ===

====1. TGF-β family ====
This family includes TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, and TGF-β5. They are involved in positively and negatively regulation of cell division, the formation of the extracellular matrix between cells, apoptosis, and embryogenesis. They bind to TGF-β type II receptor (TGFBRII).

TGF-β1 stimulates the synthesis of collagen and fibronectin and inhibits the degradation of the extracellular matrix. Ultimately, it increases the production of extracellular matrix by epithelial cells.
TGF-β proteins regulate epithelia by controlling where and when they branch to form kidney, lung, and salivary gland ducts.

==== 2. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMPs) family ====
Members of the BMP family were originally found to induce bone formation, as their name suggests. However, BMPs are very multifunctional and can also regulate apoptosis, cell migration, cell division, and differentiation. They also specify the anterior/posterior axis, induce growth, and regulate homeostasis.

The BMPs bind to the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2). Some of the proteins of the BMP family are BMP4 and BMP7. BMP4 promotes bone formation, causes cell death, or signals the formation of epidermis, depending on the tissue it is acting on. BMP7 is crucial for kidney development, sperm synthesis, and neural tube polarization. Both BMP4 and BMP7 regulate mature ligand stability and processing, including degrading ligands in lysosomes. BMPs act by diffusing from the cells that create them.

===Summary table of TGF-β signaling pathway===
==Examples==
Growth factor and clotting factors are paracrine signaling agents. The local action of growth factor signaling plays an especially important role in the development of tissues. Also, retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A, functions in a paracrine fashion to regulate gene expression during embryonic development in higher animals. 
In insects, Allatostatin controls growth through paracrine action on the corpora allata.
In mature organisms, paracrine signaling is involved in responses to allergens, tissue repair, the formation of scar tissue, and blood clotting. Histamine is a paracrine that is released by immune cells in the bronchial tree. Histamine causes the smooth muscle cells of the bronchi to constrict, narrowing the airways.
