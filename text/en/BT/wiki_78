<text>English art is the body of visual arts made in England. England has Europe&#x27;s earliest and northernmost ice-age cave art. Prehistoric art in England largely corresponds with art made elsewhere in contemporary Britain, but early medieval Anglo-Saxon art saw the development of a distinctly English style, and English art continued thereafter to have a distinct character. English art made after the formation in 1707 of the Kingdom of Great Britain may be regarded in most respects simultaneously as art of the United Kingdom.

Medieval English painting, mainly religious, had a strong national tradition and was influential in Europe. The English Reformation, which was antipathetic to art, not only brought this tradition to an abrupt stop but resulted in the destruction of almost all wall-paintings. Only illuminated manuscripts now survive in good numbers.

There is in the art of the English Renaissance a strong interest in portraiture, and the portrait miniature was more popular in England than anywhere else. English Renaissance sculpture was mainly architectural and for monumental tombs. Interest in English landscape painting had begun to develop by the time of the 1707 Act of Union.

Substantive definitions of English art have been attempted by, among others, art scholar Nikolaus Pevsner (in his 1956 book &quot;The Englishness of English Art&quot;), art historian Roy Strong (in his 2000 book &quot;The Spirit of Britain: A narrative history of the arts&quot;) and critic Peter Ackroyd (in his 2002 book &quot;Albion&quot;).

==Earliest art==
The earliest English art – also Europe&#x27;s earliest and northernmost cave art – is located at Creswell Crags in Derbyshire, estimated at between 13,000 and 15,000 years old. In 2003, more than 80 engravings and bas-reliefs, depicting deer, bison, horses, and what may be birds or bird-headed people were found there. The famous, large ritual landscape of Stonehenge dates from the Neolithic period; around 2600 BC. From around 2150 BC, the Beaker people learned how to make bronze, and used both tin and gold. They became skilled in metal refining and their works of art, placed in graves or sacrificial pits have survived. In the Iron Age, a new art style arrived as Celtic culture and spread across the British isles. Though metalwork, especially gold ornaments, was still important, stone and most likely wood were also used. This style continued into the Roman period, beginning in the 1st century BC, and found a renaissance in the Medieval period. The arrival of the Romans brought the Classical style of which many monuments have survived, especially funerary monuments, statues and busts. They also brought glasswork and mosaics. In the 4th century, a new element was introduced as the first Christian art was made in Britain. Several mosaics with Christian symbols and pictures have been preserved. England boasts some remarkable prehistoric hill figures; a famous example is the Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire, which &quot;for more than 3,000 years ... has been jealously guarded as a masterpiece of minimalist art.&quot;

==Medieval art==
After Roman rule, Anglo-Saxon art brought the incorporation of Germanic traditions, as may be seen in the metalwork of Sutton Hoo. Anglo-Saxon sculpture was outstanding for its time, at least in the small works in ivory or bone which are almost all that survive. Especially in Northumbria, the Insular art style shared across the British Isles produced the finest work being produced in Europe, until the Viking raids and invasions largely suppressed the movement; the Book of Lindisfarne is one example certainly produced in Northumbria. Anglo-Saxon art developed a very sophisticated variation on contemporary Continental styles, seen especially in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts such as the Benedictional of St. Æthelwold. None of the large-scale Anglo-Saxon paintings and sculptures that we know existed have survived.

By the first half of the 11th century, English art benefited from lavish patronage by a wealthy Anglo-Saxon elite, who valued above all works in precious metals. but the Norman Conquest in 1066 brought a sudden halt to this art boom, and instead works were melted down or removed to Normandy. The so-called Bayeux Tapestry - the large, English-made, embroidered cloth depicting events leading up to the Norman conquest - dates to the late 11th century. Some decades after the Norman conquest, manuscript painting in England was soon again among the best of any in Europe; in Romanesque works such as the Winchester Bible and the St. Albans Psalter, and then in early Gothic ones like the Tickhill Psalter. The best-known English illuminator of the period is Matthew Paris (–1259). Some of the rare surviving examples of English medieval panel paintings, such as the Westminster Retable and Wilton Diptych, are of the highest quality. From the late 14th century to the early 16th century, England had a considerable industry in Nottingham alabaster reliefs for mid-market altarpieces and small statues, which were exported across Northern Europe. Another art form introduced through the church was stained glass, which was also adopted for secular uses.

==16th and 17th centuries==
Nicholas Hilliard (–7 January 1619) – &quot;the first native-born genius of English painting&quot; – began a strong English tradition in the portrait miniature. The tradition was continued by Hilliard&#x27;s pupil Isaac Oliver (–bur. 2 October 1617), whose French Huguenot parents had escaped to England in the artist&#x27;s childhood.

Other notable English artists across the period include: Nathaniel Bacon (1585–1627); John Bettes the Elder (active –1570) and John Bettes the Younger (died 1616); George Gower (–1596), William Larkin (early 1580s–1619), and Robert Peake the Elder (–1619). The artists of the Tudor court and their successors until the early 18th century included a number of influential imported talents: Hans Holbein the Younger, Anthony van Dyck, Peter Paul Rubens, Orazio Gentileschi and his daughter Artemisia, Sir Peter Lely (a naturalised English subject from 1662), and Sir Godfrey Kneller (a naturalised English subject by the time of his 1691 knighthood).

The 17th century saw a number of significant English painters of full-size portraits, most notably William Dobson 1611 (bapt. 1611–bur. 1646); others include Cornelius Johnson (bapt. 1593–bur. 1661) and Robert Walker (1599–1658). Samuel Cooper (1609–1672) was an accomplished miniaturist in Hilliard&#x27;s tradition, as was his brother Alexander Cooper (1609–1660), and their uncle, John Hoskins (1589/1590–1664). Other notable portraitists of the period include: Thomas Flatman (1635–1688), Richard Gibson (1615–1690), the dissolute John Greenhill (c. 1644–1676), John Riley (1646–1691), and John Michael Wright (1617–1694). Francis Barlow (c. 1626–1704) is known as &quot;the father of British sporting painting&quot;; he was England&#x27;s first wildlife painter, beginning a tradition that reached a high-point a century later, in the work of George Stubbs (1724–1806). English women began painting professionally in the 17th century; notable examples include Joan Carlile (c. 1606–79), and Mary Beale (née Cradock; 1633–1699).

In the first half of the 17th century the English nobility became important collectors of European art, led by King Charles I and Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel. By the end of the 17th century, the Grand Tour – a trip of Europe giving exposure to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance – was &quot;de rigueur&quot; for wealthy young Englishmen.

==18th and 19th centuries==

In the 18th century, English painting&#x27;s distinct style and tradition continued to concentrate frequently on portraiture, but interest in landscapes increased, and a new focus was placed on history painting, which was regarded as the highest of the hierarchy of genres, and is exemplified in the extraordinary work of Sir James Thornhill (1675/1676–1734). History painter Robert Streater (1621–1679) was highly thought of in his time.

William Hogarth (1697–1764) reflected the burgeoning English middle-class temperament — English in habits, disposition, and temperament, as well as by birth. His satirical works, full of black humour, point out to contemporary society the deformities, weaknesses and vices of London life. Hogarth&#x27;s influence can be found in the distinctively English satirical tradition continued by James Gillray (1756–1815), and George Cruikshank (1792–1878). One of the genres in which Hogarth worked was the conversation piece, a form in which certain of his contemporaries also excelled: Joseph Highmore (1692–1780), Francis Hayman (1708–1776), and Arthur Devis (1712–1787).

Portraits were in England, as in Europe, the easiest and most profitable way for an artist to make a living, and the English tradition continued to show the relaxed elegance of the portrait-style traceable to Van Dyck. The leading portraitists are: Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788); Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), founder of the Royal Academy of Arts; George Romney (1734–1802); Lemuel &quot;Francis&quot; Abbott (1760/61–1802); Richard Westall (1765–1836); Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769–1830); and Thomas Phillips (1770–1845). Also of note are Jonathan Richardson (1667–1745) and his pupil (and defiant son-in-law) Thomas Hudson (1701–1779). Joseph Wright of Derby (1734–1797) was well known for his candlelight pictures; George Stubbs (1724–1806) and, later, Edwin Henry Landseer (1802–1873) for their animal paintings. By the end of the century, the English swagger portrait was much admired abroad.

London&#x27;s William Blake (1757–1827) produced a diverse and visionary body of work defying straightforward classification; critic Jonathan Jones regards him as &quot;far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced&quot;. Blake&#x27;s artist friends included neoclassicist John Flaxman (1755–1826), and Thomas Stothard (1755–1834) with whom Blake quarrelled.

In the popular imagination English landscape painting from the 18th century onwards typifies English art, inspired largely from the love of the pastoral and mirroring as it does the development of larger country houses set in a pastoral rural landscape. Two English Romantics are largely responsible for raising the status of landscape painting worldwide: John Constable (1776–1837) and J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851), who is credited with elevating landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting. Other notable 18th and 19th century landscape painters include: George Arnald (1763–1841); John Linnell (1792–1882), a rival to Constable in his time; George Morland (1763–1804), who developed on Francis Barlow&#x27;s tradition of animal and rustic painting; Samuel Palmer (1805–1881); Paul Sandby (1731–1809), who is recognised as the father of English watercolour painting; and subsequent watercolourists John Robert Cozens (1752–1797), Turner&#x27;s friend Thomas Girtin (1775–1802), and Thomas Heaphy (1775–1835).

The early 19th century saw the emergence of the Norwich school of painters, the first provincial art movement outside of London. Short-lived owing to sparse patronage and internal dissent, its prominent members were &quot;founding father&quot; John Crome (1768–1821), John Sell Cotman (1782–1842), James Stark (1794–1859), and Joseph Stannard (1797–1830).

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood movement, established in the 1840s, dominated English art in the second half of the 19th century. Its members — William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882), John Everett Millais (1828–1896) and others — concentrated on religious, literary, and genre works executed in a colorful and minutely detailed, almost photographic style. Ford Madox Brown (1821–1893) shared the Pre-Raphaelites&#x27; principles.

Leading English art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900) was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century; from the 1850s he championed the Pre-Raphaelites, who were influenced by his ideas. William Morris (1834–1896), founder of the Arts and Crafts Movement, emphasised the value of traditional craft skills which seemed to be in decline in the mass industrial age. His designs, like the work of the Pre-Raphaelite painters with whom he was associated, referred frequently to medieval motifs. English narrative painter William Powell Frith (1819–1909) has been described as the &quot;greatest British painter of the social scene since Hogarth&quot;, and painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts (1817–1904) became famous for his symbolist work.

The gallant spirit of 19th century English military art helped shape Victorian England&#x27;s self-image. Notable English military artists include: John Edward Chapman &#x27;Chester&#x27; Mathews (1843–1927); Lady Butler (1846–1933); Frank Dadd (1851–1929); Edward Matthew Hale (1852–1924); Charles Edwin Fripp (1854–1906); Richard Caton Woodville, Jr. (1856–1927); Harry Payne (1858–1927); George Delville Rowlandson (1861–1930); and Edgar Alfred Holloway (1870–1941). Thomas Davidson (1842–1919), who specialised in historical naval scenes, incorporated remarkable reproductions of Nelson-related works by Arnald, Westall and Abbott in &quot;England&#x27;s Pride and Glory&quot; (1894).

To the end of the 19th century, the art of Aubrey Beardsley (1872–1898) contributed to the development of Art Nouveau, and suggested, among other things, an interest in the visual art of Japan.

==20th century==

Impressionism found a focus in the New English Art Club, founded in 1886. Notable members included Walter Sickert (1860–1942) and Philip Wilson Steer (1860–1942), two English painters with coterminous lives who became influential in the 20th century. Sickert went on to the post-impressionist Camden Town Group, active 1911–1913, and was prominent in the transition to Modernism. Steer&#x27;s sea and landscape paintings made him a leading Impressionist, but later work displays a more traditional English style, influenced by both Constable and Turner.

Paul Nash (1889–1946) played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art. He was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century, and the artworks he produced during World War I are among the most iconic images of the conflict. Nash attended the Slade School of Art, where the remarkable generation of artists who studied under the influential Henry Tonks (1862–1937) included, too, Harold Gilman (1876–1919), Spencer Gore (1878–1914), David Bomberg (1890–1957), Stanley Spencer (1891–1959), Mark Gertler (1891–1939), and Roger Hilton (1911–1975).

Modernism&#x27;s most controversial English talent was writer and painter Wyndham Lewis (1882–1957). He co-founded the Vorticist movement in art, and after becoming better known for his writing than his painting in the 1920s and early 1930s he returned to more concentrated work on visual art, with paintings from the 1930s and 1940s constituting some of his best-known work. Walter Sickert called Wyndham Lewis: &quot;the greatest portraitist of this or any other time&quot;. Modernist sculpture was exemplified by English artists Henry Moore (1898–1986), well known for his carved marble and larger-scale abstract cast bronze sculptures, and Barbara Hepworth (1903–1975), who was a leading figure in the colony of artists who resided in St Ives, Cornwall during World War II.

Lancastrian L. S. Lowry (1887–1976) became famous for his scenes of life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century. He developed a distinctive style of painting and is best known for his urban landscapes peopled with human figures often referred to as &quot;matchstick men&quot;.

Notable English artists of the mid-20th century and after include: Graham Sutherland (1903–1980); Carel Weight (1908–1997); Ruskin Spear (1911–1990); pop art pioneers Richard Hamilton (1922–2011), Peter Blake (b. 1932), and David Hockney (b. 1937); and op art exemplar Bridget Riley (b. 1931).

Following the development of Postmodernism, English art became in some respect synonymous toward the end of the 20th century with the Turner Prize; the prize, established in 1984 and named with ostensibly credible intentions after J. M. W. Turner, earned for latterday English art a reputation arguably to its detriment. Prize exhibits have included a shark in formaldehyde and a dishevelled bed.

While the Turner Prize establishment satisfied itself with weak conceptual homages to authentic iconoclasts like Duchamp and Manzoni, it spurned original talents such as Beryl Cook (1926–2008). The award ceremony has since 2000 attracted annual demonstrations by the &quot;Stuckists&quot;, a group calling for a return to figurative art and aesthetic authenticity. Observing wryly that &quot;the only artist who wouldn&#x27;t be in danger of winning the Turner Prize is Turner&quot;, the Stuckists staged in 2000 a &quot;Real Turner Prize 2000&quot; exhibition, promising (by contrast) &quot;no rubbish&quot;.

The sculptor Antony Gormley (b. 1950) expressed doubts a decade after winning the Turner Prize about his &quot;usefulness to the human race&quot;, and work including &quot;Another Place&quot; (2005) and &quot;Event Horizon&quot; (2012) has achieved both acclaim and popularity. The pseudo-subversive urban art of Banksy, has been much discussed in the media.

A highly visible and much praised work of public art, seen for a brief period in 2014 was &quot;Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red&quot;, a collaboration between artist Paul Cummins (b. 1977) and theatre designer Tom Piper. The installation at the Tower of London between July and November 2014 commemorated the centenary of the outbreak of World War I; it consisted of 888,246 ceramic red poppies, each intended to represent one British or Colonial serviceman killed in the War.

Leading contemporary printmakers include Norman Ackroyd and Richard Spare.

<text>Christopher George Hewett (5 April 1921 – 3 August 2001) was an English actor and theatre director best known for his role as Lynn Aloysius Belvedere on the ABC sitcom &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;.

==Career==
Hewett was born in Worthing, Sussex to Christopher Fitzsimon Hewett (an army officer and a descendant of Daniel O&#x27;Connell), and his wife Eleanor Joyce Watts (an actress whose professional name was Rhoda Cleighton). He was educated at Beaumont College and at Wimbledon College, and at aged 7, made his acting debut in a Dublin stage production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. At age 16 Hewett joined the Royal Air Force, leaving in 1940. Hewett then joined the Oxford Repertory Company and made his West End theatre debut in 1943.

He later appeared on Broadway in the musicals &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;First Impressions&quot;, &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, &quot;Music Is&quot; and &quot;Kean&quot; and in the plays &quot;Sleuth&quot; and &quot;The Affair&quot;, among others, and directed the 1960 Broadway revue &quot;From A to Z&quot; and the 1967 Off Broadway revival of the Rodgers and Hart musical &quot;By Jupiter&quot;. Hewett also directed several stage productions including &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Fringe and Camelot&quot;.

Hewett made his film debut in the crime drama &quot;Pool of London&quot; (1951), and later appeared in roles on &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; and &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot;. He appeared as the grandiose and camp theatre director Roger DeBris in Mel Brooks&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Producers&quot; (1967). In 1976, Hewett played the generic bureaucrat Federov in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;. During the 1979-80 season he played Captain Hook to Sandy Duncan&#x27;s Peter Pan on Broadway. From 1983 to 1984 he portrayed Lawrence, Mr. Roarke&#x27;s (Ricardo Montalbán) sidekick on the final season of the ABC series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.

The following year, Hewett landed his best-known role as Lynn Aloysius Belvedere, an English butler who works for a middle class American family in the sitcom &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;. After the series ended its run in 1990 Hewett appeared in a guest spot on an episode of the NBC teen sitcom &quot;California Dreams&quot; in 1994. His last on-screen role was a cameo appearance on the Fox series &quot;Ned and Stacey&quot; in 1997.

==Personal life and death==
A devout Catholic and lifelong bachelor, Hewett served at St. Victor&#x27;s Church in West Hollywood. During his later years, he suffered from arthritis and diabetes.

Hewett died on 3 August 2001, in his Los Angeles home from complications of diabetes at age 80.

<doc id="579599" wikidata="Q443225" url="?curid=579599" title="Gene Austin">
<text>Lemeul Eugene Lucas (June 24, 1900 – January 24, 1972), better known by his stage name Gene Austin, was an American singer and songwriter, one of the early &quot;crooners&quot;. His recording of &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; sold over 5 million copies and was for a while the largest selling record of all time. His 1920s compositions &quot;When My Sugar Walks Down the Street&quot; and &quot;The Lonesome Road&quot; became pop and jazz standards.

==Early life==
Austin was born as Lemeul Eugene Lucas in Gainesville, Texas (north of Dallas), to Nova Lucas and the former Serena Belle Harrell. He took the name Gene Austin from his stepfather Jim Austin, a blacksmith. Austin grew up in Minden, Louisiana. In Minden, he learned to play piano and guitar. He ran away from home at 15. He attended a vaudeville act in Houston, Texas, where the audience was allowed to come to the stage and sing. On a dare from his friends, Austin took the stage and sang for the first time since singing as a Southern Baptist choir boy. The audience response was overwhelming, and the vaudeville company immediately offered him a billed spot on its ticket.

Austin joined the U.S. Army at the age of 15 in hopes of being dispatched to Europe to fight in World War I. He was stationed in New Orleans, where he played the piano at night in the city&#x27;s notorious vice district. His familiarity with horses from helping his stepfather in his blacksmithing business prompted the Army to assign Austin to the cavalry and send him to Mexico with Major General John J. Pershing&#x27;s Pancho Villa Expedition, for which he was awarded the Mexican Service Medal. He later served in France in World War I.

On returning to the United States in 1919, Austin settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where he briefly studied dentistry and law. Soon, he was playing piano and singing in local taverns. He started writing songs and formed a vaudeville act with Roy Bergere, with whom he wrote &quot;How Come You Do Me Like You Do&quot;. The act ended when Bergere married. Austin worked briefly in a club owned by Lou Clayton, who later was a part of the famous vaudeville team Clayton, Jackson and Durante.

==Career==

Gene Austin was an influential early crooner whose records in their day enjoyed record sales and the highest circulation. He made a substantial number of influential recordings, including a string of best-sellers. Some of his best sellers include &quot;The Lonesome Road&quot;, &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;, &quot;Riding Around in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Tonight You Belong to Me&quot;, and &quot;Ramona&quot;. At the peak of his career, Austin demanded that only the pianist Fats Waller could provide accompaniment on his records.

By 1924, Austin was in New York&#x27;s Tin Pan Alley. His first recording surreptitiously was providing the vocals for the Tennessee guitarist George Reneau, whose own voice did not record well.

In 1925, Austin recorded his popular song &quot;When My Sugar Walks Down the Street&quot; for the Victor Talking Machine Company in a duet with Aileen Stanley. Nathaniel Shilkret, in his autobiography, describes the events leading to the recording. He followed it that year with hits, including &quot;Yearning (Just for You)&quot; and &quot;Yes Sir, That&#x27;s My Baby with Billy &quot;Uke&quot; Carpenter. In the next decade with Victor, Austin sold over 80 million records.

His 1926 &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; was in the year&#x27;s top 20 records. George A. Whiting and Walter Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; was charted during 1928 for 26 weeks, stayed at No. 1 for 13, and sold over 5 million copies. It was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Until Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; replaced it, it was the largest selling record of all time. In the hope of duplicating the success, this was quickly followed by &quot;Ramona&quot;, an L. Wolfe Gilbert-Mabel Wayne song created for the 1927 romantic adventure film &quot;Ramona&quot; with Dolores del Río. It charted for 17 weeks, was No. 1 for eight and easily topped 1 million in sales. It also gained gold disc status. His next success, Joe Burke and Benny Davis&#x27; 1928 song &quot;Carolina Moon&quot; was on the charts 14 weeks, with seven weeks at No. 1. The depression struck during Austin&#x27;s hit-making years, severely damaged the recording industry and, with it, Austin&#x27;s recording career.

Despite never learning to read or notate music, Austin composed over 100 songs. His compositions included &quot;When My Sugar Walks Down the Street&quot;, recorded by Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, The Ink Spots, Hot Lips Page, Johnny Mathis, The Four Freshmen, Red Nichols&#x27; Five Pennies, Ella Fitzgerald, Sy Oliver, and the Wolverines Orchestra; &quot;How Come You Do Me Like You Do?&quot;, recorded by Fletcher Henderson and His Orchestra, Gene Rodemich, Marion Harris, George Wettling, and Erroll Garner; &quot;The Lonesome Road&quot;, written with Nat Shilkret, recorded by Bing Crosby, Fats Waller, Louis Armstrong, Eddy Arnold, Don Gibson, Mildred Bailey, Les Paul, Judy Garland, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Sammy Davis Jr., Dick Dale, The Fendermen, Frank Sinatra, Chet Atkins, Bobby Darin, Duane Eddy, Paul Robeson, Jerry Vale, Muggsy Spanier, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Jimmie Lunceford, Frankie Laine and Ted Lewis; &quot;Riding Around in the Rain&quot;, written with Carmen Lombardo and &quot;The Voice of the Southland&quot;.

Austin formed a trio with bassist Johnny Candido and guitarist Otto Heimel. They called themselves Gene Austin and his Candy and Coco. They had a radio series from 1932 to 1934.

Colonel Tom Parker, who later became Elvis Presley&#x27;s manager, gradually worked his way into the music business when he began to promote Gene Austin in 1938.

In the 1940s, Austin and his singers toured the U.S. in a 14-truck caravan with its own power plant and cook house. He stopped in Minden, Louisiana, and performed there in a popular tent show on the grounds of the local Coca-Cola plant owned by the Hunter family.

===Film appearances===
Offered to work in Hollywood at the height of his career as the &quot;Voice of the Southland&quot;, Austin appeared in several films, including &quot;Belle of the Nineties&quot;, &quot;Klondike Annie&quot;, &quot;Sadie McKee&quot; – all 1934 releases, &quot;Songs and Saddles&quot; (1938), and &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot; (1940) at the request of his friend Mae West.

== Musical style ==
With the advent of electrical recording, Austin, along with Rudy Vallee, Art Gillham, Nick Lucas, Johnny Marvin and Cliff Edwards, adopted an intimate, radio-friendly, close-miked style that took over from the full-voiced, stage-friendly style of tenor vocals popularized by such singers as Henry Burr and Billy Murray. Such later crooners as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Russ Columbo all credited Austin with creating the musical genre that began their careers. Austin also influenced his friend Jimmie Rodgers (who considered Austin his &quot;idol&quot;) and as such contributed to the birth of country music.

==Honors==
In 1978, Austin&#x27;s 1928 Victor recording of &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; (Victor 20964A), was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2005, his 1926 Victor recording of &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; (Victor 20044) was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame as well.

==Personal life==
Austin married his first wife, Kathryn Arnold, a dancer, in 1924 and divorced her in 1929. They had a child, Ann, born in 1928. Austin married his second wife, Agnes Antelline, in 1933, and their daughter Charlotte was born that same year. He and Agnes divorced in 1940. Austin then married actress Doris Sherrell in 1940, and divorced her in 1946. He married wife number four, LouCeil Hudson, a singer, in 1949, and the marriage lasted until 1966. Austin married Gigi Theodorea in 1967, his fifth and final marriage.

Country music singer Tommy Overstreet, who had his biggest hits in the 1970s, is Austin&#x27;s third cousin.

Austin retired to Palm Springs, California in the late 1950s and was active in civic boards there until 1970. Income from his record sales allowed him to live comfortably the rest of his life.

In 1962, he campaigned unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Nevada.

He died in Palm Springs of lung cancer and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>Bleaker Island () is one of the Falkland Islands, lying off south east Lafonia (the southern peninsula of East Falkland). The name is a corruption of &quot;Breaker Island&quot; due to the waves that break on it. It was also known as &quot;Long Island&quot; at one point.

==Geography==
Bleaker Island is long, narrow and low-lying and the southern tip of the Island is separated from Lafonia by a thin stretch of water named &#x27;The Jump&#x27;. It has an area of and is long. The island is no wider than at any point and tapers to several thin necks of land at various points down its length. The highest point is Semaphore Hill, at . The western shores of Bleaker Island are low-lying and fringed by shallow stone beaches. The east coast of the island is characterised by low cliffs, interspersed with sand and pebble beaches and gulches and is directly exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. The island has several large ponds and the most impressive beach is the &#x27;Sandy Bay&#x27;.

==History==
Bleaker Island has been a sheep farm for over a hundred years. The island was managed by Arthur Cobb, a locally well-known agriculturalist and amateur naturalist, in the early 20th century who wrote a book on the subject, containing forty six of his own black and white photographs.

The low aspect of the Island resulted in many ship-wrecks off the Island in the 19th and 20th centuries. There were five ship-wrecks on Bleaker Island in the first quarter of the 20th century. The most famous of these was the French tall ship &#x27;Cassard&#x27; wrecked on the southern tip of the Island carrying a cargo of coal in May 1906.

The Island has been run as an organic sheep and cattle farm by Mike and Phyll Rendell since 1999, and has the small Bleaker Island Settlement located on an isthmus in the centre of its length. They built a self-catering cottage, &quot;Cobb&#x27;s Cottage&quot;, and a house there in 2000 called &quot;The Outlook&quot;, and in 2011 they added a new house, called &quot;Cassard House&quot;. They employ a farming couple who live there.

==Wildlife==
The northern half of Bleaker Island is a National Nature Reserve – being designated in 1967. A total of 79 species of flowering plant have been identified on Bleaker Island. Flora includes the yellow and dog orchid, and lady&#x27;s slipper. A stretch of several kilometres of the east coast is vegetated by stands of tussac grass. The island is home to a wide variety of wildlife including southern sea lions with some visiting southern elephant seals.

Norway rats were accidentally introduced to the island in the 1980s. They have now spread throughout the island and onto First, Second and Third Islands. Overgrazing was a problem but reduced grazing pressure is helping the slow regeneration of tussac and native flowering plants.

===Birds===
The Bleaker Island group has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. A survey identified 49 bird species on the islands, 37 of which were confirmed as breeding there. Breeding species include rockhopper, Magellanic and gentoo penguins, king and rock cormorants, many small bird species and several birds of prey, including striated and crested caracaras.

<doc id="579604" wikidata="Q191851" url="?curid=579604" title="Vase">
<text>A vase ( or ) is an open container. It can be made from a number of materials, such as ceramics, glass, non-rusting metals, such as aluminium, brass, bronze, or stainless steel. Even wood has been used to make vases, either by using tree species that naturally resist rot, such as teak, or by applying a protective coating to conventional wood or plastic. Vases are often decorated, and they are often used to hold cut flowers. Vases come in different sizes to support whatever flower is being held or kept in place.

Vases generally share a similar shape. The foot or the base may be bulbous, flat, carinate, or another shape. The body forms the main portion of the piece. Some vases have a shoulder, where the body curves inward, a neck, which gives height, and a lip, where the vase flares back out at the top. Some vases are also given handles.

Various styles and types of vases have been developed around the world in different time periods, such as Chinese ceramics and Native American pottery. In the pottery of ancient Greece &quot;vase-painting&quot; is the traditional term covering the famous fine painted pottery, often with many figures in scenes from Greek mythology. Such pieces may be referred to as vases regardless of their shape; most were in fact used for holding or serving liquids, and many would more naturally be called cups, jugs and so on. In 2003, Grayson Perry won the Turner Prize for his ceramics, typically in vase form.

== History ==
There is a long history of the form and function of the vase in nearly all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are the only artistic evidence left from vanished cultures. In the beginning stages of pottery, the coiling method of building was the most utilized technique to make pottery. The coiling method is the act of working the clay into long cylindrical strips that later become smooth walls.

== Potter&#x27;s wheel ==
The potter&#x27;s wheel was probably invented in Mesopotamia by the 4th millennium BCE, but spread across nearly all Eurasia and much of Africa, though it remained unknown in the New World until the arrival of Europeans. The earliest discovery of the origins of the potter&#x27;s wheel was in southern Iraq. The discovery of this technique was beneficial to the people of south Iraq because it served as a substitute for their previous inefficient traditions. Upon this new technique, it would then grow gradually and even be adopted for the use of decorating pottery.

== Garden vase ==
Garden vases are usually V-shaped but they can also be cylindrical or bowl-shaped. They are usually made of ceramic or, today, plastic. Examples are the Torlonia Vase and the Medici Vase in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.

Guy Williams was born of Sicilian parentage on January 14, 1924, as Armando Joseph Catalano in the Washington Heights area of New York City. His parents, insurance broker Attilio Catalano and Clara (Arcara) Catalano, were from Lercara Friddi, and were by then living in poverty. Attilio was the son of a wealthy timber grower in Messina, who purchased land in New Jersey. Williams grew up in the Little Italy neighborhood of The Bronx.

In Public School 189, Williams stood out in mathematics. Later, he attended George Washington High School, while he occasionally worked at a soda fountain. He then left to attend the Peekskill Military Academy, where he was an enthusiastic student. His interests included American football and chess.

===First artistic steps===
Williams wanted to be an actor, spurred by his good looks and 6&#x27;3&quot; height. When he decided not to continue studying, his mother, who later became an executive of a foreign film company, was disappointed because it was expected that he would follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as an insurance broker.

After working as a welder, cost accountant and aircraft-parts inspector during World War II, Williams became a salesman in the luggage department at Wanamaker&#x27;s. While there, he decided to send his photos to a modeling agency. He quickly found great success with assignments resulting in photographs in newspapers and magazines, including &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; as well as on billboards and book covers. He then adopted the name Guy Williams in the 1940s on the advice of his agent Henry Willson after a director refused to cast him because of his on-screen moniker, Guido Armando, that sounded &quot;too foreign&quot;.

In 1946, Williams signed a one-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and moved to Hollywood. For his debut, he had a featured role as the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; bombardier in the MGM docudrama &quot;The Beginning or the End&quot; (1947), about the development of the atom bomb. He appeared in only a few films afterwards and soon returned to New York.

In 1948, to advertise cigarettes while skiing, Williams did an extensive filming trip accompanied by Janice Cooper, a John Robert Powers model. During the long photographic sessions, they fell in love, marrying on December 8, just after they returned to New York City. They had two children, Guy Steven Catalano (aka Guy Williams Jr.) and Antoinette Catalano (aka Toni Williams); both became actors.

By 1950, Williams was filming some of the pioneering television commercials in the U.S. His father died in 1951, never to witness his son&#x27;s rise to fame. In 1952, Williams obtained a new one-year contract with Universal-International and moved to Hollywood. He also appeared in an episode of the Lone Ranger, playing a town sheriff.

===Early Hollywood (1951–1957)===
Guy Williams appeared in small supporting roles in films, including:
* &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) (uncredited) as Radar Operator at beginning of film
* &quot;Bonzo Goes to College&quot; (1952) – as Ronald Calkins
* &quot;The Mississippi Gambler&quot; (1953) – as Andre
* &quot;The Golden Blade&quot; (1953) – as Baghdad&#x27;s town crier
* &quot;The Man from the Alamo&quot; (1953) – as a sergeant
* &quot;Take Me to Town&quot; (1953) – as a small hero
* &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; (1955) – as Patrolman Hanson
* &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; (1957) – as police officer

In 1953, he suffered a serious accident when he fell from a horse and was dragged over 200 yards, resulting in a long scar on his left shoulder. Because of this he returned to New York to continue acting and modeling there and temporarily abandoned his film career. In 1953, he left Universal and became a freelancer for movies produced by Allied Artists and Warner Brothers.

===&quot;Zorro&quot; (1957–1959, 1960–1961)===

Early in 1957, Williams appeared twice in the role of Steve Clay in the television series &quot;Men of Annapolis&quot;, a military drama set at the United States Naval Academy. He also appeared in the Rod Cameron drama &quot;State Trooper&quot; in the episode &quot;No Fancy Cowboys&quot; about the defrauding of guests at a dude ranch.

About this time, the Walt Disney Company was casting for &quot;Zorro&quot;, a television series based on the character created in 1919 by Johnston McCulley: the young nobleman Don Diego de la Vega and his masked alter ego Zorro. To play the main character, the chosen actor would have to be handsome and have some experience with fencing. Walt Disney interviewed Guy Williams, telling him to start growing a mustache &quot;neither very long or thick.&quot; The exclusive contract paid Williams the then very high wage of $2,500 per week, equal to $ today. Williams resumed his professional training in fencing with the Belgian champion Fred Cavens (who also trained Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power), since the show required sword fights in most episodes. He also took guitar lessons with the famous Vicente Gomez. Williams&#x27; first appearance as Zorro was on the Disney anthology television series &quot;The Fourth Anniversary Show&quot;, wherein he challenged the notion that Zorro was a &quot;fictional&quot; character.

The series of half-hour episodes debuted on ABC on October 10, 1957. It was an instant hit in the U.S. Seventy-eight episodes were produced over two seasons (1957–1959), and two movies were edited from TV episodes: &quot;The Sign of Zorro&quot; (1958) and &quot;Zorro the Avenger&quot; (1959). The theme song was composed by Norman Foster and George Bruns and performed by The Mellomen; it reached #17 on the Hit Parade. In 1959, a legal dispute arose between Disney and ABC, causing a hiatus and the eventual cancellation of &quot;Zorro&quot;. However, four hour-long episodes were produced with the original primary cast, including Williams. These episodes were released as part of the &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot; series between October 30, 1960, and April 12, 1961.

On March 5, 1959, as &quot;Zorro&quot; was ending its original run, Williams was a guest star, along with Sally Brophy and Tom Nolan on &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.&quot;

In 1962, Williams played Sir Miles Hendon in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, shot in England.

===European films===
After finishing his contract with Disney, Guy Williams went to Europe to film two movies:
* &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot; (MGM production filmed in Italy in 1962, directed by Curtis Bernhardt), as Damon, the classic Greek hero who offers his life as warrant of the word of Pythias (played by Don Burnett), his friend who has been condemned to death for political reasons;
* &quot;Captain Sindbad&quot; (MGM production filmed in Germany in 1962, directed by Byron Haskin, based on the classic tale of the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;), in the role of Sindbad the Sailor.

===&quot;Bonanza&quot; (1964)===
In 1964, Guy Williams returned to Hollywood to resume his career, being added to the cast of the hit TV series &quot;Bonanza&quot; as Ben&#x27;s nephew Will Cartwright. Williams found himself written out of the series after five episodes despite being slated to become one of the four permanent leads. His character had been created as a replacement for Adam Cartwright, since actor Pernell Roberts planned to leave the show at the end of that season, thus allowing the format with four regular leads to continue. Fans wrote in to keep the original Cartwrights and producers held Roberts to his contract and kept him on for another season. 

===&quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1965–1968)===

In 1965, Guy Williams returned to weekly television in the popular science-fiction series &quot;Lost in Space&quot; with June Lockhart as his wife.

Guy Williams played Professor John Robinson, an expert in astrophysics and geology, who commanded the mission of the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; spaceship, taking his family in a voyage to colonize the Alpha Centauri star system.

===Retirement in Argentina (1979–1989)===

After &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, Guy Williams decided to retire in order to better enjoy his wealth which had been generated by investments in several businesses, buying and selling on the stock market.

When Williams had first visited Argentina in 1973, he was taken by the admiration and fascination the Argentine people expressed for him and his character of El Zorro. In return, Williams fell in love with the culture and people of Argentina. In the late 1970s, he retired, except for personal appearances, to Recoleta, an upscale neighborhood of Buenos Aires.

In subsequent years, Williams also brought to Argentina some of the original cast members of the &quot;Zorro&quot; series, including Henry Calvin who performed as Sergeant Garcia. Williams even formed a circus (Circo Real Madrid) with the local fencing champion, and later actor, Fernando Lupiz, traveling all over South America (1977).

In 1983, Williams returned to Los Angeles for three final television appearances. He joined &quot;Lost in Space&quot; cast members June Lockhart, Angela Cartwright, Bob May, and Marta Kristen for three celebrity episodes of &quot;Family Feud&quot; against the casts of &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, and &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; respectively. He later appeared as a guest on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

==Death==
In 1989, after spending solitary months in Argentina, it was reported that Williams had disappeared. The local police searched his apartment in Recoleta on May 6, 1989, finding his body. An autopsy revealed he died a week prior of a ruptured brain aneurysm.

Owing to his great popularity in Argentina, his ashes lay for two years at the Argentine Actors&#x27; Society cemetery at La Chacarita Cemetery, Actor Pantheon &amp; Crypt 278. In 1991, in accordance with his wishes, Williams&#x27; ashes were spread over the Pacific Ocean in Malibu, California.

==Homages==

* In 2000, Williams was the first local celebrity inducted into the Bronx Walk of Fame. He was represented at the ceremony by his son Steven Catalano (Guy Williams Jr.)
* In 2001, (August 2), he was posthumously granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 7080 Hollywood Blvd after petitions from thousands of his fans in front of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce in 2000.
* In October 2002, the fans of Williams, with his children Steven and Toni in attendance, dedicated to him a bench in New York&#x27;s Central Park.
* In August 2003, fans belonging to an online group Guy Williams&#x27; Friendslist, along with Williams&#x27; wife Janice, their children Steven and Toni, and Toni&#x27;s son Nando in attendance, placed a commemorative plaque dedicated to Williams in the Old Cemetery section of the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia at Oceanside, California, where the Zorro series was filmed in 1957. 
* In 2011, Williams was named a Disney Legend.

A number of books have been written which feature Williams, particularly in his role as Zorro. This includes the &quot;Zorro Television Companion&quot;, detailing the making of the Disney series, as well as a biography by Antoinette Girgenti Lane, &quot;Guy Williams: The Man Behind the Mask&quot; (2005).

A collection of original Zorro short stories, some inspired specifically by Guy Williams, was edited by Richard Dean Starr and released in 2008. It includes an introduction by Guy Williams Jr. (with Matthew Baugh) and an afterword by Isabel Allende. The cover art on the trade paperback edition by Douglas Klauba was a homage to Guy Williams.

<text>Jandarma İstihbarat ve Terörle Mücadele or Jandarma İstihbarat Teşkilatı (abbr. &quot;JİTEM&quot; or &quot;JİT&quot;; English: &quot;Gendarmerie Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism&quot; or &quot;Gendarmerie Intelligence Organization&quot;) is the intelligence department of the Turkish Gendarmerie. JİTEM was active in the Kurdish–Turkish conflict. After the Susurluk scandal, former prime ministers Bülent Ecevit and Mesut Yılmaz have confirmed the existence of JİTEM.

According to Murat Belge of Istanbul Bilgi University, who has reported that he was tortured in 1971 by its founder, Veli Küçük, JİTEM is an embodiment of the deep state. In other words, it is used by &quot;the Establishment&quot; to enforce alleged national interests. It is also said to be the military wing of Ergenekon, an underground Turkish nationalist organization. In 2008, long-maintained official denials of JİTEM&#x27;s existence started collapsing in the courts, as ex-members of Turkey&#x27;s &quot;deep state&quot; security apparatus testify to their participation in covert and illegal activities over the last few decades as part of the ongoing Ergenekon investigation.

==History==

===Background===

The unit was officially founded in 2005, but its unofficial history goes back to the 1980s. Its roots lie further back with the Counter-Guerrilla: JİTEM used Counter-Guerrilla methods and possibly equipment, and key figures had been involved with the Counter-Guerrilla. For example, Murat Belge of Istanbul Bilgi University says he was tortured in 1971 by a key JİTEM figure, Veli Küçük.

===Unofficial (1980s–2005)===
JİTEM was active in the Kurdish–Turkish conflict.

It has repeatedly been claimed that JİTEM was dissolved. One of the first was Prime Minister Mesut Yılmaz. He stated on 22 January 1998 on the &quot;Arena&quot; program on Kanal D hosted by Uğur Dündar that JİTEM did not exist any longer. When İsmail Hakkı Karadayı assumed the role of chief of general staff, (30 August 1994 – 30 August 1998), news stating the dissolution of JİTEM were leaked to the press. The last declaration about JİTEM&#x27;s dissolution came in 2004 from the former Commander of the Gendarmerie in the State of Emergency Region (Olağanüstü Hal, OHAL), retired Lieutenant- General Altay Tokat. Tokat stated in his interview with the newspaper &quot;Zaman&quot; that JİTEM was a “public disclosure of an intelligence unit that fought against the PKK in the OHAL region” and that it had “fulfilled its role and was dissolved&quot;.

The former chair of Diyarbakır Bar Association, Sezgin Tanrıkulu, however claims that JİTEM was not dissolved, but the cadres were not active at the moment.

===Official (2005–present)===
JİTEM was made a legal entity through Article 5 of the Law 2803 on the Establishment, Duties and Jurisdiction of Gendarmerie and Article 4 of the Law Concerning the Transfer of Our Borders, Coasts and Territorial Waters&#x27; Protection and Anti-Smuggling Activities to the Ministry of Internal Affairs No. 6815.

The gendarmerie intelligence, previously known as JİTEM or JİT, finally gained legal status with the Law Concerning Amendments to Some Laws No. 5397, accepted on 3 July 2005, effective since 23 July 2005 thus becoming the Gendarmerie Intelligence Department within the General Command of Gendarmerie. This law authorised the gendarmerie to carry out technical stakeouts.

== Investigation history ==

===1993–1996===
The first person to write about JİTEM was journalist Ayşe Önal for the &quot;Ateş&quot; newspaper on 2 July 1994. Önal had learned about it from Veli Küçük after being introduced to him through MIT spy and fellow journalist, Tuncay Güney. Önal and Küçük&#x27;s meeting did not go well, and Önal vowed to write about it. She followed through, and was promptly fired, along with nineteen of her coworkers.

Findings about JİTEM and Ersever were also published by researchers and journalists. One of the first and most detailed of these was by Soner Yalçın. Yalçın managed to interview Cem Ersever, subsequently publishing the interviews in his book &quot;Binbaşı Ersever&#x27;in İtirafları&quot; (&quot;Confessions of Major Ersever&quot;).

===Susurluk scandal===
JİTEM was subjected to parliamentary scrutiny during the Susurluk scandal, when commanders in the Gendarmerie repeatedly denied the existence of an overarching intelligence organization within the Gendarmerie. Susurluk commission member Fikri Sağlar said that the commanders denied its existence because the Gendarmerie formally acquired the legal capacity to conduct intelligence operations in 2005 (with Law 5397). The author of the Prime Ministry Inspection Board report, Kutlu Savaş, said JİTEM was created on Gendarmerie Commander Hulusi Sayın&#x27;s watch (1981–1985). The Parliamentary Investigation Committee&#x27;s report on Unsolved Political Murders in Various Regions of Our Country (10/90) dated 12 October 1995 and the summary by Istanbul National Security Court General Prosecutor dated 30 January 1997 are also worthy of consideration.

Investigations into the 1996 Susurluk scandal revealed some role for JİTEM. Former prime ministers Bülent Ecevit, and Mesut Yılmaz accepted the existence of JİTEM.

Seven months after the release of the Susurluk Report, a book entitled: &quot;Cem Ersever ve JİTEM Gerçeği&quot; (&quot;Cem Ersever and the JİTEM Fact&quot;), written by journalist Çetin Ağaşe, a friend of the Ersever family, was published. The appendix of the book contains documents such as the 1994 phone directory of the General Command of Gendarmerie, which contained the numbers of the JİTEM Group Commander and JİTEM units in each city. This was further proof of JİTEM&#x27;s official existence and of Ersever&#x27;s position within the chain of command.

===Abdülkadir Aygan===
Revelations have recently come from an informant named Abdülkadir Aygan (a former PKK member recruited by JİTEM, now a political refugee in Sweden) that it was founded by retired general Veli Küçük, who is currently arrested in the Ergenekon investigations. Other people allegedly involved in its founding are Ahmet Cem Ersever, Arif Doğan, Hasan Kundakçı, Hüseyin Kara, Hulusi Sayın and Aytekin Özen, according to Aygan. Küçük confirmed Aygan&#x27;s allegations about his cofounding the organization.

===Arif Doğan===
After being taken into custody, Arif Doğan admitted to being a founder of the organization, originally known as the Intelligence Group Command (), and that in 1990 he handed the reins to Veli Küçük. In 2005 he had denied the very existence of such an organization. After his release from prison Arif Doğan spoke to journalists of the news channel Habertürk TV in September 2010 and said that he alone had founded JİTEM and had &quot;frozen&quot; it in 1990. Concerning the structure of JİTEM Colonel Arif Doğan said: &quot;&quot;My staff was 10,000, including 620 women. They participated in operations and got 3,000 Lira for each head&quot;.&quot;

According to figures of the Justice Ministry about 1,950 PKK militants became confessors after arrest. Unofficial figures put the number of confessors that were used and paid in the fight against the PKK at 500.

== Modus operandi ==
Among the alleged members are ex-PKK-operatives (), besides non-commissioned officers and a few officers of the Gendarmerie. While Aygan listed several units as part of JİTEM such as the Gendarmerie General Command, the Intelligence Command, the Joint Group Command, the Regional Group Commands (of which there are seven), the Team Commands and small clandestine cells the lawyer Tahir Elçi, who is acting on behalf of victims of JİTEM said:&lt;br&gt; 
&quot;It is not possible to completely know the organizational structure of JİTEM; but it is understood that it was organized within the Gendarmerie, the centre being in Ankara and having group commands mostly in the South-East within the Regimental Commands of the provinces. They took their orders from the centre in Ankara and conducted three folded activities: gather intelligence, interrogate and carry out operations.&quot;

JİTEM carried out its activities using the &quot;staff system&quot; (&quot;eleman sistemi&quot;) and technical stakeout approaches. The information gathered was analysed, became intelligence and submitted to the Intelligence Group Command. Every report was assembled by the Intelligence Group Command and operation teams were dispatched accordingly.

== Actions ==

=== Fight against PKK ===
JİTEM was founded to counter the guerilla tactics of the PKK, but its units never directly clashed with armed groups of the PKK in the rural areas. They made use of PKK confessors (&quot;itirafçı&quot;) to kill PKK adherents, raid villages in guerilla dressing, detain, torture or make people &quot;disappear&quot;. Intelligence units did not have the necessary mechanisms in place to fight the PKK in open country. The inefficiency in the intelligence network made it impossible for land forces to perform specific operations, to prevent terror raids and to develop a strategy against PKK front activities.

The spokesperson of the Movement of Kurdish Democrats Ahmet Acar alleged that JİTEM fomented infighting in the PKK, while ensuring the perpetuation of both of the PKK, and by extension, itself. Kurdish-Turkish politician Abdülmelik Fırat maintained that JİTEM is connected to the PKK, while fighting it at the same time.

=== Political killings ===
Numerous people who claim to be or are purported to be JİTEM operatives have been accused of crimes such as kidnapping, intimidation, and extra-judicial killings of PKK members. Former JİTEM operative Aygan estimated that 80% of these killings were done by JİTEM. JİTEM interrogators are especially brutal since they belong to an organization that ostensibly does not exist, and hence they are not accountable. Aygan says that detainees are invariably killed. He provided about 30 names of victims.

Tuncay Güney, a former spy for the National Intelligence Organization who infiltrated JİTEM, alleged that Veli Küçük&#x27;s men, working for JİTEM, killed people using acid and buried the corpses in wells belonging to the state-owned Turkish Pipeline Corporation, BOTAŞ. Some have responded to the Şırnak Bar&#x27;s request for witnesses and families of victims to step forward. Ergenekon defendant Levent Ersöz has also been named in connection with the incidents, in Silopi.

There are no clear figures on the number of political killings in South-East Anatolia. According to intelligence units, 1550 unsolved murders were committed between 1990 and 2000 although the PKK claims that the accurate number exceeds 2000. The Human Rights Association estimates that between 1989 and 2008 JİTEM was involved in 5000 unsolved killings of journalists, human rights defenders, intellectuals and political activists and was responsible for 1,500 cases of &quot;disappearances&quot;. Former chair of Diyarbakır Bar Association Sezgin Tanrıkulu put the figures above 4,000, close to 5,000. He stated that one JİTEM operative, Ibrahim Babat, alone had been charged with 61 killings. In a documentary by Mehmet Hatman the figure of 4653 unsolved political killings between 1991 and 2000 was mentioned.

===High profile killings===
Some murders received a lot of press coverage.

====Vedat Aydın====
Vedat Aydın, the Diyarbakır branch chairman of the now-defunct People&#x27;s Labor Party (HEP), was found dead on a road near Malatya on 7 July 1991, two days after armed men had taken him from his home in Diyarbakir. The widow Sükran Aydın thinks her husband&#x27;s murder was a turning point and that there was a sudden increase in the number of unsolved murders in the country&#x27;s Southeast following his death. She believes that a clandestine unit within the gendarmerie was responsible for the murder. Only 18 years after the killing the public prosecutor in Diyarbakir opened a file seeking the detention of nine JİTEM members including the Major Aytekin Özen.

==== Musa Anter ====
Aygan said he had been part of a unit, alongside Cem Ersever and Arif Doğan, which had assassinated 72-year-old Kurdish writer Musa Anter in 1992 in Diyarbakır. Turkey was found guilty of this murder in 2006 by the European Convention on Human Rights, which fined Turkey for 28,500 euros.

==== Ahmet Cem Ersever ====
Former JİTEM commander Cem Ersever was assassinated in November 1993.
Aygan alleges that Arif Doğan and Veli Küçük&#x27;s superiors in Ankara ordered the assassination in order to take control of JİTEM from Ersever.

=== Drugs and weapons trafficking ===
JİTEM&#x27;s chief, Arif Doğan, was tried in the frame of the Yüksekova Gang (aka &quot;the gang with uniforms&quot;). According to &quot;Today&#x27;s Zaman&quot;, the &quot;Yüksekova Gang was an illegal organization formed in the Yüksekova district of Hakkari, headed by three high-ranking military personnel and various politicians that smuggled drugs and weapons.&quot; Its activities were first revealed in 1996, in the aftermath of the Susurluk scandal. Its activities &quot;are only one part of the JİTEM activities&quot; that have been sent to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). All of the local court prison sentences concerning the Yüksekova Gang were cancelled by the High Court of Appeals of Turkey, leading the ECHR to fine Turkey 103,000 Euro for its decisions about the Yüksekova Gang.

Relying on a document as an attachment to the indictment in the Ergenekon case Fırat News Agency presented background on smuggling of JİTEM staff between 1981 and 1990. Details were mentioned on arms trafficking, drug smuggling, and cross border trafficking of electronic devices.

== Court cases with JİTEM involvement ==
İlhan Cihaner, prosecutor in İdil (Şırnak province) was the first to point at JİTEM in an indictment of 1997. He held the defendants including civil servants, &quot;İtirafçı&quot; confessors and others responsible for killings, bombings and &quot;disappearances&quot;. Defendant No. 1 was Ahmet Cem Ersever and defendant No. 2 was Arif Doğan.

An indictment prepared by Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor Mithat Özcan dated 29 March 2005 charged eight PKK &quot;İtirafçı&quot; confessors, namely Mahmut Yıldırım (aka Yeşil), Abdülkadir Aygan, Muhsin Gül, Fethi Çetin, Kemal Emlük, Saniye Emlük, Yüksel Uğur and Abdülkerim Kırca. These people were suspected of being JİTEM members and were charged with eight unsolved murders, namely the murders of Harbi Arman, Lokman Zuğurli, Zana Zuğurli, Servet Aslan, Şahabettin Latifeci, Ahmet Ceylan, Mehmet Sıddık Etyemez and Abdülkadir Çelikbilek between the years 1992–1994. The case was transferred to a military court. The court case went through different stages. In September 2010 the number of defendants had risen to 15. During the hearing at Diyarbakir Heavy Penal Court No. 6 of 3 September 2010 the defendants Ali Ozansoy and Adil Timurtaş (both confessors) were present for the first time. Earlier the Ministry of Interior had refused to inform the Court of the new names of the defendants.

Mehmet Şerif Avşar was abducted in Diyarbakir on 22 April 1994 and two weeks later found dead. The kidnappers, PKK confessor Mesut Mehmetoğlu and village guards hid in a building reportedly belonging to JİTEM. On 20 March 2001 six defendants were convicted for their involvement in the killing. The case was raised with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The court found a violation of Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights.

Abdülkadir Aygan is one of the 11 or 12 defendants charged with having killed Hacı Ahmet Zeyrek (in Silopi 1989), JİTEM staff member Mehmet Bayar (25 June 1990) and Tahsin Sevim, Hasan Utanç and Hasan Caner on 16 September 1989. A criminal court in Diyarbakır ruled in 2006 that the defendants were military personnel and should be tried in a military court.

According to the report of Kutlu Savaş PKK &quot;İtirafçı&quot; confessor Hayrettin Toka had been involved in many killings of JİTEM. He was apprehended in Karamürsel in December 2005 and taken to Diyarbakir. A judge released him on 16 January 2006. In his testimony Toka stated that he had been imprisoned for 12.5 years.

Şırnak death well trials: on 11 September 2009 Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 6 started to hear the case of 7 defendants charged with 20 killings that had been committed between 1993 and 1995 when Colonel Cemil Temizöz had been the commander of Cizre Gendarmerie Station in Şırnak province, Cizre district. On 17 September 2010 the 18th hearing was held.

The 2005 Şemdinli incident involved Gendarmerie intelligence personnel and alleged links to JİTEM. Three men were sentenced to 39 years for murder in a grenade attack.

<text>Otto Johann Maximilian Strasser (also , see ß; 10 September 1897 – 27 August 1974) was a German politician and an early member of the Nazi Party. Otto Strasser, together with his brother Gregor Strasser, was a leading member of the party&#x27;s more radical wing, whose ideology became known as Strasserism, and broke from the party due to disputes with the dominant Hitlerite faction. He formed the Black Front, a group intended to split the Nazi Party and take it from the grasp of Hitler. During his exile and World War II, this group also functioned as a secret opposition group.

==Biography==
===Early life and World War I===
Born at Bad Windsheim, Strasser was the son of a Catholic judicial officer who lived in the Upper Bavarian market town of Geisenfeld. Strasser took an active part in World War I (1914–1918). On 2 August 1914, he joined the Bavarian Army as a volunteer. He rose through the ranks to lieutenant and was twice wounded.

===Freikorps and SPD (1919–1920)===
He returned to Germany in 1919, where he served in the Freikorps that in May 1919 put down the Bavarian Soviet Republic, which was organized on the principles of workers&#x27; councils. About this time, he joined the Social Democratic Party.

In 1920, he participated in the opposition to the Kapp Putsch. Still, he grew increasingly alienated from his party&#x27;s reformist stance, particularly when it put down a workers&#x27; uprising in the Ruhr, and he left the party later that year.

===Nazi Party (1925–1930)===
In 1925, he joined the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP), in which his brother, Gregor, had been a member for several years and worked for its newspaper as a journalist, ultimately taking it over with his brother. He focused particularly on the socialist elements of the party&#x27;s program and led the party&#x27;s faction in northern Germany together with his brother and Joseph Goebbels. His faction advocated support for ideologically Nazi unions, profit-sharing and – despite acknowledged differences – closer ties with the Soviet Union.

Despite disagreements with Hitler, the Strassers did not represent a radical wing opposed to the party mainstream. Gottfried Feder was more radical and held great favour at the time. The Strassers were extremely influential within the party, but the Strasserist programme was defeated at the Bamberg Conference of 1926. Otto Strasser, along with Gregor, continued as a leading Left Nazi within the party until he seceded from the NSDAP in 1930 following an aggressive attack led by Joseph Goebbels at a General Assembly on June 30, resulting in his expulsion from the meeting.

===Nazi dissident in Germany (1930–1933)===
On 1 July, Strasser telegraphed Hitler requesting an explanation for Goebbels&#x27; actions. None would come. Strasser then seceded from the National Socialists and set up his own party, the Black Front, composed of like-minded former NSDAP members, to split the Nazi Party. His party proved unable to counter Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933, and Strasser spent the years of the Nazi era in exile. The Strasserists were annihilated during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, during which Gregor Strasser was killed. This left Hitler as the undisputed party leader and was able to pacify the industrialists and military elite by ridding the party of the influence of people like Gregor Strasser and Ernst Röhm.

===Exile (1933–1955)===

In addition to the Black Front, Strasser at this time headed the Free German Movement outside Germany; this group (founded in 1941) sought to enlist the aid of Germans throughout the world in bringing about the downfall of Hitler and his vision of Nazism.

Strasser fled first to Austria, then to Czechoslovakia (Prague), Switzerland, and France. In 1940, he went to Bermuda by way of Portugal, leaving a wife and two children behind in Switzerland. In 1941, he emigrated to Canada, where he became the famed &quot;Prisoner of Ottawa&quot;. Goebbels denounced Strasser as the Nazis&#x27; &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot; and a price of $500,000 was set on his head. He settled for a time in Montreal. In 1942, he lived for a time in Clarence, Nova Scotia, on a farm owned by a German-Czech, Adolph Schmidt, then moved to nearby Paradise, where he lived for more than a decade in a rented apartment above a general store. As an influential and uncondemned former Nazi Party member still faithful to many doctrines of Nazism, he was initially prevented from returning to West Germany after the war, first by the Allied powers and then by the West German government.

During his exile, he wrote articles on Nazi Germany and its leadership for several British, American, and Canadian newspapers, including the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and a series for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, which was ghostwritten by then-&quot;Gazette&quot; reporter and later politician Donald C. MacDonald.

In 1950, East Germany invited Strasser to become a member of the National Front. Still, he declined, hoping that he would be permitted to return to Bavaria, which had been under US occupation until 1949. In his view, West Germany constituted an American colony and East Germany a Russian colony.

===Return to Germany and later career (1955–1974)===
Strasser eventually gained West German citizenship, returned to Germany on 16 March 1955, and settled in Munich.

He attempted to create a new &quot;nationalist and socialist&quot;-oriented party in 1956, the German Social Union (), but his organization was unable to attract meaningful support. Strasser continued to advocate for his vision of Nazism until he died in Munich in 1974.

==Stance on Nazi anti-Semitism==
Otto Strasser claimed to have dissented from Nazi racial policies. During his life, he claimed to have actively opposed such policies within the Nazi movement, for example, by organizing the removal of Julius Streicher from the German Peoples Freedom Party.

<doc id="579645" wikidata="Q421340" url="?curid=579645" title="Strontium titanate">
<text>Strontium titanate is an oxide of strontium and titanium with the chemical formula SrTiO3. At room temperature, it is a centrosymmetric paraelectric material with a perovskite structure. At low temperatures it approaches a ferroelectric phase transition with a very large dielectric constant ~104 but remains paraelectric down to the lowest temperatures measured as a result of quantum fluctuations, making it a quantum paraelectric. It was long thought to be a wholly artificial material, until 1982 when its natural counterpart—discovered in Siberia and named tausonite—was recognised by the IMA. Tausonite remains an extremely rare mineral in nature, occurring as very tiny crystals. Its most important application has been in its synthesized form wherein it is occasionally encountered as a diamond simulant, in precision optics, in varistors, and in advanced ceramics.

The name &quot;tausonite&quot; was given in honour of Lev Vladimirovich Tauson (1917–1989), a Russian geochemist. Disused trade names for the synthetic product include &quot;strontium mesotitanate&quot;, &quot;Diagem&quot;, and &quot;Marvelite&quot;. This product is currently being marketed for its use in jewelry under the name &quot;Fabulite&quot;. Other than its type locality of the Murun Massif in the Sakha Republic, natural tausonite is also found in Cerro Sarambi, Concepción department, Paraguay; and along the Kotaki River of Honshū, Japan.

== Properties ==

SrTiO3 has an indirect band gap of 3.25 eV and a direct gap of 3.75 eV in the typical range of semiconductors.
Synthetic strontium titanate has a very large dielectric constant (300) at room temperature and low electric field. It has a specific resistivity of over 109 Ω-cm for very pure crystals. It is also used in high-voltage capacitors.
Introducing mobile charge carriers by doping leads to Fermi-liquid metallic behavior already at very low charge carrier densities.
At high electron densities strontium titanate becomes superconducting below 0.35 K and was the first insulator and oxide discovered to be superconductive.

Strontium titanate is both much denser (specific gravity 4.88 for natural, 5.13 for synthetic) and much softer (Mohs hardness 5.5 for synthetic, 6–6.5 for natural) than diamond. Its crystal system is cubic and its refractive index (2.410—as measured by sodium light, 589.3 nm) is nearly identical to that of diamond (at 2.417), but the dispersion (the optical property responsible for the &quot;fire&quot; of the cut gemstones) of strontium titanate is 4.3x that of diamond, at 0.190 (B–G interval). This results in a shocking display of fire compared to diamond and diamond simulants such as YAG, GAG, GGG, Cubic Zirconia, and Moissanite.

Synthetics are usually transparent and colourless, but can be doped with certain rare earth or transition metals to give reds, yellows, browns, and blues. Natural tausonite is usually translucent to opaque, in shades of reddish brown, dark red, or grey. Both have an adamantine (diamond-like) lustre. Strontium titanate is considered extremely brittle with a conchoidal fracture; natural material is cubic or octahedral in habit and streaks brown. Through a hand-held (direct vision) spectroscope, doped synthetics will exhibit a rich absorption spectrum typical of doped stones. Synthetic material has a melting point of ca. 2080 °C (3776 °F) and is readily attacked by hydrofluoric acid. Under extremely low oxygen partial pressure, strontium titanate decomposes via incongruent sublimation of strontium well below the melting temperature.

At temperatures lower than 105 K, its cubic structure transforms to tetragonal. Its monocrystals can be used as optical windows and high-quality sputter deposition targets.
SrTiO3 is an excellent substrate for epitaxial growth of high-temperature superconductors and many oxide-based thin films. It is particularly well known as the substrate for the growth of the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface. Doping strontium titanate with niobium makes it electrically conductive, being one of the only conductive commercially available single crystal substrates for the growth of perovskite oxides. Its bulk lattice parameter of 3.905Å makes it suitable as the substrate for the growth of many other oxides, including the rare-earth manganites, titanates, lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO3), strontium ruthenate (SrRuO3) and many others. Oxygen vacancies are fairly common in SrTiO3 crystals and thin films. Oxygen vacancies induce free electrons in the conduction band of the material, making it more conductive and opaque. These vacancies can be caused by exposure to reducing conditions, such as high vacuum at elevated temperatures.

High-quality, epitaxial SrTiO3 layers can also be grown on silicon without forming silicon dioxide, thereby making SrTiO3 an alternative gate dielectric material. This also enables the integration of other thin film perovskite oxides onto silicon.

SrTiO3 can change its properties when it is exposed to light. These changes depend on the temperature and the defects in the material. SrTiO3 has been shown to possess persistent photoconductivity where exposing the crystal to light will increase its electrical conductivity by over 2 orders of magnitude. After the light is turned off, the enhanced conductivity persists for several days, with negligible decay. At low temperatures, the main effects of light are electronic, meaning that they involve the creation, movement, and recombination of electrons and holes (positive charges) in the material. These effects include photoconductivity, photoluminescence, photovoltage, and photochromism. They are influenced by the defect chemistry of SrTiO3, which determines the energy levels, band gap, carrier concentration, and mobility of the material. At high temperatures (&gt;200 °C), the main effects of light are photoionic, meaning that they involve the migration of oxygen vacancies (negative ions) in the material. These vacancies are the main ionic defects in SrTiO3, and they can alter the electronic structure, defect chemistry, and surface properties of the material. These effects include photoinduced phase transitions, photoinduced oxygen exchange, and photoinduced surface reconstruction. They are influenced by the oxygen pressure, the crystal structure, and the doping level of SrTiO3.

Due to the significant ionic and electronic conduction of SrTiO3, it is potent to be used as the mixed conductor.

== Synthesis ==
Synthetic strontium titanate was one of several titanates patented during the late 1940s and early 1950s; other titanates included barium titanate and calcium titanate. Research was conducted primarily at the National Lead Company (later renamed NL Industries) in the United States, by Leon Merker and Langtry E. Lynd. Merker and Lynd first patented the growth process on February 10, 1953; a number of refinements were subsequently patented over the next four years, such as modifications to the feed powder and additions of colouring dopants.

A modification to the basic Verneuil process (also known as flame-fusion) is the favoured method of growth. An inverted oxy-hydrogen blowpipe is used, with feed powder mixed with oxygen carefully fed through the blowpipe in the typical fashion, but with the addition of a third pipe to deliver oxygen—creating a &quot;tricone&quot; burner. The extra oxygen is required for successful formation of strontium titanate, which would otherwise fail to oxidize completely due to the titanium component. The ratio is ca. 1.5 volumes of hydrogen for each volume of oxygen. The highly purified feed powder is derived by first producing titanyl double oxalate salt (SrTiO(C2O4)2) by reacting strontium chloride (SrCl2) and oxalic acid ((COOH)2) with titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). The salt is washed to eliminate chloride, heated to 1000 °C in order to produce a free-flowing granular
powder of the required composition, and is then ground and sieved to ensure all particles are between 0.2 and 0.5 micrometres in size.

The feed powder falls through the oxyhydrogen flame, melts, and lands on a rotating and slowly descending pedestal below. The height of the pedestal is constantly adjusted to keep its top at the optimal position below the flame, and over a number of hours the molten powder cools and crystallises to form a single pedunculated pear or &quot;boule&quot; crystal. This boule is usually no larger than 2.5 centimetres in diameter and 10 centimetres long; it is an opaque black to begin with, requiring further annealing in an oxidizing atmosphere in order to make the crystal colourless and to relieve strain. This is done at over 1000 °C for 12 hours.

Thin films of SrTiO3 can be grown epitaxially by various methods, including pulsed laser deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, RF sputtering and atomic layer deposition. As in most thin films, different growth methods can result in significantly different defect and impurity densities and crystalline quality, resulting in a large variation of the electronic and optical properties.

== Use as a diamond simulant ==
Its cubic structure and high dispersion once made synthetic strontium titanate a prime candidate for simulating diamond. Beginning , large quantities of strontium titanate were manufactured for this sole purpose. Strontium titanate was in competition with synthetic rutile (&quot;titania&quot;) at the time, and had the advantage of lacking the unfortunate yellow tinge and strong birefringence inherent to the latter material. While it was softer, it was significantly closer to diamond in likeness. Eventually, however, both would fall into disuse, being eclipsed by the creation of &quot;better&quot; simulants: first by yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) and followed shortly after by gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG); and finally by the (to date) ultimate simulant in terms of diamond-likeness and cost-effectiveness, cubic zirconia.

Despite being outmoded, strontium titanate is still manufactured and periodically encountered in jewellery. It is one of the most costly of diamond simulants, and due to its rarity collectors may pay a premium for large i.e. &gt;2 carat (400 mg) specimens. As a diamond simulant, strontium titanate is most deceptive when mingled with melée i.e. &lt;0.20 carat (40 mg) stones and when it is used as the base material for a composite or &quot;doublet&quot; stone (with, e.g., synthetic corundum as the crown or top of the stone). Under the microscope, gemmologists distinguish strontium titanate from diamond by the former&#x27;s softness—manifested by surface abrasions—and excess dispersion (to the trained eye), and occasional gas bubbles which are remnants of synthesis. Doublets can be detected by a join line at the girdle (&quot;waist&quot; of the stone) and flattened air bubbles or glue visible within the stone at the point of bonding.

==Use in radioisotope thermoelectric generators==
Due to its high melting point and insolubility in water, strontium titanate has been used as a strontium-90-containing material in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), such as the US Sentinel and Soviet Beta-M series. As strontium-90 has a high fission product yield and is easily extracted from spent nuclear fuel, Sr-90 based RTGs can in principle be produced cheaper than those based on plutonium-238 or other radionuclides which have to be produced in dedicated facilities. However, due to the lower power density (~0.45W thermal per gram of Strontium-90-Titanate) and half life, space based applications, which put a particular premium on low weight, high reliability and longevity prefer Plutonium-238. Terrestrial off-grid applications of RTGs meanwhile have been largely phased out due to concern over orphan sources and the decreasing price and increasing availability of solar panels, small wind turbines, chemical battery storage and other off-grid power solutions.

==Use in solid oxide fuel cells==
Strontium titanate&#x27;s mixed conductivity has attracted attention for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). It demonstrates both electronic and ionic conductivity which is useful for SOFC electrodes because there is an exchange of gas and oxygen ions in the material and electrons on both sides of the cell.

:(anode)
:(cathode)

Strontium titanate is doped with different materials for use on different sides of a fuel cell. On the fuel side (anode), where the first reaction occurs, it is often doped with lanthanum to form lanthanum-doped strontium titanate (LST). In this case, the A-site, or position in the unit cell where strontium usually sits, is sometimes filled by lanthanum instead, this causes the material to exhibit n-type semiconductor properties, including electronic conductivity. It also shows oxygen ion conduction due to the perovskite structure tolerance for oxygen vacancies. This material has a thermal coefficient of expansion similar to that of the common electrolyte yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), chemical stability during the reactions which occur at fuel cell electrodes, and electronic conductivity of up to 360 S/cm under SOFC operating conditions. Another key advantage of these LST is that it shows a resistance to sulfur poisoning, which is an issue with the currently used nickel - ceramic (cermet) anodes.

Another related compound is strontium titanium ferrite (STF) which is used as a cathode (oxygen-side) material in SOFCs. This material also shows mixed ionic and electronic conductivity which is important as it means the reduction reaction which happens at the cathode can occur over a wider area. Building on this material by adding cobalt on the B-site (replacing titanium) as well as iron, we have the material STFC, or cobalt-substituted STF, which shows remarkable stability as a cathode material as well as lower polarization resistance than other common cathode materials such as lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite. These cathodes also have the advantage of not containing rare earth metals which make them cheaper than many of the alternatives.

<text>Mojo HD was an American VOD television channel, owned by In Demand LLC. As a linear television channel, it replaced INHD on May 1, 2007. In Demand, the owner of Mojo HD, canceled its Mojo HD regularly scheduled programming on December 1, 2008, but continued to provide video on demand programming and sales of their programs on optical media.

== Overview ==

The channel is owned by In Demand L.L.C. On January 1, 2007, In Demand ceased operations of INHD2 (stylized as &quot;INHD2&quot;), and in May, renamed INHD &quot;Mojo HD&quot; as a non-pay per view 24-hour basic cable channel. Until December 1, 2008, Mojo HD was available on Bright House Networks, Cablevision, Charter, Comcast, Cox, Time Warner Cable, Mediacom, and Midcontinent cable systems. The network had broadcast all content in high definition 1080i format and 5.1 audio to cable subscribers with HD service, usually at no additional charge. The channel featured original programming, movies and sports programming geared to the lifestyle interests of affluent males; its website (www.mojohd.com) continues to feature streaming episodes, interactive forums, and a store for its content on DVD. Mojo HD programming also continues on other digital platforms such as iTunes, Amazon.com, Hulu and others.

== Programming ==

Mojo HD aired original programming series such as &quot;After Hours with Daniel&quot;, &quot;Three Sheets&quot;, &quot;I Bet You&quot;, &quot;Pressure Cook&quot;, &quot;Wall Street Warriors&quot;, &quot;Bobby G: Adventure Capitalist&quot;, &quot;Start-Up Junkies&quot;, &quot;Dr. Danger&quot;, &quot;The King of Miami&quot;, &quot;The Show&quot;, &quot;Technology Jones&quot;, and &quot;Uncorked with Billy Merritt&quot;. Other shows include &quot;London Live&quot;, &quot;Getting Abroad&quot;, &quot;Hooked&quot;, &quot;Timeless&quot; and &quot;Beer Nutz&quot;.

Mojo HD aired select NBA TV games in HD, when many cable providers did not yet carry NBA TV HD; games were blacked out on systems which did not carry NBA TV, or if the game aired in a team&#x27;s market, where the team&#x27;s broadcaster received preference. Some cable systems used Mojo HD for RSN HD over flow feeds.

The channel acquired the off-network rights for &quot;Heroes&quot; in high definition starting in October 2007, and aired several episodes leading up to the network premiere in September 2008. G4 later took both the regular broadcast and HD rights, as their HD channel launched on the day Mojo HD ended operations.

<doc id="579662" wikidata="Q2189476" url="?curid=579662" title="The Science of Discworld">
<text>The Science of Discworld is a 1999 book by novelist Terry Pratchett and popular science writers (and University of Warwick science researchers) Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Three sequels, &quot;The Science of Discworld II: The Globe&quot;, &quot;The Science of Discworld III: Darwin&#x27;s Watch&quot;, and &quot;The Science of Discworld IV: Judgement Day&quot;, have been written by the same authors.

Following publication of the first book in 1999 Terry Pratchett made both Jack Cohen and Professor Ian Stewart &quot;Honorary Wizards of the Unseen University&quot; at the same ceremony at which the University of Warwick gave Terry Pratchett an honorary degree.

The book alternates between a typically absurd &quot;Discworld&quot; story and serious scientific exposition after each chapter.

The cover of the book, designed by Paul Kidby, is a parody of the 1768 painting &quot;An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump&quot; by Joseph Wright of Derby.

==Plot summary==

The Discworld part of the book begins when a new experimental power source for the Unseen University is commissioned in the university&#x27;s squash court. The new &quot;reactor&quot; is capable of splitting the &quot;thaum&quot; (the basic particle of magic), in homage to the Chicago Pile-1 nuclear reactor, which was housed in a rackets court at the University of Chicago.

However, the wizards&#x27; new reactor produces vastly more magical energy than planned and threatens to explode, destroying the University, the Discworld, and the entire universe. The university&#x27;s thinking engine, Hex, decides to divert all the magic into creating a space containing nothing—no matter, no energy, no reality, and, importantly, no magic. The Dean sticks his fingers in the space and &quot;twiddles&quot; them, inadvertently creating the universe. The wizards soon discover that they can move things around in the universe, using Hex. They call it the Roundworld (the Earth), because in it, matter seems to accrete into balls in space (instead of discs on the backs of turtles). They decide to appoint Rincewind, whom they dragged out of bed in the early hours of the morning, the Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography, and send him down (against his will) to investigate this strange world.

The wizards create a series of balls of matter in space, and give one of them a Moon (accidentally). This stabilizes the ball enough that, over a score of millennia (the wizards can skip over vast periods of Roundworld time, allowing them to view the history of the universe in less than a month), blobs of life emerge, ready to begin evolving into more complex forms. The book also features a fictional crab civilization and the dinosaurs (both of which are wiped out by comets/asteroids colliding with the earth), before jumping ahead to when an advanced civilization (presumably humans) has evacuated the earth due to an impending natural disaster.

==Ideas and themes==

The science centres on the origins of the universe, earth and the beginnings of life, the fiction on the creation of a world (the Earth) in a jar. One of the themes is that most scientific explanations are in reality a good deal more complicated than most of us realize. It is explained that this is because their teachers use Lies-To-Children or, in Ponder Stibbons&#x27; case, Lies-To-Wizards.

The even-numbered chapters are self-contained essays that discuss, among others, the following topics:
* Squash Court Science: Nuclear energy. 
* Science and Magic: What is science and how it works. 
* Beginnings and Becomings: The origin and nature of the Universe. 
* We are Stardust: Atoms. The periodic table. 
* The Shape of Things: The shape of the Universe; the Theory of Relativity. 
* Where do Rules Come From?: Is a &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; possible?; Quantum Mechanics. 
* Disc Worlds. The Solar System. 
* Earth and Fire. Geology: the structure of planet Earth. 
* Air and Water. The atmosphere, the oceans, the surface of the planet. 
* A Giant Leap for Moonkind: the moon. 
* Things that aren&#x27;t: things that are defined by being opposites, normally with only one of them being measurable and not both (light, heat, etc.). 
* Despite which...: The origin of life. 
* Unnatural Selection: Evolution. 
* The Descent of Darwin: Evolution. 
* The Iceberg Cometh: Ice Ages. 
* Universals and Parochials: Evolution. 
* Don&#x27;t Look Up: Meteors and other things that might cause another global extinction. 
* Nine Times out of Ten: Statistics and biases. 
* Running from Dinosaurs: dinosaurs. 
* The Death of Dinosaurs. 
* Mammals on the Make: the expansion of mammals. 
* Anthill Inside: The origin of hominids. 
* Extel Outside: Culture. 
* Ways to Leave your Planet: space travel. 
* Eden and Camelot. Conclusion.
The concept of narrativium, introduced in the book (a fictional element responsible for the creation of narrative, a parody of phlogiston), has been used by Pratchett and his co-authors to explore the role of narratives in real-world literature and science.

==Reception==

Publishers Weekly, reviewing the 2014 edition, described it as &quot;unique and outrageously funny&quot;, with &quot;writing [that] is as entertaining as it is accessible.&quot; The &quot;New England Science Fiction Association&quot; considered it &quot;a fine popularization of science and of the scientific method&quot;, and &quot;most unusual and entertaining&quot;, but observed that this makes it &quot;something of an oddity&quot;.

The book and its sequel, &quot;The Science of Discworld II: The Globe&quot;, have been reviewed by Ian C.W Hardy for &quot;Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution&quot;. Writing about the first book, he noted that it &quot;deals with the ontogeny of our universe and recapitulates phylogeny&quot;, or, in simpler words, the authors &quot;give us their take on chimpanzees and human origins, brains, pattern recognition, self-awareness, self-referentiality, cultural evolution and space exploration&quot;. He concluded that the books are a &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;engaging&quot; example of popular science writing. 

==Origins==
Cohen reports that it was extremely difficult to find a publisher who was willing to purchase the book, saying &quot;I spent two-and-a-half years going around editors. I must have had 80 [meetings with editors]. And they all said &#x27;don&#x27;t be stupid&#x27;. At last Ebury took it. The editor there was made to understand that if it sold less than 10,000 copies, he&#x27;d lose his job. (...) It sold more than 200,000 copies in the first year.&quot; He also states that the books were inspired by a &quot;bloody awful&quot; book on the science of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and noted that Pratchett was initially reluctant to write about science on the Discworld &quot;because there isn&#x27;t any science on the Discworld&quot;.

Stewart discussed his views on the book series in his paper &quot;Mathematics, the media, and the public&quot;.

<doc id="579667" wikidata="Q259495" url="?curid=579667" title="Mary Miles Minter">
<text>Mary Miles Minter (born Juliet Reilly; April 25, 1902– August 4, 1984) was an American actress, and one of the leading ladies who established the early Hollywood star system. She appeared in 53 silent films from 1912 to 1923.

In 1922, Minter was involved in a scandal surrounding the murder of director William Desmond Taylor, for whom she professed her love. Gossip implicated her mother, former actress Charlotte Shelby, as the murderer, and as a result Minter&#x27;s reputation was tarnished. She gave up her film career in 1923.

==Early life==
Minter was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the younger of two daughters born to J. Homer Reilly and Lily Pearl Miles (later known as Broadway actress Charlotte Shelby; 1877–1957). Her sister was Margaret Reilly, who later became an actress using the name Margaret Shelby.

==Career==
===Stage and film career===

At the age of five, she accompanied her sister Margaret on an audition because no babysitter was available. She was noticed by the director and given her first part. She began her stage career and frequently was employed afterward, widely noted for both her talent and visual appeal. To avoid child labor laws while the 10-year-old was appearing in a play in Chicago in 1912, Charlotte Shelby obtained the birth certification of her older sister&#x27;s deceased daughter from Louisiana, and Juliet became Mary Miles Minter. 

In her screen debut, in which she was billed as Juliet Shelby, she appeared in the 1-reel short film &quot;The Nurse&quot; (1912). Her new stage name was applied, and Minter starred in the role as Viola Drayton, the fairy, in the 5-reel drama &quot;The Fairy and the Waif&quot; (1915). A reviewer in the New York Dramatic Mirror declared: “Mary Miles Minter is the greatest child actress to be seen either on stage or before the camera. She is exquisitely fascinating, sympathetically charming, and delightfully childlike and human.”

Minter&#x27;s career steadily grew after that. She specialized in playing demure young women. With her photogenic features, blue eyes, and blonde curls, she emulated and later rivaled Mary Pickford.

Her first movie for director William Desmond Taylor was &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1919). It was well-received, and Taylor actively promoted Minter. According to Minter, a romantic relationship developed between them. However, Minter (who had grown up fatherless) said Taylor had reservations from the outset and later curtailed the romance, citing their 30-year age difference. Other people who knew Taylor and Minter said he never reciprocated her feelings. 

===Scandal===
On February 1, 1922, Taylor was murdered in his home, a two-story bungalow apartment on Alvarado Street, at the southeast corner of Alvarado and Maryland Street in the Westlake area of Los Angeles.

The ensuing scandal, following the Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle scandal of Labor Day weekend 1921, and Arbuckle&#x27;s murder trials, was the subject of widespread media speculation and embellishment. Newspapers reported that coded love letters written by Minter had been found in his bungalow after his death (these were later shown to have been written three years earlier in 1919). Minter was at the height of her success, having starred in more than 50 films, and newspaper revelations of the 20-year-old star&#x27;s association with the 49-year-old murdered director was cause for a sensational scandal.

There were several suspects (including her mother Charlotte Shelby) in the long investigation of Taylor&#x27;s murder. In 1937, Minter publicly announced to the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; newspaper: &quot;Now I demand that I either be prosecuted for the murder committed fifteen years ago, or exonerated completely. If the District Attorney has any evidence, he should prosecute. If not, then I should be exonerated... Shadows have been cast upon my reputation.&quot; Taylor&#x27;s murder was never solved, but neither film actress Mabel Normand (who was the last person to see Taylor alive), nor Minter was ever regarded as a serious suspect in the murder by police investigators.

In a 1970 interview, during which she described Taylor as her &quot;mate,&quot; Minter recalled going to view Taylor&#x27;s body immediately after the murder. In shock, she demanded to be used for a blood transfusion to revive him, not believing he was dead until she touched his body in the morgue: &quot;That deadly cold... convinced me as nothing else could have done. No life can return to this man.&quot; She broke down and sobbed: &quot;They crucified Jesus. Now they&#x27;ve crucified... They&#x27;ve crucified my mate.&quot;

===Later career and retirement===
Minter made four more motion pictures for Paramount, with her last being &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot; (1923). The studio did not renew her contract: she was 23 years old. She received many other offers but declined them all, saying she had never been happy as an actress.

==Personal life==

Minter was involved with James Kirkwood Sr. for a time in 1916 when she was 15 years old. Minter and Kirkwood &quot;married&quot; without benefit of clergy in the countryside near Santa Barbara. The relationship ended after Minter became pregnant by Kirkwood and underwent an abortion, which was paid for by her mother.

In late 1922, several months after Taylor&#x27;s death, Minter became involved romantically for a time with then-news correspondent of Los Angeles and movie critic Louis Sherwin, who had at one time been married to actress Maude Fealy.

In 1925, Minter sued her mother for an accounting of the money Shelby had received for her during her screen career. The case was settled out of court, with the settlement being signed by Minter and Shelby at the American consulate in Paris, France, on January 24, 1927.

In 1934, a hearing took place in Los Angeles, in which Hilda Desey, the proprietor of a dress shop on Wilshire Blvd., claimed that Minter entered her shop and took a tweed dress valued at $55.00 by force. Minter countered in court by stating that she had helped finance Miss Desey&#x27;s dress shop and that she took the dress as she was owed interest. The deputy district attorney declined to issue a complaint for either petty theft or malicious mischief, as it was decided that there was no evidence of malicious intent on the part of Minter.

In 1957, Minter and real estate developer Brandon O. Hildebrandt (1898–1965) were married. They remained married until Hildebrandt&#x27;s death in 1965.

==Later years==
Minter commented she was content to live without her Hollywood career. She later reconciled with her mother and proclaimed her love for Taylor throughout her life. Minter&#x27;s money had been invested in Los Angeles real estate, and she seems to have lived in relative comfort and prosperity. She later moved to a house in Santa Monica, California; her mother Charlotte Shelby died there in 1957. 

In 1981, Minter was severely beaten in a burglary at her home in which more than $300,000 worth of antiques, china and jewelry were taken. A former live-in companion and three other people were charged with attempted murder and burglary. The police described her as a frail old woman, and people often were shocked to learn she had been a famous movie star. 

Minter died in 1984 at age 82 from a stroke in Santa Monica. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered at sea. For her contribution to movies, she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1724 Vine Street in Hollywood.

==Legacy==
Much of Minter&#x27;s work has been lost; of her 53 films, approximately a dozen are known to exist today. A print of her 1919 movie &quot;The Ghost of Rosy Taylor&quot; surfaced in New Zealand in the 1990s. Other known surviving movies include &quot;The Fairy and the Waif&quot; (1915), &quot;Youth&#x27;s Endearing Charm&quot; (1916), &quot;A Dream or Two Ago&quot; (1916), &quot;The Innocence of Lizette&quot; (1916), &quot;The Eyes of Julia Deep&quot; (1918), &quot;Nurse Marjorie&quot; (1920), &quot;A Cumberland Romance&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Little Clown&quot; (1921).

Film historian Edward Wagenknecht provides this retrospective observation regarding Minter’s film legacy:
Wagenknecht adds: “Miss Minter was well aware of this, young as she was, and deeply distressed by it.”

<text>A paca (from Tupí &quot;paka&quot;) is a member of the genus Cuniculus of ground-dwelling, herbivorous rodents in South and Central America. It is the only genus in the family Cuniculidae. Pacas are large rodents with dots and stripes on their sides, short ears, and barely visible tails. Pacas are eaten by people in Belize, where they are known as &quot;gibnut&quot; and, having been served to Queen Elizabeth II, &quot;the royal rat&quot;. In the Amazon basin they are known as &quot;majás&quot;. In Guyanese English, it is known as labba from Arawak.

==Evolutionary background==
Pacas originated in South America and are one of the few mammal species that successfully emigrated to North America after the Great American Interchange . They were formerly grouped with the agoutis in the family Dasyproctidae, subfamily Agoutinae, but were given full family status because they differ in the number of toes, the shape of the skull, and coat patterning.

==Description==
Pacas are in length, excluding the short tail, weigh , and are the sixth-largest rodents in the world. Similar to guinea pigs, they have square heads, small ears, sides patterned with spots and stripes, and virtually invisible tails.

With large hind limbs, small fore limbs, and cone-shaped bodies, pacas are similar in appearance to the deer-like, ungulate chevrotains, and like them have four to seven horizontal lines of blotches and stripes along their flanks. They have a heavy and robust appearance, though their legs are long and relatively tiny. Their small ears are set high on their heads. They have four toes on their fore feet and five on their hind feet (of which two are short and hardly touch the ground) and they have stout nails that resemble small hooves. In young pacas, the skin is covered with horny scales about in diameter; perhaps these scales have a protective function against smaller predators. There is virtually no difference between sexes. They can live up to 13 years in the wild.

==Behavior==
Pacas inhabit rainforests, cloud forests, and sometimes more open habitats. They are great swimmers and prefer to be near water. They dive when threatened and can stay submerged up to 15 minutes. They can also jump up to and freeze for up to 45 minutes. They normally move along well-established paths and will create new paths when old ones are disturbed.

They are normally passive in daytime and forage in the morning and afternoon, but can be strictly nocturnal in areas with many predators. They live in burrows up to deep, normally with two entrances covered with leaves to hide the burrow and to serve as an early warning system. Burrows are often near water, but always above the seasonal flood line. Predators except humans include jaguar, puma, ocelot, margay, jaguarundi, bush dog, boa constrictor, and caiman.

Pacas have resonating chambers in their cheeks and their growling noise is surprisingly loud for their size. Aside from making noises, territories are marked with urine. Population density can reach up to 70 adults per , and pacas often constitute some 20% of the biomass of terrestrial mammals.

==Feeding==

In the wild, pacas eat fruits from understory trees and fallen fruits from taller trees, but may also eat leaves, buds, flowers, fungi, and insects. They play a vital role in seed dispersal, and, with seasonal adaptations, their home ranges are often centered on a group of fruit trees. Pacas normally do not use their fore-paws to manipulate fruits (as do agoutis), instead using their powerful jaw muscles to break open hard-shelled fruits. Unlike agoutis, pacas can store fat, and so are less dependent on the caching of seeds. Competition from agoutis is avoided by a slight variation in activity cycles and food preferences. Like rabbits, pacas are coprophagous and absorb protein and carbohydrates from specially produced moist fecal pellets. Before allowing their young to suckle, mothers lick them to stimulate them to defecate and urinate, and then lick the resulting product, both to feed herself and to prevent the odour from attracting predators.

==Reproduction==
Gestation lasts between 114 and 119 days with about 190 days between births. Pacas are precocial, the young are born with fur and open eyes. Normally, mothers give birth to one young, but she can give birth up to three times per year if conditions allow. More than one birth per year results in lactation periods overlapping pregnancies. Weaning begins after six weeks, but the young start to follow their mothers early and can do so for up to a year.

Sexual maturity is reached after 6–12 months, when females weigh about and males . Pacas usually mate in water. As the male approaches the female, she starts to hop enthusiastically, more so if he sprays her with urine. Pacas have altered the common rodent strategy — safety in numbers — and mind their offspring carefully. At at birth, the young are born in holes too small for both predators and the mother to enter, which are then covered with leaves and twigs. To invite the young out of the hole, the mother uses a low rolling vocalization. Suckling usually lasts for 90 days, after which the young weighs .

==Distribution and habitat==
The lowland paca is found from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. They primarily live in rainforests near streams, but can also be found in a wide variety of habitats, including mangrove swamps, gallery forests near water currents, and even in public parks. They have been observed up to above sea level.

The smaller mountain paca lives in the northern Andes and the Páramo grasslands, with a peak occurrence between above sea level.

==Species==
The mountain paca has longer and darker fur than the lowland paca. Observations indicate mountain pacas are found between above sea level.

* Mountain paca, &quot;Cuniculus taczanowskii&quot;
* &quot;Cuniculus hernandezi&quot; (a recent and disputed &quot;nomen nudum&quot;)

== Potential use by humans ==
The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama has studied the possibilities of developing the paca as a food supply for people in the tropics.

<text>Jean-Yves Girard (; born 1947) is a French logician working in proof theory. He is a research director (emeritus) at the mathematical institute of University of Aix-Marseille, at Luminy.

== Biography ==

Jean-Yves Girard is an alumnus of the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud.

He made a name for himself in the 1970s with his proof of strong normalization in a system of second-order logic called System F. This result gave a new proof of Takeuti&#x27;s conjecture, which was proven a few years earlier by William W. Tait, Motō Takahashi and Dag Prawitz. For this purpose, he introduced the notion of &quot;reducibility candidate&quot; (&quot;candidat de réducibilité&quot;). He is also credited with the discovery of Girard&#x27;s paradox, linear logic, the geometry of interaction, ludics, and (satirically) the mustard watch.

He obtained the CNRS Silver Medal in 1983 and is a member of the French Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="579675" wikidata="Q841728" url="?curid=579675" title="Linear logic">
<text>Linear logic is a substructural logic proposed by French logician Jean-Yves Girard as a refinement of classical and intuitionistic logic, joining the dualities of the former with many of the constructive properties of the latter. Although the logic has also been studied for its own sake, more broadly, ideas from linear logic have been influential in fields such as programming languages, game semantics, and quantum physics (because linear logic can be seen as the logic of quantum information theory), as well as linguistics, particularly because of its emphasis on resource-boundedness, duality, and interaction.

Linear logic lends itself to many different presentations, explanations, and intuitions.
Proof-theoretically, it derives from an analysis of classical sequent calculus in which uses of (the structural rules) contraction and weakening are carefully controlled. Operationally, this means that logical deduction is no longer merely about an ever-expanding collection of persistent &quot;truths&quot;, but also a way of manipulating &quot;resources&quot; that cannot always be duplicated or thrown away at will. In terms of simple denotational models, linear logic may be seen as refining the interpretation of intuitionistic logic by replacing cartesian (closed) categories by symmetric monoidal (closed) categories, or the interpretation of classical logic by replacing Boolean algebras by C*-algebras.

==Connectives, duality, and polarity==
===Syntax===

The language of &quot;classical linear logic&quot; (CLL) is defined inductively by the BNF notation

Here and range over logical atoms. For reasons to be explained below, the connectives ⊗, ⅋, 1, and ⊥ are called &quot;multiplicatives&quot;, the connectives &amp;, ⊕, ⊤, and 0 are called &quot;additives&quot;, and the connectives ! and ? are called &quot;exponentials&quot;. 
We can further employ the following terminology:


Binary connectives ⊗, ⊕, &amp; and ⅋ are associative and commutative; 1 is the unit for ⊗, 0 is the unit for ⊕, ⊥ is the unit for ⅋ and ⊤ is the unit for &amp;. 

Every proposition in CLL has a dual , defined as follows:

Observe that is an involution, i.e., for all propositions. is also called the &quot;linear negation&quot; of .

The columns of the table suggest another way of classifying the connectives of linear logic, termed : the connectives negated in the left column (⊗, ⊕, 1, 0, !) are called &quot;positive&quot;, while their duals on the right (⅋, &amp;, ⊥, ⊤, ?) are called &quot;negative&quot;; cf. table on the right.

 is not included in the grammar of connectives, but is definable in CLL using linear negation and multiplicative disjunction, by . The connective ⊸ is sometimes pronounced &quot;lollipop&quot;, owing to its shape.

==Sequent calculus presentation==

One way of defining linear logic is as a sequent calculus. We use the letters and to range over lists of propositions , also called &quot;contexts&quot;. A &quot;sequent&quot; places a context to the left and the right of the turnstile, written . Intuitively, the sequent asserts that the conjunction of entails the disjunction of (though we mean the &quot;multiplicative&quot; conjunction and disjunction, as explained below). Girard describes classical linear logic using only &quot;one-sided&quot; sequents (where the left-hand context is empty), and we follow here that more economical presentation. This is possible because any premises to the left of a turnstile can always be moved to the other side and dualised.

We now give inference rules describing how to build proofs of sequents.

First, to formalize the fact that we do not care about the order of propositions inside a context, we add the structural rule of exchange:

Note that we do not add the structural rules of weakening and contraction, because we do care about the absence of propositions in a sequent, and the number of copies present.

Next we add &quot;initial sequents&quot; and &quot;cuts&quot;:

The cut rule can be seen as a way of composing proofs, and initial sequents serve as the units for composition. In a certain sense these rules are redundant: as we introduce additional rules for building proofs below, we will maintain the property that arbitrary initial sequents can be derived from atomic initial sequents, and that whenever a sequent is provable it can be given a cut-free proof. 
Ultimately, this canonical form property (which can be divided into the completeness of atomic initial sequents and the cut-elimination theorem, inducing a notion of analytic proof) lies behind the applications of linear logic in computer science, since it allows the logic to be used in proof search and as a resource-aware lambda-calculus.

Now, we explain the connectives by giving &quot;logical rules&quot;. Typically in sequent calculus one gives both &quot;right-rules&quot; and &quot;left-rules&quot; for each connective, essentially describing two modes of reasoning about propositions involving that connective (e.g., verification and falsification). 
In a one-sided presentation, one instead makes use of negation: the right-rules for a connective (say ⅋) effectively play the role of left-rules for its dual (⊗). 
So, we should expect a certain &quot;harmony&quot; between the rule(s) for a connective and the rule(s) for its dual.

===Multiplicatives===

The rules for multiplicative conjunction (⊗) and disjunction (⅋):

and for their units:

Observe that the rules for multiplicative conjunction and disjunction are admissible for plain &quot;conjunction&quot; and &quot;disjunction&quot; under a classical interpretation
(i.e., they are admissible rules in LK).

===Additives===

The rules for additive conjunction (&amp;) and disjunction (⊕) :

and for their units:

Observe that the rules for additive conjunction and disjunction are again admissible under a classical interpretation. 
But now we can explain the basis for the multiplicative/additive distinction in the rules for the two different versions of conjunction: for the multiplicative connective (⊗), the context of the conclusion () is split up between the premises, whereas for the additive case connective (&amp;) the context of the conclusion () is carried whole into both premises.

===Exponentials===

The exponentials are used to give controlled access to weakening and contraction. Specifically, we add structural rules of weakening and contraction for &#x27;d propositions:

and use the following logical rules, in which stands for a list of propositions each prefixed with :

One might observe that the rules for the exponentials follow a different pattern from the rules for the other connectives, resembling the inference rules governing modalities in sequent calculus formalisations of the normal modal logic S4, and that there is no longer such a clear symmetry between the duals and . 
This situation is remedied in alternative presentations of CLL (e.g., the LU presentation).

==Remarkable formulas==

In addition to the De Morgan dualities described above, some important equivalences in linear logic include:

By definition of as , the last two distributivity laws also give:

; Exponential isomorphism :

; Linear distributions :

A map that is not an isomorphism yet plays a crucial role in linear logic is:

Linear distributions are fundamental in the proof theory of linear logic. The consequences of this map were first investigated in and called a &quot;weak distribution&quot;. In subsequent work it was renamed to &quot;linear distribution&quot; to reflect the fundamental connection to linear logic.

; Other implications :

The following distributivity formulas are not in general an equivalence, only an implication:



==Encoding classical/intuitionistic logic in linear logic==

Both intuitionistic and classical implication can be recovered from linear implication by inserting exponentials: intuitionistic implication is encoded as , while classical implication can be encoded as or (or a variety of alternative possible translations). The idea is that exponentials allow us to use a formula as many times as we need, which is always possible in classical and intuitionistic logic.

Formally, there exists a translation of formulas of intuitionistic logic to formulas of linear logic in a way that guarantees that the original formula is provable in intuitionistic logic if and only if the translated formula is provable in linear logic. Using the Gödel–Gentzen negative translation, we can thus embed classical first-order logic into linear first-order logic.

==The resource interpretation==

Lafont (1993) first showed how intuitionistic linear logic can be explained as a logic of resources, so providing the logical language with access to formalisms that can be used for reasoning about resources within the logic itself, rather than, as in classical logic, by means of non-logical predicates and relations. Tony Hoare (1985)&#x27;s classic example of the vending machine can be used to illustrate this idea.

Suppose we represent having a candy bar by the atomic proposition , and having a dollar by . To state the fact that a dollar will buy you one candy bar, we might write the implication . But in ordinary (classical or intuitionistic) logic, from and one can conclude . So, ordinary logic leads us to believe that we can buy the candy bar and keep our dollar! Of course,
we can avoid this problem by using more sophisticated encodings, although typically such encodings suffer from the frame problem. However, the rejection of weakening and contraction allows linear logic to avoid this kind of spurious reasoning even with the &quot;naive&quot; rule. Rather than , we express the property of the vending machine as a &quot;linear&quot; implication . From and this fact, we can conclude , but &quot;not&quot; . In general, we can use the linear logic proposition to express the validity of transforming resource into resource .

Running with the example of the vending machine, consider the &quot;resource interpretations&quot; of the other multiplicative and additive connectives. (The exponentials provide the means to combine this resource interpretation with the usual notion of persistent logical truth.)

Multiplicative conjunction denotes simultaneous occurrence of resources, to be used as the consumer directs. For example, if you buy a stick of gum and a bottle of soft drink, then you are requesting . The constant 1 denotes the absence of any resource, and so functions as the unit of ⊗.

Additive conjunction represents alternative occurrence of resources, the choice of which the consumer controls. If in the vending machine there is a packet of chips, a candy bar, and a can of soft drink, each costing one dollar, then for that price you can buy exactly one of these products. Thus we write . We do &quot;not&quot; write , which would imply that one dollar suffices for buying all three products together. However, from , we can correctly deduce , where . The unit ⊤ of additive conjunction can be seen as a wastebasket for unneeded resources. For example, we can write to express that with three dollars you can get a candy bar and some other stuff, without being more specific (for example, chips and a drink, or $2, or $1 and chips, etc.).

Additive disjunction represents alternative occurrence of resources, the choice of which the machine controls. For example, suppose the vending machine permits gambling: insert a dollar and the machine may dispense a candy bar, a packet of chips, or a soft drink. We can express this situation as . The constant 0 represents a product that cannot be made, and thus serves as the unit of ⊕ (a machine that might produce or is as good as a machine that always produces because it will never succeed in producing a 0). So unlike above, we cannot deduce from this.

==Other proof systems==

===Proof nets===
Introduced by Jean-Yves Girard, proof nets have been created to avoid the &quot;bureaucracy&quot;, that is all the things that make two derivations different in the logical point of view, but not in a &quot;moral&quot; point of view.

For instance, these two proofs are &quot;morally&quot; identical:
The goal of proof nets is to make them identical by creating a graphical representation of them.

==Semantics==

===Algebraic semantics===
==Decidability/complexity of entailment==

The entailment relation in full CLL is undecidable. When considering fragments of
CLL, the decision problem has varying complexity:

* Multiplicative linear logic (MLL): only the multiplicative connectives. MLL entailment is NP-complete, even restricting to Horn clauses in the purely implicative fragment, or to atom-free formulas.
* Multiplicative-additive linear logic (MALL): only multiplicatives and additives (i.e., exponential-free). MALL entailment is PSPACE-complete.
* Multiplicative-exponential linear logic (MELL): only multiplicatives and exponentials. By reduction from the reachability problem for Petri nets, MELL entailment must be at least EXPSPACE-hard, although decidability itself has had the status of a longstanding open problem. In 2015, a proof of decidability was published in the journal &quot;Theoretical Computer Science&quot;, but was later shown to be erroneous.
* Affine linear logic (that is linear logic with weakening, an extension rather than a fragment) was shown to be decidable, in 1995.

==Variants==

Many variations of linear logic arise by further tinkering with the structural rules:

* Affine logic, which forbids contraction but allows global weakening (a decidable extension).
* Strict logic or relevant logic, which forbids weakening but allows global contraction.
* Non-commutative logic or ordered logic, which removes the rule of exchange, in addition to barring weakening and contraction. In ordered logic, linear implication divides further into left-implication and right-implication.

Different intuitionistic variants of linear logic have been considered. When based on a single-conclusion sequent calculus presentation, like in ILL (Intuitionistic Linear Logic), the connectives ⅋, ⊥, and ? are absent, and linear implication is treated as a primitive connective. In FILL (Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic) the connectives ⅋, ⊥, and ? are present, linear implication is a primitive connective and, similarly to what happens in intuitionistic logic, all connectives (except linear negation) are independent.
There are also first- and higher-order extensions of linear logic, whose formal development is somewhat standard (see first-order logic and higher-order logic).

<text>Leonard Patrick O&#x27;Connor Wibberley (9 April 1915 – 22 November 1983), who also published under the name Patrick O&#x27;Connor, among others, was an Irish author who spent most of his life in the United States. Wibberley, who published more than 100 books, is perhaps best known for five satirical novels about an imaginary country Grand Fenwick, particularly &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; (1955).

Wibberley&#x27;s adult and juvenile publications cut across the categories of fictional novels, history, and biography. He also wrote short stories (several published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;), plays and long verse poems. Some of his books are in series. Besides the &#x27;Mouse&#x27; series, as Leonard Holton, he created the 11-novel &#x27;Father Bredder&#x27; mystery series (basis of the television series &quot;Sarge&quot;) about &quot;a major figure in the clerical crime drama&quot;. Among his more than 50 juvenile books are (with Farrar, Straus and Giroux), a seven-volume &#x27;Treegate&#x27; series of historical fiction and a four-volume life of Thomas Jefferson. As Patrick O&#x27;Connor, he wrote the Black Tiger series on auto racing for young adults. Wibberley also is classified as a science fiction writer.

Throughout the decades, scenes and senses of the sea play important parts in both Wibberley&#x27;s fiction and nonfiction. A lifelong amateur violin player, Wibberley published three violin-themed books: a memoir, &quot;Ah, Julian!: A Memoir of Julian Brodetsky&quot; (1963); a detective novel in his Father Bredder series (as Leonard Holton), &quot;A Problem in Angels&quot; (1970); and a young adult novel, &quot;Guarneri: Story of a Genius&quot; (1974).

Three of his novels have been made into movies: &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; (1959), &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Hands of Cormac Joyce&quot; (1972).

==Biography==

In 1915, Leonard Wibberley was born in Dublin, the youngest of six children. His family moved to Cork and, until the age of eight, he was educated in the Irish language at Ring College, Waterford, Ireland. After moving to England, he attended Abbey House, Romsey, Hampshire and then Cardinal Vaughan&#x27;s Memorial School in London. His father, Thomas Wibberley, FRSA, Professor of Agricultural Research, University College, Cork (one of the three constituents of the National University of Ireland) and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, was an experimental agronomist. He wrote several books contending his methods and inventions would allow the UK, absent empire, to feed itself (see &quot;Farming on Factory Lines: continuous cropping for the large farmer&quot; [London, 1919]). In 1921, the elder Wibberley was made a Fellow of the Linnean Society.
Leonard&#x27;s second name, &quot;Patrick&quot;, was his confirmation name; his third, which he used as one of several pen names, was his matronymic, from his school-teacher mother, Sinaid O&#x27;Connor. On his father&#x27;s sudden death at age fifty in 1930, leaving a widow and six children, Wibberley was obliged to leave school and began a long career in newspapers, in London, as copy boy for the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot; (1931–32), then reporter for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; (1932–34) and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; (London, 1934–36), and was also assistant London editor for the &quot;Malayan Straits Times&quot; and the &quot;Singapore Free Press&quot;. He then emigrated to Trinidad, where he held several jobs, first, briefly, as editor of the Trinidad &quot;Evening News&quot; (1936), thereafter as an oilfield worker for Trinidad Leaseholds Ltd (1936–43), before immigrating to New York City in 1943. There he was initially employed by Walsh Kaiser Shipyards, but soon found important jobs in journalism again, as Cable Dispatch Editor for the &quot;Associated Press&quot; (New York City) during the war years of 1943–44 and New York Correspondent and Bureau Chief for the London &quot;Evening News&quot; (1944–46).

In 1947 Wibberley moved permanently to California, working in newspapers, first (1947) as city editor of the &quot;Turlock Daily Journal&quot;, then as editor of the &quot;Independent Journal,&quot; San Rafael (1947–1949), next as copy editor then reporter, for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (1950–1954). While working for the &quot;Times&quot; he began his novel-writing career. At age 37, he published his first novel,&quot;The King&#x27;s Beard&quot; (1952). Leaving the newspaper business, he settled permanently in Hermosa Beach, California, as a full-time author, publishing 100 more books, at a rate of at least one a year and averaging more than three. Many were with three publishers: Farrar, Straus and Giroux; William Morrow; Dodd, Mead and Company. The best-known of Wibberley&#x27;s books, &quot;The Mouse that Roared&quot;, was kept in print for some time by Bantam Books and then Four Walls Eight Windows. Fifty of his book publications are available as e-books.

==Personal life==
Wibberley took part in plays, did local radio readings and wrote a weekly syndicated column for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &#x27;The Wibberley Papers&#x27;. His writing activities included unpublished and uncompleted projects, such as an unfinished 1958 collaboration with his friend Rosalind Russell on a musical script adaptation from his &quot;McGillicuddy McGotham&quot;, titled &quot;Little Mac&quot; (note picture above). His two marriages, in Trinidad with Olga Morton-Gittens, and in California with Hazel Holton, produced seven children, including film writer Cormac Wibberley; six of the children were with Holton.

==Death==
Wibberley died of a heart attack in Santa Monica, California, aged 68, on 22 November 1983.

==Legacy==
Wibberley donated manuscripts and proofs of many of his works to The Leonard Wibberley Archive of the library collections of the University of Southern California, where they are available, but not online. An online listing, titled &quot;Finding Aid of the Leonard Wibberley papers 0172&quot;, has appeared at &quot;The Online Archive of California&quot;.

In 1993, Borgo Press published a posthumous book of his last short writings.

<text>Graflex was a manufacturer that gave its brand name to several camera models.

The company was founded as the Folmer and Schwing Manufacturing Company in New York City in 1887 by William F. Folmer and William E. Schwing as a metal working factory, manufacturing gas light fixtures, chandeliers, bicycles and eventually, cameras.

In 1909, it was acquired by George Eastman, and the company was moved to 12 Caledonia Avenue (later renamed Clarissa Street) in Rochester, New York in 1928. It operated as the Folmer &amp; Schwing Division of the Eastman Kodak Company.

In 1926, Kodak was forced to divest itself of the division, which was spun off forming a new company, the Folmer Graflex Corporation, which changed its name to Graflex Inc. in 1946. In 1956, it became a Division of the General Instrument Precision Company, and moved its offices to Pittsford, New York outside Rochester. In 1968, the company was sold to the Singer Corporation.

Graflex was known for the quintessential press camera, the Speed Graphic which was manufactured for over 60 years, and was used by most of the photojournalists in the first half of the 20th century.

==History==
William F. Folmer, an inventor, co-owned the Folmer and Schwing Manufacturing Company, founded in New York City as a gas lamp company. As the gas lamp market declined, the company expanded into other areas including bicycles and photographic equipment, leading to the release of the first Graflex camera in 1899. As the company&#x27;s success grew, it chose to focus on photography and dropped its other manufacturing lines, and in 1905 was acquired by George Eastman, in 1907 becoming the Folmer Graflex Division of Eastman Kodak. After a succession of name changes, it finally became simply &quot;Graflex, Inc.&quot; in 1945. Eastman Kodak made all of the Graflex cameras in their professional equipment manufacturing plant on Clarrisa street in Rochester NY. In 1926, as a result of violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (Comp. St. § 8820 et seq.) Kodak was forced to divest itself of its professional equipment division, which became Graflex Inc. This company existed under independent ownership until 1958, when the company was bought by the General Precision Equipment, which operated it as an independent division until 1968, when it was sold to the Singer Corporation, who also operated it as a division until 1973, when it was finally wrapped up and its tooling sold to the Toyo Corporation.

From 1912 to 1973 Graflex produced large format and medium format press cameras in film formats from to . They also produced rangefinder, SLR and TLR cameras in a variety of formats ranging from 35mm to .

The Rochester Folmer plant also manufactured the Century Studio Camera, which was marketed under both the Kodak and Graflex nameplates. However, because Graflex printed separate catalogs for its studio and portable offerings, many erroneously believe the Century Studios to have been manufactured elsewhere.

===Graflex Reflex cameras===
The first of the Graflex-branded cameras, released in 1898, was the Graflex camera, also known as the Graflex Reflex, or Graflex single lens reflex (SLR). This camera used the same swinging-mirror, through-the-lens viewing mechanism as modern single lens reflex cameras, introduced many decades later, and quickly became popular for sports and press photography in the early 20th century due largely to its use of a focal plane shutter. To produce shutter speeds fast enough to appear to freeze rapid motion, early Graflex cameras employed a cloth shutter with a narrow slit that quickly moved across the film plane, exposing only one small strip at any given moment in its travel. To set the shutter speed, the photographer wound the shutter spring to one of a series of calculated tensions using a key, and selected the slit width with another control. A table on the side of the box gave the shutter speed for each combination. The Graflex Reflex was also popular among early 20th Century fine art photographers, leading several lens manufacturers to design special soft-focus lenses, including the famous Wollensak&#x27;s Verito, to support the camera&#x27;s creative potential.
===Speed Graphic and Crown Graphic press cameras===
Graflex Speed Graphic folding cameras, produced from 1912 to 1973 also employed a focal plane shutter, but omitted the SLR swinging mirror and through-the lens viewing, replacing it by an external viewfinder, while retaining a view camera&#x27;s traditional ground glass for static subjects. This allowed the camera to be considerably lighter, and fold into a rugged boxy shape. These cameras could also be used with &quot;between-the-lens&quot; shutters mounted to the front lens board as more typically seen on large format cameras. The Speed Graphic became even more popular than the Graflex Reflex as a press and sports camera, so much so that to this type of classic press camera features in the masthead of the New York Daily News. The top-to-bottom motion of the focal plane shutter exposed the upper portion of the film first (i.e., the bottom of the inverted image as seen at the focal plane), so many photographs of automobile racing taken with Speed Graphics depicted the wheels of cars in an oval shape leaning forward. This feature was so ubiquitous in racing photography that it came to be a conventional graphical indication for speed, influencing many cartoonists who drew wheels in this same style to indicate fast motion.

Speed Graphics have also been used with success by many fine art photographers, as they work quite well with special un-shuttered lenses that were manufactured originally for the Graflex Reflex. Speed Graphics are still widely used by modern fine art photographers because of their unique image creation capabilities and simple, easily serviced mechanical design.

The Crown Graphic models of this same period were similar in overall design to the Speed Graphics, but omitted their focal plane shutter, allowing Crown Graphic models to be about one inch (2.5 cm) smaller and 1 pound lighter (.5 kg) Furthermore, their lack of a focal plane shutter allowed lenses to be mounted closer to the film plane, enabling the use of wider angle lenses on these models.

The company name changed several times over the years, as it was absorbed and released by the Kodak empire—finally becoming a division of the Singer Corporation. It dissolved in 1973. The Graflex plant in suburban Pittsford, New York still stands at 3750 Monroe Avenue, and was the corporate headquarters of Veramark Technologies from 1997 to 2010.

==Popular culture and today&#x27;s usage==

Because the Speed Graphic had its historical origins as the quintessential press camera prior to the advent of 35mm and digital photography for use by press photographers, some still consider the use of a Graflex obsolete. However, both the Speed Graphic and the Graflex SLR have focal plane shutters that allow use of large un-shuttered barrel lenses. These cameras are now being used by fine art photographers to make images that excel in depth of field control and image detail. As an example, a Kodak Aero Ektar 178 mm f/2.5 lens can be fitted to Speed Graphic 4x5 cameras and used to take soft/sharp photographs with complete control of the depth of focus.

The lightsaber prop used in the 1977 release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; was a modified 1940s Graflex 3-cell flashgun, which was designed to hold flash bulbs for vintage &quot;Speed Graphic&quot; cameras. The model of the flashgun used in the movie had the patent #2310165 stamped onto the bottom.

A stylized logo of a Speed Graphic camera appears on the flag of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;

<text>Mohawk Racetrack (renamed Woodbine Mohawk Park in 2018) is a harness racing track in Campbellville, Ontario. It is owned by Woodbine Entertainment Group (known as Ontario Jockey Club until 2001) and is about 40 km southwest of the company&#x27;s other racetrack, Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario. Woodbine Mohawk Park also has a large slot machine parlour with over 1,000 slot machines, which is operated by Great Canadian Entertainment; some of the revenue from this operation is used to increase the horseracing purses. Ken Middleton is the longtime track announcer.

==History==
The track was opened on April 26, 1963, by the then Ontario Jockey Club as Mohawk Racetrack, and 4,338 people attended. The 400-acre site was constructed at a cost of $3.5 million; it could house 828 horses in the barns and had enough parking for 3,000 cars. The very first Canadian Standardbred Horse Society Yearling Sale took place at the Woodbine Sales Arena, with 30 yearlings cataloged.

The Ontario Jockey Club changed its name to Woodbine Entertainment Group in 2001; in June 2017, Woodbine Entertainment Group announced an investment that would result in Mohawk being upgraded to accommodate year-round harness racing. Following the closure of Woodbine Racetrack&#x27;s harness track in early 2018 for conversion to a turf course for thoroughbred racing, Mohawk opened under the new brand name of Woodbine Mohawk Park.

Mohawk has frequently hosted the year-end Breeders Crown events, most recently in 2019.

==Track specifications==
The track is in circumference (originally ) and is made of crushed limestone. It can accommodate ten starters behind the gate. The homestretch is long, and the far turn has a larger radius than the clubhouse turn to encourage acceleration into the homestretch. There is no hubrail. Racing is usually on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Tuesday racing is held from June to early October. Post time is usually 7:10 PM. Some days have special post times.

==Races==
Some of the major stake&#x27;s races run at Mohawk include:

* Pepsi North America Cup for 3-year-old pacers, which carries a purse of and is Canada&#x27;s richest race for pacers. Mohawk hosted the event for the first time in 2007 when it was won by Tell All.
* The Mohawk Million, first run in 2020, is for 2-year-old trotters with a purse. Nine of the ten starting gate positions must be purchased in advance for each, which can then be sold, traded or leased before the race. The final starting gate slot goes to the winner of Mohawk&#x27;s William Wellwood Memorial.
* Metro Pace is a one-mile race for 2-year-old pacers. Known as a launching ground to greatness for horses such as Artsplace, Rocknroll Hanover, and Somebeachsomewhere. There is currently a tied race record of 1:49.2 for Captaintreacherous (2012) and Sportswriter (2009).
* Canadian Pacing Derby for Free For All pacers with an estimated purse of $600,000 and was first held in 1936.
* Canadian Trotting Classic is a one-mile race for 3-year-old trotters and is Canada&#x27;s richest race for trotters with a purse of $605,000. It has been won by many of the sport&#x27;s greatest trotters such as Father Patrick, Muscle Hill, Deweycheatumnhowe, and Kadabra. The race record is currently held by What The Hill at 1:51.4
* Maple Leaf Trot is a one-mile trotting event for horses of all-ages launched in 1950

<doc id="579707" wikidata="Q1032840" url="?curid=579707" title="SS Canberra">
<text>SS &quot;Canberra&quot; was an ocean liner, which later operated on cruises, in the P&amp;O fleet from 1961 to 1997. She was built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland at a cost of £17 million. The ship was named on 17 March 1958, after the federal capital of Australia, Canberra. She was launched on 16 March 1960, sponsored by Dame Pattie Menzies, wife of the then Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies. She entered service in May 1961, and made her maiden voyage starting in June. In the 1982 Falklands War she served as a troopship. In 1997 the singer and songwriter Gerard Kenny released the single &quot;Farewell Canberra&quot; which was specially composed for the last voyage.

==History==

=== Construction ===
P&amp;O had placed an order for plans for two new ocean liners, one with Harland and Wolff for £17 Million in 1956. On September 23, 1957, on Queen&#x27;s Island, Belfast, the first keel plates of yard no.1621 were laid on slipway 14. She had a gross tonnage of 45,733 GRT and dimensions of 819 feet by 103 feet. She was

Dame Pattie Menzies, wife of the Australian Prime Minister had been given the honor of christening the liner. &quot;Canberra&quot; left the slipway at Harland and Wolff&#x27;s Belfast shipyard on 17 March 1960, with the cheers from the dockers and shipyard workers, as well as 11,000 onlookers watching her leave. She began sea trials before taking up her maiden voyage in June 1961.

The SS Canberra was the last ocean liner built by Harland and Wolff shipyard. It was also the shipyard&#x27;s largest ship built since the White Star Line&#x27;s HMHS Britannic.

===Ocean liner===
P&amp;O commissioned &quot;Canberra&quot; to operate the combined P&amp;O–Orient Line service between the United Kingdom and Australasia and designed her to carry 548 first-class passengers and 1,650 tourist class. Too big for Tilbury she was based at Southampton. Her first voyage set out on 2 June 1961 through the Suez Canal and called at Colombo, Fremantle, Melbourne, Sydney, Auckland, Suva, Honolulu, San Francisco and Los Angeles returning to Southampton by the same ports. By mid-1963 she had spent many months in dry dock in Southampton and in the builder&#x27;s yard for repairs to her electrical and mechanical systems.

The era of mass air travel had begun by the time the &quot;Canberra&quot; was laid down and air travel prices fell relentlessly in the early 1960s to challenge P&amp;O&#x27;s lowest fares. In the second half of 1962 &quot;Canberra&quot; made a short cruise from Southampton followed by two more to New York. More cruises followed but nevertheless most of the ship&#x27;s first decade was spent on the Australia run.

===Cruises===

At the end of 1972 she was withdrawn and refitted to carry 1,500 single-class passengers on cruises. Unusually, this transition from an early life as a purpose-built ocean liner to a long and successful career in cruising, occurred without any major external alterations, and with only minimal internal and mechanical changes over the years. One of her public rooms included a &#x27;Cricketers Tavern&#x27;, which contained a collection of bats and ties from cricket clubs all over the world; she also had the &quot;William Fawcett&quot; reading/writing room, named for the first P&amp;O ship.

In 1961, while still a student at the Royal College in London, the now famous British artist David Hockney (born 1937) was commissioned to create a mural for the ‘Pop Inn’, a special lounge for teenagers onboard. Hockney graffitied and drew on the walls for five days and the fee earned assisted him to travel to New York for the first time.

===Engineering===
Like and that she replaced on the Tilbury–Brisbane route, &quot;Canberra&quot; had turbo-electric transmission. Instead of being mechanically coupled to her propeller shafts, &quot;Canberra&quot;″s steam turbines drove large electric alternators that provided current for electric motors that, in turn, drove the vessel&#x27;s twin propellers. They were the most powerful steam turbo-electric units ever installed in a passenger ship; at per shaft, they surpassed &#x27;s on each of her four shafts. This would give her a speed of about . She also had a bow propeller for manoeuvring in port and docking manoeuvres. She was also the first British passenger liner to use alternating current as power.

There are several operational and economical advantages to such electrical de-coupling of a ship&#x27;s propulsion system, and it became a standard element of cruise ship design in the 1990s, over 30 years after &quot;Canberra&quot; entered service. However, diesel engine- and gas turbine-driven alternators are the primary power source for most modern electrically propelled ships.

&quot;Canberra&quot; had a bulbous bow, two sets of stabilizers, and two funnels side-by-side. The lifeboats, which were made from glass fibre, were placed three decks lower than usual for ships of her type, and were recessed into the hull to allow improved view from the passenger decks.

The iconic spiral staircase and entrance halls in Australian walnut were designed by Hugh Casson and created by H.H. Martyn &amp; Co.

===Falklands War===

On 2 April 1982, the Argentinian military junta declared possession of the &quot;Islas Malvinas&quot; and invaded the British Falkland Islands. At the time, &quot;Canberra&quot; was cruising in the Mediterranean. The next day, her captain Dennis Scott-Masson received a message asking his time of arrival at Gibraltar, which was not on his itinerary. When he called at Gibraltar, he learnt that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had requisitioned &quot;Canberra&quot; for use as a troopship. &quot;Canberra&quot; sailed to Southampton, Hampshire where she was quickly refitted, sailing on 9 April for the South Atlantic.

Nicknamed the Great White Whale, &quot;Canberra&quot; proved vital in transporting 3 Commando Brigade to the islands more than from the United Kingdom. &quot;Canberra&quot; was sent to the heart of the conflict.

&quot;Canberra&quot; anchored in San Carlos Water on 21 May as part of the landings by British forces to retake the islands. Although her size and white colour made her an unmissable target for the Argentine Air Force, &quot;Canberra&quot;, if sunk, would not have been completely submerged in the shallow waters at San Carlos. However, the liner was not badly hit in the landings as the Argentine pilots tended to attack the warships instead of the supply and troop ships. After the war, Argentine pilots said they were told not to hit &quot;Canberra&quot;, as they mistook her for a hospital ship. Hospital ships must be painted white, as &quot;Canberra&quot; always had been, but must also fly a Red Cross flag.
&quot;Canberra&quot; then sailed to South Georgia, where 3,000 troops were transferred from &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;. They were landed at San Carlos on 2 June. When the war ended, &quot;Canberra&quot; was used as a cartel to repatriate captured Argentine soldiers, landing them at Puerto Madryn, before returning to Southampton to a rapturous welcome on 11 July. Captain Scott-Masson, who had started his apprenticeship on the Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line troopship in the late 1940s, was awarded a CBE and made an aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II.

===Final years===

After a lengthy refit, &quot;Canberra&quot; returned to civilian service as a cruise ship. Her role in the Falklands War made her very popular with the British public, and ticket sales after her return were elevated for many years as a result. In March 1986, the Golden Cockerel trophy was transferred from the old to the &quot;Canberra&quot; due to Oriana&#x27;s retirement. Age and high running costs eventually caught up with the &quot;Canberra&quot; though, as she had much higher fuel consumption than most modern cruise ships. As refitting her to meet the new 1997 SOLAS regulations would have been very expensive, P&amp;O opted to retire the old vessel.

On 25 June 1996 P&amp;O Cruises announced that the &quot;Canberra&quot; would be retired at the end of 1997. Although Premier Cruise Line had made a bid for the old ship, P&amp;O had already decided that they did not want &quot;Canberra&quot; to operate under a different flag and refused to sell her to Premier, as a result, Premier bought the similar looking . As a replacement for the &quot;Canberra&quot;, the 1988-built &quot;Star Princess&quot; was transferred to P&amp;O Cruises and was renamed &quot;Arcadia&quot;. On 25 September 1997 the Golden Cockerel trophy was transferred from &quot;Canberra&quot; to the new while both ships were docked at Cannes, France.

&quot;Canberra&quot; was withdrawn from P&amp;O service on 30 September 1997 and sold to ship breakers for scrapping on 10 October 1997, leaving for Gadani ship-breaking yard, Pakistan on 31 October 1997. Her deep draft meant that she could not be beached as far as most ships, and due to her solid construction the scrapping process took nearly a year instead of the estimated three months, being totally scrapped by the end of 1998.

== Canberra Bar ==
A bar, known as the &quot;Canberra Bar&quot;, was located at the corner of Scrabo Street and Station Street, in Queen&#x27;s Quay, Belfast. It served the nearby shipyard workers and dockers from the coal quay. A large glass mural picturing the SS &quot;Canberra&quot; was located behind the bar. Due to redevelopments in the area, the Canberra Bar was demolished in the 1990s.

<text>Brigadier Gerard (5 March 1968 – 29 October 1989) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a racing career which lasted from June 1970 until October 1972, he won seventeen of his eighteen races. The colt is rated the best racehorse trained in Britain in the 20th century.

Brigadier Gerard was unbeaten as a two-year-old in 1970, when his most important win came in the Middle Park Stakes. At three he was again unbeaten, defeating Mill Reef in a famous race for the 2000 Guineas and going on to win the St. James&#x27;s Palace Stakes, Sussex Stakes, Goodwood Mile and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over a mile, before moving up in distance to win the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs. As a four-year-old he won the Lockinge Stakes, Prince of Wales&#x27;s Stakes and Eclipse Stakes before moving up in distance to win the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over miles. Brigadier Gerard sustained his only defeat when beaten by Roberto in the inaugural running of the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup.

==Background==
Bred by John Hislop in England and foaled on 5 March 1968, Brigadier Gerard was a son of the stallion Queen&#x27;s Hussar, winner of the Sussex Stakes and the Lockinge Stakes, and the non-winning racemare, La Paiva, a daughter of Prince Chevalier. On his female side he traced back to the brilliant fillies&#x27; Triple Crown winner, Pretty Polly, who was his fifth dam. This beautifully balanced bay colt was named after Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s swashbuckling hero. Brigadier Gerard had good conformation, an excellent temperament and stood 16 hands 2 inches high.

Brigadier Gerard was trained during his racing career by Major Dick Hern and ridden in all his races by Joe Mercer.

==Racing career==

==1970: two-year-old season==

===Berkshire Stakes, Newbury===
Brigadier Gerard began his career as a two-year-old on 24 June 1970, in the Berkshire Stakes at Newbury. The race was run on good ground over five furlongs and attracted a field of five runners including three previous winners. Brigadier Gerard was ridden by Joe Mercer and was relatively unfancied at odds of 100/7.
In the race Mercer sat behind the more experienced runners until approaching the two furlong marker where, when he gave the Brigadier the office he strode eight to ten lengths clear before being allowed to ease down before the line for an easy five length success.
John Lawrence in the Daily Telegraph wrote: &quot;This was the big bay colts first race, but showing no sign of inexperience he proceeded to treat his opponents, including three previous winners, with total disrespect.&quot;

===Champagne Stakes, Salisbury===
So easy was this first success Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s owners decided to run him eight days later on 2 July in the Champagne Stakes, run over six furlongs at Salisbury. Carrying a penalty for his previous win Brigadier Gerard was favourite at 13 to 8 on. Another easy success, by 4 lengths, ensued.

===Washington Singer Stakes, Newbury===
Having had two races in quick succession Brigadier Gerard was given a six-week break before reappearing in the Washington Singer Stakes at Newbury on 15 August. Starting favourite at odds of 4/9 and carrying a penalty Brigadier Gerard led comfortably at the furlong marker winning by two lengths from Comedy Star.

===Middle Park Stakes, Newmarket===
Following three easy successes the Brigadier was now ready for his biggest test, the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket, run over six furlongs and for a value of £10,515 18s. The opposition included Mummy&#x27;s Pet, unbeaten in his three starts including the Hyperion Stakes and Norfolk Stakes, and Swing Easy, winner of three of his four starts including the New Stakes at Royal Ascot, July Stakes at Newmarket and the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood, his only defeat being at the hands of My Swallow in the Prix de la Salamandre at Longchamp. Mummy&#x27;s Pet started favourite at 6 to 5 on, Swing Easy was 9 to 4 with Brigadier Gerard at 11 to 2. 
After a slow early pace Joe Mercer allowed Brigadier Gerard to stride into the lead where he drew steadily clear winning easing down by three lengths from Mummy&#x27;s Pet with Swing Easy a further half a length away in third place.

Len Thomas, The Sporting Life wrote: &quot;Yesterday, in the Middle Park Stakes, the early pace was very slow for the first couple of furlongs but when Brigadier Gerard reached the incline he settled the issue in a few strides to win impressively. It was interesting to note Brigadier Gerard finished the same distance ahead of Swing Easy as did My Swallow in the Prix de la Salamandre at Longchamp recently&quot;.

Owner John Hislop wrote: &quot;It was a truly thrilling moment. To have won the Middle Park Stakes was a triumph in itself, but for the Brigadier to have slaughtered the opposition in this way was unbelievable. His right to contest the Two Thousand Guineas has been won with honours.&quot;

As three-year-olds Mummy&#x27;s Pet and Swing Easy remained at sprinting, where they proved themselves to be top class, winning, among other successes, the Sceptre Stakes, Temple Stakes, Daniel Prenn, King&#x27;s Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes.

==1971: three-year-old season==
===2000 Guineas Stakes, Newmarket===
The field of six runners for the season&#x27;s first colts&#x27; classic, the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, was one of the smallest in recent memory. However, the three colts that had headed the Free handicap, My Swallow, Mill Reef, and Brigadier Gerard, had between them won 18 of their 19 races, including every major two-year-old race in Europe. My Swallow, unbeaten in eight races as a two-year-old, including the four best races in France, and Mill Reef, winner of five of his six races as a two-year-old, including the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot, Gimcrack Stakes at York and Dewhurst Stakes at [Newmarket, had won their prep races, the Usher Stakes at Kempton Park and the Greenham Stakes at Newbury. Brigadier Gerard, as planned, arrived at the Rowley Mile without a preparatory race. 
The race was generally billed as a match between the 6/4 favourite Mill Reef and the 2/1 second favourite My Swallow. Brigadier Gerard was relatively overlooked at 11/2, Minsky, a full brother to Nijinsky and Irish champion 2-y-o in 1970 at 15/2, Good Bond at 16/1 and Indian Ruler the complete outsider at 100/1.

In the race My Swallow made the early running from Mill Reef until they came together, three furlongs from home. At this point neither, on Mill Reef, nor Frankie Durr, on My Swallow, had yet to ask their charges any serious questions. When Joe Mercer asked Brigadier Gerard to close the gap on the two leaders the response was immediate. With under three furlongs left to run, Brigadier Gerard drew alongside Mill Reef before striding away to win by a comfortable three lengths. My Swallow was 3/4 length back in third, Minsky finished fourth.

Mill Reef was not beaten again winning The Derby, Eclipse Stakes, King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe, Prix Ganay and Coronation Cup. He was retired to stud after suffering a serious leg injury on the gallops.

My Swallow ran twice more. He dropped back in distance to contest the Prix de la Porte Maillot at Longchamp finishing 2nd to top French miler Faraway Son. Then, just 11 days later, contested the July Cup at Newmarket where he was beaten narrowly by Realm. He was then retired to stud having won 9 of his 12 races in just under 14 months. 
Minsky, winner of four of his 7 races, went to North America where he won several races.

===St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes, Ascot===

The weather had been so bad it was questionable whether or not racing would go ahead on the first day of Royal Ascot. As the St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes was the last race on the card it would be run in the worst of the going. Only four runners were declared including the main danger Sparkler. Trained by Sam Armstrong and ridden by Lester Piggott. Sparkler was a very good two-year-old rated only 8lbs behind the very best of his age including My Swallow, Mill Reef and Brigadier Gerard. As a three-year-old he had won the Thirsk Classic Trial easily before being beaten, some thought unluckily and following a stewards enquiry, in the Irish 2000 Guineas. Sparkler had subsequently won the Diomed Stakes at Epsom. Good Bond, a long way behind Brigadier Gerard in the 2000 Guineas and Ballyhot, a maiden winner completed the four runner field. Brigadier Gerard started at odds of 4/11.

In the prevailing conditions the visibility was poor. Sparkler made the running until the two furlong marker where Joe Mercer brought Brigadier Gerard to challenge. Some viewers suggested the Brigadier hit a patch of false ground and lost 6 lengths. Mercer had picked him up and renewed his challenge eventually catching Sparkler only 25 yards from the line to win going away.
&quot;After the race, John Hislop confirmed that his plans for Brigadier Gerard depended, in part at least, on Mr David Robinson, owner of My Swallow. John Hislop had offered him the chance of revenge for his colts defeat in the 2000 Guineas if he ran his colt in the July Cup. When the offer was not accepted the decision was made to run Brigadier Gerard next in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood&quot; (John Lawrence, Daily Telegraph).

===Sussex Stakes, Goodwood===
Heavy rain on the Tuesday and plenty more in the hour before racing had made the going at Goodwood not as deep as Royal Ascot, but still considered to be much to the disadvantage of Brigadier Gerard. 
The four-year-olds were well represented. Leading the opposition was French challenger and soft-ground specialist Faraway Son who, as a three-year-old, had finished first but subsequently disqualified in the Poule d&#x27;Essai des Poulains (French 2000 Guineas) in favour of French horse Caro whose only defeat this season had been by Mill Reef in the Eclipse Stakes. Faraway Son had also just beaten the 2000 Guineas third, My Swallow by six lengths at xLongchamp. Joshua had won three times from his four starts with only a very narrow defeat in the Lockinge Stakes by top miler Welsh Pageant being his only blot on his season. 
The three-year-old division was also well represented by King&#x27;s Company and Ashleigh. King&#x27;s Company, the second highest rated two-year-old in Ireland had won the Irish 2000 Guineas in somewhat controversial circumstances, in course record time and by the narrowest of margins from Sparkler. He had, more recently, won the Cork and Orrery Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ashleigh, highly regarded by his trainer, Paddy Prendergast, had easily won the Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot on his only run this season.

As a result of prevailing conditions Joe Mercer allowed Brigadier Gerard to stroll along at the head of affairs until approaching the furlong maker, where Faraway Son and Joshua threw down their challenges. Brigadier Gerard pulled away to win easily by 5 lengths from Faraway Son, with the finishing time two seconds outside the course record.

Faraway Son was not beaten again. He next won the Prix du Rond Point (beating Poule d&#x27;Essai des Pouliches (French 1000 Guineas) winner Bold Fascinator), the Prix du Moulin de Longchamp, and the Prix de la Foret.

===Goodwood Mile, Goodwood===
A small field contested the Goodwood Mile run in damp, wintry conditions. Only two horses opposed Brigadier Gerard, Gold Rod and Ashleigh, resulting in the favourite&#x27;s cramped odds of 1/6.
In 1970 Gold Rod was extensively campaigned running 12 times and winning three including the Prix du Moulin de Longchamp. It took the very best milers in this country to prevent him from also winning the St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes, [Sussex Stakes and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.
Ashleigh, having his third run of the season had won the Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot easily before losing to Brigadier Gerard in the Sussex Stakes. 
In the race Brigadier Gerard made the running then quickened at the two-furlong mark to win very easily by 10 lengths. Gold Rod beat Ashleigh by four lengths for the runner-up spot.

===Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, Ascot===
Another small field contested this race run before a bumper cowd at Ascot. In opposition was leading French challenger Dictus, fourth in last season&#x27;s Champion Stakes just behind Nijinsky, and now fresh from victory in the Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville, where he defeated Sparkler by half a length. And to complete the three runners was Ashleigh whose two previous defeats were at the hands of Brigadier Gerard. 
Starting at odds of 2/11 Brigadier Gerard never saw another rival and was completely unchallenged throughout. He won very easily beating Dictus by eight lengths in near course record time.

===Champion Stakes, Newmarket===
Following Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s narrow success in the St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot it was with some trepidation that he lined up for his first attempt at ten furlongs in conditions rapidly approach those he encountered that day at Ascot. 
Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s owner had stated that they would never run him in such conditions as he had encountered at Ascot but with huge crowds turning up to watch him run they did not want to disappoint them. 
A field of ten contested the £35,000 prize. 
From Great Britain the leading older horses included Welsh Pageant who was having his fourth run of the season, winning the Lockinge Stakes and Hungerford Stakes and he had finished third in the Eclipse Stakes behind Mill Reef and Caro. Gold Rod was fresh from his win in the Prix La Coupe where he had exacted revenge on Amadou who had finished 5 lengths in front of him in the Prix Ganay. Great Wall (fourth to Nijinsky in the Epsom Derby), Leander (winner of the Prix Jean Prat at Chantilly as a three-year-old) and Tamil winner of a minor event at Deauville.

From France came Tratteggio, trained by Alec Head, having just won the Prix Henri Delamere by 6 lengths, Amadou who had run Caro, the best older horse in France, very close before being beaten narrowly by Gold Rod and Roi Soliel, a mud lover, who had won the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot before being narrowly defeated by Dictus and Gold Rod in the[Prix Jacques le Marois.

From Ireland came Rarity, trained by Paddy Prendergast and ridden by Pat Eddery. This lightly raced four-year-old had shown a distinct preference for soft ground. In his last race, the Desmond Stakes at the Curragh, he had easily beaten Lombardo by 4 lengths in similar conditions. Lombardo boasted Epsom Derby form having been beaten into 4th place at Epsom, 6 lengths behind Mill Reef, and was then beaten 3 lengths into 2nd place in the Irish Derby at the Curragh by the Epsom Derby third, Irish Ball.

The rain had continued throughout the day and the race itself was run in very poor visibility and in very soft underfoot conditions. 
In the race Welsh Pageant, Leander, Gold Rod and Roi Soleil were all in the leading group with Brigadier Gerard being ridden patiently behind them. 
As they entered the dip three furlongs from home Brigadier Gerard moved into the lead and pulled three lengths clear. On reaching the rising ground Rarity made progress on the outside where Brigadier Gerard held on to win by a short head with Welsh Pageant lengths away in third. 
After the race Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s owners declared they would not run Brigadier Gerard again in similar, testing, underfoot conditions.

The 1971 season ended with Brigadier Gerard maintaining his unbeaten record with 10 wins. He became the first English classic winner since Ormonde, who was foaled in 1883, to be unbeaten in 10 or more races. Mill Reef also remained unbeaten since their meeting in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. The scene was now set for a showdown between these two great champions in the 1972 Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park run over ten furlongs. It was advertised widely as the Race of the Century.

==1972: four-year-old season==

Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s four-year-old season began somewhat inauspiciously. 
With the main target being a renewed match with Mill Reef in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park on 8 July, a meeting widely publicised as ‘The race of the Century’, it was important that Brigadier Gerard gained experience of Sandown Park racecourse beforehand. For this reason the Brigadier&#x27;s provisional programme, planned by his owners John and Jean Hislop, was to start with the Coronation Stakes,run at Sandown Park, in April. He would then run in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury followed by the Prince of Wales Stakes at Royal Ascot before his date with destiny in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. Then, following a short break, he would run in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup, (now the International Stakes) at York, the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot before ending his amazing career with a repeat win in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket. 
In his book, &quot;The Brigadier&quot;, John Hislop wrote that everything was going according to plan and on schedule until the Brigadier was mistakenly withdrawn from the Coronation Stakes at Sandown Park, just before the four-day stage, because of the likely soft ground. As it happened the ground dried appreciable and the going was perfect on the day the race was run, however, the repercussions of this decision significantly undermined Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s pre-planned schedule. Starting his season a month later than originally planned resulted in him running in four top class races in just seven weeks and then, when the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes was added to the list, it became five top class races in a period of just nine weeks.

===Lockinge Stakes, Newbury===

On 20 May, on good ground, Brigadier Gerard made his first appearance of the season where a field of just five runners contested this Group 2 race run on the straight mile at Newbury. With a new introduction to his pre-arranged racing schedule, the Westbury Stakes at Sandown Park, requiring Brigadier Gerard to return to the racecourse in just nine days the instructions given to his jockey which were to win but be given as easy a race as was possible. 
Brigadier Gerard, who started at odds of 2/7, was accompanied to the start by older horses Gold Rod, level weights, who the Brigadier had beaten in their two previous meetings, and Leander, a useful handicapper who was in receipt of seven pounds for not winning a Group 1 race. Two three years olds, Grey Mirage and Crespinall, made up the five runners and were in receipt of 22lbs and 25lbs respectively. Grey Mirage had just won two classic trials easily, by wide margins, and had finished 8th in the Two Thousand Guineas at Newmarket. Crespinall had just won a Group 3 race at Epsom and subsequently won the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood. 
The race was uneventful. Crespinall made the running until Brigadier Gerard took over four furlongs from home to win pushed out. Grey Mirage finished lengths away in second, with Gold Rod a further eight lengths away in third.

===Westbury Stakes, Sandown Park===

On 29 May, Brigadier Gerard ran in the Group 3 Westbury Stakes at Sandown Park run over 10 furlongs, with a view to gaining experience of the Sandown Park racecourse prior to his long-awaited meeting with Mill Reef in the Eclipse Stakes on 8 July. And this was no easy task. Carrying 9st 10lbs he was set to give 10lbs to three of his rivals, Fair World, Pembroke Castle and Juggernaut and 14lbs to the fourth, Ballyhot. 
Timeform pointed out: &quot;The task he faced was a tough one and by our reckoning he was no certainty&quot;. 
Brigadier Gerard started at odds of 4/9. 
Ballyhot made the early running at a steady pace before quickening in the home straight where Brigadier Gerard moved into 2nd place and, running on well under hands and heels riding only, led inside the final furlong for a half-length success. 
Before the race Brian Taylor, Ballyhot&#x27;s jockey, had expressed the view that Brigadier Gerard could not give a stone to a horse as good as Ballyhot. Afterwards he remarked that race may have done Brigadier Gerard a lot of good but it won&#x27;t have done Ballyhot any good at all. In his next race Ballyhot finished third, in the Group 1 Prix d&#x27;Ispahan at Longchamp, behind Riverman. 
After the race owner was to John Hislop declared &quot;Having not been fully tuned up at home it was a relief to hear Joe Mercer express himself well satisfied with the Brigadier’s two preliminary races&quot;.

===Prince of Wales Stakes, Royal Ascot===

If preparations for Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s first two races of the season were ‘tricky’ they were about to take on a completely new dimension. 
Two days before the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Stakes, Joe Mercer was involved in a plane crash when travelling to Brussels. Mercer was thrown clear but returned to help rescue his fellow passengers, although the pilot was killed. Mercer had to pass a fitness test on the day of the race, with Jimmy Lindley standing by to replace him.

On 20 June, on good ground, facing six opponents and ridden by Joe Mercer, Brigadier Gerard lined up for the Group 2, Prince of Wales Stakes. 
Three older horses, Pembroke Castle, Prominent and Lord David, in receipt of 4lbs, 4lbs and 6lbs respectively and three three-year-olds Steel Pulse, Pardner and The Broker in receipt of 19lbs, 22lbs and 26lbs respectively, completed the line-up. 
With Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s only two previous runs over 10 furlongs finishing in narrow successes, albeit in unusual circumstances, it was important to see how he performed in better conditions.
When interviewed by John Trickett, Daily Express, jockey Geoff Baxter, riding front-runner Prominent confirmed, quite rightly, that he was intending to ensure Brigadier Gerard stayed the distance well. 
&quot;You can say I will be riding Prominent in the usual way&quot; he said. &quot;I will let him bowl along at his own pace. And if the Brigadier beats us you will know for sure that he genuinely gets the mile and a quarter”. 
Brigadier Gerard started at odds of 1/2f. 
True to his word Prominent made the running and led into the home straight with Brigadier Gerard two lengths behind him with Steel Pulse in third place. Unable to push out the Brigadier in his usual way it was here that Joe decided to give his mount one back-hander and the result was immediate. Bursting clear he stormed home in course record time to win by 5 lengths from Steel Pulse with Pembroke Castle finishing third.

Sadly, a week later and just ten days before the Eclipse Stakes, the race billed as the Race of the Century, Ian Balding, trainer of Mill Reef, declared that Mill Reef was suffering from the virus, and was withdrawn. 
On 30 August Mill Reef, one of the truly great racehorses of any generation, suffered a serious, life-threatening injury on the gallops, and never raced again.

===Eclipse Stakes, Sandown Park===

On 8 July, just 19 days after the Prince of Wales Stakes, Brigadier Gerard lined up for the Group 1 Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. As the race approached, following the defection of Mill Reef from the line-up and with the going at Sandown Park predicted as being on the fast side of good, odds of 1/10 were available. Then, on the Friday afternoon, it started raining heavily. 
Following the Champion Stakes at Newmarket Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s owners had stated that they would never race their horse again in similar conditions but, with so many tickets sold for this contest they decided to let him take his place. While all the time keeping a close eye on the fact that there was still the real possibility of meeting Mill Reef in the King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot two weeks later. 
As a result of the rain continuing to fall heavy the ground became so bad that only 27 runners stood their ground on the day&#x27;s card. The Eclipse Stakes had the biggest field of the day with just 6 runners.
Owner, John Hislop and trainer, Major Dick Hern walked the course before racing and advised jockey Joe Mercer to keep toward the centre of the course up the home straight. 
The five runners facing Brigadier Gerard included three older horses, Charladouce, Gold Rod and Lord David all carrying 9st 5lbs with two 3-year-olds Alonso and Home Guard carrying 8st 7lbs. 
Brigadier Gerard started at odds of 4/11.

Charladouce made the early running from Gold Rod with Brigadier Gerard in third place. At the two furlong marker Charladouce dropped away and the Brigadier took over with Lord David challenging, Gold Rod running on and Home Guard trying to come through with a late run. Brigadier Gerard slogged on through the rain followed by Gold Rod and Home Guard.
Joe took it as easily as possible on the Brigadier considering the prevailing conditions while bearing in mind that the King George was in only two weeks time and, with Mill Reef still among the entries, that was then planned as his next destination. 
The race took very little out of the Brigadier who, according to his trainer Dick Hern, only lost 8lbs.

After a couple of easy days it was confirmed by his connections that Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s next race would indeed be in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot where he would step up to 12 furlongs for the first time in his career.

===King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Ascot===

The King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes has always been a great race where the younger and older generations meet. The race had recently been won by three-year-olds Mill Reef and Nijinsky in receipt of 14lbs from their elders. Brigadier Gerard, in this weight-for-age clash would be conceding 14lbs to the three-year-olds.

On Saturday 21 July on good going following overnight rain Brigadier Gerard lined up for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. There were nine runners, four 4-year-olds and five 3-year-olds, and this was Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s fifth race in just nine weeks.

The first three in the betting had run 27 times, winning 26 and one second by a neck. The field was one of the best ever to contest this race and included five individual classic winners.
Parnell had run 12 times as a three-year-old, winning seven, including the Irish St Leger by four lengths. He had a good record at Ascot, running twice and winning easily on both occasions. First in the Queen&#x27;s Vase at Royal Ascot easily beating 19 opponents and next, this season, first time out winning the Rouge Dragon handicap, carrying 9st 13lbs, by 8 lengths in a canter. Also, this season, he had won the Prix Jean Prat at Longchamp before being beaten narrowly by Rock Roi in the Group 1 Prix du Cadran also at Longchamp.

From Italy, ridden by Lester Piggott was Gay Lussac. Unbeaten in 7 races in Italy, including winning the Derby Italiano in impressive fashion. Reports were that he was the best horse to come out of Italy since Ribot. 
From France the three-year-old Riverman, unbeaten in four races this season including the French 2000 Guineas. 
And Steel Pulse who had finished 5th in the Epsom Derby, after recently changing stables and who subsequently won the Irish Derby beating Scottish Rifle and the Irish 2000 Guineas winner Ballymore. 
Also included were Selhurst, unbeaten in three races this season, including the Hardwicke Stakes at Ascot, Sukawa, 2nd in the Group 1 Grand Prix de Paris, where he beat Our Mirage by five lengths. Our Mirage had just finished two lengths fourth in Roberto&#x27;s Epsom Derby. 
Fair World and Bog Road were outclassed. Brigadier Gerard started at odds of 8/13.

Drawn wide, in stall1, Brigadier Gerard remained on the outside of the field throughout to ensure a clear run in the home straight. Joe Mercer&#x27;s instructions were to challenge on entering the home straight and make his way home. Instructions which were followed to the letter.
The race was run at a strong pace set by Selhurst for over five furlongs where Parnell took over. Brigadier Gerard moved up behind Parnell before entering the home straight, where he challenged two furlongs out. Leading approaching the final furlong, Brigadier Gerard stayed on strongly for a comfortable success, missing Mill Reef&#x27;s course record by 0.3 second carrying 14lbs more. 
As a result of jockey Willie Carson switching Parnell in the closing stages, a steward&#x27;s enquiry was called. The head-on patrol film, used for the first time on a British racecourse, showed no interference occurred, there was always room for Parnell to challenge up the rails and the result was allowed to stand.

===Benson and Hedges Gold Cup, York===

This was the inaugural running of the Benson &amp; Hedges Gold Cup and its place now, among the top-class Group 1 races in England, is secure.

However, had owners John and Jean Hislop known that, 50 years after its inauguration, no colt, four years old and upwards, would win the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot then go on to win this race at York in the same year, they may have had serious reservations about running their horse in this race.
As a result of the possibility of rain forecast Brigadier Gerard was also entered to run in the Nunthorpe Stakes two days later, over 5 furlongs.

On Tuesday 15 August, on good fast ground just twenty-four days after winning the hugely competitive King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in near course record time and running in his sixth race in just 12 weeks, Brigadier Gerard lined up against four opponents. Mill Reef had been withdrawn a week earlier leaving his pacemaker Bright Beam and Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s old adversary Gold Rod to carry the colours of the older horses but they were outclassed. The first and second in the Epsom Derby, Roberto and Rheingold, represented the best of the three-year-old division and they were the main opposition to the 1/3 favourite. 
At home Brigadier Gerard appeared to have recovered well from his exertions at Ascot. He looked magnificent before the race and appeared to be in the best of form. This was the first and only time Brigadier Gerard had raced left-handed. 
Vincent O&#x27;Brien, Roberto&#x27;s trainer, had been having difficulty acquiring a jockey to ride him at York. His usual jockey Bill Williamson, who had been ‘jocked-off’ by Lester Piggott in the Epsom Derby had agreed to ride in Belgium that day and Lester Piggott had turned down the ride in favour of Rheingold, who had recently easily won the Group 1 Grand Prix de St Cloud. As a result, Vincent had asked Roberto&#x27;s owner John Galbraith for help, where it was agreed his American jockey Braulio Baeza, a Panamanian, would fly over for the ride. With York racecourse similar to the United States racecourses, flat and left-handed, it should hold no fears for this top-class jockey.
Roberto had beaten Rheingold by the narrowest of margins at Epsom where the general consensus was that, at anywhere else but Epsom, he would gain his revenge.

From the outset it was clear that Roberto&#x27;s jockey wanted to force the pace and when he was joined by Bright Beam the pair quickly opened up a six length gap to Rheingold, followed by Brigadier Gerard then Gold Rod. They remained in this order until the entrance to the home straight where Bright Beam ran wide and dropped away. Baeza now set Roberto alight while Brigadier Gerard had passed Rheingold and entered the long home straight about three lengths behind Roberto. Moving smoothly the Brigadier closed the gap on Roberto but on reaching his hind quarters he could make no further inroads and when they entered the final furlong Joe Mercer accepted his fate and eased his mount to finish three lengths behind Roberto. 
The race time was exceptional with both first and second easily beating the course record.
Gold Rod finished in third with Rheingold 4th. Brigadier Gerard was giving 11lbs (weight for age) to Roberto. 
Following the race Brigadier Gerard showed signs of carrying a mild virus but with the video tape showing that he had beaten Gold Rod by an exceptional 17 lengths into third place plus the very fast time suggested Brigadier Gerard must have run close to his best. 
Where Roberto found this performance from was a mystery to most observers although Vincent O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s assistant trainer, Michael Kauntze, rated him on a par with Nijinsky when on form, and Lester Piggott stated that &quot;he was a champion when things were in his favour&quot;. Roberto had weak knees and required a left-handed track to perform to his best. Although an exceptional 2-year-old he had never shown the York form before and despite producing a brilliant performance in the 1973 Coronation Cup at Epsom in record time, never quite matched it again. Vincent O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s official biographer noted, &quot;It was an electric performance. It was also in a different league to any race Roberto had run before, or would run after&quot;. Vincent suggested that Roberto&#x27;s improvement may have been down to the left-handed nature of York racecourse. Vincent O’Brien had briefed Baeza about Roberto, the other horses in the race and also about the track but left the tactics to the jockey. As Baeza reported later “Vincent O’Brien didn’t give me any instructions. He just said ‘you’re the rider, do what you think is best’, though he did say that if the pace was strong it would find out Brigadier Gerard in the last half-mile and he was right. Timeform stated that they were unable to give Roberto a rating for this race adding that, although he beat Brigadier Gerard fair and square in the Benson &amp; Hedges Gold Cup at York they were unable to rate Roberto in the same class as Brigadier Gerard.

What happened at York racecourse on Tuesday 15 August 1972 still remains to many one of horseracing&#x27;s greatest mysteries.

===Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, Ascot===

On 23 September, exactly weeks after his defeat at York Brigadier Gerard arrived at Ascot for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Having lost 22lbs and his fifteen race unbeaten record as a result of his journey to York the Brigadier, according to his owners, looked and moved better than he had all season. Indeed, their confidence is his ability was such that at Ascot they believed he would prove himself to be not merely back to form but better than ever. And no more effective way to do so would be by breaking the course record for Ascot&#x27;s Old Mile, which had stood for fifteen years. 
The Hislop&#x27;s had acquired Almagest earlier in the season as a lead horse for the Brigadier in his home work and to travel with him to the racecourse. This time he was entered to ensure the race was run at a suitable pace. 
Apart from Almagest two other runners were declared. These were old rival Sparkler, in receipt of 7lbs, who had run the Brigadier perilously close at level weights in the St James Palace Stakes over course and distance and the three-year-old Redundant fresh from carrying 9st 10lbs to an all the way victory at Sandown Park. A fast run race looked to be guaranteed.
Starting at odds of 4/11 the Brigadier started unusually sluggishly losing about three or four lengths and brought up the rear. Almagest made the early running at a strong pace but was a spent force after four furlongs where Redundant took over ahead of Sparkler, Brigadier Gerard and the weakening Almagest. Turning in Sparkler challenged Redundant on his outside with Brigadier sitting patiently in behind. As Sparkler took the lead approaching the final furlong Brigadier Gerard launched his final attack. In the final furlong he left Sparkler standing and drew well clear for a six-length success. The victory was emphatic with both the Brigadier and Sparkler beating the old course record.

Timeform in &#x27;Racehorses of 1972&#x27; summed up the finish eloquently. &quot;Mercer had to pull Brigadier Gerard round the two leaders to deliver a challenge about two furlongs out. Responding magnificently, Brigadier Gerard caught the new leader, Sparkler, in twenty strides and, pushed right out strode away in tremendous style to win by six lengths&quot;. Adding that Sparkler ran through the line without slackening his pace.
John Hislop in ‘The Brigadier’ was similarly delighted adding &quot;As usual, the Brigadier took about three strides to reach full momentum. As he attained it, he was coming into the last furlong and from there he left Sparkler standing, opening up an ever-increasing gap till, at the post, he was six lengths clear. It was a staggering performance&quot;.

===Champion Stakes, Newmarket===

On 14 October Brigadier Gerard lined up for his 8th top class race in just 21 weeks. His races were run over a range of distances between one mile and twelve furlongs and a range of goings between firm and heavy. And, according to his trainer Dick Hern he never missed a day&#x27;s work. 
Unlike the Champion Stakes the previous year where heavy rain had saturated the ground producing underfoot conditions not entirely of the Brigadier&#x27;s liking this time the elements were at their most acceptable. The sun came out and the day was warm and autumnal. 
Eight horses opposed the Brigadier including two three-year-old classic winners Riverman and Steel Pulse who were in receipt of 7lbs. Boreen, Lord David, Jimsun, Sol Argent and L’Apache fell just below Group 1 standard and the Brigadier&#x27;s stable companion Almagest made up the field.

The race was reasonably uneventful. Almagest set the pace for four furlongs where Steel Pulse took over followed by Brigadier Gerard. Approaching the final three furlongs Brigadier Gerard pulled his way to the front and quickly established a clear lead. Riverman, who had not run since being defeated by the Brigadier in the King George, 12 weeks previously, came out of the pack to chase the Brigadier and with Joe just keeping his mount up to his work closed to within a length and a half at the line. 
The result was never in any doubt allowing the Brigadier to end his career with his 17th win in 18 starts. He returned to the winner&#x27;s enclosure where he received a reception worthy of his greatness. And before he was led away a call for three cheers sounded across the course.

Brigadier Gerard&#x27;s achievements on the racecourse bear the closest scrutiny.
Unbeaten in fifteen starts over distances between 5 furlongs and 12 furlongs. Including Group 1 races between 6 furlongs and 12 furlongs. He beat outstanding horses including Mill Reef and Rheingold. He ran and won on ground ranging from firm to heavy, he broke course records and he carried penalties. Based upon 2020 figures Brigadier Gerard won 12 Group 1 races. 
Added to that John Skeaping the renowned sculptor with expert knowledge of equine anatomy pronounced him as the best-looking and most perfectly formed horse he had ever seen.

==Stud record==

Just over four weeks after his final, triumphant arrival at West Ilsley Stables Brigadier Gerard was loaded onto the horsebox for the return journey to the headquarters of British racing. This time the destination was Egerton Stud, Newmarket which lies within hailing distance of four of the Brigadier&#x27;s most memorable successes, the Middle Park Stakes, the 2000 Guineas and two Champion Stakes, all memorable in their own way. 
Whatever high hopes the syndicate who bought into Brigadier Gerard held the terms and conditions of using his services appeared to be a huge gamble and were strongly criticised in the racing press.

The terms and conditions were that only breeders that race their own produce could use his services and any stud that sells yearlings is barred. No-one can know how damaging these rules and conditions were to the Brigadier&#x27;s stud career with many claiming they were punitive, misguided and Canute-like.

Andrew Caulfield of The Sporting Life concluded &quot;Only four British and Irish stallions could claim as good a figure as Brigadier Gerard. These were Rainbow Quest, Sadler&#x27;s Wells, Kris and Caerleon. With his fertility failing, Brigadier Gerard was retired in 1987. Altogether he sired 320 foals which is less than Saddlers Wells sired in his first six crops&quot;.

Brigadier Gerard died in 1989 and his remains are interred in the gardens of the Swynford Hotel (formerly Swynford Paddocks), Six Mile Bottom, Newmarket. He appears in the fifth generation of 2015 US Triple Crown winner American Pharoah&#x27;s pedigree, via his son, General.
Perhaps Brigadier Gerard wasn&#x27;t such a failure after all but with only two Group 1 winners and a total of 25 stakes winners from 14 crops, he has to be regarded as a disappointing sire.

==Assessment and honours==
Brigadier Gerard was given an end-of-year Timeform rating of 141 in 1971, making him the equal highest rated horse of the year, alongside Mill Reef. He topped the Timeform ratings in 1972 with 144, the joint second highest figure at that time given for a flat racehorse, equal with Tudor Minstrel and one pound behind Sea Bird. The Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown is named in his honour. In the 1972 British Horse of the Year poll conducted by the Racegoers&#x27; Club, Brigadier Gerard polled all forty of the available votes, making him the first horse to be unanimously elected to the honour.

<text>Amabel Ethelreid Normand (November 9, 1893 – February 23, 1930), better known as Mabel Normand, was an American silent film actress, comedienne, director and screenwriter. She was a popular star and collaborator of Mack Sennett in their Keystone Studios films, and at the height of her career in the late 1910s and early 1920s had her own film studio and production company, the Mabel Normand Feature Film Company. On screen, she appeared in twelve successful films with Charlie Chaplin and seventeen with Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle, sometimes writing and directing (or co-writing and directing) films featuring Chaplin as her leading man.

Normand&#x27;s name was repeatedly linked with gun violence, including the 1922 murder of her friend, director William Desmond Taylor, and the non-fatal 1924 shooting of Courtland S. Dines by Normand&#x27;s chauffeur, Joe Kelly. After police interrogation, she was ruled out as a suspect in Taylor&#x27;s murder. Normand was a very heavy smoker who may have suffered lung cancer, and/or a recurrence of tuberculosis in 1923, which led to a decline in her health, an early retirement from films in 1926 and her death in 1930 at age 36.

==Early life and career==

Amabel Ethelreid Normand was born in New Brighton, New York (before it was incorporated into New York City as part of Staten Island) on November 9, 1893. She took her name from her father&#x27;s only sibling, who had died before her birth in 1892. Normand&#x27;s mother, Mary &quot;Minnie&quot; Drury, of Providence, Rhode Island, was of Irish heritage; while her father, Clodman &quot;Claude&quot; George Normand, was French Canadian, with his ancestral lineage dating back to Normandy in France and their surname originally being &quot;LeNormand&quot; or &quot;Le Normand&quot;.

For a short time at the start of her career, Normand worked for Vitagraph Studios in New York City for $25 per week, but Vitagraph founder Albert E. Smith admitted she was one of several actresses about whom he made a mistake in estimating their &quot;potential for future stardom.&quot; Normand&#x27;s intensely beguiling lead performance in the 1911 dramatic short film &quot;Her Awakening&quot;, directed by D. W. Griffith, drew her attention and led to her meeting director Mack Sennett while at Griffith&#x27;s Biograph Company. The two subsequently embarked on a chaotic relationship. Sennett later brought Normand to California when he founded Keystone Studios in 1912.
Normand appeared with Charlie Chaplin and Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle in many short films. She played a key role in starting Chaplin&#x27;s film career and acted as his leading lady and mentor in a string of films in 1914, collaborating with him as a director, co-director or co-writer. Chaplin had considerable initial difficulty adjusting to the demands of film acting, and his performance suffered for it. After his first film appearance in &quot;Making a Living&quot;, Sennett felt he had made a costly mistake. However, Normand persuaded Sennett to give Chaplin another chance, and she and Chaplin appeared together in a dozen subsequent films, almost always as a couple in the lead roles. At the start of 1914, Chaplin first played his Tramp character in &quot;Mabel&#x27;s Strange Predicament&quot;, although it wound up being the second Tramp film released; Normand directed Chaplin and herself in the film. Later that year, Normand starred with Chaplin and Marie Dressler in &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot;, the first feature-length comedy.

Normand is credited as being the first film star to receive a pie thrown in the face.
Normand opened her own film company in partnership with Sennett in 1916, based in Culver City, California. She lost the company in 1918 when its parent company, Triangle Film Corporation, experienced a massive shakeup which also had Sennett lose Keystone Studios and establish his own independent company. In 1918, as her relationship with Sennett came to an end, Normand signed a $3,500-per-week contract with Samuel Goldwyn. Around that same time, Normand allegedly had a miscarriage (or stillbirth) with Goldwyn&#x27;s child.

==Scandals==
===Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle trials===
Arbuckle, Normand&#x27;s co-star in many films, was the defendant in three widely publicized trials for manslaughter in the 1921 death of actress Virginia Rappe. Although Arbuckle was acquitted, the scandal damaged his career and his films were banned from exhibition for a short time. Since she had made some of her most notable works with him, much of Normand&#x27;s output was withheld from the public as a result. Arbuckle later returned to the screen as a director and actor, but did not attain his previous popularity despite being exonerated in court.

===William Desmond Taylor murder===
Director William Desmond Taylor formed a close relationship with Normand based on their shared interest in books. Author Robert Giroux claims that Taylor was deeply in love with Normand, who had originally approached him for help in dealing with an alleged cocaine dependency, and that Taylor met with federal prosecutors shortly before his death with an offer to assist them in filing charges against her drug dealers, theorizing that this meeting caused the dealers to hire a contract killer. According to Giroux, Normand suspected the reasons for Taylor&#x27;s murder but did not know the identity of the man who killed him. According to Kevin Brownlow and John Kobal in their book &quot;Hollywood: The Pioneers&quot;, the idea that Taylor was murdered by drug dealers was invented by Paramount Studios for publicity purposes.

On the night of his murder, February 1, 1922, Normand left Taylor&#x27;s bungalow at 7:45 pm in a happy mood, carrying a book he had lent her. They blew kisses to each other as her limousine drove away. Normand was the last person known to have seen Taylor alive. The Los Angeles Police Department subjected Normand to a grueling interrogation but ruled her out as a suspect. Most subsequent writers have done the same. However, Normand&#x27;s career had already slowed, and her reputation was tarnished. According to George Hopkins, who sat next to her at Taylor&#x27;s funeral, Normand wept inconsolably.

===The Dines shooting===
In 1924, Normand&#x27;s chauffeur Joe Kelly shot and wounded millionaire oil broker and amateur golfer Courtland S. Dines with her pistol. In response, several theaters pulled Normand&#x27;s films, which were also banned in Ohio by the state film censorship board. However, Dines was not fatally injured; he died of a heart attack in 1945, over two decades after the shooting.

== Later career and death ==

Normand continued making films and was signed by Hal Roach Studios in 1926 after discussions with director/producer F. Richard Jones, who had directed her at Keystone. At Roach, she made the films &quot;Raggedy Rose&quot;, &quot;The Nickel-Hopper&quot;, and &quot;One Hour Married&quot; (her last film), all co-written by Stan Laurel, and was directed by Leo McCarey in &quot;Should Men Walk Home?&quot; The films were released with extensive publicity support from the Hollywood community, including her friend Mary Pickford.

In 1926, she married actor Lew Cody, with whom she had appeared in &quot;Mickey&quot; in 1918. They lived separately in nearby houses in Beverly Hills. Normand&#x27;s health was in decline due to tuberculosis. After an extended stay in Pottenger Sanitorium, she died from pulmonary tuberculosis on February 23, 1930, in Monrovia, California, at the age of 36. She was interred as Mabel Normand-Cody at Calvary Cemetery, Los Angeles. The date of birth listed on her crypt is incorrect. Her mother was buried in the crypt above her crypt.

==Legacy==
Normand has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to motion pictures at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard.

Her film &quot;Mabel&#x27;s Blunder&quot; (1914) was added to the National Film Registry in December 2009.

In June 2010, the New Zealand Film Archive reported the discovery of a print of Normand&#x27;s film &quot;Won in a Closet&quot; (exhibited in New Zealand under its alternate title &quot;Won in a Cupboard&quot;), a short comedy previously believed lost. This film is a significant discovery, as Normand directed the film and starred in the lead role, displaying her talents on both sides of the camera.

==Cultural references==
* A nod to Normand&#x27;s celebrity in early Hollywood came through the name of a leading character in the 1950 film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, &quot;Norma Desmond&quot;, which has been cited as a combination of the names Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor. The film also frequently mentions Normand by name.
* Normand is mentioned during series 2 episode 1 of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; by ambitious housemaid Ethel Parks. Daisy Mason (née Robinson), the kitchen maid, inquires what she is reading and Ethel responds, &quot;&quot;Photoplay&quot; about Normand. She was nothing when she started, you know. Her father was a carpenter and they&#x27;d no money, and now she&#x27;s a shining film star.&quot;
* Singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks wrote a song about the actress titled &quot;Mabel Normand&quot;, which appears on her 2014 album &quot;24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault&quot;.

===Fictional portrayals===
The 1974 Broadway musical &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; (Michael Stewart and Jerry Herman) fictionalized the romance between Normand and Mack Sennett. Normand was played by Bernadette Peters and Robert Preston portrayed Sennett.

Normand is played by actress Marisa Tomei in the 1992 film &quot;Chaplin&quot; opposite Robert Downey, Jr. as Charles Chaplin; by Penelope Lagos in the first biopic about Normand&#x27;s life, a 35-minute dramatic short film entitled &quot;Madcap Mabel&quot; (2010); and by Morganne Picard in the motion picture &quot;Return to Babylon&quot; (2013).

In 2014, Normand was played on television by Andrea Deck in series 2, episode 8 of &quot;Mr Selfridge&quot; and by Kristina Thompson in the short film &quot;Mabel&#x27;s Dressing Room&quot;.

The character played by Alice Faye in &quot;Hollywood Cavalcade&quot; (1939) was reputed to have been based partly on Normand.

<text>David Bryan Rashbaum (born February 7, 1962) is an American musician, best known as the keyboard player for the rock band Bon Jovi, in which he also co-wrote songs and performed backing vocals. In 2018, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bon Jovi. He is also known for writing the music and co-writing the lyrics with Joe DiPietro for the musical &quot;Memphis&quot;, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Original Score.

==Early life==
David Bryan Rashbaum was born on February 7, 1962, in Perth Amboy, New Jersey and raised in Edison, New Jersey. His father, Eddie Rashbaum, played the trumpet. Bryan was raised Jewish. He attended elementary school at Clara Barton, where he played many instruments including violin, viola, trumpet and clarinet. He also attended Herbert Hoover Middle School, then J. P. Stevens High School, from which he graduated. Bryan began to learn piano at age seven and played keyboards for a band called &quot;Transition&quot; with bass player Steve Sileo and lead singer Mike Ziegel. He studied with Emery Hack, a professor at Juilliard, for thirteen years. Bryan briefly attended Rutgers University, but dropped out to attend Juilliard.

==Career==
===With Bon Jovi===

Bryan was the first Bon Jovi member to receive a call when Jon Bon Jovi learned that he had received a recording contract, and agreed to join the band. He chose his stage name when he grew tired of continually having to spell out his entire name. At the time, Bryan was attending Rutgers University and was studying Pre-Med with a 4.0 GPA. Bryan has played keyboards and sung on all of Bon Jovi&#x27;s albums, as well as some of the solo albums of Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora. Bryan has co-written the songs &quot;Love Lies&quot; and &quot;Breakout&quot; on Bon Jovi&#x27;s self-titled first album; &quot;Only Lonely,&quot; &quot;The Hardest Part Is the Night,&quot; and &quot;To the Fire&quot; on ; the hit &quot;In These Arms&quot; on &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;; and &quot;Last Cigarette&quot; on &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; (including the international bonus track &quot;Unbreakable&quot;) .

===Musical theater===
Bryan and Joe DiPietro wrote the music for the musical &quot;Memphis&quot;, for which the duo won the Tony Award for Best Original Score The musical had its off-Broadway debut in 2002. In 2008, &quot;Memphis&quot; was performed at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego. The show was also performed in January 2009 in Seattle, Washington, at the 5th Avenue Theatre, prior to moving to Broadway later in 2009. Memphis, which ran on Broadway from October 18, 2009, to August 5, 2012, was nominated for 8 Tony awards for the 2010 season and won 4 including Best Musical and Best Original Score.

Bryan also co-wrote the musical &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot;, again collaborating with Joe DiPietro. The musical made its off-Broadway premiere at New World Stages on April 6, 2009.

He has worked on a musical with DiPietro titled &quot;Chasing the Song&quot;, which chronicles American songwriters from 1962 to 1964 who worked in the Brill Building. Bryan describes it as &quot;a fictional story about factual America.&quot; Director Christopher Ashley and choreographer Sergio Trujillo are also involved. According to &quot;Playbill&quot;, &quot;A fall or early winter workshop of the musical is currently being planned. Broadway is the goal.&quot;

Their musical &quot;Diana&quot;, about Princess Diana, began previews on Broadway on March 2, 2020, with an anticipated opening date of March 31, following a tryout production at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, CA the previous year. The Broadway opening was delayed until December 16, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing of all Broadway theaters. The musical was then filmed that summer with no audience at the Longacre Theater, with the film being released on Netflix on October 1, 2021.

==Personal life==
Bryan was married to April McLean from 1990 to 2004. They have three children; twins Gabby Luna and Colton Moon Bryan born in 1994, and Artie Bryan (Tyger Lily) born in 2000. In 2010, he married his second wife Lexi Quaas (b. 1970) in Colts Neck, NJ.

==Charity work==
Bryan is very active in VH-1&#x27;s &quot;Save the Music&quot; program, as well as Only Make Believe. He also wrote the anthem for Only Make Believe, &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;, with Dena Hammerstein. He is an honorary Board member for Only Make Believe, a non-profit organization that brings interactive theater to chronically ill and disabled children in hospitals and care facilities. He is also a board member of Damon Marks&#x27; Traveling Guitar Foundation.

The band has built several homes for victims of Hurricane Katrina. The video for the hit song &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot; is a documentary of the making of these homes. The band also gave Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Angel Network one million dollars. With this, she created Bon Jovi Boulevard in Louisiana. Bon Jovi was welcomed back, one year later, to see Bon Jovi Boulevard, and to unveil it to its future residents.

<text>A data center is a building, a dedicated space within a building, or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.

Since IT operations are crucial for business continuity, it generally includes redundant or backup components and infrastructure for power supply, data communication connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, fire suppression), and various security devices. A large data center is an industrial-scale operation using as much electricity as a medium town. Estimated global data center electricity consumption in 2022 was 240–340 TWh, or roughly 1–1.3% of global electricity demand. This excludes energy used for cryptocurrency mining, which was estimated to be around 110 TWh in 2022, or another 0.4% of global electricity demand. The IEA projects that data center electric use could double between 2022 and 2026. High demand for electricity from data centers, including by cryptomining and artificial intelligence, has also increased strain on local electric grids and increased electricity prices in some markets.

Data centers can vary widely in terms of size, power requirements, redundancy, and overall structure. Four common categories used to segment types of data centers are onsite data centers, colocation facilities, hyperscale data centers, and edge data centers.

==History==

Data centers have their roots in the huge computer rooms of the 1940s, typified by ENIAC, one of the earliest examples of a data center. Early computer systems, complex to operate and maintain, required a special environment in which to operate. Many cables were necessary to connect all the components, and methods to accommodate and organize these were devised such as standard racks to mount equipment, raised floors, and cable trays (installed overhead or under the elevated floor). A single mainframe required a great deal of power and had to be cooled to avoid overheating. Security became important – computers were expensive, and were often used for military purposes. Basic design guidelines for controlling access to the computer room were therefore devised.

During the microcomputer industry boom of the 1980s, users started to deploy computers everywhere, in many cases with little or no care about operating requirements. However, as information technology (IT) operations started to grow in complexity, organizations grew aware of the need to control IT resources. The availability of inexpensive networking equipment, coupled with new standards for the network structured cabling, made it possible to use a hierarchical design that put the servers in a specific room inside the company. The use of the term &quot;data center&quot;, as applied to specially designed computer rooms, started to gain popular recognition about this time.

A boom of data centers came during the dot-com bubble of 1997–2000. Companies needed fast Internet connectivity and non-stop operation to deploy systems and to establish a presence on the Internet. Installing such equipment was not viable for many smaller companies. Many companies started building very large facilities, called internet data centers (IDCs), which provide enhanced capabilities, such as crossover backup: &quot;If a Bell Atlantic line is cut, we can transfer them to ... to minimize the time of outage.&quot;

The term cloud data centers (CDCs) has been used. Increasingly, the division of these terms has almost disappeared and they are being integrated into the term &quot;data center&quot;.

The global data center market saw steady growth in the 2010s, with a notable acceleration in the latter half of the decade. According to Gartner, worldwide data center infrastructure spending reached $200 billion in 2021, representing a 6% increase from 2020 despite the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The latter part of the 2010s and early 2020s saw a significant shift towards AI and machine learning applications, generating a global boom for more powerful and efficient data center infrastructure. As of March 2021, global data creation was projected to grow to more than 180 zettabytes by 2025, up from 64.2 zettabytes in 2020.

The United States is currently the foremost leader in data center infrastructure, hosting 5,381 data centers as of March 2024, the highest number of any country worldwide. According to global consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co., U.S. market demand is expected to double to 35 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, up from 17 GW in 2022. As of 2023, the U.S. accounts for roughly 40 percent of the global market.

A study published by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in May 2024 estimates U.S. data center power consumption could range from 4.6% to 9.1% of the country’s generation by 2030. As of 2023, about 80% of U.S. data center load was concentrated in 15 states, led by Virginia and Texas.

==Requirements for modern data centers==

Modernization and data center transformation enhances performance and energy efficiency.

Information security is also a concern, and for this reason, a data center has to offer a secure environment that minimizes the chances of a security breach. A data center must, therefore, keep high standards for assuring the integrity and functionality of its hosted computer environment.

Industry research company International Data Corporation (IDC) puts the average age of a data center at nine years old. Gartner, another research company, says data centers older than seven years are obsolete. The growth in data (163 zettabytes by 2025) is one factor driving the need for data centers to modernize.

Focus on modernization is not new: concern about obsolete equipment was decried in 2007, and in 2011 Uptime Institute was concerned about the age of the equipment therein. By 2018 concern had shifted once again, this time to the age of the staff: &quot;data center staff are aging faster than the equipment.&quot;

===Meeting standards for data centers===
The Telecommunications Industry Association&#x27;s Telecommunications Infrastructure Standard for Data Centers specifies the minimum requirements for telecommunications infrastructure of data centers and computer rooms including single tenant enterprise data centers and multi-tenant Internet hosting data centers. The topology proposed in this document is intended to be applicable to any size data center.

Telcordia GR-3160, &quot;NEBS Requirements for Telecommunications Data Center Equipment and Spaces&quot;, provides guidelines for data center spaces within telecommunications networks, and environmental requirements for the equipment intended for installation in those spaces. These criteria were developed jointly by Telcordia and industry representatives. They may be applied to data center spaces housing data processing or Information Technology (IT) equipment. The equipment may be used to:
* Operate and manage a carrier&#x27;s telecommunication network
* Provide data center based applications directly to the carrier&#x27;s customers
* Provide hosted applications for a third party to provide services to their customers
* Provide a combination of these and similar data center applications

===Data center transformation===
Data center transformation takes a step-by-step approach through integrated projects carried out over time. This differs from a traditional method of data center upgrades that takes a serial and siloed approach. The typical projects within a data center transformation initiative include standardization/consolidation, virtualization, automation and security.
* Standardization/consolidation: Reducing the number of data centers and avoiding &quot;server sprawl&quot; (both physical and virtual) often includes replacing aging data center equipment, and is aided by standardization.
* Virtualization: Lowers capital and operational expenses, reduces energy consumption. Virtualized desktops can be hosted in data centers and rented out on a subscription basis. Investment bank Lazard Capital Markets estimated in 2008 that 48 percent of enterprise operations will be virtualized by 2012. Gartner views virtualization as a catalyst for modernization.
* Automating: Automating tasks such as provisioning, configuration, patching, release management, and compliance is needed, not just when facing fewer skilled IT workers.
* Securing: Protection of virtual systems is integrated with the existing security of physical infrastructures.

=== Raised floor ===
A raised floor standards guide named GR-2930 was developed by Telcordia Technologies, a subsidiary of Ericsson.

Although the first raised floor computer room was made by IBM in 1956, and they&#x27;ve &quot;been around since the 1960s&quot;, it was the 1970s that made it more common for computer centers to thereby allow cool air to circulate more efficiently.

The first purpose of the raised floor was to allow access for wiring.

===Lights out===
The &quot;lights-out&quot; data center, also known as a darkened or a dark data center, is a data center that, ideally, has all but eliminated the need for direct access by personnel, except under extraordinary circumstances. Because of the lack of need for staff to enter the data center, it can be operated without lighting. All of the devices are accessed and managed by remote systems, with automation programs used to perform unattended operations. In addition to the energy savings, reduction in staffing costs and the ability to locate the site further from population centers, implementing a lights-out data center reduces the threat of malicious attacks upon the infrastructure.

=== Noise levels ===
Generally speaking, local authorities prefer noise levels at data centers to be &quot;10 dB below the existing night-time background noise level at the nearest residence.&quot;

OSHA regulations require monitoring of noise levels inside data centers if noise exceeds 85 decibels. The average noise level in server areas of a data center may reach as high as 92-96 dB(A).

Residents living near data centers have described the sound as &quot;a high-pitched whirring noise 24/7&quot;, saying “It’s like being on a tarmac with an airplane engine running constantly ... Except that the airplane keeps idling and never leaves.”

External sources of noise include HVAC equipment and energy generators.

==Data center design==
The field of data center design has been growing for decades in various directions, including new construction big and small along with the creative re-use of existing facilities, like abandoned retail space, old salt mines and war-era bunkers.
* a 65-story data center has already been proposed
* the number of data centers as of 2016 had grown beyond 3 million USA-wide, and more than triple that number worldwide

Local building codes may govern the minimum ceiling heights and other parameters. Some of the considerations in the design of data centers are:

* Size - one room of a building, one or more floors, or an entire building, 
* Capacity - can hold up to or past 1,000 servers
* Other considerations - Space, power, cooling, and costs in the data center. 
* Mechanical engineering infrastructure - heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); humidification and dehumidification equipment; pressurization.
* Electrical engineering infrastructure design - utility service planning; distribution, switching and bypass from power sources; uninterruptible power source (UPS) systems; and more.
===Design criteria and trade-offs===
* Availability expectations: The costs of avoiding downtime should not exceed the cost of the downtime itself
* Site selection: Location factors include proximity to power grids, telecommunications infrastructure, networking services, transportation lines and emergency services. Other considerations should include flight paths, neighboring power drains, geological risks, and climate (associated with cooling costs).
** Often, power availability is the hardest to change.

====High availability====

Various metrics exist for measuring the data-availability that results from data-center availability beyond 95% uptime, with the top of the scale counting how many &quot;nines&quot; can be placed after &quot;99%&quot;.

====Modularity and flexibility====

Modularity and flexibility are key elements in allowing for a data center to grow and change over time. Data center modules are pre-engineered, standardized building blocks that can be easily configured and moved as needed.

A modular data center may consist of data center equipment contained within shipping containers or similar portable containers. Components of the data center can be prefabricated and standardized which facilitates moving if needed.

===Environmental control===
Temperature and humidity are controlled via:
* Air conditioning
* indirect cooling, such as using outside air, Indirect Evaporative Cooling (IDEC) units, and also using sea water.

It is important that computers do not get humid or overheat, as high humidity can lead to dust clogging the fans, which leads to overheat, or can cause components to malfunction, ruining the board and running a fire hazard. Overheat can cause components, usually the silicon or copper of the wires or circuits to melt, causing connections to loosen, causing fire hazards. 

===Electrical power===

Backup power consists of one or more uninterruptible power supplies, battery banks, and/or diesel / gas turbine generators.

To prevent single points of failure, all elements of the electrical systems, including backup systems, are typically given redundant copies, and critical servers are connected to both the &quot;A-side&quot; and &quot;B-side&quot; power feeds. This arrangement is often made to achieve N+1 redundancy in the systems. Static transfer switches are sometimes used to ensure instantaneous switchover from one supply to the other in the event of a power failure.

===Low-voltage cable routing===
Options include:
* Data cabling can be routed through overhead cable trays
* Raised floor cabling, both for security reasons and to avoid the extra cost of cooling systems over the racks.
* Smaller/less expensive data centers may use anti-static tiles instead for a flooring surface.

===Air flow===
Air flow management addresses the need to improve data center computer cooling efficiency by preventing the recirculation of hot air exhausted from IT equipment and reducing bypass airflow. There are several methods of separating hot and cold airstreams, such as hot/cold aisle containment and in-row cooling units.

====Aisle containment====
Cold aisle containment is done by exposing the rear of equipment racks, while the fronts of the servers are enclosed with doors and covers. This is similar to how large-scale food companies refrigerate and store their products.
Computer cabinets/Server farms are often organized for containment of hot/cold aisles. Proper air duct placement prevents the cold and hot air from mixing. Rows of cabinets are paired to face each other so that the cool and hot air intakes and exhausts don&#x27;t mix air, which would severely reduce cooling efficiency.

Alternatively, a range of underfloor panels can create efficient cold air pathways directed to the raised-floor vented tiles. Either the cold aisle or the hot aisle can be contained.

Another option is fitting cabinets with vertical exhaust duct chimneys. Hot exhaust pipes/vents/ducts can direct the air into a Plenum space above a Dropped ceiling and back to the cooling units or to outside vents. With this configuration, traditional hot/cold aisle configuration is not a requirement.

===Fire protection===

Data centers feature fire protection systems, including passive and Active Design elements, as well as implementation of fire prevention programs in operations. Smoke detectors are usually installed to provide early warning of a fire at its incipient stage.

Although the main room usually does not allow Wet Pipe-based Systems due to the fragile nature of Circuit-boards, there still exist systems that can be used in the rest of the facility or in cold/hot aisle air circulation systems that are closed systems, such as:
* Sprinkler systems 
* Misting, using high pressure to create extremely small water droplets, which can be used in sensitive rooms due to the nature of the droplets.
However, there also exist other means to put out fires, especially in Sensitive areas, usually using Gaseous fire suppression, of which Halon gas was the most popular, until the negative effects of producing and using it were discovered.

===Security===

Physical access is usually restricted. Layered security often starts with fencing, bollards and mantraps. Video camera surveillance and permanent security guards are almost always present if the data center is large or contains sensitive information. Fingerprint recognition mantraps are starting to be commonplace.

Logging access is required by some data protection regulations; some organizations tightly link this to access control systems. Multiple log entries can occur at the main entrance, entrances to internal rooms, and at equipment cabinets. Access control at cabinets can be integrated with intelligent power distribution units, so that locks are networked through the same appliance.

==Energy use==

Energy use is a central issue for data centers. Power draw ranges from a few kW for a rack of servers in a closet to several tens of MW for large facilities. Some facilities have power densities more than 100 times that of a typical office building. For higher power density facilities, electricity costs are a dominant operating expense and account for over 10% of the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a data center.

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
In 2020, data centers (excluding cryptocurrency mining) and data transmission each used about 1% of world electricity. Although some of this electricity was low carbon, the IEA called for more &quot;government and industry efforts on energy efficiency, renewables procurement and RD&amp;D&quot;, as some data centers still use electricity generated by fossil fuels. They also said that lifecycle emissions should be considered, that is including &quot;embodied&quot; emissions, such as in buildings. Data centers are estimated to have been responsible for 0.5% of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. Some Chinese companies, such as Tencent, have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030, while others such as Alibaba have been criticized by Greenpeace for not committing to become carbon neutral. Google and Microsoft now each consume more power than some fairly big countries, surpassing the consumption of more than 100 countries.

===Energy efficiency and overhead===
The most commonly used energy efficiency metric for data centers is power usage effectiveness (PUE), calculated as the ratio of total power entering the data center divided by the power used by IT equipment.

:formula_1

PUE measures the percentage of power used by overhead devices (cooling, lighting, etc.). The average USA data center has a PUE of 2.0, meaning two watts of total power (overhead + IT equipment) for every watt delivered to IT equipment. State-of-the-art data centers are estimated to have a PUE of roughly 1.2. Google publishes quarterly efficiency metrics from its data centers in operation. PUEs of as low as 1.01 have been achieved with two phase immersion cooling.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has an Energy Star rating for standalone or large data centers. To qualify for the ecolabel, a data center must be within the top quartile in energy efficiency of all reported facilities. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 (United States) requires federal facilities — including data centers — to operate more efficiently. California&#x27;s Title 24 (2014) of the California Code of Regulations mandates that every newly constructed data center must have some form of airflow containment in place to optimize energy efficiency.

The European Union also has a similar initiative: EU Code of Conduct for Data Centres.

===Energy use analysis and projects===
The focus of measuring and analyzing energy use goes beyond what is used by IT equipment; facility support hardware such as chillers and fans also use energy.

In 2011, server racks in data centers were designed for more than 25 kW and the typical server was estimated to waste about 30% of the electricity it consumed. The energy demand for information storage systems is also rising. A high-availability data center is estimated to have a 1 megawatt (MW) demand and consume $20,000,000 in electricity over its lifetime, with cooling representing 35% to 45% of the data center&#x27;s total cost of ownership. Calculations show that in two years, the cost of powering and cooling a server could be equal to the cost of purchasing the server hardware. Research in 2018 has shown that a substantial amount of energy could still be conserved by optimizing IT refresh rates and increasing server utilization.

In 2011, Facebook, Rackspace and others founded the Open Compute Project (OCP) to develop and publish open standards for greener data center computing technologies. As part of the project, Facebook published the designs of its server, which it had built for its first dedicated data center in Prineville. Making servers taller left space for more effective heat sinks and enabled the use of fans that moved more air with less energy. By not buying commercial off-the-shelf servers, energy consumption due to unnecessary expansion slots on the motherboard and unneeded components, such as a graphics card, was also saved. In 2016, Google joined the project and published the designs of its 48V DC shallow data center rack. This design had long been part of Google data centers. By eliminating the multiple transformers usually deployed in data centers, Google had achieved a 30% increase in energy efficiency. In 2017, sales for data center hardware built to OCP designs topped $1.2 billion and are expected to reach $6 billion by 2021.

===Power and cooling analysis===

Power is the largest recurring cost to the user of a data center. Cooling it at or below wastes money and energy. Furthermore, overcooling equipment in environments with a high relative humidity can expose equipment to a high amount of moisture that facilitates the growth of salt deposits on conductive filaments in the circuitry.

A power and cooling analysis, also referred to as a thermal assessment, measures the relative temperatures in specific areas as well as the capacity of the cooling systems to handle specific ambient temperatures. A power and cooling analysis can help to identify hot spots, over-cooled areas that can handle greater power use density, the breakpoint of equipment loading, the effectiveness of a raised-floor strategy, and optimal equipment positioning (such as AC units) to balance temperatures across the data center. Power cooling density is a measure of how much square footage the center can cool at maximum capacity. The cooling of data centers is the second largest power consumer after servers. The cooling energy varies from 10% of the total energy consumption in the most efficient data centers and goes up to 45% in standard air-cooled data centers.

===Energy efficiency analysis===
An energy efficiency analysis measures the energy use of data center IT and facilities equipment. A typical energy efficiency analysis measures factors such as a data center&#x27;s Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) against industry standards, identifies mechanical and electrical sources of inefficiency, and identifies air-management metrics. However, the limitation of most current metrics and approaches is that they do not include IT in the analysis. Case studies have shown that by addressing energy efficiency holistically in a data center, major efficiencies can be achieved that are not possible otherwise.

===Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis===
This type of analysis uses sophisticated tools and techniques to understand the unique thermal conditions present in each data center—predicting the temperature, airflow, and pressure behavior of a data center to assess performance and energy consumption, using numerical modeling. By predicting the effects of these environmental conditions, CFD analysis of a data center can be used to predict the impact of high-density racks mixed with low-density racks and the onward impact on cooling resources, poor infrastructure management practices, and AC failure or AC shutdown for scheduled maintenance.

===Thermal zone mapping===
Thermal zone mapping uses sensors and computer modeling to create a three-dimensional image of the hot and cool zones in a data center.

This information can help to identify optimal positioning of data center equipment. For example, critical servers might be placed in a cool zone that is serviced by redundant AC units.

===Green data centers===
Data centers use a lot of power, consumed by two main usages: The power required to run the actual equipment and then the power required to cool the equipment. Power efficiency reduces the first category.

Cooling cost reduction through natural means includes location decisions: When the focus is avoiding good fiber connectivity, power grid connections, and people concentrations to manage the equipment, a data center can be miles away from the users. Mass data centers like Google or Facebook don&#x27;t need to be near population centers. Arctic locations that can use outside air, which provides cooling, are becoming more popular.

Renewable electricity sources are another plus. Thus countries with favorable conditions, such as Canada, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland are trying to attract cloud computing data centers.

Singapore lifted a three-year ban on new data centers in April 2022. A major data center hub for the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore lifted its moratorium on new data center projects in 2022, granting 4 new projects, but rejecting more than 16 data center applications from over 20 new data centers applications received. Singapore&#x27;s new data centers shall meet very strict green technology criteria including &quot;Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) of 2.0/MWh, Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of less than 1.3, and have a &quot;Platinum certification under Singapore&#x27;s BCA-IMDA Green Mark for New Data Centre&quot; criteria that clearly addressed decarbonization and use of hydrogen cells or solar panels.

====Direct current data centers====

Direct current data centers are data centers that produce direct current on site with solar panels and store the electricity on site in a battery storage power station. Computers run on direct current and the need for inverting the AC power from the grid would be eliminated. The data center site could still use AC power as a grid-as-a-backup solution. DC data centers could be 10% more efficient and use less floor space for inverting components.

===Energy reuse===
It is very difficult to reuse the heat which comes from air-cooled data centers. For this reason, data center infrastructures are more often equipped with heat pumps.

An alternative to heat pumps is the adoption of liquid cooling throughout a data center. Different liquid cooling techniques are mixed and matched to allow for a fully liquid-cooled infrastructure that captures all heat with water. Different liquid technologies are categorized in 3 main groups, indirect liquid cooling (water-cooled racks), direct liquid cooling (direct-to-chip cooling) and total liquid cooling (complete immersion in liquid, see server immersion cooling). This combination of technologies allows the creation of a thermal cascade as part of temperature chaining scenarios to create high-temperature water outputs from the data center.

=== Impact on electricity prices ===
Cryptomining and the artificial intelligence boom of the 2020s has also led to increased demand for electricity, that the IEA expects could double global overall data center demand for electricity between 2022 and 2026. The US could see its share of the electricity market going to data centers increase from 4% to 6% over those four years. Bitcoin used up 2% of US electricity in 2023. This has led to increased electricity prices in some regions, particularly in regions with lots of data centers like Santa Clara, California and upstate New York. Data centers have also generated concerns in Northern Virginia about whether residents will have to foot the bill for future power lines. It has also made it harder to develop housing in London. A Bank of America Institute report in July 2024 found that the increase in demand for electricity due in part to AI has been pushing electricity prices higher and is a significant contributor to electricity inflation.

==Dynamic infrastructure==

Dynamic infrastructure provides the ability to intelligently, automatically and securely move workloads within a data center anytime, anywhere, for migrations, provisioning, to enhance performance, or building co-location facilities. It also facilitates performing routine maintenance on either physical or virtual systems all while minimizing interruption. A related concept is Composable Infrastructure, which allows for the dynamic reconfiguration of the available resources to suit needs, only when needed.

Side benefits include
* reducing cost
* facilitating business continuity and high availability
* enabling cloud and grid computing.

==Network infrastructure==

Communications in data centers today are most often based on networks running the Internet protocol suite. Data centers contain a set of routers and switches that transport traffic between the servers and to the outside world which are connected according to the data center network architecture. Redundancy of the internet connection is often provided by using two or more upstream service providers (see Multihoming).

Some of the servers at the data center are used for running the basic internet and intranet services needed by internal users in the organization, e.g., e-mail servers, proxy servers, and DNS servers.

Network security elements are also usually deployed: firewalls, VPN gateways, intrusion detection systems, and so on. Also common are monitoring systems for the network and some of the applications. Additional off-site monitoring systems are also typical, in case of a failure of communications inside the data center.

==Software/data backup==
Non-mutually exclusive options for data backup are:

* Onsite
* Offsite

Onsite is traditional, and one of its major advantages is immediate availability.

===Offsite backup storage===
Data backup techniques include having an encrypted copy of the data offsite. Methods used for transporting data are:
* Having the customer write the data to a physical medium, such as magnetic tape, and then transporting the tape elsewhere.
* Directly transferring the data to another site during the backup, using appropriate links.
* Uploading the data &quot;into the cloud&quot;.

==Modular data center==
For quick deployment or IT disaster recovery, several large hardware vendors have developed mobile/modular solutions that can be installed and made operational in a very short amount of time.

== Micro data center ==
Micro data centers (MDCs) are access-level data centers which are smaller in size than traditional data centers but provide the same features. They are typically located near the data source to reduce communication delays, as their small size allows several MDCs to be spread out over a wide area. MDCs are well suited to user-facing, front end applications. They are commonly used in edge computing and other areas where low latency data processing is needed.

<text>The University of Salamanca () is a public research university in Salamanca, Spain. Founded in 1218 by King Alfonso IX, it is the oldest university in the Hispanic world and the third oldest in the world in continuous operation. It has over 30,000 students from 50 different nationalities.

== History ==

Prior to the foundation of the university, Salamanca was home to a cathedral school, known to have been in existence by 1130. The university was founded as a &quot;studium generale&quot; by the Leonese king Alfonso IX in 1218 as the &quot;scholas Salamanticae&quot;, with the actual creation of the university (or the transformation of the existing school into the university) occurring between August 1218 and the following winter. A further royal charter from King Alfonso X, dated 8 May 1254, established rules for the organisation and financial endowment of the university, and referred to it for the first time by that name. A papal bull of Alexander IV in 1255 confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X and granted universal recognition to the university&#x27;s degrees.

The historical phrases &quot;Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat&quot; (what nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend, in Latin) and &quot;Multos et doctissimos Salmantica habet&quot; (many and very versed Salamanca has) give an idea of the prestige the institution rapidly acquired.

In the reign of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, the Spanish government was revamped. Contemporary with the Spanish Inquisition, the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims, and the conquest of Granada, there was a certain professionalization of the apparatus of the state. This involved the massive employment of &quot;letrados&quot;, i.e., bureaucrats and lawyers, who were &quot;licenciados&quot; (university graduates), particularly, of Salamanca, and the newly founded University of Alcalá. These men staffed the various councils of state, including, eventually, the Consejo de Indias and Casa de Contratacion, the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the Spanish Empire in the New World.

While Columbus was lobbying the King and Queen for a contract to seek out a western route to the Indies, he made his case to a council of geographers at the University of Salamanca. While the geographers were skeptical of Columbus and his voyage calculations, the University of Salamanca always defended the theory of unknown territories to the west, and supported Columbus&#x27; voyage, believing that new territories may be discovered. In the next century, the morality and laws of colonization in the Indies were debated by the School of Salamanca, along with the development of the study of science, geography and cartography of the Americas, and as well as the study of general subjects of economics, philosophy and theology.

Salamanca&#x27;s colleges (&quot;Colegios Mayores&quot;) were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the university. By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them. Most were destroyed by Napoleon&#x27;s troops. In the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university&#x27;s faculties of canon law and theology. They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.

==Related affairs==
The faculty renovated the theology department, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the Council of Trent. The school&#x27;s mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, Beatriz Galindo and Luisa de Medrano, the latter probably being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.

===Sorcery===
In popular belief, the university was associated with sorcery. A certain cave in Salamanca was considered the site of a school of black magic. In Spanish, Salamanca may mean &quot;cave&quot;, &quot;an evil iguana&quot; and &quot;hand trick&quot; and the (, the Spanish name is also derived from &quot;salamander&quot;) is a reptile with magical attributes in Spanish tradition.
In Romanian folklore, the devil runs a school of black magic named .

The name is derived from &quot;Salamanca&quot; and the wise king &quot;Solomon&quot;.

==Present day==
Salamanca draws undergraduate and graduate students from across Spain and the world; it is the top-ranked university in Spain based on the number of students coming from other regions. It is also known for its Spanish courses for non-native speakers, which attract more than two thousand foreign students each year.

Scientific research is carried out in the university and research centers associated with it, such as at the Centro de Investigación del Cáncer [Cancer Research Centre], Instituto de Neurociencias de Castilla y León or INCyL [Institute of Neuroscience of Castile and León], Centro de Láseres Pulsados Ultracortos Ultraintensos [Ultrashort Ultraintense Pulse Lasers Centre]. It is one of only two Hispanophone universities in the world that have a MoU with the United Nations to train language professionals for the organization. In conjunction with the University of Cambridge, the University of Salamanca co-founded the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) in 1989.

In 2018, the institution celebrated its eighth centennial.

<text>The International Union of Railways (, UIC) is an international rail transport industry body based in Paris.

== History ==
The railways of Europe had originated during the nineteenth century as many separate concerns across numerous nations; this led to disparate and conflicting standards emerging and thus onto incompatibility. One prominent example was the British Gauge War, during which different railway companies were laying different track gauges across Great Britain, causing inefficiency wherever a break of gauge occurred, prior to an Act of Parliament the issue in 1846 by establishing one standard gauge of . The early effort towards standardisation somewhat influenced railways aboard as well, however various other track gauges persisted and developed across the world; even through to the twenty first century, incompatible track gauges, let alone other issues, persisted to hinder interoperability efforts.

Several key events happened during the early twentieth century; in the aftermath of the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles, numerous border changes were enacted across Europe, which greatly impacted several formerly united national railway networks while compelling several others together in some cases. It was early into the interwar period that the UIC was established on 17 October 1922 with the principal aim of standardising practices across the railway industry and expanding international cooperation in the sector.

The UIC has introduced numerous classification systems over the decades. During the 1970s, the UIC Franc currency equivalent was established for the purpose of easing international ticket revenue sharing; it was replaced by the European Currency Unit on 1 January 1990. UIC classification and UIC Country Codes allowed precise determination of rolling stock capabilities and ownership; furthermore, wagons have been assigned their own unique UIC wagon numbers.

Over time, the UIC has formed various partnerships and cooperative frameworks with other multinational railway authorities, such as the European Union Agency for Railways. The UIC has played a leading role in the development of Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs), which have gradually taken over from older standards developed by various national railway entities.

During the 1990s, the GSM-R radio telecommunication system was formulated as an international interoperability specification covering voice and signalling systems for railway communications. GSM-R, which is built on GSM technology, was designed to be a cost efficient digital replacement for various existing incompatible in-track cable and analogue railway radio networks. The specification for GSM-R is maintained via the UIC project European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). By June 2023, GSM-R had been implemented across roughly 130,000km of track, along with 90,000 cab radios and 20,000 datalink radio units.

A more capable next-generation radio, the Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) program, is under development as of 2023. In addition to eventually replacing GSM-R, it will provide new capabilities that require more rapid data exchange, such as live video transmission.

== Mission ==
The UIC&#x27;s mission is &quot;to promote rail transport at world level and meet the challenges of mobility and sustainable development.&quot;

== Objectives ==
The UIC&#x27;s main objectives are to:

* Facilitate the sharing of best practices among members (benchmarking)
* Support members in their efforts to develop new business and new areas of activities
* Propose new ways to improve technical and environmental performance
* Promote interoperability, create new world standards for railways (including common standards with other transport modes)
* Develop centres of competence (High Speed, Safety, Security, e-Business, ...)

== Members ==

On 12 November 2010, the UIC opened an African regional office in Tunis, Tunisia with the support of SNCFT.

On 9 March 2022, the UIC suspended all member companies from Russia and Belarus, following Russian invasion of Ukraine.

== Standard terminology ==
In order to provide a common understanding and reduce potential confusion, the UIC has established standard international railway terminology and a trilingual (English-French-German) thesaurus of terms. The thesaurus was the result of cooperation with the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT/) and was published in 1995.

== Classification of railway vehicles ==

The UIC has established systems for the classification of locomotives and their axle arrangements, coaches and goods wagons.

== Some UIC regulations ==
UIC plays an important role in standardization of railway parts, data and terminology, though the degree to which its standards have been adopted by its members varies. Therefore, UIC codes (also known as UIC leaflet) are developed since the beginning of UIC&#x27;s work. A new term for these UIC leaflets is used by UIC for better understanding: International Railway Solution (IRS).

Some UIC codes are:

* UIC 568 The 13-corded standardized connection cable with connector is used to transmit data and commands between the locomotive and the carriages of a passenger train.
* UIC 592-2 Large containers for transport on wagons – Technical conditions to be fulfilled by large containers accepted for use in international traffic. Describes the classes and categories of large containers, handling characteristics, identification markings, and special conditions applying to large tank containers.
* UIC 592-3 Large containers (CT), swap bodies (CM) and transport frames for horizontal transhipment (CA) – Standard report on acceptance tests.
* UIC 592-4 Swap bodies for grab handling and spreader gripping – Technical conditions. Swap bodies are the removable superstructures of road transport vehicles. Their dimensions and some of their fittings are standardised, particularly dimensions, strength parameters and securing devices, of the road vehicle, the wagon and transhipment arrangements (grab-handling grooves, lower securing parts and, in special cases, upper securing parts).
* UIC 596-5 Transport of road vehicles on wagons – Technical organisation – Conveyance of semi-trailers with P coding or N coding on recess wagons. This leaflet sets out regulations and provisions for semi-trailers with normal road transport characteristics for conveyance on fixed-recess carrier wagons. The provisions are valid for semi-trailers, gantry equipment/industrial trucks with grab handles, recess wagon types 1a and 1b in accordance with UIC Leaflet 571–4.
* UIC 596-6 Conveyance of road vehicles on wagons – Technical organisation – Conditions for coding combined-transport load units and combined-transport lines. The leaflet sets out the coding and organisation of loading units in respect of road vehicles on wagons, designed to ensure compatibility of loading units (LU) with the permissible profile for combined transport lines. The provisions aim to facilitate LU identification to speed-up international traffic movements. They are applicable to semi-trailers, swap bodies, roller units loaded on wagons and bogies in combined transport operations.
*FU-7100 Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) User Requirements Specification. Defines a set of technology independent user requirements in the form of individual applications. Each application has been defined to provide or support an identified communications need that is considered necessary for current and future railway operation.

<text>The House of Wessex, also known as the House of Cerdic, the House of the West Saxons, the House of the Gewisse, the Cerdicings and the West Saxon dynasty, refers to the family, traditionally founded by Cerdic of the Gewisse, that ruled Wessex in Southern England from the early 6th century. The house became dominant in southern England after the accession of King Ecgberht in 802. Alfred the Great saved England from Viking conquest in the late ninth century and his grandson Æthelstan became first king of England in 927. The disastrous reign of Æthelred the Unready ended in Danish conquest in 1014. Æthelred and his son Edmund Ironside attempted to resist the Vikings in 1016, but after their deaths the Danish Cnut the Great and his sons ruled until 1042. The House of Wessex then briefly regained power under Æthelred&#x27;s son Edward the Confessor, but lost it after the Confessor&#x27;s reign, with the Norman Conquest in 1066. All kings of England since William II have been descended from the House of Wessex through William the Conqueror&#x27;s wife Matilda of Flanders, who was a descendant of Alfred the Great through his daughter Ælfthryth. Additionally, kings since Henry II have been descended from English kings from the House of Wessex through Henry I&#x27;s wife Matilda of Scotland, who was a great-granddaughter of Edmund Ironside.

==History==
The House of Wessex began to dominate English politics after many years of Mercian hegemony with the reign of Egbert. Egbert&#x27;s grandson Alfred the Great ruled as King of the Anglo-Saxons from 886 onward. Alfred&#x27;s son Edward the Elder united southern England under his rule by conquering the Viking occupied areas of Mercia and East Anglia. His son, Æthelstan, extended the kingdom into the northern lands of Northumbria, which lies above the Mersey and Humber, but this was not fully consolidated until after his nephew Edgar succeeded to the throne. 

Their rule was often contested, notably by the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard who invaded in 995 and occupied the united English throne from 1013 to 1014, during the reign of Æthelred the Unready and his son Edmund Ironside. Sweyn, his son Canute and his successors ruled until 1042. After Harthacanute, there was a brief Anglo-Saxon restoration between 1042 and 1066 under Edward the Confessor, who was a son of Æthelred, who was later succeeded by Harold Godwinson, a member of the House of Godwin, possibly a side branch of the Cerdicings (see Ancestry of the Godwins). After the Battle of Hastings, the victorious Duke of Normandy became William I of England. Anglo-Saxon attempts to restore native rule in the person of Edgar the Ætheling, a grandson of Edmund Ironside who had originally been passed over in favour of Harold, were unsuccessful and William&#x27;s descendants secured their rule. Chroniclers describe conflicting stories about Edgar&#x27;s later years, including a supposed involvement in the First Crusade; he is presumed to have died around 1126. A Northumberland pipe roll mentions an &quot;Edgar Adeling&quot; in 1158, and 1167, by which time Edgar would have been over 100 years old. Beyond this, there is no existing evidence that the male line of the Cerdicings continued beyond Edgar Ætheling. Edgar&#x27;s niece Matilda of Scotland later married William&#x27;s son Henry I to consilidate his claim to the throne, since his father, William the Conqueror already had a tenuous claim to the English throne, and he had an even more tenuous one, forming a link between the two dynasties. Henry II was a descendant of the House of Wessex in the female line, something that contemporary English commentators noted with approval.

<text>Sophia Antipolis is a 2,400 hectare technology park in southeast France, and as of 2021 home to 2,500 companies, valued today at more than 5.6 billion euros and employing more than 38,000 people counting more than 80 nationalities. The park is known to be Europe&#x27;s first science and technology hub. The technology park is also a platform, cluster and creation-hub for start-ups.

The &quot;technopole&quot; houses primarily companies in the fields of computing, electronics, telecommunication, pharmacology and biotechnology. Several institutions of higher learning are also located here, along with the European headquarters of W3C, ETSI, European Society of Cardiology, etc.

The park is supported by the &quot;Sophia Antipolis Foundation&quot;, which aims to support &quot;technological and scientific innovation and research projects at the service of mankind and our environment.&quot; The foundation’s honorary chairman is Pierre Laffitte and its president is Jean-Pierre Mascarelli, who is also president of SYMISA, the &quot;Sophia Antipolis Joint Association&quot;, which is &quot;responsible for managing land, equipment, marketing and upkeeping the park and is involved with coordination activities for harmonious development of the technology park.&quot;

== Naming ==
Sophia Antipolis is named after Sophie Glikman-Toumarkine, the wife of French Senator Pierre Laffitte, founder of the park, and incidentally, Sophia, the Greek word for wisdom, and &quot;Antipolis&quot;, the ancient (Greek) name of a nearby seaside town Antibes. Many of the roads within the technology park have Greek names. There is a giant sculptured Greek urn as a centre-piece on one of the roundabouts.

The park is also termed a &quot;technopole&quot;.

== History ==
Gérald Hanning was the consultant advisor to the DATAR for this industrial/scientific complex created 1970 to 1984.

French Senator Pierre Laffitte conceived the idea of Sophia Antipolis, calling for decentralization and &quot;rural branch of the capital&quot;.

In 2016, the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy was relocated from Montreuil to Sophia Antipolis.

The year 2019 marks the 50th anniversary of the park.

== Agenda 2040 ==
An agenda named &quot;Sophia 2040&quot; was created to &quot;restore the former glory of the technology park&#x27;s historic centre&quot;.

Further novel investments e. g. into intelligent vehicle technology have been initiated.

== Location ==
The technology park lies over an area that stretches into 5 municipalities or communes, much of it falling within the commune of Valbonne, which lies northwest of Antibes and southwest of Nice, France.

== Residential community ==
Several neighborhoods within the park area exist, which make the area attractive to live: Garbejaire, Haut-Sartoux, Saint-Philippe and the Place Sophie Laffitte. The locations include typical public services such as a post office, shops, hairdressers, a primary school, sport complexes, hotels, church, children play areas, etc. The area is also surrounded by multiple golf courses and located north of the science park lies the large Regional Natural Park of the Préalpes d&#x27;Azur.

==Public transport==

Several bus routes (27 urban routes and 64 school bus routes) cover the vast area of the technology park. The main bus route (Ligne A, formerly known as Ligne 1), that was redesigned in 2020, connects the central bus station of the park (Gare Routière Valbonne - Sophia Antipolis) with Antibes railway station and Juan les Pins, with bus stops at main universities such as Polytech Nice Sophia and SKEMA. Antibes railway station provides access to the Riviera coastal railway (TER Provence-Alpes-Côte-d&#x27;Azur) with eastbound trains to Nice, Monaco and Ventimiglia, or westbound trains to Toulon and Marseille.

The technology park also has special express lines directly connecting the park with neighbouring cities:
* Ligne 230 (Nice - Sophia Antipolis)
* Ligne 232 (St. Laurent du Var - Sophia Antipolis)
* Ligne 530 (Grasse - Sophia Antipolis)
* Ligne 630 (Cannes - Valbonne)
* Envibus Ligne A (Antibes - Valbonne)

The nearest international airport for the general public is the Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport. Passengers travelling through private jets and non-scheduled flights can use the Cannes – Mandelieu Airport as an alternative.

==Academic and research institutions==
* European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM), the European home of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
* European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
* EURECOM
* INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis unit

* Mines ParisTech, École Nationale Supérieure de Mines de Paris
* Polytech Nice Sophia, polytechnic school of the University of Côte d&#x27;Azur, formerly known as University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis
* Skema Business School, School of Knowledge Economy and Management

==Companies==
The technology park as of 2021 lists around 2,500 companies. The park also benefits from close proximity of other large corporations in the area, e. g. Thales Alenia Space (in Cannes), IBM (La Gaude) and Schneider Electric (Carros). Furthermore, the park is near the large city of Nice and its industries.

<doc id="579750" wikidata="Q22275999" url="?curid=579750" title="Methanogenesis">
<text>Methanogenesis or biomethanation is the formation of methane coupled to energy conservation by microbes known as methanogens. It is the fourth and final stage of anaerobic digestion. Organisms capable of producing methane for energy conservation have been identified only from the domain Archaea, a group phylogenetically distinct from both eukaryotes and bacteria, although many live in close association with anaerobic bacteria. The production of methane is an important and widespread form of microbial metabolism. In anoxic environments, it is the final step in the decomposition of biomass. Methanogenesis is responsible for significant amounts of natural gas accumulations, the remainder being thermogenic.

==Biochemistry==
Methanogenesis in microbes is a form of anaerobic respiration. Methanogens do not use oxygen to respire; in fact, oxygen inhibits the growth of methanogens. The terminal electron acceptor in methanogenesis is not oxygen, but carbon. The two best described pathways involve the use of acetic acid (acetoclastic) or inorganic carbon dioxide (hydrogenotrophic) as terminal electron acceptors:
:CO2 + 4 H2 → CH4 + 2 H2O

:CH3COOH → CH4 + CO2

During anaerobic respiration of carbohydrates, H2 and acetate are formed in a ratio of 2:1 or lower, so H2 contributes only to methanogenesis, with acetate contributing the greater proportion. In some circumstances, for instance in the rumen, where acetate is largely absorbed into the bloodstream of the host, the contribution of H2 to methanogenesis is greater.

However, depending on pH and temperature, methanogenesis has been shown to use carbon from other small organic compounds, such as formic acid (formate), methanol, methylamines, tetramethylammonium, dimethyl sulfide, and methanethiol. The catabolism of the methyl compounds is mediated by methyl transferases to give methyl coenzyme M.

===Proposed mechanism===
The biochemistry of methanogenesis involves the following coenzymes and cofactors: F420, coenzyme B, coenzyme M, methanofuran, and methanopterin.

The mechanism for the conversion of bond into methane involves a ternary complex of the enzyme, with the substituents forming a structure α2β2γ2. Within the complex, methyl coenzyme M and coenzyme B fit into a channel terminated by the axial site on nickel of the cofactor F430. One proposed mechanism invokes electron transfer from Ni(I) (to give Ni(II)), which initiates formation of . Coupling of the coenzyme M thiyl radical (RS.) with HS coenzyme B releases a proton and re-reduces Ni(II) by one electron, regenerating Ni(I).

===Reverse methanogenesis===
Some organisms can oxidize methane, functionally reversing the process of methanogenesis, also referred to as the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Organisms performing AOM have been found in multiple marine and freshwater environments including methane seeps, hydrothermal vents, coastal sediments and sulfate-methane transition zones. These organisms may accomplish reverse methanogenesis using a nickel-containing protein similar to methyl-coenzyme M reductase used by methanogenic archaea. Reverse methanogenesis occurs according to the reaction:
: + CH4 → + HS− + H2O

===Importance in carbon cycle===
Methanogenesis is the final step in the anaerobic decay of organic matter. During the decay process, electron acceptors (such as oxygen, ferric iron, sulfate, and nitrate) become depleted, while hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide accumulate. Light organics produced by fermentation also accumulate. During advanced stages of organic decay, all electron acceptors become depleted except carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a product of most catabolic processes, so it is not depleted like other potential electron acceptors.

Only methanogenesis and fermentation can occur in the absence of electron acceptors other than carbon. Fermentation only allows the breakdown of larger organic compounds, and produces small organic compounds. Methanogenesis effectively removes the semi-final products of decay: hydrogen, small organics, and carbon dioxide. Without methanogenesis, a great deal of carbon (in the form of fermentation products) would accumulate in anaerobic environments.

==Natural occurrence==

===In ruminants===

Enteric fermentation occurs in the gut of some animals, especially ruminants. In the rumen, anaerobic organisms, including methanogens, digest cellulose into forms nutritious to the animal. Without these microorganisms, animals such as cattle would not be able to consume grasses. The useful products of methanogenesis are absorbed by the gut, but methane is released from the animal mainly by belching (eructation). The average cow emits around 250 liters of methane per day. In this way, ruminants contribute about 25% of anthropogenic methane emissions. One method of methane production control in ruminants is by feeding them 3-nitrooxypropanol.

===In humans===
Some humans produce flatus that contains methane. In one study of the feces of nine adults, five of the samples contained archaea capable of producing methane. Similar results are found in samples of gas obtained from within the rectum.

Even among humans whose flatus does contain methane, the amount is in the range of 10% or less of the total amount of gas.

===In plants===
Many experiments have suggested that leaf tissues of living plants emit methane. Other research has indicated that the plants are not actually generating methane; they are just absorbing methane from the soil and then emitting it through their leaf tissues.

===In soils===
Methanogens are observed in anoxic soil environments, contributing to the degradation of organic matter. This organic matter may be placed by humans through landfill, buried as sediment on the bottom of lakes or oceans as sediments, and as residual organic matter from sediments that have formed into sedimentary rocks.

=== In Earth&#x27;s crust ===
Methanogens are a notable part of the microbial communities in continental and marine deep biosphere.

==Industry==
Methanogenesis can also be beneficially exploited, to treat organic waste, to produce useful compounds, and the methane can be collected and used as biogas, a fuel. It is the primary pathway whereby most organic matter disposed of via landfill is broken down. Some biogas plants use methanogenesis to combine the with hydrogen to create more methane.

==Role in global warming==
Atmospheric methane is an important greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25 times greater than carbon dioxide (averaged over 100 years), and methanogenesis in livestock and the decay of organic material is thus a considerable contributor to global warming. It may not be a net contributor in the sense that it works on organic material which used up atmospheric carbon dioxide when it was created, but its overall effect is to convert the carbon dioxide into methane which is a much more potent greenhouse gas.

==Extra-terrestrial life==

The presence of atmospheric methane has a role in the scientific search for extra-terrestrial life. The justification is that on an astronomical timescale, methane in the atmosphere of an Earth-like celestial body will quickly dissipate, and that its presence on such a planet or moon therefore indicates that something is replenishing it. If methane is detected (by using a spectrometer for example) this may indicate that life is, or recently was, present.
This was debated when methane was discovered in the Martian atmosphere by M.J. Mumma of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Flight Center, and verified by the Mars Express Orbiter (2004) and in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere by the Huygens probe (2005). This debate was furthered with the discovery of &#x27;transient&#x27;, &#x27;spikes of methane&#x27; on Mars by the Curiosity Rover.

It is argued that atmospheric methane can come from volcanoes or other fissures in the planet&#x27;s crust and that without an isotopic signature, the origin or source may be difficult to identify.

On 13 April 2017, NASA confirmed that the dive of the Cassini orbiter spacecraft on 28 October 2015 discovered an Enceladus plume which has all the ingredients for methanogenesis-based life forms to feed on. Previous results, published in March 2015, suggested hot water is interacting with rock beneath the sea of Enceladus; the new finding supported that conclusion, and add that the rock appears to be reacting chemically. From these observations scientists have determined that nearly 98 percent of the gas in the plume is water, about 1 percent is hydrogen, and the rest is a mixture of other molecules including carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia.

<text>The United States Department of State Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is responsible for overseeing the construction, management, and operations of U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.

==Mission==

OBO’s mission is to provide the most effective facilities for United States diplomacy abroad and support the Department’s achievement of U.S. foreign policy objectives.

OBO sets worldwide priorities for the design, construction, acquisition, maintenance, use, and sale of real property, as well as the allocation of sale proceeds. As one of the world’s largest and most experienced real estate owners and developers, OBO has a $75B portfolio replacement value and a global presence spanning over 280 locations throughout the world.  

As of October 2024, Patricia Lacina, a career member of the Senior Foreign Service, holding the rank of Career Minister, assumed the position of Director for the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO).

==History==

OBO has its origins in the Foreign Service Buildings Commission, which was established in 1926 under the Foreign Service Buildings Act. This legislation granted the Secretary of State the authority to acquire by purchase, construction, or exchange sites and buildings in foreign capitals and other foreign cities; to maintain, repair, improve, and refurbish these properties; and to dispose of properties that become surplus, underutilized, or uneconomical. The act also granted the Secretary of State the authority to provide residential and office space and necessary related facilities to other agencies overseas whose employees are under the authority of the Chief of Mission. The creation of the Foreign Service Buildings Commission was a response to public concerns regarding the state of American diplomatic posts abroad. Over the years, several pivotal events triggered significant changes within OBO and its predecessor organizations.

One such event was the attack on the U.S. embassy in Beirut in 1983, which prompted the Advisory Panel on Overseas Security to charge the then Office of Foreign Buildings Operations with the task of replacing embassies and consulates that failed to meet essential security standards. However, challenges such as the availability of suitable sites and funding led to the abandonment of over a third of the initially planned projects.

Fifteen years later, after the tragic bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998, the Secretary of State established the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel. This panel was tasked with assessing the United States’ global presence and the condition of the Department&#x27;s facilities. Their final report contained both broad and specific recommendations for the future of the Department&#x27;s building program.

Among the observations made in the report were concerns about unsafe, overcrowded, deteriorating, and substandard conditions at numerous U.S. embassies and consulates. The panel&#x27;s findings also indicated that over 80 percent of diplomatic facilities abroad were vulnerable to future attacks. In response, the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act (SECCA) was enacted in 1999, which enshrined security requirements for Department facilities overseas.

As a result of these developments, the Department elevated the Office of Foreign Buildings Operations to the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations. The newly designated Bureau was charged with replacing more than 180 aging embassies that did not meet all security standards, marking an unprecedented endeavor in the Department&#x27;s history. To achieve this goal, the Department collaborated closely with the Office of Management and Budget and Congress to secure reliable funding commitments.

=== Program Evolution ===
OBO’s history is defined by distinct periods or eras. Its initial era was characterized by a focus on adaptivity, involving the acquisition and conversion of extant residential properties for diplomatic purposes before progressing to the deliberate design and construction of purpose-built facilities.

In the subsequent Modern era, facilities were constructed that more aptly embodied U.S. values, including democracy, transparency, and diplomacy with host countries where operational activities were conducted.

The transition into the Security and Excellence era saw a discernible shift towards prioritizing security measures and establishing secure platforms for both property users and visitors.

Currently, OBO is in the Security, Resilience, Stewardship, and Effectiveness era, representing the culmination of the Bureau’s accumulated experience and exemplifying the commitment to provide future-ready, adaptable, and sustainable facilities.  

==Managing Directorates==

=== Planning &amp; Real Estate ===
The Planning &amp; Real Estate (PRE) directorate within OBO is responsible for the oversight and implementation of the U.S. Department of State’s building and real estate programs. This directorate focuses on strategically managing real estate for U.S. diplomatic facilities abroad, ensuring that these facilities are located in suitable, secure, and functional spaces, while also adhering to host country regulations and environmental objectives.

The PRE directorate advises the OBO Director on long-range and strategic facility planning and real property programs and policies for the Department of State and the U.S. Government community serving abroad. Additionally, PRE oversees the Department’s asset management program, including real property acquisition and disposal plans, and conducts financial evaluations of properties proposed for acquisition abroad. The directorate is also responsible for strategic facility planning, long-term master planning, property negotiations with foreign governments, the Capital Security Cost-Sharing Program, and reporting Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) for the State Department. Furthermore, it manages the sale and decommissioning of properties.

=== Program Development, Coordination &amp; Support   ===
The Program Development, Coordination, and Support (PDCS) directorate within OBO is responsible for overseeing and coordinating programs related to U.S. diplomatic facilities abroad, with a focus on construction and renovation projects. This directorate advises the OBO Director on the development and delivery of funded capital construction and noncapital programs, while ensuring that these projects align with U.S. government objectives, budgets, and schedules. It also provides guidance for selecting architectural and engineering firms for OBO design contracts and formulates criteria, guidelines, policies, and standards to meet its functional responsibilities. The PDCS directorate oversees functional offices that offer design and engineering, cost management, and project management services for assigned projects, contributing to the overall efficiency and success of these initiatives.  

=== Construction &amp; Security Management ===
The Construction &amp; Security Management (CSM) directorate within OBO is primarily responsible for the construction, security, and maintenance of the State Department&#x27;s diplomatic platforms across the globe. This directorate formulates management criteria, guidelines, and policies for new office buildings, major renovations, and upgrade projects for Department facilities abroad. These standards encompass security and safety, ensuring the protection and efficient functioning of U.S. diplomatic facilities worldwide.

=== Operations ===
The Operations (OPS) Directorate within OBO plays a vital role in ensuring the efficient operation of U.S. diplomatic facilities worldwide. It oversees facility maintenance, repair, and supports small-scale projects at posts abroad. Additionally, OPS provides expert advisory services on facility operations and overseas programs, while actively assisting with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) responsibilities on behalf of the Department&#x27;s Designated Agency Safety and Health Official (DASHO). Serving as a vital liaison between posts, OBO, and regional bureaus, the directorate extends its oversight to specialized offices that collectively address safety, health, environmental management, and cultural matters concerning these facilities. This comprehensive approach ensures the secure, efficient, and culturally resonant operation of U.S. diplomatic platforms worldwide.

=== Comptroller ===
The Comptroller of the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is a key administrative position responsible for overseeing the bureau&#x27;s budget and financial management, strategic planning, Congressional reporting, and policy functions. This role involves the management and allocation of financial resources to support OBO&#x27;s mission and the efficient operation of U.S. diplomatic facilities abroad. The Comptroller plays an instrumental role in shaping OBO&#x27;s strategic initiatives, ensuring financial accountability, and providing essential reporting and policy guidance to support the bureau&#x27;s activities.

==Art in Embassies==
For over five decades, Art in Embassies (AIE) has played a leading role in U.S. public diplomacy through a focused mission of vital cross-cultural dialogue and understanding through the visual arts and dynamic artist exchange. The Museum of Modern Art first envisioned this global visual arts program in 1953, and President John F. Kennedy formalized it at the U.S. Department of State in 1963. Today, Art in Embassies is an official visual arts office within the U.S. Department of State, engaging over 20,000 participants globally, including artists, museums, galleries, universities, and private collectors. It encompasses over 200 venues in 189 countries. Professional curators and registrars create and ship about 60 exhibitions per year, and since 2000, over 70 permanent collections have been installed in the Department’s diplomatic facilities throughout the world.

Art in Embassies fosters U.S. relations within local communities world-wide – in the last decade, more than 100 artists have traveled to countries participating in AIE’s exchange programs and collaborated with local artists to produce works now on display in embassies and consulates. Going forward, AIE will continue to engage, educate, and inspire global audiences, showing how art can transcend national borders and build connections among peoples.

== Office of Cultural Heritage ==
The Office of Cultural Heritage was established in 2015, under the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations. The Office of Cultural Heritage implements a stewardship program for the care of the Department of State’s culturally, historically, and architecturally significant properties and collections through research, conservation, educational programs, exhibit design, and maintenance protocols.

Cultural Heritage staff undertakes research to determine historical significance and conducts condition assessments to inform treatment recommendations for historic properties and collections. The product of this research is used to guide the future management and care of the portfolio of buildings and objects. Information is also shared with the public through outreach and education opportunities such as those found on this website and through programs like the Secretary of State’s Register for Culturally Significant Property.  

Using modern technology and drawing on in-house expertise in historic preservation and fine arts conservation, the Office of Cultural Heritage oversees special projects for diplomatic posts abroad when historic buildings and collections are affected. This requires collaboration with and education for facilities managers, OBO design professionals, and outside contractors to meet required preservation codes and best practices.  

The Office of Cultural Heritage regularly works with student groups studying historic preservation by hosting them at a historic embassy abroad for a week of learning and research. This exchange allows for a hands-on experience for young preservation professionals and adds to the knowledge about these properties through the student’s findings and presentations.  

Whether for an ambassador’s residence, an embassy, or with a public institution, the Office of Cultural Heritage creates exhibits that showcase American diplomatic history around the world. These exhibits utilized the Department of State’s collection of cultural objects and historic buildings as well as partnerships with public and private institutions through loan programs. While many of these guests are only viewable by invited guests to our overseas properties, the Office of Cultural Heritage seeks to make them accessible to the public.  

== The Office of Policy and Program Analysis ==
This office is responsible for managing the bureau&#x27;s overall engagements with Congress, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and is the central focal point for conveying oversight and accountability information to these external entities. RM/P is also responsible for managing the bureau&#x27;s strategic planning development, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation processes and products such as the Functional Bureau Strategy (FBS), Bureau Resource Request (BRR) submission, Annual Performance Plan/Annual Performance Review, among others. The office coordinates the development of OBO policy directives and revisions to the Foreign Affairs Manual and Foreign Affairs Handbooks (FAM/FAH) and internal Policy and Standard Operating Procedures Directives, and provides policy development assistance to all OBO Offices. Lastly, RM/P manages all responses to OIG Hotline Complaints, FOIA requests, and Congressional inquiries.

<doc id="579755" wikidata="Q621727" url="?curid=579755" title="Mach–Zehnder interferometer">
<text>The Mach–Zehnder interferometer is a device used to determine the relative phase shift variations between two collimated beams derived by splitting light from a single source. The interferometer has been used, among other things, to measure phase shifts between the two beams caused by a sample or a change in length of one of the paths. The apparatus is named after the physicists Ludwig Mach (the son of Ernst Mach) and Ludwig Zehnder; Zehnder&#x27;s proposal in an 1891 article was refined by Mach in an 1892 article. Mach–Zehnder interferometry has been demonstrated with electrons as well as with light. The versatility of the Mach–Zehnder configuration has led to its being used in a range of research topics efforts especially in fundamental quantum mechanics.

== Design ==
The Mach–Zehnder interferometer is a highly configurable instrument. In contrast to the well-known Michelson interferometer, each of the well-separated light paths is traversed only once.

If the source has a low coherence length then great care must be taken to equalize the two optical paths. White light in particular requires the optical paths to be simultaneously equalized over all wavelengths, or no fringes will be visible (unless a monochromatic filter is used to isolate a single wavelength). As seen in Fig. 1, a compensating cell made of the same type of glass as the test cell (so as to have equal optical dispersion) would be placed in the path of the reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light travels through an equal optical path length in both the test and reference beams leading to constructive interference.

Collimated sources result in a nonlocalized fringe pattern. Localized fringes result when an extended source is used. In Fig. 2, we see that the fringes can be adjusted so that they are localized in any desired plane. In most cases, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together.

== Operation ==
The collimated beam is split by a half-silvered mirror. The two resulting beams (the &quot;sample beam&quot; and the &quot;reference beam&quot;) are each reflected by a mirror. The two beams then pass a second half-silvered mirror and enter two detectors.

The Fresnel equations for reflection and transmission of a wave at a dielectric imply that there is a phase change for a reflection, when a wave propagating in a lower-refractive index medium reflects from a higher-refractive index medium, but not in the opposite case. A 180° phase shift occurs upon reflection from the front of a mirror, since the medium behind the mirror (glass) has a higher refractive index than the medium the light is traveling in (air). No phase shift accompanies a rear-surface reflection, since the medium behind the mirror (air) has a lower refractive index than the medium the light is traveling in (glass).

The speed of light is lower in media with an index of refraction greater than that of a vacuum, which is 1. Specifically, its speed is: &quot;v&quot; = &quot;c&quot;/&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum, and &quot;n&quot; is the index of refraction. This causes a phase shift increase proportional to (&quot;n&quot; − 1) × &quot;length traveled&quot;. If &quot;k&quot; is the constant phase shift incurred by passing through a glass plate on which a mirror resides, a total of 2&quot;k&quot; phase shift occurs when reflecting from the rear of a mirror. This is because light traveling toward the rear of a mirror will enter the glass plate, incurring &quot;k&quot; phase shift, and then reflect from the mirror with no additional phase shift, since only air is now behind the mirror, and travel again back through the glass plate, incurring an additional &quot;k&quot; phase shift.

The rule about phase shifts applies to beamsplitters constructed with a dielectric coating and must be modified if a metallic coating is used or when different polarizations are taken into account. Also, in real interferometers, the thicknesses of the beamsplitters may differ, and the path lengths are not necessarily equal. Regardless, in the absence of absorption, conservation of energy guarantees that the two paths must differ by a half-wavelength phase shift. Also beamsplitters that are not 50/50 are frequently employed to improve the interferometer&#x27;s performance in certain types of measurement.

In Fig. 3, in the absence of a sample, both the sample beam (SB) and the reference beam (RB) will arrive in phase at detector 1, yielding constructive interference. Both SB and RB will have undergone a phase shift of (1 × wavelength + &quot;k&quot;) due to two front-surface reflections and one transmission through a glass plate. At detector 2, in the absence of a sample, the sample beam and reference beam will arrive with a phase difference of half a wavelength, yielding complete destructive interference. The RB arriving at detector 2 will have undergone a phase shift of (0.5 × wavelength + 2&quot;k&quot;) due to one front-surface reflection and two transmissions. The SB arriving at detector 2 will have undergone a (1 × wavelength + 2&quot;k&quot;) phase shift due to two front-surface reflections, one rear-surface reflection. Therefore, when there is no sample, only detector 1 receives light. If a sample is placed in the path of the sample beam, the intensities of the beams entering the two detectors will change, allowing the calculation of the phase shift caused by the sample.

== Quantum treatment ==

We can model a photon going through the interferometer by assigning a probability amplitude to each of the two possible paths: the &quot;lower&quot; path which starts from the left, goes straight through both beam splitters, and ends at the top, and the &quot;upper&quot; path which starts from the bottom, goes straight through both beam splitters, and ends at the right. The quantum state describing the photon is therefore a vector formula_1 that is a superposition of the &quot;lower&quot; path formula_2 and the &quot;upper&quot; path formula_3, that is, formula_4 for complex formula_5 such that formula_6.

Both beam splitters are modelled as the unitary matrix formula_7, which means that when a photon meets the beam splitter it will either stay on the same path with a probability amplitude of formula_8, or be reflected to the other path with a probability amplitude of formula_9. The phase shifter on the upper arm is modelled as the unitary matrix formula_10, which means that if the photon is on the &quot;upper&quot; path it will gain a relative phase of formula_11, and it will stay unchanged if it is on the lower path.

A photon that enters the interferometer from the left will then end up described by the state

: formula_12
and the probabilities that it will be detected at the right or at the top are given respectively by
: formula_13
: formula_14

One can therefore use the Mach–Zehnder interferometer to estimate the phase shift by estimating these probabilities.

It is interesting to consider what would happen if the photon were definitely in either the &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;upper&quot; paths between the beam splitters. This can be accomplished by blocking one of the paths, or equivalently by removing the first beam splitter (and feeding the photon from the left or the bottom, as desired). In both cases there will no longer be interference between the paths, and the probabilities are given by formula_15, independently of the phase formula_11. From this we can conclude that the photon does not take one path or another after the first beam splitter, but rather that it must be described by a genuine quantum superposition of the two paths.

== Uses ==

The Mach–Zehnder interferometer&#x27;s relatively large and freely accessible working space, and its flexibility in locating the fringes has made it the interferometer of choice for visualizing flow in wind tunnels and for flow visualization studies in general. It is frequently used in the fields of aerodynamics, plasma physics and heat transfer to measure pressure, density, and temperature changes in gases.

Mach–Zehnder interferometers are used in electro-optic modulators, electronic devices used in various fiber-optic communication applications. Mach–Zehnder modulators are incorporated in monolithic integrated circuits and offer well-behaved, high-bandwidth electro-optic amplitude and phase responses over a multiple-gigahertz frequency range.

Mach–Zehnder interferometers are also used to study one of the most counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics, the phenomenon known as quantum entanglement.

The possibility to easily control the features of the light in the reference channel without disturbing the light in the object channel popularized the Mach–Zehnder configuration in holographic interferometry. In particular, optical heterodyne detection with an off-axis, frequency-shifted reference beam ensures good experimental conditions for shot-noise limited holography with video-rate cameras, vibrometry, and laser Doppler imaging of blood flow.

In optical telecommunications it is used as an electro-optic modulator for phase and amplitude modulation of light. Optical computing researchers have proposed using Mach-Zehnder interferometer configurations in optical neural chips for greatly accelerating complex-valued neural network algorithms.

The versatility of the Mach–Zehnder configuration has led to its being used in a wide range of fundamental research topics in quantum mechanics, including studies on counterfactual definiteness, quantum entanglement, quantum computation, quantum cryptography, quantum logic, Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester, the quantum eraser experiment, the quantum Zeno effect, and neutron diffraction.

<text>*Star is a complex abstract strategy game by Ea Ea, a designer of Y. It is a redevelopment of his earlier game Star.

==Notation==

Each cell on the game board is labeled with a three-character value &quot;Nxy&quot; according to a polar coordinate system:
* &quot;N&quot; refers to the primary radial arm. There are five arms, labeled as *, S, T, A, or R, proceeding clockwise from the point of the lower right arm of the five-pointed star in the middle of the board
* &quot;x&quot; refers to the ring number of the cell. The concentric rings are labeled from 1 to 10, using the rightmost digit only, with Ring 1 (&quot;x&quot;=1) in the center of the board and Ring 10 (&quot;x&quot;=0) on the perimeter of the board.
* &quot;y&quot; refers to the tangential position of the cell, counted clockwise from the radial arm. For example, in Ring 3, the cells would be labeled *30 (for the cell on the &quot;*&quot; primary radial arm), *31 (for the cell immediately clockwise within the same ring), *32, S30, S31, S32, T30, ... R31, R32.

This board illustrated here has sectors colored corresponding to the primary radial arms to distinguish the tangential positions (in this example, the &quot;A&quot; sector is colored green). In the game, the board is a single, uniform color.

The perimeter cells (in the ten-ring example illustrated, &quot;N&quot;0&quot;y&quot;) are called the &quot;pericells&quot; and each contain one &quot;peri&quot;. The five corner pericells (&quot;N&quot;00 for the ten-ring example) each have one &quot;quark&quot; associated with them.
The &quot;*Star&quot; board can also be represented as an equivalent mesh of nodes instead of cells. The same &quot;Nxy&quot; nomenclature may be used to refer to each node instead.
==Rules==

&quot;*Star&quot; can be played on graphs of different sizes. The small, medium, and full boards shown below have 105, 180, and 275 nodes, respectively, of which 30, 40, and 50 are on the perimeter, respectively. Note the five-pointed star in the center acts as a bridge which links the five centermost nodes to each other.

Two players alternately place stones of their colour on empty nodes. The game ends when the board is filled up (or when both players agree that the score is decided).

Each node on the perimeter of the board contains one &quot;peri&quot;. Each corner node contains one &quot;quark&quot; in addition to the peri for being a perimeter node. A &quot;star&quot; exists when a connected group of a single color owns at least two peries. A peri is owned if it is either directly occupied by that star, or if the peri is enclosed by the territory occupied by the star.

The game is scored by the sum total of:
* 1 point for each &quot;peri&quot; owned (occupied or surrounded)
* 1 point to the player with three (or more) &quot;quarks&quot; (the &quot;quark peri&quot;)
* An adjustment &quot;reward&quot; based on the relative number of stars per player

For clarification when computing the score, groups owning fewer than two &quot;peries&quot; may be removed, making it clear those &quot;peries&quot; are owned by the surrounding &quot;star&quot;.

The &quot;reward&quot; adjustment is computed as the difference between the number of stars the other player has and the number of stars owned by the player, doubled. Effectively, it penalizes the player with more stars and rewards the player who has more effectively grouped their stars. The player with the higher adjusted score wins. In the event of a tie, the player with the most quarks (corners) wins. Under this system, the sum of both players&#x27; scores is equal to the number of edge cells (or nodes), plus one. For the &quot;full&quot; board with 10 rings, the total score is 51.

===Simplified scoring===
As a simplification, each remaining star is worth the number of peries it contains minus four. For example, a group containing exactly two peries is worth 2−4 = −2 points. This is the same as the two peries being given to the opponent. That is, creating a group with just two peries is worthless unless it disconnects opponent groups or contains a corner, which could contribute to the quark peri bonus.

An alternative scoring system has been suggested by R. Wayne Schmittberger. In the alternative system, the score is computed as the number of &quot;peries&quot; owned by the player, minus the number of &quot;peries&quot; owned by the opponent, including the &quot;quark peri&quot; plus an alternative adjustment reward. The alternative adjustment reward is the player&#x27;s conventional reward adjustment (double the difference in stars) minus the opponent&#x27;s conventional reward adjustment. Under this system, a player wins if their score is positive.

===Scoring example 1===

In the example game shown here on a 4-ring board, Blue has created a single star, using the five-pointed bridge in the center of the board to connect the two regions. The Blue star owns 7 &quot;peries&quot; (directly occupying R43, *40, *41, S41, T41, A40, and A41) and 2 &quot;quarks&quot; (*40 and A40). Red has created three stars with a total of 14 &quot;peries&quot; (the larger star also connects using the five-pointed bridge and owns 8 &quot;peries&quot; by occupying 5: *42, S40, A42, R40, and R42 and surrounding 3: *43, A43, and R41; the smaller star owns 3 &quot;peries&quot; by occupying 2: S42 and T40 and surrounding 1: S43; the smallest star owns 2 &quot;peries&quot; through occupation of T42 and T43). In addition, Red stars collectively own 3 &quot;quarks&quot; (S40, T40, and R40), giving Red the &quot;quark peri&quot;.

Although Red has won more &quot;peries&quot; (14) than Blue (7), Blue has taken ownership of those 7 peries using 1 star, while Red has created 3 stars. Therefore the Blue &quot;reward&quot; is 2×(3-1) = +4, while the Red &quot;reward&quot; is 2×(1-3) = -4. The final score is Blue 7+4=11, Red 14-4=10, and Blue wins this match by more efficiently grouping its pieces.

Using the simplified scoring system, Blue has 7 peries in a single star (-4), for a net total of 3 points. Red has 13 peries in three stars (-12) plus the quark peri (+1), for a total of 2 points.

Under the alternative Schmittberger scoring system, Blue has 7-11+(4-(-4)) = 4 points, while Red has 11-7+(-4-4) = -4 points.

Note that placing additional pieces on the board will not affect the scoring of this game, as the perimeter cells / nodes are all owned by occupation or surrounding pieces, and the stars cannot be further connected.

===Scoring example 2===

In the second example game shown here on a 4-ring board, both Blue and Red have created three stars. The scoring breaks down as:
* Blue
** 10 &quot;peries&quot; (*43, S41, S42, T40, T43, A40, A42, R40, R41 occupied; S43 surrounded)
** 3 &quot;quarks&quot; (T40, A40, R40)
** 1 &quot;quark peri&quot; (owns three quarks)
* Red
** 10 &quot;peries&quot; (*41, *42, S40, T41, T42, A41, A43, R42, R43 occupied; *40 surrounded)
** 2 &quot;quarks&quot; (*40, S40)

Because each player has three stars, the &quot;reward&quot; adjustment is zero for both. The small two-stone star at T43-A40 was key to the win; although it only includes two &quot;peries&quot;, it crucially includes a third &quot;quark&quot;, giving Blue a final score of 11 (including the &quot;quark peri&quot;), edging Red, which scored 10.

Note that although Red has a stone at S43, the &quot;peri&quot; is not counted as a point for Red, as stars are scored only when there are two or more peries. Instead, the peri is claimed by Blue by surrounding that node.

==Development==
&quot;*Star&quot; was derived from Ea Ea&#x27;s earlier game &quot;Star&quot; and first published in 2004 by Kadon Enterprises. According to the official rulebook, edited by Irene Schensted from Ea Ea&#x27;s draft, Mark Thompson, Mariah Williams, and R. Wayne Schmittberger provided constructive input.

===Comparison to other games===

&quot;*Star&quot; is closely related to the games &quot;Hex&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; where the goal is to connect certain sides of the board to each other. On the other hand, &quot;*Star&quot; also is closely related to &quot;Go&quot; in which the goal is to gather more territory than the opponent. Often survival of a group in &quot;Go&quot; is achieved by connecting it to another one. In &quot;Go&quot;, all the surrounded area is counted as territory although in practice most of the territory is gathered near the perimeter. Because UCT search was used previously to provide a play-out method for &quot;Go&quot;, researchers in Finland successfully used a similar algorithm to create a strong computer-based player for *Star in 2008.

John McCallion reviewed the game for &quot;Games&quot; in March 2005, calling it &quot;intriguing&quot; due to &quot;the continuing dilemma that players face&quot; of having to balance scoring by occupying perimeter cells with the need to connect as many scoring groups as possible.

<text>The Pantiles is a Georgian colonnade in the town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. Formerly known as &quot;The Walks&quot; and the (Royal) &quot;Parade&quot;, it leads from the well that gave the town its name. The area, developed following the discovery of a chalybeate spring in 1606, has become a popular tourist-attraction.

 the Pantiles includes a variety of specialist shops, art galleries, cafés, restaurants and bars, as well as a farmers market held outside every other Saturday. Throughout the summer jazz bands play outside on the bandstand, attracting hundreds of people.

==Chalybeate spring==

The chalybeate spring is situated at the north-eastern end of The Pantiles at . The spring is overlooked by the Dipper&#x27;s Hall. The waters are rich in iron giving them a unique taste.

Tourists can sample the spring water which is served by costumed &#x27;Dippers&#x27; every summer.

==History==

===1606-1659: Discovery of the wells===
Dudley Lord North, a distinguished courtier during the reign of King James I, discovered the waters in 1606. Having lived a fashionably excessive lifestyle, he retired to the countryside (in nearby Eridge) in an unsuccessful attempt to repair his health. Travelling through woodland on his return to London, he discovered the waters and decided to try them. He found his health completely restored and lived to the age of 80.

With public interest aroused, Lord Abergavenny cleared the area of brushwood, sank wells and surrounded them with stone paving and railings. The waters subsequently attracted other visitors, who also claimed their health to be restored. Although few in number, due to the lack of accommodation nearby (at this time, the nearest being in Tunbridge (now Tonbridge), some 5 miles to the north), the visitors were of high social standing. They included Henrietta Maria of France, wife of King Charles I, six weeks after the birth of her son (later to become King Charles II) whose party camped in opulent tents erected at Bishops Down, due to the lack of nearby lodgings.

Originally referred to as Frant Wells, they were later renamed Queen Mary’s Wells, in honour of Queen Mary II and were only later given the present name of Tunbridge Wells.

The Upper and Lower Walks were created in 1638, when an existing bank of earth stretching south-west from the wells was levelled and planted with a double row of trees. Wooden buildings were constructed on both sides of the Walks.

===1660-1738: Post-Restoration===
The wells were neglected and almost forgotten during the English civil wars. It is following the Restoration, that several improvements were made to the immediate area, including construction of an assembly room and bowling green. In 1664, following a dangerous illness, the queen (Catherine of Braganza) was ordered to drink the waters, increasing their popularity.

In 1687, a fire destroyed the wooden buildings located on either side of the Walks. The buildings were later rebuilt with the colonnades which give the Pantiles its distinctive character today. By 1697, coffee houses had been developed in the area.

===1739 onwards: the Rusthall Manor Act===

The Rusthall Manor Act 1739 (13 Geo. 2. c. &quot;11&quot;) ensured that the Walks, the Wells and the Dipper&#x27;s Hall would be freely accessible to the public. It also prevented the building of any further buildings on Tunbridge Wells Common.

==Background to the name &quot;Pantiles&quot;==
* In 1700 the Upper Walks were paved with pantiles.
* On the 1738 map the area appears pretty much in its present form.
* In 1793 the pantiles were mostly removed and substituted with stone flagging – the region was then called The Parade.
* In 1887 the old name was revived.

The pantiles used to pave the Upper Walks should not be confused with roofing pantiles. The paving installed there comprised one-inch thick square tiles made from heavy wealden clay, so named because they were shaped in a wooden pan before firing.

Most of the Pantiles is listed: mostly built early to mid 19th century. No.7 is c.1660; 39-41 was formerly the Gloster Tavern; the Corn Exchange and Royal Victoria Hotel are both early 19th century.

==Events==
The Pantiles also hosts various festivals during the year including a food festival, a music festival featuring local bands, a fashion market and an open air art exhibition.

During the summer, the Pantiles hosts a summer jazz season, featuring evening outdoor jazz concerts on Thursday evenings where musicians play on the historic bandstand.

==Cultural references==
The Pantiles was used as a filming location for the 1967 musical &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; starring Tommy Steele and Julia Foster. In 1991 it was used as a backdrop for the band World Of Twist, on the cover of their debut album, Quality Street, with the group dressed in period costume. In 2007 it was used in a Christmas television advert for the Morrisons supermarket chain starring the singer Lulu. This caused some local discontent as Morrisons had only recently closed their Tunbridge Wells store. Morrisons returned to the Pantiles for their 2009 Christmas advert starring Richard Hammond and Denise van Outen. In 2021, the Pantiles was the backdrop for the televised christmas advert of the online retailer, Very.

<doc id="579778" wikidata="Q5771276" url="?curid=579778" title="Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet">
<text>Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet, PC (11 May 1799 – 9 September 1882) was a British Whig politician and a scion of the noble House of Grey. He held office under four Prime Ministers, Lord Melbourne, Lord John Russell, Lord Aberdeen, and Lord Palmerston, notably serving three times as Home Secretary for a collective 13 years.

==Background and education==
Grey was the eldest son of Sir George Grey, 1st Baronet, who was himself the third son of Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey, and younger brother of Prime Minister Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey. His mother was Mary Whitbread, daughter of Samuel Whitbread, an English brewer and Member of Parliament. He was born at Gibraltar, where is father was engaged as part of his naval command.

Grey was educated privately and at Oriel College, Oxford. Originally intending to become a priest, he instead chose law as his profession, and was called to the bar in 1826. He began a successful legal practice before entering politics.

==Political career, 1832–1853==
Grey was elected to parliament as a Whig for Devonport in 1832, and quickly made his mark in the House of Commons. He did not hold office in the Whig administration of his uncle Lord Grey, but when Lord Melbourne became prime minister in 1834, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. The government fell in December of that year, but returned to power in May 1835, when Grey resumed the post of Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies (succeeding William Ewart Gladstone). He retained this office until 1839, when he was made Judge Advocate General. The same year Grey was also admitted to the Privy Council. He was then briefly Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1841, with a seat in the cabinet for the first time until the Whigs were defeated in the general election that year.

The Whigs returned to power in July 1846 under Lord John Russell, who appointed Grey Home Secretary, the first of his three spells in this position. In 1846, Grey, &quot;himself a zealous advocate of hydropathy&quot; succeeded in getting passed The Baths and Washhouses Act, which promoted the voluntary establishment of public baths and washhouses in England and Wales. A series of statutes followed, which became known collectively as &quot;The Baths and Wash-houses Acts 1846 to 1896&quot;. This was an important milestone in the improvement of sanitary conditions and public health in those times. He decided to leave his seat at Devonport, partly owing to the baths scandal, returning instead for his native Northumberland North in an 1847 by-election, from the family seat at Fallodon, which he had recently inherited from his uncle, Henry Grey.

The new baronet sat throughout the parliament in active support of Lord John Russell, until the collapse of the ministry after the scandal of the Durham Letter, and controversial Ecclesiastical Titles bull. Traditional Whigs were Protestant, among them Grey, but the liberality of authorising a catholic hierarchy changed the nature of party politics. Grey&#x27;s first tenure at the Home Office notably saw him deal with relief efforts to the victims of the Great Famine of Ireland and trying to subdue the Irish rebellion of 1848. The latter year also saw the peak of the Chartist movement, which staged a massive rally in London in April. In 1847, Grey had left his old constituency in Devonport. He remained Home Secretary until the 1852 general election, when, despite enjoying widespread popularity, he lost his seat.

==Political career, 1853–1874==
Grey remained out of parliament until January 1853, when he was returned for Morpeth. He at first refused to join the coalition government of Lord Aberdeen, but in June 1854 he accepted the post of Colonial Secretary. The coalition fell in February 1855, and the Whigs returned to office under Lord Palmerston. Grey was appointed to his old office of Home Secretary, which he retained until the government resigned in February 1858. The Conservative administration under the Earl of Derby which took office only lasted until June the following year, when Palmerston again became prime minister. Grey was now appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but in 1861 he became Home Secretary for the third time. The government fell in 1866, and Grey was not to hold office again. Before the 1874 general election, he was overlooked as the Liberal candidate for Morpeth in favour of miners&#x27; leader Thomas Burt. This marked the end of Grey&#x27;s public life and he spent the remainder of his life in retirement at his Fallodon estate in Northumberland. In 1873 Grey took his grandson, Edward on a tour of Scotland. The train they were travelling in pulled in at the tiny village halt of Kingussie in the Highlands, where they were met on the platform by none other than William Gladstone.

==Family==
Grey married Anna Sophia Ryder, eldest daughter of Henry Ryder, Bishop of Lichfield, a son of the Earl of Harrowby. They had one son, George Henry Grey (1835–1874). As his only son had predeceased him, he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his grandson, Edward, who also became a prominent Liberal politician, serving as Foreign Secretary from 1905 to 1916, when he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Grey of Fallodon.

George Grey was an affectionate family man, a good sense of humour and quickness of mind. He was widely welcomed by a wide variety of friends. A devoted grandfather of seven, he often accompanied out riding, even until eighty years old. Ever an enthusiastic sportsman he encouraged his family to play tennis. He was a keen reader of the classics, with a great knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, Walter Scott&#x27;s poetry were part of their education. To the end he was conscientious of his children&#x27;s welfare. He died with them around him, aged eighty-three. His only son and heir was George Henry Grey. His eldest grandson Edward inherited the estate at Fallodon.

<doc id="579781" wikidata="Q906494" url="?curid=579781" title="Kaoliang liquor">
<text>Kaoliang liquor, Gaoliang liquor or Sorghum liquor is a strong distilled liquor of Chinese origin made from fermented sorghum. It is a type of light-aroma &quot;Baijiu&quot;. The liquor originates from Dazhigu (, located east of Tianjin), first appearing in the Ming Dynasty and is widely consumed across northern China in provinces such as Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shandong. It is primarily made and sold in China and Taiwan, but is also popular in Korea, where it is called &quot;goryangju&quot; (hangul: ; hanja: ) or &quot;bbaegal&quot; (which originates from the Chinese character ). Kaoliang ranges usually between 38 and 63 percent alcohol by volume. At present, world&#x27;s highest alcohol content of kaoliang liquor is up to 92% produced by Chyi Leh Wei Distillery () in Taiwan.

==Famous brands from Taiwan ==

Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor is one of the most popular brands of kaoliang in Taiwan. As its name indicates, it is produced on the island of Kinmen. The mainstays of the range are the standard 58 percent and 38 percent alcohol bottlings. Kinmen&#x27;s kaoliang production traces its roots back to the Chinese Civil War when Chinese nationalist general Hu Lien encouraged Kinmenese farmers to grow sorghum to produce hard liquor as importing alcohol from Taiwan caused financial strain. Kaoliang liquor has become an integral part of Kinmen&#x27;s economy and plays a significant role in the culture of Kinmen.

Yusan Kaoliang Chiew () is produced by the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation. It is named after the highest mountain in Taiwan, Yushan. One of the most notable products in the range is an &quot;X.O.&quot; kaoliang aged for five years in tanks before bottling.

Matsu Tunnel 88 Kaoliang Liquor () is produced by the Matsu Distillery in Nangan Township, Lienchiang County. The name is derived from the name of an abandoned military tunnel called Tunnel 88 which the distillery took over as storage space for their kaoliang and aged rice wine. All of the distillery&#x27;s aged kaoliangs are stored in the tunnel for at least five years.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1959 Masaki Kobayashi film &quot;The Human Condition I: No Greater Love&quot;, Chinese prisoners are said to be served a diet consisting of sorghum wine and soy pulp. 
* The 1987 Zhang Yimou film &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; is set in a rural &quot;kaoliang&quot; distillery in the Shandong province of China.
* The fictional character Li Kao, from Barry Hughart&#x27;s award-winning novels &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot;, and &quot;Eight Skilled Gentlemen&quot;, is named after &quot;kaoliang&quot;; his mother died in childbirth while requesting a last drink, and the abbot attending the birth mistook the syllables &quot;Kao...li...kao...&quot; as her intended name for the child. In &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, while telling the story of his birth, Li Kao describes kaoliang as &quot;the finest paint thinner and worst wine ever invented&quot;.
* Kaoliang is an important catalyst of the action in the story &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; in Taiwanese writer Pai Hsien-yung&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Taipei People&quot;.

<doc id="579790" wikidata="Q12053606" url="?curid=579790" title="British Rail Class 08">
<text>The British Rail Class 08 is a class of diesel–electric shunting locomotives built by British Railways (BR). As the standard BR general-purpose diesel shunter, the class became a familiar sight at major stations and freight yards. Since their introduction in 1952, however, the nature of rail traffic in Britain has changed considerably. Freight trains are now mostly fixed rakes of wagons, and passenger trains are mostly multiple units or have driving van trailers, neither requiring the attention of a shunting locomotive. Consequently, a large proportion of the class has been withdrawn from mainline use and stored, scrapped, exported or sold to industrial or heritage railways.

As of 2020, around 100 locomotives remained working on industrial sidings and on the main British railway network. On heritage railways, they have become particularly common, appearing on many of the preserved standard-gauge lines in Britain, with over 80 preserved, including the first one built.

==History==

The Class 08 design was based on the LMS 12033 series (later TOPS Class 11) design. There were also 26 of the near-identical but higher-geared Class 09, and 171 similar locomotives fitted with different engines and transmissions (some of which became Class 10), which together brought the total number of outwardly-similar machines to 1,193.

The pioneer locomotive, number 13000, was built in 1952 although it did not enter service until 1953. Production continued until 1962 with 996 locomotives produced, making it the most numerous of any British shunting locomotive class, and indeed, the most numerous of any British locomotive class overall.

The locomotives were built at the BR&#x27;s Crewe, Darlington, Derby, Doncaster and Horwich works.

In 1985, three locomotives were reduced in height for use on the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway in southwest Wales, and became Class 08/9. The remainder of the class were reclassified as sub-class 08/0. A further two were converted to 08/9s in 1987.

The first locomotive to be withdrawn was D3193 in 1967. Four other 08s were withdrawn before TOPS reclassification in 1973. Withdrawals continued in subsequent decades until by the beginning of the 1990s most of the class had been withdrawn. As part of the privatisation of British Rail in the mid-1990s most of the survivors passed to EWS with some going to passenger operators for use as depot shunters. At the same time as the withdrawals, many were purchased by heritage railways.
In mid-2008, EWS had over 40 class 08s in operation, with a greater number stored. Freightliner also had about five in operation, as did the locomotive company Wabtec. FirstGroup operated fewer than five; additionally, some work at industrial sidings – two for Foster Yeoman, one for Mendip Rail, one for Corus, one at ICI Wilton, two for English China Clays, amongst others. A few other businesses in the rail industry operated single examples.

===Exported locomotives===
Sixteen English Electric 0-6-0DE 350 hp locomotives, based on the Class 11/Class 08 design but modified for 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) gauge, were built new and exported 1951–53 to Australia, entering service on the Victorian Railways as the F class.

Five Class 08s were exported to Liberia, numbers 3047, 3092, 3094, 3098 and 3100. All five locos remain in Liberia and have been considerably robbed of parts in the intervening years.

In 2007, 08 738 and 08 939 were equipped for multiple operation at Toton TMD and repainted in Euro Cargo Rail livery before being sent to France in April 2009.

==Operations==

As the standard general-purpose diesel shunter on BR, almost any duty requiring shunting would involve a Class 08; thus the many locations where two portions of a train were merged, or where additional stock was added to a train, were hauled (briefly) by a Class 08, thus the class was a familiar sight at many major stations and terminals.

==Technical description==
The Class 08 design was based on the LMS 12033 series (later TOPS Class 11) design.

The engine is an English Electric (EE) 6 cylinder, 4-stroke, 6KT. Traction motors are two EE 506 motors with double reduction gear drive. The main generator is an EE 801.

In 1955, locomotives D3117 to D3122 entered traffic fitted with Crossley 6-cyl ESNT6 engines and two Crompton Parkinson traction motors. The same year, D3137 to D3151 entered service with Blackstone 6-cyl ER6T engines and GEC traction motors, as did D3439 to D3543, D3473 to D3502, DD3612 to D3651 and D4049 to D4094. Another batch, D3152 to D3166 had Blackstone engines but BTH traction motors.

== Design variations ==
There were variations on the basic design, which were given the following TOPS design codes:

=== Class 08/9 ===
Class 08/9 locomotives were modified from the standard class by being given headlights and cut-down bodywork in which the overall height was reduced to 11’ 10&quot; (3.61 m), for use on the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway up to . In 2007, three were used on infrastructure trains on the Manchester Metrolink.

===BR Class 13===

Six Class 08 units were adapted for a specialist role at Tinsley Marshalling Yard, where there was a requirement for more powerful shunters. These locomotives were permanently coupled together in pairs as a &#x27;master and slave&#x27; (the slave unit with its cab removed) and reclassified as Class 13. All were withdrawn by 1985.

==Fleet==
==Preservation==
Continuing in its designed-for role as a shunter, the Class 08 has been found useful by numerous heritage railways in the UK. With over 70 examples preserved, they are the second most numerous class of preserved locomotive in the UK.

== Models ==

Several manufacturers have produced models of Class 08 shunters. In OO scale, Wrenn, Tri-ang, Hornby Railways and Bachmann Branchline all produced models. Lima also produced a model in several different liveries, but it was of the near-identical Class 09.

Since 2000, both Bachmann Branchline and Hornby have released much more detailed models, in a variety of liveries and with a variety of appropriate detail variations.

In British N gauge, Graham Farish produced a relatively crude all-metal version, made in England, lacking outside frames and with a too-wide bonnet that was discontinued in 2007. A more detailed version with outside frames and a scale-width diecast bonnet was unveiled 2008 under the brand Graham Farish by Bachmann following the sale of the company.

<doc id="579792" wikidata="Q2633833" url="?curid=579792" title="Exeter House">
<text>Exeter House was an early 17th-century brick-built mansion, which stood in Full Street, Derby until 1854. Named for the Earls of Exeter, whose family owned the property until 1757, the house was notable for the stay of Charles Edward Stuart during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Exeter House was replaced by offices, which in turn were replaced by Charles Herbert Aslin&#x27;s Magistrates&#x27; Courts, built on the site during 1935. The courts were closed at the beginning of 2004, and after a decade vacant the building returned to use as an office development, Riverside Chambers.
This is where Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; or &quot;the Young Pretender&quot;) stayed, 4–6 December 1745. He dined with a widow, Mrs Ward; her son Samuel Ward (born 1732) acted as food taster for the Young Pretender.

On the morning of 5 December a council of war was called at Exeter House. The commander of the prince&#x27;s forces, Lord George Murray, argued that the lack of support from the French and from English Jacobites made success unlikely and retreat necessary. The prince was opposed to a retreat, and some members of the council objected strongly to giving up their advance on London. Meeting with the council again later in the day, the prince took the decision to retreat, and he left Exeter House the following morning. He gave Ward&#x27;s mother a diamond ring in thanks for their service before he left. The decision to retreat meant that the Young Pretender would not take George II&#x27;s crown and his army returned to Scotland, where they were finally defeated in 1746 at the Battle of Culloden.

After the death of the 8th Earl of Exeter in 1754, the house was sold in 1757 by his widow to John Bingham, Mayor of Derby for that year. Bingham lived at the house until his death in 1773 after which, in 1795, Jedediah Strutt purchased it. Strutt lived there until his death in 1797. The last owner was a lawyer, William Eaton Mousely, twice Mayor of Derby, who, after making some alterations in the 1830s, had the house demolished in 1854, believing Exeter House to be too large to maintain, and also to allow improvements to Exeter Bridge. A timber footbridge had been built by the Binghams of Exeter House to access their gardens on the other side of the River Derwent.

On visiting Exeter House in 1839 Lord Stanhope noted the drawing room on the first floor, the room in which the final council of war was held, as being &quot;…unaltered, it is all over wainscotted with ancient oak, very dark and handsome…&quot;. It was reached by a dark oak staircase, with carved balustrades. Another visitor, a Mrs. Thomson, described the house as standing back from Full Street within a small rectangular court. The wide staircase ascended from a small hall to the drawing room; on either side of the drawing room were small panelled rooms which had served as the bedrooms for the prince and his officers. A spacious drawing room on the ground floor (altered by Mousely) gave access to a long garden, enclosed between high walls, which led down to the riverside.

Mousely had intended to sell off the panelling from the house in separate lots. However an appeal by the MP for Derby Michael Thomas Bass, the Earl of Chesterfield and William Bemrose among others persuaded Mousely to call off the sales. The panelling of the drawing room was instead removed to the cellars of the Derby Assembly Rooms. It was later reassembled within Derby Museum and Art Gallery when the museum opened in 1879. In 2021 the exhibition of the Exeter Room in Derby was reconfigured and the mannequin of the prince was gifted to the Battle of Prestonpans [1745] Heritage Trust which displays it in the Museum &amp; Jacobite Heritage Centre at Prestonpans Town Hall.

<text>Georg von Békésy (, ; 3 June 1899 – 13 June 1972) was a Hungarian-American biophysicist.

By using strobe photography and silver flakes as a marker, he was able to observe that the basilar membrane moves like a surface wave when stimulated by sound. Because of the structure of the cochlea and the basilar membrane, different frequencies of sound cause the maximum amplitudes of the waves to occur at different places on the basilar membrane along the coil of the cochlea. High frequencies cause more vibration at the base of the cochlea while low frequencies create more vibration at the apex.

He concluded that his observations showed how different sound wave frequencies are locally dispersed before exciting different nerve fibers that lead from the cochlea to the brain.

In 1961, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the function of the cochlea in the mammalian hearing organ.

==Biography==

Békésy was born on 3 June 1899 in Budapest, Hungary, as the first of three children (György 1899, Lola 1901 and Miklós 1903) to Sándor Békésy (1860–1923), an economic diplomat, and to his mother Paula Mazaly.

The Békésy family was originally Reformed but converted to Catholicism. His mother, Paula Mazaly (1877–1974) was born in Szagolyca (now Čađavica, Croatia). His maternal grandfather was from Pécs. His father was born in Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania).

Békésy went to school in Budapest, Munich, and Zürich. He studied chemistry in Bern and received his PhD in physics on the subject: &quot;Fast way of determining molecular weight&quot; from the University of Budapest in 1926.

He then spent one year working in an engineering firm. He published his first paper on the pattern of vibrations of the inner ear in 1928. He was offered a position at Uppsala University by Róbert Bárány, which he declined because of the hard Swedish winters.

Before and during World War II, Békésy worked for the Hungarian Post Office (1923 to 1946), where he did research on telecommunications signal quality. This research led him to become interested in the workings of the ear. In 1946, he left Hungary to follow this line of research at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.

In 1947, he moved to the United States, working at Harvard University until 1966. In 1962 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. After his lab was destroyed by fire in 1965, he was invited to lead a research laboratory of sense organs in Honolulu, Hawaii. He became a professor at the University of Hawaii in 1966 and died in Honolulu.

He became a well-known expert in Asian art. He had a large collection which he donated to the Nobel Foundation in Sweden. His brother, Dr. Miklós Békésy (1903-1980), stayed in Hungary and became a famous agrobiologist who was awarded the Kossuth Prize.

==Research==
Békésy contributed most notably to our understanding of the mechanism by which sound frequencies are registered in the inner ear. He developed a method for dissecting the inner ear of human cadavers while leaving the cochlea partly intact. By using strobe photography and silver flakes as a marker, he was able to observe that the basilar membrane moves like a surface wave when stimulated by sound. Because of the structure of the cochlea and the basilar membrane, different frequencies of sound cause the maximum amplitudes of the waves to occur at different places on the basilar membrane along the coil of the cochlea. High frequencies cause more vibration at the base of the cochlea while low frequencies create more vibration at the apex.

Békésy concluded from these observations that by exciting different locations on the basilar membrane different sound wave frequencies excite different nerve fibers that lead from the cochlea to the brain. He theorized that, due to its placement along the cochlea, each sensory cell (hair cell) responds maximally to a specific frequency of sound (the so-called tonotopy). Békésy later developed a mechanical model of the cochlea, which confirmed the concept of frequency dispersion by the basilar membrane in the mammalian cochlea.

In an article published posthumously in 1974, Békésy reviewed progress in the field, remarking &quot;In time, I came to the conclusion that the dehydrated cats and the application of Fourier analysis to hearing problems became more and more a handicap for research in hearing,&quot; referring to the difficulties in getting animal preparations to behave as when alive, and the misleading common interpretations of Fourier analysis in hearing research.

==Awards==
Békésy&#x27;s honours include:
*The Denker Prize in Otology (1931), The Leibniz Medal of the Berlin Academy of Sciences (1937), The Guyot Prize for Speech and Otology of Groningen University (1939), The Academy Award of the Budapest Academy of Science (1946), Shambough Prize in Otology (1950).
*Honorary doctorates (M.D.) were conferred on him by the University of Munster (1955), Bern (1959), Padua (1962), Buenos Aires (1968), Cordoba (1968), Hawaii (1969) and Semmelweiss University, Budapest (1969).

<doc id="579801" wikidata="Q74574" url="?curid=579801" title="Fictional book">
<text>A fictional book is a text created specifically for a work in an imaginary narrative that is referred to, depicted, or excerpted in a story, book, film, or other work of fiction, and which exists only in one or more such works. A fictional book may be created to add realism or depth to a larger work of fiction. For example, George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; has excerpts from a book by Emmanuel Goldstein entitled &quot;The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism&quot; which provides background on concepts explored in the novel (both the named author [Goldstein] and the text on collectivism are made up by Orwell).

A fictional book may provide the basis of the plot of a story, a common thread in a series of books or other works, or the works of a particular writer or canon of work. An example of a fictional book that is part of the plot of another work (in addition to &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;) is Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, in which resistance members circulate a banned book entitled &quot;The Grasshopper Lies Heavy&quot;. An example of a fictional book linking a series is &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot;, an imaginary set of encyclopedias created by Isaac Asimov and referred to in the novels in his Foundation Series. An example of an author referring to a fictional book in a number of unconnected works is Jack Vance&#x27;s quotes from an imaginary twelve-volume opus entitled &quot;Life&quot; by Unspiek, Baron Bodissey in Vance&#x27;s novels (Bodissey is a fictional character created by Vance).

==Examples==
*The &quot;Necronomicon&quot; in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s books serves as a repository of recondite and evil knowledge in many of his works and the work of others. Despite the evident tongue-in-cheek origin of the book, supposedly written by the &quot;Mad Arab Abdul al-Hazred&quot;, who was supposed to have died by being torn apart by an invisible being in an Arab marketplace in broad daylight, many have been led to believe that the book is real.
*William Goldman&#x27;s &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is presented as an abridgment of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; by &quot;S. Morgenstern&quot;.
*The story of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; revolves around another mysterious and forbidden book, written by the title character (Hawthorne Abendsen), named &quot;The Grasshopper Lies Heavy&quot;. Dick&#x27;s book describes an alternate history where the Axis Powers were victorious in World War II and the United States has been divided between Japan and Nazi Germany. The book-within-a-book is an alternate history itself, depicting a world in which the Allies won the war but which is nonetheless different from our own world in several important respects. Towards the end of the story, Abendsen admits to writing &quot;The Grasshopper Lies Heavy&quot; under the direction of the &quot;I Ching&quot; (which influenced &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; as well).
*All of the stories in Robert W. Chambers&#x27; 1895 collection &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; feature a fictional play of the same name, which drives all readers mad and/or shows them another reality. Very little of the play is transcribed in the stories, although it is shown to be set in the kingdom of Carcosa, created by Ambrose Bierce.
*Guillaume Apollinaire&#x27;s short fiction &quot;L&#x27;Hérésiarque&quot; (&quot;The Heresiarch&quot; or &quot;The Heretic&quot;) describes two heretical Christian gospels written by the excommunicated Catholic cardinal Benedetto Orfei. Orfei&#x27;s heresy is that the three figures of the Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—were incarnate in Jesus&#x27; time, and were crucified alongside him. Orfei&#x27;s first work is &quot;The True Gospel,&quot; describing the human life of God the Father, an embodiment of virtue about whom little is known. Orfei&#x27;s second work describes the human life of God the Holy Spirit; the title of this work is not mentioned, but is referred to only as his &#x27;second gospel&#x27;. In this &#x27;gospel,&#x27; the Holy Spirit is a thief who willfully indulges in all manner of vice, including violating a sleeping virgin who then gives birth to Jesus Christ, or God the Son. Later, both the Holy Spirit and the Father are arrested as thieves and crucified, the latter unjustly. Orfei&#x27;s heresy is intended to illustrate man&#x27;s contradictory but coexistent aspects of sinner and martyr.
*Fictional books and authors figure prominently in several short stories by the Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges. A few of Borges&#x27;s fictional creations include &quot;The Book of Sand&quot;, Herbert Quain (author of &quot;April March,&quot; &quot;The Secret Mirror,&quot; etc.), Ts&#x27;ui Pen (author of &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;), Mir Bahadur Ali (author of &quot;The Approach to Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot;), as well as the imaginary &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; of the story &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;. In &quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the &quot;Quixote&quot;&quot;, a fictional poet named Pierre Menard attempts to recreate &quot;Don Quixote&quot; exactly as Miguel de Cervantes wrote it.
* Anthony Powell included over thirty fictional books in A Dance to the Music of Time.The books of fiction by fictional author, St. John Clarke, include &quot;Fields of Amaranth, Match Me Such Marvel, Dust Thou Art, The Heart is Highland, Never to the Philistines, E&#x27;en the Longest River,&quot; and &quot;Mimosa.&quot; Other fictional books are &quot;Death Head&#x27;s Swordsman&quot; and &quot;Profiles in String&quot; by the fictional author, X Trapnel and &quot;Pistons as Engine Melody&quot; by the fictional character, Kenneth Widmerpool. Writing about Powell&#x27;s fictional books, Robin Bynoe notes that there is a fictional bookcase of these works in the Powell papers.
* William Boyd includes the fictional novel, &quot;The Girl Factory&quot;, by Logan Mountstuart in his 2002 novel, Any Human Heart.
*Stanislaw Lem wrote several books containing methods and ideas similar to Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s fiction. Between &quot;One Human Minute&quot; and &quot;A Perfect Vacuum&quot;, he reviews 19 fictional books (and one fictional lecture). In &quot;Imaginary Magnitude&quot; there are several introductions to fictional works, as well as an advertisement for a fictional encyclopedia entitled &quot;Vestrand&#x27;s Extelopedia in 44 Magnetomes&quot;.
*In Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s &quot;Lullaby&quot;, the characters are searching for all the remaining copies of the book &quot;Poems and Rhymes Around the World&quot;, which contains a poem that can kill anyone who hears it spoken or has it thought in their direction.
* In Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s 1941 novel &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight&quot;, the titular writer-hero is responsible for the novels &quot;The Prismatic Bezel, Success,&quot; and &quot;The Doubtful Asphodel&quot;.
*The text of Mark Z. Danielewski&#x27;s novel &quot;House of Leaves&quot; consists largely of the fictional book &quot;The Navidson Record&quot; by Zampanò (possibly based on Jorge Luis Borges), and commentary upon it by its discoverer and editor Johnny Truant. &quot;The Navidson Record&quot; is itself an academic critique of an apparently nonexistent or fictional documentary film of the same name, which may or may not exist in the world of &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.
*Bill Watterson placed fictional children&#x27;s books in his comic strip &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, saying that he could never reveal their contents for they were surely more outrageous in the reader&#x27;s imagination. For several years, Calvin (perpetually six years old) demands that his father read him &quot;Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie&quot; as a bedtime story. Occasionally, his father&#x27;s patience snaps and he introduces new variations, which at least reveal what the original story is &quot;not&quot;: &quot;Do you think the townsfolk will ever find Hamster Huey&#x27;s head?&quot; An &quot;actual&quot; &quot;Hamster Huey&quot; book was written by Mabel Barr in 2004, years after the strip&#x27;s conclusion.
*&quot;Travels With My Cats,&quot; a Hugo-nominated short story by Mike Resnick first appearing in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; magazine, features a fictional travelogue of the same name.
*Paul Levinson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Plot To Save Socrates&quot; features a fictional ancient Platonic Dialogue, without title, that begins &quot;PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Socrates; Andros, a visitor. SCENE: The Prison of Socrates&quot;.
*The &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot; in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series was created in Terminus at the beginning of the Foundation Era. It serves primarily as an introduction to a character, a place or a circumstance to be developed in each chapter. Each quotation contains a copyright disclaimer and cites Terminus as the place of publication. The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; also makes an appearance in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams.
*&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; also features a fictional electronic guide book of the same name. The fictional book serves as &quot;the standard repository for all knowledge and wisdom&quot; for many members of the series&#x27; galaxy-spanning civilization. 
*&quot;The Magicians&quot; and its sequels, written by Lev Grossman, feature a fictional series &quot;Fillory and Further&quot; by fictional writer Christopher Plover. The series remain a major theme and a reference point throughout The Magicians&#x27; trilogy, even when the characters arrive in actual Fillory.
*The literary journal &quot;Underneath the Bunker&quot; (the title of which may refer to a song left off the track listing for the R.E.M. album &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot;), founded in 2002 and online since 2005, has followed Stanislav Lem and Borges in publishing reviews of books that have never existed, such as Tosca Calbirro&#x27;s &quot;Under An Unquiet Sun&quot;, or &quot;Receding Rainfall&quot; by the eccentric Bosnian novelist Hoçe.
*&quot;The Book of Counted Sorrows&quot; is a book invented by horror author Dean Koontz to add verisimilitude to some of his novels. &quot;Quotations&quot; from this fictional book were often used to set the tone of chapters of the novels. Koontz ultimately published a version of the book.
*The &quot;Anonymous Manuscript of XVII century&quot; which Alessandro Manzoni pretends to be translating in his novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot;
*The work and life of the elusive German novelist Benno von Archimboldi (a fictional character) is central to two of the five parts of &quot;2666&quot;, the last novel written by Roberto Bolaño. 
*&quot;Juan de Mairena&quot; is an apocryphal author, invented by the Spanish poet Antonio Machado. According to Machado, Juan de Mairena is the author of several books about aesthetic theory, one of which is called &quot;Arte Poética&quot; (Poetic Art). Machado devotes several essays to analyze the aesthetic ideas exposed by Mairena in &quot;Arte Poética&quot;.
*A version of the book of &quot;The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows&quot;, also known as the &quot;Book of the Nine Gates&quot; from the movie &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;. Inside each copy of the book were nine engravings, chapter pages, and Latin text with leather binding. &quot;The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows&quot; aka &quot;De Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis&quot; was written by Aristide Torchia in Venice, in 1666. The book contains nine woodcut engravings rumored to be copied from the apocryphal &quot;Delomelanicon&quot;, a book purportedly written by the Devil himself. &quot;The Nine Gates&quot; is said to contain within its pages knowledge to summon the Devil and assume great power. The author was burned, along with all his works in 1667. Three copies are known to survive.
*Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; starts with a chapter where the author pretends to have learnt the story he&#x27;s about to tell from an old manuscript that he translated. Additionally, most of the plot revolves around the search for an old book that might or might have not existed, the supposedly lost book of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics.&quot; The known part of this work talks about tragedy and its origins, while the lost part concerns comedy.

<text>The Rockwell-Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm X-31 is an experimental jet aircraft designed to test fighter thrust vectoring technology. It was designed and built by Rockwell and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB), as part of a joint United States and German &quot;Enhanced Fighter Maneuverability&quot; program to provide additional control authority in pitch and yaw, for significantly more maneuverability than most conventional fighters. An advanced flight control system provided controlled flight at high angles of attack where conventional aircraft would stall or lose control. Two aircraft were built, of which one has survived.

== Design and development ==
As the first international X-plane program, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was the US Government&#x27;s top-level management, with the US Navy serving as the military agent through Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). NASA supported the X-31 program through its Langley Research Center and Dryden Flight Research Center. The US Air Force Flight Test Center was a Participating Test Organization. 

The X-31 design was essentially an all-new airframe design, although it borrowed heavily on design elements and sometimes actual parts of previous production, prototype, and conceptual aircraft designs, including the British Aerospace Experimental Aircraft Programme (choice of wing type with canards, plus underfuselage intake), the German TKF-90 (wing planform concepts and underfuselage intake), F/A-18 Hornet (forebody, including cockpit, ejection seat, and canopy; electrical generators), F-16 Fighting Falcon (landing gear, fuel pump, rudder pedals, nosewheel tires, and emergency power unit), F-16XL (leading-edge flap drives), V-22 Osprey (control surface actuators), Cessna Citation (main landing gear&#x27;s wheels and brakes), F-20 Tigershark (hydrazine emergency air-start system, later replaced) and B-1 Lancer (spindles from its control vanes used for the canards). This was done on purpose, so that development time and risk would be reduced by using flight-qualified components. To reduce the cost of tooling for a production run of only two aircraft, Rockwell developed the &quot;fly-away tooling&quot; concept (perhaps the most successful spinoff of the program), whereby 15 fuselage frames were manufactured via CNC, tied together with a holding fixture, and attached to the factory floor with survey equipment. That assembly then became the tooling for the plane, which was built around it, thus &quot;flying away&quot; with its own tooling.

Two X-31s were built, with the first flying on October 11, 1990. Over 500 test flights were carried out from 1990 to 1995. The X-31 is a canard delta, a delta wing aircraft which uses canard foreplanes for primary pitch control, with secondary thrust-vectoring control. The canard delta had earlier been used on the Saab Viggen strike fighter, and has since become common on fighters such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale and Gripen which were all designed and flew several years before the X-31. The X-31 featured a cranked-delta wing (similar to the Saab 35 Draken and the F-16XL prototype), and fixed strakes along the aft fuselage, as well as a pair of movable computer-controlled canards to increase stability and maneuverability. Similar to a tailless aircraft, there are no moveable horizontal tail surfaces, only the vertical fin with rudder. Pitch and roll are controlled by the canard with the aid of the three paddles directing the exhaust (thrust vectoring). Eventually, simulations and flight tests on one of the X-31s showed that flight would be stable without the vertical fin, because the thrust-vectoring nozzle provided sufficient yaw and pitch control.

During flight testing, the X-31 aircraft established several milestones. On November 6, 1992, the X-31 achieved controlled flight at a 70° angle of attack. On April 29, 1993, the second X-31 successfully executed a rapid minimum-radius, 180° turn using a post-stall maneuver, flying well outside the range of angle of attack normal for conventional aircraft. This maneuver has been called the &quot;Herbst maneuver&quot; after Dr. Wolfgang Herbst, an MBB employee and proponent of using post-stall flight in air-to-air combat. Herbst was the designer of the Rockwell SNAKE, which formed the basis for the X-31.

In the mid-1990s, the program began to revitalize and so the US and Germany signed a Memorandum of Agreement in April 1999 to start collaboration on the VECTOR program to capitalize on this previous investment. The $53 million VECTOR program began in January 2000. VECTOR is a joint venture that includes the US Navy, Germany&#x27;s defense procurement agency BWB, Boeing&#x27;s Phantom Works, and DASA; it was initially expected to involve Sweden, which pulled out due to fiscal constraints. As the site for the flight testing, Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland was chosen. From 2002 to 2003, the X-31 flew extremely short takeoff and landing approaches first on a virtual runway at in the sky, to ensure that the Inertial Navigation System/Global Positioning System accurately guides the aircraft with the centimeter accuracy required for on the ground landings. The program then culminated in the first ever autonomous landing of a crewed aircraft with high angle of attack (24 degree) and short landing. The technologies involved a differential GPS System based on pseudolite technology from Integrinautics and a miniaturized flush air data system from Nordmicro.

=== Aircraft built ===
* BuNo 164584, 292 flights – crashed on January 19, 1995, north of Edwards AFB, California. The crash was caused by ice inside the pitot tube, sending incorrect airspeed data to the flight control computers. Contributing factors included the replacement of a heated pitot tube with an unheated Kiel probe, and ground crew/pilot ignorance of an option to override computer control. The pilot ejected safely. NASA issued in 2005 a film, &quot;X-31: Breaking the Chain&quot;, reviewing the events. The novelty of the X-31 trials was computer control of its revolutionary flight controls (canard wing and engine baffles) to effect maneuvers impossible for conventional jet fighters. The film discusses at length the combination of independent errors (e.g. that the accompanying chase pilot could not hear the test pilot&#x27;s radio conversation with his base) in prompting loss of control, when the test pilot (correctly) ejected to save his life. Film of the crash shows the aircraft in unusual attitudes as the computer applied its false data to attempt to control flight after the pilot ejected.
* BuNo 164585, 288 flights, the last one being in 2003. Put on permanent display at Deutsches Museum Flugwerft Schleissheim in Germany.

<text>Pembrokeshire Coast National Park () is a national park along the Pembrokeshire coast in west Wales.

It was established as a National Park in 1952. It is one of the three National parks of Wales, the others being the Brecon Beacons () and Snowdonia (). It is the only national park in the United Kingdom to consist largely of coastal landscapes.

==Landscape==
:&quot;See also Geology of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park&quot;

The National Park has a varied landscape of rugged cliffs, sandy beaches, wooded estuaries, wild inland hills, the moorland of the Preseli Hills and the wooded valley. The total area is . There are four distinct sections: clockwise these are the south Pembrokeshire coast, including Caldey Island; the estuary; the St Bride&#x27;s Bay coast, including the coastal islands; and the Preseli Hills.
The geology of the area is of particular interest with many good exposures both inland and along the coast, exhibiting a variety of rock types and structural features such as natural arches, stacks, rock folding and sea caves. A stack of note is Elegug Stacks (), two large detached pillars of limestone which in the spring provide valued nesting sites for razorbills and guillemots. In the north, the rocks of , and , together with the extensive moorland on and , give an exposed and mountainous feel to the landscape, cut through by the wooded valleys of the and Nevern. In the west, the National Park is dominated by the broad sweep of St Bride&#x27;s Bay, bounded at its northern end by Ramsey Island, near St David&#x27;s peninsula, and at its southern end by Skomer. The southern coast is another contrast, with the limestone plateau and cliffs of the Castlemartin peninsula, the steep-sided wooded valleys inland from Amroth; the Bosherston lakes — now, like much of the coastal strip, in the care of the National Trust — and the tourist resorts of Tenby and Saundersfoot. Between the western and southern areas of the National Park lies the Milford Haven waterway, where the tranquil estuary feeds into one of the finest natural deep water harbours in the world.
The National Park includes many sites (such as ) of historic and archaeological importance and areas which are of national or international nature conservation significance in their own right, including 7 Special Areas of Conservation, a Marine Nature Reserve, 6 national nature reserves and 75 Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

In 2011, &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; magazine voted Pembrokeshire the second best coastal destination in the world for sustainable tourism.

In January 2016 the Authority launched the &quot;Changing Coasts&quot; project to document the way the coastline has changed as a result of recent winter storms; the project invites visitors to submit photographs taken (at any time of day) from fixed points; a pilot study will be carried out at .

==Pembrokeshire Coast Path==

The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is a designated National Trail. It was established in 1970, and is long, much of it at cliff-top level, with a total of of ascent and descent.

The southern end of the path is at Amroth. The northern end was regarded as being at Poppit Sands, near St. Dogmaels, where the official plaque was sited; however, the path now continues to St. Dogmaels, where a new marker was unveiled in July 2009, and links with the Ceredigion Coast Path to continue northwards as part of the Wales Coast Path, the long-distance walking route around the whole coast of Wales from Chepstow to Queensferry, which was officially opened in 2012.

==Administration==
The Park is managed by Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, which has around 150 staff and a committee of 18 members. The Authority&#x27;s purposes are to conserve and enhance the National Park, and encourage the public to enjoy and understand it. In pursuing these purposes, the authority has a duty to foster the social and economic well-being of the communities within its boundaries. Its offices are in Pembroke Dock. The Chief Executive is Tegryn Jones.

The Authority also manages the entire length of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, a national trail which lies almost entirely within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.

In light of renaming of the other two Welsh national parks, the authority stated it plans to retains both its English and Welsh name in April 2023.

==Beaches==

Over the years Pembrokeshire&#x27;s beaches, all of which lie in the National Park, have been awarded many International Blue Flag Awards (10 in 2014), 47 Green Coast Awards (15 in 2011) and 106 Seaside Awards (31 in 2011). In 2011 it also had 39 beaches recommended by the Marine Conservation Society.

Beaches in the park include:
* Amroth
* Barafundle Bay
* Broad Haven
* Broad Haven South
* Freshwater East
* Freshwater West
* Manorbier
* Marloes
* Newgale
* Newport
* Poppit Sands
* Sandy Haven
* Saundersfoot

<text>Robert Adam Nisbet-Hamilton (1804 – 9 June 1877), known as Robert Dundas until 1835 and as Robert Christopher between 1835 and 1855, was a British Conservative Party politician. He served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster under the Earl of Derby between March and December 1852.

==Background==
Born Robert Dundas, he was the eldest son of Philip Dundas (c.1763–1807, the fourth son of Robert Dundas of Arniston, the younger), and Margaret (daughter of John Wedderburn of Ballendean (1729–1803) and sister of Sir David Wedderburn, 7th Baronet (1775–1858)).

He assumed the surname of Christopher in lieu of his patronymic in 1835 when his wife Lady Mary Bruce (see below) inherited the Christopher estates at Bloxholm and Wellvale in Lincolnshire. In 1855 he assumed the surname of Nisbet-Hamilton in lieu of Christopher after his wife succeeded to the Nisbet-Hamilton estates in Scotland, including Dirleton Castle and Archerfield House.

General Robert Manners left Bloxholm to his brother George, High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1826, whose death occurred in 1828. Both brothers having died unmarried, George left the estate to their dearest cousin, Mrs Jenney. She was the daughter of John, second Duke of Rutland, and sister of Lord Robert Manners, the father of Robert and George, making her their first cousin, once removed. However, Lady Mary Bruce, who was the brothers’ great niece, and eldest daughter of the 7th Earl of Elgin, contested the will, saying George had changed his will in her favour, and took the matter to court. A relative of the brothers wrote to the Editor of the &quot;Stamford Mercury&quot; on 26 March 1841 making it very clear that the family knew George wanted Bloxholm to go to Mrs Jenney, writing: &quot;for it is the opinion of all who are acquainted with the circumstances, that the testator would never have made an alteration had he been in the full possession of his faculties&quot;. The matter was settled in favour of Lady Mary Bruce.

==Political career==
After a successful electoral petition against the General Election result Nisbet-Hamilton was returned to Parliament for Ipswich in 1827, a seat he held until 1831 and again briefly in 1835. He also represented Edinburgh between 1831 and 1832 and North Lincolnshire between 1837 and 1857. When the Conservatives came to power under the Earl of Derby in 1852, Nisbet-Hamilton was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and sworn of the Privy Council. He remained as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster until the government fell in December 1852.

In 1833 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Family==
Nisbet-Hamilton married Lady Mary, daughter of General Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin and Mary, daughter and heiress of William Hamilton Nisbet, in 1828. They had one daughter. Nisbet-Hamilton died in June 1877, Lady Mary survived him by six years, dying in December 1883.

<text>Amateur sports are sports in which participants engage largely or entirely without remuneration. The distinction is made between amateur sporting participants and professional sporting participants, who are paid for the time they spend competing and training. In the majority of sports which feature professional players, the professionals will participate at a higher standard of play than amateur competitors, as they can train full-time without the stress of having another job. The majority of worldwide sporting participants are amateurs.

Sporting amateurism was a zealously guarded ideal in the 19th century, especially among the upper classes, but faced steady erosion throughout the 20th century with the continuing growth of pro sports and monetisation of amateur and collegiate sports, and is now strictly held as an ideal by fewer and fewer organisations governing sports, even as they maintain the word &quot;amateur&quot; in their titles.

==Background==

Modern organized sports developed in the 19th century, with the United Kingdom and the United States taking the lead. Sporting culture was especially strong in private schools and universities, and the upper and middle-class men who attended those institutions played as amateurs. Opportunities for working classes to participate in sport were restricted by their long six-day work weeks and Sunday Sabbatarianism. In the UK, the Factories Act 1844 gave working men half a day off, making the opportunity to take part in sport more widely available. Working class sportsmen found it hard to play top level sport due to having to turn up for work. On occasion, cash prizes, particularly in individual competitions, could make up the difference; some competitors also wagered on the outcomes of their matches. As professional teams developed, some clubs were willing to make &quot;broken time&quot; payments to players, &quot;i.e.&quot;, to pay top sportsmen to take time off work, and as attendances increased, paying men to concentrate on their sport full-time became feasible. Proponents of the amateur ideal deplored the influence of money and the effect it has on sports. It was claimed that it is in the interest of the professional to receive the highest amount of pay possible per unit of performance, not to perform to the highest standard possible where this does not bring additional benefit.

The middle and upper-class men who dominated the sporting establishment not only had a theoretical preference for amateurism, they also had a self-interest in blocking the professionalization of sport, which threatened to make it feasible for the working classes to compete against themselves with success. Working class sportsmen didn&#x27;t see why they shouldn&#x27;t be paid to play. Hence there were competing interests between those who wished sport to be open to all and those who feared that professionalism would destroy the &#x27;Corinthian spirit&#x27;. This conflict played out over the course of more than one hundred years. Some sports dealt with it relatively easily, such as golf, which decided in the late 19th century to tolerate competition between amateurs and professionals, while others were traumatized by the dilemma, and took generations to fully come to terms with professionalism even to a result of causing a breakdown in the sport (as in the case of rugby union and rugby league in 1895).

=== Corinthian ===
&quot;Corinthian&quot; has come to describe one of the most virtuous of amateur athletes—those for whom fairness and honor in competition is valued above victory or gain. The Corinthian Yacht Club (now the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club, RCYC) was established in Essex in 1872 with &quot;encouragement of Amateur Yacht sailing&quot; as its &quot;primary object&quot;. To that end, club rules ensured that crews consisted of amateurs, while &quot;no professional or paid hand is allowed to touch the tiller or in any way assist in steering.&quot; Although the RCYC website derives the name &quot;Corinthian&quot; from the Isthmian Games of ancient Corinth, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; derives the noun &quot;Corinthian&quot; from &quot;the proverbial wealth, luxury, and licentiousness of ancient Corinth&quot;, with senses developing from &quot;a wealthy man&quot; (attested in 1577) through &quot;a licentious man&quot; (1697) and &quot;a man of fashion about town&quot; (1819) to &quot;a wealthy amateur of sport who rides his own horses, steers his own yacht, etc&quot; (1823). Dixon Kemp wrote in &quot;A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing&quot; published in 1900, &quot;The term Corinthian half a century ago was commonly applied to the aristocratic patrons of sports, some of which, such as pugilism, are not now the fashion.&quot;

The &quot;Corinthian ideal&quot; of the gentleman amateur developed alongside muscular Christianity in late Victorian Britain, and has been analysed as a historical social phenomenon since the later 20th century. The Corinthian Football Club founded in 1882 was the paragon of this. In the United States, &quot;Corinthian&quot; came to be applied in particular to amateur yachtsman, and remains current as such and in the name of many yacht clubs; including Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club (founded 1874, added &quot;Corinthian&quot; to the name in 1881) and Yale Corinthian Yacht Club (likewise 1881 and 1893).

==Present day==

By the early 21st century the Olympic Games and all the major team sports accepted professional competitors. However, there are still some sports which maintain a distinction between amateur and professional status with separate competitive leagues. The most prominent of these are golf and boxing. In particular, only amateur boxers could compete at the Olympics up to 2016.

Problems can arise for amateur sportsmen when sponsors offer to help with an amateur&#x27;s playing expenses in the hope of striking lucrative endorsement deals with them in case they become professionals at a later date. This practice, dubbed &quot;shamateurism&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;sham&quot; and &quot;amateur&quot;, was present as early as in the 19th century. As financial and political stakes in high-level were becoming higher, shamateurism became all the more widespread, reaching its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, when the International Olympic Committee started moving towards acceptance of professional athletes. The advent of the state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateur athlete&quot; of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.

==North American collegiate athletics==


All North American university sports are (generally) conducted by amateurs. Even the most commercialized college sports, such as NCAA football and basketball, do not financially compensate competitors, although coaches and trainers generally are paid. College football coaches in Texas and other states are often the highest-paid state employees, with some drawing salaries of over five million US dollars annually. Athletic scholarship programs, unlike academic scholarship programs, cannot cover more than the cost of food, housing, tuition, and other university-related expenses.

In order to ensure that the rules are not circumvented, stringent rules restrict gift-giving during the recruitment process as well as during and even after a collegiate athlete&#x27;s career; college athletes also cannot endorse products, which somemay consider a violation of free speech rights. Former NBA player Jerome Williams says, &quot;For years, student-athletes, especially those from minority communities, have been disadvantaged from monetizing their image, or what we call &#x27;player intellectual property.&#x27; There&#x27;s an ongoing revenue stream college athletes are not a part of.&quot;

Some have criticized this system as exploitative; prominent university athletics programs are major commercial endeavors, and can easily rake in millions of dollars in profit during a successful season. College athletes spend a great deal of time &quot;working&quot; for the university, and earn nothing from it at the time aside from scholarships sometimes worth tens of thousands of dollars; basketball and football coaches, meanwhile, earn salaries that can compare with those of professional teams&#x27; coaches.

Supporters of the system say that college athletes can always make use of the education they earn as students if their athletic career doesn&#x27;t pan out, and that allowing universities to pay college athletes would rapidly lead to deterioration of the already-marginal academic focus of college athletics programs. They also point out that athletic scholarships allow many young men and women who would otherwise be unable to afford to go to college, or would not be accepted, to get a quality education. Also, most sports other than football and men&#x27;s basketball do not generate significant revenue for any school (and such teams are often essentially funded by football, basketball, and donations), so it may not be possible to pay athletes in all sports. Allowing pay in some sports but not others could result in the violation of U.S. laws such as Title IX.

==Olympics==

Through most of the 20th century the Olympics allowed only amateur athletes to participate and this amateur code was strictly enforced - Jim Thorpe was stripped of track and field medals for having taken expense money for playing baseball in 1912.

Later on, the nations of the Communist bloc entered teams of Olympians who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.

Near the end of the 1960s, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team&#x27;s full-time athletes and the other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues but met opposition from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional hockey players at the 1970 World Championships in Montreal and Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The decision was reversed in January 1970 after IOC President Avery Brundage said that ice hockey&#x27;s status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made. In response, Canada withdrew from all international ice hockey competitions and officials stated that they would not return until &quot;open competition&quot; was instituted. Günther Sabetzki became president of the IIHF in 1975 and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow &quot;open competition&quot; between all players in the World Championships. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics, because of the unwillingness of the NHL to take a break mid-season and the IOC&#x27;s amateur-only policy.

Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, a dispute formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted a rule that made any player who had signed an NHL contract but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, as long as they had not played in any NHL games. This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the World Hockey Association—were allowed to play. Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs. Murray Costello of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988, but let the individual sport federations decide if they wanted to allow professionals.

After the 1972 retirement of IOC President Avery Brundage, the Olympic amateurism rules were steadily relaxed, amounting only to technicalities and lip service, until being completely abandoned in the 1990s (In the United States, the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 prohibits national governing bodies from having more stringent standards of amateur status than required by international governing bodies of respective sports. The act caused the breakup of the Amateur Athletic Union as a wholesale sports governing body at the Olympic level).

Olympic regulations regarding amateur status of athletes were eventually abandoned in the 1990s with the exception of wrestling, where the amateur fight rules are used due to the fact that professional wrestling is largely staged with pre-determined outcomes. Starting from the 2016 Summer Olympics, professionals were allowed to compete in boxing, though amateur fight rules are still used for the tournament.

==Cricket==
===England===

English first-class cricket distinguished between amateur and professional cricketers until 1963. Teams below Test cricket level in England were normally, except in emergencies such as injuries, captained by amateurs. Notwithstanding this, sometimes there were ways found to give high performing &quot;amateurs&quot;, for example W.G. Grace, financial and other compensation such as employment.

On English overseas tours, some of which in the 19th century were arranged and led by professional cricketer-promoters such as James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury, a more pragmatic approach generally prevailed.

In England the division was reflected in, and for a long time reinforced by, the series of Gentlemen v Players matches between amateurs and professionals. Few cricketers changed their status, but there were some notable exceptions such as Wally Hammond who became (or was allowed to become) an amateur in 1938 so that he could captain England. Hammond was an example of &quot;shamateurism&quot;, in that he was offered a &quot;job&quot; which paid more than he earned as a professional cricketer to act as a company&#x27;s representative and play cricket. Amateurs touring abroad could claim more in expenses than professionals were paid. M.J.K. Smith was a well-salaried secretary - and an amateur captain - of Warwickshire County Cricket Club. Trevor Bailey at Essex and Reg Simpson at Nottinghamshire were in a similar situation.

Professionals were often expected to address amateurs, at least to their faces, as &quot;Mister&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot; whereas the amateurs often referred to professionals by their surnames. Newspaper reports often prefaced amateurs&#x27; names with &quot;Mr&quot; while professionals were referred to by surname, or sometimes surname and initials. At some grounds amateurs and professionals had separate dressing rooms and entered the playing arena through separate gates.

An anecdote narrated by Fred Root epitomises the difference between amateurs and professionals: In a match against Glamorgan, the batsmen, Arnold Dyson and Eddie Bates, had collided mid-pitch, and the ball was returned to Root, the bowler. Root didn&#x27;t break the stumps as both batsmen seemed injured. An amateur repeatedly shouted &quot;Break the wicket, Fred, break the wicket!&quot; until Root said: &quot;If you want to run him out, here&#x27;s the ball: you come and do it.&quot; The amateur responded with the words &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m an amateur. I can&#x27;t do such a thing.&quot;

After the Second World War the division was increasingly questioned. When Len Hutton was appointed as English national cricket captain in 1952 he remained a professional. In 1962 the division was removed, and all cricket players became known as &quot;cricketers&quot;.

===Other countries===

In Australia the amateur-professional division was rarely noticed in the years before World Series Cricket, as many top-level players expected to receive something for their efforts on the field: before World War I profit-sharing of tour proceeds was common. Australian cricketers touring England were considered amateurs and given the title &quot;Mr&quot; in newspaper reports.

Before the Partition of India some professionalism developed, but talented cricketers were often employed by wealthy princely or corporate patrons and thus retained a notional amateur status.

Women&#x27;s cricket has always been almost entirely amateur; however, the recent popularity of women&#x27;s sport has seen many top-level female cricketers become fully professional, with top international players earning up to $300,000 before endorsements and franchise contracts.

==Association football==

Boot money has been a phenomenon in amateur sport for centuries. The term &quot;boot money&quot; became popularised in the 1880s when it was not unusual for players to find half a crown (corresponding to 12½ pence after decimalisation) in their boots after a game.

The Football Association prohibited paying players until 1885, and this is referred to as the &quot;legalisation&quot; of professionalism because it was an amendment of the &quot;Laws of the Game&quot;. However, a maximum salary cap of twelve pounds a week for a player with outside employment and fifteen pounds a week for a player with no outside employment lingered until the 1960s, even as transfer fees reached over a hundred thousand pounds; again, &quot;boot money&quot; was seen as a way of topping up pay.

Today, the most prominent English football clubs that are not professional are semi-professional (paying part-time players more than the old maximum for top professionals). Until 2019, when it abandoned amateur status, the most prominent true amateur men&#x27;s club was probably Queen&#x27;s Park, the oldest football club in Scotland, founded in 1867 and with a home ground (Hampden Park) which is one of UEFA&#x27;s five-star stadia. They have also won the Scottish Cup more times than any club outside the Old Firm. Amateur football in both genders is now found mainly in small village and Sunday clubs and the Amateur Football Alliance.

===Soviet Union===
A peculiar situation took place in the Soviet Union which had Soviet-type economic planning in the country and no non-state enterprises were permitted. Existence of professional sports in the Soviet Union was considered to be amoral because no one must be involved in profiting from their body and/or skills and instead dedicate those to the state. In 1936 the government agency for sports adopted a decision to form competitions for &quot;teams of [football] masters&quot;, while at republican level (union republics) there were organized separate competitions among teams of factories and government agencies. Football players were officially on payrolls of a factory or a government agency which was represented in competition with its team. In this way athletes were officially getting paid as workers or officials. Athletes of the Soviet Armed Forces Sports Society or Dynamo Sports Club (NKVD sports society) carried a rank and a uniform. The difference between the teams of masters and other teams was the fact that the first competed at all-Union level and was known as non-amateur sports, while others at republican was considered to be amateur sports. The preceding football competitions among cities and regions were phased away.

==American football==
:&quot;See: American football in the United States#Adult amateur football and semi-pro football&quot;

==Sailing==
Around the turn of the 20th century, much of sailing was professionals paid by interested idle rich. Today, sailing, especially dinghy sailing, is an example of a sport which is still largely populated by amateurs. For example, in the recent Team Racing Worlds, and the American Team Racing Nationals, most of the sailors competing in the event were amateurs. While many competitive sailors are employed in businesses related to sailing (including sailmaking, naval architecture, boatbuilding and coaching), most are not compensated for their own competitions. In large keelboat racing, such as the Volvo Around the World Race and the America&#x27;s Cup, this amateur spirit has given way in recent years to large corporate sponsorships and paid crews.

==Figure skating==
Like other Olympic sports, figure skating used to have very strict amateur status rules. Over the years, these rules were relaxed to allow competitive skaters to receive token payments for performances in exhibitions (amid persistent rumors that they were receiving more money &quot;under the table&quot;), then to accept money for professional activities such as endorsements provided that the payments were made to trust funds rather than to the skaters themselves.

In 1992, trust funds were abolished, and the International Skating Union voted both to remove most restrictions on amateurism, and to allow skaters who had previously lost their amateur status to apply for reinstatement of their eligibility. A number of skaters, including Brian Boitano, Katarina Witt, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, and Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov, took advantage of the reinstatement rule to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics. However, when all of these skaters promptly returned to the pro circuit again, the ISU decided the reinstatement policy was a failure and it was discontinued in 1995.

Prize money at ISU competitions was introduced in 1995, paid by the sale of the television rights to those events. In addition to prize money, Olympic-eligible skaters may also earn money through appearance fees at shows and competitions, endorsements, movie and television contracts, coaching, and other &quot;professional&quot; activities, provided that their activities are approved by their national federations. The only activity that is strictly forbidden by the ISU is participating in unsanctioned &quot;pro&quot; competitions, which the ISU uses to maintain their monopoly status as the governing body in the sport.

Many people in the skating world still use &quot;turning pro&quot; as jargon to mean retiring from competitive skating, even though most top competitive skaters are already full-time professionals, and many skaters who retire from competition to concentrate on show skating or coaching do not actually lose their competition eligibility in the process.

==Rugby football==

===Background===
Rugby has provided one of the most visible and lasting examples of the tension between amateurism and professionalism during the development of nationally organised sports in Britain in the late-19th century. The split in rugby in 1895 between what became rugby league and rugby union arose as a direct result of a dispute over the pretence of a strict enforcement of its amateur status – clubs in Leeds and Bradford were fined after compensating players for missing work, whilst at the same time the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid.

Rugby football, despite its origins in the privileged English public schools, was a popular game throughout England by around 1880, including in the large working-class areas of the industrial north. However, as the then-amateur sport became increasingly popular and competitive, attracting large paying crowds, teams in such areas found it difficult to attract and retain good players. This was because physically fit local men needed to both work to earn a wage – limiting the time that they could devote to unpaid sport – and to avoid injuries that might prevent them working in the future. Certain teams faced with these circumstances wanted to pay so-called &#x27;broken time&#x27; money to their players to compensate them for missing paid work due to their playing commitments, but this contravened the amateur policy of the Rugby Football Union (RFU).

===Organization===
Following a lengthy dispute on this point during the early 1890s, representatives of more than 20 prominent northern rugby clubs met in Huddersfield in August 1895 to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU), a breakaway administrative body which would permit payments to be made to players. The NRFU initially adopted established RFU rules for the game itself, but soon introduced a number of changes, most obviously a switch from 15 to 13 players per side. It became the Rugby Football League in 1922, by which time the key differences in the two codes were well established, with the 13-a-side variant becoming known as rugby league.

The RFU took strong action against the clubs involved in the formation of the NRFU, all of whom were deemed to have forfeited their amateur status and therefore to have left the RFU. A similar interpretation was applied to all players who played either for or against such clubs, whether or not they themselves received any compensation. Such players were effectively barred &quot;sine die&quot; from any involvement in organised rugby union. These comprehensive and enduring sanctions, combined with the very localised nature of most rugby competition, meant that most northern clubs had little practical alternative but to affiliate with the NRFU in the first few years of its existence.

Rugby football in Britain therefore became subject to a de facto schism along regional - and to some extent class - lines, reflecting the historical origins of the split. Rugby league - in which professionalism was permitted - was predominant in northern England, particularly in industrial areas, and was viewed as a working class game. Rugby union - which remained amateur - was predominant in the rest of England, as well as in Wales and Scotland. Rugby union also had a more affluent reputation, although there are areas - notably in South Wales and in certain English cities such as Gloucester - with a strong working-class rugby union tradition.

===Discrimination===
Discrimination against rugby league players could verge on the petty - former Welsh international Fred Perrett was once excluded in lists of players who died in the First World War due to his &#x27;defection&#x27; to the league code. One Member of Parliament, David Hinchliffe, described it as &quot;one of the longest (and daftest) grievances in history&quot; with anyone over the age of 18 associated with rugby league being banned forever from rugby union.

===Scotland and Wales===
The Scottish Rugby Union was a particular bastion of amateurism and extreme care was taken to avoid the &#x27;taint&#x27; of professionalism: a player rejoining the national team after the end of the Second World War applied to be issued with a new shirt and was reminded that he had been &quot;supplied with a shirt prior to the outbreak of hostilities&quot;.

In Wales the position was more equivocal with clubs attempting to stem the tide of players &quot;going north&quot; with &quot;boot money&quot;, a reference to the practice of putting cash payments into player&#x27;s footwear whilst they were cleaning up after a game. Sometimes payments were substantial. Barry John was once asked why he hadn&#x27;t turned professional and responded, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t afford to.&quot;

===Open union===
Rugby union was declared &quot;open&quot; in August 1995 - almost exactly 100 years after the original split occurred - meaning that professionalism has been permitted in both rugby codes since that date. However, while the professional-amateur divide remained in force, there was originally very limited crossover between the two codes, the most obvious occasions being when top-class rugby union players &#x27;switched codes&#x27; to rugby league in order to play professionally. Welsh international Jonathan Davies was a high-profile example of this switch. Since professionalism has been allowed in rugby union the switches have started to come the opposite way. Union has swiftly grown to embrace the professional game with many league players joining union to take a slice of the larger amounts of money available in the sport.

Nowadays, while rugby union no longer makes the professional-amateur distinction, the professional-amateur split still exists within rugby league with the British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) strictly amateur, though it allows some ex-professionals to play provided they are no longer under contract. The most recent club to get a ban for fielding a contracted professional was Brighouse Rangers who were expelled from the National Conference League during 2007–2008 season, and the player handed a sine die ban (though in part for gouging ), although the club itself has since been admitted to the Pennine League.

Also, some rugby unions have amateur rules, most notably the Argentine Rugby Union, where all member clubs are amateur. The Campeonato Argentino, the national championship for provincial teams, does not include players contracted to the country&#x27;s Super Rugby side, the Jaguares.

==Ultimate and disc sports (Frisbee)==

Alternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a Frisbee. What started with a few players, in the sixties, like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and Ken Westerfield experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a Frisbee, later would become known as playing freestyle. Organized disc sports, in the 1970s, began with promotional efforts from Wham-O and Irwin Toy (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using Frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events. Disc sports such as freestyle, double disc court, guts, disc ultimate and disc golf became this sports first events. Two sports, the team sport of disc ultimate and disc golf are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi professionally. The World Flying Disc Federation, Professional Disc Golf Association, and the Freestyle Players Association, are the official rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide.

Disc ultimate is a team sport played with a flying disc. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to members of your own team, on a rectangular field, 120 yards (110m) by 40 yards (37m), until you have successfully completed a pass to a team member in the opposing team&#x27;s end zone. There are currently over five million people that play some form of organized ultimate in the US. Ultimate has started to be played semi-professionally with two newly formed leagues, the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) and Major League Ultimate (MLU).

The game of guts was invented by the Healy Brothers in the 1950s and developed at the International Frisbee Tournament (IFT) in Marquette, Michigan. The game of ultimate, the most widely played disc game, began in the late 1960s with Joel Silver and Jared Kass. In the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with the creation of the Ultimate Players Association with Dan Roddick, Tom Kennedy and Irv Kalb. Double disc court was invented and introduced in the early 1970s by Jim Palmeri. In 1974, freestyle competition was created and introduced by Ken Westerfield and Discrafts Jim Kenner. In 1976, the game of disc golf was standardized with targets called &quot;pole holes&quot; invented and developed by Wham-O&#x27;s Ed Headrick.

==High school sports==

Sports teams commonly exist at the high school level; who participate, commonly referred to as student athletes, do so during their course of study.

In the United States, each state has one or two high school sports associations, which are members of the National Federation of State High School Associations. Over 7 million high school students participate in athletics every year. Occasionally, sports success in high school sports may lead to a professional career in the field.

The benefit of sports in high school is debated; some believe that they promote discipline and teamwork, while others find that they can cause injury.
One study on the relationship between high school athletic and academic successes finds that, for the most part, higher participation and success rates in sports is positively related school-wide student successes on academic outcomes such as standardized test scores and educational attainment. The National Center for Educational Statistics reports that student athletes have a 20% higher chance of completing a college degree, and are more likely to be employed and in better health than non-athletes. However, a survey of high school athletes in 2006 showed that high school athletes are more likely to cheat inside of the classroom than non-athletes, especially boys participating in football, baseball, and basketball and girls participating in softball and basketball. The survey does not indicate to what extent cheating contributes to the greater academic outcomes of high school athletes.

In the world of middle school and high school sports, several fees have risen over the last few years making sports more expensive. The term &quot;Pay-to-Play&quot; means that students and their parents must pay a flat fee to participate, and that fee often leaves out the costs of uniforms, transportation, and other team fees. This affects low-income families (those who earn less than $60,000 per year) and their ability to participate in the sports. The average cost is $381 per child per sport (Pay-to-Play Sports). Physical and mental health can improve with the right amount of physical fitness incorporated into everyday life. It allows for the child to have a healthy developing body, and a BMI within the normal range. Physical activity has been proven to improve mood and decrease both stress and anxiety. Studies have shown that the more physical activity one participates in as a child, the happier and more stable that person will be as an adult. Thus, the more students who participate in school sports, the more students who will find themselves balanced and successful adults later in life.
In Japan, National High-school Baseball Tournament of Japan (全日本高等学校野球選手権), which highest of amateur sports of the Japan and world, that one of very interest in sports item for Japan, when held on every August, and also regional primary event held in every July on nationwide Japan, according to Central Institute Research of Japan (日本中央調査社) survey report on every years on past fifty years. This tournament was first held in 1914.

==Golf==
Golf still has amateur championships, most notably the U.S. Amateur Championship, British Amateur Championship, U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur, British Ladies Amateur, Walker Cup, Eisenhower Trophy, Curtis Cup and Espirito Santo Trophy. However, amateur golfers are far less known than players of professional golf tours such as the PGA Tour and European Tour. Still, a few amateurs are invited to compete in open events, such as the U.S. Open and British Open or non-open event, such as the Masters Tournament. Amateur golfers that win open tournaments may receive a trophy but are not entitled to any prize money above £700.
==Motorsport==
In motorsports, there are various forms of amateur drivers. When they compete at professional events, they are often referred to as &quot;pay drivers&quot;. They have been a presence in Formula One for many years - drivers such as Felipe Nasr, Esteban Gutiérrez and Rio Haryanto bring sponsorship to the tune of $30 million for a seat, even in backmarker teams. In sports car racing, drivers are often seeded into certain categories, including Amateur and Pro-Am classes. The vast majority of these &quot;gentlemen drivers&quot; however tend to participate at club level, often racing historic or classic cars, which are aimed primarily at amateurs.

==Other sports==
In Ireland, the Gaelic Athletic Association, or GAA, protects the amateur status of the country&#x27;s national sports, including Gaelic football, hurling and camogie. The GAA sees Croke Park, with a capacity of 82,300 people, filled for the Senior Football and Hurling Championship finals. Major tennis championships prohibited professionals until 1968, but the subsequent admission of professionals virtually eliminated amateurs from public visibility. Paying players was considered disreputable in baseball until 1869.

<text>Young, Gay and Proud is a book written for adolescents who are exploring a gay identity, published by an autonomous collective of the Melbourne Gay Teachers and Students Group. A new USA-edition was released in 1980, edited by Sasha Alyson and Lynne Yamaguchi Fletcher. The book has been banned by different public libraries. This book is based on a person called Jack Woodhouse.

In 1987, the Conservative government in the UK (under the rule of Margaret Thatcher) issued warning posters claiming that the Labour Party was issuing this book to be read in schools, as well as &quot;Police: Out of School&quot;, &quot;The Playbook for Kids About Sex&quot; (authored by Joani Blank), and &quot;The Milkman&#x27;s on his Way&quot; (authored by David Rees).

<text>William Charles Cole Claiborne ( 1773–1775 – November 23, 1817) was an American politician and military officer who served as the first governor of Louisiana from April 30, 1812 to December 16, 1816. He was also possibly the youngest member of the United States Congress in the history of the United States, although reliable sources differ about his age.

Claiborne supervised the transfer of Louisiana from French to U.S. control after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, governing the &quot;Territory of Orleans&quot; from 1804 to 1812, the year in which Louisiana became a state. He won the first election for Louisiana&#x27;s state Governor and served through 1816, for a total of thirteen years as Louisiana&#x27;s executive administrator. New Orleans served as the capital city during both the colonial period and the early statehood period.

==Early life and career==
Claiborne was born in Sussex County, Virginia, sometime between 1773 and 1775. His parents were Colonel William Claiborne and Mary Leigh Claiborne. He was a descendant of Colonel William Claiborne (1600–1677), an English pioneer who was born in Crayford, Kent, England, and settled in the Colony of Virginia.

Claiborne studied at the College of William and Mary, then Richmond Academy. At age 16 he moved to New York City, which was then the seat of U.S. Congress, where he worked as a clerk under John Beckley, the clerk of the United States House of Representatives. He moved to Philadelphia with the federal government. Claiborne then began to study law.

==Congressman from Tennessee==
In 1794 Claiborne moved to Tennessee to start a law practice. Governor John Sevier appointed Claiborne to the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1796. In 1797, he resigned his appointment to the court to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He won, and succeeded Andrew Jackson, though he was evidently not yet twenty-five years of age as required by the Constitution. Earlier in 1797, he described his age to George Washington in vague terms: &quot;Born, Sir, at a period, when every American Breast palpitated for freedom, I became early attached to civil Liberty. ...&quot;

Claiborne took his seat in the House on November 23, 1797. State records indicate that, when he took his seat, he was 24. Other sources suggest he was 22. His gravestone says he was 23.

Claiborne served in the House through 1801. The United States presidential election of 1800 was decided in the House of Representatives, due to a tie in the Electoral College, by which time Claiborne was over 25 years old.

==Service in Mississippi Territory==
Claiborne was appointed governor and superintendent of Indian affairs in the Mississippi Territory, from 1801 to 1803. Although he favored acquiring some land from the Choctaw and Chickasaw, Claiborne was generally sympathetic and conciliatory toward Indians. He worked long and patiently to iron out differences that arose, and to improve the material well-being of the Indians.

Claiborne was also partly successful in promoting the establishment of law and order in the region. From 1803 to 1804, he offered a two-thousand dollar reward to eliminate, once and for all, a gang of outlaws headed by the notorious Samuel Mason.

Though he looked out for his constituents, his positions on issues indicated a national rather than regional focus. Claiborne expressed the philosophy of the Democratic-Republican Party and helped that party defeat the Federalists.

When a smallpox epidemic broke out in the spring of 1802, Claiborne&#x27;s actions resulted in the first recorded mass vaccination in the territory and saved the city of Natchez from the disease.

== Louisiana territorial period ==
Claiborne moved to New Orleans and oversaw the transfer of Louisiana to U.S. control after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Local French and Spanish inhabitants saw it for what it was, a military occupation that they resented and quoted in their &quot;remonstrances&quot; and meetings that they were no more than conquered subjects who had not been consulted. He governed what would become the state of Louisiana, then termed the &quot;Territory of Orleans&quot;, during its period as a United States territory from 1804 until 1812.

Relations with Louisiana&#x27;s Créole population were initially rather strained: Claiborne was young, inexperienced, and unsure of himself, and at the time of his arrival spoke no French. The white elite were initially alarmed when Claiborne retained the services of free people of color in the militia, who had served with considerable distinction during the preceding forty-year Spanish rule. Claiborne bestowed a ceremonial flag and &#x27;colors&#x27; on the battalion, an act which would enmesh him in a duel three years later.

The duel was held in then-Spanish territory, near the current Houmas House plantation, with his arch-enemy Daniel Clark. On June 8, 1807, the Governor was shot through one thigh, with the bullet lodging in the other leg. Claiborne gradually gained the confidence of the French elite and oversaw the taking in of Francophone refugees from the Haitian Revolution.

An event which is now said to have been the largest slave rebellion in U.S. history, the 1811 German Coast Uprising, occurred while Claiborne was the territorial governor. However, the American government, over which he presided, had little participation in its suppression. The parish courts, dominated by wealthy planters, imposed quick convictions and sentencing of the black slaves who had survived the fighting. U.S. military personnel arrived too late to capture the rebels or to prevent what amounted to their massacre at the hands of American militiamen or white planters who lived along the Mississippi River.

Claiborne himself wrote at least twice to parish officials to request that they refer cases to him for executive pardon or clemency, rather than accept the wholesale death sentences that were being handed out in Orleans Parish, as well as in St. Charles Parish and St. John the Baptist Parish. The only known beneficiaries of his pardon were two men named Theodore and Henry, but no records exist of Claiborne refusing any other pardon requests related to the rebellion.

After the Republic of West Florida won a short-lived period of independence (from Spain) in 1810, Claiborne annexed the area to the Orleans Territory on the orders of President James Madison, who determined to consider it as part of the Louisiana Purchase.

== After Louisiana statehood ==
Claiborne was the first elected governor after Louisiana became a U.S. state, winning the election of 1812 against Jacques Villeré, and serving from 1812 through 1816. On the eve of the War of 1812 he sent interpreter Simon Favre to the Choctaws to attempt to keep them out of the war. Claiborne raised militia companies and in 1814 negotiated the assistance of French pirate and slave trader Jean Lafitte in defending New Orleans from an expected British attack.

After the attack occurred in 1815, Claiborne wrote to Major-General John Lambert on March 25, informing him that two &quot;distinguished citizens&quot; of Louisiana, Michael Fortier and Chevalier de la Croix, had gone to his headquarters to Dauphin Island to retrieve fugitive slaves who had fled to the British Army and gained their freedom. Lambert&#x27;s subordinate, John Power, replied to Claiborne on March 30, stating that &quot;I should feel happy, in rendering any assistance to those Gentlemen, to enable them to execute the object of their mission, but agreeable to the determination of Major General Lambert... he did not feel himself authorized to resort to force, to oblige them [to return to their enslavers], as they threw themselves on his protection, which they were entitled to, having served with the British Army and which they did voluntarily and without compulsion&quot;.

After his term as governor, Claiborne was elected to the United States Senate, serving from March 4, 1817, until his death on November 23, 1817, which was 20 years to the day after his first day in Congress.

==Death and legacy==
Claiborne died on November 23, 1817. The &quot;Louisiana Courier&quot; attributed Claiborne&#x27;s demise to a &quot;liver ailment&quot;. Claiborne was buried at the St. Louis Cemetery Number 1, in New Orleans, then the most prestigious of the city&#x27;s cemeteries. This was a controversial honor, as it is a Roman Catholic cemetery, while Claiborne was Protestant. He was later re-interred at the Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.

Claiborne Parish, Louisiana, was named in his honor as were two U.S. counties: Claiborne County, Mississippi; and Claiborne County, Tennessee. The longest street in New Orleans was named in his honor: Claiborne Avenue.

The Supreme Court case &quot;Claiborne v. Police Jury&quot; established the three distinct governing structures of the U.S. in Louisiana. The decision was only made after Claiborne&#x27;s death.

The World War II Camp Claiborne was named for him in 1939. This installation is still used today for training the Louisiana Army National Guard, particularly by the 256th Infantry Brigade for road marches and land navigation.

The Claiborne Building is located in downtown Baton Rouge and serves as an administrative center for the Louisiana state government.

In 1993, Claiborne was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. He was among the first thirteen inductees into the Hall of Fame.

==Family life and descendants==
Claiborne&#x27;s first two wives, Eliza Wilson Lewis, daughter of William Terrell Lewis of Tennessee, and Marie Clarisse Duralde, daughter of Martin Duralde, died of yellow fever in New Orleans, within five years of each other. The child of the first marriage, a little girl named Cornelia Tennessee Claiborne, died the same day as her mother. The second marriage produced a son, William C. C. Claiborne, Jr.

In 1812, Governor Claiborne married a third time, to Suzette Bosque, daughter of Don Bartólome Bosque, a Spanish colonial official. Their child was Sophronië (or Sophronia) Louise Claiborne, who married Antoine James de Marigny, son of Bernard de Marigny.

William Claiborne was the great-great-great-grandfather of fashion designer Liz Claiborne. He was also the great-great-great-grandfather of Liz Claiborne&#x27;s brother Carol Louis Fenner Claiborne, who served as an Assistant District Attorney of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, an Assistant Solicitor General of the United States in Washington, D.C. and who became a Barrister in England after that. 

Claiborne was related to numerous individuals who served in Congress over several generations. He was the brother of Nathaniel Herbert Claiborne, nephew of Thomas Claiborne, uncle of John Francis Hamtramck Claiborne, granduncle of James Robert Claiborne, great-great-great-granduncle of Lindy Boggs, and great-great-great-granduncle of Claiborne Pell.

<text>Edward Strutt, 1st Baron Belper PC FRS (26 October 1801 – 30 June 1880), was a British Whig Party politician. He served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1852 to 1854 under Lord Aberdeen.

==Background and education==
Born at St Helen&#x27;s House Derby, Strutt was the only son of William Strutt, of St Helen&#x27;s House, Derbyshire, and the grandson of Jedediah Strutt. His mother was Barbara, daughter of Thomas Evans.

He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union in 1821. Strutt graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1823, promoted to Master of Arts three years later.
==Political career==
Strutt entered the British House of Commons in 1830, sitting as Member of Parliament for Derby until 1848, when he was unseated on petition. He represented Arundel from 1851 to 1852 and Nottingham from 1852 to 1856. He was Chief Commissioner of Railways between 1846 and 1848 and served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1853 to 1854 in Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s coalition government. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1846 and in 1856 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Belper, of Belper, in the County of Derby.

Strutt also held the honorary posts of High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1850 and Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire between 1864 and 1880, having been previously a Deputy Lieutenant. In 1860 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and between 1871 and 1879, he was President of University College, London.

==Family==

Lord Belper married Amelia Harriet Otter, daughter of the Right Reverend William Otter, Bishop of Chichester, on 28 March 1837. They had several children. They were the parents of Henry Strutt, 2nd Baron Belper.

Children from the marriage were:
*Caroline Strutt (d. 23 July 1926) married Sir Kenelm Edward Digby, son of Kenelm Henry Digby and Caroline Sheppard, on 30 August 1870.
*Ellen Strutt (d. 31 December 1940) married George Murray Smith the Younger on 22 October 1885.
*Sophia Strutt (d. 2 December 1928) married Sir Henry Denis Le Marchant, 2nd Baronet., son of Sir Denis Le Marchant, 1st Baronet, on 7 September 1869.
*William Strutt (7 May 1838 – 19 January 1856) died in Bonn, Germany.
*Henry Strutt, 2nd Baron Belper (20 May 1840 – 26 July 1914)
*Arthur Strutt (3 Mar 1842 – 6 February 1877) married Alice Mary Elizabeth March Phillipps de Lisle, daughter of Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps De Lisle and Laura Maria Clifford, on 22 April 1873.
He built his family seat, Kingston Hall, Nottinghamshire and moved in 1846.

Lord Belper died at Eaton Square, Belgravia, London, in June 1880, aged 78, and was succeeded in the barony by his second but eldest surviving son, Henry. A stained glass window was erected in the north side of the chancel in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Nottingham in his memory. Lady Belper died in December 1890.

<text>The New Forest is one of the largest remaining tracts of unenclosed pasture land, heathland and forest in Southern England, covering southwest Hampshire and southeast Wiltshire. It was proclaimed a royal forest by William the Conqueror, featuring in the Domesday Book.

It is the home of the New Forest Commoners, whose ancient rights of common pasture are still recognised and exercised, enforced by official verderers and agisters. In the 18th century, the New Forest became a source of timber for the Royal Navy. It remains a habitat for many rare birds and mammals.

The boundaries of the forest have varied over time and depend on the purpose of delimiting them. It is a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Several areas are Geological Conservation Review sites, including Mark Ash Wood, Shepherd’s Gutter, Cranes Moor, Studley Wood, and Wood Green. There are also a number of Nature Conservation Review sites. It is a Special Area of Conservation, a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area. Copythorne Common is managed by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, Kingston Great Common is a national nature reserve and New Forest Northern Commons is managed by the National Trust.

== Prehistory ==
Like much of England, the site of the New Forest was once deciduous woodland, recolonised by birch and eventually beech and oak after the withdrawal of the ice sheets starting around 12,000 years ago. Some areas were cleared for cultivation from the Bronze Age onwards; the poor quality of the soil in the New Forest meant that the cleared areas turned into heathland &quot;waste&quot;, which may have been used even then as grazing land for horses.

There was still a significant amount of woodland in this part of Britain, but this was gradually reduced, particularly towards the end of the Middle Iron Age around 250–100 BC, and most importantly the 12th and 13th centuries, and of this essentially all that remains today is the New Forest.

There are around 250 round barrows within its boundaries, and scattered boiling mounds, and it also includes about 150 scheduled monuments. One may be the only known inhumation site of the Early Iron Age and the only known Hallstatt culture burial place in Britain, though any bodies are likely decomposed beyond detection by the acidic soil.

==History==

Following Anglo-Saxon settlement in Britain, according to Florence of Worcester (d. 1118), the area became the site of the Jutish kingdom of &quot;Ytene&quot;; this name was the genitive plural of &quot;Yt&quot; meaning &quot;Jute&quot;, i.e. &quot;of the Jutes&quot;. The Jutes were one of the early Anglo-Saxon tribal groups who colonised this area of southern Hampshire.

Following the Norman Conquest, the New Forest was proclaimed a royal forest, in about 1079, by William the Conqueror. It was used for royal hunts, mainly of deer. It was created at the expense of more than 20 small hamlets and isolated farmsteads; hence it was then &#x27;new&#x27; as a single compact area.

The New Forest was first recorded as &quot;Nova Foresta&quot; in Domesday Book in 1086, where a section devoted to it is interpolated between lands of the king&#x27;s thegns and the town of Southampton; it is the only forest that the book describes in detail. Twelfth-century chroniclers alleged that William had created the forest by evicting the inhabitants of 36 parishes, reducing a flourishing district to a wasteland; this account is thought dubious by most historians, as the poor soil in much of the area is believed to have been incapable of supporting large-scale agriculture, and significant areas appear to have always been uninhabited.

Two of William&#x27;s sons died in the forest: Prince Richard sometime between 1069 and 1075, and King William II (William Rufus) in 1100. Though many claim the latter is due to an inaccurate arrow shot from his hunting companion, local folklore asserted that this was punishment for the crimes committed by William when he created his New Forest; 17th-century writer Richard Blome provides detail:

In this County [Hantshire] is New-Forest, formerly called Ytene, being about 30 miles in compass; in which said tract William the Conqueror (for the making of the said Forest a harbour for Wild-beasts for his Game) caused 36 Parish Churches, with all the Houses thereto belonging, to be pulled down, and the poor Inhabitants left succourless of house or home. But this wicked act did not long go unpunished, for his Sons felt the smart thereof; Richard being blasted with a pestilent Air; Rufus shot through with an Arrow; and Henry his Grand-child, by Robert his eldest son, as he pursued his Game, was hanged among the boughs, and so dyed. This Forest at present affordeth great variety of Game, where his Majesty oft-times withdraws himself for his divertisement. 

The reputed spot of Rufus&#x27;s death is marked with a stone known as the Rufus Stone.
John White, Bishop of Winchester, said of the forest:

From God and Saint King Rufus did Churches take, From Citizens town-court, and mercate place, From Farmer lands: New Forrest for to make, In Beaulew tract, where whiles the King in chase Pursues the hart, just vengeance comes apace, And King pursues. Tirrell him seing not, Unwares him flew with dint of arrow shot. 

The common rights were confirmed by statute in 1698. The New Forest became a source of timber for the Royal Navy, and plantations were created in the 18th century for this purpose. During the Great Storm of 1703, about 4,000 oak trees were lost.

The naval plantations encroached on the rights of the Commoners, but the Forest gained new protection under the New Forest Act 1877, which confirmed the historic rights of the Commoners and entrenched that the total of enclosures was henceforth not to exceed at any time. It also reconstituted the Court of Verderers as representatives of the Commoners (rather than the Crown).

, roughly 90% of the New Forest is still owned by the Crown. The Crown lands have been managed by Forestry England since 1923 and most of the Crown lands now fall inside the new National Park.

Felling of broadleaved trees, and their replacement by conifers, began during the First World War to meet the wartime demand for wood. Further encroachments were made during the Second World War. This process is today being reversed in places, with some plantations being returned to heathland or broadleaved woodland. Rhododendron remains a problem.

During the Second World War, an area of the forest, Ashley Range, was used as a bombing range. The Beaulieu, Hampshire estate of Lord Montagu in the New Forest was the site of group B finishing schools for agents operated by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) between 1941 and 1945. (One of the trainers was Kim Philby who was later found to be part of a spy ring passing information to the Soviets.) In 2005, a special exhibition was mounted at the estate, with a video showing photographs from that era as well as voice recordings of former SOE trainers and agents.

Further New Forest Acts followed in 1949, 1964 and 1970. The New Forest became a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1971, and was granted special status as the New Forest Heritage Area in 1985, with additional planning controls added in 1992. The New Forest was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June 1999, but UNESCO did not take up the nomination. It became a National Park on 1 March 2005, transferring a wide variety of planning and control decisions to the New Forest National Park Authority, who work alongside the local authorities, land owners and crown estates in managing the New Forest.

A report in 2023 stated that the region will face hotter, drier summers and wetter winters. In 2019, the carbon dioxide emissions of the New Forest District Council area were recorded as 928,000 tonnes.
== Common rights ==
Forest laws were enacted to preserve the New Forest as a location for royal deer hunting, and interference with the king&#x27;s deer and its forage was punished. The inhabitants of the area (&quot;commoners&quot;) had pre-existing &quot;rights of common&quot;: to turn horses and cattle (but only rarely sheep) out into the Forest to graze (&quot;common pasture&quot;), to gather fuel wood (&quot;estovers&quot;), to cut peat for fuel (&quot;turbary&quot;), to dig clay (&quot;marl&quot;), and to turn out pigs between September and November to eat fallen acorns and beechnuts (&quot;pannage&quot; or &quot;mast&quot;). There were also licences granted to gather bracken after Michaelmas Day (29 September) as litter for animals (&quot;fern&quot;).

Along with grazing, pannage is still an important part of the Forest&#x27;s ecology. Pigs can eat acorns without problem, but for ponies and cattle, large quantities of acorns can be poisonous. Pannage always lasts at least 60 days, but the start date varies according to the weather – and when the acorns fall. The verderers decide when pannage will start each year. At other times the pigs must be taken in and kept on the owner&#x27;s land, with the exception that pregnant sows, known as &quot;privileged sows&quot;, are always allowed out providing they are not a nuisance and return to the Commoner&#x27;s holding at night (they must not be &quot;&quot;levant&quot; and &quot;couchant&quot;&quot; in the Forest, that is, they may not consecutively feed &quot;and&quot; sleep there). This last is an established practice rather than a formal right.

The principle of levancy and couchancy applies generally to the right of pasture. Commoners must have backup land, outside the Forest, to accommodate these depastured animals when necessary, for example during a foot-and-mouth disease epidemic.

Commons rights are attached to particular plots of land (or in the case of turbary, to particular hearths), and different land has different rights – and some of this land is some distance from the Forest itself. Rights to graze ponies and cattle are not for a fixed number of animals, as is often the case on other commons. Instead a &quot;marking fee&quot; is paid for each animal each year by the owner. The marked animal&#x27;s tail is trimmed by the local agister (verderers&#x27; official), with each of the four or five forest agisters using a different trimming pattern. Ponies are branded with the owner&#x27;s brand mark; cattle may be branded, or nowadays may have the brand mark on an ear tag. Grazing of Commoners&#x27; ponies and cattle is an essential part of the management of the forest, helping to maintain the heathland, bog, grassland and wood-pasture habitats and their associated wildlife.

Recently this ancient practice has come under pressure as houses that benefit from forest rights pass to owners with no interest in commoning. Existing families with a new generation heavily rely on inheritance of, rather than the (mostly expensive) purchase of, a benefiting house with paddock or farm.

The Verderers and Commoners&#x27; Defence Association has fought back against these allied economic threats. The EU Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) helped some Commoners significantly. Commoners marking animals for grazing can claim about £200 per cow per year, and about £160 for a pony, and more if participating in the stewardship scheme. With 10 cattle and 40 ponies, a Commoner qualifying for both schemes would receive over £8,000 a year, and more if they also put out pigs: net of marking fees, feed and veterinary costs this part-time level of involvement across a family is calculated to give an annual income in the thousands of pounds in most years. Whether those subsidies will survive Brexit is unclear. The BPS payment was based on the number of animals marked for the Forest, whether or not these are actually turned out. The livestock actually grazing the Forest are therefore considerably fewer than those marked.

== Geography ==

The New Forest National Park area covers , and the New Forest SSSI covers almost , making it the largest contiguous area of unsown vegetation in lowland Britain. It includes roughly:
* of broadleaved woodland
* of heathland and grassland
* of wet heathland
* of tree plantations (&quot;woodland inclosures&quot;) established since the 18th century, including planted by Forestry England since the 1920s.

The New Forest has also been classed as National Character Area No. 131 by Natural England. The NCA covers an area of and is bounded by the Dorset Heaths and Dorset Downs to the west, the West Wiltshire Downs to the north and the South Hampshire Lowlands and South Coast Plain to the east.

The New Forest is drained to the south by three rivers, Lymington River, Beaulieu River and Avon Water, and to the west by the Latchmore Brook, Dockens Water, Linford Brook and other streams.

The highest point in the New Forest is Pipers Wait, near Nomansland. Its summit is above sea level.

The geology of the New Forest consists mainly of sedimentary rock, in the centre of a sedimentary basin known as the Hampshire Basin.

== Wildlife ==
The ecological value of the New Forest is enhanced by the relatively large areas of lowland habitats, lost elsewhere, which have survived. There are several kinds of important lowland habitat including valley bogs, alder carr, wet heaths, dry heaths and deciduous woodland. The area contains a profusion of rare wildlife, including the New Forest cicada &quot;Cicadetta montana&quot;, the only cicada native to Great Britain, although the last unconfirmed sighting was in 2000. The wet heaths are important for rare plants, such as marsh gentian (&quot;Gentiana pneumonanthe&quot;) and marsh clubmoss (&quot;Lycopodiella inundata&quot;) and other important species include the wild gladiolus (&quot;Gladiolus illyricus&quot;).

Several species of sundew are found, as well as many unusual insect species, including the southern damselfly (&quot;Coenagrion mercuriale&quot;), large marsh grasshopper (&quot;Stethophyma grossum&quot;) and the mole cricket (&quot;Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa&quot;), all rare in Britain. In 2009, 500 adult southern damselflies were captured and released in the Venn Ottery nature reserve in Devon, which is owned and managed by the Devon Wildlife Trust. The Forest is an important stronghold for a rich variety of fungi, and although these have been heavily gathered in the past, there are control measures now in place to manage this.

===Birds===
Specialist heathland birds are widespread, including Dartford warbler (&quot;Curruca undata&quot;), woodlark (&quot;Lullula arborea&quot;), northern lapwing (&quot;Vanellus vanellus&quot;), Eurasian curlew (&quot;Numenius arquata&quot;), European nightjar (&quot;Caprimulgus europaeus&quot;), Eurasian hobby (&quot;Falco subbuteo&quot;), European stonechat (&quot;Saxicola rubecola&quot;), common redstart (&quot;Phoenicurus phoenicurus&quot;) and tree pipit (&quot;Anthus sylvestris&quot;). As in much of Britain common snipe (&quot;Gallinago gallinago&quot;) and meadow pipit (&quot;Anthus trivialis&quot;) are common as wintering birds, but in the Forest they still also breed in many of the bogs and heaths respectively.

Woodland birds include wood warbler (&quot;Phylloscopus sibilatrix&quot;), stock dove (&quot;Columba oenas&quot;), European honey buzzard (&quot;Pernis apivorus&quot;) and northern goshawk (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;). Common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;) is very common and common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) is spreading. Birds seen more rarely include red kite (&quot;Milvus milvus&quot;), wintering great grey shrike (&quot;Lanius exubitor&quot;) and hen harrier (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;) and migrating ring ouzel (&quot;Turdus torquatus&quot;) and northern wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot;).

===Reptiles and amphibians===

All three British native species of snake inhabit the Forest. The adder (&quot;Vipera berus&quot;) is the most common, being found on open heath and grassland. The grass snake (&quot;Natrix natrix&quot;) prefers the damper environment of the valley mires. The rare smooth snake (&quot;Coronella austriaca&quot;) occurs on sandy hillsides with heather and gorse. It was mainly adders which were caught by Brusher Mills (1840–1905), the &quot;New Forest Snake Catcher&quot;. He caught many thousands in his lifetime, sending some to London Zoo as food for their animals. A pub in Brockenhurst is named &quot;The Snakecatcher&quot; in his memory. All British snakes are now legally protected, and so the New Forest snakes are no longer caught.

A programme to reintroduce the sand lizard (&quot;Lacerta agilis&quot;) started in 1989 and the great crested newt (&quot;Triturus cristatus&quot;) already breeds in many locations.

Sand lizards in a captive breeding and reintroduction programme together with adders, grass snakes, smooth snakes, frogs and toads can be seen at The New Forest Reptile Centre about two miles east of Lyndhurst. The centre was established in 1969 by Derek Thomson MBE, a Forestry England keeper, who was also involved in establishing the deer viewing platform at nearby Bolderwood.

===Ponies, cattle, donkeys, pigs===
 Commoners&#x27; cattle, ponies and donkeys roam throughout the open heath and much of the woodland, and it is largely their grazing that maintains the open character of the Forest. They are also frequently seen in the Forest villages, where home and shop owners must take care to keep them out of gardens and shops. The New Forest pony is one of the indigenous horse breeds of the British Isles, and is one of the New Forest&#x27;s most famous attractions – most of the Forest ponies are of this breed, but there are also some Shetlands and their crossbreeds.

Cattle are of various breeds, most commonly Galloways and their crossbreeds, but also various other hardy types such as Highlands, Herefords, Dexters, Kerries and British whites. The pigs used for pannage, during the autumn months, are now of various breeds, but the New Forest was the original home of the Wessex Saddleback, now extinct in Britain.

===Deer===
Numerous deer live in the Forest; they are usually rather shy and tend to stay out of sight when people are around, but are surprisingly bold at night, even when a car drives past. Fallow deer (&quot;Dama dama&quot;) are the most common, followed by roe deer (&quot;Capreolus capreolus&quot;) and red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;). There are also smaller populations of the introduced sika deer (&quot;Cervus nippon&quot;) and muntjac (&quot;Muntiacus reevesii&quot;).

===Other mammals===
The red squirrel (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;) survived in the Forest until the 1970s – longer than most places in lowland Britain (though it still occurs on the Isle of Wight and the nearby Brownsea Island). It is now fully supplanted in the Forest by the introduced North American grey squirrel (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;). The European polecat (&quot;Mustela putorius&quot;) has recolonised the western edge of the Forest in recent years. European otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;) occurs along watercourses, as well as the introduced American mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;). In 2021 a population of Pine Martens was confirmed to be present.

===Conservation measures===
The New Forest is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), an EU Special Area of Conservation (SAC), a Special Protection Area for birds (SPA), and a Ramsar Site; it also has its own Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP).

== Settlements ==
The New Forest itself gives its name to the New Forest district of Hampshire, and the National Park area, of which it forms the core.

The Forest itself is dominated by four larger &#x27;defined&#x27; villages, Sway, Brockenhurst, Lyndhurst and Ashurst, with several smaller villages such as Burley, Beaulieu, Godshill, Fritham, Nomansland, and Minstead also lying within or immediately adjacent. Outside of the National Park Area in New Forest District, several clusters of larger towns frame the area – Totton and the Waterside settlements (Marchwood, Dibden, Hythe, Fawley) to the East, Christchurch, New Milton, Milford on Sea, and Lymington to the South, and Fordingbridge and Ringwood to the West.


==New Forest National Park==

Consultations on the possible designation of a National Park in the New Forest were commenced by the Countryside Agency in 1999. An order to create the park was made by the Agency on 24 January 2002 and submitted to the Secretary of State for confirmation in February 2002. Following objections from seven local authorities and others, a public inquiry was held from 8 October 2002 to 10 April 2003, and concluded by endorsing the proposal with some detailed changes to the boundary of the area to be designated.

On 28 June 2004, Rural Affairs Minister Alun Michael confirmed the government&#x27;s intention to designate the area as a National Park, with further detailed boundary adjustments. The area was formally designated as such on 1 March 2005. A national park authority for the New Forest was established on 1 April 2005 and assumed its full statutory powers on 1 April 2006.

Forestry England retain their powers to manage the Crown land within the Park. The Verderers under the New Forest Acts also retain their responsibilities, and the park authority is expected to co-operate with these bodies, the local authorities, English Nature and other interested parties.
The designated area of the National Park covers and includes many existing SSSIs. It has a population of about 38,000 (it excludes most of the 170,256 people who live in the New Forest local government district). As well as most of the New Forest district of Hampshire, it takes in the South Hampshire Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, a small corner of Test Valley district around the village of Canada and part of Wiltshire south-east of Redlynch.

The area covered by the park excludes two of the areas initially proposed: most of the valley of the River Avon to the west of the Forest and Dibden Bay to the east. Two challenges were made to the designation order, by Meyrick Estate Management Ltd in relation to the inclusion of Hinton Admiral Park, and by RWE NPower Plc in relation to the inclusion of Fawley Power Station. The second challenge was settled out of court, with the power station being excluded. The High Court upheld the first challenge; but an appeal against the decision was then heard by the Court of Appeal in Autumn 2006. The final ruling, published on 15 February 2007, found in favour of the challenge by Meyrick Estate Management Ltd, and the land at Hinton Admiral Park is therefore excluded from the New Forest National Park. The total area of land initially proposed for inclusion but ultimately left out of the Park is around .

== Cultural references ==
There is an allusion to the foundation of the New Forest in an end-rhyming poem found in the Peterborough Chronicle&#x27;s entry for 1087, &quot;The Rime of King William&quot;.

The Forest forms a backdrop to numerous books. &quot;The Children of the New Forest&quot; is a children&#x27;s novel published in 1847 by Frederick Marryat, set in the time of the English Civil War. Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;A New Forest Ballad&quot; (1847) mentions several New Forest locations, including Ocknell Plain, Bradley [Bratley] Water, Burley Walk and Lyndhurst churchyard. Edward Rutherfurd&#x27;s work of historical fiction, &quot;The Forest&quot; is based in the New Forest in the period from 1099 to 2000. The Forest is also a setting of the &quot;Warriors&quot; novel series, in which the &#x27;Forest Territories&#x27; was initially based on New Forest.

The New Forest and southeast England, around the 12th century, is a prominent setting in Ken Follett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;. It is also a prominent setting in Elizabeth George&#x27;s novel &quot;This Body of Death&quot;. Oberon, Titania and the other Shakespearean fairies live in a rapidly diminishing Sherwood Forest whittled away by urban development in the fantasy novel A Midsummer&#x27;s Nightmare by Garry Kilworth. On Midsummer&#x27;s Eve, a most auspicious day, the fairies embark on the long journey to the New Forest in Hampshire where the fairies&#x27; magic will be restored to its former glory.

<text>The South Downs National Park is England&#x27;s newest national park, designated on 31 March 2010. The park, covering an area of in southern England, stretches for from Winchester in the west to Eastbourne in the east, through the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex. The national park covers the chalk hills of the South Downs (which on the English Channel coast form the white cliffs of the Seven Sisters and Beachy Head) and a substantial part of a separate physiographic region, the western Weald, with its heavily wooded sandstone and clay hills and vales. The South Downs Way spans the entire length of the park and is the only National Trail that lies wholly within a national park.

==History==
The idea of a South Downs National Park originated in the 1920s, when public concern was mounting about increasing threats to the beauty of the downland environment, particularly the impact of indiscriminate speculative housing development on the eastern Sussex Downs (Peacehaven was an example of this). In 1929, the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, led by campaigners including the geographer Vaughan Cornish, submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister urging the case for national parks, including a national park on part of the South Downs. When however, towards the end of World War II, John Dower was asked to report on how a system of national parks in England and Wales might be established, his 1945 report, &quot;National Parks in England and Wales&quot;, did not identify the South Downs for national park status, but rather included it in a list of &quot;other amenity areas&quot;. Sir Arthur Hobhouse&#x27;s 1947 &quot;Report of the National Parks Committee&quot; took a different view, and he included the South Downs in his list of twelve areas recommended for designation as a national park, defined by John Dower as an &quot;extensive area of beautiful and relatively wild country in which, for the nation&#x27;s benefit...the characteristic landscape beauty is strictly preserved&quot;.

The South Downs was the last of the original twelve recommended national parks to be designated. Extensive damage to the chalk downland from 1940 onwards through arable farming, and a resulting decline in sheep grazing, militated at an early stage against further work on designation. When in 1956 the National Parks Commission came to consider the case for the South Downs as a national park, it found designation no longer appropriate, noting that the value of the South Downs as a potential national park had been reduced by cultivation. It did however recognise the &quot;great natural beauty&quot; of the area, and proposed it be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In due course two AONBs were designated, split along the county boundary, namely the East Hampshire AONB in 1962 and the Sussex Downs AONB in 1966. These were later to form the basis of the South Downs National Park.

In September 1999, the government, following a review of national parks policy, declared support for a South Downs National Park and announced a consultation on its creation. In January 2003 the then Countryside Agency (now Natural England) made an Order to designate the proposed park in 2003 which was submitted to the Secretary of State for the Environment on 27 January 2003.

As a result of objections and representations received on the proposed Order, a public inquiry was conducted between 10 November 2003 and 23 March 2005, with the aim of recommending to ministers whether a national park should be confirmed and, if so, where its boundaries should be. The results of the inquiry were expected by the end of 2005, but were delayed pending a legal issue arising from a High Court case challenging part of the Order designating the New Forest National Park.

Following an appeal on the High Court case and new legislation included in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, the South Downs Inquiry report was published on 31 March 2006. It recommended a 23% reduction in the size of the originally proposed national park, focussing it more narrowly on the chalk downland and excluding from it a large part of the existing East Hampshire and Sussex Downs AONBs. This proved controversial, leading to calls from the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England and others for the inclusion of the so-called western Weald, a region within the two AONBs possessing a geology, ecology and landscape quite different from the chalk hills of the South Downs, within the park boundary to ensure that it remained protected from development. The Secretary of State invited objections and representations on new issues relating to the proposed national park in a consultation that ran from 2 July to 13 August 2007. In the light of the responses received, the Secretary of State decided that it was appropriate to re-open the 2003–05 public inquiry. The inquiry re-opened on 12 February 2008 and was closed on 4 July 2008 after 27 sitting days. The Inspector&#x27;s report was submitted on 28 November 2008.

On 31 March 2009, the result of the inquiry was published. The Secretary of State, Hilary Benn, announced that the South Downs would be designated a national park, and on 12 November 2009 he signed the order confirming the designation. He confirmed that a number of disputed areas – including the western Weald, the town of Lewes and the village of Ditchling – would be included within the national park.

The new national park came into full operation on 1 April 2011 when the new South Downs National Park Authority assumed statutory responsibility for it. The occasion was marked by an opening ceremony which took place in the market square of Petersfield, a town in the western Weald just north of the chalk escarpment of the South Downs.

In 2016 the national park was granted International Dark Sky Reserve status, to restrict artificial light pollution above the park. It was the second such area in England and the 11th in the world.

==Administration==
The national park is administered by the South Downs National Park Authority (SDNPA). The body was established on 1 April 2010, and became fully functioning, including becoming the planning authority for the national park, on 1 April 2011. It is responsible for promoting the statutory purposes of the national park and the interests of the people who live and work within it. The statutory purposes of the SDNPA, as a national park authority, are specified by the Environment Act 1995; these are:

*To conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area
*To promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the Park&#x27;s special qualities by the public.

It must also fulfil the following duty:

*In carrying out its role, the authority has a duty to seek to foster the economic and social well-being of the communities living within the national park.

The SDNPA is a public body, funded by central government, and run by a board of 27 members. The board consists of seven national members, appointed by the environment secretary by means of an open recruitment process; fourteen local authority nominees drawn from the fifteen local authorities covering the park area (with Adur and Worthing opting to share a place); and six parish council representatives, two for each county.

As at June 2024, the chair of SDNPA is Vanessa Rowlands, and the chief executive (interim) is Tim Slaney.

==Geography==
The South Downs National Park stretches for across southern England from St Catherine&#x27;s Hill near Winchester in Hampshire in the west to Beachy Head, near Eastbourne in East Sussex in the east. In its western half, the southern boundary of the park lies up to inland from the south coast; it thus excludes the major coastal towns and cities of Southampton, Portsmouth, Chichester, Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Further east, where the park&#x27;s southern boundary lies much closer to the coast, it has been carefully drawn to exclude the urban areas of Worthing, Brighton and Hove, Newhaven, Seaford and Eastbourne, which had all made substantial encroachments onto the Downs during the 19th and 20th centuries. By contrast, the park includes a number of settlements in the western Weald, including Petersfield, Liss, Midhurst and Petworth, and the two historic Sussex towns of Arundel and Lewes.
The population living within the national park is approximately 108,000. Of these 42,000 live in Hampshire, 40,000 in West Sussex and 25,000 in East Sussex. East Hampshire District Council area and Chichester District each have around 30,000 residents in the area, and Lewes District 22,000. Winchester has 11,500 residents in the park, with much smaller numbers for the other districts and boroughs. In 2024, the park authority stated that it received around 18million visitors each year.

The national park has an area of , of which is in Hampshire, in West Sussex and in East Sussex. Among the district council areas, Chichester District has the largest area at , followed by East Hampshire District with , Winchester with , Lewes District with and Arun . are in Horsham District and in Wealden District.

Apart from a number of boundary revisions, the park incorporates two areas previously designated as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the East Hampshire AONB and Sussex Downs AONB. The park also includes the Queen Elizabeth Country Park near Petersfield.

The South Downs National Park&#x27;s chalk downland sets it apart from other national parks in Britain. However, almost a quarter (23%) of the national park consists of a quite different and strongly contrasting physiographic region, the western Weald, whose densely wooded hills and vales are based on an older Wealden geology of resistant sandstones and softer clays. The highest point in the national park, Blackdown, at above sea level, is within the Weald, on the Greensand Ridge, whereas the highest point on the chalk escarpment of the South Downs, Butser Hill, has an elevation of above sea level.

Within the national park there are two chalk hill figures, the Litlington White Horse and the Long Man of Wilmington.
==Geology==

Most of the national park consists of chalk downland, although a significant part consists of the sandstones and clays of the western Weald, a strongly contrasting and distinctive landscape of densely wooded hills and vales.

The chalk was formed in the Late Cretaceous epoch, between 100 million and 66 million years ago, when the area was under the sea. During the Cenozoic era the chalk was uplifted as part of the Weald uplift which created the great Weald–Artois Anticline, caused by the same orogenic movements that created the Alps. The relatively resistant chalk rock has, through weathering, resulted in a classic cuesta landform, with a northward-facing chalk escarpment that rises dramatically above the low-lying vales of the Low Weald.

The chalk escarpment reaches the English Channel west of Eastbourne, where it forms the dramatic white cliffs of Beachy Head, the Seven Sisters and Seaford Head. These cliffs were formed after the end of the last ice age, when sea levels rose and the English Channel was formed, resulting in under-cutting of the chalk by the sea.

The South Downs run linearly west-north-westwards from the Eastbourne area through southern Sussex to the Hampshire downs, separating the south coastal plain from the clays and sandstones of the Weald. Behind the escarpment, on the dip slope, are the characteristic high, smooth, rolling downland hills interrupted by dry valleys and wind gaps, and the major river gaps of the Cuckmere, Ouse, Adur and Arun.

The chalk is a white sedimentary rock, notably homogeneous and fine-grained, and very permeable. It consists of minute calcite plates (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. The strata include numerous layers of flint nodules, which have been widely exploited as a material for manufacture of stone tools as well as a building material for dwellings. Similar areas in Britain include the North Downs and the Chilterns.

In its western section, the national park extends north beyond the chalk escarpment of the South Downs into a quite different and strongly contrasting physiographic region, the western Weald, taking in the valley of the western River Rother, incised into Lower Greensand bedrock, and the densely wooded hills and valleys of the Greensand Ridge and Weald Clay south of Haslemere.

<text>In Spanish politics during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, El Turno Pacífico () was an informal system operated by the two major parties for determining in advance the result of a general election. The system ensured that the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party would have alternating periods in power.

==Operation==

Under the &quot;turno&quot;, the incoming government would first be chosen by the king and would then &quot;make&quot; the election (the so-called &quot;encasillado&quot; or &quot;pigeonholing&quot;), ensuring victory. After a period in office, it would then be the turn of the opposition. The key to the system was the link between the minister of the interior, the provincial civil governors, and the local bosses (&quot;caciques&quot;). These &quot;caciques&quot; in most constituencies would instruct their clients how to vote. A similar system in Portugal was called .

==Motivation==
The &quot;Turno Pacífico&quot; was put in place by Antonio Cánovas del Castillo and saw to it that the two &quot;official&quot; parties of the Cánovas Restoration, the Partido Conservador (or Liberal-Conservatives) and Partido Liberal (or the Liberals), retained power in alternation. Both parties upheld the monarchy and could be seen as factions of the &quot;governing class&quot;. 

After almost a century of political instability and many civil wars, the Restoration of 1874 sought to achieve political stability in Spain. Under the &quot;turno&quot;, no sector of the bourgeoisie felt isolated and patronage could be doubled. It worked effectively until 1898, surviving the death of Alfonso XII in 1885, but then became more difficult to operate because of divisions within the major parties and the growing mobilization of sectors of the electorate.

==Cessation==
Despite being modelled on the United Kingdom, Spanish democracy lacked a responsiveness to popular opinion as (until about 1914) the outcome of elections was broadly decided in advance. Growing opposition was first apparent after Spain&#x27;s defeat in the Spanish–American War. A period of grave instability occurred in 1918 and 1919, but between 1920 and 1923, a serious attempt was made to reconstruct the &quot;turno&quot;. It was brought to an end by the military coup by General Miguel Primo de Rivera in September 1923.

<text>The ENSTA Paris, officially École nationale supérieure de techniques avancées (; ), is a French graduate school of engineering (&quot;école d&#x27;ingénieurs&quot;). Founded in 1741, it is the oldest &quot;grande école&quot; in France. It is located in Palaiseau in the south of Paris, on the Paris-Saclay campus, and is a constituent faculty of the Polytechnic Institute of Paris. In 2021, 180 engineers graduated from the school.

== History ==
Originally, the school was the brainchild of Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, inspector general of the Navy. He had identified the need to give the Navy&#x27;s master carpenters a theoretical education, particularly in mathematics and physics, which were making quick progress, so that they would have a clearer understanding of their trade.

Duhamel du Monceau founded the first school in his home in Paris on the Isle Saint Louis in 1741. This date is recognised as the origin of the institution. In 1748 it was moved to the royal library on rue Richelieu, and in 1753 to the Louvre Palace, immediately adjacent to the Académie des Sciences. It was closed in 1759 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1765, he managed to persuade the duc de Choiseul to reopen it as part of a sweeping overhaul of the navy. Duhamel du Monceau continued to run the school for the rest of his life.

The School of Student Engineer Constructors, as it was known, was closed in 1793 during the French Revolution. It reopened in 1795 as an application school for the Ecole Polytechnique. Later on, it became known as Ecole nationale supérieure du Génie maritime (National Higher College of Maritime Engineering).

In 1970, the Délégation générale pour l&#x27;Armement (Arms administration of the Ministry of Defence) merged the school with three of its other establishments:

- the École nationale supérieure des Poudres (Powders and explosives institute)

- the École nationale supérieure de l&#x27;Armement (Arms engineering institute)

- the École des Ingénieurs hydrographes de la Marine (Hydrographic institute).

This formed the École nationale supérieure de Techniques avancées (ENSTA), the role of which is to train engineers in the naval, mechanical, nuclear, chemical, electronic and related fields. The scientific skills of each of the founding institutes survives in the broad range of research disciplines covered at ENSTA, as well as in the more general nature of its teaching and the variety of specialities offered to the students.

Today, ENSTA&#x27;s legal status is that of a &quot;public administrative establishment&quot;, placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Defence. It is headed by a general officer of the Corps of Ordnance Ingineers (). Some former graduates of attend ENSTA before joining the military Corps of Ordnance Engineers, which staffs the .

==Academics==
&quot;ENSTA Paris&quot; is a &quot;Grande École&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; typically they have much smaller class sizes and student bodies than public universities in France, and many of their programs are taught in English. While most &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are more expensive than French universities, &quot;ENSTA Paris&quot; charges the same tuition fees: €243 annually for the master&#x27;s degree in 2021/2022 International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;. Degrees from &quot;ENSTA Paris&quot; are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) (). Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

<doc id="579858" wikidata="Q7851778" url="?curid=579858" title="Tuition fees in the United Kingdom">
<text>Tuition fees were first introduced across the entire United Kingdom in September 1998 under the Labour government of Tony Blair to help fund tuition for undergraduate and postgraduate certificate students at universities; students were required to pay up to £1,000 a year for tuition. However, only those who reach a certain salary threshold (£21,000) pay this fee through general taxation. In practice, higher education (HE) remains free at the point of entry in England for a high minority of students.

The state pays for the poorest or low income to access a university, thus university attendance remains high. There are record levels of disadvantaged students accessing a university in England. As a result of the devolved national administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, there are now different arrangements for tuition fees in each of the nations. The Minister of State for Universities has oversight over British universities and the Student Loans Company.

==History==

From 1945 onwards, fees were generally covered by local authorities and were not paid by students. This was formalised by the Education Act 1962 which established a mandate for local authorities to cover the fees. In practice, this meant that fees were not charged from then until the repeal of the act in 1998. During the period university tuition was effectively available for free.

===Dearing report and £1,000 fee cap (1998)===

In May 1996, Gillian Shephard, Secretary of State for Education and Employment, commissioned an inquiry, led by the then Chancellor of the University of Nottingham, Sir Ron Dearing, into the funding of British higher education over the next 20 years. This National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education reported to the new Labour Government, in the summer of 1997, stating additional billions of funding would be needed over the period, including £350 million in 1998–99 and £565 million in 1999–2000, in order to expand student enrolment, provide more support for part-time students and ensure adequate infrastructure. The committee, as part of its brief, had controversially investigated the possibility of students contributing to the cost of this expansion, either through loans, a graduate tax, deferred contributions or means-testing state assistance, as their report notes:
 We do not underestimate the strength of feeling on the issue of seeking a contribution towards tuition costs: nor do we dispute the logic of the arguments put forward. A detailed assessment of the issues has, however, convinced us that the arguments in favour of a contribution to tuition costs from graduates in work are strong, if not widely appreciated. They relate to equity between social groups, broadening participation, equity with part-time students in higher education and in further education, strengthening the student role in higher education, and identifying a new source of income that can be ring-fenced for higher education.

 We have, therefore, analysed the implications of a range of options against the criteria set out in paragraph 20.2. There is a wide array of options from which to choose, ranging from asking graduates to contribute only to their living costs to asking all graduates to contribute to their tuition costs. We have chosen to examine four options in depth.
In response to the findings, the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 was published on 26 November 1997, and enacted on 16 July 1998, part of which introduced tuition fees in all the countries of the United Kingdom.

The act introduced a means-tested method of payment for students based on the amount of money their families earned. Starting with 1999–2000, maintenance grants for living expenses would also be replaced with loans and paid back at a rate of 9% of a graduate&#x27;s income above £10,000.

Following devolution in 1999, the newly devolved governments in Scotland and Wales brought in their own acts on tuition fees. The Scottish Parliament established, and later abolished a graduate endowment to replace the fees. Wales introduced maintenance grants of up to £1,500 in 2002, a value which has since risen to over £5000.

===Higher Education act and £3,000 fee cap (2004)===
In England, tuition fee caps rose with the Higher Education Act of 2004. Under the Act, universities in England could begin to charge variable fees of up to £3,000 a year for students enrolling on courses from the academic year of 2006–07 or later. The passing of the aforementioned act caused political controversy due to the influence of Scottish Labour MPs on the vote, which passed with a majority of just five. This policy was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006–07 and introduced in Wales in 2007–08. In 2009–10 the cap rose to £3,225 a year to take account of inflation.

===Browne review and £9,000 fee cap (2012)===

Tuition fees were a major concern at the 2010 general election. The Liberal Democrat party entered the election on a pledge to abolish tuition fees, but had already made preparations to abandon the policy before the election took place. The party entered into coalition government with the Conservatives, who supported an increase in fees. Following the Browne Review the cap was controversially raised to £9,000 a year, approximately treble the previous cap; this sparked large student protests in London. The intention from the government of the time was that most universities would charge about £6,000, and that the £9,000 rate would only be charge in &quot;exceptional&quot; circumstances. In practice most universities immediately began to charge the maximum £9,000 fee. A judicial review against the raised fees failed in 2012, and so the new fee system came into use that September.

The Liberal Democrats conceded that their U-turn on the issue contributed to their defeat at the 2015 election, during which 48 of their 56 seats were lost; the election returned a Conservative majority. Further adjustments were put forth in the 2015 budget, with a proposed fee increase in line with inflation from the 2017–18 academic year onwards, and the planned scrapping of maintenance grants from September 2016. The changes were debated by the Third Delegated Legislation Committee in January 2016, rather than in the Commons. The lack of a vote on the matter drew criticism, as by circumventing the Commons the measures &quot;automatically&quot; became law. Tuition fees and perceptions about them are directly linked to satisfaction.

===May reform, and frozen fees (2018)===
Students voted in large numbers against the government in the 2017 general election and caused the Conservative Party to lose their majority. In February 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May launched a review of post-18 education funding, including university funding and possible alternatives to tuition fees and loans. The review, which was designed to appeal to students, resulted in the expansion of vocational studies in England, and the new T-levels. In February 2020, Labour Party leadership candidate Keir Starmer (who went on to win the 2020 Labour leadership election), promised to maintain the Labour Party&#x27;s commitment to abolishing tuition fees, but later indicated that Labour would not pursue free tertiary education should they win the next election. This U-turn on policy was criticised by the Green Party of England and Wales, who in contrast support scrapping university tuition fees in the UK, as well as abolishing outstanding debts for undergraduate tuition fees and maintenance loans, alongside any related interest fees. 

The fees remained frozen at £9,250 until 2025. This ultimately caused a crisis in university funding as high inflation eroded the value of tuition fees. The £9,250 fees charged in 2023 were worth only £6,500 in 2012 terms. This was the cause of mass-layoffs in the sector beginning in late 2023, affecting 50 institutions. By 2024 universities were generally taking on domestic students at a loss, with the actual cost of tuition around £11,000; or £12,500 in Russell Group universities. Universities have made up the difference by charging higher fees to international students, as their fees are unlimited, but international applications began to decline that year after the government tightened visa rules. Approximately 40% of UK universities are currently running budget deficits, and the Office for Students has forecast that this may lead to mergers and closures of universities without intervention.

In November 2024, it was announced that fees would rise to £9,535 from September 2025, a £285 rise. The National Union of Students described the rise as a &quot;sticking plaster&quot;, with the government stating they would announce &#x27;major reform&#x27; at a later date.

==Current systems==
===England===
In England, undergraduate tuition fees are capped at £9,250 a year for UK and Irish students. Due to Brexit, starting in autumn 2021, EU, other EEA and Swiss nationals are no longer eligible for the home fee status, meaning higher fees and no access to UK government loans unless they have been granted a settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme. Around 76% of all institutions charged the full amount of tuition fees in 2015–16. A loan of the same size is available for most universities, although students at private institutions are only eligible for £6,000 a year loans.

Since 2017–18, the fee cap is meant to be raised in line with inflation. In October 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that tuition fees would be temporarily frozen at £9,250. , this temporary freeze remained in place and was expected to be extended as a university funding review is carried out. The latter, which was launched by Theresa May, was chaired by Philip Augar.

In the 2015 spending review, the government also proposed a freeze in the repayment threshold for tuition fee loans at £21,000.

====Effect====
Many commentators suggested that the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, the gap between rich and poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.

A 2018 study by Murphy, Scott-Clayton, and Wyness found that the introduction of tuition fees had &quot;increased funding per head, rising enrolments, and a narrowing of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students&quot;.

===Northern Ireland===
Tuition fees are currently capped at £4,030 in Northern Ireland, with loans of the same size available from Student Finance NI. Loan repayments are made when income rises above £17,335 a year, with graduates paying back a percentage of their earnings above this threshold.

===Scotland===

Tuition fees are handled by the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS), which does not charge fees from what it defines as &quot;Young Students&quot;, or &quot;Dependent Students&quot;. Young Students are defined as those under 25, without dependent children, marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting partner, who have not been outside of full-time education for more than three years. Fees exist for those outside the young student definition. The tuition fees are usually £1,820 for undergraduate courses for Scottish &amp; Irish students, and £9,250 for students from the rest of the UK. Due to Brexit, from Autumn 2021 EU students will have to pay international tuition fees in Scotland ranging from £10,000 to £26,000 per year depending on the university and degree type unless they have been granted a settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme. At the postgraduate level, Scots and RUK usually pay the same amount, commonly between £5,000 and £15,000 per year, while tuition fees for international students can run as high as £30,000 per year.

Fee discrimination against students from the rest of the UK has been challenged in the past but deemed legal. The Scottish government confirmed in April 2019 that, with regards to tuition fees, EU students would be treated the same as Scottish students for their whole course if they begin studies up until 2020.

The system has been in place since 2007 when graduate endowments were abolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/02/28172530&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Labour&#x27;s education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty. Scotland has fewer disadvantaged students than England, Wales or Northern Ireland and disadvantaged students receive around £560 a year less in financial support than their counterparts in England do.

===Wales===
In Wales tuition fees are capped at £9,250 for all UK students as of September 2024, having increased by £250 from the previous £9,000. Welsh students may apply for a non-means tested tuition fee loan to cover 100 per cent of tuition fee costs wherever they choose to study in the UK.

Welsh students used to be able to apply for fee grants of up to £5,190, in addition to a £3,810 loan to cover tuition fee costs. However, the Welsh Government changed this system after the Diamond Review was published. Today students have access to a means tested loan system where students from the poorest households can be eligible for a grant of up to £10,124 if studying in London or up to £8,100 if studying in the rest of the UK. The changes became effective for students starting University in September 2018. The Welsh Government argued this would allow for higher maintenance loans and grants and these costs are the biggest barrier for poorer students to attend University.

==Interest fees==
Students and graduates pay interest fees on student loans. Interest starts being added to the student loan from when the first payment is made. In 2012 this rate was set at the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus up to 3% depending on income. Students who started university between 1998 and 2011 pay Bank of England base rate plus 1% or RPI, whichever is lower. Students who started university before 1998 pay interest set at the RPI rate. As a consequence of the 2012 change, students who graduated in 2017 pay between 3.1% and 6.1% interest, despite the Bank of England base rate being 0.25%. In 2018, interest fees rose again, this time to 6.3% for anyone who started studying after 2012.

If those who have taken out a student loan do not update their details with the Student Loans Company when receiving a letter or an email to update their employment status, or upon leaving the UK for 3 or more months, start a new job or become self-employed, or stop working, then they can possibly face a higher interest rate on their loan.

In June 2019, the Brexit Party stated it would scrap all interest paid on student tuition fees and has suggested reimbursing graduates for historic interest payments made on their loans. In August 2019, government figures uncovered by the Labour Party showed that &quot;students will owe a staggering £8.6bn in interest alone on their loans within five years ... almost double the current debt&quot;.

==Possible alternatives==
There have been two main proposed alternative ways of funding university studies: from general taxation or by a graduate tax.

===Funding from general taxation===
Tuition is paid for by general taxation in Germany, although only around 30% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%. Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrats as a &#x27;tax cut for the rich and a tax rise for the poor&#x27; because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.

Jeremy Corbyn, former Labour leader, stated that he would have removed tuition fees and would have instead funded higher education by increasing national insurance and corporation tax. In the long term this plan would have been expected to cost the government about £8 billion a year.

In July 2017, Lord Adonis, former Number 10 Policy Unit staffer and education minister largely responsible for introducing tuition fees, said that the system had become a &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s monster&quot; putting many students over £50,000 in debt. He argued the system should either be scrapped or fees reverted to between £1,000 and £3,000 per the initial scheme.

===Graduate tax===
During the 2015 Labour leadership election, Andy Burnham said that he would introduce a graduate tax to replace fees. He was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for leadership. A graduate tax has been criticised because there would be no way to recover the money from students who move to a different country, or foreign students who return home.

<doc id="579863" wikidata="Q154602" url="?curid=579863" title="Otto Nicolai">
<text>Carl Otto Ehrenfried Nicolai (9 June 1810 – 11 May 1849) was a German composer, conductor, and one of the founders of the Vienna Philharmonic. Nicolai is best known for his operatic version of Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; as &quot;&quot;. In addition to five operas, Nicolai composed lieder, works for orchestra, chorus, ensemble, and solo instruments.

==Biography==
Nicolai, a child prodigy, was born in Königsberg, Prussia. He received his first musical education from his father, Carl Ernst Daniel Nicolai, who was also a composer and musical director. During his childhood his parents divorced, and while still a youth, early in June 1826, Nicolai ran away from his parents&#x27; &quot;loveless&quot; home, taking refuge in Stargard with a senior legal official called August Adler who treated the musical prodigy like a son and, when Nicolai was seventeen, sent him to Berlin to study with Carl Friedrich Zelter.

After initial successes in Germany, including his first symphony (1831) and public concerts, he became musician to the Prussian embassy in Rome. When Verdi declined the libretto of &quot;Il proscritto&quot; by the proprietors of La Scala in Milan, it was offered instead to Nicolai. Later, Nicolai refused a libretto by the same author, and it went to Verdi, whose &quot;Nabucco&quot; was his first early success. All of Nicolai&#x27;s operas were originally written in Italian, the sole exception being his last and best known opera, &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, written in German. At one time he was even more popular in Italy than Verdi.

During the early 1840s, Nicolai established himself as a major figure in the concert life of Vienna. In 1844 he was offered the position, vacated by Felix Mendelssohn, of Kapellmeister at the Berlin Cathedral; but he did not reestablish himself in Berlin until the last year of his life.

On 11 May 1849, two months after the premiere of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, and only two days after his appointment as &quot;Hofkapellmeister&quot; at the Berlin Staatsoper, he collapsed and died from a stroke. On the same day of his death, he was elected a member of the Royal Prussian Academy of Arts.

Nicolai was portrayed by Hans Nielsen in the 1940 film &quot;Falstaff in Vienna&quot;.

<text>Dimensionality reduction, or dimension reduction, is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension. Working in high-dimensional spaces can be undesirable for many reasons; raw data are often sparse as a consequence of the curse of dimensionality, and analyzing the data is usually computationally intractable. Dimensionality reduction is common in fields that deal with large numbers of observations and/or large numbers of variables, such as signal processing, speech recognition, neuroinformatics, and bioinformatics.

Methods are commonly divided into linear and nonlinear approaches. Linear approaches can be further divided into feature selection and feature extraction. Dimensionality reduction can be used for noise reduction, data visualization, cluster analysis, or as an intermediate step to facilitate other analyses.

==Feature selection==

The process of feature selection aims to find a suitable subset of the input variables (&quot;features&quot;, or &quot;attributes&quot;) for the task at hand. The three strategies are: the &quot;filter&quot; strategy (e.g., information gain), the &quot;wrapper&quot; strategy (e.g., accuracy-guided search), and the &quot;embedded&quot; strategy (features are added or removed while building the model based on prediction errors).

Data analysis such as regression or classification can be done in the reduced space more accurately than in the original space.

==Feature projection==
Feature projection (also called feature extraction) transforms the data from the high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. The data transformation may be linear, as in principal component analysis (PCA), but many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques also exist. For multidimensional data, tensor representation can be used in dimensionality reduction through multilinear subspace learning.
===Principal component analysis (PCA)===
The main linear technique for dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis, performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower-dimensional space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized. In practice, the covariance (and sometimes the correlation) matrix of the data is constructed and the eigenvectors on this matrix are computed. The eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (the principal components) can now be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data. Moreover, the first few eigenvectors can often be interpreted in terms of the large-scale physical behavior of the system, because they often contribute the vast majority of the system&#x27;s energy, especially in low-dimensional systems. Still, this must be proved on a case-by-case basis as not all systems exhibit this behavior. The original space (with dimension of the number of points) has been reduced (with data loss, but hopefully retaining the most important variance) to the space spanned by a few eigenvectors. 

===Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)===
NMF decomposes a non-negative matrix to the product of two non-negative ones, which has been a promising tool in fields where only non-negative signals exist, such as astronomy. NMF is well known since the multiplicative update rule by Lee &amp; Seung, which has been continuously developed: the inclusion of uncertainties, the consideration of missing data and parallel computation, sequential construction which leads to the stability and linearity of NMF, as well as other updates including handling missing data in digital image processing.

With a stable component basis during construction, and a linear modeling process, sequential NMF is able to preserve the flux in direct imaging of circumstellar structures in astronomy, as one of the methods of detecting exoplanets, especially for the direct imaging of circumstellar discs. In comparison with PCA, NMF does not remove the mean of the matrices, which leads to physical non-negative fluxes; therefore NMF is able to preserve more information than PCA as demonstrated by Ren et al.

===Kernel PCA===

Principal component analysis can be employed in a nonlinear way by means of the kernel trick. The resulting technique is capable of constructing nonlinear mappings that maximize the variance in the data. The resulting technique is called kernel PCA.

===Graph-based kernel PCA===
Other prominent nonlinear techniques include manifold learning techniques such as Isomap, locally linear embedding (LLE), Hessian LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, and methods based on tangent space analysis. These techniques construct a low-dimensional data representation using a cost function that retains local properties of the data, and can be viewed as defining a graph-based kernel for Kernel PCA.

More recently, techniques have been proposed that, instead of defining a fixed kernel, try to learn the kernel using semidefinite programming. The most prominent example of such a technique is maximum variance unfolding (MVU). The central idea of MVU is to exactly preserve all pairwise distances between nearest neighbors (in the inner product space) while maximizing the distances between points that are not nearest neighbors.

An alternative approach to neighborhood preservation is through the minimization of a cost function that measures differences between distances in the input and output spaces. Important examples of such techniques include: classical multidimensional scaling, which is identical to PCA; Isomap, which uses geodesic distances in the data space; diffusion maps, which use diffusion distances in the data space; t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which minimizes the divergence between distributions over pairs of points; and curvilinear component analysis.

A different approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction is through the use of autoencoders, a special kind of feedforward neural networks with a bottleneck hidden layer. The training of deep encoders is typically performed using a greedy layer-wise pre-training (e.g., using a stack of restricted Boltzmann machines) that is followed by a finetuning stage based on backpropagation.
===Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)===

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a generalization of Fisher&#x27;s linear discriminant, a method used in statistics, pattern recognition, and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.

===Generalized discriminant analysis (GDA)===
GDA deals with nonlinear discriminant analysis using kernel function operator. The underlying theory is close to the support-vector machines (SVM) insofar as the GDA method provides a mapping of the input vectors into high-dimensional feature space. Similar to LDA, the objective of GDA is to find a projection for the features into a lower dimensional space by maximizing the ratio of between-class scatter to within-class scatter.

===Autoencoder===

Autoencoders can be used to learn nonlinear dimension reduction functions and codings together with an inverse function from the coding to the original representation.

===t-SNE===

T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique useful for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. It is not recommended for use in analysis such as clustering or outlier detection since it does not necessarily preserve densities or distances well.

===UMAP===

Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique. Visually, it is similar to t-SNE, but it assumes that the data is uniformly distributed on a locally connected Riemannian manifold and that the Riemannian metric is locally constant or approximately locally constant.

==Dimension reduction==
For high-dimensional datasets, dimension reduction is usually performed prior to applying a &quot;k&quot;-nearest neighbors (&quot;k&quot;-NN) algorithm in order to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.

Feature extraction and dimension reduction can be combined in one step, using principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) techniques to pre-process the data, followed by clustering via &quot;k&quot;-NN on feature vectors in a reduced-dimension space. In machine learning, this process is also called low-dimensional embedding.

For high-dimensional datasets (e.g., when performing similarity search on live video streams, DNA data, or high-dimensional time series), running a fast approximate &quot;k&quot;-NN search using locality-sensitive hashing, random projection, &quot;sketches&quot;, or other high-dimensional similarity search techniques from the VLDB conference toolbox may be the only feasible option.

==Applications==
A dimensionality reduction technique that is sometimes used in neuroscience is maximally informative dimensions, which finds a lower-dimensional representation of a dataset such that as much information as possible about the original data is preserved.

<doc id="579872" wikidata="Q144565" url="?curid=579872" title="Tughril I">
<text>Abu Talib Muhammad Tughril ibn Mika&#x27;il (), better known as Tughril (; also spelled Toghril / Tughrul), was a Turkoman chieftain, who founded the Seljuk Empire, ruling from 1037 to 1063.

Tughril united many Turkoman warriors of the Central Asian steppes into a confederacy of tribes and led them in conquest of Khorasan and eastern Persia. He would later establish the Seljuk Sultanate after conquering Persia and taking the Abbasid capital of Baghdad from the Buyids in 1055. Tughril relegated the Abbasid Caliphs to state figureheads and took command of the caliphate&#x27;s armies in military offensives against the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimids in an effort to expand his empire&#x27;s borders and unite the Islamic world.

Before the advent of the Seljuks, Persia was divided between several warring local powers, such as the Buyids, Kakuyids and Ghaznavids. As a result, it suffered from continuous war and destruction. However, under Tughril peace and prosperity were brought to the country and to Mesopotamia, a transition that was further reinforced due to the Seljuks&#x27; assimilation to Iranian-Muslim culture.

== Name ==

&quot;Tughril&quot; was the Old Turkic word for a bird of prey, possibly the Crested goshawk. In early Turkic history and culture, starting from the Uyghur Khaganate and onwards, it was used as a personal name.

==Early life==

Tughril was born in , most likely in the Central Asian steppes, where nomadic Oghuz Turks were roaming to find pasture for livestock. After the death of his father Mikail, Tughril and his brother Chaghri were reportedly raised by their grandfather Seljuk (the eponymous founder of the Seljuks) in Jand. It was seemingly during this period that the Seljuk family converted to Islam, at least nominally. In the following decades, the Seljuks were employed as mercenaries under the warring factions of Transoxiana and Khwarazm, in exchange for pasture for their herds.

In the 1020s, Tughril and his other relatives were serving the Kara-Khanids of Bukhara. In 1026, the Kara-Khanids were driven out of Bukhara by the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. Seljuk&#x27;s son Arslan Isra&#x27;il fled to a place near Sarakhs, where he asked Mahmud for permission to settle in the area in return for military aid. Mahmud, however, had Arslan Isra&#x27;il put in prison, where the latter soon died. Meanwhile, Tughril and Chaghri remained loyal to their Kara-Khanid overlords, although there were disputes between them in 1029; in 1032, they fought alongside the Kara-Khanids at the Battle of Dabusiyya.

After the Kara-Khanid ruler Ali-Tegin&#x27;s death, however, the Seljuks changed their allegiance to the ruler of Khwarazm, Harun, but were repelled by the Oghuz ruler Shah Malik in 1035. The Seljuks then went to the same place as Arslan Isra&#x27;il, and asked the son of Mahmud, Mas&#x27;ud I, for asylum. Mas&#x27;ud, however, considered the nomadic Turks to be dangerous and sent an army under his commander-in-chief Begtoghdi. The army was shortly defeated by the Seljuks, who forced Mas&#x27;ud to surrender Nasa, Farava and Dihistan in return for Seljuk recognition of Ghaznavid authority and protection of the region from other Turkic tribes.

In 1037, the Seljuks also forced the Ghaznavids to cede them Sarakhs, Abivard and Marw. The Seljuks then slowly began to subdue the cities of Khorasan, and, when they captured Nishapur, Tughril proclaimed himself Sultan of Khorasan.

== Reign ==

Mas&#x27;ud, after having returned to Khorasan, expelled the Seljuks from Herat and Nishapur. He soon marched towards Merv to completely remove the Seljuk threat from Khorasan. His army included 50,000 men and 12 to 60 war elephants.

The Battle of Dandanaqan shortly took place near Merv, where the army of Mas&#x27;ud was defeated by a smaller army under Tughril, his brother Chaghri Beg, and the Kakuyid prince Faramurz. Mas&#x27;ud thus permanently lost control of all of western Khorasan. This victory marked the foundation of the Seljuk Empire, which was now rapidly expanding west.

Tughril then installed Chagri as the governor of Khorasan and prevented a Ghaznavid reconquest, then moved on to the conquest of the Iranian plateau from 1040 to 1044; in 1041–1042, Tughril conquered Tabaristan and Gurgan, and appointed a certain Mardavij ibn Bishui as the governor of the region. In 1042/3, he conquered Ray and Qazvin, and at the same his suzerainty was acknowledged by the Justanid ruler of Daylam. The Sallarid ruler of Shamiran also shortly acknowledged his overlordship. In 1054, Tughril forced the Rawadid ruler of Azerbaijan, Abu Mansur Wahsudan, to acknowledge his authority. Tughril&#x27;s name was placed in the &quot;khutba&quot; (Friday prayer), while a son of Wahsudan, possibly Abu&#x27;l-Hayja Manuchihr, was sent as a Seljuk hostage to Khurasan. In the same year, Tughril&#x27;s forces were contending in Anatolia with the Byzantines.

In 1055 he was commissioned by the Abbasid Caliph Al-Qa&#x27;im to recapture Baghdad from the Buyids. A revolt by Turcoman forces under his foster brother İbrahim Yinal and the efforts of Buyid forces led to the loss of the city to the Fatimid Caliph in 1058. Two years later Tughril crushed the rebellion, personally strangling İbrahim with his bowstring and entered Baghdad. He then married the daughter of the Abbasid Caliph near the city of Tabriz.

==Death and succession==
Tughril died on 4 October 1063 in Ray, at the age of seventy. Having no children, he had nominated his infant nephew Sulayman (a son of Chaghri Beg) as his successor. The vizier al-Kunduri supported this choice and may have been the one to suggest it to greatly expand his authority as the regent of the child. The succession was contested by Chaghri Beg&#x27;s more competent and elder son Alp Arslan, who had ruled Khurasan since his father&#x27;s death in 1059. Alp Arslan quickly asserted his authority over the whole empire, becoming the first Seljuk ruler to rule over both Tughril&#x27;s and Chaghri&#x27;s lands.

==Family==
One of his wives was Altun Jan Khatun. She was a Turkic woman, probably from Khwarazm, and had been married to Khwarazm Shah Shah Malik, with whom she had a son named Anushirvan. They married in around 1043. She died on December 1060. Another wife was Akka Khatun. After Tughril&#x27;s death, she married Alp Arslan. Another of his wives was the daughter of Abu Kalijar. They married in 1047–48. Another wife was Farrukh al-Khatuni, widow of his brother Chaghri Beg, and mother of his son, Suleiman. They married after Chaghri&#x27;s death in 1060. Another wife was Sayida Khatun. She was the daughter of Abbasid Caliph Al-Qaim. In 1061, Tughril sent the &quot;qadi&quot; of Ray to Baghdad, to ask her hand in marriage to him. The marriage contract was concluded in August–September 1062 outside Tabriz, with a marriage proportion of one hundred thousand dinars. She was brought to the Sultan&#x27;s palace in March–April 1063. After Tughril&#x27;s death, Alp Arslan sent her back to Baghdad in 1064. In 1094, Caliph Al-Mustazhir compelled her to remain in her house lest she should intrigue for his overthrow. She died on 20 October 1102.

==Legacy==

Sultan Tughril was undoubtedly a military genius. Though his military campaigns inflicted serious damage on the productive forces of many conquered states, they paved the way for the establishment of the first powerful medieval empire of the Turks that linked &quot;the East and the West&quot;. The formation of a vast empire objectively led to important changes in socio-economic, political and cultural life. The role of the landowning aristocracy markedly increased. Gradually, a new apparatus of state administration and an imperial system of civil and military administration took shape.

Tughril&#x27;s conquests had an impact on the lives of not only the people of annexed states, but also the nomads themselves, who participated in the establishment of the new state. Noticeable changes in the life of the Oguz-Turkmen tribes occurred as they settled in Khorasan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Transcaucasia and Asia Minor. The transition of compact groups of nomads to a semi-settled and sedentary life and agriculture took place. The old tribal ties broke up; feudal relations received a new incentive for further development, although remnants of archaic institutions remained for a long time. The Seljuk nobility began to gradually merge with the feudal aristocracy of the conquered lands.

<doc id="579883" wikidata="Q248758" url="?curid=579883" title="Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit">
<text>Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS) is a modern linguistic category applied to the language used in a class of Indian Buddhist texts, such as the Perfection of Wisdom sutras. BHS is classified as a Middle Indo-Aryan language. It is sometimes called &quot;Buddhist Sanskrit&quot; or &quot;Mixed Sanskrit&quot;.

==Origin==
Prior to Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit teachings used to be generally recorded in the Pali language. Pali language was common at the time of the Buddha. His teachings were apparently first found in Pali language written by Theravada buddhists.

Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit became the pre-eminent language for literature and philosophy in India. Buddhist monks developed this language they used to it while remaining under the influence of a linguistic tradition stemming from the proto-canonical Prakrit of the early oral tradition. While there are widely differing theories regarding the relationship of Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit to Pali, but it is certain that Pāli is much closer to Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit than any other languages in india .

Norman K. is a scholar known for his work on Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit and Pali. His works mainly focus on understanding early Buddhist texts and their development comparing Pali, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit and Prakrit languages. According to K. R. Norman, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit could also be considered a form of pali. However, Franklin Edgerton states that Pāli is in essence a Prakrit.

==Relation to Sanskrit and Pāli==
In many places where BHS differs from Sanskrit it is closer to, or identical with, Pāli. Most extant BHS works were originally written in BHS, rather than being reworkings or translations of already existing works in Pāli or other languages. However, earlier works, mostly from the Mahāsāṃghika school, use a form of &quot;mixed Sanskrit&quot; in which the original Prakrit has been incompletely Sanskritised, with the phonetic forms being changed to the Sanskrit versions, but the grammar of Prakrit being retained. For instance, Prakrit &quot;bhikkhussa&quot;, the possessive singular of &quot;bhikkhu&quot; (monk, cognate with Sanskrit &quot;bhikṣu&quot;) is converted not to &quot;bhikṣoḥ&quot; as in Sanskrit but mechanically changed to &quot;bhikṣusya&quot;.

The term owes its usage and definition largely to the scholarship of Franklin Edgerton. Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit is primarily studied in the modern world in order to study the Buddhist teachings that it records, and to study the development of Indo-Aryan languages. Compared to Pāli and Classical Sanskrit, comparatively little study has been made of Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, in part because of the fewer available writings, and in part because of the view of some scholars that BHS is not distinct enough from Sanskrit to comprise a separate linguistic category. Edgerton writes that a reader of a Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit text &quot;will rarely encounter forms or expressions which are definitely ungrammatical, or at least more ungrammatical than, say, the Sanskrit of the epics, which also violates the strict rules of Pāṇini. Yet every paragraph will contain words and turns of expression which, while formally unobjectionable ... would never be used by any non-Buddhist writer.&quot;

Edgerton holds that nearly all Buddhist works in Sanskrit, at least until a late period, belong to a continuous and broadly unitary linguistic tradition. The language of these works is separate from the tradition of Brahmanical Sanskrit, and goes back ultimately to a semi-Sanskritized form of the protocanonical Prakrit. The peculiar Buddhist vocabulary of BHS is evidence that BHS is subordinate to a separate linguistic tradition quite separate from standard Sanskrit (Edgerton finds other indications as well). The Buddhist Brahmanical writers who used standard Brahmanical Sanskrit were small in number. This group seems to have been made up of converts who received Brahmanical training in their youth before converting to Buddhism, such as Asvaghosa.

Many Sanskrit words, or particular uses of Sanskrit words, are recorded only from Buddhist works. Pāli shares a large proportion of these words; in Edgerton&#x27;s view, this seems to prove that most of them belong to the special vocabulary of the protocanonical Buddhist Prakrit.

==Buddhist use of Classical Sanskrit==
Not all Buddhist use of Sanskrit is in a hybrid form. Some translated works, such as by the Sarvāstivādin school, were completed in classical Sanskrit. There were also later works composed directly in Sanskrit and written in a simpler style than the classical literature, as well as works of &quot;kavya&quot; in the ornate classical style such as the Buddhacarita.

==Parallels==

The terms &quot;Buddhist Hybrid Chinese&quot; and &quot;Buddhist Hybrid English&quot; have been used to describe peculiar styles of language used in translations of Buddhist texts.

<text>A rest is the absence of a sound for a defined period of time in music, or one of the musical notation signs used to indicate that.

The length of a rest corresponds with that of a particular note value, thus indicating how long the silence should last. Each type of rest is named for the note value it corresponds with (e.g. quarter note and quarter rest, or quaver and quaver rest), and each of them has a distinctive sign.

== Description ==
Rests are intervals of silence in pieces of music, marked by symbols indicating the length of the silence. Each rest symbol and name corresponds with a particular note value, indicating how long the silence should last, generally as a multiplier of a measure or whole note.


* The quarter (crotchet) rest (𝄽) may take a different form in older music.
* The four-measure rest or longa rest are only used in long silent passages which are not divided into bars.
* The combination of rests used to mark a silence follows the same rules as for note values.

=== One-bar rests ===

When an entire bar is devoid of notes, a whole (semibreve) rest is used, regardless of the actual time signature. Historically exceptions were made for a time signature (four half notes per bar), when a double whole (breve) rest was typically used for a bar&#x27;s rest, and for time signatures shorter than , when a rest of the actual measure length would be used. Some published (usually earlier) music places the numeral &quot;&quot; above the rest to confirm the extent of the rest.

Occasionally in manuscripts and facsimiles of them, bars of rest are sometimes left completely empty and unmarked, possibly even without the staves.
=== Multiple measure rests ===
In instrumental parts, rests of more than one bar in the same meter and key may be indicated with a multimeasure rest (British English: multiple bar rest), showing the number of bars of rest, as shown. A multimeasure rest is usually drawn in one of two ways:
* As a thick horizontal line placed on the middle line of the staff, with serifs at both ends (see above middle picture), or as thick diagonal lines placed between the second and fourth lines of the staff, resembling a large heavy minus sign or equals sign set at a slant (the diagonal style is much less common than the horizontal one; although a small number of publishers use it, it is more commonly found in modern manuscripts in a casual style). Both variants of thick line rests are drawn in the same shape each time, regardless of how many bars&#x27; rest they represent.
* The older system of notating multirests (deriving from Baroque notation conventions that were adapted from the old mensural rest system dating from Medieval times) draws each multimeasure rest according to the picture above right unless it will exceed a certain number of bars; rests longer than that limit are drawn using the thick horizontal line mentioned above. How long a multimeasure rest must be before resorting to a horizontal line is a matter of personal taste or editorial policy; most publishers use ten bars as the changing point, however, larger and smaller changing points are used, especially in earlier music.

The number of bars for which a horizontal line multimeasure rest lasts is indicated by a number printed above the musical staff (usually at the same size as the numerals in a time signature). If a change of meter or key occurs during a multimeasure rest, that rest must be divided into shorter sections for clarity, with the changes of key and/or meter indicated between the rests. Multimeasure rests must also be divided at double barlines, which demarcate musical phrases or sections, and at rehearsal letters.

=== Dotted rests ===
A rest may also have a dot after it, increasing its duration by half, but this is less commonly used than with notes, except occasionally in modern music notated in compound meters such as or . In these meters the long-standing convention has been to indicate one beat of rest as a quarter rest followed by an eighth rest (equivalent to three eighths). See: Anacrusis.

=== General pause ===
In a score for an ensemble piece, &quot;G.P.&quot; (&quot;general pause&quot;) indicates silence for one bar or more for the entire ensemble. Specifically marking general pauses each time they occur (rather than writing them as ordinary rests) is relevant for performers, as making any kind of noise should be avoided there—for instance, page turns in sheet music are not made during general pauses, as the sound of turning the page becomes noticeable when no one is playing.
