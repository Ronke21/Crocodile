<text>Eduardo Chillida Juantegui (Basque: &quot;Eduardo Txillida Juantegi&quot;; 10 January 1924 – 19 August 2002) was a Spanish Basque sculptor notable for his abstract works.

==Early life and career==
Born in San Sebastián (Donostia) to Pedro Chillida and the soprano Carmen Juantegui on 10 January 1924. Eduardo Chillida grew up near hotel &quot;Biarritz&quot;, which was owned by his grandparents. Chillida had been the goalkeeper for Real Sociedad, San Sebastián&#x27;s La Liga football team, where his knee was so seriously injured that he had five surgeries, ending a promising football career. He then studied architecture at the University of Madrid from 1943 to 1946. In 1947 he abandoned architecture for art, and the next year he moved to Paris, where he set up his first studio and began working in plaster and clay. He never finished his degree and instead began to take private art lessons. He lived in Paris from 1948 to 50 and at Villaines-sous-Bois (Seine-et-Oise) from 1950 to 1955. In 1950 Chillida married Pilar Belzunce and later returned to the San Sebastián area, first to the nearby village of Hernani and in 1959 to the city of his birth, where he remained.

He died at his home near San Sebastián at the age of 78.

==Work==
Chillida&#x27;s sculptures concentrated on the human form (mostly torsos and busts); his later works tended to be more massive and more abstract, and included many monumental public works. Chillida himself tended to reject the label of &quot;abstract&quot;, preferring instead to call himself a &quot;realist sculptor&quot;. Upon returning to the Basque Country in 1951, Chillida soon abandoned the plaster he used in his Paris works – a medium suited to his study of archaic figurative works in the Louvre. Living near Hernani, he began to work in forged iron with the help of the local blacksmith, and soon set up a forge in his studio. From 1954 until 1966, Chillida worked on a series entitled &quot;Anvil of Dreams&quot;, in which he used wood for the first time as a base from which the metal forms rise up in explosive rhythmic curves. He began to make sculpture in alabaster 1965. Rather than turn over a maquette of a sculpture to fabricators, as many modern artists do, Chillida worked closely with the men in the foundry. He then usually added an alloy that caused the metal to take on a brilliant rust color as it oxidizes.

From quite early on, Chillida&#x27;s sculpture found public recognition, and, in 1954, he produced the four doors for the basilica of Arantzazu, where works by other leading Basque sculptors – Jorge Oteiza, Agustin Ibarrola and Nestor Basterretxea – were also being installed. The following year, he carved a stone monument to the discoverer of penicillin, Sir Alexander Fleming, for a park in San Sebastián (it subsequently disappeared, but a new version has been installed on the promenade at San Sebastián bay). By the early 1970s, his steel sculptures had been installed in front of the Unesco headquarters in Paris, the ThyssenKrupp building in Düsseldorf, and in a courtyard at the World Bank offices in Washington

At their best his works, although massive and monumental, suggest movement and tension. For example, the largest of his works in the United States, &quot;De Musica&quot; is an 81-ton steel sculpture featuring two pillars with arms that reach out but do not touch. Much of Chillida&#x27;s work is inspired by his Basque upbringing, and many of his sculptures&#x27; titles are in the Basque language Euskera. His steel sculpture &quot;De Música III&quot; was exhibited at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in the UK, as part of a retrospective of Chillida&#x27;s work.

Chillida&#x27;s cast iron sculpture &quot;Topos V&quot; has been displayed in Plaça del Rei, Barcelona, since 1986.

Chillida also conceived a distinguished oeuvre of etchings, lithographs and woodcuts since 1959, including illustrations for Jorge Guillen&#x27;s &quot;Mas Alla&quot; (1973) and various other books.

===&quot;Monument to Tolerance&quot;, Fuerteventura===
According to Chillida&#x27;s plans for a &quot;Monument of Tolerance&quot;, an artificial cave is to be bored into the mountain. The huge cubic cave, measuring 40 metres (131 ft) along each side, is to be dug from inside a mountain that has long been revered by the inhabitants of the dusty, barren island to the south of Lanzarote. About 64,000 cubic metres of rock will be taken away from the mountain, which rises out of an arid landscape in the north of the island, to create what Chillida called his &#x27;monument to tolerance&#x27;. Chillida&#x27;s original idea was for visitors to experience the immensity of the space.

The project has been in development since 1994, eight years before Chillida&#x27;s death. In 2011 local authorities decided to go ahead with a project by Chillida inside Mount Tindaya on Fuerteventura despite concerns from environmentalists. As of 2013, local officials are continuing to seek €75 million in private funding.

===Dialogue with Heidegger===
In the early 1960s Eduardo Chillida engaged in a dialog with the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. When the two men met, they discovered that from different angles, they were &quot;working with space&quot; in the same way. Heidegger wrote: &quot;We would have to learn to recognize that things themselves are places and do not merely belong to a place,&quot; and that sculpture is thereby &quot;...the embodiment of places.&quot; Against a traditional view of space as an empty container for discrete bodies, these writings understand the body as already beyond itself in a world of relations and conceive of space as a material medium of relational contact. Sculpture shows us how we belong to the world, a world in the midst of a technological process of uprooting and homelessness. Heidegger suggests how we can still find room to dwell therein.

Chillida has been quoted as saying: &quot;My whole Work is a journey of discovery in Space. Space is the liveliest of all, the one that surrounds us. ...I do not believe so much in experience. I think it is conservative. I believe in perception, which is something else. It is riskier and more progressive. There is something that still wants to progress and grow. Also, this is what I think makes you perceive, and perceiving directly acts upon the present, but with one foot firmly planted in the future. Experience, on the other hand, does the contrary: you are in the present, but with one foot in the past. In other words, I prefer the position of perception. All of my work is the progeny of the question. I am a specialist in asking questions, some without answers.&quot;

Other philosophers who have written respectfully about Chillida and his works include Gaston Bachelard and Octavio Paz.

==Exhibitions==
Chillida exhibited his early work in 1949 in the Salon de Mai at the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris, and the next year took part in &quot;Les Mains Eblouies&quot;, a show of postwar art at the Galerie Maeght. After his first solo exhibition at the Clan Gallery in Madrid in 1954, Chillida exhibited his work in more than 100 one-man shows. He also participated in many international exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale (1958, 1988 and 1990); the Pittsburgh International, where he received the Carnegie Prize for sculpture in 1964 and, in 1978, shared the Andrew W. Mellon Prize with Willem de Kooning; and Documenta II, IV and VI. His first comprehensive retrospective in the United States was mounted by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, in 1966. Major retrospectives of Chillida&#x27;s graphic and sculptural work have since been mounted by the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. (1979), Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (1980), Palacio de Miramar in San Sebastián (1992); and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid (1999) and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain (1999).

==Major public works==
Major public works by Chillida are in Barcelona, Berlin, Paris, Frankfurt and Dallas. A large body of his work can be seen in San Sebastián. One, &quot;Haizeen orrazia&quot; (&quot;The Comb of the Wind&quot;) a collaboration with Luis Peña Ganchegui, is installed on rocks rising from the Cantabrian Sea at &quot;La Concha&quot; bay in Sebastián. Perhaps his best-known work in the United States is in front of the I.M. Pei-designed Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas. &quot;De Musica&quot; features two pillars with branches that reach out but do not touch. In Washington, a Chillida sculpture is inside the World Bank headquarters. In 1997, a sculpture by Chillida was also on extended loan from Tasende Gallery outside Beverly Hills City Hall, on occasion of Tasende Gallery opening their Los Angeles showroom with a solo presentation by Chillida. In 1986, he installed &quot;House of Goethe,&quot; a large piece that is a tribute to the German poet and dramatist, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in the city of Frankfurt. His monument &quot;Diálogo-Tolerancia (Dialogue-Tolerance)&quot; was installed in Münster in 1993 to celebrate the Peace of Westfalia. Chillida&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Berlin&quot; (2000) for the Federal Chancellery (Berlin) is interpreted as a symbol of German reunification: two crossing hands create a common – in a sense spiritual – place.

==Collections==
Chillida&#x27;s sculptures have been collected by major museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Tate Britain in London; the Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland; and the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. In 1986 the Chillida collection of the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid was inaugurated; Chillida designed the museum&#x27;s logo.

===Chillida Leku===
In the early 1980s Chillida and his wife bought a sixteenth century Basque farmhouse and surrounding land at Hernani near San Sebastián to establish a permanent place to display his work in a natural environment. This opened in the 1990s as &quot;Chillida Leku&quot;, an open-air museum where visitors could wander among the sculptures. The museum closed by 2011 but reopened in 2019 with the backing of Hauser &amp; Wirth, a Swiss modern art gallery. &quot;Leku&quot; means &#x27;place&#x27; in Basque.

==Honours and awards==

In 2002, Vitoria-Gasteiz, the capital of the Basque country, awarded its gold medal, the city&#x27;s highest honor, posthumously to Chillida and the architect Luis Peña Ganchegui, for building a square that has come to symbolize Basque re-emergence following Spain&#x27;s return to democracy. Other honours include:
*(1998) Recipient of the Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award International Sculpture Center
*(1991) Recipient of the Praemium Imperiale in Sculpture
*(1987) Recipient of the Premio Príncipe de Asturias de las Artes
*(1985) Recipient of the Wolf Prize in Sculpture
*(1983) Elected an honorary academician by the Royal Academy
*(1998) Elected an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Sculptors

==Art market==
Since 2018, Chillida&#x27;s estate has been represented by Hauser &amp; Wirth. It previously worked with Pilar Ordovas. Tasende Gallery was the solo US representative of Chillida from the mid 1980s through the 1990s.Tasende Gallery’s representation, including several shows arranged with museums and commercial galleries in the US, presentations at numerous art fairs in the US, Europe and Japan, an extensive advertising campaign, monograph publications and symposiums served to widely introduce Eduardo Chillida to the American art market.

In 2006, Chillida&#x27;s classic 1961 sculpture, &quot;Rumor de Limites&quot;, more than doubled estimates to sell to a collector from the Iberian Peninsula for a record £2 million in London. His corten steel sculpture &quot;Buscando La Luz IV (Looking for the Light IV)&quot; (2001) was sold for 4.1 million pounds at Christie&#x27;s London in 2013.

<doc id="571538" wikidata="Q844460" url="?curid=571538" title="Syncytium">
<text>A syncytium (; : syncytia; from Greek: σύν &quot;syn&quot; &quot;together&quot; and κύτος &quot;kytos&quot; &quot;box, i.e. cell&quot;) or symplasm is a multinucleate cell that can result from multiple cell fusions of uninuclear cells (i.e., cells with a single nucleus), in contrast to a coenocyte, which can result from multiple nuclear divisions without accompanying cytokinesis. The muscle cell that makes up animal skeletal muscle is a classic example of a syncytium cell. The term may also refer to cells interconnected by specialized membranes with gap junctions, as seen in the heart muscle cells and certain smooth muscle cells, which are synchronized electrically in an action potential.

The field of embryogenesis uses the word &quot;syncytium&quot; to refer to the coenocytic blastoderm embryos of invertebrates, such as &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.

==Physiological examples==
===Protists===
In protists, syncytia can be found in some rhizarians (e.g., chlorarachniophytes, plasmodiophorids, haplosporidians) and acellular slime moulds, dictyostelids (amoebozoans), acrasids (Excavata) and Haplozoon.

===Plants===
Some examples of plant syncytia, which result during plant development, include:
*Developing endosperm
*The non-articulated laticifers
*The plasmodial tapetum, and
*The &quot;nucellar plasmodium&quot; of the family Podostemaceae

===Fungi===
A syncytium is the normal cell structure for many fungi. Most fungi of Basidiomycota exist as a dikaryon in which thread-like cells of the mycelium are partially partitioned into segments each containing two differing nuclei, called a heterokaryon.

===Animals===

====Nerve net====
The neurons which makes up the subepithelial nerve net in comb jellies (Ctenophora) are fused into a neural syncytium, consisting of a continuous plasma membrane instead of being connected through synapses.

====Skeletal muscle====
A classic example of a syncytium is the formation of skeletal muscle. Large skeletal muscle fibers form by the fusion of thousands of individual muscle cells. The multinucleated arrangement is important in pathologic states such as myopathy, where focal necrosis (death) of a portion of a skeletal muscle fiber does not result in necrosis of the adjacent sections of that same skeletal muscle fiber, because those adjacent sections have their own nuclear material. Thus, myopathy is usually associated with such &quot;segmental necrosis&quot;, with some of the surviving segments being functionally cut off from their nerve supply via loss of continuity with the neuromuscular junction.

====Cardiac muscle====
The syncytium of cardiac muscle is important because it allows rapid coordinated contraction of muscles along their entire length. Cardiac action potentials propagate along the surface of the muscle fiber from the point of synaptic contact through intercalated discs. Although a syncytium, cardiac muscle differs because the cells are not long and multinucleated. Cardiac tissue is therefore described as a functional syncytium, as opposed to the true syncytium of skeletal muscle.

====Smooth muscle====
Smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract is activated by a composite of three types of cells – smooth muscle cells (SMCs), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) that are electrically coupled and work together as an SIP functional syncytium.

====Osteoclasts====
Certain animal immune-derived cells may form aggregate cells, such as the osteoclast cells responsible for bone resorption.

====Placenta====
Another important vertebrate syncytium is in the placenta of placental mammals. Embryo-derived cells that form the interface with the maternal blood stream fuse together to form a multinucleated barrier – the syncytiotrophoblast. This is probably important to limit the exchange of migratory cells between the developing embryo and the body of the mother, as some blood cells are specialized to be able to insert themselves between adjacent epithelial cells. The syncytial epithelium of the placenta does not provide such an access path from the maternal circulation into the embryo.

====Glass sponges====
Much of the body of Hexactinellid sponges is composed of syncitial tissue. This allows them to form their large siliceous spicules exclusively inside their cells.

====Tegument====

The fine structure of the tegument in helminths is essentially the same in both the cestodes and trematodes. A typical tegument is 7–16 μm thick, with distinct layers. It is a syncytium consisting of multinucleated tissues with no distinct cell boundaries. The outer zone of the syncytium, called the &quot;distal cytoplasm,&quot; is lined with a plasma membrane. This plasma membrane is in turn associated with a layer of carbohydrate-containing macromolecules known as the glycocalyx, that varies in thickness from one species to another. The distal cytoplasm is connected to the inner layer called the &quot;proximal cytoplasm&quot;, which is the &quot;cellular region or cyton or perikarya&quot; through cytoplasmic tubes that are composed of microtubules. The proximal cytoplasm contains nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, mitochondria, ribosomes, glycogen deposits, and numerous vesicles. The innermost layer is bounded by a layer of connective tissue known as the &quot;basal lamina&quot;. The basal lamina is followed by a thick layer of muscle.

==Pathological examples==

===Viral infection===

Syncytia can also form when cells are infected with certain types of viruses, notably HSV-1, HIV, MeV, SARS-CoV-2, and pneumoviruses, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These syncytial formations create distinctive cytopathic effects when seen in permissive cells. Because many cells fuse together, syncytia are also known as multinucleated cells, giant cells, or polykaryocytes. During infection, viral fusion proteins used by the virus to enter the cell are transported to the cell surface, where they can cause the host cell membrane to fuse with neighboring cells.

==== Reoviridae ====
Typically, the viral families that can cause syncytia are enveloped, because viral envelope proteins on the surface of the host cell are needed to fuse with other cells. Certain members of the Reoviridae family are notable exceptions due to a unique set of proteins known as fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins. Reovirus induced syncytium formation is not found in humans, but is found in a number of other species and is caused by fusogenic orthoreoviruses. These fusogenic orthoreoviruses include reptilian orthoreovirus, avian orthoreovirus, Nelson Bay orthoreovirus, and baboon orthoreovirus.

==== HIV ====
HIV infects Helper CD4+ T cells and makes them produce viral proteins, including fusion proteins. Then, the cells begin to display surface HIV glycoproteins, which are antigenic. Normally, a cytotoxic T cell will immediately come to &quot;inject&quot; lymphotoxins, such as perforin or granzyme, that will kill the infected T helper cell. However, if T helper cells are nearby, the gp41 HIV receptors displayed on the surface of the T helper cell will bind to other similar lymphocytes. This makes dozens of T helper cells fuse cell membranes into a giant, nonfunctional syncytium, which allows the HIV virion to kill many T helper cells by infecting only one. It is associated with a faster progression of the disease

==== Mumps ====
The mumps virus uses HN protein to stick to a potential host cell, then, the fusion protein allows it to bind with the host cell. The HN and fusion proteins are then left on the host cell walls, causing it to bind with neighbour epithelial cells.

====COVID-19====
Mutations within SARS-CoV-2 variants contain spike protein variants that can enhance syncytia formation. The protease TMPRSS2 is essential for syncytia formation. Syncytia can allow the virus to spread directly to other cells, shielded from neutralizing antibodies and other immune system components. Syncytia formation in cells can be pathological to tissues.

&quot;Severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with extensive lung damage and the presence of infected multinucleated syncytial pneumocytes. The viral and cellular mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia are not well understood,&quot; but membrane cholesterol seems necessary.

The syncytia appear to be long-lasting; the &quot;complete regeneration&quot; of the lungs after severe flu &quot;does not happen&quot; with COVID-19.

<text>The Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour is a two-shaft low bypass turbofan aircraft engine developed by Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Limited, a joint venture between Rolls-Royce (UK) and Turbomeca (France). The engine is named after the Adour, a river in south western France.

== History ==
The Adour is a turbofan engine developed primarily to power the Anglo-French SEPECAT Jaguar fighter-bomber, achieving its first successful test run in 1968. It is produced in versions with or without reheat.

As of July 2009 more than 2,800 Adours have been produced, for over 20 different armed forces with total flying hours reaching 8 million in December 2009. The U.S. military designation for this engine is the F405-RR-401 (a derivative of the Adour Mk 871), which is currently used to power the fleet of Boeing / BAE Systems T-45 Goshawk trainer jets of the United States Navy.

== Variants ==
; Bench engines
: Ten prototype engines were built for testing by both Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca.

; Flight development engines
: Development engines for the Jaguar prototypes, 25 built.

=== Reheated (afterburning) ===

* Adour Mk 101 - First production variant for the Jaguar, 40 built.
* Adour Mk 102 - Second production variant with the addition of part-throttle reheat.
* Adour Mk 104 - Much more powerful version available in early 1980s, with higher operating temperature (700° vs 640), capable of about 5,500 lb. dry and 8,000 lb. with max A/B (static). While it was only marginally better in military thrust at take off, this engine improved the Jaguar’s low power-to weight ratio and enabled much better performance, with 10% more thrust at take off (with after burner engaged), and up to 27% more thrust in high subsonic cruise, helping the Jaguar in its typical flight envelope (low level, high speed attack). 
* Adour Mk 106 - Replacement for the Jaguar&#x27;s Mk104 engine (developed from the Adour 871) with a reheat section. The RAF refitted its fleet with this engine as part of the GR3 upgrade. In May 2007, following the retirement of the last 16 Jaguars from No. 6 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Coningsby, the Adour 106 has been phased out of RAF service.
* Adour Mk 801 - For Mitsubishi F-1 &amp; T-2 (JASDF)
* TF40-IHI-801A - Licence-built version of Mk 801 by Ishikawajima-Harima for Mitsubishi F-1 &amp; T-2 (JASDF)
* Adour Mk 804 - Licence-built by HAL for Indian Air Force phase 2 Jaguars
* Adour Mk 811 - Licence-built by HAL for Indian Air Force phase 3 to 6 Jaguars; rated at 8400 lbs of maximum thrust. BAe-built Jaguars were initially powered with two Adour 804E turbofans.
* Adour Mk 821 - Engine upgrade of Mk804 and Mk811 engines, was under development for the Indian Air Force Jaguar aircraft.

=== Dry (non-afterburning) ===
* Adour Mk 151-01 Used by the Royal Air Force training aircraft fleet
* Adour Mk 151-02 - Used by the Red Arrows
* Adour Mk 851
* Adour Mk 861
* Adour Mk 871 - Used by Hawk 200
* F405-RR-401 - Similar configuration to Mk 871, for US Navy T-45 Goshawk.
* Adour Mk 951 - Designed for the latest versions of the BAE Hawk and powering the BAE Taranis and Dassault nEUROn UCAV technology demonstrators. The Adour Mk 951 is a more fundamental redesign than the Adour Mk 106, with improved performance (rated at thrust) and up to twice the service life of the 871. It features an all-new fan and combustor, revised HP and LP turbines, and introduces Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). The Mk 951 was certified in 2005.
* F405-RR-402 - Upgrade of F405-RR-401, incorporating Mk 951 technology, certified 2008. Did not enter into service due to funding issues.

===Higher bypass===
* A high-bypass engine built around the core of the Adour and intended as a Spey replacement was developed by Rolls-Royce in 1967 as the Rolls-Royce RB.203 Trent.

== Applications ==
* Aermacchi MB-338 (not-built)
* BAE Hawk
* BAE Taranis (UCAV development aircraft)
* Dassault nEUROn (UCAV development aircraft)
* McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk
* SEPECAT Jaguar

=== Licence-built ===
; Ishikawajima-Harima TF40-IHI-801A
* Mitsubishi F-1
* Mitsubishi T-2

== Engines on display ==
* A Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour is on public display at the City of Norwich Aviation Museum in Horsham St Faith, Norfolk.
* A Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour Mk.151-01 is on display at the South Yorkshire Aircraft Museum, Doncaster. The engine is displayed alongside an ex-RAF Hawk T.1 &quot;XX238&quot;.

<text>Rahul Dev Burman (; 27 June 1939 – 4 January 1994) was an Indian music director and actor, who is considered to be one of the greatest and most successful music directors of the Hindi film music industry. From the 1960s to the 1990s, Burman composed musical scores for 331 films, bringing a new level of music ensemble with his compositions. Burman did his major work with legendary singers Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar, and Asha Bhosle. He also worked extensively with lyricist Gulzar, with whom he has some of the most memorable numbers in his career. Nicknamed Pancham, he was the only son of the composer Sachin Dev Burman and his Bengali lyricist wife Meera Dev Burman.

He was mainly active in the Hindi film industry as a composer, and also provided vocals for a few compositions. He served as an influence to the next generation of Indian music directors, and his songs continue to be popular in India and overseas. Many years after his death, his songs continued to be inspiration for new singers and composers.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Burman was born to the Hindi film composer and singer, Sachin Dev Burman, and his lyricist wife Meera Dev Burman (née Dasgupta), in Calcutta. Initially, he was nicknamed Tublu by his maternal grandmother, although he later became known by the nickname Pancham. According to some stories, he was nicknamed &quot;Pancham&quot; because, as a child, whenever he cried, it sounded in the fifth note (&quot;Pa&quot;), G note on c major scale, of music notation; in Hindustani Classical Music, &quot;Pancham&quot; is the name of the fifth scale degree: (IAST: Ṣaḍja, Ṛṣabha, Gandhāra, Madhyama, Pañcama, Dhaivata, Niṣāda). Another theory says that the baby was nicknamed Pancham because he could cry in five different notes. Yet another version is that when the veteran Indian actor Ashok Kumar saw a newborn Rahul uttering the syllable &quot;Pa&quot; repeatedly, he nicknamed the boy &quot;Pancham&quot;.

Burman received his early education in West Bengal from Ballygunge Government High School in Kolkata. His father S. D. Burman was a noted music director in Hindi language films, the Mumbai-based Hindi film industry. When he was seventeen years old, R. D. Burman composed his first song, &quot;Aye meri topi palat ke aa&quot;, which his father used in the film &quot;Funtoosh&quot; (1956). The tune of the song &quot;Sar jo tera chakraaye&quot; was also composed by him as a child; his father included it in the soundtrack of Guru Dutt&#x27;s &quot;Pyaasa&quot; (1957).

In Mumbai, Burman was trained by Ustad Ali Akbar Khan (sarod) and Samta Prasad (tabla). He also considered Salil Chowdhury his guru. He served as an assistant to his father and often played harmonica in his orchestras.

Some of the notable films in which Burman is credited as the music assistant include &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot; (1958), &quot;Kaagaz Ke Phool&quot; (1959), &quot;Tere Ghar Ke Samne&quot; (1963), &quot;Bandini&quot; (1963), &quot;Ziddi&quot; (1964), &quot;Guide&quot; (1965) and &quot;Teen Devian&quot; (1965). Burman also played mouth organ for his father&#x27;s hit composition &quot;Hai Apna Dil To Aawara&quot;, which was featured in the film &quot;Solva Saal&quot;, and sung by Hemanta Mukhopadhyay.

In 1959, Burman signed up as a music director for the film &quot;Raaz&quot;, directed by Guru Dutt&#x27;s assistant Niranjan. However, the film was never completed. The lyrics of this Guru Dutt and Waheeda Rehman-starrer film were written by Shailendra. Burman recorded two songs for the film before it was shelved. The first song was sung by Geeta Dutt and Asha Bhosle, and the second one had vocals by Shamshad Begum.

Burman&#x27;s first released film as an independent music director was &quot;Chhote Nawab&quot; (1961). When the noted Hindi film comedian Mehmood decided to produce &quot;Chhote Nawab&quot;, he first approached Burman&#x27;s father Sachin Dev Burman for the music. However, S. D. Burman declined the offer, advising he was unavailable. At this meeting, Mehmood noticed Rahul playing tabla, and signed him as the music director for &quot;Chhote Nawab&quot;. Burman later developed a close association with Mehmood, and made a cameo in Mehmood&#x27;s &quot;Bhoot Bangla&quot; (1965).

=== Personal life ===
Burman&#x27;s first wife was Rita Patel, whom he had met in Darjeeling. Rita, a fan, had bet her friends that she would be able to get a film-date with Burman. They two married in 1966, and divorced in 1971. The song &quot;Musafir Hoon Yaaron&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m a Traveller&quot;) from &quot;Parichay&quot; (1972) was composed while he was at a hotel after the separation.

Burman married Asha Bhosle in 1980. Together, they recorded many hit songs and also staged many live performances. However, towards the end of his life, they did not live together. Burman had financial difficulties, particularly later in his life. His mother Meera died in 2007, thirteen years after his death. She had been suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s even before her son&#x27;s death. Just before her death she had been moved to an old age home, and moved back to her son&#x27;s residence after the issue became a controversy.

=== Death ===
R.D. Burman died on 4 January 1994 because of a heart attack. Burman had been a patient of a Cardiovascular disease for around 6 years before his death and even underwent a surgery because of an earlier heart attack in 1988.

== Music career ==
=== 1961–1969: Early career ===

R. D. Burman began his career as a music director with the 1961 film &quot;Chhote Nawab&quot;, which proved to be a lukewarm success and so his next three ventures, &quot;Bhoot Bungla&quot; (1965), &quot;Teesra Kaun&quot; (1965) and &quot;Pati Patni&quot; (1966). He established himself with Vijay Anand&#x27;s musical mystery film &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot; (1966), which had Shammi Kapoor and Asha Parekh in the lead. It went on to become a huge success at the box office which was attributed to its superhit songs, &quot;O Haseena Zulfonwali Jane Jahan&quot;, &quot;O Mere Sona Re Sona&quot;, &quot;Aaja Aaja Main Hoon Pyar Tera&quot;, &quot;Deewana Mujhsa Nahin&quot; and &quot;Tumne Mujhe Dekha Hokar Meherban&quot;, all of which got featured in the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala. Also the soundtrack of &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot; proved to be the seventh best-selling Hindi film album of the 1960s.

Burman&#x27;s other notable work of the decade was the musical comedy &quot;Padosan&quot; (1968), whose songs like &quot;Ek Chatur Naar&quot;, &quot;Mere Samne Wali Khidki Mein&quot;, &quot;Mere Bhole Balam&quot; and &quot;Kehna Hai Kehna Hai&quot; remain popular till date and played a major part in making the film a commercial success. In 1969, while working as an assistant to his father in Shakti Samanta&#x27;s &quot;Aradhana&quot;, he played an instrumental role in making Kishore Kumar the playback voice of Rajesh Khanna, who became a superstar with the film&#x27;s blockbuster success and same for Kumar whose singing career got a major boost and he became the leading playback singer of Hindi cinema and remained at that position till his death in 1987.

=== 1970–1977: Rise to prominence and immense success ===

Burman emerged as the leading music director of Hindi cinema in the year 1970 with Shakti Samanta&#x27;s musical romantic drama &quot;Kati Patang&quot; starring Rajesh Khanna and Asha Parekh. At the box office, it went on to become a blockbuster with almost all of its songs, such as &quot;Yeh Shaam Mastani&quot;, &quot;Pyaar Deewana Hota Hai&quot;, &quot;Yeh Jo Mohabbat Hai&quot;, all three solos by Kishore Kumar and &quot;Jis Gali Mein Tera Ghar&quot;, a solo by Mukesh proving to be chartbuster and playing an important role in the box office success of the film and making its soundtrack one of the highest-selling Bollywood album of the 1970s. The same year, he also delivered music in another Rajesh Khanna hit &quot;The Train&quot;, which had the popular songs &quot;Gulabi Aankhen&quot;, a solo by Mohammed Rafi and &quot;Kis Liye Maine Pyar Kiya&quot;, a solo by Lata Mangeshkar.

For the next three years he worked in highly successful films, such as &quot;Haré Rama Haré Krishna&quot; (1971), &quot;Caravan&quot; (1971), &quot;Amar Prem&quot; (1972), &quot;Mere Jeevan Saathi&quot; (1972), &quot;Apna Desh&quot; (1972), &quot;Jawani Diwani&quot; (1972), &quot;Raampur Ka Lakshman&quot; (1972), &quot;Parichay&quot; (1972), &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot; (1972), &quot;Samadhi&quot; (1972), &quot;Heera Panna&quot; (1973), &quot;Anamika&quot; (1973), &quot;Aa Gale Lag Jaa&quot; (1973), &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; (1973) and &quot;Namak Haraam&quot; (1973), all of which had superhit songs like &quot;Chadti Jawani Meri Chaal Mastani&quot;, &quot;Piya Tu Ab To Aaja&quot; and &quot;Kitna Pyara Wada Hai&quot; (&quot;Caravan&quot;), &quot;Dum Maro Dum&quot;, &quot;Phoolon Ka Taron Ka&quot; and &quot;Kanchi Re Kanchi&quot; (&quot;Hare Rama Hare Krishna&quot;), &quot;Raina Beeti Jaye&quot;, &quot;Chingari Koi Bhadke&quot;, &quot;Kuchh Toh Log Kahenge&quot; and &quot;Yeh Kya Hua&quot; (&quot;Amar Prem&quot;), &quot;O Mere Dil Ke Chain&quot;, &quot;Chala Jaata Hoon&quot; and &quot;Aao Na, Gale Laga Lo Na&quot; (&quot;Mere Jeevan Saathi&quot;), &quot;Duniya Mein Logon Ko&quot;, &quot;Kajra Lagake Gajra Sajake&quot; and &quot;Ro Na Kabhi Nahin Rona&quot; (&quot;Apna Desh&quot;), &quot;Samne Yeh Kaun Aaya&quot;, &quot;Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani&quot; and &quot;Jaan-E-Jaan Dhoondta Phir Raha Hoon Tumhe Raat Din&quot; (&quot;Jawani Diwani&quot;), &quot;Gum Hai Kisi Ke Pyar Mein Dil Subah Sham&quot; and &quot;Rampur Ka Vasi Hoon&quot; (&quot;Raampur Ka Lakshman&quot;), &quot;Musafir Hoon Yaaron&quot; and &quot;Sa Re Ke Sa Re&quot; (&quot;Parichay&quot;), &quot;O Saathi Chal&quot; and &quot;Koi Ladki Mujhe Kal Raat&quot; (&quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot;), &quot;Kaanta Laga&quot;, &quot;Jab Tak Rahe&quot; and &quot;Jaan-E-Jaana Jao&quot; (&quot;Samadhi&quot;), &quot;Panna Ki Tamanna&quot; (&quot;Heera Panna&quot;), &quot;Meri Bheegi Bheegi Si&quot; and &quot;Bahon Mein Chale Aao&quot; (&quot;Anamika&quot;), &quot;Vaada Karo&quot; and &quot;Tera Mujhse Hain Pehle Ka Nata Koi&quot; (&quot;Aa Gale Lag Jaa&quot;), &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat Nikli Hai Aaj Dil Ke Dwaare&quot;, &quot;Chura Liya Hai Tumne Jo Dil Ko, Nazar Nahin Churana Sanam&quot;, &quot;Lekar Hum Deewana Dil, Phirte Hai Manzil Manzil&quot; and &quot;Meri Soni, Meri Tamanna, Jhuth Nahin Hai Mera Pyar&quot; (&quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot;), &quot;Diye Jalte Hain Phool Khilte Hain&quot; and &quot;Main Shair Badnaam&quot; (&quot;Namak Haraam&quot;). The soundtrack of &quot;Caravan&quot; proved to be one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s while that of &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; emerged as the second best-selling Hindi film album of the decade. For &quot;Caravan&quot;, &quot;Amar Prem&quot; and &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot;, Burman received three consecutive nominations at Filmfare for Best Music Direction. In 1974, his notable ventures, included &quot;Aap Ki Kasam&quot;, &quot;Ajanabee&quot;, &quot;Phir Kab Milogi&quot; and &quot;Zehreela Insaan&quot;, all of which had evergreen songs like &quot;Karvatein Badalte Rahe&quot;, &quot;Jai Jai Shiv Shankar&quot;, &quot;Suno Kaho Kaha Suna&quot;, &quot;Zindagi Ke Safar Mein, &quot;Ek Ajanabee Haseena Se&quot;, &quot;Hum Dono Do Premi&quot;, &quot;Bheegi Bheegi Raaton Mein&quot;, &quot;Kahin Karti Hogi&quot; and &quot;O Hansini&quot;.

Burman&#x27;s peak came in 1975 when he scored music for &quot;Deewaar&quot;, &quot;Khel Khel Mein&quot;, &quot;Warrant&quot;, &quot;Aandhi&quot;, &quot;Khushboo&quot;, &quot;Dharam Karam&quot; and &quot;Sholay&quot;, all of which were hugely successful at the box office, especially &quot;Sholay&quot; which emerged as an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; and remains the biggest hit in the history of Indian cinema. Its songs &quot;Mehbooba Mehbooba&quot;, &quot;Yeh Dosti Hum Nahin&quot;, &quot;Haa Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot;, &quot;Koi Haseena&quot; topped the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala and made its soundtrack one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s alongwith getting Burman another nomination in the Best Music Director category at Filmfare. Other notable songs composed by him that year were - &quot;Kehdoon Tumhe Ya Chup Rahoon&quot; (&quot;Deewaar&quot;), &quot;Humne Tumko Dekha&quot;, &quot;Ek Main Aur Ek Tu, Dono Mile Is Tarah&quot;, &quot;Khullam Khulla Pyar Karenge Hum Dono&quot; (&quot;Khel Khel Mein&quot;), &quot;Sun Bhai Baarati&quot;, &quot;Ruk Jana O Jana Humse&quot; (&quot;Warrant&quot;), &quot;Tere Bina Zindagi Se&quot;, &quot;Tum Aa Gaye Ho Noor Aa Gaya&quot;, &quot;Is Mod Se Jate Hain&quot; (&quot;Aandhi&quot;), &quot;O Majhi Re Apna Kinara&quot; (&quot;Khushboo&quot;), &quot;Ek Din Bik Jayega Mati Ke Mol&quot;, &quot;Tere Humsafar Geet Hain Tere&quot; (&quot;Dharam Karam&quot;). With Rajesh Khanna losing superstardom and change of box office equation from romantic musicals to action oriented multi-starrers, Burman suffered a setback in 1976 as most of his releases that year didn&#x27;t do well commercially, with notable exceptions being &quot;Nehle Pe Dehla&quot;, &quot;Balika Badhu&quot; and &quot;Mehbooba&quot;, all three of which were successful and their songs, such as &quot;Sawan Ka Mahina Aa Gaya&quot;, &quot;Bade Acche Lagte Hain&quot; and &quot;Mere Naina Sawan Bhadon&quot; respectively were superhits. This changed the following year with Nasir Hussain&#x27;s &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Naheen&quot;, which was a musical blockbuster and had a number of chartbusters, including &quot;Bachna Ae Haseeno&quot;, &quot;Mil Gaya, Hum Ko Saathi Mil Gaya&quot;, &quot;Hai Agar Dushman Zamana, Gham Nahin&quot;, &quot;Yeh Ladka Haay Allah Kaisa Hai Deewana&quot;, &quot;Kya Hua Tera Vaada, Woh Kasam, Woh Iraada&quot;, &quot;Chand Mera Dil, Chandni Ho Tum&quot; and &quot;Tum Kya Jaano Mohabbat Kya Hai&quot;. Also its soundtrack proved to be the fourth-best selling Hindi film album of the decade. His other successful ventures that year, included &quot;Kinara&quot;, which had melodious songs &quot;Naam Hum Jayega&quot;, &quot;Ek Hi Khwab&quot; and &quot;Darling Darling&quot; whose number &quot;Aise Na Mujhe Tum Dekho&quot; was a huge hit among the masses.

===1978–1985: Competition from Laxmikant–Pyarelal and Bappi Lahiri ===

From 1978 to 1980, Burman was the music director for critically and commercially successful films like &quot;Kasme Vaade&quot; (1978), &quot;Azaad&quot; (1978), &quot;Gol Maal&quot; (1979), &quot;Nauker&quot; (1979), &quot;Khubsoorat&quot; (1980), &quot;Aanchal&quot; (1980) and &quot;Shaan&quot; (1980). The songs from these films, such as &quot;Kasme Vaade Nibhayenge Hum&quot;, &quot;Raju Chal Raju&quot;, &quot;Jaan Ki Kasam&quot;, &quot;Aanewala Pal&quot;, &quot;Gol Maal Hai Bhai Sab Gol Maal Hai&quot;, &quot;Pallo Latke Re Mharo Pallo Latke&quot;, &quot;Piya Bawri, Piya Bawri&quot;, &quot;Sun Sun Sun Didi&quot; &quot;Bhor Bhaye Panchi&quot;, &quot;Aisa Rangeen Sama&quot;, &quot;Yamma Yamma&quot;, &quot;Aate Jaate Hue Main&quot; and &quot;Jaanu Meri Jaan&quot;, topped the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala. His other hit songs in these years were - &quot;Aap Ki Aankhon Mein Kuch&quot; (&quot;Ghar&quot;), &quot;Hum Bewafaa Hargiz Na The&quot; (&quot;Shalimar&quot;), &quot;Chand Churake Laya Hoon&quot; (&quot;Devata&quot;), &quot;Rimjhim Gire Sawan&quot; (&quot;Manzil&quot;), &quot;Do Lafzon Ki Hai Dil Ki Kahani&quot; (&quot;The Great Gambler&quot;), &quot;Saawan Ke Jhoole Pade Hai&quot; (&quot;Jurmana&quot;), &quot;Maine Poochha Chand Se&quot; (&quot;Abdullah&quot;), &quot;Khatouba&quot; (&quot;Alibaba Aur 40 Chor&quot;) and &quot;Teri Hai Zameen Tera Aasman&quot; (&quot;The Burning Train&quot;).

In 1981, Burman composed music for six notable ventures which were - &quot;Love Story&quot;, &quot;Kaalia&quot;, &quot;Barsaat Ki Ek Raat&quot;, &quot;Rocky&quot;, &quot;Kudrat&quot; and &quot;Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai&quot;. The first four proved to be huge money spinners, especially &quot;Love Story&quot; which turned out to be a blockbuster with its music proving to be the second best-selling Hindi film album of the 1980s. Its songs &quot;Kaisa Tera Pyar, Kaisa Gussa Hai Tera&quot;, &quot;Dekho Maine Dekha Hai Yeh Ek Sapna&quot; and &quot;Teri Yaad Aa Rahi Hai&quot; remain popular till date. Contrary to this, &quot;Kudrat&quot; and &quot;Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai&quot; were commercial failures, but their songs like &quot;Tune O Rangeele&quot; and &quot;Hume Tumse Pyaar Kitna&quot; in the former and &quot;Hoga Tumse Pyaara Kaun&quot; and &quot;Dil Lena Khel Hai Dildar Ka&quot; in the latter were huge hits and made them two of the best-selling Bollywood albums of the decade. In 1982, his successful ventures were - &quot;Angoor&quot;, &quot;Sanam Teri Kasam&quot; and &quot;Satte Pe Satta&quot;. For &quot;Sanam Teri Kasam&quot;, Burman won his first Filmfare Best Music Director Award and also the film&#x27;s music proved to be one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1980s. However, his contemporaries, including Laxmikant–Pyarelal and Bappi Lahiri had bigger hits in their kitty, such as &quot;Prem Rog&quot;, &quot;Farz Aur Kanoon&quot; and &quot;Namak Halaal&quot;, &quot;Disco Dancer&quot;, respectively. The following year, Burman again had five major releases - &quot;Pukar&quot;, &quot;Mahaan&quot;, &quot;Betaab&quot;, &quot;Masoom&quot; and &quot;Agar Tum Na Hote&quot;, all of which had songs that dominated the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala, such as &quot;Jab Hum Jawan Honge&quot;, &quot;Teri Tasveer Mil Gayee&quot;, &quot;Lakdi Ki Kaathi Kaathi Pe Ghoda&quot;, &quot;Do Naina Aur Ek Kahani&quot;, &quot;Tujhse Naraz Nahin Zindagi&quot;, &quot;Agar Tum Na Hote&quot;, &quot;Bachke Rehna Re Baba&quot;, &quot;Pyar Mein Dil Pe Maar De Goli&quot; and &quot;Jidhar Dekhoon Teri Tasveer Nazar Aati Hai&quot;. The soundtrack of &quot;Betaab&quot; emerged as the ninth best-selling Hindi film album of the 1980s and for &quot;Masoom&quot;, Burman won his second and consecutive Filmfare Best Music Director Award.

From 1984 onwards, Burman&#x27;s career as a composer began to decline as almost all the films he composed music for in 1984 and 1985 sank without a trace with two exceptions being Ramesh Sippy&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;Saagar&quot; (1985) and Rahul Rawail&#x27;s actioner &quot;Arjun&quot; (1985), both of which had lyrics written by Javed Akhtar and had memorable songs like &quot;Chehra Hai Ya Chand Khila Hai&quot; and &quot;Saagar Kinare&quot; (&quot;Saagar&quot;), &quot;Mammaiya Kero Mamma&quot; and &quot;Dhadkan Pal Pal Badhti Jaaye&quot; (&quot;Arjun&quot;). Also the music of &quot;Saagar&quot; proved to be one of the highest-selling Bollywood albums of the decade and got him a nomination in the Best Music Director category at 33rd Filmfare Awards.

===1986–1994: Final works===

In the latter-half of the 1980s, Burman&#x27;s notable ventures, included Gulzar&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Ijaazat&quot; (1987) and Vidhu Vinod Chopra&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Parinda&quot; (1989). Both the films opened to widespread acclaim for their direction, story and songs, such as &quot;Mera Kuchh Saamaan&quot;, &quot;Qatra Qatra Milti Hai&quot; in the former and &quot;Tumse Milke Aisa Laga Tumse Milke&quot;, &quot;Kitni Hai Pyari Pyari&quot; in the latter.

After a dull beginning to the new decade with flops like &quot;Jeene Do&quot; (1990), &quot;Dushman&quot; (1990) and &quot;Indrajeet&quot; (1991), Burman delivered music in Priyadarshan&#x27;s &quot;Gardish&quot; (1993), which proved to be a box office success with hit songs like &quot;Hum Na Samjhe The&quot;, sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and &quot;Yeh Mera Dil To Pagal Hai&quot;, a duet by Balasubrahmanyam and Asha Bhosle. In 1994, he once again collaborated with Vidhu Vinod Chopra for his magnum opus &quot;1942: A Love Story&quot;. Although the film did not succeed commercially, its music was a huge chartbuster and the third best-selling Hindi film album of the 1994 with songs that remained popular such as &quot;Ek Ladki Ko Dekha&quot;, &quot;Kuchh Na Kaho&quot;, both solos by Kumar Sanu and &quot;Pyar Hua Chupke Se&quot;, sung by Kavita Krishnamurthy. Burman died a few days before the release of the film, and was posthumously awarded his third Best Music Director at the 40th Filmfare Awards.

== Style ==
Burman has been credited with revolutionizing Hindi film music. He incorporated a wide range of influences from several genres in his scores though his primary inspiration was Bengali folk. Burman&#x27;s career coincided with the rise of Rajesh Khanna-starrer youth love stories. He made electronic rock popular in these popular love stories. He often mixed disco and rock elements with Bengali folk music. He also used jazz elements, which had been introduced to him by the studio pianist Kersi Lord.

According to Douglas Wolk, Burman &quot;wrapped sugary string swoops around as many ideas as he could squeeze in at once&quot;. Biswarup Sen describes his popular music as one featuring multicultural influences, and characterized by &quot;frenetic pacing, youthful exuberance and upbeat rhythms&quot;.

Burman was influenced by Western, Latin, Oriental and Arabic music, and incorporated elements from these in his own music. He also experimented with different musical sounds produced from methods such as rubbing sandpaper and knocking bamboo sticks together. He blew into beer bottles to produce the opening beats of &quot;Mehbooba, Mehbooba&quot;. Similarly, he used cups and saucers to create the tinkling sound for the song &quot;Chura Liya Hai&quot; from the film &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; (1973). For &quot;Satte Pe Satta&quot; (1982), he made the singer Annette Pinto gargle to produce a background sound. He also rubbed a comb on a rough surface to produce a whooshing sound in the song &quot;Meri Samne Wali Khidki Main&quot; from the film &quot;Padosan&quot; (1968)

On multiple occasions, Burman experimented with recording the same song with different singers. For &quot;Kudrat&quot; (1981), he recorded the light semi-classical version of the song &quot;Hume tumse pyar kitna&quot; in the voice of Kishore Kumar, while the classical version was recorded in the voice of Parveen Sultana.

== Controversies ==

=== Plagiarism ===
Burman sometimes used Western dance music “as a source of inspiration” for his compositions. As was common in Hindi films, some of his songs featured the tunes of popular foreign songs. For example, Ramesh Sippy insisted that the tune of the traditional Cyprus song &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; (arranged and sung by Demis Roussos) be used for &quot;Mehbooba Mehbooba&quot; (&quot;Sholay&quot;, 1975), and Nasir Hussain wanted to use ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; for &quot;Mil gaya hum ko sathi&quot;. Other examples of Burman songs inspired by foreign songs including &quot;Aao twist karein&quot; from &quot;Bhoot Bangla&quot; (Chubby Checker&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Twist Again&quot;), &quot;Tumse milke&quot; (Leo Sayer&#x27;s &quot;When I Need You&quot;), and &quot;Zindagi milke bitaayenge&quot; (Paul Anka&#x27;s &quot;The Longest Day&quot;) and &quot;Jahan teri yeh nazar hai&quot; (Persian artist Zia Atabi&#x27;s &quot;Heleh maali&quot;) and &quot;Dilbar mere&quot; (Alexandra&#x27;s &quot;Zigeunerjunge&quot;).

== Legacy ==
Several Hindi films made after Burman&#x27;s death contain his original songs or their remixed versions. &quot;Dil Vil Pyar Vyar&quot; (2002), which contains several re-arranged hit songs of Burman, was made as a tribute to him. &quot;Jhankaar Beats&quot; (2003), which catapulted the music director duo Vishal–Shekhar into the limelight, is also a tribute to him. In &quot;Khwahish&quot; (2003), Mallika Sherawat&#x27;s character is a Burman fan; the film features repeated references to him. In 2010, Brahmanand Singh released a 113-minute documentary titled &quot;Pancham Unmixed: Mujhe Chalte Jaana Hai&quot;, which received critical acclaim. Pancham Unmixed won 2 National Awards and was premiered at IFFLA, Los Angeles. The film is considered a landmark in documentary biopics in India and set a trend. A coffee-table book, co-authored by Brahmanand Siingh and Gaurav Sharma titled &quot;Strings of Eternity&quot; was released with Pancham Unmixed by Shemaroo. Mobius films, the producers of Pancham Unmixed, then went on to release an extended 5 hours version titled &quot;Knowing Pancham&quot;. The launch was at prestigious venue Blue Frog in Mumbai and was graced by Manoj Bajpayee, Ashutosh Gowariker, Dolly Thakore, Sachin, Atul Tiwari, Ketan Mehta, Deepa Sahi amongst others. Brahmanand and Gaurav Sharma authored another coffee-table book with the extended version, titled &quot;Diamonds and Rust&quot;. The music of &quot;Lootera&quot; (2013) is a tribute to Burman. 
A number of Indian remix albums feature Burman&#x27;s songs, which are also popular in the country&#x27;s pubs and discos. Several of his compositions were re-mixed by the South Asian DJs in the United Kingdom and North America, and feature in popular albums such as Bally Sagoo&#x27;s &quot;Bollywood Flashback&quot;. Kronos Quartet&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Stolen My Heart&quot; (2005) contains Burman&#x27;s compositions sung by his wife Asha Bhosle. In the 2012 film &quot;Khiladi 786&quot;, Himesh Reshammiya-composed song &quot;Balma&quot; is also a tribute to R.D. Burman.

In 1995, Filmfare Awards constituted the Filmfare RD Burman Award for New Music Talent in his memory. The award is given to upcoming music talent in Hindi cinema. In 2009, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation named a public square in Santa Cruz after Burman.

Burman inspired many later Hindi film music composers, such as Vishal–Shekhar. Jatin–Lalit are considered to have carried on Burman&#x27;s legacy through the 1990s. Notable musical assistants to Burman include Manohari Singh and Sapan Chakraborty. His instrumentalists included Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Shiv Kumar Sharma, Louis Banks, Bhupinder Singh and Kersi Lord. He is also noted for his partnership with the lyricist Gulzar, who wrote the words for several of his finest compositions.

&quot;Pancham Unmixed&quot;, a winner of 2 National Awards, is a 113-minute biopic on Burman, directed by Brahmanand Singh. A postage stamp, bearing Burman&#x27;s likeness was released by India Post to honour him on 3 May 2013.

In India, &quot;Pancham Magic&quot; from Pune and Euphony from Kolkata hosts shows most likely on 4th Jan and 27 June every year with musicians, artists or otherwise worked with Burman every year. Besides this many events are celebrated in various parts of India every now or then with new talents or people who worked with Burman.

<text>A muscle cell, also known as a myocyte, is a mature contractile cell in the muscle of an animal. In humans and other vertebrates there are three types: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac (cardiomyocytes). A skeletal muscle cell is long and threadlike with many nuclei and is called a &quot;muscle fiber&quot;. Muscle cells develop from embryonic precursor cells called myoblasts.

Skeletal muscle cells form by fusion of myoblasts to produce multinucleated cells (syncytia) in a process known as myogenesis. Skeletal muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells both contain myofibrils and sarcomeres and form a striated muscle tissue.

Cardiac muscle cells form the cardiac muscle in the walls of the heart chambers, and have a single central nucleus. Cardiac muscle cells are joined to neighboring cells by intercalated discs, and when joined in a visible unit they are described as a &quot;cardiac muscle fiber&quot;.

Smooth muscle cells control involuntary movements such as the peristalsis contractions in the esophagus and stomach. Smooth muscle has no myofibrils or sarcomeres and is therefore non-striated. Smooth muscle cells have a single nucleus.

==Structure==
The unusual microscopic anatomy of a muscle cell gave rise to its terminology. The cytoplasm in a muscle cell is termed the sarcoplasm; the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of a muscle cell is termed the sarcoplasmic reticulum; and the cell membrane in a muscle cell is termed the sarcolemma. The sarcolemma receives and conducts stimuli.

===Skeletal muscle cells===
Skeletal muscle cells are the individual contractile cells within a muscle and are more usually known as muscle fibers because of their longer threadlike appearance. Broadly there are two types of muscle fiber performing in muscle contraction, either as slow twitch (type I) or fast twitch (type II).

A single muscle such as the biceps brachii in a young adult human male contains around 253,000 muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle fibers are the only muscle cells that are multinucleated with the nuclei usually referred to as myonuclei. This occurs during myogenesis with the fusion of myoblasts each contributing a nucleus to the newly formed muscle cell or myotube. Fusion depends on muscle-specific proteins known as fusogens called &quot;myomaker&quot; and &quot;myomerger&quot;.

A striated muscle fiber contains myofibrils consisting of long protein chains of myofilaments. There are three types of myofilaments: thin, thick, and elastic that work together to produce a muscle contraction. The thin myofilaments are filaments of mostly actin and the thick filaments are of mostly myosin and they slide over each other to shorten the fiber length in a muscle contraction. The third type of myofilament is an elastic filament composed of titin, a very large protein.

In striations of muscle bands, myosin forms the dark filaments that make up the A band. Thin filaments of actin are the light filaments that make up the I band. The smallest contractile unit in the fiber is called the sarcomere which is a repeating unit within two Z bands. The sarcoplasm also contains glycogen which provides energy to the cell during heightened exercise, and myoglobin, the red pigment that stores oxygen until needed for muscular activity.

The sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized type of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, forms a network around each myofibril of the muscle fiber. This network is composed of groupings of two dilated end-sacs called terminal cisternae, and a single T-tubule (transverse tubule), which bores through the cell and emerge on the other side; together these three components form the triads that exist within the network of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, in which each T-tubule has two terminal cisternae on each side of it. The sarcoplasmic reticulum serves as a reservoir for calcium ions, so when an action potential spreads over the T-tubule, it signals the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions from the gated membrane channels to stimulate muscle contraction.

In skeletal muscle, at the end of each muscle fiber, the outer layer of the sarcolemma combines with tendon fibers at the myotendinous junction. Within the muscle fiber pressed against the sarcolemma are multiply flattened nuclei; embryologically, this multinucleate condition results from multiple myoblasts fusing to produce each muscle fiber, where each myoblast contributes one nucleus.

===Cardiac muscle cells===

The cell membrane of a cardiac muscle cell has several specialized regions, which may include the intercalated disc, and transverse tubules. The cell membrane is covered by a lamina coat which is approximately 50  nm wide. The laminar coat is separable into two layers; the lamina densa and lamina lucida. In between these two layers can be several different types of ions, including calcium.

Cardiac muscle like the skeletal muscle is also striated and the cells contain myofibrils, myofilaments, and sarcomeres as the skeletal muscle cell.
The cell membrane is anchored to the cell&#x27;s cytoskeleton by anchor fibers that are approximately 10  nm wide. These are generally located at the Z lines so that they form grooves and transverse tubules emanate. In cardiac myocytes, this forms a scalloped surface.

The cytoskeleton is what the rest of the cell builds off of and has two primary purposes; the first is to stabilize the topography of the intracellular components and the second is to help control the size and shape of the cell. While the first function is important for biochemical processes, the latter is crucial in defining the surface-to-volume ratio of the cell. This heavily influences the potential electrical properties of excitable cells. Additionally, deviation from the standard shape and size of the cell can have a negative prognostic impact.

===Smooth muscle cells===

Smooth muscle cells are so-called because they have neither myofibrils nor sarcomeres and therefore no striations. They are found in the walls of hollow organs, including the stomach, intestines, bladder and uterus, in the walls of blood vessels, and in the tracts of the respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems. In the eyes, the ciliary muscles dilate and contract the iris and alter the shape of the lens. In the skin, smooth muscle cells such as those of the arrector pili cause hair to stand erect in response to cold temperature or fear.

Smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped with wide middles, and tapering ends. They have a single nucleus and range from 30 to 200 micrometers in length. This is thousands of times shorter than skeletal muscle fibers. The diameter of their cells is also much smaller which removes the need for T-tubules found in striated muscle cells. Although smooth muscle cells lack sarcomeres and myofibrils they do contain large amounts of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. Actin filaments are anchored by dense bodies (similar to the Z discs in sarcomeres) to the sarcolemma.

==Development==
A myoblast is an embryonic precursor cell that differentiates to give rise to the different muscle cell types. Differentiation is regulated by myogenic regulatory factors, including MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4. GATA4 and GATA6 also play a role in myocyte differentiation.

Skeletal muscle fibers are made when myoblasts fuse together; muscle fibers therefore are cells with multiple nuclei, known as myonuclei, with each cell nucleus originating from a single myoblast. The fusion of myoblasts is specific to skeletal muscle, and not cardiac muscle or smooth muscle.

Myoblasts in skeletal muscle that do not form muscle fibers dedifferentiate back into myosatellite cells. These satellite cells remain adjacent to a skeletal muscle fiber, situated between the sarcolemma and the basement membrane of the endomysium (the connective tissue investment that divides the muscle fascicles into individual fibers). To re-activate myogenesis, the satellite cells must be stimulated to differentiate into new fibers.

Myoblasts and their derivatives, including satellite cells, can now be generated in vitro through directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.

Kindlin-2 plays a role in developmental elongation during myogenesis.

==Function==
===Muscle contraction in striated muscle===

====Skeletal muscle contraction====
When contracting, thin and thick filaments slide concerning each other by using adenosine triphosphate. This pulls the Z discs closer together in a process called the sliding filament mechanism. The contraction of all the sarcomeres results in the contraction of the whole muscle fiber. This contraction of the myocyte is triggered by the action potential over the cell membrane of the myocyte. The action potential uses transverse tubules to get from the surface to the interior of the myocyte, which is continuous within the cell membrane.
Sarcoplasmic reticula are membranous bags that transverse tubules touch but remain separate from. These wrap themselves around each sarcomere and are filled with Ca2+.

Excitation of a myocyte causes depolarization at its synapses, the neuromuscular junctions, which triggers an action potential. With a singular neuromuscular junction, each muscle fiber receives input from just one somatic efferent neuron. Action potential in a somatic efferent neuron causes the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

When the acetylcholine is released it diffuses across the synapse and binds to a receptor on the sarcolemma, a term unique to muscle cells that refers to the cell membrane. This initiates an impulse that travels across the sarcolemma.

When the action potential reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum it triggers the release of Ca2+ from the Ca2+ channels. The Ca2+ flows from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcomere with both of its filaments. This causes the filaments to start sliding and the sarcomeres to become shorter. This requires a large amount of ATP, as it is used in both the attachment and release of every myosin head. Very quickly Ca2+ is actively transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which blocks the interaction between the thin and thick filament. This in turn causes the muscle cell to relax.

There are four main types of muscle contraction: isometric, isotonic, eccentric and concentric. Isometric contractions are skeletal muscle contractions that do not cause movement of the muscle. and isotonic contractions are skeletal muscle contractions that do cause movement. Eccentric contraction is when a muscle moves under a load. Concentric contraction is when a muscle shortens and generates force.

====Cardiac muscle contraction====

Specialized cardiomyocytes in the sinoatrial node generate electrical impulses that control the heart rate. These electrical impulses coordinate contraction throughout the remaining heart muscle via the electrical conduction system of the heart. Sinoatrial node activity is modulated, in turn, by nerve fibers of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. These systems act to increase and decrease, respectively, the rate of production of electrical impulses by the sinoatrial node.

== Evolution ==

The evolutionary origin of muscle cells in animals is highly debated: One view is that muscle cells evolved once, and thus all muscle cells have a single common ancestor. Another view is that muscles cells evolved more than once, and any morphological or structural similarities are due to convergent evolution, and the development of shared genes that predate the evolution of muscle – even the mesoderm (the &quot;mesoderm&quot; is the germ layer that gives rise to muscle cells in vertebrates).

Schmid &amp; Seipel (2005) argue that the origin of muscle cells is a monophyletic trait that occurred concurrently with the development of the digestive and nervous systems of all animals, and that this origin can be traced to a single metazoan ancestor in which muscle cells are present. They argue that molecular and morphological similarities between the muscles cells in Cnidaria and Ctenophora are similar enough to those of bilaterians that there would be one ancestor in metazoans from which muscle cells derive. In this case, Schmid &amp; Seipel argue that the last common ancestor of Bilateria, Ctenophora and Cnidaria, was a triploblast (an organism having three germ layers), and that diploblasty, meaning an organism with two germ layers, evolved secondarily, because of their observation of the lack of mesoderm or muscle found in most cnidarians and ctenophores. By comparing the morphology of cnidarians and ctenophores to bilaterians, Schmid &amp; Seipel were able to conclude that there were myoblast-like structures in the tentacles and gut of some species of cnidarians and the tentacles of ctenophores. Since this is a structure unique to muscle cells, these scientists determined based on the data collected by their peers that this is a marker for striated muscles similar to that observed in bilaterians. The authors also remark that the muscle cells found in cnidarians and ctenophores are often contested due to the origin of these muscle cells being the ectoderm rather than the mesoderm or mesendoderm.

The origin of true muscle cells is argued by other authors to be the endoderm portion of the mesoderm and the endoderm. However, Schmid &amp; Seipel (2005) counter skepticism – about whether the muscle cells found in ctenophores and cnidarians are &quot;true&quot; muscle cells – by considering that cnidarians develop through a medusa stage and polyp stage. They note that in the hydrozoans&#x27; medusa stage, there is a layer of cells that separate from the distal side of the ectoderm, which forms the striated muscle cells in a way similar to that of the mesoderm; they call this third separated layer of cells the &quot;ectocodon&quot;. Schmid &amp; Seipel argue that, even in bilaterians, not all muscle cells are derived from the mesendoderm: Their key examples are that in both the eye muscles of vertebrates and the muscles of spiralians, these cells derive from the ectodermal mesoderm, rather than the endodermal mesoderm. Furthermore, they argue that since myogenesis does occur in cnidarians with the help of the same molecular regulatory elements found in the specification of muscle cells in bilaterians, that there is evidence for a single origin for striated muscle.

In contrast to this argument for a single origin of muscle cells, Steinmetz, Kraus, &quot;et al&quot;. (2012) argue that molecular markers such as the myosin II protein used to determine this single origin of striated muscle predate the formation of muscle cells. They use an example of the contractile elements present in the Porifera, or sponges, that do truly lack this striated muscle containing this protein. Furthermore, Steinmetz, Kraus, &quot;et al&quot;. present evidence for a polyphyletic origin of striated muscle cell development through their analysis of morphological and molecular markers that are present in bilaterians and absent in cnidarians, ctenophores, and bilaterians. Steinmetz, Kraus, &quot;et al&quot;. showed that the traditional morphological and regulatory markers such as actin, the ability to couple myosin side chains phosphorylation to higher concentrations of the positive concentrations of calcium, and other MyHC elements are present in all metazoans not just the organisms that have been shown to have muscle cells. Thus, the usage of any of these structural or regulatory elements in determining whether or not the muscle cells of the cnidarians and ctenophores are similar enough to the muscle cells of the bilaterians to confirm a single lineage is questionable according to Steinmetz, Kraus, &quot;et al&quot;. Furthermore, they explain that the orthologues of the Myc genes that have been used to hypothesize the origin of striated muscle occurred through a gene duplication event that predates the first true muscle cells (meaning striated muscle), and they show that the Myc genes are present in the sponges that have contractile elements but no true muscle cells. Steinmetz, Kraus, &quot;et al&quot;. also showed that the localization of this duplicated set of genes that serve both the function of facilitating the formation of striated muscle genes, and cell regulation and movement genes, were already separated into striated much and non-muscle MHC. This separation of the duplicated set of genes is shown through the localization of the striated much to the contractile vacuole in sponges, while the non-muscle much was more diffusely expressed during developmental cell shape and change. Steinmetz, Kraus, &quot;et al&quot;. found a similar pattern of localization in cnidarians except with the cnidarian &quot;N. vectensis&quot; having this striated muscle marker present in the smooth muscle of the digestive tract. Thus, they argue that the pleisiomorphic trait of the separated orthologues of much cannot be used to determine the monophylogeny of muscle, and additionally argue that the presence of a striated muscle marker in the smooth muscle of this cnidarian shows a fundamental different mechanism of muscle cell development and structure in cnidarians.

Steinmetz, Kraus, &quot;et al&quot;. (2012) further argue for multiple origins of striated muscle in the metazoans by explaining that a key set of genes used to form the troponin complex for muscle regulation and formation in bilaterians is missing from the cnidarians and ctenophores, and 47 structural and regulatory proteins observed, Steinmetz, Kraus, &quot;et al&quot;. were not able to find even on unique striated muscle cell protein that was expressed in both cnidarians and bilaterians. Furthermore, the Z-disc seemed to have evolved differently even within bilaterians and there is a great deal of diversity of proteins developed even between this clade, showing a large degree of radiation for muscle cells. Through this divergence of the Z-disc, Steinmetz, Kraus, &quot;et al&quot;. argue that there are only four common protein components that were present in all bilaterians muscle ancestors and that of these for necessary Z-disc components only an actin protein that they have already argued is an uninformative marker through its pleisiomorphic state is present in cnidarians. Through further molecular marker testing, Steinmetz et al. observe that non-bilaterians lack many regulatory and structural components necessary for bilaterians muscle formation and do not find any unique set of proteins to both bilaterians and cnidarians and ctenophores that are not present in earlier, more primitive animals such as the sponges and amoebozoans. Through this analysis, the authors conclude that due to the lack of elements that bilaterian muscles are dependent on for structure and usage, nonbilaterian muscles must be of a different origin with a different set of regulatory and structural proteins.

In another take on the argument, Andrikou &amp; Arnone (2015) use the newly available data on gene regulatory networks to look at how the hierarchy of genes and morphogens and another mechanism of tissue specification diverge and are similar among early deuterostomes and protostomes. By understanding not only what genes are present in all bilaterians but also the time and place of deployment of these genes, Andrikou &amp; Arnone discuss a deeper understanding of the evolution of myogenesis.

In their paper, Andrikou &amp; Arnone (2015) argue that to truly understand the evolution of muscle cells the function of transcriptional regulators must be understood in the context of other external and internal interactions. Through their analysis, Andrikou &amp; Arnone found that there were conserved orthologues of the gene regulatory network in both invertebrate bilaterians and cnidarians. They argue that having this common, general regulatory circuit allowed for a high degree of divergence from a single well-functioning network. Andrikou &amp; Arnone found that the orthologues of genes found in vertebrates had been changed through different types of structural mutations in the invertebrate deuterostomes and protostomes, and they argue that these structural changes in the genes allowed for a large divergence of muscle function and muscle formation in these species. Andrikou &amp; Arnone were able to recognize not only any difference due to mutation in the genes found in vertebrates and invertebrates but also the integration of species-specific genes that could also cause divergence from the original gene regulatory network function. Thus, although a common muscle patterning system has been determined, they argue that this could be due to a more ancestral gene regulatory network being coopted several times across lineages with additional genes and mutations causing very divergent development of muscles. Thus it seems that the myogenic patterning framework may be an ancestral trait. However, Andrikou &amp; Arnone explain that the basic muscle patterning structure must also be considered in combination with the cis regulatory elements present at different times during development. In contrast with the high level of gene family apparatuses structure, Andrikou and Arnone found that the cis-regulatory elements were not well conserved both in time and place in the network which could show a large degree of divergence in the formation of muscle cells. Through this analysis, it seems that the myogenic GRN is an ancestral GRN with actual changes in myogenic function and structure possibly being linked to later coopts of genes at different times and places.

Evolutionarily, specialized forms of skeletal and cardiac muscles predated the divergence of the vertebrate / arthropod evolutionary line. This indicates that these types of muscle developed in a common ancestor sometime before 700 million years ago (mya). Vertebrate smooth muscle was found to have evolved independently from the skeletal and cardiac muscle types.

=== Invertebrate muscle cell types ===
The properties used for distinguishing fast, intermediate, and slow muscle fibers can be different for invertebrate flight and jump muscle. To further complicate this classification scheme, the mitochondrial content, and other morphological properties within a muscle fiber, can change in a tsetse fly with exercise and age.

<text>BBC West Midlands is the BBC English Region producing local radio and web content for the City of Birmingham, West Midlands, Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and parts of Gloucestershire. Although the region has been unofficially called BBC West Midlands since BBC East Midlands became a separate region in 1991, it retains the BBC Midlands name and brand, with its history dating from 1927, for public use. It was known as the Midland Region from 1927 until c. 1974.

==Services==
===Television===
The BBC Midlands region carries a number of regional programmes today. The regular schedule consists of the flagship &quot;Midlands Today&quot; news programme, regional news bulletins, the weekly regional magazine programme &quot;Inside Out&quot; and a twenty-minute opt-out during &quot;Sunday Politics&quot;.

===Radio===
The region is the controlling centre for BBC WM, BBC Coventry and Warwickshire, BBC Hereford and Worcester, BBC Radio Stoke and BBC Radio Shropshire.
Some of this programming is simulcast with the radio stations in the BBC East Midlands region, and overnight BBC Radio 5 Live is simulcast.

===Online and Interactive===
BBC West Midlands also produces regional news and local radio pages for Ceefax (retired after the digital switchover in 2012), BBC Red Button and &quot;BBC Local News&quot; websites for each county.

==History==
===Early years===
BBC Midlands is the oldest of the BBC English Regions, having been formed (as the Midland Region) in 1927, when the new Borough Hill high-powered radio transmitter at Daventry became the first to replace the earlier lower-powered city-based radio stations, such as Birmingham&#x27;s 5IT, and make regional and national broadcasting a technical possibility.

The Daventry transmitter broadcast two channels, and as further regional transmission stations followed (starting with London&#x27;s Brookmans Park in 1929), this quickly established the pattern for pre-war broadcasting. 5XX from Daventry (later – from 7 October 1934 – from Droitwich) carried the BBC National Programme originating in London, while 5GB broadcast the BBC Regional Programme, the regional controller of which was free to schedule, as he saw fit, a mix of networked programming from London, regional programmes produced by the Birmingham base, and items taken from the output of other regions.

The first director of the new Midland regional service was Percy Edgar, who had been the announcer and Head of Programming for 5IT on its opening night in 1922 and was to be the dominant figure in Midlands broadcasting from its birth until 1945. Edgar was a strong believer in the value of local production and fought to establish the Midland Region as an independent source of programming, pioneering community-focussed initiatives such as the &quot;Midland Parliament&quot; programme, where members of the public debated controversial issues on air with major public figures.

By 1935, the BBC&#x27;s Midland Region covered an area extending from The Potteries to Norfolk and was producing 40% of its broadcast output itself - a greater proportion even than that of BBC Scotland. With 14 producers, it was the largest BBC department outside London.

===The television era===
Regional radio was suspended during World War II, but in July 1945, the BBC Home Service was launched on a similar regional basis to the pre-war Regional Programme. The Midlands Region continued under new director Dennis Morris in the independent and innovative vein established by Edgar – pioneering on-air listener feedback with &quot;Listeners Answer Back&quot; in 1946 and launching the longest-running and most popular programme in the history of radio – &quot;The Archers&quot; – at the beginning of 1951.

Despite these successes, two technological developments gradually started to make the old regional system untenable. The development of FM radio made it possible to fit a far greater number of channels into the spectrum without conflict and interference, which opened the possibility of more towns and cities having their own radio stations. The Midlands Region opened the BBC&#x27;s first local radio station, BBC Radio Leicester, in 1967, and with many more of these planned, the relevance of the regional radio station broadcasting from the Welsh border to the North Sea was immediately cast into doubt.

Television was also presenting more of a threat than an opportunity. Although the Midlands had been the first area outside London to receive television coverage with the opening of the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station in 1949, the greater cost of television production compared to radio meant that it was always going to be a more centralised service.

A television studio was opened in Birmingham in 1950 and early successes included &quot;Come Dancing&quot; in 1949 – the first regionally produced television programme to establish itself as a regular in the national network schedule - and &quot;Midlands Today&quot; in 1964, one of the UK&#x27;s first daily regional news programmes. Regional television had been established in 1957 with the launch of local evening news bulletins. Although it fared better than the struggling BBC North or BBC West (which was threatened for a while with being absorbed by the Midlands Region), it was clear that if BBC Midlands was too large to be truly local in the radio market, it was equally too small to be as self-sufficient across the full range of television programming as it had been in radio.

===Division of the Region===
The result was the radical shakeup that took place following the publication of the &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot; report in 1969. The eastern part of the region was reborn as the Norwich-based BBC East, with both it and the smaller remaining BBC Midlands focussing entirely on regional television (primarily regional news) and local radio. Regional radio ceased almost entirely (save for regional opt-outs on Radio 4 until 1980), and all television and radio production for national networks was transferred to the separate BBC Birmingham network production centre.

The cost of television production technology decreased throughout the 1980s and 1990s and this had several effects on the BBC in the Midlands. Smaller, more local channels became viable. The BBC&#x27;s Midlands coverage had long been accused of being excessively Birmingham-centric, and in 1991, television broadcasting from the Waltham transmitting station and the BBC Radio Leicester, BBC Radio Nottingham and BBC Radio Derby radio stations were given over to a new Nottingham-based BBC East Midlands.

A more radical move in this direction took place in 2006 when the West Midlands Region piloted the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Local TV&quot; initiative, with television news programmes produced for six local areas, all much smaller than the traditional TV regions, and in the case of Birmingham and the Black Country, even smaller than those covered by local radio stations. This programming was broadcast on digital television and over the internet only. The experiment came to an end as planned in September 2006 and has not been repeated since.

On the 15 January 2021, BBC Radio launched a new temporary station called BBC Radio Wolverhampton.

==Studios==
The first studios used by BBC Midlands were offices and a small studio in Broad Street, Birmingham; however, these became too small for the expanding region. Regional News remained at Broad Street until 1971, the small studio being ideal for news bulletins, while other productions took place in a former cinema in Gosta Green and a regency mansion in Carpenter Road, Edgbaston.

In 1971, all of these operations were condensed into a new integrated studio complex, Pebble Mill Studios. Pebble Mill became iconic because it featured in some of the most popular programming of the 1970s. Pebble Mill had two studios, Studio A for major productions and Studio B, for &quot;Midlands Today&quot; and other local programming. When the complex was built, it was intended that there should be a Studio C for drama production; however, this never happened, and instead the foyer of the building was used as an extra studio, complete with the gallery and facilities built in for Studio C. A conservatory studio was also built that held &quot;Good Morning with Anne and Nick&quot; for many years. The new studios encompassed network and regional productions and radio, and was the Headquarters for BBC English Regions.

By the 1990s, change meant Pebble Mill&#x27;s future was uncertain. Advances in technology made outside broadcasts cheaper and much more common, while also increasing the scope for independent and outsourced television production. In combination, these meant that much television programming could increasingly be produced without the need for the sort of large integrated studio complexes represented by Pebble Mill. In addition, the building was getting costly to heat and maintain. In 2000, Studio A was closed, following the need to make savings at the corporation, and plans were made to dispose of Pebble Mill.

In 2004, productions split two ways. BBC West Midlands, &quot;Midlands Today&quot;, BBC WM, BBC English Regions and the network production base BBC Birmingham moved to The Mailbox in Birmingham city centre, with many of the productions moving to the BBC Drama Village. The Mailbox contains the studios, a newsroom and radio facilities, all of which have windows allowing the public to view how their television and radio is made.

It was announced in August 2022, that BBC Birmingham will leave The Mailbox for the new creative quarter in Digbeth, Birmingham from 2026. The new broadcast centre will occupy the former Typhoo Tea factory. By then, in adjacent studios, the BBC’s flagship show &quot;Masterchef&quot; would have already taken up residence. The move coincides with BBC’s lease at The Mailbox coming to an end, having been located there since the move from Pebble Mill in 2004.

In addition to the main headquarters, BBC West Midlands has local radio stations and news bureaux located in Coventry, Gloucester, Shrewsbury, Stoke-on-Trent, and Worcester.

<doc id="571553" wikidata="Q978134" url="?curid=571553" title="Roland TR-909">
<text>The Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, commonly known as the 909, is a drum machine introduced by Roland Corporation in 1983, succeeding the TR-808. It was the first Roland drum machine to use samples for some sounds, and the first with MIDI functionality, allowing it to synchronize with other devices. Though the 909 was a commercial failure, it influenced the development of electronic dance music genres such as techno, house and acid house.

== Development ==
The TR-909 was designed by Tadao Kikumoto, who had also led development on Roland&#x27;s previous drum machine, the TR-808, and designed the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. Makoto Muroi was also a chief engineer, the software was developed by Atsushi Hoshiai, and the voice circuits were developed by Yoshiro Oue.

The 909 was the first Roland drum machine to use samples, for its crash, ride and hi-hat sounds. Hoshiai sampled his own drum kit for the cymbals, using a mismatched pair of Paiste and Zildjian hi-hat cymbals. He sampled them in 6-bit and edited the waveform on a computer with a CP/M-80 operating system. Other sounds are generated with analog synthesis. According to a Roland representative, the engineers felt that samples had some disadvantages and so opted for a combination of sampled and analog sounds.
== Sounds and features ==

Whereas the 808 is known for its &quot;boomy&quot; bass, the 909 sounds aggressive and &quot;punchy&quot;. It has 11 percussion voices and offers sounds for bass drum, snare, toms, rimshot, clap, crash cymbal, ride cymbal and hi-hat (open and closed). It omits the clave, cowbell, maracas, and conga sounds from the 808. The bass has controls for attack and decay. The snare has controls for tone and &quot;snappy&quot;, which adjusts the amount of the snare wire sound. As the clap and snare are generated via the same noise source, they produce a phasing effect when played together.

The 909 features a sequencer that can chain up to 96 patterns into songs of up to 896 measures, and offers controls including shuffle and flam. Users can add accents to beats. The 909 was the first Roland drum machine to use MIDI, allowing it to synchronize with other MIDI devices, or to allow sounds to be triggered by an external MIDI controller for wider dynamic range. Older Roland machines can be synchronized via its DIN sync port.

== Release ==
The 909 was released in 1983 and retailed for $1,195 USD, . It attracted interest in the industry as the first Roland instrument to use sampled sounds.

In its review, &quot;Electronics &amp; Music Maker&quot; found the 909 easier to use than the 808 and felt it offered the best analog drum sounds on the market. It concluded that it offered a good combination of analog and sampled sounds and that the addition of MIDI brought the 909 &quot;as up to date as it needs to be&quot;. &quot;One Two Testing&quot; found the 909 &quot;gloriously easy to use&quot;, but felt it was overpriced and &quot;still sounds like a drum &quot;machine&quot;, instead of a machine playing drums ... It lacks the authenticity of real sounds for studio work.&quot;

The 909 was a commercial failure, as users preferred the more realistic sampled sounds of competing products such as the LinnDrum. Roland ceased production after one year, having built 10,000 units. Roland changed elements of the 909 in later revisions, correcting problems and adjusting sounds. Some users modify their machines to match sounds from earlier revisions.

== Legacy ==
Whereas the TR-808 was important in the development of hip hop, the TR-909, alongside the TB-303 synthesizer, influenced dance music such as techno, house and acid. According to Gordon Reid of &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, &quot;Like the TR-808 before it, nobody could have predicted the reverence in which the TR-909 would eventually come to be held.&quot;

In 1984, the 909 was used in records including the city pop album &quot;Sailing Blaster&quot; by Hiroshi Sato, the electronic album &quot;S-F-X&quot; by Haruomi Hosono, and the EP &quot;Remission&quot; by the industrial band Skinny Puppy. Another early 909 user was Kurtis Mantronik, who used it on records by his hip-hop group Mantronix and records he produced such as &quot;Back to the Old School&quot; (1986) by Just-Ice. 

In the late 1980s, the 909 was popularized by Chicago house and Detroit techno producers such as Derrick May, Frankie Knuckles and Jeff Mills, who bought second-hand units. DJ Sneak said that &quot;every Chicago producer was using the 909&quot;. &quot;Mixmag&quot; described Mills as the &quot;master&quot; of the 909. Mills said its design made it possible to &quot;play&quot; the 909 rather than just program it, using the tuning controls to imitate the feel of a live drummer.

The 909 was used on hip-hop records by acts including Boogie Down Productions, Ultramagnetic MCs, Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince and Public Enemy. In the early 1990s, the Japanese composer Yuzo Koshiro incorporated samples of the 909 in his soundtracks for the &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; games. That decade, the 909 was adopted by pop musicians such as Madonna and Pet Shop Boys, and by rock and alternative musicians. Mark Bell used it to create &quot;militaristic&quot; percussion for Björk&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;Hunter&quot;, and Radiohead used it on &quot;Videotape&quot;, from their 2007 album &quot;In Rainbows&quot;. Electronic artists such as Kirk Degiorgio and Cristian Vogel created sample libraries by recording their friends&#x27; machines. 

The 909 was succeeded in 1984 by the TR-707, which uses samples for all its sounds. In 2017, Roland released the TR-09, a smaller version of the 909 with additional features.

<doc id="571560" wikidata="Q336046" url="?curid=571560" title="Robert Badinter">
<text>Robert Badinter (; 30 March 1928 – 9 February 2024) was a French lawyer, politician, and author who enacted the abolition of the death penalty in France in 1981, while serving as Minister of Justice under François Mitterrand. He also served in high-level appointed positions with national and international bodies working for justice and the rule of law.

== Early life ==
Robert Badinter was born on 30 March 1928, in Paris to Simon Badinter and Charlotte Rosenberg. His Bessarabian Jewish family had immigrated to France in 1921 to escape pogroms. During World War II, after the Nazi occupation of Paris, his family sought refuge in Lyon. His father was captured in the 1943 Rue Sainte-Catherine Roundup and deported with other Jews to the Sobibor extermination camp, where he was murdered shortly thereafter.

Badinter graduated in law from Paris Law Faculty of the University of Paris. He then went to the United States to continue his studies at Columbia University in New York City, where he got his MA. He continued his studies again at the Sorbonne until 1954. In 1965, Badinter was appointed a professor at University of Sorbonne. He continued as an Emeritus professor until 1996.

==Political career==

===Beginnings===
Badinter started his career in Paris in 1951, as a lawyer working with Henri Torrès.
In 1965, along with Jean-Denis Bredin, he founded the law firm Badinter, Bredin et partenaires, (now Bredin Prat) where he practiced law until 1981.

===The Bontems case===
Badinter&#x27;s activism against the death penalty began after Roger Bontems&#x27;s execution on 28 November 1972. Along with Claude Buffet, Bontems had taken a prison guard and a nurse hostage during the 1971 revolt in Clairvaux Prison. While the police were storming the building, Buffet slit the hostages&#x27; throats. The jury sentenced both men to death. Badinter served as defense counsel for Bontems and was outraged by the sentence. After witnessing the executions, Badinter dedicated himself to the abolition of the death penalty.

===Death penalty===
In this context, he agreed to defend Patrick Henry. In January 1976, eight-year-old Philippe Bertrand was kidnapped. Henry was soon picked up as a suspect, but released because of a lack of evidence. He gave interviews on television, saying that those who kidnapped and killed children deserved death. A few days later, he was arrested again and shown Bertrand&#x27;s corpse hidden in a blanket under his bed. Badinter and Robert Bocquillon defended Henry, making the case not about Henry&#x27;s guilt, but against applying the death penalty. Henry was sentenced to life imprisonment and died months after a compassionate release from prison in 2017 (after receiving parole in 2001, revoked in 2002). The lenient verdict came as a shock, with several publications having already called the outcome as a virtual certainty for execution; according to speculative sources, the critical vote on the death sentence failing by a seven-to-five vote majority. The case of Jerome Carrein, condemned 15 days after Henry&#x27;s sentence for the murder of a child, was widely dubbed the &quot;revenge of the guillotine&quot;. Until the execution of Gary Gilmore in Utah on 17 January, three days before Henry&#x27;s verdict, France was the only Western liberal democracy actively performing executions. 

Despite president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s modernist outlook and stated opposition to the guillotine, a further three executions took place during this period, of Christian Ranucci in July 1976, Carrein in June 1977, and Hamida Djandoubi in September 1977. Badinter took no part in arguing either case. However, 63% of French voters supported keeping the death penalty at the time it was abolished. In 1980-81, Badinter defended Philippe Maurice, whose sentence of death was confirmed by the superior court in March 1981, weeks before the election of abolitionist François Mitterrand to President. A further eight sentences of death were issued before the bill of abolition was passed by the French parliament in September (the last only two days before the Senate voted) but none reached stage of execution and were converted by the abolition act. Maurice&#x27;s sentence, after lobbying from Badinter, was commuted by Mitterrand on May 25, among Mitterrand&#x27;s first acts as president.

===Ministerial mandate (1981–1986)===
In 1981, François Mitterrand, a self-professed opponent of the death penalty, was elected president and Badinter was appointed as Minister of Justice. Among his first actions was to introduce a bill to Parliament proposing the abolition of the death penalty for all crimes, both civilian and military. The bill was passed by the Senate after heated debate on 30 September 1981. On 9 October the law was officially enacted, ending capital punishment in France.

During his mandate, he also helped abolish &quot;&quot;juridictions d&#x27;exception&quot; (&quot;special courts&quot;), such as the Cour de Sûreté de l&#x27;État (&quot;&quot;) and the military courts, and improved the rights of victims of crime.

He remained a minister until February 1986.

===1986–2024===

From March 1986 to March 1995, he was president of the French Constitutional Council. From 1995 to 2011, he served as a senator, representing the Hauts-de-Seine département.

In 1989, he participated in an edition of the Antenne 2 talk show &quot;Apostrophes&quot; devoted to human rights, together with the 14th Dalai Lama. Discussing the disappearance of Tibetan culture from Tibet, Badinter used the term &quot;cultural genocide&quot;. He praised the example of Tibetan nonviolent resistance. Badinter met with the Dalai Lama many times, in particular in 1998 when he greeted him as the &quot;Champion of Human Rights&quot;, and again in 2008.

In 1991, Badinter was appointed by the Council of Ministers of the European Community as a member of the Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia. He was elected as president of the commission by the four other members, all presidents of constitutional courts in the European Community. The Arbitration Commission has rendered eleven pieces of advice regarding &quot;major legal questions&quot; arising from the split of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Badinter was the first president of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) following its creation in 1995; he served in that position until 2013.

Badinter opposed the accession of Turkey to the European Union, on the grounds that Turkey might not be able to follow the rules of the Union. He was also concerned about the nation&#x27;s location, saying: &quot;We&#x27;ll have, we Europeans, common borders with Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Iraq and Syria. I am asking you: What justifies our common borders with these countries? What justifies that we&#x27;d get involved in the most dangerous areas of the world?&quot;

As a head of the Arbitration Commission, he gained high respect among Macedonians and other ethnic groups in the Republic of Macedonia because he recommended &quot;that the use of the name &#x27;Macedonia&#x27; cannot therefore imply any territorial claim against another State&quot;. He supported full recognition of the Republic in 1992. He was involved in drafting the so-called Ohrid Agreement in the Republic of Macedonia. This agreement was based on the principle that ethnic-related proposals passed by the national assembly (and later to be applied to actions of city councils and other local government bodies) should be supported by a double majority of both Macedonian and Albanian ethnic groups. This is often called the &quot;Badinter principle&quot;.

In 2009, Badinter expressed dismay at the Pope&#x27;s lifting of the excommunication of controversial English Catholic bishop Richard Williamson, who had expressed Holocaust denial and was illegally consecrated a bishop. The Pope reactivated the excommunication later.

Badinter was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2009.

===World Justice Project===
Badinter served as an Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project. It works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the rule of law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.

===Case of Dominique Strauss-Kahn===
At the start of the case of Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011, in which the IMF Managing Director was accused of rape and was arrested by the police in New York City, Robert Badinter reacted by saying to France Inter that he was outraged by the &quot;media killing&quot; and denounced the &quot;failure of an entire system&quot; inherent in the perp walk of Strauss-Kahn, a suspect, but also of the media judging an assumed culprit&#x27;s guilt for charges that had not initiated a trial, and which were eventually dismissed. Strauss-Kahn had been a favoured Socialist candidate for the presidential election the following April, but dropped all pretences of running after his arrest.

==Personal life and death==
Badinter married philosopher and feminist writer Élisabeth Bleustein-Blanchet, daughter of Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, who was the founder of Publicis, a multinational advertising and public relations company. He died in Paris during the night of 8 to 9 February 2024, at the age of 95. President Macron later announced Badinter would be honored with burial in the Panthéon.

==Awards==
Badinter refused any honorary distinction from the National Order of the Legion of Honor (as did his wife) and the Ordre National du Mérite. He nevertheless received foreign decorations, notably the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk (Czech Republic) in 2001. and the Order 8-September (North Macedonia) in 2006. As a longstanding activist for the abolition of the death penalty, Robert Badinter was appointed an honorary member of the International Commission Against the Death Penalty. He was awarded the International Abolition Award by Death Penalty Focus in 2023.

<doc id="571565" wikidata="Q5354688" url="?curid=571565" title="Elections in Gibraltar">
<text>Gibraltar elects on the national level a legislature. The Gibraltar Parliament has 17 members, all elected for a four-year term in one constituency with each voter getting to vote for their selection of ten candidates. Gibraltar forms a single constituency but voters have only ten votes. Hence the electoral bloc with the most votes will normally get ten seats and the runners up seven.

==Eligibility to vote==

People must be qualified to vote and listed on the Register of Electors in order to cast a ballot.

British nationals (this includes all forms of British nationality) who have lived in Gibraltar for a continuous period of six months and who intend to live in Gibraltar either permanently or indefinitely are entitled to register to vote in general elections to the Gibraltar Parliament if they will be aged 18 or over on polling day.

Gibraltar, along with the UK, joined the EEC (the predecessor of the European Union) in 1973, and from 2004 eligible voters in Gibraltar were able to vote in elections to the European Parliament. British, European Union and qualifying Commonwealth citizens (those who had a permit or certificate to enter/remain in Gibraltar, or who did not require such a permit/certificate on the date of their electoral registration application) living in Gibraltar were entitled to register to vote in European Parliament elections if they were aged 18 or over on polling day. 

In addition, British nationals and Commonwealth citizens living outside Gibraltar could register as &#x27;overseas electors&#x27; and vote in elections to the European Parliament provided that they were on the Register of Electors in Gibraltar within the past 15 years (the 15 years period begins when they no longer appeared in the Register of Electors, not the date they moved abroad). For British nationals and Commonwealth citizens who moved abroad before they were 18 years old, they could still qualify for registration as an &#x27;overseas elector&#x27; in elections to the European Parliament, with the 15 years period calculated from the date their parent(s)/guardian ceased to appear in the Register of Electors in Gibraltar.

Following Gibraltar&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union as a result of Brexit, this was revoked on 31 December 2020.

==Latest elections==
==General elections to the Gibraltar Parliament (House of Assembly)==
Below is a series of results from elections to the Gibraltar Parliament and its predecessor, the House of Assembly (which was created upon the publication of the Gibraltar Constitution 1969).

Each voter has ten votes (eight before 2007) meaning that parties usually stand ten candidates, and the winning party is that which manages to get all their candidates elected.

<text>Safran Helicopter Engines, previously known as Turbomeca, is a French manufacturer of low- and medium-power gas turbine turboshaft engines for helicopters. The company also produces gas turbine engines for aircraft and missiles, as well as turbines for land, industrial and marine applications.

Since its founding as &quot;Turbomeca&quot; during 1938, Safran Helicopter Engines has produced over 72,000 turbines. In its early years, it benefitted greatly from a rearmament programme conducted by the French state; operations were disrupted by the occupation of France during the Second World War, but the company survived and rebuilt quickly during the immediate postwar years. Prominent successes during the Cold War include the use of its Artouste II turboshaft engine to power the new Sud Aviation Alouette II helicopter (the first production turbine-powered helicopter in the world) as well as its involvement in Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Limited (a joint venture with British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Ltd that produced turbojet and turboshaft engines).

During September 2001, the French aerospace specialist SNECMA Group acquired the company, after which it was rebranded as Safran Helicopter Engines. The company states that it has more than 2,500 customers in 155 countries. Safran Helicopter Engines has 15 sites and operates on each continent, providing its customers with a proximity service through 44 distributors and certified maintenance centers, 18 Repair &amp; Overhaul Centers, and 90 Field Representatives and Field Technicians. Safran Helicopter Engines subsidiary &quot;Safran Power Units&quot; is the leading European manufacturer of turbojet engines for missiles, drones and auxiliary power units. Safran Helicopter Engines has 6,300 employees worldwide, with 5000 based in France. In 2015, the company reportedly produced and delivered 718 new engines, and repaired around 1,700 engines.

== History ==

On 29 August 1938, the company was founded as &quot;Turbomeca&quot; by the aero engine designers Joseph Szydlowski and André Planiol, following the granting of their patent application for a supercharger during the previous year. Engine manufacturer Hispano-Suiza promptly ordered a demonstrator to equip its 12 Y engine, which was used on the MS 405 C1 fighter, amongst others. The company benefitted greatly from a decision by the French Government, recognising the looming threat of another World War with neighbouring Nazi Germany, having launched a rearmament programme during 1937.

Over the course of three years, Turbomeca expanded rapidly from an artisanal production to an industrial one to meet the extensive demands of the French aircraft industry. The production figures of the company&#x27;s first few years of operation indicate this rapid expansion: 18 compressors were produced in 1938, 300 in 1939 and 1,200 in 1940. The factory at Mézières-sur-Seine had only just attained fully operational status in June 1940, when the French Government advised a relocation to the south of France to avoid the German advance. That same month, Turbomeca repositioned its operations to a newly requisitioned workshop in Saint-Pé-de-Bigorre near the Hispano-Suiza engine factory in Tarbes. However, these buildings were quickly found to be too small for its needs, thus, in 1941, a site was acquired in Bordes near Pau. Turbomeca progressively transferred to this site between the autumn of 1941 and June 1942. In November 1942, Szydlowski fled to neutral Switzerland. Between October 1942 and 1944, production stalled while its workforce dropped from about 300 to about 50 personnel.

Following the liberation of the region by Allied forces in August 1944, Szydlowski returned to Bordes to help revive Turbomeca; much of the firm&#x27;s former staff were re-employed and much of its machinery was recovered as well, enabling a speedy revival during the postwar era. During the late 1940s, Szydlowski opted to focus Turbomeca&#x27;s design resources on low-power jet propulsion, intended for a new range of jet-powered aircraft, including turbine-powered helicopters. The production of turboshaft engines, which became widely used for rotorcraft, became a staple of the business over subsequent decades.

From 1950, Turbomeca produced the tiny centrifugal flow Palas turbojet, producing 1.6 kN (353 lbf). In addition to the company&#x27;s own production, the Palas was also produced under license by Blackburn and General Aircraft in the United Kingdom and Continental in the United States. Blackburn had a licence for producing other Turbomeca designs. During 1955, Turbomeca&#x27;s Artouste II turboshaft engine was adopted for the new Sud Aviation Alouette II helicopter, which became the world&#x27;s first production turbine-powered helicopter one year later. Starting in 1957, the firm stated manufacture of the Bastan turboprop for the Aérospatiale N 262 airliner.

During 1968, a joint venture with British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Ltd, named Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Limited, was established to develop and produce the Adour turbojet engine to power the Anglo-French SEPECAT Jaguar. In addition to manufacturing the aero-engine, the company also provided associated support services to end users. The Adour would not only be adopted for the Jaguar, but also various other aircraft, such as the BAE Systems Hawk, the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, and Mitsubishi T-2 trainer aircraft, as well as the Mitsubishi F-1 ground attack fighter. In excess of 2,800 Adour engines would eventually be produced, reportedly amassing a cumulative total of 7,000,000 flying hours.

Deciding to build on its success with another engine, Rolls-Royce Turbomeca handled development and production of the RTM322 turboshaft engine. During 1995, it was announced that the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 turboshaft engine had been selected to power the British Army&#x27;s fleet of AgustaWestland Apache attack helicopters. Over the following decades, the RTM322 engine was adopted by various operators to power a number of rotorcraft, including the NHIndustries NH90 and AgustaWestland AW101 medium-sized transport helicopters, along with the Eurocopter X³, a high speed technology demonstrator. During 2003, it was announced that the joint venture was undertaking the development of an enhanced version of the RTM322, taking the powerplant from the current 2,400shp (1,800 kW) power range to beyond 2,500shp in the near term and potentially 3,300shp in the longer term after further improvements are finalised. Keith Reid, Rolls-Royce Turbomeca international marketing manager, noted that the RM322 had been originally designed with future growth in mind, and that operators had been placing an increasing emphasis upon hot and high flight capabilities, which necessitated more engine power is being available.

During June 1989, another joint venture, MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce (MTR) was established as a part of the framework created on behalf of the French and West German governments to develop an advanced multirole battlefield helicopter, the Eurocopter Tiger. Being responsible for developing and producing the Tiger&#x27;s MTR390 powerplant, MTR was designated as the programme management company responsible for the engine, and was jointly staffed by the partner companies, Turbomeca, Germany&#x27;s MTU Aero Engines and Britain&#x27;s Rolls-Royce. During early 2000, an initial production contract was signed by the German Federal Office of Defence Technology and Procurement (BWB) and MTR; valued at DM430 million and comprising 320 engines plus spares, the contract represented the MTU390&#x27;s clearance for production. Later-built models of the Tiger are furnished with more powerful models of the MTU390 engine than had been installed upon the initial examples.

During 2013, an agreement between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca to buy out the former&#x27;s involvement in Rolls-Royce Turbomeca in exchange for around €293 million ($381 million), after which responsibility for undertaking all activities related to the RTM322 engine, including manufacturing and maintenance/services, was transferred to Turbomeca. Accordingly, Rolls-Royce Turbomeca is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Safran Helicopter Engines.

By 2010, Safran Helicopter Engines turbines powered civil, parapublic and defence helicopters for all the leading helicopter manufacturers (mainly Eurocopter, but also AgustaWestland, Sikorsky, Kamov, HAL, NHI).

==Engine models==

Safran is the world&#x27;s leading manufacturer of gas turbine engines for both civil and military helicopters. They design, produce, sell and support a complete range of turbine engines for this market. More than 18,000 Safran Helicopter engines already power helicopters built by the world&#x27;s leading manufacturers: Airbus Helicopters, AVIC, Sikorsky, Bell Helicopter, Finmeccanica Helicopters (formerly AgustaWestland), Denel, Russian Helicopters, HAL, Boeing, etc. In the military sector, Safran powers the Tiger, NH90, Finmeccanica Helicopters A109 Power, AW101 and many others. Helicopters powered by Safran are deployed by 2,500 customers in 150 countries.

===Turboprops/turboshafts===
&quot;Most Turbomeca engines bear the names of Pyrenean mountains.&quot;

Safran offers several main engine families: Arrius and Arriel (up to 1,000 shaft horsepower), for light and medium helicopters; TM333, Arrano and Ardiden (rated at 1,000 to 2,000 SHP), for civil and military machines in the 5 to 8 ton class; Makila and RTM322 (over 2,000 SHP), for heavy rotorcraft.

<text>Barrhead (, ) is a town in East Renfrewshire, Scotland, southwest of Glasgow city centre on the edge of the Gleniffer Braes. At the 2011 census its population was 17,268.

== History ==

Barrhead was formed when a series of small textile-producing villages (Barrhead, Arthurlie, Grahamston and Gateside) gradually grew into one another to form one continuous town. According to local historian James McWhirter, the name &quot;Barrhead&quot; first appeared in 1750. Glanderston House, to the south, at one time belonged to the Stewart kings of Scotland.

In 1851 there was an explosion at the Victoria Pit colliery in nearby Nitshill, killing 63 men and boys who worked in the mine, many of whom lived in Barrhead. The victims were buried in a mass grave in the yard at St John&#x27;s Church on Darnley Road, and although some bodies were later exhumed and reburied in other cemeteries, some may still reside at St John&#x27;s in an unmarked grave.

In 1890, with a rapidly expanding population approaching 10,000, various local residents formed a Barrhead Burgh Formation Committee. The status of police burgh was granted in 1894 and William Shanks, proprietor of a local company, was elected as the first provost of Barrhead.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the town was a major centre for manufacturing, with industries including an iron foundry, a tannery, and the Armitage Shanks porcelainware works, as well as Gaskell&#x27;s carpet factory, employing generations of the town&#x27;s residents. In the later 20th century, the decline and closure of nearly all of these industries caused a fall in local employment and population. In recent years, Barrhead has found new life as a popular residential commuter town for nearby Paisley and Glasgow.

During World War II, several bombs fell on Barrhead from German planes headed towards Clydebank and Yoker.

== Governance ==

In 1894 Barrhead became a burgh of barony, meaning that it had its own town council. The council was based at Barrhead Burgh Hall. The burgh status was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 when Strathclyde Regional Council and Renfrew District Council were formed. Subsequent reorganisation to a single tier local authority in 1996 placed Barrhead under the auspices of East Renfrewshire Council. Barrhead is a single council ward, electing 4 members to serve as part of East Renfrewshire Council.

Barrhead is part of the county constituency of East Renfrewshire, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Blair McDougall of Scottish Labour was elected to represent East Renfrewshire in the 2024 UK General Election.

In the Scottish Parliament, Barrhead forms part of the Renfrewshire South constituency, represented by Tom Arthur of the SNP. Barrhead is also represented by seven regional MSPs from the West of Scotland electoral region.

==Geography==
Barrhead forms part of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Areas within the town include Arthurlie, Auchenback, Gateside and Grahamston.

The town is about from the edge of the Glasgow urban area (Hurlet and Parkhouse neighbourhoods), separated by farmland and countryside, much of which is now part of the Dams to Darnley Country Park, encompassing the Balgray and Waulkmill Glen Reservoirs and the course of the Brock Burn.

==Economy==
Major businesses within the town include Barrhead Travel, Kelburn Brewing Company, and JM Murdoch &amp; Son, among others. The town&#x27;s largest employer is East Renfrewshire Council and the public sector. In 2002, part of the administration of East Renfrewshire Council relocated from Eastwood Park to Barrhead Main Street.

East Renfrewshire Council committed nearly £100 million to a masterplan to redevelop and modernise Barrhead&#x27;s economy between 2007 and 2017. The Glasgow Road corridor is being redeveloped into a dedicated business district which includes Crossmill Business Park, Blackbyres Court, and the former Bowerwalls housing area.

There are four industrial estates: Robertson Street Industrial Estate, Levern Industrial Estate at Cogan Street, Muriel Street, and the Barrhead Cargo Centre and Shanks Industrial Park, located on the former site of the Armitage Shanks factory.

In 2005 local businesses created the Barrhead Business Forum, which liaises with East Renfrewshire Council, Barrhead Community Council, and East Renfrewshire Chamber of Commerce.

The administration and collection of business rates for Barrhead is undertaken by Renfrewshire Council.

In October 2016, Barrhead businesses voted in favour of becoming a Business Improvement District (BID), which is a model proving successful for town centres across the UK and beyond. The Barrhead BID is called &#x27;All About Barrhead&#x27; and is the third BID in East Renfrewshire, following Giffnock which established in 2013 and Clarkston which is now in its second term, establishing in 2010.

The town is part of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board. The nearest accident and emergency unit is located at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.

==Transport==
Barrhead is accessible via Junction 2 (Pollok) or Junction 3 (Darnley) of the M77 motorway.

Local bus services, McGill&#x27;s Bus Services, travel from Barrhead to Glasgow, Paisley, Neilston, and Newton Mearns.

Barrhead railway station, which serves the town, is on the Glasgow South Western Line. Trains from Barrhead run north-east to Glasgow Central and south to Kilmarnock, Stranraer, and Carlisle.

At the beginning of the 20th century, several railway lines ran through Barrhead to accommodate the town&#x27;s manufacturing industries: the Glasgow Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway and the Glasgow and Kilmarnock Joint Railway, which merged to become the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway; the Glasgow &amp; South Western Railway, which built Barrhead Central railway station as the terminus of its short-lived Barrhead branch; and the Caledonian Railway. Evidence of these lines can still be seen within the town, including two standalone sections of railway viaduct, one near the Tesco store and the other now carrying a footpath between Springhill Road and the Woodside Park in Upper Auchenback (known locally as the Jerries).

Barrhead was formerly served by routes 14 and 28 of the once extensive Glasgow Corporation Tramways system. Trams ran from Barrhead to Glasgow and Paisley. Glasgow tram service 14 was once the longest in Great Britain, running from Milngavie on the far north-western edge of Greater Glasgow, through the city centre and then through Thornliebank, Spiersbridge, Barrhead and Paisley to reach Renfrew Ferry on the south side of the Clyde. Tramway services in Paisley and Barrhead were withdrawn in 1957; the entire system was dismantled by September 1962.

=== Future ===
A new railway station, Balgray railway station, to the south of Barrhead, is planned. Construction has not yet started.

==Education==
Barrhead has five primary schools: Carlibar Primary School, Cross Arthurlie Primary School, Hillview School, St. John&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School and St. Mark&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School. In 2007, St. Mark&#x27;s received an outstanding report from HM Inspectorate of Education with 11 &quot;excellents&quot; – the most ever recorded by HMIE – making St. Mark&#x27;s officially the best school in Scotland.

The new Carlibar Primary School, opened in the autumn of 2006 to replace an outdated building, hosts a family centre, a pre-school assessment unit, community and adult learning services, and a state-of-the-art language and communication unit which serves nearly 50 children with autism from across East Renfrewshire.

The town has two secondary schools: St. Luke&#x27;s High School and Barrhead High, both in the Auchenback area. In 2018, a £30 million replacement building for Barrhead High was opened. St. Luke&#x27;s High School was named a School of Ambition by the Scottish Executive.

==Culture==

The Royal Shakespeare Company has staged full performances in Barrhead five times, most recently &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; in 2006, using a mobile performance venue set up in Barrhead Sports Centre.

There are several public houses in Barrhead. These include Cross Stobs, The Kelburn, The Arthurlie Inns, and The Brig Inn. The Cross Stobs dates back to at least 1695.

==Sports==
An active Scottish Junior football team, Arthurlie, plays in Barrhead, with a previous club of the same name having played as a senior league side until 1929. The earlier team was renowned for its 4–2 defeat of Celtic in the 1897 Scottish Cup. Arthurlie&#x27;s Johnny Kelly went on to play for Celtic and Barnsley and won several caps for Scotland. The team won the Scottish Junior Cup in 1998.

Alex McLeish, Scotland&#x27;s most capped defender with 77 caps and national team coach, went to school in Barrhead. In the early 20th century, the town produced three brothers, Alec Logan, James Logan and Tommy Logan who all played for either Scotland or the Scottish League XI.

Barrhead Boys Club, founded in 1972 and recently renamed as Barrhead Youth Football Club, caters for children as young as 6 years old, up to 21, and also has adult and veteran teams.

Barrhead is home to four bowling clubs: Barrhead, Arthurlie, Shanks, and St John&#x27;s. Founded in 1904, the Fereneze Golf Club is the town&#x27;s mature moorland 18-hole course boasting spectacular panoramic views over the Clyde Valley. Barrhead Boxing Club has produced several contenders at Scottish Amateur level as well as several professional contenders in recent years, while the town&#x27;s several Muay Thai clubs have produced some notable championship fighters.
A greyhound racing track, was opened on ground off the Aurs Road on Saturday 7 July 1934. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The track raced over 300 and 325 yards. The date of closure is not known.

==Churches==
Major churches in Barrhead include St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church on Aurs Road, the Church of Scotland parish churches of Bourock and St. Andrew&#x27;s, both on Main Street, and the United Reformed Church on Arthurlie Street.

There is also a Methodist church and several small Evangelical churches. There is also a small Church of God in Barrhead.

==In literature==
Barrhead Station features in The Five Red Herrings, a detective novel by Dorothy L Sayers.

<doc id="571570" wikidata="Q17067874" url="?curid=571570" title="Low-protein diet">
<text>A low-protein diet is a diet in which people decrease their intake of protein. A low-protein diet is used as a therapy for inherited metabolic disorders, such as phenylketonuria and homocystinuria, and can also be used to treat kidney or liver disease. Low protein consumption appears to reduce the risk of bone breakage presumably through changes in calcium homeostasis. Consequently, there is no uniform definition of what constitutes low-protein, because the amount and composition of protein for an individual with phenylketonuria would differ substantially from one with homocystinuria or tyrosinemia.

== History ==

By studying the composition of food in the local population in Germany, Carl von Voit established a standard of 118 grams of protein per day. Russell Henry Chittenden showed that less than half that amount was needed to maintain good health.

== Protein requirement ==

The daily requirement for humans to remain in nitrogen balance is relatively small. The median human adult requirement for good quality protein is approximately 0.65 gram per kilogram body weight per day and the 97.5 percentile is 0.83 grams per kilogram body weight per day. Children require more protein, depending on the growth phase. A 70 kg adult human who was in the middle of the range would require approximately 45 grams of protein per day to be in nitrogen balance. This would represent less than 10% of kilocalories in a notional 2,200 kilocalorie ration. William Cumming Rose and his team studied the essential amino acids, helping to define minimum amounts needed for normal health. For adults, the recommended minimum amounts of each essential amino acid varies from 4 to 39 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day. To be of good quality, protein only needs to come from a wide variety of foods; there is neither a need to mix animal and plant food together nor a need to complement specific plant foods, such as rice and beans. The notion that such specific combinations of plant protein need to be made to give good quality protein stems from the book &quot;Diet for a Small Planet&quot;. Plant protein is often described as incomplete, suggesting that they lack one or more of the essential amino acids. Apart from rare examples, such as Taro, each plant provides an amount of all the essential amino acids. However, the relative abundance of the essential amino acids is more variable in plants than that found in animals, which tend to be very similar in essential amino acid abundance, and this has led to the misconception that plant proteins are deficient in some way.

== Low-protein vs calorie restriction ==

Calorie restriction has been demonstrated to increase the life span and decrease the age-associated morbidity of many experimental animals. Increases in longevity or reductions in age-associated morbidity have also been shown for model systems where protein or specific amino acids have been reduced. In particular, experiments in model systems in rats, mice, and Drosophila fruit flies have shown increases in life-span with reduced protein intake comparable to that for calorie restriction. Restriction of the amino acid methionine, which is required to initiate protein synthesis, is sufficient to extend lifespan. Restriction of the branched-chain amino acids is sufficient to extend the lifespan of Drosophila fruit flies and male mice.

Some of the most dramatic effects of calorie restriction are on metabolic health, promoting leanness, decreasing blood sugar and increasing insulin sensitivity. Low-protein diets mimic many of the effects of calorie restriction but may engage different metabolic mechanisms. Low protein diets rapidly reduce fat and restores normal insulin sensitivity to diet-induced obese mice. Specifically restricting consumption of the three branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine is sufficient to promote leanness and improve regulation of blood glucose. A recent randomized-controlled clinical trial showed that protein restriction (PR) improves multiple markers of metabolic health, such as reducing adiposity and improving insulin sensitivity.

The diets of humans living in some of the Blue Zones, regions of enhanced numbers of centenarians and reduced age-associated morbidity, contain less than 10% of energy from protein, although reports on all the Blue Zones are not available. None of the diets in these regions is completely based on plants, but plants form the bulk of the food eaten. Although it has been speculated that some of these populations are under calorie restriction, this is contentious as their smaller size is consistent with the lower food consumption.

== Low-protein and osteoporosis ==

The effect of protein on osteoporosis and risk of bone fracture is complex. Calcium loss from bone occurs at protein intake below requirement when individuals are in negative protein balance, suggesting that too little protein is dangerous for bone health. IGF-1, which contributes to muscle growth, also contributes to bone growth, and IGF-1 is modulated by protein intake.

However, at high protein levels, a net loss of calcium may occur through the urine in neutralizing the acid formed from the deamination and subsequent metabolism of methionine and cysteine. Large prospective cohort studies have shown a slight increase in risk of bone fracture when the quintile of highest protein consumption is compared to the quintile of lowest protein consumption. In these studies, the trend is also seen for animal protein but not plant protein, but the individuals differ substantially in animal protein intake and very little in plant protein intake. As protein consumption increases, calcium uptake from the gut is enhanced. Normal increases in calcium uptake occur with increased protein in the range 0.8 grams to 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. However, calcium uptake from the gut does not compensate for calcium loss in the urine at protein consumption of 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. Calcium is not the only ion that neutralizes the sulphate from protein metabolism, and overall buffering and renal acid load also includes anions such as bicarbonate, organic ions, phosphorus and chloride as well as cations such as ammonium, titrateable acid, magnesium, potassium and sodium.

The study of potential renal acid load (PRAL) suggests that increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and cooked legumes increases the ability of the body to buffer acid from protein metabolism, because they contribute to a base forming potential in the body due to their relative concentrations of proteins and ions. However, not all plant material is base forming, for example, nuts, grains and grain products add to the acid load.

<text>The Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 is a turboshaft engine currently produced by Safran Helicopter Engines. The RTM322 was originally conceived and manufactured by Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Limited, a joint venture between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca (now Safran Helicopter Engines). The engine was designed to suit a wide range of military and commercial helicopter designs. The RTM322 can also be employed in maritime and industrial applications.

The Safran Aneto is a later development targeted for the super-medium and heavy helicopters, developed by Safran Helicopter Engines covering the range.

==Development==

The engine was designed for the Hughes AH-64 Apache and Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk, competing with the General Electric T700 and the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW100.
The partners shared the £100 million development costs equally, Rolls-Royce made the turbines, the combustor, and the inlet particle separator while Turbomeca produced the axial-centrifugal compressor and intake.

The engine first ran on 15 December 1984, with eight bench prototypes for 30,000 cycles and 13,000 test hours, and four for flight tests, initially aiming for type certification to be issued in 1987.

The first order for the RTM322 was received in 1992 to power 44 Royal Navy AugustaWestland Merlin HM1s which subsequently entered service in 1998.
Over 1,100 engines are in service, having logged over one million flight hours, powering 60% of the Agusta-Westland AW101 fleet and 80% of in-service NH90s.

In 2013, Turbomeca (part of the Safran Group, and now known as Safran Helicopter Engines) acquired the entire programme, becoming responsible for both production and product support. Safran Helicopter Engines has since developed a new engine derived from the RTM322, known as the Aneto.

==Safran Aneto==
The first 2,500 shp -1K was selected to power the Leonardo AW149 and Leonardo AW189K twin to extend its capabilities, it flew in March 2017 and was scheduled to be introduced in the fourth quarter of 2018.
The more powerful 3,000+ shp “Dash 3” should appear in the early 2020s and will feature a new compressor and hot section.
The required documentation was expected to be handed to the EASA in early 2019 for a second quarter certification.
By October 2018, the programme had accumulated 4,000 hours, including 105 hours of flight time. In 2018 Sikorsky was considering re-engining its CT7-powered S-92.

The Aneto-1K was added on the RTM 322 type certificate on 12 December 2019.

===Design===

As an RTM322 variant, the Aneto is a two spool turboshaft with a three stage axial compressor and a single stage centrifugal compressor turning at 36,300rpm, a reverse flow annular combustor, a two stage gas generator axial turbine and a two stage axial power turbine with a forward transmission shaft turning at 21,000rpm. Fitted with an inlet particle separator, its accessory gearbox is driven by the gas generator and the engine is control by a FADEC.

Built upon the Safran Tech 3000 technological demonstrator, it aims to gradually offer up to 15% better fuel economy over current competitors to improve payload-range and offers 25% better power density than existing engines of same volume. Offered for new or for existing models, fewer scheduled maintenance tasks, longer maintenance intervals and health monitoring should improve maintainability.

Suited for 8–15 ton helicopters, it is developed from the RTM322: the -1K has a similar architecture but no common parts. Parts made by additive manufacturing are used in the gyratory combustion chamber and the inlet guide vane system. Compatible with hybrid and distributed propulsion systems, in cruise flight one of the two engines could be shut down and restarted when needed. In the AW189, it is offered along the incumbent General Electric CT7, needing minor changes to the top-deck structure and engine cowls. Exempted from U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations, it could power the AW189&#x27;s military derivative, the AW149 or a future attack helicopter based on its dynamic systems.

Developed from a French Aviation Authority study, the Safran Power Pack Eco Mode on the Airbus Helicopters Racer allows it to shut down one of engines in cruise, lowering fuel consumption by 15%, and quickly and automatically reactivate it with an electric starter to its maximum power for acceleration, landing or emergencies. The Aneto specific fuel consumption should be 10% better than the competing CT7s.

==Applications==
*AgustaWestland Apache
*AgustaWestland AW101
*NHIndustries NH90
* Also used in Eurocopter X3

===Aneto===
* Leonardo AW149

<doc id="571575" wikidata="Q510876" url="?curid=571575" title="Venus of Lespugue">
<text>The Venus of Lespugue is a Venus figurine, a statuette of a female figure of the Gravettian, dated to between 26,000 and 24,000 years ago.

==Discovery==
It was discovered in 1922 in the Rideaux cave of Lespugue (Haute-Garonne) in the foothills of the Pyrenees by René de Saint-Périer (1877-1950).

Approximately 6 inches (150 mm) tall, it is carved from tusk ivory, and was damaged during excavation.

==Features==
Of all the steatopygous Venus figurines discovered from the upper Paleolithic, the Venus of Lespugue, if the reconstruction is sound, appears to display the most exaggerated female secondary sexual characteristics, especially the extremely large, pendulous breasts.

According to textile expert Elizabeth Wayland Barber, the statue displays the earliest representation found of spun thread, as the carving shows a skirt hanging from below the hips, made of twisted fibers, frayed at the end.

==Location==
The Venus of Lespugue resides in France, at the Musée de l&#x27;Homme.

<doc id="571581" wikidata="Q439088" url="?curid=571581" title="Richard Virenque">
<text>Richard Virenque (born 19 November 1969) is a retired French professional road racing cyclist. He was one of the most popular French riders with fans for his boyish personality and his long, lone attacks. He was a climber, best remembered for winning the King of the Mountains competition of the Tour de France a record seven times, but he is best known from the general French public as one of the central figures in a widespread doping scandal in 1998, the Festina Affair, and for repeatedly denying his involvement despite damning evidence.

==Childhood==
Virenque, his parents, his brother Lionel and sister Nathalie lived in the Iseba district of Casablanca. The family was affluent, employing both a gardener and a nurse. His mother described Richard as a gentle, kind boy, full of life, who enjoyed helping her in the garden. His idol was Michael Jackson. His father, Jacques, ran a tire company. As a child, Virenque began cycling by riding round the garden of the family&#x27;s house. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t much of a bike,&quot; he said. &quot;It had no mudguards, no brakes, and I had to scrape my foot along the ground to stop.&quot; Virenque often skipped school to fish on the beach. He told a court during the Festina doping inquiry (see below): 
The family moved to La Londe-les-Maures, near the Côte d&#x27;Azur, in 1979 when he was nine. There his father failed to find the same sort of job and relations between his parents suffered. Jacques and Bérangère Virenque divorced soon afterwards and Virenque said he was devastated. 

He couldn&#x27;t stand being in school any longer than he had to, he said, and he left to work as a plumber. 

==Early career==

Cycle-racing did not immediately inspire Virenque. His brother, Lionel, cycled, read specialist magazines and watched the Tour de France on television. 

He rode for the Vélo Club Hyèrois from the age of 13 where, encouraged by his grandfather, he took out his first licence with the Fédération Française de Cyclisme He said he knew he could climb well from the start.
His first win was in a race round the town at La Valette-du-Var, when he and another rider, Pascale Ranucci, lapped the field. He then did his national service in the army battalion at Joinville in Paris to which talented sportsmen were often sent. He spent his last period as an amateur with the ASPTT in Paris.

In 1990 he came eighth in the world championship road race at Utsunomiya, Tochigi in Japan, riding &quot;une course d&#x27;enfer&quot; to impress Marc Braillon, the head of the professional team, RMO, said Pascal Lino. &quot;I was riding like a kamikaze. I rode out of my skin,&quot; Virenque said. It worked: Braillon offered him a contract.

==Professional career==

He turned professional for RMO in January 1991. Virenque rode his first Tour de France in 1992 as a replacement for another team member, Jean-Philippe Dojwa. He was earning 15,000 francs a month. He said he dreamed only of &quot;being able to follow the best in the mountains, riders like Claudio Chiappucci, Indurain, LeMond, Thierry Claveyrolat.&quot; On the third day he took the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification after a long breakaway with two other riders on the col de Marie-Blanque in the Pyrenees. He held it for a day, losing it next day to his team-mate Pascal Lino, who led for the next two weeks. Virenque finished second in the climbers&#x27; competition.

Virenque was sought by several teams after his first Tour and Cyrille Guimard said at the world championship at Benidorm that he had arranged for him to join his Castorama team, where he would replace Laurent Fignon. But the announcement was premature and Virenque joined another French team, Festina. He stayed there until the team dissolved in the wake of a doping scandal in 1998 (see below).

Virenque first wore the yellow jersey of the Tour de France in 1992 and for the last time in 2003. In 2003 he won the stage to Morzine and wore the jersey on the climb of Alpe d&#x27;Huez. Virenque was a talented climber but a modest time-triallist. He was coached for time-trials by Jeannie Longo and her husband.

Virenque finished twice on the podium in the Tour de France (third in 1996 and second in 1997) and won several stages, among them Mont Ventoux in 2002. He is the 18th rider in the Tour to have won stages over 10 years apart; he wore the Maillot Jaune for two days in his entire career.

==Festina affair==
In 1998 the Festina cycling team was disgraced by a doping scandal (see Doping at the Tour de France) after a soigneur, Willy Voet, was found when crossing from Belgium to France to have drugs used for doping. They were, said John Lichfield, the Paris correspondent of &quot;The Independent&quot; in Britain: &quot;235 doses of erythropoietin (EPO), an artificial hormone which boosts the red cells (and therefore endurance) but can thicken the blood to fatal levels if not controlled properly. They also found 82 doses of a muscle-strengthening hormone called Sauratropine; 60 doses of Pantestone, a derivative of testosterone, which boosts body strength but can cause cancer; and sundry pain-deadening corticoids and energy-fuelling amphetamines.&quot; Bruno Roussel, Virenque&#x27;s directeur sportif, told L&#x27;Équipe that Virenque responded to the news by saying: 

Virenque&#x27;s teammates, Christophe Moreau, Laurent Brochard and Armin Meier, admitted taking EPO after being arrested during the Tour and were disqualified. Virenque maintained his innocence.
While his former team-mates were served six-month suspensions and returned to racing in spring 1999, Virenque changed teams to Polti in January 1999 and prepared for the 1999 Tour by riding the Giro d&#x27;Italia, in which he won a stage. Another Italian, his team-mate Enrico Cassani, said Virenque was referred to in Italy as &quot;the shit&quot;. He said: &quot;When he arrived, we were originally against him. Then, very quickly, we saw he knew how to live and to joke and we respected him. He proved he had some character, some personality.&quot;

A few weeks later Virenque&#x27;s name emerged in an inquiry into Bernard Sainz, the so-called Dr Mabuse of cycling who was later jailed for practising as an unqualified doctor. Franco Polti, the head of Virenque&#x27;s team, fined him 30 million lire.

Race director Jean-Marie Leblanc banned Virenque from the 1999 Tour de France but was obliged to accept him after a ruling by the Union Cycliste Internationale.

&quot;Cycling Weekly&quot; in Britain called it &quot;a major blow&quot; to the Tour&#x27;s organisers. Leblanc said he hoped Virenque would not win.

Virenque rode, at his team&#x27;s request, on a bicycle painted white with red dots to resemble the polka dot jersey worn by the leader of the mountains classification and he travelled between stages with a bodyguard, Gilles Pagliuca. That year, he wrote &quot;Ma Vérité&quot;, a book which asserted his innocence and included comments of how doping must be fought. He wrote that his team-mates confessed to using EPO because of pressure from the police. He said Moreau&#x27;s urine showed EPO had not been detected.

The Festina affair led to a trial in Lille, northern France, in October 2000. Virenque was a witness with others from the former Festina team. He at first denied he had doped himself but then confessed. &quot;Oui, je me suis dopé&quot;, he told the court&#x27;s president, Daniel Delegove, on 24 October. But he denied doping himself intentionally. Voet said he was aware of what he was doing and participated in trafficking between cyclists. Virenque said this happened without his approval. That led the satirical television programme, &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;info&quot; - which displayed Virenque as a moronic rubber puppet with hypodermics in his head - to change his words to &quot;à l&#x27;insu de mon plein gré&quot; (&quot;willingly but without knowing&quot;), and the phrase passed into French popular culture as a sign of hypocritical denial. Voet wrote a book, &quot;Massacre à la Chaîne&quot;, published in a legally-censored English edition as &quot;Breaking the Chain&quot;, in which he came close to identifying Virenque as an unrepentant doper.

==Post-trial reaction==

Virenque was criticised by the media and satirists for his denial in the face of increasing evidence and his pretence of having been doped without his knowledge. Voet wrote in &quot;Le Journal du Dimanche&quot; that he preferred Virenque as a young pro &quot;because he didn&#x27;t dope himself much&quot;. Many former colleagues shunned him, remembering his arrogance and criticism.

Virenque lived near Geneva in Switzerland and the Swiss cycling association suspended him for nine months. The president of the committee which imposed the ban, Bernard Welten, said he deserved a severe penalty because he was one of the biggest drug-takers in the team. The president of the French federation, Daniel Baal, said nine months was halfway between the minimum penalty of six months and the maximum of a year for a first-time offence. The sentence was reduced by an independent tribunal to six and a half. He was fined the equivalent of 2,600 euros and told to pay 1,300 euros in costs. He became depressed. &quot;I had to realise that I wasn&#x27;t anything any more,&quot; he said. His wife Stéphanie said he put on two sizes in clothes and 10 kg (22 lb) more than his racing weight. He wept repeatedly. She said she would stay with him and support him only if they moved back in the south of France after four years in Switzerland.

In the meantime they had the help of a prominent neighbour, Laurent Jalabert. The two had not been friends and did not see each other much in Switzerland. Then, Jalabert opened links by getting his wife, Sylvie, to ask Stéphanie Virenque for the loan of a vacuum cleaner that she didn&#x27;t actually need. Jalabert said that later, &quot;Richard called me one day when my wife and I were getting ready to move house. He was desperate to help us even though we didn&#x27;t really need any help. It was then that I realised his distress. He spent the whole day taking the furniture apart and putting it back together again. It&#x27;s odd, but that day did him an awful lot of good.&quot; Jalabert and his wife Sylvie said that, as a souvenir, they had kept the doors of one of their closets upside down because that was the way Virenque had fitted them. The two men began training together. Virenque and his family moved back to France as his wife asked. Jalabert followed shortly after his own career ended.

==Post-suspension career==

Few teams were willing to consider him when he completed his suspension and only a few friends kept in touch.

Cofidis was said to be interested but not in his first year back. Jean Delatour, with whom Virenque trained in the winter, said it could be interested if it found more sponsorship. On 5 July 2001 he joined Domo-Farm Frites, with the help of the former Tour de France winner, Eddy Merckx who, as supplier of the team&#x27;s bikes, put up the extra money that the main sponsors would not. He was paid the equivalent of £800 a month, the minimum wage, for the last three months of the year and the same salary for which he had first turned professional in 1992. Domo kept him the following season, after Farm Frites withdrew as co-sponsor, because it wanted to expand its carpet business in France. On 25 October 2002, on the eve of the Tour de France presentation at the Palais des Congres in Paris, he signed for another two years.

Virenque returned to prominence by winning Paris–Tours on 7 October 2001 in a day-long breakaway in which he dropped Jacky Durand and crossed the line seconds ahead of the peloton. Paris–Tours is a flat race that favours sprinters and not climbers. &quot;It was a typical Virenque moment,&quot; Fotheringham wrote, &quot;with a yell of anger as he crossed the line &#x27;for all those who tried to destroy me&#x27;&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 6/6/2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The French magazine, &quot;Vélo&quot;, called the victory &quot;extraordinary.&quot; &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;″s one-word headline on the front page was &quot;Unbelievable!&quot;
Virenque said: &quot;Jacky asked me if we should sit up [give up the breakaway attempt]. There were still 50 km [30 miles] to go. I was longing for someone else to come up to us. A long break wasn&#x27;t the idea. But when I saw the gap was rising, I shouted&#x27; &quot;Faut y croire&quot; &#x27; [We can do it/We have to believe] But he said he&#x27;d run dry.&quot;

While Virenque was bettered by Laurent Jalabert in the 2001 and 2002 Tour de France for the King of the Mountains competition, he won his sixth mountains classification in 2003 to tie with Federico Bahamontes and Lucien Van Impe. His day-long breakaway also saw him wear the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. In 2004 he won the King of the Mountains for a record seventh time. Van Impe criticised Virenque for being opportunistic rather than the best climber; he said he had himself refrained from breaking Bahamontes&#x27; record himself out of reverence. Virenque said they were jealous: &quot;They couldn&#x27;t stand being equal best and they couldn&#x27;t stand being beaten.&quot;

Bahamontes in turn described Virenque as &quot;a great rider, but not a complete rider&quot;, and compares him unfavorably as a climber with Charly Gaul and Van Impe.

Virenque ran into trouble again in 2002 when he appeared on a television programme, &quot;Tout le Monde en Parle&quot;, in June. The presenter, Thierry Ardisson, asked him: &quot;If you were sure of winning the Tour by being doped but knew you would not get caught, would you do it?&quot; Virenque replied: &quot;Win the Tour doped, but without getting caught? Yes.&quot; The programme was recorded to be broadcast as-live. Ardisson said that Virenque asked after the recording finished that his answer be cut out. Ardisson said: &quot;It was very naive, very Virenque. But it&#x27;s a shame that, once again, he didn&#x27;t want to tell the truth.&quot;

==Retirement==
Virenque rode the Olympic Games road race in Athens and decided to retire, a decision he announced at the Olympia theatre in Paris on 24 September 2004. His wife had suggested continuing one more season, he said. He stayed in the public eye, winning &quot;Je suis une célébrité, sortez-moi de là!&quot; (the French version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;) in Brazil in April 2006. In autumn 2005 he opened Virenque Design, a company to design and sell jewellery 
often featuring the number 7, representing his wins in the King of the Mountains. Since 2005 he has been a consultant commentator for Eurosport, alongside Jacky Durand and Jean-François Bernard and the journalist, Patrick Chassé, where he is described as a &quot;modest competitor&quot; to Laurent Jalabert, the specialist on the rival state network. He has also promoted an energy drink and a pharmacy company.

Virenque also took part in the Spa 24 Hours endurance race in 2005. Driving a Dodge Viper GTS-R for Force One Racing alongside François Labhardt, Philippe Prette and former motorcycle rider Didier de Radiguès, he finished the race in 12th place overall and second in the G2 class.

On 11 August 2006, Virenque was taken to hospital at Moûtiers and transferred to Grenoble after falling during a mountain-bike race at Méribel. He broke his nose and needed 32 stitches to his face. Hitting his head led to feelings of worry and of depression, he said, and he lost his sense of smell.

==Personal life==
In December 2007, Virenque and his wife, Stéphanie, divorced after 17 years together. They have two children, Clara and Dario.

Éric Boyer said of Virenque&#x27;s retirement: &quot;Richard has character, a strong personality. He doesn&#x27;t let himself go. He looks forwards, never behind. Today, he is a personality [&quot;un people&quot;]. His return to everyday life has been a success but money isn&#x27;t an end in itself.&quot;

Virenque lives at Carqueiranne in the Var region. He is fond of marmots, dancing, wine, gardening and flowers; he is quoted as saying, &quot;Put me in a good garden nursery and I&#x27;m in heaven,&quot;

<text>Better Living Through Chemistry is the debut studio album by English electronic music producer Fatboy Slim. It was released on 23 September 1996 in the United Kingdom by Skint Records and in the United States by Astralwerks. It was Fatboy Slim&#x27;s first work to chart outside of the UK, with the single &quot;Going Out of My Head&quot; notably charting in the US, and was certified gold by the BPI.

==Background==
Skint Records founder Damian Harris has described the album as having been &quot;more of a compilation than an album&quot;, as some of the tracks had been recorded some time before its release, due to Norman Cook&#x27;s other musical projects. Three songs from the album were previously released in Skint&#x27;s first volume of their &quot;Brassic Beats&quot; compilation album series, which is advertised in the album&#x27;s booklet.

The album&#x27;s cover features an image of a 3.5-inch floppy disk, paying homage to the cover of New Order&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; single, which featured a 5.25-inch disk. The album&#x27;s title is a variation of a DuPont advertising slogan, &quot;Better Things for Better Living...Through Chemistry&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The album received generally positive reviews from critics. A 1997 review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; claimed the album to be &quot;of the most fun, shamelessly genre-hopping dance albums of the year&quot;. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called the album &quot;the first to open the drums &#x27;n&#x27; bass world to naturally occurring rhythm patterns... The terrific &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; offers a parade of block-rockin&#x27; beats not born in a test tube.&quot; AllMusic rated it four stars out of five, recommending the album to &quot;those who can&#x27;t get enough of the popular technoid-sampled alternative dance style of the late &#x27;90s&quot;.

==Legacy==

<doc id="571595" wikidata="Q7073093" url="?curid=571595" title="N-Octyl β-D-thioglucopyranoside">
<text>&quot;n&quot;-Octyl β--thioglucopyranoside (octylthioglucoside, OTG) is a mild nonionic detergent that is used for cell lysis or to solubilise membrane proteins without denaturing them. This is particularly of use in order to crystallise them or to reconstitute them into lipid bilayers. It has a critical micelle concentration of 9 mM.

It is an analog of the commonly used detergent octyl glucoside, the presence of the thioether linkage making it resistant to degradation by beta-glucosidase enzymes.

== Preparation ==
N-alkyl thioglycosides of the &quot;n&quot;-octyl-β--thioglucopyranoside type are not naturally occurring. However, mustard oil glycosides are common natural S-glycosides.

The synthesis of &quot;n&quot;-octyl-β--thioglucopyranoside starts from D-glucose (I) which is prepared with acetic anhydride and concentrated sulfuric acid to give α--glucopyranose pentaacetate (pentaacetylglucose) (II). Pentaacetylglucose is reacted with hydrogen bromide to give 2,3,4,6-tetra-&quot;O&quot;-acetyl-α--glucopyranosyl bromide (acetobromo glucose) (III) which yields with thiourea in acetone almost quantitatively the isothiuronium salt 2,3,4,6-tetra-&quot;O&quot;-acetyl-β--glucopyranosyl-1-isothiuronium bromide (IV).

The nucleophilic thiolate anion formed after neutralization and reduction with sodium sulfite to the thiol in the alkaline reacts again almost quantitatively with 1-bromoctane to &quot;n&quot;-octyl-2,3,4,6-tetra-&quot;O&quot;-acetyl-1-thio-β--glucopyranoside (peracetylated octylthioglucoside) (V). From V, the target product n-octyl-1-thio-β--glucopyranoside (VI) can be obtained in an overall yield of about 80% via the quantitatively proceeding alkaline deacetylation by means of sodium hydroxide in methanol.

In the trichloroacetimidate method of Richard R. Schmidt, the peracetylated &quot;O&quot;-(α--glucopyranyl) trichloroacetimidate forms with 1-octanethiol via boron trifluoride-etherate catalysis upon inversion exclusively &quot;n&quot;-octyl-1-thio-β--glucopyranoside (after deacetylation), while the perbenzylated &quot;O&quot;-(α--glucopyranyl) trichloroacetimidate is converted upon retention to the &quot;n&quot;-octyl-1-thio-α--glucopyranoside (after debenzylation).

The reaction of -glucose with 1-octanethiol and Olah&#x27;s reagent (70% hydrogen fluoride HF in pyridine) produces an anomeric mixture of &quot;n&quot;-octyl-1-thio-α,β--glucopyranoside in 95% yield which contains 44% α-anomeres and 56% β-anomers.

The pure α-octylthioglucoside is accessible by reaction of pentacetyl-β--glucose (from -glucose, acetic anhydride and sodium acetate) in organic solvents at elevated temperatures with 1-octanethiol and boron trifluoride etherate and subsequent deacetylation.

== Properties ==
&quot;n&quot;-octyl-β--1-thioglucopyranoside is a colorless, odorless, hygroscopic, crystalline solid which readily dissolves in water and short-chain alcohols. Compared with the &quot;O&quot;-glucoside &quot;n&quot;-octyl-β--glucopyranoside, which has already been introduced earlier as detergent for biochemical applications, the analogous &quot;S&quot;-glucoside OTG appears to be particularly suitable due to its higher stability, especially against degradation by β-glucosidases.
++ very good + good (+) ok (-) poor – very poor

The cost advantage for octylthioglucoside stated in publications from the 1980s is evidently no longer given because of the recently developed, efficient enzymatic synthesis pathways for O-octylglucoside (directly from D-glucose, 1-octanol by means of β-glucosidase).

The α-anomeric octylthioglucoside exhibits liquid crystalline properties forming a smectic phase A.

== Application ==
Nonionic detergents solubilize membrane proteins gently and (largely) preserving their physiological function by interaction with the hydrophobic membrane regions embedded in the lipid bilayers of cell membranes. Above the so-called critical micelle concentration CMC [OTG: 9 mM, or 0.2772% (w/v)], mixed micelles of membrane proteins and surfactant molecules are formed, with OTG concentrations of 1.1-1.2% (w/v) for the solubilization of membrane proteins from E. coli. No denaturation of the membrane proteins was found after solubilization with octylthioglucoside.

For the analysis of the biological activity of membrane proteins, it is often necessary to reconstitute the proteins into the lipid bilayers of liposomes. For this, the solution of the solubilized protein is subject to dialysis or ion exchange chromatography in the presence of phospholipids or membrane lipid mixtures to remove the surfactant. For example, 95% of the OTG can be removed from a 43 mM surfactant solution under standard conditions within 6 hours.

Octylthioglucoside (15 mM) is clearly superior to its O-analog octyl glucoside (OT) in the solubilization and stabilization against thermal and light-induced denaturation of the light-driven proton pump Bacteriorhodopsin from the biomembranes of halobacteria.

<doc id="571599" wikidata="Q552113" url="?curid=571599" title="Venus of Dolní Věstonice">
<text>The Venus of Dolní Věstonice () is a Venus figurine, a ceramic statuette of a nude female figure dated to 31,000–27,000 years ago (Gravettian industry). It was found at the Paleolithic site Dolní Věstonice in the Moravian basin south of Brno, in the base of Děvín Mountain in what is today the Czech Republic. This figurine and a few others from locations nearby are the oldest known ceramic articles in the world.

==Description==
It has a height of , and a width of at its widest point and is made of a clay body fired at a relatively low temperature (500–800 °C). The statuette follows the general morphology of the other Venus figurines: exceptionally large breasts, belly and hips, perhaps symbols of fertility, relatively small head and little detail on the rest of the body. A feature which no longer remains a part of the sculpture, is the fact that it is thought to have been originally ornamented with four feathers. This is evidenced by the four small holes on the top of the head. Although the type of feather has not been determined, the holes are said to be produced with a tool that is relatively sharp – of which a feather would satisfy.

The palaeolithic settlement of Dolní Věstonice in Moravia, a part of Czechoslovakia at the time organized excavation began, now located in the Czech Republic, has been under systematic archaeological research since 1924, initiated by Karel Absolon. In addition to the Venus figurine, figures of animals – bear, lion, mammoth, horse, fox, rhino and owl – and more than 2,000 balls of burnt clay have been found at Dolní Věstonice.

The figurine was discovered on 13 July 1925 in a layer of ash, broken into two pieces. It was found situated in a central fireplace. Once on display at the Moravian Museum in Brno, it is now protected and only rarely accessible to the public. It was exhibited in the National Museum in Prague from 11 October 2006 until 2 September 2007 as a part of the exhibition &quot;Lovci mamutů&quot; (&quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot;). It was presented in the Moravian Museum in Brno at an expo &quot;Prehistoric Art in Central Europe&quot;. It has returned to depository as of June 2009. Scientists occasionally examine the statuette. A tomograph scan in 2004 found a fingerprint of a child estimated at between 7 and 15 years of age, fired into the surface; the child who handled the figurine before it was fired is considered by Králík, Novotný and (2002) to be an unlikely candidate for its maker.

<text>Cambridge ( ) is a hamlet in the district of Stroud, in the county of Gloucestershire, England. It lies on the A38 road between Bristol and Gloucester. It is about 3 miles (5 km) from Dursley and about 11 miles (18 km) from Gloucester.

The hamlet lies in the civil parish of Slimbridge and takes its name from the River Cam which flows through it. It has one public house, the George Inn. A second, the White Lion, closed and became a private residence. There are regular buses to Bristol, Gloucester, Stroud and Thornbury.

In nearby Slimbridge is the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, that was founded by Peter Scott.

In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Cambridge thus:

&quot;CAMBRIDGE, a hamlet in Slimbridge parish, Gloucester; on the river Cam, 4 miles NNW of Dursley. It has a post office under Stonehouse. It was known to the Saxons as Cwatbriege; and was the scene of a battle, in the time of Edward the Elder, between the Saxons and the Danes.&quot;

Bishop Ussher identified this Cambridge as the listed among the 28 cities of Britain by the &quot;History of the Britons&quot;, although this is more often identified with the Cambridge on the River Granta.

<text>Dolní Věstonice () is a municipality and village in Břeclav District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 300 inhabitants. It is known for the eponymous archaeological site.

==Geography==
Dolní Věstonice is located about northwest of Břeclav and south of Brno. It lies on the border between the Mikulov Highlands and Dyje–Svratka Valley. The highest point is at above sea level. The village is situated on the shore of the Nové Mlýny reservoirs. The municipality is partly located in the Pálava Protected Landscape Area. The area of the reservoir is protected as the Věstonice Reservoir Nature Reserve.

==History==

===Prehistoric times===

Dolní Věstonice is known for the Dolní Věstonice archaeological site. Approximately 25,000 years ago, during the Upper Paleolithic period of the Stone Age, a small settlement of mammoth hunters consisting of huts built with rocks and mammoth bones was founded on the site of what is now Dolní Věstonice. This is the oldest permanent human settlement that has ever been found. Numerous other archaeological discoveries point to extensive human habitation of the area in prehistoric times. The archaeological site is also known for the finding of the Venus of Dolní Věstonice, one of the most important archaeological discoveries in Europe and one of the oldest and most famous art in the world.

===9th–20th century===
During the Great Moravia period, which lasted between the 9th and 10th centuries, a small Slavic gord was built here. The gord protected a ford on an important trade route.

The first written mention of Věstonice is from 1312. During the 13th century the place became inhabited by German colonists. In 1460, the village was promoted to a market town by King George of Poděbrady. From the beginning of the 16th century until their expulsion in 1622, the Anabaptists settled here. They were famous for their high level of education and the establishment of wine cellars, which have survived to this day.

In 1938, it was annexed by Nazi Germany and administered as part of the Reichsgau Niederdonau. The German speaking population was expelled in 1945 according to the Beneš decrees and replaced by Czech settlers.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Dolní Věstonice is known for viticulture. The municipality lies in the Mikulovská wine subregion.

==Transport==
There are no railways or major roads passing through the municipality.

==Sights==

The main landmark of Dolní Věstonice is the Church of Saint Michael the Archangel. It is a Baroque building with a Gothic core and Renaissance tower. 

Tourist attractions follow the archaeological glory of the municipality. The archaeological site includes an outdoor exhibition. An educational archeological path leads from Dolní Věstonice to neighbouring Pavlov. 

Remains of the gord rampart and floor plan of the church, which stood here until the early 13th century, are preserved.

<doc id="571609" wikidata="Q203765" url="?curid=571609" title="Venus of Laussel">
<text>The Venus of Laussel is an limestone bas-relief of a nude woman. It is painted with red ochre and was carved into the limestone of a rock shelter (&quot;Abri de Laussel&quot;) in the commune of Marquay, in the Dordogne department of south-western France. The carving is associated with the Gravettian Upper Paleolithic culture (approximately 25,000 years old). It is currently displayed in the Musée d&#x27;Aquitaine in Bordeaux, France.


==Description==
The figure holds a bison horn, or possibly a cornucopia, in one hand, which has thirteen notches. She has large breasts, a great stomach, and wide hips. There is a &quot;Y&quot; on her thigh and her faceless head is turned toward the horn. The lower relief was covered in red ochre.

==Discovery and display==
The relief was discovered in 1911 by Jean-Gaston Lalanne, a physician. It was carved into large block of limestone in a rock shelter (&quot;abri de Laussel&quot;) at the commune of Marquay in the Dordogne department of south-western France. The limestone block fell off the wall of the shelter. It was brought to the Musée d&#x27;Aquitaine in Bordeaux, France.

== Meaning ==
The figure and the horn are considered significant in figurative studies of Paleolithic art. There are many similarly formed &quot;goddess figures&quot;, such as Venus of Willendorf, said to be of potential significance in Eurasian prehistoric religion. The color and the number of notches on the horn may symbolize the number of moons or the number of menstrual cycles in one year, or the number of days from menstruation to ovulation.

<text>Wacken Open Air (, abbreviated as W:O:A) is a heavy metal music festival, held annually since 1989 on the first weekend of August in the village of Wacken in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Almost all styles and subgenres of hard rock and metal are represented and hosted. It is now one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world and one of the largest open-air festivals in Germany. Between 2011 and 2018, the number of attendees was around 85,000, 75,000 of whom were paying visitors. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no 2020 and 2021 editions of Wacken Open Air.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The idea for Wacken Open Air was conceived in 1989 when Thomas Jensen and Holger Hübner visited a restaurant together. Both lived in Wacken and were friends, Jensen played the electric bass with rock cover band Skyline. From its beginnings until 1992, the band was composed of Ines Jeske from Vaale (vocals), Thomas Jensen from Wacken (bass), Peter Huhn from Wacken (electric guitar), Dennis Harman from Itzehoe (keyboard), and Andreas Göser from Wacken (drums). Skyline was one of the first regional Metal and Rock cover bands at that time. The band was regionally known, working its way from appearances in village pubs and gigs at biker meetings up to an appearance as supporting band of &quot;Extrabreit&quot;. Hübner was a disc jockey with a focus on Rock music and Heavy Metal. Jensen and Hübner developed the idea to organise an open-air concert in a gravel pit in Wacken and persuaded Skyline drummer Andreas Göser and Jörg Jensen, Thomas Jensen&#x27;s brother, to help make it happen. Until then, the pit had already served as a meeting venue for up to 3,000 members of biker club &#x27;No Mercys&#x27;, it was therefore perfectly suited for their plans and also presented an opportunity to attract motorcycle fans. From the beginning, it was clear that the focus of the event would be on Rock and Metal and that, in contrast to other single-day festivals such as Monsters of Rock or Super Rock in Mannheim, there would also be camping grounds.

=== Early years and initial development ===

The first two-day festival took place in the gravel pit on 24 and 25 August 1990 and barely had 800 visitors. The performing bands all hailed from Germany, and apart from Skyline, bands like 5th Avenue, Motoslug, Sacred Season, Axe &#x27;n Sex, and Wizzard played. The first festivals were organised privately, with the technology being built on a trailer borrowed from a local trucking company and the stage being a DIY construction.

In subsequent years, too, most of the tasks were carried out by the small team. Until August 1994, for example, ticket orders were organised privately by Andy Göser&#x27;s mother Regina Göser and security duties were performed by friendly motorcycle clubs up until 1996. In 1991, the number of visitors increased to 1,300, and with Skyline returning, Bon Scott, an AC/DC cover band from Hamburg, Gypsy Kyss, Kilgore, Life Artist, Ruby Red, and Shanghai&#x27;d Guts joined them on stage for an all-regional roster. That same year, the iconic skull logo was designed by Mark Ramsauer after the basic shape had been determined by Thomas Jensen and Holger Hübner. The cow skull refers to the venue, a meadow for cows, and to Jensen and Hübner as &quot;boys from the village&quot;.

In 1992, the programme changed to include internationally renowned bands such as Blind Guardian and Saxon for the first time, and the number of bands rose to 26, listing bands from Sweden, the US, Ireland, and Belgium. The organisers used a professional stage with lighting and PA for the first time and were able to win cigarette brand Prince Denmark as a sponsor. That year, the Party Stage was set up in the DJ tent next to the main stage, where cover bands and fun projects were to perform exclusively. The additional post-concert costs for garbage disposal on the campground, where 2,500 paying guests and many more were present and celebrated, as well as the significantly oversized security, among other things, meant that the organisers recorded a loss of around 25,000 D-Mark that year.

With the reunion of the band Fates Warning at the festival in 1993, Wacken Open Air had a special feature and also made a name for itself in the following years with unusual band constellations and reunions. At the same time, Doro Pesch and other well-known bands made for interesting appearances, which resulted in a new record attendance of 3,500 paying customers. Simultaneously, the team tried their hand at concert organisation and, under the moniker Stone Castle Promotion, held a Motörhead concert for 2,000 people in Flensburg which, unfortunately, could not cover its promotional costs. A show with Dio/Freak of Nature became a disaster with only 167 tickets sold, and together with the Open Air, which again recorded a minus, the organisers incurred debts of around 350,000 D-Mark. As a result, Jörg Jensen and Andreas Göser left the team; Holger Hübner and Thomas Jensen remained, as did Jörn-Ulf Goesmann for another two years, continuing to run the Wacken Open Air despite the debts for which their parents had provided guarantees. During the same year, Thomas Jensen&#x27;s mother died and Holger Hübner had a serious accident – the year went down in Wacken history as the &quot;year of the plague&quot;.

On its fifth anniversary in 1994, the financial situation stabilised and the festival finally broke even. The line-up remained professional and featured many internationally known bands from the metal scene. A total of 4,500 tickets were sold; on top of that, due to the rising costs of garbage disposal, tickets for the camping grounds had to be purchased separately, and pre-orders were rewarded with a free T-shirt. Also in 1995, income and expenses evened out thanks to the commitment of bands such as Tiamat, D-A-D, the Pretty Maids, and Angra. But even with roughly 5,000 attendees, the festival didn&#x27;t turn a profit. However, for the first time, national media became aware of Wacken Open Air, especially Rock Hard magazine, as well as the newly founded TV station VIVA with its Heavy Metal programme &quot;Metalla&quot;.

=== First achievements and growth ===
Ticket sales for the 1996 festival again started sluggishly, despite a headliner like Kreator and numerous internationally renowned bands such as The Exploited, Gorefest, and Crematory. Management tried to prevent another loss by securing more acts and finally managed to get Böhse Onkelz to perform. The engagement of the controversial band also led to criticism, and some bands cancelled their gig in Wacken that year. Cologne band Brings called off their gig on short notice and offered to refund their fans&#x27; ticket prices.

As a result of many visitors flooding the village in 1996, the inhabitants of Wacken voiced their concern over an event of this size being held in the local gravel pit. Uwe Trede offered to relocate the festival site to his own property and the areas previously used as campgrounds and took care of the acquisition of additional land. The organisational team grew to include Thomas Hess as production manager, who had previously been active as tour manager for Die Böhsen Onkelz, as well as Sheree Hesse for catering to the artists and VIPs. With the W.E.T.-Stage, a third stage was set up in 1997. The &quot;Wacken Evolution Tent&quot; was to be made available primarily to newcomers and bands without record deals. That year, the number of visitors reached 10,000 for the first time, with Rockbitch&#x27;s erotic stage show causing a scene.

=== Further development of the festival ===

Over the years, the size of Wacken Open Air has grown continuously, and now dozens of bands and tens of thousands of visitors flock to the festival. Even though the organisers said in 2006 that 62,500 visitors were &quot;the limit of what is possible&quot;, changes were made to the structure of the festival grounds the following year by allocating a larger area to the &quot;Party Stage&quot;. In addition, tickets could no longer be purchased directly on the festival grounds to reduce the number of spontaneous or ticketless visitors. In 2007 and 2008, the festival had already sold out as a result of advance ticket sales; for W:O:A 2009, tickets had even sold out by the end of 2008. The tickets for 2010, too, sold out months in advance.

While the festival originally only lasted two days, the performances have been lasting from Thursday to Saturday, i.e., three days, for some years. Thursday became a &quot;Night to Remember&quot;, with mainly &quot;classical&quot; Heavy Metal bands appearing, such as the Scorpions in 2006. On the actual Party Stage, younger and more modern bands play as a contrast to the &quot;Night to Remember&quot;. In addition, the event is accompanied by a rich complementary programme; in addition to a merchant area – obligatory for music festivals – a beer garden has been operating since 2000, in which the Wacken Firefighters&#x27; marching band opens the festival before its official start. On Thursday in 2007, the &quot;Hellfest Stage&quot; was initiated. Since 2009, there has been a &quot;Medieval Stage&quot;, where mainly Medieval and Folk Metal bands play.

The fact that many well-known bands, including the Scorpions, Saxon, Twisted Sister, Dimmu Borgir, Slayer, and Helloween, have recorded live DVDs at Wacken, shows how esteemed the Open Air has since become. Ahead of their farewell tour in 2004, Die Böhsen Onkelz also performed an extended set at W:O:A.

Since 2002, the so-called &quot;Metal Train&quot; has been travelling from Munich to Wacken and back before and after the festival to bring fans to the Northern German village and provide a matching entertainment programme. Bus tours from Scandinavian countries, especially Zurich and Sweden, but also from Austria, are organised each year and used by several hundred fans.

The &quot;W:O:A Soccercup&quot; has been taking place annually since 2002. This football tournament, which started with nine teams and takes place on Wednesdays, has grown over the years and has been held in World Cup mode with 32 teams since 2007 (a one-off event in 2011 featured 36 teams). The international teams register in advance and are composed of festival visitors. For the tournament&#x27;s 15th anniversary in 2016, a band was featured and took part for the first time: Serum 114 formed a team with several fans and were able to win the tournament. Although it is meant to be a fun tournament, in which creative outfits and names take precedence over athletic performance, the award ceremony after the tournament has been held on one of the stages since 2013 and prizes can be won.

In 2013, the &quot;Full Metal Church&quot; took place in Wacken for the first time. Marking the local church&#x27;s 150th anniversary, the team, together with the parish, organised a concert by the band Faun, which was framed by two readings and sermons by &quot;Volxbibel&quot; author Martin Dreyer. Both the concert and the services were completely overcrowded by festival visitors.
The festival is one of the Metal scene&#x27;s highlights of the year. Nowadays, about a third of the visitors, some of whom arrive quite some time before the official start of the festival, and the majority of the bands come from abroad. According to the organisers, 2018 saw visitors from more than 80 nations attending the festival.

The number of participants increased to 75,000 in 2008 and included 65,000 paying guests. In 2008, the festival sold out twice (W:O:A 2008 in spring and W:O:A 2009 on 31 December 2008).

As is common with festivals of this size, Wacken Open Air received criticism for its hygienic conditions, prices, security personnel, as well as for the overcrowding and commercial orientation of the event. These points of criticism were addressed by making further substantial investments in the festival&#x27;s fixed and mobile infrastructure. In 2008, the organisers also contributed 1,000,000 Euros to the expansion of Wacken&#x27;s local outdoor swimming pool in order to make the festival even more attractive to the residents and visitors of the town.

Since 2006, the festival has been running an online radio station called Wacken Radio, which broadcasts Metal music around the clock. It is being produced in cooperation with RauteMusik as of February 2014.

For the 23rd edition of Wacken Open Air, the sale of an &quot;X-Mas Package&quot; started on Monday, 8 August 2011, shortly after the end of that year&#x27;s festival, and was sold out within 45 minutes. The event sold out ten times in a row between 2006 and 2015. Tickets for Wacken Open Air 2015 sold out after just 12 hours on 4 August 2014 – just a few hours after the end of W:O:A 2014. The X-Mas Tickets for W:O:A 2016, which cost 10 Euros less and whose buyers were entitled to a free T-shirt, were completely sold out only 20 minutes after the start of pre-sales. Booking office Metaltix&#x27; servers were highly busy. In the minutes before the start of the pre-sale, the pages were no longer accessible; after that, data traffic had to be limited by wait lists.

Prices for the festival have risen and are currently at a level similar to other major Rock festivals, such as Rock am Ring and Hurricane Festival. After several years of success in which the festival sold out within hours, the first 60,000 tickets for the 2017 festival were sold in mid-2016. 55,000 tickets were sold within the first hour. By the end of April 2017, the festival was almost sold out except for a few remaining tickets. The price for the festival ticket was 220 Euros, but there was no fee for early arrival campers, who often set up their elaborately designed accommodations before the festival begins – partly to get the best spots near the festival grounds. In addition, all toilets and showers were free in 2017.

The festival sold out within a few days each in 2014–2016. However, the last tickets for the 2017 festival were sold after 309 days, a mere 2 months before the start of the festival, even though only 10,000 tickets remained after the first day of sales. This was a matter of speculation at first, and reasons such as the changed security situation or the price development were taken into account. Regardless of that, the festival sold out for the 13th time in a row in 2018.

On 5 April 2018, Thomas Hess, the festival&#x27;s longtime production (and former security) director, passed away. He had joined festival management in 1996 as a former tour manager of Böhse Onkelz and was considered one of the most important leading figures for the festival, along with the remaining founders and the Trede family, who organise the camping areas and the camping supervisors as subcontractors. He made a significant contribution to the W:O:A being so well organised, peaceful and successful.

Wacken Open Air 2018 was named the best major festival at the European Festival Awards 2018 and best festival at the Helga! Awards. For W:O:A 2019, all 75,000 tickets were sold within the first four days of sales, making this the 14th time in a row that the festival completely sold out.

=== 2020 and 2021 edition postponements ===
On 16 April 2020, it was announced that the 2020 edition of the festival would be cancelled because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first set of bands were announced on 1 August 2020 for the rescheduled festival for 2021.

On 1 June 2021, the promoters of Wacken Open Air announced that the festival would not take place this year, again due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and is scheduled to return in the summer of 2022, with more information and details to be announced in September 2021.

=== The festival post-Corona ===
2022 was the first edition that was able to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic. Headliners were Powerwolf, Slipknot and Judas Priest.

The 2023 edition was sold out in record time of 5 hours. Headliners were Iron Maiden, Heaven Shall Burn, Doro and Helloween. But for the first time in the festival&#x27;s history, they had to announce a travel stop for motorized vehicles due to heavy rainfall and storm alerts. This announcement came Wednesday morning, the day before the festival was supposed to officially start. The police estimated 50,000 festival goers were able to reach the festival by the time the travel stop was announced. The people who weren&#x27;t able to reach the festival were offered a full refund.

As per usual, the 2024 edition sold out, once again in a record time of 4.9 hours. Announced bands included Amon Amarth, KoЯn, Scorpions &amp; Blind Guardian.

== Organisation ==

The organisers of Wacken Open Air founded &quot;Stone Castle Rockpromotions&quot; in 1990 in order to organise the first festival. The name is derived from the direct translation of &quot;Steinburg&quot; from the district of Steinburg, to which Wacken belongs. Stone Castle remained the company&#x27;s name until 1996. Up until 2014, the headquarters were located in Dörpstedt (Schleswig-Flensburg district) and then moved to Wacken. The company&#x27;s name has been &quot;ICS&quot; (International Concert Service) GmbH since 1999. The company owns the label &quot;Wacken Records&quot; and the mailorder Metaltix, among others.

A daily festival newspaper has been available since 2007, reporting on what&#x27;s happening on the festival grounds. The Thursday edition is also included free of charge with all newspapers published by Schleswig-Holsteinischer Zeitungsverlag.

In 2014, the online radio station RauteMusik took over production of the official Wacken radio. Wacken Radio has its own container on the festival grounds every year, where it reports live.

Up until a few years ago, Wacken&#x27;s official town signs were either replaced by plastic signs spelling Heavy Metal Town during W:O:A or bolted more tightly because they were often stolen as souvenirs. Some shops are now selling black cotton bags with the Wacken town sign on one side and the words &quot;This town sign I may keep&quot; on the other.

An action for exceeding the maximum noise limit, brought before the Administrative Court of Schleswig by residents of Wacken, ended in January 2013 with an out-of-court settlement. Now, if the average noise level of the festival exceeds 70 dB, the organisers pay 1,000 Euros to the community, which donates the money to charitable causes.

In July 2022, it was announced that starting with W:O:A 2023 and onwards, the festival will be officially extended from three to four full days and that the Wednesday will be the new first full day. Up until 2022, while there was plenty of programme on Wednesdays, it was more of an unofficial afternoon introduction to the festival and Thursdays remained the official opening day.

=== Infrastructure ===
The site covers more than 240 hectares, which are divided by more than 45 kilometres of fence. The inner area, including the main stage, has a size of 43,000 square metres. More than 1,300 toilets and almost 500 showers are available for the 75,000 paying attendees. 2,200 trucks with equipment are needed for the entire festival. Stage construction and dismantling usually take 7 days and 5 days respectively. For this, 75 trucks of stage equipment (1,000 tons), 10 trucks of sound equipment and 27 trucks of lighting equipment are used.

Since 2014, the electric output has amounted to 12 megawatts, roughly matching the needs of a small town counting 70,000 inhabitants. In addition, 40 diesel-fuelled emergency power generators are required. 25 electricians are responsible for the power supply.

600,000 Euros were spent on the construction of sewage systems and the improvement of power supply on the festival grounds. At the same time, 700,000 Euros worth of drains were installed in front of the stages in order to improve the drainage of water masses during heavy rains. The main paths were also paved with 10 km of mobile roads to facilitate access for rescue vehicles.

A total of approximately 5,000 employees work for the festival, including 1,800 security staff members, 150 cleaners, 70 construction and dismantling assistants, as well as 400 police officers, 250 firefighters, 900 paramedics, and six emergency doctors.

In 2017, a beer pipeline measuring one kilometer to supply ten dispensing systems was used for the first time. At full capacity, this construction allowed for 10,000 litres of beer to be tapped within the hour.

=== Stages ===

Wacken Open Air now boasts eight stages for musicians and accompanying entertainment. The most important ones are the Faster and the Harder Stage, which are designed as connected twin stages and have a shared sound and lighting system. Together with the slightly smaller Louder Stage, these two stages make up the Infield, or The Holy Ground. All three stages are also equipped with video walls to allow visibility of the performers even from remote positions.

Up until 2016, these three stages were called Black Stage, True Metal Stage, and Party Stage. After Wacken 2016, visitors were encouraged to suggest new names. From these suggestions, the best ideas were to be put up to a vote in a survey. Instead, however, the slogan &quot;Faster - Harder - Louder&quot; became the inspiration for the names and the three stages were renamed accordingly.

Two more twin stages, the W.E.T. Stage (Wacken Evolution Tent) and the Headbanger Stage, are located inside a big tent called Bullhead City Circus. The Metal Battle takes place on these stages on Wednesday and Thursday, followed by regular band appearances on the days after.

While the large stages and tent stages are open to all genres, the remaining stages are dedicated to specific themes. The Wackinger Stage is located in the medieval area of the festival and is played primarily by bands from Folk, Pagan and Medieval genres, while the Wasteland Stage, which was established in 2014, is geared towards music with an apocalyptic touch. The Beergarden Stage is modelled after typical folk festival stages, but also accommodates permanent Wacken guests such as the Wacken Firefighters and Mambo Kurt.

=== Event area ===

Wacken Open Air&#x27;s event area is divided into several structurally separated sections. Since 2014, only one major security check is performed upon entering the grounds, after that, only the festival wristbands are checked.

Special features of the W:O:A include the Wackinger area, which resembles a medieval market and contains specialty food and beverage stalls as well as the Wackinger Stage, where matching music is played. Various walking acts also entertain the audience. This area borders on the Wasteland designed by the Wasteland Warriors, where a post-apocalyptic world and stage (Wastelandstage) styled in homage to the Mad Max-franchise is set up.

The area in front of the main stages comprises both the Bavarian beer garden and a large shopping mile called Metal Markt. There are also various food stalls, the Wacken Foundation Camp, ATMs, and the Movie Field, where Heavy Metal documentaries and feature films are screened.

The most important stages, the focal point of the festival, are located in the so-called Infield, which can be reached only via the Center. In addition to these stages, it also hosts food and beverage stalls.

=== Camping grounds ===

As Wacken Open Air only sells 3-day tickets, the majority of visitors spend the entire festival on-site. As a result, most of the more than 240 hectares of the festival site are designated camping areas. Camping opens on Monday and has been included in the ticket price since 2017. However, in the years before, an extra fee was charged for arrival before Wednesday.

The campsite is equipped with showers, flushing toilets, portable toilets, drinking fountains, small supermarkets, food stalls and information boards, and is continuously patrolled by the police, fire brigade and security services. A refuse collection service collects refuse bags on the premises.

Since the large crowds lead to a bottleneck situation in terms of mobile service, some providers now set up portable base stations for GSM, UMTS, and LTE+ during the festival.

=== Medical services ===
A festival of this size needs capable medical services, which here are called the Wacken Rescue Squad. Every year, hundreds of helpers from various relief organisations from all over Germany arrive before the festival to prepare the medical camp and care for people in need during the event. The medical service is managed by the local DRK association in Kaltenkirchen.

The visiting and local relief organisations provide vehicles and material during the course of the festival. These include ambulances and radios for communication in particular. Due to the road conditions, quads and foot patrols are often used in Wacken, especially in the vicinity of the medical centre. In addition to the medical service, which counts approx. 270 people at peak times, the rescue service cooperation Schleswig-Holstein has more than ten emergency vehicles (ambulances and mobile intensive care units) on site while coordinating the overall emergency management.

In 2013, around 3,300 people received medical care from approximately 500 medics.

=== Crime and accidents ===
Despite the size of the festival, no serious security problems have been encountered so far. Disputes among visitors are rare, and in 2011, a total of 20 reports of bodily injury was filed. The main problem consists of several hundred reported thefts each year. In 2011, police were able to arrest three gangs of thieves. In comparison to other events of this scale, the festival is classified by police as secure.

So far there have been four deaths and some serious injuries:

* In 2005, a heavily intoxicated 37-year-old crashed into an ambulance moving at walking pace and succumbed to his head injuries in the hospital. To support his family, organisers held a fundraising event; W:O:A 2006 honoured the deceased with a minute&#x27;s silence.
* In 2011, a rioting fan was overwhelmed by security guards in the village and died of cardiovascular arrest.
* In 2012, a 22-year-old festival visitor went to sleep near a generator and breathed in its carbon monoxide fumes. He could not be revived.
* In 2013, a 52-year-old visitor from Poland died of natural causes in his tent. That same year, a fan was seriously injured when the cartridge of his camping stove exploded for unknown reasons.
* In 2016, two men were injured when one of them set fire to illegal firecrackers and the other tried to stop him. Reports that one of the men&#x27;s ears had been torn off turned out to be false.
* In 2017, a 16-year-old was seriously injured while trying to refill a camping stove with denatured alcohol.

== Commitment ==

=== Metal Battle ===

W:O:A Metal Battle is an international band contest first held in 2004. During Metal Battle, newcomer bands compete against each other in national qualifiers and finals; the winner of each country then competes against the other finalists in the grand finale at Wacken Open Air.

An international jury selects the competition&#x27;s best bands. In earlier years, winners of the competition were offered a record deal, whereas nowadays, the five best bands receive cash or material prizes.

=== Wacken Foundation ===
The Wacken Foundation was founded in 2009 by the festival&#x27;s organisers and serves as a charitable foundation. Its objective is to support young bands from the Heavy Metal genre.

Sponsorship is granted to specific projects such as the production of a CD or the realisation of a tour. In addition, the Wacken Foundation provides information about its projects at many European festivals each summer. Since the 2017/2018 season, the Wacken Foundation&#x27;s lettering can be found on the jerseys of German 3rd league club FC Carl Zeiss Jena. This was facilitated by jersey sponsors Heaven Shall Burn, whose logo has been moved to the jersey&#x27;s sleeve for this cause. Part of the proceeds from the jersey&#x27;s sale is donated to the foundation.

=== Wacken Music Camp ===
2014 saw Wacken Music Camp take place for the first time. One week after the festival ended, young people from all over Germany were invited to write and play their own songs under the guidance of professional musicians. They were accommodated in the so-called Kuhle, the site of the first Wacken Open Air.

=== Blood donations ===
The organisers regularly call for blood donations with the whole festival team. Blood is donated at the Itzehoe Clinic and the entire wing is decorated in W:O:A style, while Heavy Metal is blasted through the speakers.

=== DKMS typing campaign ===
Since W:O:A 2014, visitors and musicians have been encouraged to have their bone marrow typed for donation by the German Bone Marrow Donor Database. In 2014, 2,700 visitors took this opportunity.

=== Stark gegen Krebs – Strong against cancer ===
The festival works with the organisers of the so-called Wattolümpiade (&quot;mudflat Olympics&quot;) in Brunsbüttel to promote the slogan Stark gegen Krebs (&quot;Strong against cancer&quot;). The festival&#x27;s team helps out with logistics for the event.

== Network ==

In addition to the festival itself, there are numerous other events planned and carried out by the organisers. A wide range of merchandising has also been developed over the years. In addition to T-shirts and a comprehensive range of CDs and DVDs, the festival also has accompanying print media. The &quot;W:O:A History Book&quot; contains the open-air&#x27;s history up until 2005. The book Die Wahrheit über Wacken (&quot;The truth about Wacken&quot;, Oidium Verlag 2005, new edition published at Verlag Andreas Reiffer 2011) provides a more humorous account of the festival. It was written by satirist Till Burgwächter in collaboration with comic artist Jan Oidium and is also available as an audio book comprising three CDs. The publication of a Metal cookbook shows how far merchandising has come. However, the mounting range of merchandising has led to growing criticism, as some consider it to be purely profit-oriented. The increasing coverage of the festival, especially in the wake of the documentary Full Metal Village, is perceived by the traditional Metal scene as &quot;selling out&quot;.

In 2005, Wacken Premium Pilsner was offered as the festival&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; beer for the first time. It was produced in the Bavarian brewery Maximiliansbrauerei in Chieming. At W:O:A 2006 and 2007, the beer was available as well, this time produced in 0.5-litre bottles by the Flensburger brewery. The large number of glass shards later forced the organisers to switch to 0.5-litre cans.

As a motto, the phrase &quot;See you in Wacken - Rain or Shine&quot; has established itself alongside &quot;Faster, Harder, Louder&quot;. Additionally, the festival features the sentence &quot;Louder Than Hell&quot; in its advertising.

=== Full Metal Cruise ===
Cruises with Heavy Metal bands on board under the name Full Metal Cruise have been organised within Europe since 2013.

=== Hamburg Metal Dayz ===
The indoor festival Hamburg Metal Dayz takes place at the same time as the Reeperbahn-Festival and is considered a get-together for the scene. In addition to concerts, there are panels with musicians, managers, and other Metal experts, as well as workshops and a question and answer session with the W:O:A organisers.

=== Wacken Roadshow ===

For the Wacken Roadshow, several bands tour Europe under the banner of Wacken Open Air. These concerts are meant to complement the warm-up parties organised in many places.

=== Metal Monday ===
In the summer of 1990, Metal Monday took place for the first time at Knust in Hamburg. For five years, regional, national and international Metal bands like De la Cruz, 5th Avenue, and King Køng played at Knust every Monday. After a break of almost 20 years, Metal Monday was revived by the Wacken Open Air organisers in 2014 in cooperation with the Knust, Seaside Touring, All Access, and Hamburg Konzerte. Metal, Rock, and Folkrock bands now perform once a month, following the motto &quot;three bands - small entrance fee&quot;. In addition to regional bands, international newcomers are always invited.

=== Zum Wackinger ===

The former country-style restaurant &quot;Zur Post&quot; in Wacken, built in 1919, has been the hub of the village and the surrounding communities for decades. It was here that bartenders Thomas Jensen and Holger Hübner conceived the idea for today&#x27;s Wacken Open Air. Today, it is used to accommodate staff and to serve other business purposes. A series of events called &quot;Zum Wackinger&quot; sees artists from music, comedy, and entertainment perform regularly. Since 2016, a two-day medieval feast with jugglers and bards takes place here.

=== Metal Church ===
The Evangelical Lutheran Village Church in Wacken belongs to the Lutheran congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany. For Wacken Open Air and Wacken Winter Nights, it is turned into the &quot;Metal Church&quot;. During said festivals, the &quot;Metal Service&quot; is held here and bands from the Folk and Medieval scene perform in the church.

=== Wacken Winter Nights ===

Wacken Winter Nights (WWN), a three-day Folk and Medieval open-air festival, took place for the first time in February 2017 at temperatures of -2 to -6 degrees Celsius in Wacken. With over 3,500 attendees, the festival&#x27;s first edition sold out several weeks in advance. Most of them spent the nights on the camping site. A second edition took place from 23 to 25 February 2018. Due to the construction on the previous year&#x27;s campground, the overnight accommodations were relocated to the area that is also used for the regular Open Air. The walking distance, therefore, increased to about 15 minutes. With 4,000 visitors, the 2018 event also sold out. For the third event in 2019, the festival grounds were expanded considerably and 5,000 visitors attended. The fourth WWNs are planned for the 14th to 16 February 2020. 
=== StrongmanRun ===
The Fisherman&#x27;s Friend StrongmanRun visited the Metal festival grounds of Wacken for the first time in April 2016. With their Wacken debut, the StrongmanRun season formally kicked off. About 3,000 participants, some in colourful costumes, took part in the run on the 20 km track with 40 obstacles. In 2017, the StrongmanRun took place on the festival grounds.

=== Wacken Rocks ===
Several open-air festivals called Wacken Rocks were held in the past to transport the Wacken atmosphere to other places.

=== Full Metal Mountain ===

During the winters of 2016, 2017 and 2018, an annual ski trip to Nassfeld, Austria was organised for Metal fans under the name &quot;Full Metal Mountain&quot;. Numerous bands and artists were present. For 2019, the festival was cancelled entirely.

=== Full Metal Holiday ===
Planning and preparation are underway for a holiday trip to Mallorca with the title &quot;Full Metal Holiday - Destination Mallorca&quot;, which will offer Metal concerts on the beach from 12 to 19 October 2020. The event was originally planned for 2017 and said to head to Ibiza, then rescheduled for 2018 and changed to Mallorca.

== W:O:A in numbers ==
The following chart shows the development of prices and visitor numbers of past festivals as published by the organisers. Prices refer to the total amount per ticket (incl. parking and camping) in pre-sale (without additional fees). The price for the 4-day 2023 edition (299.00 EUR) has been adjusted accordingly. 
== Documentaries and reception   ==

Since 1999, various documentaries about W:O:A have been made. The first documentary, Metalheads - The Official Documentary, was produced in 1999 on the occasion of the festival&#x27;s 10th anniversary and was released on VHS by Rock Hard in 2000. The film team lived on the festival grounds for ten days prior to the actual start of the festival and documented the work of construction workers, farmers such as Uwe Trede, villagers, fans and organisers. Although the film shows excerpts from performances by some of the bands and interviews with the artists, it is more of a behind-the-scenes documentary. The film was produced with the simplest means, including a professional Hi8 and a Mini-DV camera and a team of three, and was regarded by the organisers as a trial run on the subject of film. According to the organisers, a total of 10,000 copies were made and sold. The film &quot;Nordland&quot; was shot for the 15th edition of W:O:A, but was only used for internal promotion. Both films were made by Thomas Greiner.

The documentary &quot;&quot; by Sam Dunn (2005) features Wacken Open Air. The festival is described as a Mecca of Heavy Metal. The film &quot;Full Metal Village&quot; by director Cho Sung-Hyung, made in 2005 and 2006, portrays the people of Wacken dealing with the festival. In 2006, she was awarded the main award of the Hessischer Filmpreis and the Schleswig-Holstein Filmpreis for best documentary. Full Metal Village was the first documentary ever to win the Max Ophüls Award for young filmmakers in 2007. WDR-Rockpalast profiled the festival in 2006, 2007, and 2009 with two-hour documentaries. Broadcaster DMAX also sent a camera team and produced a one-hour documentary on the construction of W:O:A in 2007.

ZDF television filmed the 30-minute feature &quot;Ein Dorf und 100.000 Rockfans&quot; about Wacken Open Air 2008.

The aforementioned projects are almost identical in content; they invite visitors, organisers, and the citizens of Wacken to comment on the festival and generally present it in a positive way. However, there has been criticism of the fact that the Wacken Firefighters have been featured too prominently. The three Rockpalast documentaries focus on interviews with the musicians and the performances of the bands.

Another perspective is offered by the low-budget production &quot;Metaller die auf Brüste starren&quot; (&quot;The Metalheads Who Stare At Breasts&quot;, title based on The Men Who Stare At Goats), which five festival attendees shot during their stay at Wacken. &quot;Offener Kanal Bad Offenbach&quot; is listed as its official producer. The film shows the festival from the filmmakers&#x27; (subjective) point of view and comments on the events in the style of New Journalism. In contrast to other documentaries, this one focuses on the fans. Whether it&#x27;s a documentary in the true sense of the word or whether the film is just entertainment remains controversial. The filmmakers themselves avoid this question and classify their work as a &quot;trash documentary&quot;. The film premiered on 5 May 2011.

Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s Prime Minister Peter Harry Carstensen (CDU) commented on the opening of W:O:A 2009: &quot;I don&#x27;t come here to listen to the music, but I do identify with the festival&quot;.

Selected concerts of Wacken Open Air 2014 were broadcast live in an online stream. Furthermore, the cooperation between Spiegel Online and Arte made some performances available as video on demand.

To mark its 30th anniversary, the Norddeutsche Rundschau published a special edition that offered insights into the organisation of the Wacken Open Air. In addition, there will be a special exhibition at the Prinzesshof Kreismuseum in Itzehoe to mark the anniversary.

=== Awards ===

At an awards ceremony on 11 March 2008, W:O:A received the Live Entertainment Award (LEA) for best festival of 2007.

==== TV Series &#x27;Legend of Wacken&#x27;====
On 12 July 2023 the broadcaster RTL+ started airing the first season of six episodes of the mini series Legend of Wacken - 
The plot is about the struggle of the founders to kick off their festival idea with comedy and satiric style. When Holger is nearly electrocuted by a live wire he (in a coma) and his co-organizer Thomas reflect on their creation, the Wacken Open Air Heavy Metal Festival that in 1990 had an audience of 800 and now attracts 100,000 fans per year. The cast of the founders: Sammy Scheuritzel as young Holger Hübner, Charly Hübner as older Holger Hübner, Sebastian Jakob Doppelbauer as young Thomas Jansen and Aurel Manthei as older Thomas Jansen. It is not an accurate documentary series and has a huge part of fiction.

==== Further reception ====
In her crime novels Tod in Wacken and Der Teufel von Wacken, author Heike Denzau places her storylines at Wacken Open Air, describing the location as well as the festival and its visitors.

<doc id="571618" wikidata="Q1089649" url="?curid=571618" title="Stanislavski's system">
<text>Stanislavski&#x27;s system is a systematic approach to training actors that the Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski developed in the first half of the twentieth century. His system cultivates what he calls the &quot;art of experiencing&quot; (with which he contrasts the &quot;art of representation&quot;). It mobilises the actor&#x27;s conscious thought and will in order to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes—such as emotional experience and subconscious behaviour—sympathetically and indirectly. In rehearsal, the actor searches for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the character seeks to achieve at any given moment (a &quot;task&quot;).

Later, Stanislavski further elaborated what he called &#x27;the System&#x27; with a more physically grounded rehearsal process that came to be known as the &quot;Method of Physical Action&quot;. Minimising at-the-table discussions, he now encouraged an &quot;active representative&quot;, in which the sequence of dramatic situations are improvised. &quot;The best analysis of a play&quot;, Stanislavski argued, &quot;is to take action in the given circumstances.&quot;

Thanks to its promotion and development by acting teachers who were former students and the many translations of Stanislavski&#x27;s theoretical writings, his system acquired an unprecedented ability to cross cultural boundaries and developed a reach, dominating debates about acting in the West. According to one writer on twentieth-century theatre in London and New York, Stanislavski’s ideas have become accepted as common sense so that actors may use them without knowing that they do.

==Stanislavski before his system==
Having worked as an amateur actor and director until the age of 33, in 1898 Stanislavski co-founded with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) and began his professional career. The two of them were resolved to institute a revolution in the staging practices of the time. Benedetti offers a vivid portrait of the poor quality of mainstream theatrical practice in Russia before the MAT:The script meant less than nothing. Sometimes the cast did not even bother to learn their lines. Leading actors would simply plant themselves downstage centre, by the prompter&#x27;s box, wait to be fed the lines then deliver them straight at the audience in a ringing voice, giving a fine display of passion and &quot;temperament.&quot; Everyone, in fact, spoke their lines out front. Direct communication with the other actors was minimal. Furniture was so arranged as to allow the actors to face front.

Stanislavski&#x27;s early productions were created without the use of his system. His first international successes were staged using an external, director-centred technique that strove for an organic unity of all its elements—in each production he planned the interpretation of every role, blocking, and the &quot;mise en scène&quot; in detail in advance. He also introduced into the production process a period of discussion and detailed analysis of the play by the cast. Despite the success that this approach brought, particularly with his Naturalistic stagings of the plays of Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky, Stanislavski remained dissatisfied.

Both his struggles with Chekhov&#x27;s drama (out of which his notion of subtext emerged) and his experiments with Symbolism encouraged a greater attention to &quot;inner action&quot; and a more intensive investigation of the actor&#x27;s process. He began to develop the more actor-centred techniques of &quot;psychological realism&quot; and his focus shifted from his productions to rehearsal process and pedagogy. He pioneered the use of theatre studios as a laboratory in which to innovate actor training and to experiment with new forms of theatre.

Throughout his career, Stanislavski subjected his acting and direction to a rigorous process of artistic self-analysis and reflection. His system of acting developed out of his persistent efforts to remove the blocks that he encountered in his performances, beginning with a major crisis in 1906.

Stanislavski eventually came to organise his techniques into a coherent, systematic methodology, which built on three major strands of influence: (1) the director-centred, unified aesthetic and disciplined, ensemble approach of the Meiningen company; (2) the actor-centred realism of the Maly; and (3) the Naturalistic staging of Antoine and the independent theatre movement. Stanislavski&#x27;s earliest reference to his system appears in 1909, the same year that he first incorporated it into his rehearsal process. Olga Knipper and many of the other MAT actors in that production—Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s comedy &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;—resented Stanislavski&#x27;s use of it as a laboratory in which to conduct his experiments. At Stanislavski&#x27;s insistence, the MAT went on to adopt his system as its official rehearsal method in 1911.

==Experiencing the role==

This system is based on &quot;experiencing a role.&quot; This principle demands that as an actor, you should &quot;experience feelings analogous&quot; to those that the character experiences &quot;each and every time you do it.&quot; Stanislavski approvingly quotes Tommaso Salvini when he insists that actors should really feel what they portray &quot;at every performance, be it the first or the thousandth.&quot;

Not all emotional experiences are appropriate, therefore, since the actor&#x27;s feelings must be relevant and parallel to the character&#x27;s experience. Stanislavski identified Salvini, whose performance of Othello he had admired in 1882, as the finest representative of the art of experiencing approach. Salvini had disagreed with the French actor Cocquelin over the role emotion ought to play—whether it should be experienced only in rehearsals when preparing the role (Cocquelin&#x27;s position) or whether it ought to be felt in performance (Salvini&#x27;s position).

On this basis, Stanislavski contrasts his own &quot;art of experiencing&quot; approach with what he calls the &quot;art of representation&quot; practised by Cocquelin (in which experiencing forms one of the preparatory stages only) and &quot;hack&quot; acting (in which experiencing plays no part). Stanislavski defines the actor&#x27;s &quot;experiencing&quot; as playing &quot;credibly&quot;, by which he means &quot;thinking, wanting, striving, behaving truthfully, in logical sequence in a human way, within the character, and in complete parallel to it&quot;, such that the actor begins to feel &quot;as one with&quot; the role.
Stanislavski&#x27;s approach seeks to stimulate the will to create afresh and to activate subconscious processes sympathetically and indirectly by means of conscious techniques. In this way, it attempts to recreate in the actor the inner, psychological causes of behaviour, rather than to present a simulacrum of their effects. Stanislavski recognised that in practice a performance is usually a mixture of the three trends (experiencing, representation, hack) but felt that experiencing should predominate.

The range of training exercises and rehearsal practices that are designed to encourage and support &quot;experiencing the role&quot; resulted from many years of sustained inquiry and experiment. Many may be discerned as early as 1905 in Stanislavski&#x27;s letter of advice to Vera Kotlyarevskaya on how to approach the role of Charlotta in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;:
First of all you must live the role without spoiling the words or making them commonplace. Shut yourself off and play whatever goes through your head. Imagine the following scene: Pishchik has proposed to Charlotta, now she is his bride... How will she behave? Or: Charlotta has been dismissed but finds other employment in a circus of a café-chantant. How does she do gymnastics or sing little songs? Do your hair in various ways and try to find in yourself things which remind you of Charlotta. You will be reduced to despair twenty times in your search but don&#x27;t give up. Make this German woman you love so much speak Russian and observe how she pronounces words and what are the special characteristics of her speech. Remember to play Charlotta in a dramatic moment of her life. Try to make her weep sincerely over her life. Through such an image you will discover all the whole range of notes you need.

Exercises such as these, though never seen directly onstage or screen, prepare the actor for a performance based on experiencing the role. Experiencing constitutes the inner, psychological aspect of a role, which is endowed with the actor&#x27;s individual feelings and own personality. Stanislavski argues that this creation of an inner life should be the actor&#x27;s first concern. He groups together the training exercises intended to support the emergence of experiencing under the general term &quot;psychotechnique&quot;.

==Given circumstances and the Magic If==

Stanislavski&#x27;s &quot;Magic If&quot; describes an ability to imagine oneself in a set of fictional circumstances and to envision the consequences of finding oneself facing that situation in terms of action. These circumstances are &quot;given&quot; to the actor principally by the playwright or screenwriter, though they also include choices made by the director, designers, and other actors. The ensemble of these circumstances that the actor is required to incorporate into a performance are called the &quot;given circumstances&quot;. &quot;It is easy,&quot; Carnicke warns, &quot;to misunderstand this notion as a directive to play oneself.&quot; A human being&#x27;s circumstances condition his or her character, this approach assumes. &quot;Placing oneself in the role does not mean transferring one&#x27;s own circumstances to the play, but rather incorporating into oneself circumstances other than one&#x27;s own.&quot;

In preparation and rehearsal, the actor develops imaginary stimuli, which often consist of sensory details of the circumstances, in order to provoke an organic, subconscious response in performance. These &quot;inner objects of attention&quot; (often abbreviated to &quot;inner objects&quot; or &quot;contacts&quot;) help to support the emergence of an &quot;unbroken line&quot; of experiencing through a performance, which constitutes the inner life of the role. An &quot;unbroken line&quot; describes the actor&#x27;s ability to focus attention exclusively on the fictional world of the drama throughout a performance, rather than becoming distracted by the scrutiny of the audience, the presence of a camera crew, or concerns relating to the actor&#x27;s experience in the real world offstage or outside the world of the drama. In a rehearsal process, at first, the &quot;line&quot; of experiencing will be patchy and broken; as preparation and rehearsals develop, it becomes increasingly sustained and unbroken. 
When experiencing the role, the actor is fully absorbed by the drama and immersed in its fictional circumstances; it is a state that the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls &quot;flow.&quot; Stanislavski used the term &quot;I am being&quot; to describe it. He encouraged this absorption through the cultivation of &quot;public solitude&quot; and its &quot;circles of attention&quot; in training and rehearsal, which he developed from the meditation techniques of yoga. Stanislavski did not encourage complete identification with the role, however, since a genuine belief that one had become someone else would be pathological.

==Tasks and action==
An actor&#x27;s performance is animated by the pursuit of a sequence of &quot;tasks&quot; (identified in Elizabeth Hapgood&#x27;s original English translation as &quot;objectives&quot;). A task is a problem, embedded in the &quot;given circumstances&quot; of a scene, that the character needs to solve. This is often framed as a question: &quot;What do I need to make the other person &quot;do&quot;?&quot; or &quot;What do I want?&quot;

In preparing and rehearsing for a role, actors break up their parts into a series of discrete &quot;bits&quot;, each of which is distinguished by the dramatic event of a &quot;reversal point&quot;, when a major revelation, decision, or realisation alters the direction of the action in a significant way. (Each &quot;bit&quot; or &quot;beat&quot; corresponds to the length of a single motivation [task or objective]. The term &quot;bit&quot; is often mistranslated in the US as &quot;beat&quot;, as a result of its pronunciation in a heavy Russian accent by Stanislavski&#x27;s students who taught his system there.)

A task must be engaging and stimulating imaginatively to the actor, Stanislavski argues, such that it compels action:
One of the most important creative principles is that an actor&#x27;s tasks must always be able to coax his feelings, will and intelligence, so that they become part of him, since only they have creative power. [...] The task must provide the means to arouse creative enthusiasm. Like a magnet, it must have great drawing power and must then stimulate endeavours, movements and actions. &quot;The task is the spur to creative activity, its motivation. The task is a decoy for feeling.&quot; [...] The task sparks off wishes and inner impulses (spurs) toward creative effort. The task creates the inner sources which are transformed naturally and logically into action. The task is the heart of the bit, that makes the pulse of the living organism, the role, beat.

Stanislavski&#x27;s production of &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (1909) was a watershed in his artistic development, constituting, according to Magarshack, &quot;the first play he produced according to his system.&quot; Breaking the MAT&#x27;s tradition of open rehearsals, he prepared Turgenev&#x27;s play in private. The cast began with a discussion of what Stanislavski would come to call the &quot;through-line&quot; for the characters (their emotional development and the way they change over the course of the play). This production is the earliest recorded instance of his practice of analysing the action of the script into discrete &quot;bits&quot;.

The pursuit of one task after another forms a through-line of action, which unites the discrete bits into an unbroken continuum of experience. This through-line drives towards a task operating at the scale of the drama as a whole and is called, for that reason, a &quot;supertask&quot; (or &quot;superobjective&quot;). A performance consists of the inner aspects of a role (experiencing) and its outer aspects (&quot;embodiment&quot;) that are united in the pursuit of the supertask.

In his later work, Stanislavski focused more intently on the underlying patterns of dramatic conflict. He developed a rehearsal technique that he called &quot;active analysis&quot; in which actors would improvise these conflictual dynamics. In the American developments of Stanislavski&#x27;s system—such as that found in Uta Hagen&#x27;s &quot;Respect for Acting&quot;, for example—the forces opposing a characters&#x27; pursuit of their tasks are called &quot;obstacles&quot;.

==Method of Physical Action==

Stanislavski further elaborated his system with a more physically grounded rehearsal process that came to be known after his death as the &quot;Method of Physical Action&quot;. Stanislavski had developed it since 1916, he first explored it practically in the early 1930s. The roots of the Method of Physical Action stretch back to Stanislavski&#x27;s earliest work as a director (in which he focused consistently on a play&#x27;s action) and the techniques he explored with Vsevolod Meyerhold and later with the First Studio of the MAT before the First World War (such as the experiments with improvisation and the practice of anatomising scripts in terms of bits and tasks).

Benedetti emphasises the continuity of the Method of Physical Action with Stanislavski&#x27;s earlier approaches; Whyman argues that &quot;there is no justification in Stanislavsky&#x27;s [&quot;sic&quot;] writings for the assertion that the &quot;method of physical actions&quot; represents a rejection of his previous work&quot;. Stanislavski first explored the approach practically in his rehearsals for &quot;Three Sisters&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot; in 1934 and &quot;Molière&quot; in 1935.

Minimising at-the-table discussions, he now encouraged an &quot;active analysis&quot;, in which the sequence of dramatic situations are improvised. &quot;The best analysis of a play&quot;, Stanislavski argued, &quot;is to take action in the given circumstances.&quot; He continues:
For in the process of action the actor gradually obtains the mastery over the inner incentives of the actions of the character he is representing, evoking in himself the emotions and thoughts which resulted in those actions. In such a case, an actor not only understands his part, but also feels it, and that is the most important thing in creative work on the stage.

Just as the First Studio, led by his assistant and close friend Leopold Sulerzhitsky, had provided the forum in which he developed his initial ideas for his system during the 1910s, he hoped to secure his final legacy by opening another studio in 1935, in which the Method of Physical Action would be taught. The Opera-Dramatic Studio embodied the most complete implementation of the training exercises described in his manuals. Meanwhile, the transmission of his earlier work via the students of the First Studio was revolutionising acting in the West. With the arrival of Socialist realism in the USSR, the MAT and Stanislavski&#x27;s system were enthroned as exemplary models.

Many actors routinely equate his system with the American Method, although the latter&#x27;s exclusively psychological techniques contrast sharply with the multivariant, holistic and psychophysical approach of the &quot;system&quot;, which explores character and action both from the &#x27;inside out&#x27; and the &#x27;outside in&#x27; and treats the actor&#x27;s mind and body as parts of a continuum. In response to his characterisation work on Argan in Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot; in 1913, Stanislavski concluded that &quot;a character is sometimes formed psychologically, i.e. from the inner image of the role, but at other times it is discovered through purely external exploration.&quot; In fact Stanislavski found that many of his students who were &quot;method acting&quot; were having many mental problems, and instead encouraged his students to shake off the character after rehearsing.

==Theatre studios and the development of Stanislavski&#x27;s system==

===First Studio===
The First Studio of the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) was a theatre studio that Stanislavski created in 1898 in order to research and develop his system. It was conceived as a space in which pedagogical and exploratory work could be undertaken in isolation from the public, in order to develop new forms and techniques. Stanislavski later defined a theatre studio as &quot;neither a theatre nor a dramatic school for beginners, but a laboratory for the experiments of more or less trained actors.&quot; The First Studio&#x27;s founding members included Yevgeny Vakhtangov, Michael Chekhov, Richard Boleslavsky, and Maria Ouspenskaya, all of whom would exert a considerable influence on the subsequent history of theatre.

Leopold Sulerzhitsky, who had been Stanislavski&#x27;s personal assistant since 1905 and whom Maxim Gorky had nicknamed &quot;Suler&quot;, was selected to lead the studio. In a focused, intense atmosphere, its work emphasised experimentation, improvisation, and self-discovery. Until his death in 1938, Suler taught the elements of Stanislavski&#x27;s system in its germinal form: relaxation, concentration of attention, imagination, communication, and emotion memory. On becoming independent from the MAT in 1923, the company re-named itself the Second Moscow Art Theatre, though Stanislavski came to regard it as a betrayal of his principles.

===Opera Studio===

Benedetti argues that a significant influence on the development of Stanislavski&#x27;s system came from his experience teaching and directing at his Opera Studio. He created it in 1918 under the auspices of the Bolshoi Theatre, though it later severed its connection with the theatre. Stanislavski worked with his Opera Studio in the two rehearsal rooms of his house on Carriage Row (prior to his eviction in March 1921). His brother and sister, Vladimir and Zinaïda, ran the studio and also taught there. It accepted young members of the Bolshoi and students from the Moscow Conservatory. Stanislavski also invited Serge Wolkonsky to teach diction and Lev Pospekhin (from the Bolshoi Ballet) to teach expressive movement and dance.

By means of his system, Stanislavski aimed to unite the work of Mikhail Shchepkin and Feodor Chaliapin. He hoped that the successful application of his system to opera, with its inescapable conventionality, would demonstrate the universality of his methodology. From his experience at the Opera Studio he developed his notion of &quot;tempo-rhythm&quot;, which he was to develop most substantially in part two of &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot; (1938).

A series of thirty-two lectures that he delivered to this studio between 1919 and 1922 were recorded by Konkordia Antarova and published in 1939; they have been translated into English as &quot;On the Art of the Stage&quot; (1950). Pavel Rumiantsev—who joined the studio in 1920 from the Conservatory and sang the title role in its production of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; in 1922—documented its activities until 1932; his notes were published in 1969 and appear in English under the title &quot;Stanislavski on Opera&quot; (1975).

===Opera—Dramatic Studio===
Near the end of his life Stanislavski created an Opera—Dramatic Studio in his own apartment on Leontievski Lane (now known as &quot;Stanislavski Lane&quot;), under the auspices of which between 1935 and 1938 he offered a significant course in the system in its final form.

Given the difficulties he had with completing his manual for actors, in 1935 while recuperating in Nice Stanislavski decided that he needed to found a new studio if he was to ensure his legacy. &quot;Our school will produce not just individuals,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but a whole company.&quot; In June he began to instruct a group of teachers in the training techniques of the &#x27;system&#x27; and the rehearsal processes of the Method of Physical Action. The teachers had some previous experience studying the system as private students of Stanislavski&#x27;s sister, Zinaïda. His wife, Lilina, also joined the teaching staff. Twenty students (out of 3500 who had auditioned) were accepted for the dramatic section of the Opera—Dramatic Studio, where classes began on 15 November 1935. Its members included the future artistic director of the MAT, Mikhail Kedrov, who played Tartuffe in Stanislavski&#x27;s unfinished production of Molière&#x27;s play (which, after Stanislavski&#x27;s death, he completed).

Jean Benedetti argues that the course at the Opera—Dramatic Studio is &quot;Stanislavski&#x27;s true testament.&quot; Stanislavski arranged a curriculum of four years of study that focused exclusively on technique and method—two years of the work detailed later in &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work on Himself&quot; and two of that in &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work on a Role&quot;. Once the students were acquainted with the training techniques of the first two years, Stanislavski selected &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for their work on roles. He &quot;insisted that they work on classics, because, &#x27;in any work of genius you find an ideal logic and progression.&#x27;&quot; He worked with the students in March and April 1937, focusing on their sequences of physical actions, on establishing their through-lines of action, and on rehearsing scenes anew in terms of the actors&#x27; tasks. &quot;They must avoid at all costs,&quot; Benedetti explains, &quot;merely repeating the externals of what they had done the day before.&quot;

==Heritage==
Many of Stanislavski&#x27;s former students taught acting in the United States, including Richard Boleslavsky, Maria Ouspenskaya, Michael Chekhov, Andrius Jilinsky, Leo Bulgakov, Varvara Bulgakov, Vera Solovyova, and Tamara Daykarhanova. Others—including Stella Adler and Joshua Logan—&quot;grounded careers in brief periods of study&quot; with him. Boleslavsky and Ouspenskaya went on to found the influential American Laboratory Theatre (1923—1933) in New York, which they modeled on the First Studio. Boleslavsky&#x27;s manual &quot;Acting: The First Six Lessons&quot; (1933) played a significant role in the transmission of Stanislavski&#x27;s ideas and practices to the West. In the Soviet Union, meanwhile, another of Stanislavski&#x27;s students, Maria Knebel, sustained and developed his rehearsal process of &quot;active analysis&quot;, despite its formal prohibition by the state.

In the United States, one of Boleslavsky&#x27;s students, Lee Strasberg, went on to co-found the Group Theatre (1931—1940) in New York with Harold Clurman and Cheryl Crawford. Together with Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner, Strasberg developed the earliest of Stanislavski&#x27;s techniques into what came to be known as &quot;Method acting&quot; (or, with Strasberg, more usually simply &quot;the Method&quot;), which he taught at the Actors Studio. Boleslavsky thought that Strasberg over-emphasised the role of Stanislavski&#x27;s technique of &quot;emotion memory&quot; at the expense of dramatic action.

Every afternoon for five weeks during the summer of 1934 in Paris, Stanislavski worked with Adler, who had sought his assistance with the blocks she had confronted in her performances. Given the emphasis that emotion memory had received in New York, Adler was surprised to find that Stanislavski rejected the technique except as a last resort. He recommended an indirect pathway to emotional expression via physical action. Stanislavski confirmed this emphasis in his discussions with Harold Clurman in late 1935. The news that this was Stanislavski&#x27;s approach would have significant repercussions in the US; Strasberg angrily rejected it and refused to modify his approach. Adler&#x27;s most famous student was actor Marlon Brando. Later, many American and British actors inspired by Brando were also adepts of Stanislavski teachings, including James Dean, Julie Harris, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Dustin Hoffman, Ellen Burstyn, Daniel Day-Lewis and Marilyn Monroe.

Meisner, an actor at the Group Theatre, went on to teach method acting at New York&#x27;s Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, where he developed an emphasis on what Stanislavski called &quot;communication&quot; and &quot;adaptation&quot; in an approach that he branded the &quot;Meisner technique&quot;. Among the actors trained in the Meisner technique are Robert Duvall, Tom Cruise, Diane Keaton and Sydney Pollack.

Though many others have contributed to the development of method acting, Strasberg, Adler, and Meisner are associated with &quot;having set the standard of its success&quot;, though each emphasised different aspects: Strasberg developed the psychological aspects, Adler, the sociological, and Meisner, the behavioral. While each strand of the American tradition vigorously sought to distinguish itself from the others, they all share a basic set of assumptions that allows them to be grouped together.

The relations between these strands and their acolytes, Carnicke argues, have been characterised by a &quot;seemingly endless hostility among warring camps, each proclaiming themselves his only true disciples, like religious fanatics, turning dynamic ideas into rigid dogma.&quot; Stanislavski&#x27;s Method of Physical Action formed the central part of Sonia Moore&#x27;s attempts to revise the general impression of Stanislavski&#x27;s system arising from the American Laboratory Theatre and its teachers.

Carnicke analyses at length the splintering of the system into its psychological and physical components, both in the US and the USSR. She argues instead for its psychophysical integration. She suggests that Moore&#x27;s approach, for example, accepts uncritically the teleological accounts of Stanislavski&#x27;s work (according to which early experiments in emotion memory were &#x27;abandoned&#x27; and the approach &#x27;reversed&#x27; with a discovery of the scientific approach of behaviourism). These accounts, which emphasised the physical aspects at the expense of the psychological, revised the system in order to render it more palatable to the dialectical materialism of the Soviet state. In a similar way, other American accounts re-interpreted Stanislavski&#x27;s work in terms of the prevailing popular interest in Freudian psychoanalysis. Strasberg, for example, dismissed the &quot;Method of Physical Action&quot; as a step backwards. Just as an emphasis on action had characterised Stanislavski&#x27;s First Studio training, so emotion memory continued to be an element of his system at the end of his life, when he recommended to his directing students:
One must give actors various paths. One of these is the path of action. There is also another path: you can move from feeling to action, arousing feeling first. 
&quot;Action, &#x27;if&#x27;, and &#x27;given circumstances&#x27;&quot;, &quot;emotion memory&quot;, &quot;imagination&quot;, and &quot;communication&quot; all appear as chapters in Stanislavski&#x27;s manual &quot;An Actor&#x27;s Work&quot; (1938) and all were elements of the systematic whole of his approach, which resists easy schematisation.

Stanislavski&#x27;s work made little impact on British theatre before the 1960s. Joan Littlewood and Ewan MacColl were the first to introduce Stanislavski&#x27;s techniques there. In their Theatre Workshop, the experimental studio that they founded together, Littlewood used improvisation as a means to explore character and situation and insisted that her actors define their character&#x27;s behaviour in terms of a sequence of tasks. The actor Michael Redgrave was also an early advocate of Stanislavski&#x27;s approach in Britain. The first drama school in the country to teach an approach to acting based on Stanislavski&#x27;s system and its American derivatives was Drama Centre London, where it is still taught today.

Many other theatre practitioners have been influenced by Stanislavski&#x27;s ideas and practices. Jerzy Grotowski regarded Stanislavski as the primary influence on his own theatre work.

==Criticism of Stanislavski&#x27;s theories==

Mikhail Bulgakov, writing in the manner of a &quot;roman à clef&quot;, includes in his novel &quot;Black Snow (Театральный роман)&quot; satires of Stanislavski&#x27;s methods and theories. In the novel, the stage director, Ivan Vasilyevich, uses acting exercises while directing a play, which is titled &quot;Black Snow&quot;. The playwright in the novel sees the acting exercises taking over the rehearsals, becoming madcap, and causing the playwright to rewrite parts of his play. The playwright is concerned that his script is being lost in all of this. When he finally sees the play performed, the playwright reflects that the director&#x27;s theories would ultimately lead the audience to become so absorbed in the reality of the performances that they forget the play. Bulgakov had the actual experience, in 1926, of having a play that he had written, &quot;The White Guard&quot;, directed with great success by Stanislavski at the Moscow Arts Theatre.

<doc id="571621" wikidata="Q528918" url="?curid=571621" title="Grumman X-29">
<text>The Grumman X-29 is an American experimental aircraft that tested a forward-swept wing, canard control surfaces, and other novel aircraft technologies. Funded by NASA, the United States Air Force and DARPA, the X-29 was developed by Grumman, and the two built were flown by NASA and the United States Air Force. The aerodynamic instability of the X-29&#x27;s airframe required the use of computerized fly-by-wire control. Composite materials were used to control the aeroelastic divergent twisting experienced by forward-swept wings, and to reduce weight. The aircraft first flew in 1984, and two X-29s were flight tested through 1991.

==Design and development==
Two X-29As were built by Grumman after the proposal had been chosen over a competing one involving a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The X-29 design made use of the forward fuselage and nose landing gear from two existing F-5A Freedom Fighter airframes (63-8372 became 82-0003 and 65-10573 became 82-0049). The control surface actuators and main landing gear were from the F-16. The technological advancement that made the X-29 a plausible design was the use of carbon-fiber composites. The wings of the X-29, made partially of graphite epoxy, were swept forward at more than 33 degrees; forward-swept wings were first trialed 40 years earlier on the experimental Junkers Ju 287 and OKB-1 EF 131. The Grumman internal designation for the X-29 was &quot;Grumman Model 712&quot; or &quot;G-712&quot;.

===Three-surface design and inherent instability===
The X-29 is described as a three surface aircraft, with canards, forward-swept wings, and aft strake control surfaces, using three-surface longitudinal control. The canards and wings result in reduced trim drag and reduced wave drag, while using the strakes for trim in situations where the center of gravity is off provides less trim drag than relying on the canard to compensate.

The configuration, combined with a center of gravity well aft of the aerodynamic center, made the craft inherently unstable. Stability was provided by the computerized flight control system making 40 corrections per second. The flight control system was made up of three redundant digital computers backed up by three redundant analog computers; any of the three could fly it on its own, but the redundancy allowed them to check for errors. Each of the three would &quot;vote&quot; on their measurements, so that if any one was malfunctioning it could be detected. It was estimated that a total failure of the system was as unlikely as a mechanical failure in an airplane with a conventional arrangement. If all of the flight computers failed mid-flight, the aircraft would have disintegrated due to aeroelastic forces before the pilot could keep it stable or even eject.

The high pitch instability of the airframe led to wide predictions of extreme maneuverability. This perception has held up in the years following the end of flight tests. Air Force tests did not support this expectation. For the flight control system to keep the whole system stable, the ability to initiate a maneuver easily needed to be moderated. This was programmed into the flight control system to preserve the ability to stop the pitching rotation and keep the aircraft from departing out of control. As a result, the whole system as flown (with the flight control system in the loop as well) could not be characterized as having any special increased agility. It was concluded that the X-29 could have had increased agility if it had faster control surface actuators and/or larger control surfaces.

===Aeroelastic considerations===
In a forward swept wing configuration, the aerodynamic lift produces a twisting force which rotates the wing leading edge upward. This results in a higher angle of attack, which increases lift, twisting the wing further. This aeroelastic divergence can quickly lead to structural failure. With conventional metallic construction, a torsionally very stiff wing would be required to resist twisting; stiffening the wing adds weight, which may make the design unfeasible.

The X-29 design made use of the anisotropic elastic coupling between bending and twisting of the carbon fiber composite material to address this aeroelastic effect. Rather than using a very stiff wing, which would carry a weight penalty even with the relatively light-weight composite, the X-29 used a laminate which produced coupling between bending and torsion. As lift increases, bending loads force the wing tips to bend upward. Torsion loads attempt to twist the wing to higher angles of attack, but the coupling resists the loads, twisting the leading edge downward reducing wing angle of attack and lift. With lift reduced, the loads are reduced and divergence is avoided.

==Operational history==
The first X-29 took its maiden flight on 14 December 1984 from Edwards AFB piloted by Grumman&#x27;s Chief Test Pilot Chuck Sewell. The X-29 was the third forward-swept wing jet-powered aircraft design to fly; the other two were the German Junkers Ju 287 (1944) and the HFB-320 Hansa Jet (1964). On 13 December 1985, an X-29 became the first forward-swept wing aircraft to fly at supersonic speed in level flight.


The X-29 began a NASA test program four months after its first flight. The X-29 proved reliable, and by August 1986 was flying research missions of over three hours involving multiple flights. The first X-29 was not equipped with a spin recovery parachute, as flight tests were planned to avoid maneuvers that could result in departure from controlled flight, such as a spin. The second X-29 was given such a parachute and was involved in high angle-of-attack testing. X-29 number two was maneuverable up to an angle of attack of about 25 degrees with a maximum angle of 67° reached in a momentary pitch-up maneuver.

The two X-29 aircraft flew a total of 242 times from 1984 to 1991. The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center reported that the X-29 demonstrated a number of new technologies and techniques, and new uses of existing technologies, including the use of &quot;aeroelastic tailoring to control structural divergence&quot;, aircraft control and handling during extreme instability, three-surface longitudinal control, a &quot;double-hinged trailing-edge flaperon at supersonic speeds&quot;, effective high angle of attack control, vortex control, and demonstration of military utility.

==Aircraft on display==
The first X-29, 82-003, is now on display in the Research and Development Gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air Force on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. The other craft is on display at the Armstrong Flight Research Center on Edwards Air Force Base. A full-scale model was on display from 1989 to 2011 at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s National Mall building in Washington, DC. The full-scale replica was moved to the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, New York in 2011.

==Specifications (X-29)==

== Notable appearances in media ==
The 1989 flight simulator game &quot;F29 Retaliator&quot; was based around the X-29 and imagined a future where it had been developed into a production fighter jet and fitted with various advanced weaponry.

<text>You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby is the second studio album by English electronic music producer Fatboy Slim (Norman Cook). It was first released on 19 October 1998 in the United Kingdom by Skint Records and a day later in the United States by Astralwerks. &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot; proved to be Cook&#x27;s global breakthrough album, peaking at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number 34 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Praised by critics for its sound and style, the album brought international attention to Cook, earning him a Brit Award in 1999, and was later certified four times platinum by the BPI and platinum by the RIAA. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;The Rockafeller Skank&quot;, &quot;Gangster Tripping&quot;, &quot;Praise You&quot;, and &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, all of which peaked within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Build It Up – Tear It Down&quot; was also released as a promotional single.

== Background ==
Cook had a habit of buying obscure vinyl records and sampling elements that he liked. Throughout the 1990’s he built up a library of these samples on floppy discs to create collages. He loaded these into an Akai S900 sampler connected via MIDI to an Atari ST computer with C-Lab Creator software to record and manipulate the samples. For most of the songs he added the bassline and sampled the other elements in a Big Beat style. In early 1998 Cook had success with several remixes while trying out some of the obscure records during his DJ sets. Through the use of a time-stretch method and collaborating with his mixer/engineer Simon Thornton, Cook compiled the songs at his home studio in Brighton, known as the House of Love.

==Title and artwork==
The title &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot; was derived from a marketing slogan for Virginia Slims cigarettes. The cover art, conceived by Red Design, uses a photograph of an obese young man dressed in a T-shirt bearing the words &quot;I&#x27;m #1 so why try harder&quot; while holding a cigarette. The photograph was taken at the 1983 Fat People&#x27;s Festival in Danville, Virginia, and provided by the Rex Features photo library. Cook spent years attempting to identify the man on the cover, hoping to pay him, but as of 2025 had not been successful.

Additional photography for the &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot; liner notes was provided by Simon Thornton. The cover image was changed in North America to an image of shelves stacked with records.

==Critical reception==

&quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot; received critical acclaim. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, it &quot;came damn close to being the definitive big beat album... a seamless record, filled with great imagination, unexpected twists and turns, huge hooks, and great beats.&quot; In 2000, the album was ranked number 81 in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers&#x27; poll of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 1999, it was certified 3× platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), 3×Platinum by the Australian Record Industry Association and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

<text>The Ankara Metro () is the rapid transit system serving Ankara, the capital of Turkey. At present, Ankara&#x27;s rapid transit system consists of three metro lines – the &quot;Ankaray (A1)&quot;, the &quot;M1 - M2 - M3&quot; and the &quot;M4&quot;. The Ankaray, M1, M2 and M3 lines, together transported 104.1 million passengers in 2014. That corresponds to a ridership of approximately 289,155 per day.
In July 2018, the lines M1 and M3 were merged into a single line. Subsequently, in February 2019, the line M2 was also integrated into that service. This merger provides uninterrupted service between Koru and OSB-Törekent. 

== History ==

===Ankaray===
The &quot;Ankaray&quot; (from , meaning &quot;Ankara rail&quot;), a light rail transit system (, though the line does operate as more of a &quot;light metro&quot; line) was the first phase of the modern rapid transit network of the city. The &quot;Ankaray&quot; was constructed by a consortium headed by Siemens over a period of four years (1992–96). It opened on 30 August 1996. The line runs between AŞTİ ( – Ankara Intercity Bus Terminal) and Dikimevi, covering a distance of , of which is through tunnels. The line has 11 stations.

===Ankara Metro===


The &quot;Ankara Metro&quot; has been operating since 29 December 1997, with the opening of its first full metro line, M1, traveling between Kızılay, the city center, and Batıkent. The M2 line, operating from Kızılay, the city center, to Koru, opened 12 February 2014. The M3 line, which serves almost as an extension of the M1 line, operating from Batıkent to OSB-Törekent, opened a month later on 13 March 2014. For the first few years of operations on lines M2 and M3, both of them ran separately from the M1 line; since early 2019, the three lines are operated as one continuous service between OSB-Törekent and Koru.

The M4 line, operating from Kızılay to Şehitler, opened on 5 January 2017 and expanded to Kızılay on 12 April 2023.

In 2019, the Turkish defense firm ASELSAN began traction and control upgrades on the older Bombardier cars.

==Operations==

===Lines===
This table lists the three metro lines (including the Ankaray line) currently in service on the Ankara Metro:

===Stations===
===Rolling stock===
The track width on both subway lines is 1,435 mm (normal gauge).

Vehicles of the Canadian type Hawker H6 run on the M1. The trains in Ankara are a modification of the almost identical H6 trains that were used on the Toronto subway. The vehicles were manufactured by Bombardier until the early 1990s. The structure is made of riveted aluminum and has a gray color. There is an orange stripe around the windows. There are four entrances on each side of each car. In the three-car units, the first and third cars are railcars, the middle car has no separate drive.

The underground trains used on the Ankaray line were built by the Italian wagon manufacturer AnsaldoBreda in Naples, Italy in cooperation with Siemens. Only one of the three-car units has an engine (railcar), the other two cars are not driven (sidecar). The cars are white with orange applications around the windows.

The trains for the current lines and the new ones are built by CSR-MNG (CRRC Zhuzhou) in China. The new cars have many common features with old ones. Both cars have 4 entrances, and only the first and the third cars are railcars and the middle car is a sidecar in the three-car unit. Besides the old stock, the new stock has a separate space for the control panel, located at the front of the first and the third railcar.

== Rolling stock ==

===Ankaray===
&quot;Ankaray&quot; vehicles on the Ankaray line are Siemens-Adtranz-Ansaldobreda, S.P.A. (AnsaldoBreda) M1, M2, and M3 trains, which have a top speed of (operational speed: ), and are equipped with regenerative braking.

The system is served by 11 trainsets. Each trainset comprises 3 sets of 2 cars paired together. Each pair of cars is long, with 60 seats, and can transport a maximum of 308 passengers; thus each trainset is approximately long and can transport 925 passengers per train. The current passenger volume capacity on the Ankaray line is 27,000 passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD).

===Ankara Metro===
The original vehicles used on the M1 line are Bombardier Transportation-built modified versions of the sixth-generation H-series trains used on the Toronto subway. The Toronto trains on which they were based on were built in 1986 by the Urban Transportation Development Corporation (UTDC), a company later purchased by Bombardier. There are a total of 108 of these cars, which are usually configured as 18 six-car trainsets. The car&#x27;s seats are made of rigid plastic, and are all arranged longitudinally. There are no forward- or rear-facing seats, and no seats at the front or rear of each car.

In 2012, a large order of 324 subway cars from CRRC Zhuzhou was placed to supplement the fleet on line M1 and for use on the newer M2, M3 and M4 lines.

== Signalling system ==
Both Ankara Metro and Ankaray depend on Communications-based Train Control railway signalling system. In Ankaray, signals only show whenever there is a train or if a blockage exists or not. However, in Ankara Metro, signals are only activated by automatic control by specific rules.
Unlike other subways, Ankara Metro does not use green signal on normal operations. Only one fixed chunk in front of the train will become available which results in yellow signals at normal operation even more than one chunk is available. The strict rule of flashing (or blinking) yellow signal depends on these two conditions that must be met at the same time: The Metro arriving at the station or present at the station must be in standard operation mode and at least one chunk towards to forward direction must be free. Also, flashing yellow signals are only emitted on forward signals, preventing reverse direction movement in normal operation mode. If one of these conditions are not met (except Operation Mode), the signal will emit red light. While train will out of standard operation mode, the signals will return normal Communitacions-based Train Control rules or manual signal control.
For green and yellow signals, there are 2 different variants; Flashing or static. Flashing signals means either automatic controlled route or manually set route in effect. Static signals are manually controlled or emitted from the control center, however.

Ankaray also uses red, yellow, and green signals. Red and green signals used for indicating is the chunk occupied or not. Unlike the Ankara metro, the yellow signal turns on when a rail change is going to be made.
== Future service ==
Construction of the following metro lines are under construction or planned:

<text>A Venus figurine is any Upper Palaeolithic statue portraying a woman, usually carved in the round. Most have been unearthed in Europe, but others have been found as far away as Siberia and distributed across much of Eurasia.

Most date from the Gravettian period (26,000–21,000 years ago). However, findings are not limited to this period; for example, the Venus of Hohle Fels dates back at least 35,000 years to the Aurignacian era, and the Venus of Monruz dates back about 11,000 years to the Magdalenian. Such figurines were carved from soft stone (such as steatite, calcite or limestone), bone or ivory, or formed of clay and fired. The latter are among the oldest ceramics known to historians. In total, over 200 such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between about in height. These figurines are recognised as some of the earliest works of prehistoric art.

Most have wide hips and legs that taper to a point. Arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva, although many found examples do not reflect these typical characteristics. Depictions of hairstyles can be detailed, and clothing or tattoos may be indicated.

The original cultural meaning and purpose of these artefacts is not known. It has frequently been suggested that they may have served a ritual or symbolic function. There are widely varying and speculative interpretations of their use or meaning: they have been seen as religious figures, an expression of health and fertility, grandmother goddesses, or as self-depictions by female artists.

== History of discovery ==

The &quot;Vénus impudique&quot;, which was the figurine that gave the whole category its name, was the first Palaeolithic sculptural representation of a woman to be discovered in modern times. It was found in 1864 by Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye at Laugerie-Basse in the Vézère valley. This valley is one of the many important Stone Age sites in and around the commune of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil in Dordogne, southwestern France. The figurines were mostly discovered in settlement contexts, both in open-air sites and caves. The Magdalenian Venus from Laugerie-Basse is headless, footless, armless, and displays a strongly emphasised vulva.

Four years later, Salomon Reinach published an article about a group of soapstone figurines from the caves of Balzi Rossi. The famous Venus of Willendorf was excavated in 1908 from a loess deposit in the Danube valley located in Austria. Since then, hundreds of similar figurines have been discovered from the Pyrenees Mountains to the plains of Siberia.

In September 2008, archaeologists from the University of Tübingen discovered a figurine carved from a mammoth&#x27;s tusk. This figurine was later called the Venus of Hohle Fels and can be dated to at least 35,000 years ago. It represents the earliest known sculpture of this type and the earliest known work of figurative art.

== Name ==

Upper Palaeolithic female figurines are collectively described as &quot;Venus figurines&quot; in reference to the Roman goddess of beauty Venus. The name was first used in the mid-nineteenth century by the Marquis de Vibraye, who discovered an ivory figurine and named it &quot;La Vénus impudique&quot; or &quot;Venus Impudica&quot; (&quot;immodest Venus&quot;). The Marquis then contrasted the ivory figurine to the Aphrodite Of Knidos, a Greco-Roman sculpture depicting Venus covering her naked body with both her hands. In the early 20th century, the general belief among scholars was that the figurines represent an ancient ideal of beauty. Since their discovery, considerable diversity in opinion amongst archaeologists and in palaeoanthropological literature has arisen as to the function and significance of the figures. Most scholars that have differing opinions on the purpose of the figurines, such as anthropologist Randall White, also disapprove of the &quot;Venus&quot; name as a result.

The use of the name is metaphorical as there is no link between the ancient figurines and the Roman goddess Venus; although they have been interpreted as representations of a primordial female goddess. This perception is said to have derived from the fact that attention is directed to certain features common to most of the figurines, in particular emotionally charged primary and secondary sexual characteristics such as the breasts, stomachs and buttocks. The term has been criticised for being a reflection of modern Western ideas rather than reflecting the beliefs of the sculptures&#x27; original owners, but the original names are unknown as well, so the term Venus has persisted.

Like many prehistoric artefacts, the exact cultural meaning of these figures may never be known. Archaeologists speculate, however, that they may be symbolic of security and success, fertility, or a mother goddess. The female figures are a part of Upper Palaeolithic art, specifically the category of Palaeolithic art known as portable art.

== Figure details ==
The majority of Venus figurines are depictions of women, and follow artistic conventions of the times. Most of the figurines display the same body shape with the widest point at the abdomen and the female reproductive organs exaggerated. Oftentimes other details, such as the head and limbs, are neglected or absent which leads the figure to be abstracted to the point of simplicity. The heads are often of relatively small size and devoid of detail. Some may represent pregnant women, while others show no indication of pregnancy.

The Venus of Willendorf and the Venus of Laussel (a rock relief rather than a figurine) bear traces of having been externally covered in red ochre. The significance of this is not clear, but is traditionally assumed to be religious or ritual in nature. Some human bodies from the Palaeolithic era are found similarly covered, so it is assumed this colour had a significant meaning in their culture even though we do not know what.

All generally accepted Palaeolithic female figurines are from the Upper Palaeolithic. Although they were originally mostly considered part of the Aurignacian culture, the majority are now associated with the Gravettian and Solutrean cultures. In these periods, the more rotund figurines are predominant. Within the Magdalenian cultures, the forms become finer with more detail and the styling of said figures started to become similar within areas of close contact.

==Interpretation==
Despite being thought as one of the most &#x27;fertile sources of debate in all of archaeology&#x27;, Venus figurines appear to be relatively understudied as a whole. A consequence of this is that they are subject to generalised stereotypes that minimize morphological variation and differing contexts. Nevertheless, there have been many differing interpretations of the figurines since their discovery. 

McCoid and McDermott suggested that because of the way these figures are depicted, such as the large breasts and lack of feet and faces, these statues were made by women looking at their own bodies. They state that women during the period would not have had access to mirrors to maintain accurate proportions or depict the faces or heads of the figurines. The theory remains difficult to prove or disprove, and Michael S. Bisson suggested that alternatives, such as puddles, could have been used as mirrors.

It has also been suggested that the size and shape of the figures makes them suitable for holding through childbirth.

It has been suggested that they may be a sign of an earlier prevalence of steatopygia, now associated principally to women of certain African or Andamanese ancestry.
However the Venuses do not qualify as steatopygian, since they exhibit an angle of approximately 120 degrees between the back and the buttocks, while steatopygia is diagnosed by modern medical standards at an angle of about 90 degrees only.

Another modern interpretation, providing an explanation for visible weight variety amongst the figurines, comes from Johnson et al. Here, they argue that differences in the statues can be said to relate to human adaption to climate change. This is because figurines that are seen to be obese or pregnant originate to the earlier art from 38,000 to 14,000 BP - a period where nutritional stress arose as a result of falling temperatures. Accordingly, they found a correlation between an increase in distance from glacial fronts and a decrease in obesity of the figurines. This was justified as survival and reproduction, in glacial, colder areas, required sufficient nutrition and, consequently, over-nourished woman may have been seen as the ideal of beauty in these areas.

In &quot;The Mythology of Venus Ancient Calendars and Archaeoastronony,&quot; Helen Benigni argues that the consistency in design of these featureless, large-breasted, often pregnant figures throughout a wide region and over a long period of time suggests they represent an archetype of a female Supreme Creator. Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age inhabitants likely connected women as creators innately tied to the cycles of nature.

== Later female figurines and continuity ==

Some scholars suggest a direct continuity between Palaeolithic female figurines and later examples of female depictions from the Neolithic or Bronze Age.

A female figurine which has &quot;no practical use and is portable&quot; and has the common elements of a Venus figurine (a strong accent or exaggeration of female sex-linked traits, and the lack of complete lower limbs) may be considered to be a Venus figurine, even if archaeological evidence suggests it was produced after the main Palaeolithic period. Some figurines matching this definition originate from the Neolithic era and into the Bronze Age. The period and location in which a figurine was produced helps guide archaeologists to reach conclusions as to whether the art piece found can be defined as a Venus figurine or not. For example, ceramic figurines from the late ceramic Neolithic may be accepted as Venus figurines, while stone figurines from later periods are not. This is a matter of ongoing debate given the strong similarity between many figurines from the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and beyond. A reworked endocast of a brachiopod from around 6,000 BCE in Norway has been identified as a late Venus figurine.

This means that a given female figurine may or may not be classified as a Venus figure by any given archaeologist, regardless of its date, though most archaeologists disqualify figurines which date later than the Palaeolithic, even though their purpose could have been the same.

Later, Nieves started his solo career in 1986, setting himself apart by singing salsa in English. He is known for his hits such as &quot;El Amor Más Bonito&quot;, &quot;Sonámbulo&quot;, and the English-salsa hit, &quot;I Like It Like That&quot; (1996). Hits from the album &quot;Fabricando Fantasias&quot; included &quot;Fabricando Fantasias&quot; and &quot;Ya No Queda Nada&quot; with La India, Nicky Jam, and K-Mil. He attended Xaverian High School in Brooklyn, New York, where he played in a Spanish-language band named Makondo. Though he left before graduating, he was given an honorary diploma in 1994.

The main producer and musical director for most of his recorded albums was Sergio George (1988–1993, 2001–2008, 2012–2013, 2018–2020).

In 2007, he released &quot;Canciones Clasicas De Marco Antonio Solís&quot;, a tribute to Mexican singer, Marco Antonio Solís.

On August 12, 2021, Tito Nieves was the featured singer on Norberto Vélez&#x27;s YouTube channel titled &quot;Sesiones Desde La Loma Ep. 19&quot;.

<doc id="571634" wikidata="Q371888" url="?curid=571634" title="Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars">
<text>Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars is the third studio album by English electronic music producer Fatboy Slim. It was first released on 6 November 2000 in the United Kingdom by Skint Records and a day later in the United States by Astralwerks. The album features contributions from Macy Gray, Ashley Slater, Bootsy Collins, Roland Clark, and Roger Sanchez, and its title, referenced in the song &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot;, is an allusion to the Oscar Wilde quote &quot;We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.&quot;

==Edited version==
An edited version also exists, which removes &quot;Star 69&quot; (due to the song&#x27;s recurring use of the word &quot;fuck&quot;, which is the sole reason for obtaining a Parental Advisory label), and removes the song&#x27;s reprise used in &quot;Song for Shelter&quot;. The artwork is also cropped to cut off right before the leg gap, (presumably for the subject likely being nude) and has a mark saying &quot;Kiddies&#x27; Clean Version&quot;, similar in design to the Parental Advisory label on normal copies.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote &quot;this is where Norman Cook achieves the nonstop stupidity breakbeats alone could never bring him&quot;, calling it &quot;All shallow, all pure as a result—pure escape, pure delight, and, as the cavalcade of gospel postures at the end makes clear, pure spiritual yearning. Transcendence, we all want it.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it &quot;a big load of disposable fun and funk that&#x27;s fluffier than cotton candy and just as weighty.&quot;

On the other hand, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote, &quot;After enjoying a few years of relative popularity, it seems big-beat&#x27;s appeal and relevance are waning. [...] After listening to Slim&#x27;s latest, &quot;Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars&quot;, it seems we&#x27;ve reached come-down time. And surprise! It&#x27;s no fun at all&quot;, though &quot;the problem lies more with the everchanging landscape of electronic music and the dying big-beat genre than it does with his technical skill.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;Melodically repetitive, the songs only intermittently approach the energizing highs of earlier Fatboy cuts.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; called it a &quot;post-masterpiece puzzler where the kicks just keep getting harder to find, spread-eagle between pop limitations and artistic aspirations.&quot;

Tim O&#x27;Neil of &quot;PopMatters&quot; later said the album was &quot;extremely underrated&quot;.

==Track listing==

On the iTunes release, &quot;Talking &#x27;bout My Baby (Reprise)&quot; is separated from &quot;Song for Shelter&quot;, making the track times 9:00 and 2:26 respectively.

<doc id="571641" wikidata="Q2252971" url="?curid=571641" title="Vincenzo da Filicaja">
<text>Vincenzo da Filicaja (30 December 164224 September 1707) was an italian poet and politician, citizen of Grand Duchy of Tuscany. His poetry was compared to that of Petrarch, and his association with the Accademia della Crusca gave him access to royal patronage. He served as governor of Volterra and Pisa, successively, and finally in the Tuscan Senate.

== Biography ==
Vincenzo da Filicaja was born in Florence to a prominent aristocratic family. From an incidental notice in one of his letters, stating the amount of house rent paid during his childhood, his parents must have been in easy circumstances, and the supposition is confirmed by the fact that he enjoyed all the advantages of a liberal education, first under the Jesuits of Florence, and then in the University of Pisa. At Pisa he studied law.

After five years in Pisa, he returned to Florence, where he married Anna, daughter of the senator and marquis Scipione Capponi, and withdrew to a small villa at &quot;Al Filicaja&quot; (he always referred to Al Filicaja with the former name of &quot;Figline&quot;), not far from the city. Abjuring the thought of writing amatory poetry due to the premature death of a young lady to whom he had been attached, he occupied himself chiefly with literary pursuits, above all the composition of Italian and Latin poetry. He was a member of the celebrated Accademia della Crusca and had good relations with the patrons of the Capponi family. At this academy he befriended Lorenzo Magalotti, Benedetto Menzini, Gori and Francesco Redi. The latter, author of &quot;Bacchus in Tuscany&quot;, was influential in gaining Filicaja access to court patronage.

Filicaja&#x27;s rural seclusion was due to his limited means than to his rural tastes. But his poetical genius was fired by the deliverance of Vienna from the Turks in 1683, and helped by Redi, who not only laid Filicaja&#x27;s verses before his own sovereign, but had them transmitted with the least possible delay to the foreign princes whose noble deeds were praised. The first recompense came, however, not from those princes, but from Christina, the ex-queen of Sweden, who, from her circle of savants and courtiers at Rome, spontaneously and generously announced to Filicaja her wish to bear the expense of educating his two sons, enhancing her kindness by the delicate request that it should remain a secret.

Filicaja&#x27;s fortunes now improved. In 1691 he became a member of the Academy of Arcadia, assuming the pseudonym of Polibo Emonio. Shortly afterwards, the grand duke of Tuscany, Cosimo III, conferred on him an important office, the commissionership of official balloting. He was named governor of Volterra in 1696, where he strenuously exerted himself to improve public morality. Both there and at Pisa, where he was subsequently governor in 1700, his popularity was so great that on his removal the inhabitants of both cities petitioned for his recall. He passed the close of his life at Florence; the grand duke raised him to the rank of senator, and he died in that city. He was buried in the family vault in the church of San Pietro in Florence, and a monument was erected to his memory by his sole surviving son Scipione Filicaja.

<doc id="571649" wikidata="Q222516" url="?curid=571649" title="Schools of Buddhism">
<text>The schools of Buddhism are the various institutional and doctrinal divisions of Buddhism which are the teachings off buddhist texts. The schools of Buddhism have existed from ancient times up to the present. The classification and nature of various doctrinal, philosophical or cultural facets of the schools of Buddhism is vague and has been interpreted in many different ways, often due to the sheer number (perhaps thousands) of different sects, subsects, movements, etc. that have made up or currently make up the whole of Buddhist traditions. The sectarian and conceptual divisions of Buddhist thought are part of the modern framework of Buddhist studies, as well as comparative religion in Asia. Some factors in Buddhism appear to be consistent, such as the afterlife. 

From a largely English-language standpoint, and to some extent in most of Western academia, Buddhism is separated into two groups: Theravāda ( &#x27;the Teaching of the Elders&#x27; or &#x27;the Ancient Teaching&#x27;), and Mahāyāna ( &#x27;the Great Vehicle&#x27;). The most common classification among scholars is threefold: Theravāda, Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna.

== Classifications ==
In contemporary Buddhist studies, modern Buddhism is often divided into three major branches, traditions or categories:
* Theravāda (&quot;Teaching of the Elders&quot;), also called &quot;Southern Buddhism&quot;, mainly dominant in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. This tradition generally focuses on the study of its main textual collection, the Pali Canon as well as other forms of Pali literature. The Pali language is thus its lingua franca and sacred language. This tradition is sometimes denominated as a part of Nikaya Buddhism, referring to the conservative Buddhist traditions in India who did not accept the Mahayana sutras into their Tripitaka collection of scriptures. It is also sometimes seen as the only surviving school out of the Early Buddhist schools, being derived from the Sthavira Nikāya via the Sri Lankan Mahavihara tradition.
* East Asian Mahāyāna (&quot;Great Vehicle&quot;), East Asian Buddhism or &quot;Eastern Buddhism&quot;, prominent in East Asia and derived from the Chinese Buddhist traditions which began to develop during the Han Dynasty. This tradition focuses on the teachings found in Mahāyāna sutras (which are not considered canonical or authoritative in Theravāda school), preserved in the Chinese Buddhist Canon, in the classical Chinese language. There are many schools and traditions, with different texts and focuses, such as Zen Buddhism (Chan) and Pure Land (see below).
* Vajrayāna (&quot;&quot;Vajra&quot; Vehicle&quot;), also known as Mantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism. This category is mostly represented in &quot;Northern Buddhism&quot;, also called &quot;Indo-Tibetan Buddhism&quot; (or just &quot;Tibetan Buddhism&quot;), but also overlaps with certain forms of East Asian Buddhism (see: Shingon). It is prominent in Tibet, Bhutan, Sikkim, and the Himalayan region as well as in Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, and the Russian republics of Buryatia, Kalmykia, and Tuva. It is sometimes considered to be a part of the broader category of Mahāyāna Buddhism instead of a separate tradition. The main texts of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism are contained in the Kanjur and the Tenjur. Besides the study of major Mahāyāna texts, this branch emphasizes the study of Buddhist tantric materials, mainly those related to the Buddhist tantras.

Another way of classifying the different forms of Buddhism is through the different monastic ordination traditions. There are three main traditions of monastic law (&quot;Vinaya&quot;) each corresponding to the first three categories outlined above:
* Theravāda &quot;Vinaya&quot;
* Dharmaguptaka &quot;Vinaya&quot; (East Asian Mahayana)
* Mūlasarvāstivāda &quot;Vinaya&quot; (Tibetan Buddhism)

== Terminology ==
The terminology for the major divisions of Buddhism can be confusing, as Buddhism is variously divided by scholars and practitioners according to geographic, historical, and philosophical criteria rather than the criteria of adherents, with different terms often being used in different contexts. The following terms may be encountered in descriptions of the major Buddhist divisions:
;&quot;Conservative Buddhism&quot;: an alternative name for the early Buddhist schools.
;&quot;Early Buddhist schools&quot;: the schools into which Buddhism became divided in its first few centuries; only one of these, Theravāda, survives as an independent school. 
;&quot;East Asian Buddhism&quot;: a term used by scholars to cover the Buddhist traditions of Japan, Korea, Vietnam and most of China and Southeast Asia
;&quot;Eastern Buddhism&quot;: an alternative name used by some scholars for East Asian Buddhism; also sometimes used to refer to all traditional forms of Buddhism, as distinct from Western(ized) forms.
;&quot;Ekayāna&quot; (one yana): Mahayana texts such as the Lotus Sutra and the Avatamsaka Sutra sought to unite all the different teachings into a single great way. These texts serve as the inspiration for using the term Ekayāna in the sense of &quot;one vehicle&quot;. This &quot;one vehicle&quot; became a key aspect of the doctrines and practices of Tiantai and Tendai Buddhist sects, which subsequently influenced Chán and Zen doctrines and practices. In Japan, the one-vehicle teaching of the Lotus Sutra also is also a main doctrine of Nichiren Buddhist sects. The &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; has so much influence that meditation was replaced by chanting the Japanese words &quot;Namu Myoho Renge Kyo&quot; (&quot;The Way of the Lotus Sutra&quot;) in religious practice.
;&quot;Esoteric Buddhism&quot;: usually considered synonymous with &quot;Vajrayāna&quot;. Some scholars have applied the term to certain practices found within the Theravāda, particularly in Cambodia.
;&quot;Hīnayāna&quot;: literally meaning &quot;lesser vehicle&quot;. It is considered a controversial term when applied by the Mahāyāna, to refer to the Theravāda school, and as such is widely viewed as condescending and pejorative. Moreover, Hīnayāna refers to the now non-extant schools with limited set of views, practices, and results, prior to the development of the Mahāyāna traditions. The term is currently most often used as a way of describing a stage on the path in Tibetan Buddhism, but is often mistakenly confused with the contemporary Theravāda tradition, which is far more complex, diversified, and profound, than the literal and limiting definition attributed to &quot;Hīnayāna&quot;. Its use in scholarly publications is now also considered controversial.
;&quot;Lamaism&quot;: synonymous with &quot;Tibetan Buddhism&quot;; an old term, sometimes still used, but widely considered derogatory.
;&quot;Mahāyāna&quot;: a movement that emerged from early Buddhist schools, together with its later descendants, East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism. Vajrayāna traditions are sometimes listed separately. The main use of the term in East Asian and Tibetan traditions is in reference to spiritual levels, regardless of school.
;&quot;Mainstream Buddhism&quot;: a term used by some scholars for the early Buddhist schools.
;&quot;Mantrayāna&quot;: usually considered synonymous with &quot;Vajrayāna&quot;. The Tendai school in Japan has been described as influenced by Mantrayana.
;&quot;Navayāna&quot;: (&quot;new vehicle&quot;) refers to the re-interpretation of Buddhism by modern Indian jurist and social reformer B. R. Ambedkar.
;&quot;Newar Buddhism&quot;: a non-monastic, caste based Buddhism with patrilineal descent and Sanskrit texts.
;&quot;Nikāya Buddhism&quot;: a non-derogatory substitute term for Hinayana or the early Buddhist schools.
;&quot;Non-Mahāyāna&quot;: an alternative term for the early Buddhist schools.
;&quot;Northern Buddhism&quot;: an alternative term used by some scholars for Tibetan Buddhism. Also, an older term still sometimes used to encompass both East Asian and Tibetan traditions. It has even been used to refer to East Asian Buddhism alone, without Tibetan Buddhism.
;&quot;Secret Mantra&quot;: an alternative rendering of &quot;Mantrayāna&quot;, a more literal translation of the term used by schools in Tibetan Buddhism when referring to themselves.
;&quot;Sectarian Buddhism&quot;: an alternative name for the early Buddhist schools.
;&quot;Southeast Asian Buddhism&quot;: an alternative name used by some scholars for Theravāda.
;&quot;Southern Buddhism&quot;: an alternative name used by some scholars for &quot;Theravāda&quot;.
;&quot;Śrāvakayāna&quot;: an alternative term sometimes used for the early Buddhist schools.
;&quot;Tantrayāna&quot; or &quot;Tantric Buddhism&quot;: usually considered synonymous with &quot;Vajrayāna&quot;. However, one scholar describes the tantra divisions of some editions of the Tibetan scriptures as including Śravakayāna, Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna texts (see Buddhist texts). Some scholars, particularly François Bizot, have used the term &quot;Tantric Theravada&quot; to refer to certain practices found particularly in Cambodia.
;&quot;Theravāda&quot;: the Buddhism of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and parts of Vietnam, China, India, and Malaysia. It is the only surviving representative of the historical &quot;early Buddhist schools&quot;. The term &quot;Theravāda&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to &quot;all&quot; of the early Buddhist schools.
;&quot;Tibetan Buddhism&quot;: usually understood as including the Buddhism of Tibet, Mongolia, Bhutan, and parts of China, India, and Russia, which follow the Tibetan tradition.
;&quot;Vajrayāna&quot;: a movement that developed out of Indian &quot;Mahāyāna&quot;, together with its later descendants. There is some disagreement on exactly which traditions fall into this category. Tibetan Buddhism is universally recognized as falling under this heading; many also include the Japanese &quot;Shingon&quot; school. Some scholars also apply the term to the Korean &quot;milgyo tradition&quot;, which is not a separate school. One scholar says, &quot;Despite the efforts of generations of Buddhist thinkers, it remains exceedingly difficult to identify precisely what it is that sets the &quot;Vajrayana&quot; apart.&quot;

== Early schools ==
The early Buddhist schools or mainstream sects refers to the sects into which the Indian Buddhist monastic saṅgha split. They are also called the Nikaya Buddhist schools, Ezhuthupally, and in Mahayana Buddhism they are referred to either as the Śrāvaka (disciple) schools or Hinayana (inferior) schools.

Most scholars now believe that the first schism was originally caused by differences in &quot;vinaya&quot; (monastic rule). Later splits were also due to doctrinal differences and geographical separation.

The first schism separated the community into two groups, the Sthavira (Elders) Nikaya and the Mahāsāṃghika (Great Community). Most scholars hold that this probably occurred after the time of Ashoka. Out of these two main groups later arose many other sects or schools.

From the Sthaviras arose the Sarvāstivāda sects, the Vibhajyavādins, the Theravadins, the Dharmaguptakas and the Pudgalavāda sects.

The Sarvāstivāda school, popular in northwest India and Kashmir, focused on Abhidharma teachings. Their name means &quot;the theory that all exists&quot; which refers to one of their main doctrines, the view that all dharmas exist in the past, present and in the future. This is an eternalist theory of time. Over time, the Sarvāstivādins became divided into various traditions, mainly the Vaibhāṣika (who defended the orthodox &quot;all exists&quot; doctrine in their Abhidharma compendium called the &quot;Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra&quot;), the Sautrāntika (who rejected the Vaibhāṣika orthodoxy) and the Mūlasarvāstivāda.

The Pudgalavāda sects (also known as &quot;Vātsīputrīyas&quot;) were another group of Sthaviras which were known for their unique doctrine of the &quot;pudgala&quot; (person). Their tradition was founded by the elder Vātsīputra circa 3rd century BCE.

The Vibhajyavādins were conservative Sthaviras who did not accept the doctrines of either the Sarvāstivāda or the Pudgalavāda. In Sri Lanka, a group of them became known as Theravada, the only one of these sects that survives to the present day. Another sect which arose from the Vibhajyavādins were the Dharmaguptakas. This school was influential in spreading Buddhism to Central Asia and to China. Their Vinaya is still used in East Asian Buddhism.

The Mahāsāṃghikas also split into various sub groups. One of these were the Lokottaravādins (Transcendentalists), so called because of their doctrine which saw every action of the Buddha, even mundane ones like eating, as being of a supramundane and transcendental nature. One of the few Mahāsāṃghika texts which survive, the &quot;Mahāvastu&quot;, is from this school. Another sub-sect which emerged from the Mahāsāṃghika was called the Caitika. They were concentrated in Andhra Pradesh and in South India. Some scholars such as A.K. Warder hold that many important Mahayana sutras originated among these groups. Another Mahāsāṃghika sect was named Prajñaptivāda. They were known for the doctrine that viewed all conditioned phenomena as being mere concepts (Skt. &quot;prajñapti&quot;).

According to the Indian philosopher Paramartha, a further split among the Mahāsāṃghika occurred with the arrival of the Mahayana sutras. Some sub-schools, such as the Kukkuṭikas, did not accept the Mahayana sutras as being word of the Buddha, whole others, like the Lokottaravādins, did accept them.

Although there are differences in the historical records as to the exact composition of the various schools of early Buddhism, a hypothetical combined list would be as follows:
== Theravāda ==

Theravāda is the only extant mainstream non-Mahayana school. They are derived from the Sri Lankan Mahāvihāra sect, which was a branch of the South Indian Vibhajjavādins. Theravāda bases its doctrine on the Pāli Canon, the only complete Buddhist canon surviving in a classical Indian language. This language is Pāli, which serves as the school&#x27;s sacred language and lingua franca.

The different sects and groups in Theravāda often emphasize different aspects (or parts) of the Pāli canon and the later commentaries (especially the very influential Visuddhimagga), or differ in the focus on and recommended way of practice. There are also significant differences in strictness or interpretation of the Vinaya Pitaka, the Theravādin Vinaya followed by monastics of this tradition.

The various divisions in Theravāda include:
* Indian Theravāda (mostly historical, although revived in the modern period partly through the Vipassana movement)
* Sri Lankan Theravāda
** Amarapura–Rāmañña Nikāya
*** Delduwa
*** Kanduboda (or Swejin Nikaya)

== Mahāyāna schools ==

===Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism===

Mahāyāna (Great Vehicle) Buddhism is category of traditions which focus on the bodhisattva path and affirm texts known as Mahāyāna sutras. These texts are seen by modern scholars as dating as far back as the 1st century BCE. Unlike Theravada and other early schools, Mahāyāna schools generally hold that there are currently many Buddhas which are accessible, and that they are transcendental or supramundane beings.

In India, there were two major traditions of Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophy. The earliest was the Mādhyamaka (&quot;Middle Way&quot;), also known as the &quot;Śūnyavāda&quot; (&quot;Emptiness&quot;) school. This tradition followed the works of the philosopher Nāgārjuna (–). Two subsects of the Madhyamaka school that developed were the Svatantrika, founded by the 6th-century Indian philosopher Bhāviveka, and the Prasangika, founded by Chandrakirti and later advanced by Je Tsongkhapa, 14th-century founder of the Gelug sect in Tibet.

The other major school of Indian Mahayana was the Yogācāra (&quot;yoga practice&quot;) school, also known as the &quot;Vijñānavāda&quot; (&quot;the doctrine of consciousness&quot;), &quot;Vijñaptivāda&quot; (&quot;the doctrine of ideas or percepts&quot;), or &quot;Cittamātra&quot; (&quot;mind-only&quot;) school, founded by Asanga in the 4th century AD. 

Some scholars also note that the compilers of the Tathāgatagarbha texts constitute a third &quot;school&quot; of Indian Mahāyāna. This movement heavily influenced East Asian and Tibetan Mahayana schools such as the Dashabhumika, Huayan, Tiantai, Jonang, Nichiren and Zen sects, as did both Madhyamaka and Yogacara.

===East Asian Mahayana===
East Asian Buddhism or East Asian Mahayana refers to the schools that developed in East Asia and use the Chinese Buddhist canon. It is a major religion in China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. East Asian Buddhists constitute the numerically largest body of Buddhist traditions in the world, numbering over half of the world&#x27;s Buddhists.

East Asian Mahayana began to develop in China during the Han dynasty (when Buddhism was first introduced from Central Asia). It is thus influenced by Chinese culture and philosophy. East Asian Mahayana developed new, uniquely Asian interpretations of Buddhist texts and focused on the study of sutras.

East Asian Buddhist monastics generally follow the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya.

== Esoteric schools ==
Esoteric Buddhism, also known as Vajrayāna, Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Secret Mantra, and Tantric Buddhism is often placed in a separate category by scholars due to its unique tantric features and elements (instead of being grouped as part of Mahayana school). Esoteric Buddhism arose and developed in medieval India among esoteric adepts known as Mahāsiddhas. Esoteric Buddhism maintains its own set of texts alongside the classic scriptures, these esoteric works are known as the Buddhist Tantras. It includes practices that make use of mantras, dharanis, mudras, mandalas and the visualization of deities and Buddhas.

Main Esoteric Buddhist traditions include:
* Indian Esoteric Buddhism (Historical)
* Newar Esoteric Buddhism
* Ari Buddhism (Historical)
* Tantric Theravada
* Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism
* Philippine Esoteric Buddhism
* Azhaliism
* Tibetan Buddhism, the most widespread of these traditions, is practiced in Tibet, Mongolia, Inner Mongolia and few other parts of China, parts of Nepal, North India (incl. Sikkhim) and Siberia, Bhutan. Monastics of this tradition generally follow the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya.

<text>Topo Gigio () is a fictional anthropomorphic mouse, originally the lead character of a children&#x27;s puppet show on Italian television in the early 1960s. The character, created in 1958 by artist Maria Perego, her husband Federico Caldura and fellow artist Guido Stagnaro, debuted on RAI in 1959 and has been customarily voiced by actor Giuseppe &quot;Peppino&quot; Mazzullo and later Davide Garbolino. His name literally translates to &#x27;Louie Mouse&#x27;, as is the Italian word for &#x27;mouse&#x27; and &quot;Gigio&quot; is a nickname for &quot;Luigi&quot; (&#x27;Louis&#x27;).

Topo Gigio was popular in Italy for many years: not only on TV, but also in comics, such as the classical &quot;Corriere dei Piccoli&quot;, cartoons, merchandising and films. The character&#x27;s popularity spread around the world after being featured on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in the U.S. in 1963.

Today, Topo Gigio still has fans and has become an icon of Italian pop culture. He performs regularly at Zecchino d&#x27;Oro festival and other programs created by Antoniano and RAI. The character also spawned two feature-length films, &quot;The Magic World of Topo Gigio&quot; (1965) and &quot;Topo Gigio and the Missile War&quot; (1967), and two animated TV series that first aired in 1988 and 2020, respectively.

The puppet has made appearances and has a fan base in many other countries—including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Spain, Uruguay, Venezuela and the former Yugoslavia.

==Dedicated media==
===Television===
* Topo Gigio was created in 1958 by the artist &quot;Madame&quot; Maria Perego and Guido Stagnaro, and starred in a children&#x27;s television show in Italy in the early 1960s. He remains a fixture of Italian pop culture and still performs regularly at festivals in Italy.
* Topo Gigio was immensely popular in his home country and became a worldwide sensation after his recurring appearances, beginning in 1963, on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, in the United States. Created by a troupe of Italian puppeteers, it took four people to bring the 10-inch-tall () character to life: three to manipulate him, and one to create his voice. The puppet stood in a special &quot;limbo&quot; black art stage with black velvet curtains, designed to absorb as much ambient light as possible, which helped hide the puppeteers, who were also dressed in black from head to toe. Each puppeteer operated a different part of Gigio&#x27;s foam rubber body by using several wooden dowel rods (also painted black). The illusion was quite remarkable, since unlike traditional hand puppets, Topo Gigio could actually appear to walk on his feet, sing, make subtle hand gestures, and even walk up Ed Sullivan&#x27;s arm and perch on his shoulder. Careful lighting and TV camera adjustment made the &quot;black art&quot; illusion perfect for the television audience, though on at least one appearance, Ed asked the puppeteers to come out and take a bow, revealing their black-clad appearance (though deftly hiding Gigio&#x27;s mechanisms to conceal the secret). In more than fifty appearances on the show, the mouse would appear on stage and greet Sullivan with, &quot;Hello, Eddie!&quot;. Gigio would occasionally talk about his girlfriend, Rosie. Gigio ended his weekly visits by crooning to the host, &quot;Eddie, kiss me goodnight!&quot; (pronounced as &quot;Keesa me goo&#x27;night!&quot;). Topo Gigio closed Sullivan&#x27;s final show in 1971.
* During the first half of the 1960s (especially in 1964), Topo Gigio also appeared in a TV music show presented by the British singer Chris Howland, both in Austria and Germany.
* In the United Kingdom, Topo Gigio appeared on the first of many occasions on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; with Jimmy Tarbuck (Compere), Nina &amp; Frederik and Lonnie Donegan in 1965.
* In Hispanic America, Topo Gigio became a smash hit in 1968, featuring Braulio Castillo, Raúl Astor (Raúl Ignacio Spangenberg), and later, Julio Alemán. The show was produced in Peru and then in Mexico. The character is still popular in Italian and Spanish speaking territories.
* A 1969 children&#x27;s television show called &quot;Cappuccetto and Her Adventures&quot; was broadcast in Austria and Switzerland. The show featured Cappuccetto with her friends Lupo Lupone, Professor Lhotko, a fox, some forest animals, her grandmother, and a music band with five mushrooms playing on guitars and singing.
* The character was also introduced to Spain, Portugal, Japan and Brazil. &quot;Topo Gigio&quot;, an animated television series produced by Nippon Animation, aired in Japan for two seasons in 1988. In 1979, Topo Gigio got his own television show on Portuguese television, with the voice of António Semedo. He later performed regularly on the show &quot;Sequim d &#x27;Ouro&quot;&#x27;, and in 2000, Topo Gigio joined &quot;Big Show Sic&quot; produced by Ediberto Lima.
* An Italian animated series was released on RaiPlay in April 2020.

===Films===
The character has starred in several feature films, including:
* The feature film &quot;The Magic World of Topo Gigio&quot; (1961) is considered lost media. 
* &quot;Topo Gigio and the Missile War&quot; (1967), a Japanese-Italian international co-production directed by Kon Ichikawa.
* &quot;Topo Gigio no castelo do Conde Drácula&quot; (1989, Pedro Siaretta)

===Music===
* Topo Gigio had several LPs with songs sung by Gabriel Garzón.
* On the fourth night of the Sanremo Music Festival 2025, Lucio Corsi and Topo Gigio sang &quot;Nel blu, dipinto di blu&quot;.

===Spokesperson and mascot===
* Topo Gigio has been the official mascot of the Uruguayan club Huracán Buceo since 1968.

==Appearances and references in popular culture==

===Schools===
* In Fortaleza (Brazil), there was a school named after the character.

===Sports===
* Argentine footballer Carlos Tevez claimed that his goal celebrations were to honour Topo Gigio after Manchester City&#x27;s 2–1 win over his former club and fierce rivals Manchester United in the League Cup semi-final first leg 2009/10 season. Tevez claimed that his Argentine team mate Juan Román Riquelme also honours Topo Gigio with his goal celebrations.

===Restaurant===
* There was a restaurant in the West End of London, named &quot;Ristorante Topo Gigio&quot;, which closed in 2008.

<doc id="571656" wikidata="Q1025166" url="?curid=571656" title="Cadillac Cimarron">
<text>The Cadillac Cimarron was an entry-level luxury car manufactured and marketed by the Cadillac division of General Motors for model years 1982–1988 over a single generation, with a mild facelift in 1985. 

The first post-war compact car offered by the brand, the four-door was developed to compete with similarly-sized premium sedans marketed by European automakers in North America. 

The flagship offering of the GM J platform, the Cimarron had joined the project just eleven months prior to the J-Cars&#x27; arrival in showrooms, and Cadillac had very little involvement in the program. Marketed with counterparts from Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick, the Cimarron was to become one of the most controversial examples of badge engineering in the American automotive industry, sharing much of its entire design, including its exterior, with the Chevrolet Cavalier and GM&#x27;s other brand variants.

Through its entire production, the Cimarron was manufactured at South Gate Assembly (1981–1982) and Janesville Assembly (1982–1988); both facilities produced the model alongside the Chevrolet Cavalier and its J-platform badge-engineered variants. In North America, the Cimarron was not replaced directly.

The Cimarron is noted as a of GM&#x27;s product planningfor its low sales, poor performance and ill-conceived badge engineering.

== Background ==
As General Motors prepared for the 1980s, Cadillac product planners considered introducing a sedan smaller than the Seville. While the Seville model had sold well following its 1975 introduction, in its research, Cadillac discovered a growing proportion of buyers of the Seville were not conquest customers of European brands, but American-brand customers seeking a smaller sedan. To further diversify and modernize their product range to compete with European luxury sedans, Cadillac dealers were demanding a smaller car below the Seville that could compete with the compact offerings of European brands.

In early 1980, General Motors commenced development of a Cadillac version of the GM J-car platform, leading to one of the shortest development programs ever undertaken by the company. Ultimately, the Cimarron&#x27;s development window was confined to 10 months, and aside from modest interior changes, exterior modifications were confined to reworking the grille, adjacent composite (plastic) panels and tail lights.

Originally scheduled for mid-1980s release, the launch of the Cimarron was pushed to early 1981 in order to match the 1982 model-year release of its J-car counterparts for the Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac divisions. In development since 1976 to replace the H-body, the J-car marked two major changes: shifting to front-wheel drive and expanding into the compact car segment. In line with its predecessor, the J-car was to be the Chevrolet Cavalier (replacing the Monza), Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Firenza (a premium trim of the previous Starfire), and Pontiac J2000 (replacing the Sunbird, eventually taking on the Sunbird name); the J-car was also to be sold by Opel/Vauxhall, Holden, and Isuzu worldwide.

While the creation of the Cadillac Cimarron was intended to give the division a compact sedan that matched multiple European premium brands, the selection of the J-car platform within 14 months of its launch was met with heavy resistance. Pete Estes, GM president at the time, warned Cadillac general manager Edward Kennard: &quot;Ed, you don&#x27;t have time to turn the J-car into a Cadillac.&quot; The original design offered little more than a well-equipped Chevrolet Cavalier, but cost twice as much.

In 1976, Cadillac had previous success with the Cadillac Seville on a dedicated GM &quot;K&quot; platform which was a stretched version of the GM &quot;X&quot; platform used for the Chevrolet Nova.

== Model name ==
At its May 21, 1981 introduction, the copy text of original sales brochures associated the Cimarron nameplate with &quot;fortitude, adventure and pioneering&quot;. The nameplate was chosen from a list that included J2000 (used on predecessor of Pontiac Sunbird); Carmel; Cascade; Caville (blend of &quot;Cadillac&quot; and &quot;De Ville&quot;); Envoy (used decades later on an unrelated SUV by sister division GMC); and Series 62 (predecessor of Cadillac Calais).

For 1982 production, the model was marketed as &quot;Cimarron by Cadillac&quot;, although initially the Cadillac name did not appear anywhere on the car. Cadillac salespeople were even admonished not to refer to the car as the &quot;Cadillac Cimarron&quot;, but merely as &quot;the Cimarron&quot;. For 1983, the naming was revised to &quot;Cadillac Cimarron&quot;; for the rest of its production, the &quot;Cadillac&quot; script appeared only on the grille.

== Design ==
The Cimarron used the front-wheel drive GM J platform with a wheelbase. Employing unibody construction, the suspension, which was calibrated with GM&#x27;s &quot;F41&quot; suspension, used front MacPherson struts which were mounted to a subframe, lower control arms, coil springs and a stabilizer bar, while a torsion-beam rear axle, along with rear stabilizer bars, was shared with the Buick Skyhawk and Oldsmobile Firenza and was borrowed from the GM &quot;X&quot; and &quot;A&quot; platforms.

To distinguish the Cimarron from the Chevrolet Cavalier and its Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac counterparts, Cadillac standardized many of the available features offered on J-platform cars at the time. The listed retail price for 1982 was $12,181 () and the standard equipment were air conditioning, additional sound insulation, Trianon deep-pile carpeting including the trunk, aluminum alloy wheels on steel-belted radial tires, twin power adjustable side view mirrors, leather-wrapped steering wheel, full instrumentation including tachometer (the only Cadillac to have this at the time), courtesy lights, intermittent wipers, rear window defogger, and AM/FM stereo. Its interior featured simulated aluminum trim, notably initially foregoing simulated wood trim, which was added in later years with appearance updates. Leather was offered for the upholstery and door panels only in the Cimarron, and the name &quot;Cimarron&quot; was embroidered on the seatback surface. Digital instruments were offered in 1986 along with Touch Climate Control air conditioning, and a leather and suede upholstery option was later offered. The dashboard assembly was shared with the Cavalier and the Sunbird, while the Firenza and Skyhawk shared an entirely different design. Twilight Sentinel and fog lights were added as standard equipment in 1983.

Available options for 1982 included automatic transmission for $370, cruise control for $155, tilt steering wheel for $88, power windows for $216, power door locks for $12, power driver and passenger seats for $366 for both, Vista Vent with rear tilt sunroof for $261, and a choice of a cassette player, $153 with a separate choice offering a CB radio for $560. Additional convenience and appearance options available were twin lighted vanity mirrors for $92, power trunk release for $29, door edge guards for $22, license plate frame for $12, trunk lid luggage rack for $98, carpeted floor mats front for $38 and rear for $22, trunk mat for $18 and whitewall tires for $55. With the exception of its upholstery and model-specific special suspension tuning, J-platform sedans from other GM divisions could be optioned nearly identically to a Cimarron, though doing so would raise prices close to the Cimarron&#x27;s base price.

=== Powertrain ===
For 1982, the Cimarron was equipped with a Chevrolet-built 1.8 L four-cylinder engine, producing (the first four-cylinder Cadillac since the 1914 Cadillac Model 1914 and the first engine below 2.0 L displacement since 1908). For 1983, the engine was enlarged to a Chevrolet-built 2.0 L and given throttle-body fuel injection, though engine tuning would drop peak output to . For 1985, a Chevrolet-built 2.8 L V6, which was shared only with the Chevrolet Cavalier coupe and Oldsmobile Firenza hatchback, was added as an option, producing ; the V6 became the standard engine for 1988 but was not available in the Cavalier or Firenza sedans. Both engines were paired with a four-speed or five-speed manual depending on model year, with a three-speed automatic as an option, shared with other division vehicles.

== Model history ==
For 1983, the grille was updated; the center-mounted crest emblem was replaced with an offset &quot;Cadillac&quot; script. The hard plastic storage bin was removed from the rear passenger seat.

For 1984 and 1985, Cimarron was offered with a special option package called &quot;d’Oro&quot;. Essentially a gold trim package (&quot;d’Oro&quot; translates to &quot;golden&quot; from Italian and Spanish) with a unique hood badge, the option added gold accents to the aluminum alloy wheels, grille, and bumper rub strips, along with accent stripes on the belt line and hood centerline. The interior featured a &quot;d’Oro&quot; instrument panel plaque and gold-finish steering wheel spokes. For 1984, the option was offered only with a black exterior and a tan leather interior; all trim on the bumpers was black, along with smoke-grey foglamp covers. For 1985, the &quot;d’Oro&quot; option added white and red exterior colors, and grooved lower-body trim was color-keyed to match the body.

For 1985, the exterior underwent a minor revision for the first time. Alongside a new grille which distanced the appearance from the Cavalier, a &quot;power dome&quot; hood was introduced; silver-color grooved lower-body trim was introduced. Dependent on trim, grille badging retained the &quot;Cadillac&quot; script or returned the Cadillac crest.

For 1986, the rear fascia underwent a separate revision, including wraparound tail lamps. A premium Delco–Bose &quot;Symphony Sound&quot; with integrated equalizer and cassette player was introduced as an option. This was the final year for the Cimarron in Canada.

For 1987, the front fascia underwent a second revision, receiving composite-lens headlamp units (the first American J-body to do so) and redesigned alloy wheels.

For its last year in the United States, the Cimarron received several engineering updates.

=== Discontinuation ===
As the Cimarron was still selling 15,000 to 20,000 units annually, Cadillac initially sought to keep the model in production. While Cimarron sales had been lower than predicted, many of them were to conquest buyers new to Cadillac and younger in age than the typical Cadillac buyer of the time.

In a 9-to-1 vote, General Motors management instead decided to discontinue the model for multiple reasons including Cimarron&#x27;s disappointing sales and the company wanting to prioritize its resources towards major updates of the 1988 Eldorado and Seville and 1989 Sedan de Ville and Fleetwood. While the larger Brougham was ultimately redesigned for 1993 (becoming the Fleetwood Brougham), GM saw no upside towards continuation of the Cimarron, as it also sought to limit the price overlap between Cadillac, Buick, and Oldsmobile.

==Reception and legacy==
The Cimarron&#x27;s market failure is one in a series of events throughout the 1980s and 1990s which caused Cadillac&#x27;s share of the US market to decline from 3.8% in 1979 to 2.2% in 1997; it is routinely cited as the nadir of GM&#x27;s product planning:

*Noted automotive journalist Dan Neil included the Cimarron in his 2007 list of &quot;Worst Cars of all Time&quot;, saying &quot;everything that was wrong, venal, lazy, and mendacious about GM in the 1980s was crystallized in this flagrant insult to the good name and fine customers of Cadillac.&quot; He added that the Cimarron &quot;nearly killed Cadillac and remains its biggest shame.&quot;
*&quot;Forbes&quot; placed the Cimarron on its list of &quot;Legendary Car Flops&quot;, citing low sales, poor performance and the fact the car &quot;didn&#x27;t work, coming from a luxury brand.&quot;
*CarBuzz called the Cimarron a &quot;textbook example of what goes wrong when a carmaker tries to badge engineer an economy car into a luxury car.&quot;
*&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine said the Cimarron &quot;appealed neither to Cadillac&#x27;s loyal followers, who appreciated powerful V8s and Cadillac&#x27;s domestic luxury edge, nor to buyers who favored Europe&#x27;s luxury brands, whose cars out-handled and out-classed the Cimarron in every way.&quot;
*CNN Money described the Cimarron as &quot;in all important respects, a Chevrolet Cavalier. It also added thousands to the price tag. In all, it was neither a good Cadillac nor a good value. Today, GM executives will readily admit that this was a bad idea.&quot;
*In its introduction of the Cadillac BLS, &quot;Car and Driver&quot; said that Cadillac product director John Howell kept a picture of a Cimarron on his wall, captioned &quot;Lest we forget&quot;.

Since the withdrawal of the Cimarron after the 1988 model year, Cadillac has not produced a direct successor to the model line. Subsequent Cadillac sedans derived from other GM vehicles, including the Cadillac Catera (Opel Omega) and the Cadillac BLS (Saab 9-3) were not compact executive cars, in terms of size. The smallest current Cadillac sedan (the Cadillac CT4 and its Cadillac ATS predecessor) is a compact executive car larger than the Cimarron, sharing no common body panels with other GM sedans.

Cimarron had some firsts for Cadillac: first four-cylinder engine since 1910s, first manual transmission since 1950s, first-ever &quot;export&quot; taillights with separate amber turn signal indicators (for the US market), first compact-sized car, and so forth.

==Yearly American sales==
GM ended sales of the Cimarron following the 1988 model year. Oldsmobile&#x27;s J-car variant, the Firenza, was also discontinued that year, followed by the J-car Buick Skyhawk in 1989. By 1990, the sub-compact, J-car economy model range in North America was pared down solely to Chevrolet and Pontiac. The turbocharged engine was not available in the Buick sedan and the V6 engine was not available in the Firenza sedan while the V6 became optional in the Cimarron starting 1985.

<doc id="571660" wikidata="Q1450753" url="?curid=571660" title="Parliament of Sri Lanka">
<text>The Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (Sinhala: ශ්‍රී ලංකා පාර්ලිමේන්තුව &quot;Śrī Laṇkā Pārlimentuvā&quot;, Tamil: இலங்கை நாடாளுமன்றம் &quot;Ilaṅkai nāṭāḷumaṉṟam&quot;) is the supreme legislative body of Sri Lanka. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the island. It is modeled after the British Parliament. The 17th Parliament of Sri Lanka will convene for the first time on 21 November 2024.

It consists of 225 members known as Members of Parliament (MPs). Members are elected by proportional representation for five-year terms, with universal suffrage.

The President of Sri Lanka has the power to summon, suspend, prorogue, or terminate a legislative session and to dissolve the Parliament. The President can dissolve Parliament only after the lapse of years or if a majority of the Members of Parliament requests dissolution. The action of the president to either suspend or dissolve the Parliament is subject to legal scrutiny of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. The Speaker or, in his absence, the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees or the Deputy Chairman of Committees, presides over Parliament.

==Standing Orders of Parliament==
The Standing Orders of Parliament are the agreed rules under which procedure, debate, and the conduct of Members in the House are regulated. It defines the procedure for the functioning of Parliament, thus becoming an important source of Parliamentary Procedure. Standing Orders have the status of rules under the Constitution, and date back to the first set of Standing Orders adopted by the Legislative Council of Ceylon in 1912, based those of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. These have been changed multiple times and the current set of Standing Orders dates back to 1979. 

==Powers==
Following the Westminster model, all legislation in Sri Lanka must be passed by the Parliament to become law and it controls taxation and the supply of money to the government. Parliament&#x27;s ability to make laws, includes those that have retrospective effect and repealing or amending any provision of the Constitution, or adding any provision to the Constitution. Government ministers must regularly answer questions in Parliament and there are a number of select committees which scrutinize particular issues and the workings of the government.

==Privileges==
Under the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, Parliament and its members are entitled to legal immunity to ensure freedom of speech, freedom from arrest on civil matters and ensure publication of the reports, papers, minutes, votes or proceedings of Parliament. In addition to the privileges laid out in the act, Parliament and its members are entitled to the same parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom. Parliament and any committee can summon any person or request any record or document to be produced before Parliament or the committee.

==History==
The first legislature established in Ceylon was the Executive Council and the legislative council, which were established on 13 March 1833 according to the recommendations of the Colebrook-Cameron commission. The Executive Council was composed of the Colonial Secretary, the officer commanding the Military Forces, the Attorney General, the Auditor-General and the Treasurer. The duties of the council were advisory and the Governor of Ceylon, who presided over their meetings and consulted them, was at liberty to disregard their advice. At first it was made up of only British officials but later included native citizens. At the beginning 16, and later 49 members, were elected for the legislative council, but a limited number of people were qualified to vote.

In 1931 the Legislative Council was dissolved and in its place a more powerful State Council of Ceylon was established, with its 101 members elected by universal adult franchise as provided by the Donoughmore Constitution.

Prior to the granting of independence and the establishment of the Dominion of Ceylon on 4 February 1948, a new bicameral parliament was established in 1947, according to the recommendations of the Soulbury Commission after the State Council was dissolved. It was based on the Westminster model with an upper house, the Senate, whose members were appointed and a lower house of parliament, the House of Representatives, whose members were directly elected. The House of Representatives consisted of 101 members (increased to 157 in 1960) and the Senate consisted of 30 members, 15 of whom were elected by the House of Representatives and 15 nominated by the Governor-General of Ceylon.

The Senate was abolished on 2 October 1971. On 22 May 1972, when the republican constitution was enacted, the House of Representatives was replaced with the National State Assembly, which had 168 elected members. This was then replaced by the Parliament of Sri Lanka, when the current constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka was enacted in 1977.

In 1987, a grenade was lobbed into a conference room inside the Parliament complex where government MPs were meeting. Two people were killed and sixteen were injured, but the target of the attack, President J. R. Jayawardene escaped unharmed. The Marxist–Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna claimed responsibility for the attack.

In 2015, following the parliamentary election, the two major parties of Sri Lanka (the United National Party and Sri Lanka Freedom Party) signed a memorandum of understanding to form a national unity government, in an attempt to address and rectify major unresolved issues following the end of the country&#x27;s 26-year long ethnic conflict. This was the first time in Sri Lanka&#x27;s political history that the two major parties agreed to work together in a joint government. UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, whose party won the most seats, was appointed prime minister, and the joint government lasted until 2018.

==Members and elections==

Of the 225 members of parliament, 196 are elected from 22 electoral districts, which are multi-member. The remaining 29 MPs are elected from National Lists allocated to the parties (and independent groups) in proportion to their share of the national vote.

===Officers===
When Parliament first meets after a general election, it will elect three members to serve as the Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees (known simply as the &quot;Deputy Speaker&quot;) and the Deputy Chairman of Committees. Whilst presiding, the Speaker or Deputy Speaker wears ceremonial dress.

==Parliament Secretariat==
The Parliament Secretariat, headed by the Secretary General of Parliament, is in charge of all its administrative duties. Until 1972, the post was known as &quot;Clerk of Parliament&quot;. The Secretary General is appointed by the President, subject to the approval of the Constitutional Council. The Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for the maintenance of law, order, and security on the House&#x27;s premises and acts also as master-of-ceremonies. The Serjeant-at-Arms carries the ceremonial mace, a symbol of the authority of the People and of the Parliament, into the House each day in front of the Speaker, and the Mace is laid upon the Table of the House during sittings. Currently, the parliament secretariat administration is divided into nine departments.

These departments are:
* Department of Serjeant-at-Arms
* Department of Administration
* Hansard Department
* Department of the Co-ordinating Engineer
* Department of Catering and Housekeeping
* Department of Information Systems and Management
* Department of Legislative Services
* Department of Finance &amp; Supplies
* Department of Communication
The Staff Advisory Committee (SAC) established under the Parliamentary Staff Act provides advice and guidance to the Parliamentary Secretariat with respect to matters concerning Parliamentary staff. The SAC consists of the Speaker (Chairman), the Leader of the House, the Minister of Finance and the Leader of the Opposition. Secretariat maintains the Speaker&#x27;s Residence and the Madiwela Housing Complex for MPs and the nineteen-roomed holiday bungalow for MPs, General&#x27;s House in Nuwara Eliya. Parliament also owns Mumtaz Mahal which was the former residence of the Speaker and Srawasthi Mandiraya the former hostel for MPs. These are now used by other government entities.

==Parliament buildings==


Under the British Colonial government, when the Executive Council and the legislative councils were set up in 1833, they met in a building opposite Gordon Gardens, which is now the &quot;Republic Building&quot;, occupied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 29 January 1930 the British Governor of Ceylon, Sir Herbert Stanley (1927–1931), opened a building fronting the ocean at Galle Face, Colombo, designed for meetings of the Legislative Council. It was subsequently used by the State Council (1931–1947), the House of Representatives (1947–1972), the National State Assembly (1972–1977) and the Parliament of Sri Lanka (1977–1981). Today the Old Parliament Building is used by the Presidential Secretariat.

In 1967 under Speaker Albert F. Peris, the leaders of the political parties unanimously resolved that a new Parliament building be constructed on the opposite side of Beira Lake from the existing Parliament at Galle Face, but no further action was taken. While Stanley Tillekeratne was the Speaker (1970–1977), the leaders of the political parties entrusted the drawing up of plans for a new Parliament building to architects, but the project was subsequently abandoned.

On 4 July 1979, Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa obtained sanction from Parliament to construct a new Parliament Building at &quot;Duwa&quot;, a 5 hectare (12 acre) island in the &quot;Diyawanna Oya&quot; (off Baddegana Road, Pita Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte), about east of Colombo. The island was where the palace of the King Vikramabahu III&#x27;s powerful minister Nissaka Alakesvara had been situated. It had belonged to E. W. Perera prior to being vested in the state.

The building was designed by architect Deshamanya Geoffrey Bawa and built with Sri Lankan funds. On 29 April 1982, the new Parliamentary Complex was declared open by President J. R. Jayewardene.

<doc id="571662" wikidata="Q26283" url="?curid=571662" title="Muskrat">
<text>The muskrat or common muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) is a medium-sized semiaquatic rodent native to North America and an introduced species in parts of Europe, Asia, and South America. 

The muskrat is found in wetlands over various climates and habitats. It has crucial effects on the ecology of wetlands, and is a resource of food and fur for humans.

Adult muskrats weigh , with a body length (excluding the tail) of . They are covered with short, thick fur of medium to dark brown color. Their long tails, covered with scales rather than hair, are laterally compressed and generate a small amount of thrust, with their webbed hind feet being the main means of propulsion, and the unique tail mainly important in directional stability. Muskrats spend most of their time in the water and can swim underwater for 12 to 17 minutes. They live in families of a male and female pair and their young. They build nests to protect themselves from the cold and predators, often burrowed into the bank with an underwater entrance. Muskrats feed mostly on cattail and other aquatic vegetation but also eat small animals.

&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot; is the only extant species in the genus Ondatra; its closest relative is the round-tailed muskrat (&quot;Neofiber alleni&quot;). It is the largest species in the subfamily Arvicolinae, which includes 142 other species of rodents, mostly voles and lemmings. Muskrats are referred to as &quot;rats&quot; in a general sense because they are medium-sized rodents with an adaptable lifestyle and an omnivorous diet. They are not members of the genus &quot;Rattus&quot;. They are not closely related to beavers, with which they share habitat and general appearance.

== Etymology ==
The muskrat&#x27;s name probably comes from a word of Algonquian (possibly Powhatan) origin, &quot;muscascus&quot; (literally &quot;it is red&quot;, so called for its colorings), or from the Abenaki native word &quot;mòskwas&quot;, as seen in the archaic English name for the animal, &quot;musquash&quot;. Because of the association with the &quot;musky&quot; odor, which the muskrat uses to mark its territory, and its flattened tail, the name became altered to musk-beaver; later it became &quot;muskrat&quot; due to its resemblance to rats.

Similarly, its specific name &quot;zibethicus&quot; means &quot;musky&quot;, being the adjective of &quot;zibethus&quot; &quot;civet musk; civet&quot;. The genus name comes from the Huron word for the animal, &quot;ondathra&quot;, and entered Neo-Latin as &quot;Ondatra&quot; via French.

== Description ==
An adult muskrat is about long, half of that length being the tail, and weighs . That is about four times the weight of the brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;), though an adult muskrat is only slightly longer. It is almost certainly the most prominent and heaviest member of the diverse family Cricetidae, which includes all voles, lemmings, and most mice native to the Americas, and hamsters in Eurasia. The muskrat is much smaller than a beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), with which they often share a habitat.

Muskrats are covered with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the animal ages, it turns partly gray. The fur has two layers, which protect it from cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair. To aid in swimming, their tails are slightly flattened vertically, a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.

Muskrats spend most of their time in water and are well suited to their semiaquatic life. They can swim underwater for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less sensitive to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep water out. Their hind feet are partially webbed and are their primary means of propulsion. Their tail functions as a rudder, controlling the direction they swim.

== Distribution and ecology ==
Muskrats are found in most of Canada, the United States, and a small part of northern Mexico. They were introduced to Europe at the beginning of the 20th century and have become an invasive species in northwestern Europe. They primarily inhabit wetlands, areas in or near saline and freshwater wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds. They are not found in Florida, where the round-tailed muskrat, or Florida water rat (&quot;Neofiber alleni&quot;), fills their ecological niche.

Their populations naturally cycle; in areas where they become abundant, they can remove much of the vegetation in wetlands. They are thought to play a major role in determining the vegetation of prairie wetlands in particular. They also selectively remove preferred plant species, thereby changing the abundance of plant species in many kinds of wetlands. Species commonly eaten include cattail and yellow water lily. Alligators are thought to be an important natural predator, and the absence of muskrats from Florida may, in part, be the result of alligator predation.

While much wetland habitat has been eliminated due to human activity, new muskrat habitat has been created by the construction of canals or irrigation channels (e.g., acequias), and the muskrat remains widespread. They can live alongside streams that contain the sulfurous water that drains away from coal mines. Fish and frogs perish in such streams, yet muskrats may thrive and occupy the wetlands. Muskrats also benefit from human persecution of some of their predators.

The muskrat is classed as a &quot;prohibited new organism&quot; under New Zealand&#x27;s Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing it from being imported into the country.

The trematode &quot;Metorchis conjunctus&quot; can also infect muskrats.

===Decline in the United States===
According to an April 2024 article in &quot;Hakai Magazine&quot;, the muskrat populations have declined by at least one-half in 34 US states. The collapse was near-total, between 90 and 99 percent in a handful of states. Rhode Island&#x27;s muskrat populations are estimated to be roughly 15 percent of what they were several decades ago.
The decline in muskrat populations began in the 1990s and early 2000s.

== Subspecies ==

&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot; has 16 subspecies: &quot;O.z. albus&quot;, &quot;O.z. aquihnis&quot;, &quot;O.z. bemardi&quot;, &quot;O.z. cinnamominus&quot;, &quot;O.z. macrodom&quot;, &quot;O.z. mergens&quot;, &quot;O.z. obscurus&quot;, &quot;O.z. occipitalis&quot;, &quot;O.z. osoyoosensis&quot;, &quot;O.z. pallidus&quot;, &quot;O.z.ripensis&quot;, &quot;O.z. rivalicus&quot;, &quot;O.z. roidmani&quot;, &quot;O.z. spatulatus&quot;, &quot;O.z. zalaphus&quot; and &quot;O.z. zibethicus&quot;.

== Invasiveness status ==
In Europe, the muskrat has been included in the list of invasive alien species of Union concern (the Union list) since August 2, 2017. This implies that this species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union. Muskrats were introduced to Europe in the early 20th century for fur farming. In many European countries, muskrats have become problematic, damaging flood control systems, crops, and river banks with burrowing activities. Their presence is particularly concerning in areas with delicate ecosystems, where they can outcompete or displace native species. Several European countries have implemented control measures and eradication programs to manage muskrat populations and mitigate their impact.

== Behavior ==

Muskrats normally live in families consisting of a male and female and their young. During the spring, they often fight with other muskrats over territory and potential mates. Many are injured or killed in these fights. Muskrat families build nests to protect themselves and their young from cold and predators. Muskrats burrow into the bank with an underwater entrance in streams, ponds, or lakes. These entrances are wide. In marshes, push-ups are constructed from vegetation and mud. These push-ups are up to in height. In snowy areas, they keep the openings to their push-ups closed by plugging them with vegetation, which they replace daily. Some muskrat push-ups are swept away in spring floods and must be replaced yearly. Muskrats also build feeding platforms constructed in the water from cut pieces of vegetation supported by a branch structure. They help maintain open areas in marshes, which helps to provide habitat for aquatic birds.

Muskrats are most active at night or near dawn and dusk. They feed on cattails and other aquatic vegetation. They do not store food for the winter, but sometimes eat the insides of their push-ups. While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored, more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist, as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife documentary &quot;The Life of Mammals&quot;. Plant materials compose about 95% of their diets, but they also eat small animals, such as freshwater mussels, frogs, crayfish, fish, and small turtles. Muskrats follow trails they make in swamps and ponds. They continue to follow their trails under the ice when the water freezes. 

Muskrats provide an important food resource for many other animals, including mink, red and gray foxes, cougars, coyotes, wolves, boreal lynx, Canada lynx, bobcats, raccoons, brown and black bears, wolverines, eagles, hawks, large owls, snakes, alligators, and bull sharks. Otters, snapping turtles, herons, bullfrogs, large fish such as pike and largemouth bass, and predatory land reptiles such as monitor lizards prey on baby muskrats. Caribou, moose, and elk sometimes feed on the vegetation which makes up muskrat push-ups during the winter when other food is scarce for them. In their introduced range in the former Soviet Union, the muskrat&#x27;s greatest predator is the golden jackal. They can be completely eradicated in shallow water bodies. During the winter of 1948–49 in the Amu Darya (river in central Asia), muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal feces contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals, 16% of which froze and became unsuitable for muskrat occupation. Jackals also harm the muskrat industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.

Muskrats, like most rodents, are prolific breeders. Females can have two or three litters a year of six to eight young each. The babies are born small and hairless and weigh only about . In southern environments, young muskrats mature in six months, while in colder northern environments, it takes about a year. Muskrat populations appear to go through a regular pattern of rise and dramatic decline spread over a six- to 10-year period. Some other rodents, including famously the muskrat&#x27;s close relatives, such as the lemmings, go through the same type of population changes.

== In human history ==
Native Americans have long considered the muskrat to be an important animal. Some predict winter snowfall levels by observing the size and timing of muskrat lodge construction.

In several Native American creation myths, the muskrat dives to the bottom of the primordial sea to bring up the mud from which the earth is created after other animals have failed in the task.

Muskrats have sometimes been a food resource for North Americans. In the southeastern portion of Michigan, a longstanding dispensation allows Catholics to consume muskrat as their Friday penance, on Ash Wednesday, and on Lenten Fridays (when the eating of flesh, except for fish, is prohibited); this tradition dates back to at least the early 19th century. In 2019, it was reported that a series of muskrat dinners were held during Lent in the areas along the Detroit River, with up to 900 muskrats being consumed at a single dinner. The preparation involved the removal of the musk glands and the gutting and cleaning of the carcass before the meat was parboiled for four hours with onion and garlic and finally fried.

Muskrat fur is warm, becoming prime in northern North America at the beginning of December. In the early 20th century, the trapping of the animal for its fur became an important industry there. During that era, the fur was specially trimmed and dyed to be sold widely in the US as &quot;Hudson seal&quot; fur. Muskrats were introduced at that time to Europe as a fur resource and spread throughout northern Europe and Asia.

In some European countries, such as Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, the muskrat is considered an invasive pest, as its burrowing damages the dikes and levees on which these low-lying countries depend for protection from flooding. In those countries, it is trapped, poisoned, and hunted to attempt to keep the population down. Muskrats also eat corn and other farm and garden crops growing near water bodies.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police winter hats are made from muskrat fur.

<text>phpMyAdmin is a free and open source administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB. As a portable web application written primarily in PHP, it has become one of the most popular MySQL administration tools, especially for web hosting services.

==History==
Tobias Ratschiller, then an IT consultant and later founder of the software company Maguma, started to work on a PHP-based web front-end to MySQL in 1998, inspired by MySQL-Webadmin. He gave up the project (and phpAdsNew, of which he was also the original author) in 2000 because of lack of time.

By that time, phpMyAdmin had already become one of the most popular PHP applications and MySQL administration tools, with a large community of users and contributors. In order to coordinate the growing number of patches, a group of three developers (Olivier Müller, Marc Delisle and Loïc Chapeaux) registered &quot;The phpMyAdmin Project&quot; at SourceForge and took over the development in 2001.

In July 2015, the main website and the downloads left SourceForge and moved to a content delivery network. At the same time, the releases began to be PGP-signed. Afterwards, issue tracking moved to GitHub and the mailing lists migrated. Before version 4, which uses Ajax extensively to enhance usability, the software used HTML frames.

==Features==
Features provided by the program include:
# Web interface
# MySQL and MariaDB database management
# Import data from CSV, JSON and SQL
# Export data to various formats: CSV, SQL, XML, JSON, PDF (via the TCPDF library), ISO/IEC 26300 - OpenDocument Text and Spreadsheet, Word, Excel, LaTeX, SQL, and others
# Administering multiple servers
# Creating PDF graphics of the database layout
# Creating complex queries using query-by-example (QBE)
# Searching globally in a database or a subset of it
# Transforming stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions, like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link
# Live charts to monitor MySQL server activity like connections, processes, CPU/memory usage, etc.
# Network traffic to the SQL server
# Working with different operating systems like Windows*, Linux*, OS/2, Free BSD* Unix* (such as Sun* Solaris*, AIX) and others.
# Make complex SQL queries easier.

<text>Širvintos () is a city in Vilnius County in eastern Lithuania. It is the administrative center of the Širvintos district municipality.

== Etymology ==
The town&#x27;s name is a place name derived from the river Širvinta, which flows through it. Širvinta river name itself derives from the adjective &quot;širvas&quot;, which refers to the grey colour of the Širvinta river waters. In the interwar period, the town was known as &quot;Širvintai&quot;.

Folk etymology also relates the name to the word &quot;širvis&quot;, which is used to refer to a moose because of the colour of its fur. This is also reflected in the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

In other languages Širvintos is referred to as: ; 

== History ==

The first church in Širvintos was constructed in 1475, and by 1559, Širvintos had evolved into a small town. In 1641, Širvintos was under the ownership of Mikalojus Kiška II, the Elder of Ukmergė. In 1746, the ruler of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Augustus III, granted permission to Mykolas Eperješas, the Elder of Širvintos, to organise weekly markets and fairs. In 1765, the town was home to 15 households. During the latter half of the eighteenth century, a parish school was established. In 1782, the town held three seasonal fairs, and at the end of the 18th century, horse markets were recorded. In 1830-1831, during the November Uprising that swept across the former Commonwealth, the rebel government of Vilnius County was established in Širvintos.

In the latter half of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth century, Širvintos served as the administrative centre for a district. During the January Uprising of 1863-1864, the rebels in Širvintos destroyed the records and documents belonging to the Russian authorities. In 1881, in addition to the Catholic church, there was a synagogue. During this period, a post office was also established. Furthermore, in 1883, three companies of the Russian Imperial Army were stationed in Širvintos. In 1897, the town had three synagogues, a brewery, 34 commercial establishments, and a pharmacy. In 1903, the Širvintos Consumers&#x27; Society was established, and construction of an Orthodox church commenced. 

On 11 November 1920, the Lithuanian army recaptured Širvintos from Lucjan Żeligowski&#x27;s forces, which had already occupied Vilnius and were advancing further into Lithuanian territory in the direction of Ukmergė. Following a series of intense clashes during the Battle of Giedraičiai, the Polish army was ultimately forced to retreat. It is contended by historians that Lithuania&#x27;s independence was successfully defended at Širvintos and Giedraičiai. In commemoration of the battles that took place there, a monument to the fallen Lithuanian soldiers was erected in August 1927. The monument was funded by the public and was created by the sculptor Robertas Antinis. The monument was dismantled in 1954 by the Soviet authorities and subsequently reconstructed in 1991 following Lithuania&#x27;s independence. From 1920 to 1923, Širvintos functioned as a neutral zone between the Lithuanian and Polish militaries. In 1929, an electric power station was commissioned. In 1927, a branch of the Union for the Liberation of Vilnius and a Lithuanian Riflemen&#x27;s Union were established. In 1935, a branch of the Pavasarininkai was formed, and in 1937, a branch of the Society for the Beautification of Lithuania was inaugurated.

During World War II, the town was occupied by the Soviet Union from 1940, then by Nazi Germany from 1941, and once again by the Soviet Union from 1944. Before the war, the town had an important Jewish community representing one-third of the total population. In September 1941, Jews of the town are murdered in mass executions perpetrated by Germans and Lithuanian collaborators.

On 6 October 2016, a monument to Ignas Šeinius, a writer and diplomat hailing from Širvintos, was inaugurated in the town&#x27;s central avenue. The monument was designed by sculptor Henrikas Orakauskas.

In June 2024, a monument to a poet and playwright Justinas Marcinkevičius was unveiled in the Youth Garden of Širvintos. The sculpture was erected just a few metres from the rotunda on which Marcinkevičius&#x27; poem is inscribed. The author of the sculpture is Alvyda Pažusienė.

<text>A dragline excavator is a heavy-duty excavator used in civil engineering and surface mining. It was invented in 1904, and presented an immediate challenge to the steam shovel and its diesel and electric powered descendant, the power shovel. Much more efficient than even the largest of the latter, it enjoyed a heyday in extreme size for most of the 20th century, first becoming challenged by more efficient rotary excavators in the 1950s, then superseded by them on the upper end from the 1970s on.

The largest ever walking dragline was Big Muskie, a Bucyrus-Erie 4250-W put online in 1969 that swung a , 325 ton capacity bucket, had a boom, and weighed 13,500 tons.

The largest walking dragline produced as of 2014 was Joy Global’s digital AC drive control P&amp;H 9020XPC, which has a bucket capacity of and boom lengths ranging from ; working weights vary between 7,539 and 8,002 tons.

==Types==
Draglines fall into two broad categories: those that are based on standard, lifting cranes, and the heavy units which have to be built on-site. Most crawler cranes, with an added winch drum on the front, can act as a dragline. These units (like other cranes) are designed to be temporarily dismantled and transported over the road on flatbed trailers. Draglines used in most civil engineering are of this smaller, crane type. These are used for road construction, port construction, pond and canal dredging, and as pile driving rigs. These types are built by crane manufacturers such as Link-Belt and Hyster.

The much larger type which is erected on site is commonly used in strip-mining operations to remove overburden above coal and more recently for oil sands mining. The largest heavy draglines are among the largest mobile land machines ever built, weighing up to 13,500 tons, while the smallest and most common of the site-erected type weigh around 8,000 tons.

A dragline bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a large truss-like boom (or mast) with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered by means of a number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The dragrope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuver of the hoist and the dragropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. A schematic of a large dragline bucket system is shown below.

==History==
The dragline was invented in 1904 by John W. Page (as a partner of the firm Page &amp; Schnable Contracting) for use in digging the Chicago Canal. By 1912, Page realized that building draglines was more lucrative than contracting, so he created the Page Engineering Company to build draglines. Page built its first crude walking dragline in 1923. These used legs operated by rack and pinion on a separate frame that lifted the crane. The body was then pulled forward by chain on a roller track and then lowered again. Page developed the first diesel engines exclusively for dragline application in 1924. Page also invented the arched dragline bucket, a design still commonly used today by draglines from many other manufacturers, and in the 1960s pioneered an archless bucket design. With its walking mechanism badly behind that of competitor Monighan (see below), Page updated their mechanism to an eccentric drive in 1935. This much improved mechanism gave a proper elliptical motion and was used until 1988. Page modernized its draglines further with the 700 series in 1954. Page&#x27;s largest dragline was the Model 757 delivered to the Obed Mine near Hinton, Alberta in 1983. It featured a 75-yard bucket on a 298-foot boom and an operating weight of 4,500 tons. In 1988, Harnischfeger Corporation (P&amp;H Mining Equipment) purchased Page Engineering Company.

Harnischfeger Corporation was established as P&amp;H Mining in 1884 by Alonzo Pawling and Henry Harnischfeger. In 1914, P&amp;H introduced the world&#x27;s first gasoline engine powered dragline. In 1988, Page was acquired by Harnischfeger which makes the P&amp;H line of shovels, draglines, and cranes. P&amp;H&#x27;s largest dragline is the 9030C with a 160-yard bucket and up to a 425-foot boom.

In 1907, Monighan&#x27;s Machine Works of Chicago became interested in manufacturing draglines when local contractor John W. Page placed an order for hoisting machinery to install one. In 1908, Monighan changed its name to the Monighan Machine Company. In 1913, a Monighan engineer named Oscar Martinson invented the first walking mechanism for a dragline. The device, known as the Martinson Tractor, was installed on a Monighan dragline, creating the first walking dragline. This gave Monighan a significant advantage over other draglines and the company prospered. The cam mechanism was further improved in 1925 by eliminating the drag chains for the shoes and changing to a cam wheel running in an oval track. This gave the shoe a proper elliptical motion. The first dragline using the new mechanism was the 3-W available in 1926. So popular were these machines that the name Monighan became a generic term for dragline. In the early 1930s, Bucyrus-Erie began purchasing shares of Monighan stock with Monighan&#x27;s approval. Bucyrus purchased a controlling interest and the joint company became known as Bucyrus-Monighan until the formal merger in 1946. The first walking dragline excavator in the United Kingdom was used at the Wellingborough iron quarry in 1940.

Ransomes &amp; Rapier was founded in 1869 by four engineers to build railway equipment and other heavy works. In 1914 they started building two small steam shovels as a result of a customer request. The rope-operated crowd system they built for this was patented and later sold to Bucyrus. After WWI, demand for excavators increased and in 1924 they reached an agreement to build Marion draglines from 1 to 8 cubic yards capacity. In 1927, they built Type-7 1-yard and Type-460 1.5-yard models. The deal to build Marion machines ended in 1936. R&amp;R began building their own designs with the Type-4120 followed by the 4140 of 3.5 cubic yards. In 1958 the Ramsomes &amp; Rapier division was sold to Newton, Chambers &amp; Co. of Sheffield, which was combined with their NCK Crane &amp; Excavator division. This became NCK-Rapier. The walking dragline division of NCK-Rapier was acquired by Bucyrus in 1988.

The Marion Power Shovel Company (established in 1880) built its first walking dragline with a simple single-crank mechanism in 1939. Its largest dragline was the 8950 sold to Amax Coal Company in 1973. It featured a 150-cubic yard bucket on a 310-foot boom and weighed 7,300 tons. Marion was acquired by Bucyrus in 1997.

Bucyrus Foundry and Manufacturing Company entered the dragline market in 1910 with the purchase of manufacturing rights for the Heyworth-Newman dragline excavator. Their &quot;Class 14&quot; dragline was introduced in 1911 as the first crawler mounted dragline. In 1912 Bucyrus helped pioneer the use of electricity as a power source for large stripping shovels and draglines used in mining. An Italian company, Fiorentini, produced dragline excavators from 1919 licensed by Bucyrus. After the merger with Monighan in 1946, Bucyrus began producing much larger machines using the Monighan walking mechanism such as the 800 ton 650-B which used a 15-yard bucket. Bucyrus&#x27; largest dragline was Big Muskie built for the Ohio Coal Company in 1969. This machine featured a 220-yard bucket on a 450-foot boom and weighed 14,500 tons. Bucyrus was itself acquired by heavy equipment and diesel engine maker, Caterpillar, in 2011. Caterpillar&#x27;s largest dragline is the 8750 with a 169-yard bucket, 435-foot boom, and 8,350 ton weight.

The market for draglines began shrinking rapidly after the boom of the 1960s and 1970s which led to more mergers. P&amp;H&#x27;s acquisition of Page in 1988 along with Bucyrus&#x27; acquisition of Ransomes &amp; Rapier in 1988 and Marion in 1997 cut the number of worldwide suppliers of heavy draglines by more than half. Today, P&amp;H and Caterpillar are the only remaining manufacturers of large draglines.

===Other manufacturers===

Heavy Engineering Corporation Limited was the first Indian company to manufacture a walking dragline of 31-yard bucket capacity. HEC makes up to a 44-yard bucket. For comparison, this would be comparable to Caterpillar&#x27;s Small Draglines 8000 series with a 42-yard bucket. HEC has supplied fifteen draglines to the Indian mining industry.

==Operation==
In a typical cycle of excavation, the bucket is positioned above the material to be excavated. The bucket is then lowered and the dragrope is then drawn so that the bucket is dragged along the surface of the material. The bucket is then lifted by using the hoist rope. A swing operation is then performed to move the bucket to the place where the material is to be dumped. The dragrope is then released causing the bucket to tilt and empty. This is called a dump operation.

On crane-type draglines, the bucket can also be &#x27;thrown&#x27; by winding up to the jib and then releasing a clutch on the drag cable. This would then swing the bucket like a pendulum. Once the bucket had passed the vertical, the hoist cable would be released thus throwing the bucket. On smaller draglines, a skilled operator could make the bucket land about one-half the length of the jib further away than if it had just been dropped. On larger draglines, this is not a common practice.

==Draglines in mining==
A large dragline system used in the open pit mining industry costs approximately US$50–100 million. A typical bucket has a volume ranging from 40 to 80 cubic yards (30 to 60 cubic metres), though extremely large buckets have ranged up to 220 cubic yards (168 cubic meters). The length of the boom ranges from . In a single cycle, it can move up to 450 tons of material.

Most mining draglines are not diesel-powered like most other mining equipment. Their power consumption on order of several megawatts is so great that they have a direct connection to the high-voltage grid at voltages of between 6.6 and 22 kV. A typical dragline weighing 4000 to 6000 tons, with a 55-cubic-metre bucket, can use up to 6 megawatts during normal digging operations. Because of this, many (possibly apocryphal) stories have been told about the blackout-causing effects of mining draglines. For instance, there is a long-lived story that, back in the 1970s, if all seven draglines at Peak Downs Mine (a very large BHP coal mine in central Queensland, Australia) turned on simultaneously, they would black out all of North Queensland. However even in the 2000s if they have been shut down, they are always restarted one at a time due to the immense power requirements of startup.
In all but the smallest of draglines, movement is accomplished by &quot;walking&quot; using feet or pontoons, as caterpillar tracks place too much pressure on the ground, and have great difficulty under the immense weight of the dragline. Maximum speed is only at most a few metres per minute, since the feet must be repositioned for each step. If travelling medium distances (about 30–100 km), a special dragline carrier can be brought in to transport the dragline. Above that distance, disassembly is generally required. But mining draglines due to their reach can work a large area from one position and do not need to constantly move along the face like smaller machines.

==Limitations==
The primary limitations of draglines are their boom height and boom length, which limits where the dragline can dump the waste material. Another primary limitation is their dig depth, which is limited by the length of rope the dragline can utilize. Inherent with their construction, a dragline is most efficient excavating material below the level of their base. While a dragline can dig above itself, it does so inefficiently and is not suitable to load piled up material (as a rope shovel or wheel loader can).

Despite their limitations, and their extremely high capital cost, draglines remain popular with many mines, due to their reliability, and extremely low waste removal cost.

==Notable examples==

The coal mining dragline known as Big Muskie, owned by the Central Ohio Coal Company (a division of American Electric Power), was the world&#x27;s largest mobile earth-moving machine, weighing 13,500 tons and standing nearly 22 stories tall. It operated in Muskingum County, in the U.S. state of Ohio from 1969 to 1991, and derived power from a 13,800 volt electrical supply. It was dismantled for $700,000 worth of recycled metal in 1999.

The British firm of Ransomes &amp; Rapier produced a few diesel-electric excavators rather over 1/10th its size, the largest in Europe in the 1960s at 1400-1800 tons. One, named &quot;SUNDEW&quot;, was used in a quarry from 1957 to 1974. After its working life at the first site in Rutland wrapped it walked in 9 weeks to Corby, where it continued on till being scrapped from January to June 1987.

Smaller draglines were also commonly used before hydraulic excavators came into common use, the smaller draglines are now rarely used other than on river and gravel pit works. The small machines were of a mechanical drive with clutches. Firms such as Ruston and Bucyrus made models such as the RB10 which were popular for small building works and drainage work. Several of these can still be seen in the English Fens of Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and parts of Norfolk. Ruston&#x27;s are a company also associated with drainage pumping engines. Electric drive systems were only used on the larger mining machines, most modern machines use a diesel-hydraulic drive, as machines are seldom in one location long enough to justify the cost of installing a substation and supply cables.

==Technological advances==

The basic mechanical technology of draglines, unlike that of most equipment used in earth-moving, has remained relatively unchanged in design and control functions for almost 100 years. Some advances, however, have been made (such as hydraulic, then electro-hydraulic, controls (including joysticks) and using simulation software to train new operators), are being pursued (such as improved automation systems), or are arguable as a step forward (as is &quot;universal dig-dump&quot; (UDD)):

===Automation===
Researchers at CSIRO in Australia have a long-term research project into automating draglines. Mining automation teams at QCAT, a CSIRO division; have been developing the automation technology since 1994. Automated systems include cruise control and Digital Terrain Mapping. Working solutions include the proof-of-concept dragline swing cruise control on a Tarong BE1370.

===Simulation software===
Since draglines are typically large, complicated and very expensive, training new operators can be a tricky process. In the same way that flight simulators have developed to train pilots, mining simulator software has been developed to assist new operators in learning how to control the machines.

===UDD===
UDD stands for &quot;universal dig-dump&quot;. It represents the first fundamental change to draglines for almost a century, since the invention of the &#x27;miracle hitch&#x27;. Instead of using two ropes (the hoist rope and the drag rope) to manipulate the bucket, a UDD machine uses four ropes, two hoist and two drag. This allows the dragline operator to have much greater selectivity in when to pick up the bucket, and in how the bucket may be dumped. UDD machines generally have higher productivity than a standard dragline, but often have greater mechanical issues. Within the mining industry, there is still much debate as to whether UDD improvements justify their costs.

<doc id="571675" wikidata="Q3067228" url="?curid=571675" title="Press Complaints Commission">
<text>The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) was a voluntary regulatory body for British printed newspapers and magazines, consisting of representatives of the major publishers. The PCC closed on Monday 8 September 2014, and was replaced by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), chaired by Sir Alan Moses. Unlike the UK&#x27;s only &#x27;Approved Regulator&#x27; Independent Monitor for the Press (IMPRESS) who are fully compliant with the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry, IPSO has refused to seek approval to the Press Recognition Panel (PRP).

The PCC was funded by the annual levy it charged newspapers and magazines. It had no legal powers – all newspapers and magazines voluntarily contributed to the costs of, and adhered to the rulings of, the commission, making the industry self-regulating.

The PCC received extensive criticism for its lack of action in the News of the World phone hacking affair, including from MPs and Prime Minister David Cameron, who called for it to be replaced with a new system in July 2011. The Leveson Inquiry was set up and reported in November 2012 but there since has been deadlock over its proposals for self-regulation despite the establishment of a Royal Charter on self-regulation of the press.

Lord Hunt was appointed Chairman of the Commission in October 2011.
In December 2011 Lord Hunt announced his plans to replace the PCC with a new independent regulator.

Hunt also wants to introduce a voluntary, paid-for, &#x27;kitemarking&#x27; system for blogs. The kitemark would indicate that the blogger has agreed to strive for accuracy, and to be regulated. Bloggers would lose their kitemark if complaints against them were repeatedly upheld. He plans to start the roll-out by targeting bloggers that cover current affairs.

When asked about his proposals in an interview Hunt said &quot;At the moment, it is like the Wild West out there. We need to appoint a sheriff.&quot;

==Chairs==
* Lord McGregor of Durris (1991–1994)
* Lord Wakeham (1995–2002)
* Professor Robert Pinker (2002)
* Sir Christopher Meyer (2003–2009)
* Baroness Buscombe (2009–2011)
* Lord Hunt of Wirral (2011–2014)

==History==

The precursor to the PCC was the Press Council, a voluntary press organisation founded in 1953 with the aim of maintaining high standards of ethics in journalism. However, in the late 1980s, several newspapers breached these standards and others were unsatisfied with the effectiveness of the council. The Home Office thus set up a departmental committee, headed by Sir David Calcutt, to investigate whether a body with formal legal powers should be created to regulate the industry.

The report, published in June 1990, concluded that a voluntary body, with a full, published code of conduct should be given eighteen months to prove its effectiveness. Should it fail, the report continued, a legally empowered body would replace it. Members of the press, keen to avoid external regulation, established the Press Complaints Commission and its Code of Practice.

The first high-profile case handled by the PCC was brought by the Duke of York who claimed that the press were invading the privacy of his small children. The complaint was upheld.

The commission&#x27;s first chairman was Lord McGregor of Durris. He was succeeded by Lord Wakeham in 1995. He resigned in January 2002 after concerns over a conflict of interest when the Enron Corporation collapsed. He had been a member of the company&#x27;s audit committee. Sir Christopher Meyer was appointed in 2002 following a brief period of interim chairmanship by Professor Robert Pinker, leaving in 2008.

In 2006, the PCC received 3,325 complaints from members of the public. Around two-thirds of these were related to alleged factual inaccuracies, one in five related to alleged invasions of privacy and the rest included the lack of right to reply, harassment and obtaining information using covert devices. 90% of cases were resolved to the complainants&#x27; satisfaction. 31 of the cases were adjudicated by the commission before being resolved as the complainants were initially not satisfied by the action recommended by the commission.

In 2009 the PCC received more than 25,000 complaints, a record number, after an article appeared in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; written by Jan Moir about the death of Boyzone singer Stephen Gately. Moir had described events leading up the death as &quot;sleazy&quot; and &quot;less than respectable&quot;. On 17 February the PCC confirmed that although it was &quot;uncomfortable with the tenor of the columnist&#x27;s remarks&quot;, it would not uphold the complaints made.

As of 12 January 2011, the Northern and Shell group (often referred to as the Express Group) of publications withdrew its subscription to the PCC. According to the PCC, &quot;a refusal to support the self-regulatory system financially means that a newspaper publisher effectively withdraws from the PCC&#x27;s formal jurisdiction, which the PCC considers regrettable&quot;. Consequently, the Daily &amp; Sunday Express, Scottish Daily &amp; Sunday Express, Daily &amp; Sunday Star, OK!, New magazine and Star magazine are no longer bound by the PCC&#x27;s code of practice, and the public no longer has recourse to making complaints through the PCC.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper reported in May 2011 that social media messages are to be brought under the remit of the PCC after it ruled in February 2011 that information posted on Twitter should be considered public and publishable by newspapers.

==The Code of Practice==
Any member of the public, whether a relative unknown or a high-profile figure, is able to bring a complaint against a publication that had volunteered to meet the standards of the Code. Members of the Commission adjudicate whether the Code has indeed been broken, and, if so, suggest appropriate measures of correction. These have included the printing of a factual correction, an apology or letters from the original complainant. The Commission does not impose financial penalties on newspapers found to have broken the Code.

Many publishers have added clauses to the contracts of editors of newspapers and magazines giving them the option to dismiss editors who are judged to have breached the PCC Code of Practice. The PCC and its adherents claim that by attaching personal significance to the role of the PCC in the editors&#x27; mind, its role has become more effective.

The section titles of the code of practice on which judgements are made are as follows:

It is worth noting that reporting restrictions imposed by judges take precedence over the PCC&#x27;s code. For example, under the Sexual Offences Act 1992, victims (even alleged victims) of sexual offences have lifetime anonymity. This means that a newspaper cannot print any particulars leading to the identification of a sexual offence victim.

==Criticism==
In 2001, Labour MP Clive Soley said that &quot;other regulatory bodies are far stronger, far more pro-active and really do represent the consumer. There are no consumer rights people on the PCC and that is a major failing&quot;.

Journalist Nick Davies criticised the PCC for failing to investigate the vast majority of complaints on technical grounds in his book &quot;Flat Earth News&quot; (2008), an exposé of modern British newspaper journalism.

===Phone hacking===
In February 2010 the commission was described as &quot;toothless&quot; by the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select committee investigating the News of the World phone hacking affair.

In a press conference on 8 July 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron described the PCC as &#x27;inadequate&#x27; and &#x27;absent&#x27; during the phone hacking affair.

===Self-regulation===
The 2009 British investigative documentary &quot;Starsuckers&quot; exposed the request to obtain medical records of celebrities by many of the red-top UK tabloids, and the lack of PCC action against the papers that had broken the PCC charter. The tabloids ran the bogus stories about the likes of Amy Winehouse, Pixie Geldof and Guy Ritchie. Secretly interviewed reporters claimed that &quot;the PCC is run by the newspaper Editors&quot;, &quot;Getting a PCC isn&#x27;t great, but, a lot of papers just brush it aside, all it is, is a little apology somewhere in the paper, you get a slap on the wrist, you get reported by the PCC, but there&#x27;s no money&quot;. The PCC took no action against the papers that ran these stories but did respond with a letter to the Editor of &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot;. The response of Chris Atkins, the documentary&#x27;s director, was that the PCC had yet still not acted on the issue of several newspapers breaking their Code of conduct 8.2.

===Funding===

On 24 August 2011, the New Left Project published an article by Julian Petley, arguing that the PCC is &quot;not, and never has been, a regulator&quot;: he presents the case that the PCC is the equivalent of the customer services department of any large corporate organisation, responding to customer complaints for most of the British press. The PCC responded to this article on their own website, stating that the PCC is a regulatory organisation which very regularly intervenes &quot;proactively and pre-publication to prevent tabloid and broadsheet stories appearing&quot;. Jonathan Collett said that this method has an &quot;almost 100% success rate&quot;. Petley responded to Collett in the New Left Project on 26 August 2011, stating that the PCC &quot;lacks sufficient sanctions to be able to punish effectively those who breach its Code&quot; and that the problem is not the PCC but its funding.

<text>The British Rail Class 01 diesel locomotive is a short wheelbase 0-4-0 diesel-mechanical design intended for use in areas with tight curves and limited clearance.

==History==
Four examples were built by Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co. of Kilmarnock (Scotland) in 1956. They were numbered 11503–11506, then D2953–2956, and two survived long enough to become 01001 (D2954) and 01002 (D2955) on the TOPS system. Their original depot allocation was to Stratford (30A). A fifth locomotive with detail differences was built in 1958 for departmental use at Peterborough Permanent Way Depot. It was originally No. 81 but was renumbered D2956 in July 1967 after the original D2956 had been withdrawn. 

The locomotives were very versatile, despite having only available, and were small enough to operate on any railway on the BR standard gauge network, limited only by their low top speed of . They were also very reliable for such a small class, although Stratford Docks, where they originally worked, was not noted for having much use for them. Two examples, D2953 and D2956, were sold in 1966 and a third locomotive (the second D2956) followed in 1968.

D2954 and D2955 survived in BR service because they were required to service the Holyhead Breakwater, being the only locomotives light enough for that track, the pair were used by William Wild &amp; Sons Ltd. They were renumbered 01001 and 01002 under TOPS. 01001 was not used after 1973 but was cannibalised for spare parts to keep its sister loco in service. 01001 was withdrawn in 1979, and 01002 followed in 1981. 01002 had last run when the Breakwater Railway closed in July 1980. Both locomotives were cut up on site still carrying their original livery of British Railways black with black-and-yellow &quot;wasp stripe&quot; warning ends and the original British Railways &quot;unicycling lion&quot; emblem; they were the last locomotives in BR service to do so.

==Technical details==
Class 01 locomotives had a Gardner 6-cylinder in-line, 4-stroke 6L3 engine of 153 hp (114 kW) at 1,200 rpm connected to a Wilson SE4, 4-speed epicyclic gear box with a Vulcan-Sinclair type 23 rigid hydraulic coupling, and a Wiseman 15LGB reverse and final drive unit. The wheels were connected by coupling rods and driven by a jackshaft.

==Preservation==
Two pre-TOPS members survive in preservation:
* D2953 by Heritage Shunters Trust at Rowsley South, Peak Rail
* the first D2956 on the East Lancashire Railway

==Re-use of the &#x27;01&#x27; TOPS code==

More recently, the sub-classification 01/5 has come into use to refer to small, privately owned shunters certified to run on the national network. As such, 01/5 is a collective grouping of a number of very different locomotives, having in common only that they are small, hitherto unclassified shunters of designs never given a BR classification.

<doc id="571678" wikidata="Q28195" url="?curid=571678" title="Helichrysum">
<text>The genus Helichrysum consists of an estimated 600 species of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The type species is &quot;Helichrysum orientale&quot;. They often go by the names everlasting, immortelle, and strawflower. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words (helios, sun) and (, gold).

It occurs in Africa (with 244 species in South Africa), Madagascar, Australasia and Eurasia. The plants may be annuals, herbaceous perennials or shrubs, growing to a height of . The genus was a wastebasket taxon, and many of its members have been reclassified in smaller genera, most notably the Everlastings, now in the genus &quot;Xerochrysum&quot;.

Their leaves are oblong to lanceolate. They are flat and pubescent on both sides. The bristles of the pappus are scabrous, barbellate, or plumose.

The receptacle (&quot;base of the flower head&quot;) is often smooth, with a fringed margin, or honey-combed, and resemble daisies. They may be in almost all colors, except blue. There are many capitula and generally flat-topped corymbs or panicles. The corolla lobes show glandular hairs at the abaxial surface.

&quot;Helichrysum&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the bucculaticid leaf-miners &quot;Bucculatrix gnaphaliella&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;Helichrysum arenarium&quot;) and &quot;Bucculatrix helichrysella&quot; (feeds exclusively on &quot;H. italicum&quot;) and the &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers &quot;C. caelebipennella&quot;, &quot;C. gnaphalii&quot; (feeds exclusively on &quot;H arenarium&quot;) and &quot;C. helichrysiella&quot; (feeds exclusively on &quot;H. italicum&quot;).

==Species==

Hilliard (1983) divided this large and heterogeneous genus in 30 morphological groups. But the genus remains controversial and is considered by many to be an artificial genus. The taxonomy of this large polymorphic and probably polyphyletic genus is complex and not yet satisfactorily resolved. Several Australian species, such as &quot;H. acuminatum&quot; and &quot;H. bracteatum&quot;, have been reclassified in the genus &quot;Xerochrysum&quot; in 1991, resp. as &quot;X. subundulatum&quot; and &quot;X. bracteatum&quot;. In 1989, misaligned species of &quot;Helichrysum&quot; were reclassified in &quot;Syncarpha&quot;. Species included in &quot;Pseudognaphalium&quot;, &quot;Anaphalis&quot;, &quot;Achyrocline&quot; and &quot;Humeocline&quot; are probably congeneric with &quot;Helichrysum&quot;. Australian species have also been reclassified to the genus &quot;Chrysocephalum&quot;, including &quot;Chrysocephalum semipapposum&quot; and &quot;Chrysocephalum apiculatum&quot;.

==Uses==

Several species are grown as ornamental plants, and for dried flowers. When cut young and dried, the open flowers and stalks preserve their colour and shape for long periods.

&quot;Helichrysum italicum&quot; (synonym &quot;Helichrysum angustifolium&quot;) is steam distilled to produce a yellow-reddish essential oil popular in fragrance for its unique scent, best described as herbaceous, sweet, and honey-like. The epithet &quot;angustifolium&quot; means narrow leaved. It is commonly misspelled as &quot;augustifolium&quot;.

<text>Myocastor is a genus of rodent that contains the living nutria (or coypu), as well as several fossil species.

==Taxonomy==
Due to similar cranial morphology, the nutria was once considered a close relative of the Caribbean hutias and placed together with them in the family Capromyidae. Later, it was more accepted to place it in its own family, the Myocastoridae. Recent molecular studies place them in the family Echimyidae, in the tribe Myocastorini.

===Fossil record===
Kerber et al. (2013) recognize the following species as valid:

*&quot;Myocastor columnaris&quot; (Middle Pleistocene)
*&quot;Myocastor obesus&quot; (Late Miocene)
*&quot;Myocastor paranensis&quot; (Late Miocene)

Other species described but no longer considered valid include &quot;Myocastor minor&quot;, &quot;Myocastor perditus&quot;, and &quot;Myocastor priscus&quot;.

<text>The J.M. Smucker Company, also known as Smuckers, is an American manufacturer of food and beverage products. Headquartered in Orrville, Ohio, the company was founded in 1897 as a maker of apple butter. J.M. Smucker currently has three major business units: consumer foods, pet foods, and coffee. Its flagship brand, Smucker&#x27;s, produces fruit preserves, peanut butter, syrups, frozen crustless sandwiches, and ice cream toppings.

Among J.M. Smucker&#x27;s other food and coffee brands are Bick&#x27;s Pickle, Café Bustelo, Carnation Milk (Canada), Crosse &amp; Blackwell, Dunkin&#x27;, Five Roses (Canada), Folgers, Golden Temple (Canada), Jif, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, Laura Scudder&#x27;s, Robin Hood (Canada), Santa Cruz Organic, and Smucker&#x27;s Uncrustables. Pet food brands include Meow Mix and Milk-Bone, among others. In 2023, Smuckers acquired Hostess Brands, the makers of Twinkies, in a $5.6 billion cash and stock deal. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, J.M. Smucker ranks 426th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500, with an estimated 2022 market value of $14.6 billion.

== History ==
===Founding (1897–1958)===
The J.M. Smucker Company was founded in 1897 by Jerome Monroe Smucker. Smucker was born on December 5, 1858, in Orrville, Ohio, and much of his life was spent as a farmer in Orrville. In 1897 Smucker built a cider mill in Orrville. The company, which came to produce jellies, jams, and other food items, has stated that he used apples from local Orrville trees planted by Johnny Appleseed in the early nineteenth century. Smucker prepared apple butter and sold it from the back of a horse-drawn wagon. 
The company was incorporated in 1921. At the time, the company sold preserves and jellies, and by 1928 was distributing in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. After the company recorded losses in 1932 and 1933, in 1935 Smucker&#x27;s eldest son Willard established a Smucker&#x27;s plant in the state of Washington for pre-processing apples, which were then shipped to Orrville to be cooked. After introducing its trademark glass jar in 1939, annual sales reached $1 million. In 1940, Smucker&#x27;s introduced its first line of ice cream toppings, and two years later began distributing its products nationally. During World War II, the company faced shortages of labor, glass, and fruit. In 1946, Smucker&#x27;s earned the designation &quot;U.S. Grade A Fancy&quot; after it paid U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors to &quot;oversee every aspect of its production.&quot;

===National expansion and IPO (1959–1984)===
The company went public in 1959, and the following year J.M. Smucker opened a manufacturing plant in Salinas, California that increased its production capacity by 40%. In 1960, Paul Smucker became president and the company hired Wyse Advertising of Cleveland to produce radio spots. J.M. Smucker was then listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1965.

1963 saw J.M. Smucker&#x27;s acquisition of the jams and jellies company Mary Ellen. Profits increased between 1959 and 1969 before dropping in 1970. Between 1973 and 1980, J.M. Smucker implemented cost cutting measures to increase profit margins, acquiring manufacturing operations in Oregon, Tennessee and California and consolidating packing operations. In 1978, J.M. Smucker debuted a low sugar &quot;spread&quot; that was so low in sugar the Food and Drug Administration wouldn&#x27;t allow Smucker&#x27;s to market it as a jam. J.M. Smucker acquired gourmet preserves company Dickinson&#x27;s in 1979, and by 1980, J.M. Smucker was the number one jams and jellies company in the United States, with over 25% of the market in the United States.

In 1981, Timothy Smucker was named president and the company purchased Magic Shell the following year. After purchasing the pickle companies Wooster Preserving Co. and the H.W. Madison Co. in the 1960s, the company sold its unsuccessful pickle line in the early 1980s. J.M. Smucker in 1984 continued to be traded on the NYSE, with the Smucker family retaining a 30% interest in the business. That year J.M. Smucker acquired the juices company Knudsen &amp; Sons.

===Diversification and growth (1980s–2016)=== 
In the late 1980s, the company began expanding internationally under CEO Richard Smucker, acquiring brands in Canada, the United States, Australia, and Europe. In 1987 J.M. Smucker purchased R-Line Foods, and in 1988 the company acquired the Canadian toppings brand Shirriff which made products such as Good Morning Marmalade. J.M. Smucker&#x27;s sales reached $367 million in 1989. In 1989 J.M. Smucker purchased the Australian company Henry Jones Foods, later selling it in 2004 to SPC Ardmona. By 1993, 8% of J.M. Smucker&#x27;s annual sales were international.

The peanut butter company Laura Scudder&#x27;s and the juice company After the Fall were purchased in 1994, and that year J.M. Smucker also changed advertising agencies from Wyse Advertising to the Leo Burnett Company. The annual Peanut Butter Festival in the town of New Bethlehem, Pennsylvania is co-sponsored by Smucker&#x27;s. First held in 1996, the festival was held in New Bethlehem because the Smucker&#x27;s peanut butter factory was the lead employer in the area at the time. In 1998, J.M. Smucker acquired the peanut butter company Adams, as well as the maker of the &quot;Incredible Uncrustables&quot; frozen crustless sandwich, MenUSAver. J.M. Smucker renamed the product &quot;Uncrustables&quot;. J.M. Smucker acquired Jif and Crisco in 2002.

By 2004, the company was still headquartered in Orrville, Ohio and had been family-run for four generations. Between 1998 and 2004, the company had appeared on &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual listing of the 100 Best Companies to Work For in the United States each year, ranking number one in 2004. That year the company purchased International Multifoods Corporation. Among the acquired brands in the deal were Pillsbury, Hungry Jack, Pet, Bick&#x27;s pickles and condiments, and Canadian flour companies Golden Temple, and Robin Hood. In 2006, White Lily Brand was acquired. In 2007, the Canadian flour company Five Roses was acquired. That same year, the company also acquired King Kelly Orange Marmalade, Eagle Family Foods, which brought in the brands Eagle Brand/Borden milk products, None Such mincemeat, and Kava coffee. 

In 2008, J.M. Smucker joined the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s 500 Index. That May, J.M. Smucker announced it had bought the food division of Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm from ConAgra Foods, while Cedar Fair continued to own the theme park itself. That year it also purchased the frozen produce company Europe&#x27;s Best in Canada and the milk brand Carnation. On November 6, 2008, J.M. Smucker purchased the Folgers coffee brand division from Procter &amp; Gamble for $3.3 billion, acquiring brands such as Millstone Coffee in the process. The Reverse Morris Trust merger doubled J.M. Smucker&#x27;s size.

In 2010, J.M. Smucker acquired Rowland Coffee Roasters, makers of Latin coffee brands, followed by the North American coffee and tea operations of Sara Lee in 2011. J.M. Smucker acquired Big Heart Pet Brands in 2015 for $5.8 billion, bringing in brands such as Milk Bone, Meow Mix, Kibbles ‘n Bits and Pup-Peroni. Also that year, J.M. Smucker announced it would sell its canned milk operations in the United States to Eagle Family Foods Group LLC. In February 2015, J.M Smucker and Keurig partnered together on making K-Cup packs of Dunkin&#x27; coffee. Mark Smucker was named CEO in 2016.

===Recent (2017–present)===

After an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in early March 2018, ConAgra Brands Inc. and J. M. Smucker Co. cancelled a deal for Smucker to purchase the Wesson cooking oil brand. The FTC claimed that Smuckers would have controlled at least 70% of the market for branded canola and vegetable oils. As part of a strategy to focus on pet food, coffee, and snacking, on August 31, 2018, J.M. Smucker announced it had sold its baking business in the United States to Brynwood Partners for $375 million, including the brands Pillsbury, Martha White, Hungry Jack, White Lily, and Jim Dandy. The baking business in Canada was retained. The company acquired Ainsworth Pet Nutrition in 2018, including the brands Better Than! Treats, Dad&#x27;s Pet Care, and Rachael Ray Nutrish, and in October 2018, J.M. Smucker consolidated its $580 million marketing business into Publicis Groupe.
During the COVID-19 pandemic many J.M. Smucker employees began remote work. J.M. Smucker began providing &quot;pay and benefits to employees to avoid furloughs,&quot; creating employee hardship and sick leave programs. By August 2020, its international and away-from-home segment had seen a quarterly sales decline of 9%. The Smucker&#x27;s brand had seen a 25% quarterly increase in sales, Uncrustables had seen a 35% jump, and Crisco had seen a 50% increase. In September 2020, the company announced a new logo and corporate brand identity, with aims to distinguish Smucker the company from Smucker&#x27;s brand food items. J.M. Smucker Company was shortened to J.M. Smucker Co. In December 2020 J.M. Smucker sold Crisco to B&amp;G Foods for $550 million, part of the company&#x27;s ongoing plan to divest of baking products in the United States. Overall in 2020, J.M. Smucker had $7.8 billion in net sales, with free cash flow growing 26% from 2019 to $985.5 million. Its US retail consumer foods unit saw a 22% jump in annual profits, while coffee rose 11% and pet food rose 6%. After selling Natural Balance Pet Foods to Nexus Capital for $50 million in Jan. 2021, in early 2022, the company sold R.W. Knudsen and truRoots to Nexus Capital. The deal included an agreement for Nexus Capital to Santa Cruz Organic beverages, although not the brand&#x27;s food items. The deal was estimated at $110 million. In January 2024, the Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm grocery brand was discontinued due to low sales.

===Hostess Brands acquisition===
On 11 September 2023, J.M. Smucker announced an acquisition of Hostess Brands for $5.6 billion in cash and stock. This will bring several snack brands, including Twinkies, CupCakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Fruit Pies, CoffeeCakes, MiniMuffins, and Voortman cookies, along with seven manufacturing and distribution facilities, and 3,000 employees to J.M. Smucker. The acquisition was completed in November 2023.

==Current brands==
J.M. Smucker&#x27;s four major business units are consumer foods, pet food, snacks, and coffee. The company is particularly known as a marketer and manufacturer of products such as fruit spreads, peanut butter, ice cream toppings, sweetened condensed milk, and health and natural foods and beverages. The Smucker&#x27;s flagship brand manufactures and sells its own brands of fruit preserves, jelly, peanut butter including Smucker&#x27;s Goober PB&amp;J, syrups, ice cream toppings including Smucker&#x27;s Magic Shell, and the &quot;Uncrustables&quot; sealed crustless sandwich.

<doc id="571695" wikidata="Q77109" url="?curid=571695" title="Golo Mann">
<text>Golo Mann (born Angelus Gottfried Thomas Mann; 27 March 1909 – 7 April 1994) was a popular German historian and essayist. After completing a doctorate in philosophy under Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg, in 1933 he fled Hitler&#x27;s Germany. He followed his father, the writer Thomas Mann, and other members of his family in emigrating first to France, then to Switzerland and, on the eve of war, to the United States. From the late 1950s he re-established himself in Switzerland and West Germany as a literary historian.

Mann was perhaps best known for his master work &quot;German History in the 19th and 20th Century&quot; (1958). A survey of German political history, it emphasised the nihilistic and aberrant nature of the Hitler regime. In his later years, Mann took issue with historians who sought to contextualise the crimes of the regime by comparing them with those of Stalinism in Soviet Union and with wartime Allied bombing. At the same time he was sharply critical of those, broadly on the left, who carried a unique German guilt for the Holocaust not only back into the pre-Nazi past but forward in a manner that seemed to question the legitimacy of the postwar Federal Republic.

==Early life and education==
Mann was born in Munich, the grandchild, on the side of his mother, Katia, of the German Jewish mathematician and artist Alfred Pringsheim and the actress Hedwig Pringsheim, and on the side of his father, the writer Thomas Mann, of the Lübeck senator and grain merchant Johann Heinrich Mann and his Brazilian wife, the writer Júlia da Silva Bruhns who was of Portuguese-Indigenous Brazilian descent.

As a child, he pronounced his first name as &quot;Golo&quot;, and this name was adopted. He had an elder sister, Erika Mann, an elder brother, Klaus Mann, and three younger siblings, Monika, Elisabeth and Michael.

In her diary his mother describes him in his early years as sensitive, nervous and frightened. His father hardly concealed his disappointment and rarely mentioned the son in his diary. Golo Mann in turn described him later: &quot;Indeed he was able to radiate some kindness, but mostly it was silence, strictness, nervousness or rage.&quot; Among his siblings he was most tightly connected with Klaus, whereas he disliked the dogmatism and radical views of his sister Erika.

An average pupil, he received a classical education at the Wilhelms-Gymnasium in Munich beginning in September 1918, revealing talents in history, Latin, and especially in reciting poems, the latter being a lifelong passion. &quot;Longing to be like the others&quot;, at school he joined a nationalist youth association (Deutsch-Nationale Jugendbund) but was soon talked out of it by the conversations he heard at the family table: discussion of the need for &quot;tolerance and above all peace, and therefore of above all, so Franco-German reconciliation&quot;. Later in the 1920s he shared his father&#x27;s enthusiasm for Pan-European Union.

New horizons appeared to open in 1923, when Mann entered the Schule Schloss Salem, a famously spartan boarding school where he was joined by his sister Monika, near Lake Constance. He felt liberated from home, enjoyed the new educational approach, and developed an enduring passion for hiking. Yet in 1925 Mann suffered a mental crisis that overshadowed the rest of his life. &quot;In those days the doubt entered my life, or rather broke in with tremendous power ... I was seized by darkest melancholy.&quot;

Upon the final school exams in 1927, he commenced his studies of law in Munich, moving the same year to Berlin and switching to history and philosophy. He used the summer of 1928 to learn French in Paris and to get to know &quot;real work&quot; during six weeks in a coal mine in Lower Lusatia, abruptly stopping because of new knee injuries.

At last Mann entered the University of Heidelberg in spring 1929. Here he followed the advice of his teacher Karl Jaspers to graduate in philosophy on the one hand, and to study history and Latin with the prospect of becoming a schoolteacher on the other. He nevertheless found time to join a Social-Democratic Party student group in the autumn of 1930. The students were sharply critical of the party leadership in Berlin for tolerating the presidentialist Brüning government. In May 1932, Mann finished his dissertation, &quot;Concerning the terms of the individual and the ego in Hegel&#x27;s works&quot;, which was rated with an average &quot;cum laude&quot;. (While recognising Mann&#x27;s literary potential, Jaspers suggested to Mann that the lack of originality and clarity in his analysis is something that would have shamed his father).

Golo Mann&#x27;s plans to further his university studies in Hamburg and Göttingen were interrupted in January 1933 by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s appointment as German Chancellor. His father, who never hesitated to articulate his dislike for National Socialism, and his mother moved to Switzerland. Golo Mann looked after the family house in Munich in April 1933, helped his three younger siblings leave the country and brought the greater part of his parents&#x27; savings via Karlsruhe and the German embassy in Paris to Switzerland.

==Emigration==
On 31 May 1933, Mann left Germany for the French town of Bandol near Toulon. He spent the summer at the mansion of the American travel writer William Seabrook near Sanary-sur-Mer and lived six further weeks at the new family house in Küsnacht near Zürich. In November, he joined the École Normale Supérieure at Saint-Cloud near Paris for two &quot;intensive, instructive years&quot; as lecturer on the German language. At that time, he worked for the emigrants&#x27; journal &quot;Die Sammlung&quot; (&quot;The Collection&quot;) founded by his brother Klaus.

In November 1935, Mann accepted a call from the University of Rennes to lecture on German language and literature. Mann&#x27;s travels to Switzerland suggest that the relationship with his father was easier, perhaps because Thomas Mann had learned to appreciate his son&#x27;s political knowledge. But it was only when Golo Mann helped edit his father&#x27;s diaries in later years that he realised fully how much acceptance he had gained. In a confidential note to the German critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki he wrote, &quot;It was inevitable that I had to wish his death; but I was completely broken-hearted when he passed away&quot;.

In 1936, Thomas Mann and his family were deprived of their German citizenship. His father&#x27;s admirer, the Czech businessman Rudolf Fleischmann, helped Golo Mann obtain Czechoslovak citizenship, but plans to continue studies in Prague were disrupted by the Sudeten crisis.

Early in 1939, Mann traveled to Princeton, New Jersey, where his father worked as guest professor. Although war was drawing closer, he hesitantly returned to Zürich in August to become editor of the emigrant journal &quot;Maß und Wert&quot; (Measure and Value).

As a reaction to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s successes in the West in May 1940 during World War II, and at a time when many of his friends in Zürich were being mobilised for the defence of Swiss neutrality, Mann decided to join a Czech military unit on French soil as a volunteer. Upon crossing the border he was arrested at Annecy and brought to the French concentration camp Les Milles, a brickyard near Aix-en-Provence. In the beginning of August, in what was then unoccupied Vichy France, he was released by the intervention of an American committee. On 13 September 1940, he undertook a daring escape from Perpignan across the Pyrenees to Spain. With him were his uncle Heinrich Mann, the latter&#x27;s wife Nelly Kröger, Alma Mahler-Werfel and Franz Werfel. On 4 October 1940, they boarded the &quot;Nea Hellas&quot; headed for New York City.

Mann stayed at his parents&#x27; house in Princeton, then in New York City where he lived for a time in what his father described as a &quot;kind of Bohemian colony&quot; with W. H. Auden (with whom his sister Erika contracted a marriage of convenience), Benjamin Britten, the tenor Peter Pears and others.

In the autumn of 1942, Mann finally got the chance to teach history at Olivet College in Michigan, but soon followed his brother Klaus into the US Army. After basic training at Fort McClellan, Alabama, he worked at the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, D.C. In his capacity as intelligence officer it was his duty to collect and translate relevant information.

In April 1944, he was sent to London where he made radio commentaries for the German language division of the American Broadcasting Station. For the last months of World War II, he worked in same function for a military propaganda station in Luxembourg. Then he helped organise the foundation of Radio Frankfurt. During this period, he worked with, and won the confidence of, Robert Lochner. Returning to Germany in the immediate aftermath of the Allied advance, he was shocked at the extent of destruction, especially that caused by British and American bombing.

In 1946, Mann left the US Army by his own request. He nevertheless kept a job as civil control officer, watching the war crimes trials at Nuremberg in this capacity. The same year saw the publication of his first book of lasting value, a biography in English of the 19th century diplomat Friedrich von Gentz who was to account a critical influence upon his own political thinking.

In the autumn of 1947, Mann became an assistant professor of history at Claremont Men&#x27;s College in California. In hindsight he recalled the nine-year engagement as &quot;the happiest of my life&quot;; on the other hand, he complained, &quot;My students are scornful, unfriendly and painfully stupid as never before&quot;. The professorship in California was interrupted by several residences in German-speaking Europe.

==Return to Europe==
In 1956 and 1957, Mann spent many weeks at the tavern &quot;Zur Krone&quot; at Altnau on the shores of Lake Constance, writing his &quot;German History of the 19th and 20th century&quot;. It was published in 1958 and became an instant bestseller. It also marked his final return to Europe because he became guest professor at the University of Münster for two winter terms in a row.

In autumn 1960, Mann joined the University of Stuttgart (then the &quot;Technische Hochschule Stuttgart&quot;) in the higher position of professor in ordinary for Political Science. It soon became clear that he felt unsatisfied with the machinery at the universities: &quot;In those years I had a feeling of immense, but fruitless effort without getting any echo. This led to a depression that made me resign the professorship in 1963&quot;.

In the following years, Mann worked as a free-lance historian and essayist, suffering in both capacities from chronic overwork that increasingly damaged not only his work but also his health. He took up residence at his parents&#x27; house in Kilchberg near the Lake of Zurich, where he lived until 1993 — sharing the house for most years with his mother.

Of his sixteen historical studies, the bestselling proved to be a monumental biography of Albrecht von Wallenstein published in 1971. It arose from a fascination in childhood with the role in the Thirty Years&#x27; War of the imperial marshal for which, Mann confessed, he had no satisfactory explanation. The &quot;LA Times&quot; described &quot;Wallenstein: His Life Narrated&quot; as “a work not only of erudition but of art.”

==Political engagement==

Asked in 1965 by the television interviewer Günter Gaus how in the last days of the Weimar Republic he had avoided being pulled like so many of his generation to the political extremes of either the right or left, Mann suggested it had been a matter not only of analysis but also of temperament. Figures like Calvin or Robespierre, Trotsky or Lenin, he had &quot;always hated&quot;. Mann described his own outlook as broadly conservative. But conservatism too he rejected when presented as an &quot;ism&quot;—when represented by those who believed they had a monopoly of truth (as if they had &quot;eaten the truth with a spoon&quot;).

By conservative, Mann understood a particular stance (&quot;Haltung&quot;), or tendency of thought. It is an assessment of human nature sufficiently pessimistic to reject utopian belief in the reliable goodness or reason of man and, accordingly, can appreciate the value of inherited ties, even if irrational, so long as &quot;they bind people and give them a moral and spiritual home.&quot; It is not an attitude Mann identified in party-political terms: he might &quot;very well be able to vote Social Democratic&quot; without seeing any contradiction in himself having these basic conservative tendencies.

In early years of the Federal Republic, Mann praised Konrad Adenauer for his policy of seeking reconciliation and integration with France and alliance with the United States. In time, however, he came to criticise the Chancellor&#x27;s commitment to German unification as largely rhetorical. Later still, believing that the post-war territorial settlement had to be accepted as &quot;an accomplished fact&quot;, he supported the &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; of Willy Brandt as foreign minister (1966–1969) and then as the new Social-Democratic Chancellor (1969–1974). He would sometimes even ghostwrite for Brandt. But he was to emphasise that as an acknowledgement of &quot;hard facts that can no longer be changed&quot;, his support of diplomatic recognition of Europe&#x27;s post-war division was &quot;more conservative than revolutionary&quot;.

Mann had been wary of the left-wing student movement and the development of the so-called &quot;extra-parliamentary opposition&quot; (&quot;ausser parlamentarische opposition&quot;) in the 1960s and was to reproach Brandt as Chancellor for taking an insufficiently hard line against East German infiltration and domestic subversion. Mann called the terrorist activities of the Red Army Faction &quot;a new development in the phenomenon of civil war&quot;.

It was nonetheless a shock to many when in 1979, with a post-script to the politician&#x27;s hagiographic campaign book, Mann announced his support for Franz-Josef Strauß, the right-wing Chancellor candidate of the CDU/CSU. He sought to justify his choice as precautionary. Tax-supported welfare had advanced to the point at which it &quot;greatly diminished the joy of making money&quot; with potentially dire consequences for a future in which &quot;more and more retirees&quot; will depend, proportionately, on an &quot;ever smaller number of productive workers&quot;. There was also need for a retrenchment in Ostpolitik. In Afghanistan the West had failed to contain the Soviet Union. Were he an American, Mann allowed that he would have voted for Reagan rather than Carter.

Mann foresaw the reputational loss of embracing Strauss, a figure who, since the Spiegel Affair in 1962 had been a &quot;bete noir&quot; of liberal and left opinion. &quot;I will have to pay for it&quot;, he wrote in his diary, as Kaiser Wilhelm did for his &#x27;Daily Telegraph Affair&#x27;&quot;.

In one of his last interviews, with &quot;Die Welt&quot; in 1991, Mann again alarmed his more liberal readers and colleagues by calling for restrictions on the constitutional provision for political asylum. To the suggestion that Germany should openly acknowledge itself as an immigrant country (&quot;Einwanderungsland&quot;), the man who had himself sought asylum abroad said &quot;No, the boat is full&quot;.

==Hitler in German historiography==
In the early years of the Federal Republic, Mann acknowledged that Hitler had been an &quot;unpleasant subject&quot; too often avoided. But as a staunch defender of the political and economic achievements of post-war West Germany, once the taboo was broken he had little patience with the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; thesis which placed Hitlerism within a context of German exceptionalism, or with the &quot;critical-emancipatory&quot; historiography of the 1968 generation and the Bielefeld school of early 1970s. He was critical of what he regarded as the Left&#x27;s obsession with &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; (working through the past). In 1978 he posed the rhetorical question: &quot;When will the past cease to poison the present&quot;.

It was perhaps from this perspective that, years before, Mann had been among the first critics of Hannah Arendt&#x27;s &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; (1963). Arendt had portrayed Adolf Eichmann, the principal organiser of the Nazi genocide of European Jewry, less as an exceptional anti-Semite than as a typical, if unusually talented, German bureaucrat. The controversy led to Mann&#x27;s permanent estrangement from Jaspers, who had also been Arendt&#x27;s doctoral supervisor.

Mann insisted that there was nothing preordained about Hitlerism. It was not the inevitable product, as others had suggested, of the contradictions of the Reich&#x27;s formation or of the chaos induced by its defeat in the Great War. The Weimar Republic did not have to collapse; the Jews of Europe did not have to die, or even have to be classified as Jews. In an essay collected in &quot;Geschichte und Geschichten&quot; (1962), he excoriated A. J. P. Taylor for his certitude on the subject:At the same time, Mann rejected the temptation to &quot;normalise&quot; the Holocaust by setting the genocide in an international context. Although not among the principal protagonists in the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot; (historians&#x27; dispute, 1986–88), Mann&#x27;s comments broadly aligned him with Eberhard Jäckel (who had replaced Mann on the faculty in Stuttgart). Like Jäckel, Mann opposed the revisionist efforts of Ernst Nolte to press comparisons with, and to find context in, Stalinism or in Allied carpet bombing, or to otherwise deny the uniqueness of what Mann described as the &quot;vilest crime ever perpetrated by man against man.&quot;

==Last years==
In 1986, his adopted son Hans Beck-Mann died. Beck-Mann was a pharmacist he got to know in 1955 and supported financially in his studies. In November of the same year his successful semi-autobiography &quot;Erinnerungen und Gedanken. Eine Jugend in Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Memories and Thoughts. A Youth in Germany&quot;) was published. He immediately started work at a sequel that was never finished. In 1988, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Letters) by the University of Bath.

After the death of his adopted son, he lived a secluded life, most of the time in Berzona, in the Swiss Canton of the Ticino. He devoted his time to translating into German the work of the dark and picaresque Spanish novelist Pío Baroja. He was surrounded by a group of young Spanish-language enthusiasts, some of whom have become notable in their field.

The East German regime lifted its ban on Golo Mann at the beginning of 1989. Not only was his &quot;Wallenstein&quot; biography finally available in East Germany after 18 years — he was even allowed to read from it on invitation from the East German Minister of Education. When the reunification of Germany came only one year later, he reacted dispassionately: &quot;No delight in German unity. They are bound to fool around once more, even if I won&#x27;t live to see it&quot;.

In March 1990, Mann had a heart attack after a public lecture. In the same year it became evident that he suffered from prostate cancer. Because of his ill health he moved to Leverkusen in 1992, where he was nursed by Ingrid Beck-Mann, the widow of his adopted son Hans. A few days prior to his death, he acknowledged his homosexuality in a TV interview: &quot;I did not fall in love often. I often kept it to myself, maybe that was a mistake. It also was forbidden, even in America, and one had to be a little careful&quot;. According to Tilman Lahme&#x27;s biography, although Golo Mann did not act out his homosexuality as openly as his brother Klaus Mann he had had love relationships since his student days.

On 7 April 1994, Mann died in Leverkusen aged 85. His urn was buried in Kilchberg, but—in fulfillment of his last will—outside the family grave.

Golo Mann&#x27;s literary estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern. In 2009 the German Postal system honoured the 100th anniversary of Golo Mann&#x27;s birth with a new stamp, which displayed his portrait with the caption &quot;Literarischer Historiker&quot; (literary historian).

<text>Erika Julia Hedwig Mann (9 November 1905 – 27 August 1969) was a German actress and writer, daughter of the novelist Thomas Mann.

Erika lived a bohemian lifestyle in Berlin and became a critic of National Socialism. After Hitler came to power in 1933, she moved to Switzerland, and married the poet W. H. Auden, purely to obtain a British passport and so avoid becoming stateless when the Germans cancelled her citizenship. She continued to attack Nazism, most notably with her 1938 book &quot;School for Barbarians&quot;, a critique of the Nazi education system.

During World War II, Mann worked for the BBC and became a war correspondent attached to the Allied forces after D-Day. She attended the Nuremberg trials before moving to America to support her exiled parents. Her criticisms of American foreign policy led to her being considered for deportation. After her parents moved to Switzerland in 1952, she also settled there. She wrote a biography of her father and died in Zürich in 1969.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Erika Mann was born in Munich, the first-born daughter of German writer and later Nobel Prize winner Thomas Mann and his wife, Katia (née Pringsheim), the daughter of an intellectual German family of Jewish heritage. Due to her being the granddaughter of Júlia da Silva Bruhns, she was also of Portuguese-Indigenous Brazilian partial descent. She was named after Katia Mann&#x27;s brother Erik, who died early, Thomas Mann&#x27;s sister and her great-grandmother Hedwig Dohm. She was baptized Protestant, just as her mother had been. Thomas Mann expressed in a letter to his brother Heinrich Mann his disappointment about the birth of his first child:

Nevertheless, he later candidly confessed in the notes of his diary, that he &quot;preferred, of the six, the two oldest [Erika and Klaus] and little Elisabeth with a strange decisiveness&quot;.

In Erika he had a particular trust, which later showed itself in that she exercised a great influence on the important decisions of her father. Her particular role was also known by her siblings, as her brother Golo Mann remembered: &quot;Little Erika must salt the soup&quot;. This reference to the twelve-year-old Erika from the year 1917 was an often-used phrase in the Mann family.

After Erika&#x27;s birth came that of her brother Klaus, with whom she was personally close her entire life. They went about &quot;like twins&quot; and Klaus described their closeness as follows: &quot;our solidarity was absolute and without reservation&quot;. Eventually there were four more children in total, including Golo, Monika, Elisabeth and Michael. The children grew up in Munich. On their mother&#x27;s side the family belonged to the influential urban upper class and their father came from a commercial family from Lübeck and already had published the successful novel &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; in 1901. The Mann home was a gathering-place for intellectuals and artists and Erika was hired for her first theater engagement before finishing her &quot;Abitur&quot; at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin.

===Education and early theatrical work===
In 1914, the Mann family obtained a villa on 1 Poschingerstraße in Bogenhausen, which in the family would come to be known as &quot;Poschi.&quot; From 1912 to 1914, Erika Mann attended a private school with her brother, joining for a year the Bogenhausener Volksschule, and from 1915 to 1920 she attended the Höhere Mädchenschule am St. Annaplatz. In May 1921, she transferred to the Munich-based Luisengymnasium. Together with her brother Klaus, she befriended children in the neighborhood, including Bruno Walter&#x27;s daughters, Gretel and Lotte Walter, as well as Ricki Hallgarten, the son of a Jewish intellectual family.

Erika Mann founded an ambitious theater troupe, the Laienbund Deutscher Mimiker. While still a student at the Munich Luisengymnasium, Max Reinhardt engaged her to appear on the stage of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin for the first time. The partially mischievous pranks that she undertook in the so-called &quot;Herzogpark-Bande&quot; (&quot;Herzogpark gang&quot;) with Klaus and her friends prompted her parents to send both her and Klaus to a progressive residential school, the Bergschule Hochwaldhausen, located in Vogelsberg in Oberhessen. This period in Erika Mann&#x27;s schooling lasted from April to July 1922; subsequently she returned to the Luisengymnasium. In 1924 she passed the Abitur, albeit with poor marks, and began her theatrical studies in Berlin that were again interrupted, because of her numerous engagements in Hamburg, Munich, Berlin and elsewhere.

===1920s and 1930s===
In 1924, Erika Mann began theater studies in Berlin and acted there and in Bremen. In 1925, she played in the première of her brother Klaus&#x27;s play &quot;Anja und Esther&quot;. The play, about a group of four friends who were in love with each other, opened in October 1925 to considerable publicity. In 1924 the actor Gustaf Gründgens had offered to direct the production and play one of the lead male roles, alongside Klaus, with Erika and Pamela Wedekind as the female leads. During the year they worked on the play together, Klaus was engaged to Wedekind and Erika became engaged to Gründgens. Erika and Pamela were also in a relationship together, as were, for a time, Klaus and Gustaf. For their honeymoon, in July 1926, Erika and Gründgens stayed in a hotel that Erika and Wedekind had used as a couple shortly before, with the latter checking in dressed as a man. Erika&#x27;s marriage to Gründgens was short-lived and they were soon living apart before divorcing in 1929.

In 1936, her brother Klaus wrote the book Mephisto, whose main character was loosely based on Gründgens, posed as a man who sold his soul to the devil, (the Nazis). The book, which drew a lawsuit from Gründgens&#x27; nephew in the 1960s, was made into a film of the same name in 1981, starring Klaus Maria Brandauer.

Erika Mann would later have relationships with Therese Giehse, Annemarie Schwarzenbach and Betty Knox, with whom she served as a war correspondent during World War II.

In 1927, Erika and Klaus undertook a trip around the world, which they documented in their book &quot;Rundherum; Das Abenteuer einer Weltreise&quot;. The following year, she became active in journalism and politics. She was involved as an actor in the 1931 film about lesbianism, &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot;, directed by Leontine Sagan, but left the production before its completion. In 1932 she published &quot;Stoffel fliegt übers Meer&quot;, the first of seven children&#x27;s books.

In 1932, Erika Mann was denounced by the Brownshirts after she read a pacifist poem to an anti-war meeting. She was fired from an acting role after the theatre concerned was threatened with a boycott by the Nazis. Mann successfully sued both the theatre and also a Nazi-run newspaper. Also in 1932 Mann had a role, alongside Therese Giehse, in the film &quot;Peter Voss, Thief of Millions&quot;.

In January 1933, Erika, Klaus and Therese Giehse founded a cabaret in Munich called &quot;Die Pfeffermühle&quot;, for which Erika wrote most of the material, much of which was anti-Fascist. The cabaret lasted two months before the Nazis forced it to close and Mann left Germany. She was the last member of the Mann family to leave Germany after the Nazi regime was elected. She saved many of Thomas Mann&#x27;s papers from their Munich home when she escaped to Zürich. In 1936, &quot;Die Pfeffermühle&quot; opened again in Zürich and became a rallying point for German exiles.

In 1935, it became apparent that the Nazis were intending to strip Mann of her German citizenship; her uncle, Heinrich Mann, was the first person to be stripped of German citizenship when the Nazis took office. She asked Christopher Isherwood if he would marry her so she could become a British citizen. He declined but suggested she approach the gay poet W. H. Auden, who readily agreed to a marriage of convenience in 1935. Mann and Auden never lived together but remained on good terms throughout their lives and were still married when Mann died; she left him a small bequest in her will. In 1936, Auden introduced Therese Giehse, Mann&#x27;s lover, to the writer John Hampson and they too married so that Giehse could leave Germany. In 1937, Mann moved to New York, where &quot;Die Pfeffermühle&quot; (as &quot;The Peppermill&quot;) opened its doors again. There Erika Mann lived with Therese Giehse, her brother Klaus and Annemarie Schwarzenbach, amid a large group of artists in exile that included Kurt Weill, Ernst Toller and Sonia Sekula.

In 1938, Mann and Klaus reported on the Spanish Civil War, and her book &quot;School for Barbarians&quot;, a critique of Nazi Germany&#x27;s educational system, was published. The following year, they published &quot;Escape to Life&quot;, a book about famous German exiles.

===World War II===

During World War II, Mann worked as a journalist in London, making radio broadcasts, in German, for the BBC throughout the Blitz and the Battle of Britain. After D-Day, she became a war correspondent attached to the Allied forces advancing across Europe. She reported from recent battlefields in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. She entered Germany in June 1945 and was among the first Allied personnel to enter Aachen.

As soon as it was possible, she went to Munich to register a claim for the return of the Mann family home. When she arrived in Berlin on 3 July 1945, Mann was shocked at the level of destruction, describing the city as &quot;a sea of devastation, shoreless and infinite&quot;. She was equally angry at the complete lack of guilt displayed by some of the German civilians and officials that she met. During this period, as well as wearing an American uniform, Mann adopted an Anglo-American accent.

Mann attended the Nuremberg trial each day from the opening session, on 20 November 1945, until the court adjourned a month later for Christmas. She was present on 26 November when the first film evidence from an extermination camp was shown in the court room. She interviewed the defense lawyers and ridiculed their arguments in her reports and made clear that she thought the court was indulging the behaviour of the defendants, in particular Hermann Göring.

When the court adjourned for Christmas, Mann went to Zürich to spend time with her brother, Betty Knox and Therese Giehse. Mann&#x27;s health was poor and on 1 January 1946, she collapsed and was hospitalised. Eventually, she was diagnosed with pleurisy. After a spell recovering at a spa in Arosa, Mann returned to Nuremberg in March 1946 to continue covering the war crimes trial. In May 1946, Mann left Germany for California to help look after her father who was being treated for lung cancer.

===Later life===

From America, Mann continued to comment on and write about, the situation in Germany. She considered it a scandal that Göring had managed to commit suicide and was furious at the slow pace of the denazification process. In particular, Mann objected to what she considered the lenient treatment of cultural figures, such as the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, who had stayed in Germany throughout the Nazi period.

Her views on Russia and on the Berlin Airlift led to her being branded a Communist in America. Both Klaus and Erika came under an FBI investigation into their political views and rumored homosexuality. In 1949, becoming increasingly depressed and disillusioned over postwar Germany&#x27;s occupation, Klaus Mann died by suicide. This event devastated and enraged Erika Mann. In 1952, due to the anti-communist red scare and the numerous accusations from the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the Mann family left the US and she moved back to Switzerland with her parents. She had begun to help her father with his writing and had become one of his closest confidantes. After the deaths of her father and her brother Klaus, Erika Mann became responsible for their works.

Mann died in Zürich on 27 August 1969 from a brain tumour and is buried at Friedhof Kilchberg in Zürich, also the site of her parents&#x27; graves. She was 63.

<text>In many parliaments and other similar assemblies, seating is typically arranged in banks or rows, with each political party or caucus grouped together. The spokespeople for each group will often sit at the front of their group, and are then known as being on the frontbench (or front bench) and are described as frontbenchers. Those sitting behind them are known as backbenchers. Independent and minority parties sit to the side or on benches between the two sides, and are referred to as crossbenchers. Frontbenchers may be part of a Frontbench Team with other members of their political party.

==United Kingdom==

In the House of Commons, the Government frontbench is traditionally called the Treasury bench (HM Treasury is the oldest government department). The government frontbench is on the right hand side as seen by the Chairman (typically the Speaker of the House of Commons or the Lord Speaker), and is occupied by Government ministers. The opposition frontbench is occupied by &quot;shadow&quot; ministers, of whom the most senior form the Shadow Cabinet.

==Canada==
While backbenchers are referred to in the House of Commons of Canada (and the provincial legislatures), the front seats on the government side are reserved for cabinet ministers. Front row members of the governing party are not referred to as frontbenchers, but as cabinet ministers. Some &quot;frontbenchers&quot; actually sit in the centre of the second row, so as to be seen directly behind the party leader during Question Period (and thus, in the television frame).

The same arrangement exists for each provincial legislature and the territorial legislature of Yukon. In the case of Nunavut and Northwest Territories where there is consensus government with a non-partisan makeup, ministers sit amongst regular members.

==Ireland==
A front bench in Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas of Ireland, refers to any organised group of party members who holds any degree of speaking power (derived from the party) on specific issues. The Teachtaí Dála (TDs) who are members of the Government of Ireland constitute the government front bench, while the members of parties in declared opposition to the government constitute the opposition front bench.

== Australia ==
The Parliament of Australia also has a front bench, which includes all ministers and shadow ministers.

In more recent times, journalists have casually referred to ministers as frontbenchers rather than expressing the due deference of their ministerial positions.

== New Zealand ==
New Zealand follows the Westminster tradition whereby the front benches, or in the New Zealand House of Representatives front &quot;seats&quot;, are reserved for the government and opposition leaders. The government ministers sit to the Speaker&#x27;s right, whilst the opposition leaders sit to the Speaker&#x27;s left (as seen from the Speaker&#x27;s chair). The term frontbencher is therefore also used in New Zealand but usually refers to the foremost leaders and spokespersons of the Official Opposition rather than those on the government front benches.

<doc id="571705" wikidata="Q699145" url="?curid=571705" title="Charles Correa">
<text>Charles Mark Correa (1 September 1930 – 16 June 2015) was an Indian architect and urban planner. Credited with the creation of modern architecture in post-Independent India, he was celebrated for his sensitivity to the needs of the urban poor and for his use of traditional methods and materials.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Charles Correa, a Roman Catholic of Goan descent, was born on 1 September 1930 in Secunderabad. He began his higher studies at St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai. He went on to study at the University of Michigan (1949–53) where Buckminster Fuller was a teacher, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1953–55) where he obtained his master&#x27;s degree.
===Career===
In 1958, Charles Correa established his own professional practice in Mumbai. His first significant project was the Mahatma Gandhi Sangrahalaya (Mahatma Gandhi Memorial) at Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad (1958–1963), followed by the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly in Bhopal (1967). In 1961-1966, he designed his first high-rise building, the Sonmarg apartments in Mumbai. On the National Crafts Museum in New Delhi (1975–1990), he introduced &quot;the rooms open to the sky&quot;, his systematic use of courtyards. In the Jawahar Kala Kendra (Jawahar Arts Centre) in Jaipur (1986–1992), he makes a structural hommage to Jai Singh II. Later, he invited the British artist Howard Hodgkin for the outside design of the British Council in Delhi (1987–1992).

From 1970–75, Charles Correa was Chief Architect for New Bombay (Navi Mumbai), where he was strongly involved in extensive urban planning of the new city. In 1984, Charles Correa founded the Urban Design Research Institute in Bombay, dedicated to the protection of the built environment and improvement of urban communities. During the final four decades of his life, Correa has done pioneering work in urban issues and low-cost shelter in the Third World. In 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi appointed him Chairman of the National Commission on Urbanization.

From 2005 until his 2008 resignation Correa was the Chairman of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission.

Later, Charles Correa designed the new Ismaili Centre in Toronto, Canada, which shared the site with the Aga Khan Museum designed by Fumihiko Maki, and the Champalimaud Foundation Centre in Lisbon, inaugurated by the Portuguese President Aníbal Cavaco Silva on 5 October 2010.
===Final years===
He died on 16 June 2015 in Mumbai following a brief illness.

==Work==
===Style===
Charles Correa designed almost 100 buildings in India, from low-income housing to luxury condos. He rejected the glass-and-steel approach of some post-modernist buildings, and focused on designs deeply rooted in local cultures, all the while providing modern structural solutions under his creative designs. His style was also focused on reintroducing outdoor spaces and terraces.

In 2013, the Royal Institute of British Architects held a retrospective exhibition, &quot;Charles Correa – India&#x27;s Greatest Architect&quot;, about the influences of his work on modern urban Indian architecture.

<text>Enrique Grau (December 18, 1920 – April 1, 2004) was a Colombian artist best known for his depictions of Amerindian and Afro-Colombian figures. He was a member of the triumvirate of key Colombian artists of the 20th century which included Fernando Botero and Alejandro Obregón.

== Early life ==
Grau was born in Panama City, Panama, just like many of the children of his time with Colombian parents, and raised in Cartagena, Colombia. He was the son of Enrique Grau Velez and Carmen Araujo Jimenez.

== Career ==
A self-made artist, he was influenced by the Colombian masters Ignacio Gomez Jaramillo, Santiago Martinez Delgado and Pedro Nel Gómez. Grau studied at the Art Students League in New York City, U.S. from 1941–42, and later toured Italy, where he learned etching and fresco techniques before moving to the city of Cartagena.

He won the Salón de Artistas Colombianos in 1957 launching a well-noted career in the arts. His associations of white, black, and indigenous figures and objects such as masks, eggs, fruit, or cages brought him international fame, with exhibitions at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City and the Paris Museum of Modern Art.

==Death and legacy==
Grau donated 1,300 works of art (including some by other artists) to the city of Cartagena, which were used to establish the Museum of Modern Art.

Grau died of pulmonary complications at a hospital in Bogotá, Colombia, at age 83.

<text>The British Rail Class 02 are a class of twenty 0-4-0 diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives built by the Yorkshire Engine Company in 1960 (first ten, D2850-D2859) and 1961 (D2860–D2869) for service in areas of restricted loading gauge and curvature such as docks. They had the door to the cab at the rear, with a railed veranda behind the cab; this feature was very unusual on British Rail locomotives, although it was used on many Yorkshire Engine Co. designs and is quite normal in North American practice.

==Operation==
Initial deliveries were to Bank Hall shed in Liverpool and most were allocated to depots around Liverpool or Manchester.

===Withdrawal===
With the changes in the role of the British railway system and the closing of many of the facilities in which the Class 02 locomotives worked, they were increasingly surplus to requirements. The first locomotives were withdrawn in December 1969 from the Preston division of the Midland Region and by the end of 1971 there were only four left in service with British Rail. Of these, three survived long enough to enter the BR Total Operations Processing System computer system: 02001 (formerly D2851), 02003 (D2853), and 02004 (D2856), and all three were withdrawn in June 1975 from Allerton TMD. Being between nine and fourteen years old when withdrawn, they were still capable of work, and eleven were sold to private industry, with the remaining nine being scrapped.

== Fleet list ==
== Service with British Railways ==
Many of the locomotives were based in the Liverpool area, serving places like Bank Hall Shed, Allerton TMD, Liverpool Exchange and Garston Dock. Others went to Lostock Shed in Preston or Patricroft Yard near Manchester.

=== D2850 ===
D2850 entered service in 1960 was allocated to Bank Hall Shed, D2850 was transferred to Allerton TMD, where it spent the rest of its service. It was withdrawn and scrapped shortly in 1970 after just 10 years of service.

=== D2851 or 02001 ===
D2851 was one of three locomotives that survived long enough to enter TOPS, spending nearly its entire life at Allerton Depot before it was withdrawn in 1975 and scrapped shortly afterwards. Even as late as 1973, the locomotive still carried its old number. Due to its short lifespan, there are few reported sightings of this locomotive.

=== D2852 ===
D2852 survived in BR service longer than most other locomotives in this class and was allocated the TOPS number 02002, but never carried it. After leaving Bank Hall Shed, the locomotive was transferred to Speke Junction in 1966, and worked at Liverpool&#x27;s Alexandra Dock during its time there. However, the locomotive was moved to Allerton Depot two years later. While in its early years, still in Bank Hall Shed, the units worked mostly the Great Howard Street Goods Yard. Despite its allocations, the unit was occasionally moved to Liverpool Brunswick Dock. While in Allerton Depot, it frequently worked alongside the aforementioned D2851 prior to receiving its TOPS number. D2852 was withdrawn in October 1973, and was scrapped on site by Avon Transmissions on the first of March 1976.

=== D2853 or 02003 ===
D2853 was given the works number 2812 when first built. It entered service in October 1960, and after leaving Bank Hall Shed it worked the Liverpool Docks until it was then transferred to Speke Junction. Despite being transferred to the Docks, it was still officially allocated to Bank Hall Shed. The locomotive was present on the Derby Works Open Day on 31 August 1968. Also in 1968, the unit was transferred from Speke Junction to Allerton TMD with D2852, where it would spend the rest of its BR life working. It was also seen moving goods around the area of Allerton, at Liverpool Exchange in 1973, and in Garston docks in 1975. In 1974, the unit began carrying its new TOPS number, 02003. However, that number didn&#x27;t last long, as the unit was withdrawn in June 1975. Its last years were spent working with D2851, D2852 and D2856. Following withdrawal, it was sold to LCP Fuels of Pensnett near Birmingham.

=== D2854 ===
After Leaving Bank Hall Shed, D2854 stayed in the Liverpool area, but was withdrawn shortly after in 1970 and sold to C F Booth of Rotherham.

=== D2855 ===
D2855 entered service in Bank Hall Shed in November 1960 and was a very short lived locomotive. It was moved to Arpley Yard in Warrington towards the end of its life in the late 1960s before being scrapped on 1 June 1970.

=== D2856 or 02004 ===
D2856 was one of three units to survive long enough to carry a TOPS number. It left Bank Hall Shed in October 1966 and was transferred to Speke Junction and then to Allerton Depot in May 1968. It worked there alongside the other units that survived long enough to enter TOPS until the last three units were withdrawn in June 1975. In 1974, however, the unit was briefly used in Liverpool Exchange. D2856 was stripped for spares in September 1975, with the engine compartment being destroyed in the process, and the rest of the locomotive was scrapped the following month. Before withdrawal and carrying its new number, 02004 worked briefly at Bank Hall Shed once again.

=== D2857 ===
D2857 was given the works number 2816, and like many others of the class worked in only Merseyside under British Rail starting in Bank Hall Shed in December 1960. It then found itself in the Great Howard Street Goods Yard, then Liverpool Exchange, Speke Junction and finally Allerton Depot, where it resided until April 1971. It was then sold to Lowton Metals Ltd. in Haydock.

=== D2858 ===
D2858 originally worked in Newton Heath until 1970, when it was permanently withdrawn and then was sold over to ICI Fertilisers in Widnes, who painted the engine red.

=== D2859 ===
D2859 was given the works number 2825. It was allocated to Burton shed in December 1960 and stayed there until December 1964. It was replaced by Class 03 D2384, which was itself transferred in October 1967. It also worked around the Workington area before being left to rust at the seaside for a number of years prior to scrapping.

=== D2860 ===

D2860 was withdrawn in 1970, and four years later was picked for use in the National Railway Museum as a shunting locomotive, where it still resides today and is labelled as preserved.

=== D2861 ===
D2861 left bank hall shed and was moved briefly to Horwich works in 1963, but was soon after brought to Preston where it worked until December 1969, when it was one of the first five locomotives of the class to be withdrawn. It was scrapped shortly afterwards. Within Preston, it was stored in Lostock Shed. Its number was commonly placed on Class 02 Model trains.

=== D2862 ===
D2862, after leaving Bank hall shed, was moved to Preston at Lostock shed in 1964 and was one of the first five members of the class to be withdrawn in December 1969. It was sold to NCB afterwards to work on various collieries.

=== D2863 ===
D2863 operated in the same areas as D2862 until withdrawal 1969 after which it was scrapped.

=== D2864 ===
D2864 left Bank Hall shed and was sent slightly east to Patricroft Yard, but then was moved to Newton heath where it was stored alongside D2869. It was eventually scrapped in 1970.

=== D2865 ===
D2865 left Bank Hall shed and worked in Warrington before being withdrawn, having been in service only nine years at the time. It was sold into industrial use at Blue Circle Industries Ltd., Kilverington Gypsum Works.

=== D2866 ===
D2866 lived a short, unknown BR life and was withdrawn in 1970, and was sold to Arnott Young &amp; Co. in Dalmuir yard.

=== D2867 ===
D2867 was given the works number 2850. It left Bank Hall shed in 1963 and went to Newton Heath. The following year it was transferred to Fleetwood, and then Lostock Hall the year after that. In 1966, it was moved to Speke Junction and then in 1968 moved again to Allerton Depot, where it was withdrawn in 1970 and was sold to Redland Roadstone Ltd. in Barrow upon Soar. During its BR life it was once transported to Mountsorrel.

=== D2868 ===
D2868 was allocated to Bank Hall shed for the first three years of its life, but spent much of its time working in other areas, such as the Great Howard Street Goods Yard, Liverpool Exchange, Redfern Street Sidings and Garston Dock, all of which are in the Merseyside area where most members of the class worked. In August 1964, it was transferred to Fleetwood where it would work alongside D2867. It was quickly transferred to Lostock Hall one month later. It was one the first five members of the class to be withdrawn, and due to still being in good condition was sold to L.C.P. Fuel Co., Pensnett Trading Estate, Shut End, as 02003 was. While in Lostock Hall, the unit often worked in Greenbank Sidings.

=== D2869 ===
D2869 was given the works number 2852 and was the last locomotive in the class to be built and only worked eight years, leaving Bank Hall shed for Lostock Hall before withdrawal, being moved to Newton Heath for storage before ultimately being scrapped by T W Ward at Beighton, Sheffield in August 1971.

== Industrial use ==
Eight withdrawn locomotives were sold into industrial use in a large variety of locations.

=== 02003 or Peter ===
02003 was sold to LCP Fuels of Pensnett/Brierley Hill in the West Midlands, being renamed Peter. It began operations in 1976, and spent most of its time in small enclosures with tight turns hauling small industrial goods, but in 1980, 02003 was seen working with Class 25 unit 25 273 in the main Pensnett yard working with coke hoppers and larger wagons. It spent its life there until 1997, when it was acquired by the South Yorkshire Preservation Society.

=== D2854 ===
D2854 was purchased in 1971 by the C F Booth Scrapyard of Rotherham for use there. By 1985, much of the exterior of the unit had been cut up and one could see through one end of the locomotive to the other, likely for maintenance. In 1989, the locomotive was sold to the South Yorkshire Railway (now the Heritage Shunters Trust) for preservation, where it still resides.

=== D2857 ===
D2857 operated as a scrapyard shunter in Bird Group&#x27;s scrapyard in Long Marston, where it worked for over a decade before being stored, after which its condition deteriorated. It was stored alongside an ex-GWR iron tool van until 1992, when it was finally scrapped.

=== D2858 ===
D2858 worked in ICI Fertilisers in Widnes until the 1980s, when the factory was closed. It was then sold to Lowton Metals near Haydock, who overhauled the locomotive, and it worked there until 1988 when it was moved to Ripley and then preserved.

=== D2862 ===
D2862 was sold to NCB and it worked on the Norton and Holditch Collieries near Stoke-on-Trent. It was painted into a new light blue livery and was ultimately scrapped after withdrawal.

=== D2865 ===
D2865 was sold to Blue Circle Industries Ltd., Kilverington Gypsum Works where it worked until . It was repainted into a yellow livery.

=== D2866 ===
D2866 was sold to Arnott Young &amp; Co. in Dalmuir Yard and was repainted into a yellow livery. Over time, it began to rust and was renumbered AY1021, but was eventually sold into preservation.

=== D2867 ===
D2867 was sold to Redland Roadstone Ltd, in Barrow upon Soar, having previously been on hire to a Welsh cement company while still technically under BR&#x27;s influence. Redland Roadstone kept the unit until 1995 when it was no longer needed, and sold it to Meadowhall works with hopes that it would be preserved. The unit was painted in Redland Roadstones&#x27;s typical green livery. D2867 was occasionally used while allocated there, most notably in 1987 when it went to Banbury and Derby. The locomotive was one of three in the class to be given a name, in this case Diane, while in industrial use.

=== D2868 ===
D2868 was used alongside 02003 at LCP Fuels at Shut End in the West Midlands, and was given the name Sam. It worked there between 1970 and 1987. It was then given to Meadowhall Works for long store. It did much of its work alongside D2853 Peter, but despite being newer was withdrawn before it. Photos show the two locos working in tandem.

== Preservation ==
There are seven locomotives now in preservation, where their small size makes them suitable as workshop shunters or for use in track maintenance work. One (D2860) is the works shunter for the National Railway Museum in York, where it is used to move much larger exhibits around.
* D2853 &quot;Peter&quot; by Barrow Hill Engine Shed
* D2854 by Heritage Shunters Trust
* D2858 at Midland Railway – Butterley
* D2860 at National Railway Museum, York
* D2866 by Heritage Shunters Trust
* D2867 &quot;Diane&quot; at Battlefield Line Railway
* D2868 &quot;Sam&quot; by Barrow Hill Engine Shed

=== D2853 ===
D2853 was originally sent over to Meadowhall in 1997, before later being transferred to the Rutland Railway Museum and eventually in 2004 to Barrow Hill Engine Shed, where it resides today. The unit is often only posing statically on display however the unit does occasionally move around on its own power, sometimes with other units. In 2006, it was moved to Scunthorpe Steelworks, also known as Appleby Frodingham It was briefly moved back to Barrow Hill on multiple occasions, although it wouldn&#x27;t be until 2016 when it was finally sent there permanently. The unit was painted in BR Green livery as of 2020.

=== D2854 ===
D2854 was purchased from C F Booth in 1989 by the Heritage Shunters Trust, and was originally moved to Meadowhall in 1989, where it was overhauled. It was not seen working on Peak Rail until 2003, where it has continually ran there since.

=== D2858 ===

D2858 was moved to Swanwick Junction in 2002, and in 2004 was repainted into BR Green livery. Since then, D2858 has been preserved in the Midland Railway Centre, and it often runs between Swanwick Junction and Butterley and occasionally further.

=== D2860 ===

D2860 has resided at the National Railway Museum since shortly after it opened and still works there today. It operates as a shunting locomotive which moves other exhibits around, particularly ones which cannot move on their own power, and it is rarely put on display due to the Class 02 being relatively common in preservation.

=== D2866 ===
D2866 started its preserved life in Bridge of Dun on the Caledonian Railway and was still carrying its old livery and number. It was eventually moved to Meadowhall for restoration, and eventually made its way to Rowsley on Peak Rail, where it was dismantled to replace broken parts. It now regularly operates there and is in good condition, and has never left Peak Rail since leaving Meadowhall.

=== D2867 ===
D2867 spent nearly six years in Meadowhall before it was sold to the Battlefield Line Railway in 2001, which is where it resides today. It has, however, been on tour once through Runcorn, Crewe, Nuneaton, Manchester and Warrington. Upon arrival in the Battlefield Line Railway, it was still in its previous industrial livery. The unit has been refurbished by the railway and is in operable condition.

=== D2868 ===
D2868 was stored in Meadowhall until 2004 when it was sold to Barrow Hill Engine Shed, where it resides today. It travelled to Durham in 2006 and to Widnes in 2007. Between 2008 and 2009 it went on loan to Peak Rail, and again in 2013–2014. Between 2012 and 2016, it went to Manchester and was spotted by Deansgate. After 2016, it went back to Barrow Hill where it still resides, mostly on static display, though it is capable of moving under its own traction.

== Technical details ==
The engine is a Rolls-Royce C6NFL176 6-cyl. in-line connected to a Rolls-Royce series 10,000 three-stage twin-disc torque converter and a manually operated YEC reduction and reversing final drive gearbox. The engine and transmission are mounted at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal to allow the overall length and height of the locomotive to be reduced.

Unlike most earlier British Rail shunters, the Class 02s were built with train vacuum brakes.

==Industrial locomotives==
In addition to these locomotives produced for British Railways, around fifty very similar locomotives (most with diesel-electric transmissions and/or more powerful engines) were produced for industrial customers. Many of these can now be found in preservation as well, since few industrial users have their own railways anymore. Quite a few are painted in fictitious British Railways livery and numbering, such as 02 101.

== Model trains ==
The Class 02 will be available as a model in OO gauge from the Danish manufacturers Heljan, and also available in O gauge. It is available for pre-order from several online stores, multiple colour schemes are available.

<text>Vilnius University (Lithuanian: &quot;Vilniaus universitetas&quot;) is a public research university, which is the first and largest university in Lithuania, as well as one of the oldest and most prominent higher education institutions in Central and Eastern Europe. Today, it is Lithuania&#x27;s leading research institution.

The university was founded in 1579 as the Jesuit Academy (College) of Vilnius by Stephen Báthory. It was the third oldest university (after the Cracow Academy and the Albertina) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to the failure of the November Uprising (1830–1831), the university was closed down and suspended its operation until 1919. In the aftermath of World War I, the university saw failed attempts to restart it by the local Poles, Lithuanians, and by invading Soviet forces. It finally resumed operations as Polish Stefan Batory University in August 1919.

After the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, the university was briefly administered by the Lithuanian authorities (from October 1939), and then after Soviet annexation of Lithuania (June 1940), punctuated by a period of German occupation after Operation Barbarossa, from 1941 to 1944, when it was administrated as the Vilnius State University. In 1945, the Polish community of students and scholars of Stefan Batory University was transferred to Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń. After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it resumed its status as one of the prominent universities in Lithuania.

Established in 1579 in Lithuania’s capital city Vilnius, with a faculty in the second-largest city, Kaunas, and another in the fourth-largest city, Šiauliai. The University is composed of fifteen academic faculties that offer more than 200 study programmes in a wide range of academic disciplines for over 24 000 students. Vilnius University is known for its strong community ties, interaction and participation in additional activities offered by the non-academic departments of the University, such as the Cultural Centre, Health and Sports Centre, Library, Museum, Botanical Gardens, and other institutions.

Since 2016, Vilnius University has been a member of a network of prestigious universities–the Coimbra Group–and since 2019, it has belonged to the European University Alliance (ARQUS).The alliance aims to create joint, long-term, sustainable structures and mechanisms for close inter-institutional cooperation in the fields of studies, science and social partnerships. The Vilnius University Foundation was established on 6 April 2016, becoming the first university endowment in Lithuania. The Foundation supports scientific research of the highest quality and the creation of study programmes that correspond to global demands, while encouraging other high added-value projects.

== Academics ==
More than 23,000 students are currently studying in more than 140 Bachelor’s and more than 140 Master’s degree programmes, with PhD studies offered in 29 scientific fields. Students can also choose from more than 60 medicine and dentistry residency programmes.

International students may choose from the 70 study programmes in English in such fields as medicine, odontology, business and management, economics, mathematics and informatics, philology, law, and communications. More than 2500 international students are studying at Vilnius University, which is around 10% of all students.

The University also offers joint study programmes together with foreign higher education institutions, like the Arqus joint Master’s programme “European Studies” and  “Master in International Cybersecurity and Cyberintelligence”. During these collaborative studies, part of the programme takes place at the University, with the other part taking place at a foreign higher education institution. After the completion of these joint studies, a joint qualification degree can be awarded, if the requirements are met.

Vilnius University has over 160 research teams, which are acknowledged across the globe. The university offers over 450 customizable R&amp;D services in diverse areas such as life sciences, photonics, IT, and psychology

By attracting targeted funding or using the University’s funds, the University currently represents the country or participates as a partner in the following international research infrastructures: EMBL; EMBC (European Conference on Molecular Biology); Instruct-ERIC (Structural Biology Infrastructure); ELI (Extreme Light Infrastructure); CERN; WAEVE Consortium (Next Generation Spectroscopy Facility for the William Herschel Telescope); and the Biobanks and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI-ERIC). The Semiconductor Technology Centre (PTC) and the Innovative Chemistry (INOCHEM) Centre are currently being developed. In addition to these research infrastructures, the University is actively involved in other research networks, associations and continuous research activities.

The EMBL Partnership Institute was established in the Vilnius University Life Sciences Centre (LSC), based on an agreement concluded in 2020, the main goal of which is to initiate and develop new directions and technologies in relation to genome editing research and applications in LSC, and to promote the application of genome editing technologies in LSC and Lithuanian research and study institutions and businesses.

From 2021, Vilnius University Business School coordinates and implements Global Entrepreneurship Monitoring (GEM) in Lithuania. GEM is the world&#x27;s largest survey of the state of entrepreneurship, conducted since 1999.

Vilnius University participates in different national and international research projects such as the EU Seventh Framework Programme, Horizon 2020, COST, EUREKA, CERN, etc. To enhance the interrelation between science and business, Vilnius University has established four open access centres aimed at providing access to available research and laboratory equipment not only to students and researchers but also to representatives of business or to personnel of other institutions of science and research.

=== Prominent researchers ===
Professor Virginijus Šikšnys is recognized for his contributions to the development of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, often referred to as &#x27;gene scissors&#x27;. He currently serves as the Head of the Department of Protein–DNA Interactions at the Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University.

Prof. Andrej Spiridonov is famous for the discovery of drivers of evolutionary changes at mega-scale. His latest research suggests that life rather than climate influences diversity at scales greater than 40 million years.

Dr. Mangirdas Malinauskas has been working in laser and optical technologies for more than ten years. At the Laser Research Centre, Dr. M. Malinauskas develops technologies popularly known as ‘4D printing’. Such technologies can produce so-called intelligent objects that can change shape and other properties in response to appropriate conditions: electricity, light, heat, humidity, acidity, solvent composition, etc.

Dr. Linas Mažutis is developing microfluidic technologies at Vilnius University Life Sciences Centre. He is a co-founder of two biotech and biomedical companies. The first one, Platelet BioGenesis, is an allogeneic cell therapy company focused on platelet biology, discovering a new category in therapeutics. He has also co-founded a start-up: the biotechnology company Droplet Genomics. The company’ is based on droplet microfluidic technology, enabling the study of single cells and molecules. One year ago, the company attracted an investment of €1 million.

In 2004, Prof. Valentina Dagienė has established an International Challenge on Informatics and Computational Thinking called BEBRAS (‘Beaver’) which is implemented in over 60 countries. It is an international initiative aiming to promote informatics (Computer Science, or Computing) and computational thinking among school students at all ages. Participants are usually supervised by teachers who may integrate the BEBRAS challenge in their teaching activities. The challenge is performed at schools using computers or mobile devices.

==History==

=== The Foundation of Vilnius University ===

In 1568, the Lithuanian nobility asked the Jesuits to create an institution of higher learning either in Vilnius or Kaunas. The following year Walerian Protasewicz, the bishop of Vilnius, purchased several buildings in the city center and established the Vilnian Academy (Almae Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Jesu). Initially, the academy had three divisions: humanities, philosophy, and theology. The curriculum at the college and later at the academy was taught in Latin. The first students were enrolled into the academy in 1570. A library at the college was established in the same year, and Sigismund II Augustus donated 2500 books to the new college. In its first year of existence the college enrolled 160 students.

Vilnius University was established on April 1, 1579, during the conflict between the Reformation and the Catholic Reformation. Stephan Bathory, the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, granted a charter to create the Vilnius Academy. Later, on October 30, Pope Gregory XIII issued a papal bull, officially recognizing Vilnius College as a university. The institution was formally named Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Iesu (Vilnius Academy and University of the Society of Jesus). The first rector of the academy was Piotr Skarga. He invited many scientists from various parts of Europe and expanded the library, with the sponsorship of many notable persons: Sigismund II Augustus, Bishop Walerian Protasewicz, and Kazimierz Lew Sapieha. Lithuanians at the time comprised about one third of the students (in 1586 there were circa 700 students), others were Germans, Poles, Swedes, and even Hungarians.

In 1575, Duke Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł and Elżbieta Ogińska sponsored a printing house for the academy, one of the first in the region. The printing house issued books in Latin and Polish and the first surviving book in Lithuanian printed in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was in 1595. It was &quot;Kathechismas, arba Mokslas kiekvienam krikščioniui privalus&quot; authored by Mikalojus Daukša.

From its inception, Vilnius University held the authority to award Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s, and Doctoral degrees. As a Jesuit institution, it was one of 23 such universities in Europe during the 16th to 18th centuries. However, in terms of its geographic and cultural reach, Vilnius University was unique. For two centuries, it stood as the easternmost university in Europe. In 1569, Jesuit Baltasarus Hostovinus, after visiting Lithuania, remarked, &quot;No city in the North rivals Vilnius in reputation and livability. It is strategically located near Moscow, the Tatars, and Sweden, and is unmatched in its educational offerings, lacking any nearby universities or prominent schools with qualified Doctors or Masters to instruct.&quot;

The academy&#x27;s growth continued until the 17th century. The Deluge era that followed led to a dramatic drop in the number of students who matriculated and in the quality of its programs. In the middle of the 18th century, education authorities tried to restore the academy. Thanks to the rector of the academy, Marcin Poczobutt-Odlanicki, the academy was granted the status of &quot;Principal School&quot; () in 1783. The commission, the secular authority governing the academy after the dissolution of the Jesuit order, drew up a new statute. The school was named Academia et Universitas Vilnensis.

=== The Old Vilnius University Era ===
Vilnius University was a prominent institution during the Baroque era in Lithuania. The city&#x27;s capital, Vilnius, became a key northern and eastern Baroque city. The Jesuits hired architect Joannes Christophorus Glaubicius from Silesia to repair the University&#x27;s buildings and the Church of St. Johns. Glaubicius, who later became a leading 18th-century architect in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, worked with various religious communities and developed a unique Vilnius Baroque style. In the late 18th century, Vilnius University underwent significant reorganization. This led to the foundation of the first observatory in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (the fourth such professional facility in Europe), in 1753, by Tomasz Żebrowski. The Commission of National Education (), the world&#x27;s first ministry of education, took control of the academy in 1773, and transformed it into a modern University. The language of instruction (as everywhere in the commonwealth&#x27;s higher education institutions) changed from Latin to Polish.

On 3 May 1791, a new generation educated under this curriculum approved the Constitution of Lithuania and Poland, the second written constitution after that of the USA. University professors improved the Astronomical Observatory, established the Botanical Garden, collected various plant and mineral samples, and organized the first expedition to search for natural resources in Lithuania. Even after the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was abolished in 1795, Vilnius University continued its vibrant intellectual life and promoted new ideas in the Natural Sciences. The university also produced renowned poets like Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki, who became leading figures in Polish culture. Simonas Daukantas, a key figure in the Lithuanian movement, was the first to write Lithuania&#x27;s history in the Lithuanian language.
After the Partitions of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Vilnius was annexed by the Russian Empire. However, the Commission of National Education retained control over the academy until 1803, when Tsar Alexander I of Russia accepted the new statute and renamed it The Imperial University of Vilna (Императорскій Виленскій Университетъ). The institution was granted the rights to the administration of all education facilities in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Among the notable personae were the curator (governor) Adam Jerzy Czartoryski and rector Jan Śniadecki.

The university used Polish as the instructional language, although Russian was added to the curriculum. It became known for its studies of Belarusian and Lithuanian culture. By 1823, it was one of the largest in Europe; the student population exceeded that of the Oxford University. A number of students, among them poet Adam Mickiewicz, were arrested in 1823 for conspiracy against the tsar (membership in Filomaci). During the 1831 uprising, many University students joined the rebels. In response, Tsar Nicholas I closed the University on 1 May 1832.

Two of the faculties were turned into separate schools: the Medical and Surgical Academy (&quot;Akademia Medyko-Chirurgiczna&quot;) and the Roman Catholic Academy (&quot;Rzymsko-Katolicka Akademia Duchowna&quot;). But soon they were closed as well with Medical and Surgical Academy transformed into Medical faculty of University of Kyiv (now Bogomolets National Medical University), and latter one being transformed into Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy (after the October Revolution of 1917 moved to Poland where it became Catholic University of Lublin). The repression that followed the failed uprising included banning the Polish and Lithuanian languages; all education in those languages was halted. The first attempts to reestablish scientific institution in Vilnius were made after the 1905 revolution; on 22 October 1906 the Society of Friends of Science in Wilno (TPN) was created by the Polish intelligentsia. After the outbreak of World War I and the German occupation of the city TPN made an attempt to recreate a university with a creation of so-called Higher Scientific Courses. Unfortunately both TPN and the Courses were soon closed by German officials.

=== The University of Stephen Báthory, 1918–1939 ===
During World War I and the subsequent revolutions in Europe, the concept of self-determination led to the emergence of several independent states. Both Lithuania and Poland sought to re-establish their statehood. Plans to reopen the University of Vilnius on January 1, 1919, were disrupted when the Red Army of Soviet Russia occupied Vilnius. In April 1919, the Polish Army took control of the city and removed Soviet structures. Józef Piłsudski then authorized the opening of Stephan Bathory University (SBU) on August 28, 1919.

Lithuanian scholars retreated to Kaunas from the occupied Vilnius. They organized the Higher Courses of Studies, which later evolved into the Lithuanian University in Kaunas, established on February 16, 1922. A few years later, it was renamed Vytautas Magnus University.
The university quickly recovered and gained international prestige, largely because of the presence of notable scientists such as Władysław Tatarkiewicz, Marian Zdziechowski, and Henryk Niewodniczański. Among the students of the university at that time was future Nobel prize winner Czesław Miłosz. The university grew quickly, thanks to government grants and private donations. Its library contained 600,000 volumes, including historic and cartographic items which are still in its possession.

Although the re-established Stephan Bathory University was tasked with promoting Polish state ideology, it also contributed positively through numerous research projects and the training of highly-qualified scientists. Despite being the smallest and most poorly financed Polish university, SBU played a significant role in promoting both Polish and Lithuanian culture and science. In 1945, most of the professors, staff, and students of SBU relocated to Poland, where they initiated the foundation of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń and continued their work there.

The university&#x27;s international students included 212 Russians, 94 Belarusians, 85 Lithuanians, 28 Ukrainians and 13 Germans. Anti-Semitism increased during the 1930s and a system of ghetto benches, in which Jewish students were required to sit in separate areas, was instituted at the university. Violence erupted; the university was closed for two weeks during January 1937. In February Jewish students were denied entrance to its grounds. The faculty was then authorized to decide on an individual basis whether the segregation should be observed in their classrooms and expel those students who would not comply. 54 Jewish students were expelled but were allowed to return the next day under a compromise in which in addition to Jewish students, Lithuanian, Belarusian, and &quot;Polish democratic&quot; students were to be seated separately. Rector of the university, Władysław Marian Jakowicki, resigned his position in protest over the introduction of the ghetto benches.

=== World War II ===
Following the invasion of Poland the university continued its operations. The city was soon occupied by the Soviet Union. Most of the professors returned after the hostilities ended, and the faculties reopened on October 1, 1939. On October 28, Vilnius was transferred to Lithuania which considered the previous eighteen years as an occupation by Poland of its capital. The university was closed on 15 December 1939 by the authorities of the Republic of Lithuania. All the faculty, staff, and its approximately 3,000 students dismissed. Students were ordered to leave the dormitories; 600 ended in a refugee camp. Professors had to leave their university flats. Following the Lithuanization policies, in its place, a new university, named Vilniaus universitetas, was created. Its faculty came from the Kaunas University. The new charter specified that Vilnius University was to be governed according to the statute of the Vytautas Magnus University of Kaunas, and that Lithuanian language programs and faculties would be established. Lithuanian was named as the official language of the university. A new academic term started on 22 January; only 13 of the new students had former Polish citizenship.

Polish Law and Social Sciences, Humanities, Medical, Theological, Mathematical-Life sciences faculties continued to work underground with lectures and exams held in private flats until 1944. Polish professors who took part in the underground courses included Iwo Jaworski, Kazimierz Petrusewicz and Bronisław Wróblewski. The diplomas of the underground universities were accepted by many Polish universities after the war. Soon after the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, while some Polish professors were allowed to resume teaching, many others (along with some Lithuanian professors) who were deemed &quot;reactionary&quot; were arrested and sent to prisons and gulags in Russia and Kazakhstan. Between September 1939 and July 1941, the Soviets arrested and deported nineteen Polish faculty and ex-faculty of the University of Stefan Batory, of who nine perished: Professors Stanisław Cywinski, Władysław Marian Jakowicki, Jan Kempisty, Józef Marcinkiewicz, Tadeusz Kolaczyński, Piotr Oficjalski, Włodzimierz Godłowski, Konstanty Pietkiewicz, and Konstanty Sokol-Sokolowski, the last five victims of the Katyn massacre.

The city was occupied by Germany in 1941, and all institutions of higher education for Poles were closed. From 1940 until September 1944, under Lithuanian professor and activist Mykolas Biržiška, the University of Vilnius was open for Lithuanian students under the supervision of the German occupation authorities. In 1944, many of Polish students took part in Operation Ostra Brama. The majority of them were later arrested by the NKVD and suffered repressions from their participation in the Armia Krajowa resistance.

===Soviet period (1945-1990)===
The sovietisation of Vilnius University, which started in the summer of 1940, continued after World War II. Furthermore, the University community suffered some major upheavals during the Nazi occupation. On the order of the Nazi occupying authorities, all Jewish teachers and later all Polish and Jewish students were expelled from the University. Nearly all the Jewish members of the University community subsequently became victims of the Holocaust. In the summer of 1944, a few dozen former University lecturers retreated to the West, in fear of possible repression by the Soviet Regime. The arrests of lecturers started at the beginning of 1945 and continued until Stalin’s death. Even more professors were dismissed on political grounds.

Educated Poles were transferred to People&#x27;s Republic of Poland after World War II under the guidance of State Repatriation Office. As the result, many former students and professors of Stefan Batory joined universities in Poland. To keep in contact with each other, the professors decided to transfer whole faculties. After 1945, most of the mathematicians, humanists and biologists joined the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, while a number of the medical faculty formed the core of the newly founded Medical University of Gdańsk. The Toruń university is often considered to be the successor to the Polish traditions of Stefan Batory University.

Many famous scientists ended up on the list of the victims of Stalinist terror, including Antanas Žvironas, Tadas Petkevičius, Levas Karsavinas and Vosylius Sezemanas, among others. During the post-Stalin period, when the classical Vilnius University had been converted into a Soviet university and in 1955 was awarded the name of the Vilnius Order of the Red Banner of Labour State University of Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas, there were no more mass repressions against the University community. However, separate cases of political persecution still occurred. One of the best-known cases was that instituted against the Department of Lithuanian Literature that lasted from 1958 to 1961, after which four teachers from the Department were forced to leave the University. The 1960s could be considered as a prominent threshold in the historical development of Vilnius University. During that period, the University was finally converted into a typical higher education institution, where priority was given to a specialised and simultaneously ideologised technocratic education rather than to the development of a full-fledged personality.

===After 1990===

On 12 June 1990, the Supreme Council of Lithuania-Restoration Seimas approved the Statute of Vilnius University, declaring the autonomy of the University, which was granted by the Law on Science and Studies in 1991.

In 1991, the University signed the Great Charter of European Universities – the main declaration of the academic freedom, rights and responsibilities of European universities – thus expressing its goal to re-shape Vilnius University. Moreover, the study programmes at the University were reorganised into three cycles at the Bachelor, Master and Doctoral (or PhD) level.

In 2016, Vilnius University joined the Coimbra Group, a network of prestigious European universities.

Also in 2016, Vilnius University started the Recovering Memory project. The University recognises its responsibility to remember and evaluate the past, especially the tragic events that took place in the pre-war and post-war Lithuania, particularly at Vilnius University. The aim of the project is to commemorate and pay respect to the members of the Vilnius University community, both staff and students, who were expelled from the university, losing the ability to continue their academic careers or studies, because of the actions of the totalitarian regimes and their local collaborators. The symbolic Memory Diploma of Vilnius University has been established in commemoration of these people.

Vilnius University is a member of The Arqus European University Alliance that brings together the Universities of Granada, Graz, Leipzig, Lyon 1, Maynooth, Minho, Padua, Vilnius and Wroclaw.

===Library, Museum and Botanical Garden===

Vilnius University Library is an academic library of national significance that was founded back in 1570 in Vilnius. As the earliest academic library in the Baltic region, it has holdings of over five million documents, with about 45 thousand registered users and it employs over 200 people. The library consists of the Central Library and the Scholarly Communication and Information Centre (SCIC), as well as libraries for the faculties and centres. The Central Library still works in the authentic 16th-century premises. 5.1 million publications are kept in the Library. The pride of the Library is its collections of old printed books, manuscripts, old engravings and other special collections.

The Scholarly Communication and Information Centre (SCIC) is the part of the library, equipped with most advanced technologies and situated on Saulėtekis Avenue.

The Vilnius University Museum started its activities during the University’s 431st anniversary, on 1 April 2010.  The basis for the new university museum was the old Vilnius University Museum of Progressive Scientific Thought, which was established in the Church of St. Johnson 16 September 1979. The Vilnius University Museum also consists of the Church of St. Johns Bell Tower, Adam Mickiewicz Museum and the Astronomical Observatory on Čiurlionis Street.  The museum organises guided tours, educational activities and events.

Botanical Garden – University’s Botanical Garden has been relocated four times. The first Botanical Garden was arranged in the courtyard of Collegium Medicum (Pilies Street 22) in 1781-1799. The core of the Garden was a collection of plants brought by Professor Jean Emmanuel Gilibert from Grodno. The second Garden flourished in Sereikiškės during 1799-1842. In 1919, the Garden was recreated in the territory of Vingis Manor House (M. K. Čiurliono Street 110) and was then relocated to a suburb in the territory of Kairėnai Manor House in 1974.

<text>Helichrysum sanguineum, known in English as red everlasting and red cudweed, is a flowering plant of the genus &quot;Helichrysum&quot; in the family Asteraceae. It grows in mountain forests in the Levant where it blooms in April–June. The flower, known in Hebrew as &quot;Blood of the Maccabees&quot;, has become the icon of Yom Hazikaron, Memorial Day for Israel&#x27;s Fallen Soldiers and Victims of Terrorism.

==Name==
&quot;Helichrysum sanguineum&quot; (L.) Kostel is not to be mistaken for &quot;Helichrysum sanguineum&quot; Boiss. = &quot;Gnaphalium sanguineum&quot; L., which is known in English as sowbread or cyclamen.

In Arabic, the flower is known as &quot;دم المسيح&quot; (&quot;dam al-Massiah&quot;), meaning &quot;blood of the Messiah&quot;/&quot;blood of Christ&quot;.

In Hebrew, it is known as &quot;blood of the Maccabees&quot; (, &quot;dam hamakabim&quot;). The name is derived from a legend saying that in every spot where the flower grows, a drop of blood has spilled on the earth.

==History==
The Hebrew name &quot;Dam hamakabim&quot; was coined by the botanist Ephraim Hareuveni in 1917. The symbolic connection to Israeli war casualties first appeared in a poem by Haim Gouri written in memory of 35 Palmach comrades killed in January 1948. Since 2019, the non-profit organization Dam HaMaccabim has been distributing pins with the flower throughout Israel.

==Distribution==
The plant grows in the Levant, including: western Syria, the Mediterranean coast of Lebanon and Mount Lebanon up to an altitude of 1000 m, on the Golan Heights, in most of the northern and central part of Israel and the West Bank (Upper and Lower Galilee, around the Sea of Galilee, on Mount Carmel and the Coastal Plain south of it, Mount Gilboa, the northern part of the Jordan Valley, Samaria, the Judaean Mountains and the Shefela), and the mountainous Gilead region in Jordan (the areas of Jarash and Dibeen, Ajloun, and Al-Salt).

In Israel, &quot;Helichrysum sanguineum&quot; is a endangered species.
