<text>Delilah ( ; , meaning &quot;delicate&quot;; ; ) is a woman mentioned in the sixteenth chapter of the Book of Judges in the Hebrew Bible. She is loved by Samson, a Nazirite who possesses great strength and serves as the final Judge of Israel. Delilah is bribed by the lords of the Philistines to discover the source of his strength. After three failed attempts at doing so, she finally goads Samson into telling her that his vigor is derived from his hair. As he sleeps, Delilah calls a servant to cut Samson&#x27;s hair, thereby enabling her to turn him over to the Philistines.

Delilah has been the subject of both rabbinic and Christian commentary; rabbinic literature identifies her with Micah&#x27;s mother in the biblical narrative of Micah&#x27;s Idol, while some Christians have compared her to Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed Jesus. Scholars have noted similarities between Delilah and other women in the Bible, such as Jael and Judith, and have discussed the question of whether the story of Samson&#x27;s relationship with Delilah displays a negative attitude towards foreigners. Notable depictions of Delilah include John Milton&#x27;s closet drama &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; and Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1949 Hollywood film &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. Her name has become associated with treacherous and voluptuous women.

==In the Bible==

Delilah was a woman of Sorek. She is the only woman in Samson&#x27;s story who is named. The Bible says that Samson loved her () but not that she loved him. The two were not said to be married and the idea that they had a sexual relationship is, in the words of Josey Bridges Snyder, &quot;at most implicit in the biblical text&quot;. The lords of the Philistines bribed her to discover the source of Samson&#x27;s great strength, each offering to give her 1,100 silver coins. Three times she failed.

First, at his own suggestion, she bound him with &quot;seven green withes,&quot; but these he easily snapped asunder. Then she tied him with new ropes: these also failed. Then, she fastened the locks of his hair to the loom but with the same result. Finally, after many complaints that Samson did not trust her, he told her that his strength lay in his Nazirite vow, symbolized by his uncut hair. The Hebrew text of the Bible says she cut Samson&#x27;s hair while he slept; other variations of the text say &quot;a man&quot; or &quot;a barber&quot; cut Samson&#x27;s hair. She then awoke him, and delivered him into the hands of the waiting Philistine chiefs.

The Bible does not mention her fate, and, as James D. G. Dunn and John William Rogerson note in &quot;Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible&quot;, it never discusses whether Delilah felt guilt for her actions.

==Religious views==
===Jewish interpretations===

Josephus and Pseudo-Philo both view Delilah as a Philistine and a prostitute; Josey Bridges Snyder theorizes that this may be due to the fact that Book of Judges portrays Samson as being attracted to both Philistine women () and prostitutes (). Pseudo-Philo also writes that Delilah was Samson&#x27;s wife. The Talmud says that Delilah used sex to get Samson to reveal his secret, in spite of the fact that the biblical text does not state that the two had a sexual relationship, while midrash state that Delilah harassed Samson verbally and physically during sex to get him to tell her the source of his strength. Midrashim on Delilah reveal negative attitudes toward non-Jewish women and are supposed to &quot;demonstrate the havoc that a foreign woman could wreak&quot;. The midrash says that Samson lost his strength because of his relationship with Delilah, a foreign woman, and not because his hair was cut, and that the angel who foretold Samson&#x27;s birth to his mother knew that Delilah would cause him to break his Nazirite vow.

The Jewish sages said Delilah&#x27;s name implies what she did to Samson (&quot;She dwindles&quot;). Because Samson allowed his spiritual state to become diminished, he was vulnerable to losing his strength by having his hair cut. Even before Delilah is mentioned, the length of Samson&#x27;s career is described. Normally the length of someone&#x27;s life or career in the Old Testament is mentioned last for a character to signify the end of his relevance to the narrative. David Kimhi notes that it is mentioned at the peak of his career; which implies that mentions of Samson afterwards marks his decline and downfall. This might explain why Samson eventually told Delilah of his weakness, even though she repeatedly betrayed him before. It is possible he was not fully aware that cutting his hair would cause God to allow him to lose his strength; since it was actually the decline of his spiritual state that caused him to lose God&#x27;s favor.

Late aggadah say that Samson and Delilah had sons together who were strong like their father; Eldad ha-Dani claims that their sons resided in the land of Havilah and each had voices as &quot;triumphal...as a lion&#x27;s roar&quot;. Medieval midrash propose that Delilah was the mother of Micah from the biblical narrative of Micah&#x27;s Idol. This theory rests on the fact that, in , Micah&#x27;s mother gives her son 1,100 silver coins to construct his idol, similar to how Delilah was promised 1,100 silver coins to betray her lover by the Philistine leaders. This tradition explains the conflation of Delilah and Micah&#x27;s mother by noting that Bible introduces the narrative of Micah&#x27;s Idol immediately after the narrative of Samson and Delilah. Rashi disputes this theory, as the Seder Olam Rabbah states that Micah and Samson were not contemporaries and that Micah lived during the time of Othniel.

===Christian interpretations===

Most Christian commentary on Delilah condemns her. Saint Ambrose represents Delilah as a Philistine prostitute and declares that &quot;men should avoid marriage with those outside the faith, lest, instead of love of one&#x27;s spouse, there be treachery.&quot; Marbodius of Rennes uses the examples of Delilah, Eve, Lot&#x27;s daughters, Herodias, Clytemnestra, and Procne to illustrate that women are a &quot;pleasant evil, at once a honeycomb and a poison&quot;. Samson&#x27;s betrayal by Delilah has also been compared to Jesus&#x27; betrayal by Judas Iscariot; both Delilah and Judas were paid in pieces of silver for their respective deeds. However, Thomas de Vio Cajetan views Delilah in a somewhat sympathetic light, suggesting that she never intended Samson to be killed or wounded. He asserts that Delilah accepted a bribe from the Philistine leaders because they convinced her that Samson would merely be weakened.

Caesarius of Arles views Delilah&#x27;s temptation of Samson as similar to Satan&#x27;s temptation of Christ. Isidore of Seville does see Samson as prefiguring Christ, but argues that &quot;in yielding to Delilah, Samson did not prefigure Christ. Instead he exemplified the fall of the sinful man&quot;. Similarly, Billy Graham sees Samson&#x27;s eyes being gouged out after he was handed over to the Philistines as his punishment for succumbing to his lust for Delilah; Graham also sees this as an example of the concept that . Joyce Meyer writes that Satan worked through Delilah, as he was aware that Samson had &quot;a weakness for women&quot;. Meyer sees Delilah&#x27;s relationship with Samson as an example of how the devil exploits people&#x27;s weaknesses.

==Scholarly views==

Delilah is usually thought to have been a Philistine, although she is not identified as such in the Bible. The name &quot;Delilah&quot; is a Hebrew name, however, numerous foreigners in the Bible have Hebrew names, so Delilah&#x27;s name cannot be seen as indisputable proof that she was Hebrew. J. Cheryl Exum of the Jewish Women&#x27;s Archive argues that the author of the Book of Judges would probably not portray Delilah in a negative light if she were a fellow Israelite. Samson was attracted to Philistine women; he had previously been married to one. Exum writes that the arguments that Delilah was a Philistine are inconclusive, while the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; says that Delilah was a Philistine in all probability.

Dolores G. Kamrada write in &quot;Heroines, Heroes and Deity: Three Narratives of the Biblical Heroic Tradition&quot; that Delilah is similar to Jael, a woman mentioned in the fourth and fifth chapters of the Book of Judges who murders Sisera by driving a tent peg into his head, and frequently compared to the title character of the Book of Judith, who beheads Holofernes; all three women defeat powerful warriors. According to Susan Ackerman, Delilah differs from Jael and Judith in that she &quot;sells out to the enemy, rather than the other way around&quot;.

Some scholarly commentary on Delilah centers on her gender. In the &quot;Feminist Companion to Judges&quot;, Carol Smith says that feminist commentators tend to stress Delilah&#x27;s positive qualities, explain her negative ones, or ignore her in favor of &quot;other biblical women who are more amenable to reinterpretation in a positive way&quot;. James D. G. Dunn and John William Rogerson feel that the Bible portrays Delilah as &quot;a doubly dangerous woman given her apparent independence&quot;, noting that she is not &quot;identified by a male relationship – the wife, daughter or sister of anyone&quot; but simply &quot;appears in her own right&quot;. Conversely, Phillip Lopate writes &quot;while the message of Samson&#x27;s fall, like Adam&#x27;s, would seem to be cautionary and misogynistic, underneath we see his time with Delilah as a liberating fantasy...Don&#x27;t we secretly rejoice at his having the good sense to follow the route of his desire, to free himself from the &#x27;good boy&#x27; Nazirite onus by putting himself in temptation&#x27;s way?&quot;

&quot;Haaretz&quot;″s Elon Gilad writes &quot;some biblical stories are flat-out cautions against marrying foreign women, none more than the story of Samson&quot;, noting that Samson&#x27;s relationship with Delilah leads to his demise. He contrasts this to what he sees as a more positive portrayal of intermarriage in the Book of Ruth. James D. G. Dunn and John William Rogerson say in &quot;Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible&quot; that Delilah exemplifies an important theme in the Book of Judges – a fear of assimilation. They see the narratives of Samson, Gideon, and Jephthah as cautionary tales against men choosing partners who could create &quot;impure offspring&quot;. Melissa A. Jackson, in &quot;Comedy and Feminist Interpretation of the Hebrew Bible: A Subversive Collaboration&quot;, says that the Bible delineates between &quot;good&quot; foreigners like Tamar, Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, Rahab, and Ruth, and &quot;bad&quot; foreigners like Jezebel and Delilah.
Contrariwise, Elizabeth Wurtzel sees Samson&#x27;s relationship with Delilah as &quot;the archetypal story of cross-cultural love between members of warring nations&quot;, akin to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

==Cultural influence==

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Delilah&#x27;s name has &quot;become synonymous with a voluptuous, treacherous woman&quot;. The use of the name &quot;Delilah&quot; to connote deceit or betrayal can be found in works such as H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1897), the Tom Jones song &quot;Delilah&quot; (1968), Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1986), and Pat Conroy&#x27;s &quot;Beach Music&quot; (1995). In &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, her name is applied to cunning women.

Delilah also appears as a character in a number of works of art. John Milton&#x27;s closet drama &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, an allegory for the downfall of the Puritans and the restoration of the English monarchy, casts Delilah as an unrepentant, but sympathetic, deceiver and speaks approvingly of the subjugation of women. Scottish poet Carol Ann Duffy included an eponymously titled poem written from Delilah’s perspective in her poetry collection, &quot;The World’s Wife&quot;.

In 1735, George Frideric Handel wrote the opera &quot;Samson&quot;, with a libretto by Newburgh Hamilton, based on &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;. The opera is almost entirely set inside Samson&#x27;s prison and Delilah appears only briefly in Act II. In 1877, Camille Saint-Saëns composed the opera &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; with a libretto by Ferdinand Lemaire in which the entire story of Samson and Delilah is retold. In the libretto, Delilah is portrayed as a seductive &quot;femme fatale&quot;, but the music played during her parts invokes sympathy for her. The narrative of Samson and Delilah is retold in indie pop singer Regina Spektor&#x27;s &quot;Samson&quot; (2002), which includes the lyrics &quot;I cut his hair myself one night / A pair of dull scissors and the yellow light / And he told me that I&#x27;d done alright.&quot;

The 1949 Biblical drama &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, directed by Cecil B. DeMille and starring Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr in the titular roles, was widely praised by critics for its cinematography, lead performances, costumes, sets, and innovative special effects. It became the highest-grossing film of 1950 and was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning two. According to Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the film depicts Delilah as &quot;a much more noble creature than legend would lead us to suppose&quot;. In &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, Delilah is the sister of Samson&#x27;s wife, and repents cutting off his hair. When Samson prepares to collapse the pillars, Delilah does not follow Samson&#x27;s advice to get out and she dies alongside him when the temple collapses. Actresses who have portrayed Delilah besides Lamarr include Belinda Bauer in &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1984), and Elizabeth Hurley in &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1996).

<text>&quot;Bart of Darkness&quot; is the premiere of the sixth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on September 4, 1994. In the episode, Bart breaks his leg and becomes increasingly isolated. Spying on Ned Flanders from his room, Bart suspects that Ned has murdered his wife. The episode was produced during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which delayed production by a month, and it was originally going to be the season five finale and is largely a parody of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954).

The episode was written by Dan McGrath and directed by Jim Reardon.

==Plot==
During a heatwave, Bart and Lisa persuade Homer to buy a swimming pool for their backyard after a day of swimming in a mobile pool truck. Once the backyard pool is up and running, the family holds a town-wide pool party that ends with Bart breaking his leg in an attempt to dive into the pool from the tree house; after a hospital visit, Bart is ordered to spend the rest of the summer wearing a full cast over his broken leg, leaving him unable to swim in the pool or socialize with any of the other children. To cheer him up, Lisa gets Bart a telescope, which he uses to spy on other town residents. Bart becomes gradually more concerned about his next door neighbor Ned Flanders after he first hears a womanly scream from his house, and later witnesses Ned digging a grave in the backyard and remorsefully calling himself a &quot;murderer&quot;. The next day, Bart overhears Ned telling his sons Rod and Todd that their mother is &quot;with God&quot; and they will soon join her. All of this leads Bart to believe that Ned has killed his wife Maude and is now planning to do the same to their children.

Lisa revels in her newfound popularity with the schoolkids as a direct result of the swimming pool, until the other children abandon her in favor of Martin Prince, whose family now has an even bigger backyard pool than the Simpsons. Without the attention from the other kids, Lisa soon notices Bart&#x27;s fears of what Ned might be up to, and she reluctantly agrees to help him investigate by sneaking into the Flanders house while Ned is away. However, Ned unexpectedly comes home early and Lisa hides upstairs, causing Bart to chase after Ned. The three of them soon meet in the attic where Bart accuses Ned, who faints from the shock. 

After the police arrive to question Ned, they discover that Maude is alive and well, having just returned from her time &quot;with God&quot; at a Bible camp in the countryside. Bart presses Ned about the grave in his backyard, forcing Ned to tearfully confess that he dug the grave for one of Maude&#x27;s houseplants after realizing it was overwatered. When Ned sees the police have unearthed the dead plant from his backyard, he lets out a high-pitched scream which Bart recognizes as the womanly scream he originally heard. Martin&#x27;s turn as the new popular kid goes well until he overestimates the capacity of the new pool, which quickly breaks apart from the physical stress. Nelson rips off Martin&#x27;s swim trunks, and the schoolkids all walk away in anger. Martin, naked and alone amid the wreckage, solemnly sings &quot;Summer Wind&quot; as he watches the sunset.

==Production==
For season six, Fox moved &quot;The Simpsons&quot; back to its original Sunday night time of 8 pm, having aired on Thursdays for the previous four seasons. It has remained in this slot ever since.

Dan McGrath was chosen to write the episode, while Jim Reardon directed. The episode was originally produced as the season finale of the fifth season, but was held over and aired as the premiere of the sixth. This was because the episode, along with &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot;, was in production at the time of the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The earthquake damaged much of the Film Roman building in which &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writing and animation staff worked, forcing them to move out for three months and continue production in a temporary building. The only staff members that came in expecting to work were future show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. As a result, the staff was given a month more than they would usually have had to work on the episode, which Reardon described as &quot;greatly benefiting&quot; it. Having been a director on the series for five years, he believed that this episode &quot;was closer to what [he] was trying to achieve as a director than [he] had done before&quot;. He credited this to the extra time, and used it to insert little details, such as having Bart get stuck on the fabric of the chair he was in, and wearing his underwear instead of a swimsuit.

Many of the heatwave jokes at the start of the episode were based on events from the crew&#x27;s lives. The sitting in front of the fridge-freezer joke came from McGrath, who had done something similar as a child. The Springfield Pool-Mobile was based on a similar vehicle from David Mirkin&#x27;s childhood, where a truck with a &quot;spinning cars&quot; fairground ride on the back would often come around his neighborhood. Flanders&#x27; feminine scream was performed by Tress MacNeille and not his regular voice actor Harry Shearer. Krusty&#x27;s mispronunciation of Ravi Shankar&#x27;s name was an ad-lib that Mirkin kept in after the editing process because he liked it so much.

==Cultural references==

The title is a reference to Joseph Conrad&#x27;s 1899 novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. Springfield&#x27;s wax museum features models of The Beatles and the original cast of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. The barn building scene with the onlooking Amish man is a reference to Peter Weir&#x27;s film &quot;Witness&quot;. The pool dance scene sees Lisa in a role reminiscent of Esther Williams. The &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; episode title references &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, with the mutants being a reference to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Menagerie&quot;. The first Klassic Krusty episode is dated February 6, 1961. Krusty&#x27;s guest was AFL–CIO chairman George Meany.
The third act is largely a parody of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot;. As in the film, a crippled Bart witnesses an apparent murder through his telescope, with the original musical cues also being used. James Stewart&#x27;s character, L. B. &quot;Jeff&quot; Jefferies, appears twice, caricatured as his initial film appearance. The pictures on the wall of Jeff&#x27;s room are the same as in &quot;Rear Window&quot;. At the end of the episode, Martin begins to sing Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Summer Wind&quot;; the song then continues instrumentally over the closing credits, instead of the show&#x27;s usual theme music.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
In this original American broadcast, &quot;Bart of Darkness&quot; finished 44th in the ratings for the week of August 29 to September 4, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 8.9 and an audience share of 17. The episode was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week.

===Critical reception===
Mike Duffy praised the episode, stating it showed that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was &quot;just as strong and funny as it ever was&quot;.

Elaine Liner of the &quot;Corpus Christi Caller-Times&quot; praised the writing as &quot;crisp, hilarious and multi-layered&quot;, praising its many cultural references and noting the &quot;biting commentary&quot; of Maude Flanders&#x27; line, &quot;I was at Bible camp learning to be more judgmental&quot;. Later reviews shared these sentiments.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, found that the &quot;eventual explanation for [Flanders&#x27;] murderous behavior is hilarious&quot;. Tim Knight called it &quot;a terrific opener to the season&quot;.

Erik Adams, in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, writes that &quot;&#x27;Bart Of Darkness&#x27; starts &quot;The Simpsons&quot;’ sixth season off on the right foot with a full-bodied embrace of its source material and a comedic core that challenges traditional TV logic. The episode may have marked the show’s induction into the television establishment, but it would be many more years before any of its well-honed edges would be blunted by complacency.

<text>Jacques Philippe Villeré (April 28, 1761 – March 7, 1830) was the second Governor of Louisiana after it became a state. He was the first Creole and the first native of Louisiana to hold that office.

==Early life==
He was born in 1761 near present-day Kenner, Louisiana, on his maternal grandfather&#x27;s plantation &quot;La Providence.&quot; 

His father was Joseph Antoine de Villeré, an official in the French Navy during the reign of King Louis XV and later a colonial militia captain in the German Coast area of present-day southeast Louisiana. A few years after 1763&#x27;s cession of &quot;La Louisiane&quot; to Spain, Joseph was sentenced to death by Spanish Governor Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly, who was sent by King Charles III to suppress a local revolt. Joseph Villeré mysteriously died prior to the firing squad execution of the rebels, in October 1769. Jacques Villeré&#x27;s grandfather, Etienne Roy de Villeré, had accompanied Iberville on the voyage from France to the Gulf coast, late in the 17th century, during the reign of Louis XIV.

Jacques&#x27;s mother was Louise Marguerite de la Chaise, daughter of Jacques de la Chaise and granddaughter, on her mother&#x27;s side, of Charles Frederick d’Arensbourg.

==Military service==
Villeré joined the French Army and was educated for two years in France at the Crown&#x27;s expense, due to his father&#x27;s death at the hands of O&#x27;Reilly. In 1776, while still an adolescent, he was assigned to Saint-Domingue as a first lieutenant in the artillery. His mother&#x27;s death in the 1780s brought him back to settle in Louisiana (New Spain), which became again a possession of France in 1800 and finally of the United States in 1803 through the Louisiana Purchase.

In 1814–15, he served with distinction in the (War of 1812&#x27;s) Battle of New Orleans, as a major general commanding the 1st Division of the Louisiana Militia. His men stood fast, assigned to the area near Lake Borgne and Bayou Dupre, as British forces approached New Orleans by sea.

The Villeré plantation, &quot;Conseil&quot;, located downriver from the city, was overrun by the British. In fact, Villeré&#x27;s son Gabriel, who had the rank of major and guarded the plantation with thirty soldiers, was surprised and captured when the British Army initially made its presence known. Maj. Villeré managed to escape and report the news to Gen. Andrew Jackson, who ordered the night attack of December 23, 1814.

The Villeré home was used as British headquarters throughout the Louisiana campaign for nearly one month. The family&#x27;s property was damaged and they lost a number of slaves, who were taken aboard Royal Navy vessels and later freed.

==Family, political career, and later life==
In 1784, Villeré married Jeanne Henriette de Fazende, the daughter of Gabriel de Fazende, who owned a plantation seven miles (11 km) below New Orleans in present-day Saint Bernard Parish. The couple raised eight children. Jeanne Villeré died in 1826.

In 1803, Villeré secured a seat on the municipal council (the &quot;Cabildo&quot;) of New Orleans during the brief return to French colonial administration. The next year, after the Louisiana Purchase took effect, Villeré was appointed a major general in the territorial militia, a Police Juror in what in a few years would be the &quot;county&quot; of Orleans Parish, and a justice of the peace for the area which would soon become St. Bernard Parish.

Villeré was a member of the convention which drafted Louisiana&#x27;s first state constitution. He ran for Governor in 1812, to serve as the first governor after statehood, but was defeated in the election by William C. C. Claiborne who was elected overwhelmingly with over 70% of the vote.

Jacques Villeré was elected as the second state governor in 1816, narrowly defeating Joshua Lewis. He took office in December of that year and served through 1820, a period of prosperity and growth for the new state. His gubernatorial administration was noted for efforts to provide bankruptcy protection for debtors, the designation of death-by-dueling as a capital offense, and reduction of the level of state debt.

He retired to the family&#x27;s sugar plantation in St. Bernard Parish after his term, as the law did not permit him to succeed himself in office. Villeré was brought out of retirement to run again for governor in the 1824 election, but he and Bernard de Marigny split the Creole vote and Henry Johnson was elected governor.

He was preparing to run for Governor again in the 1830 special election; but he died March 7, 1830, before the election, at the plantation &quot;Conseil&quot; after a long illness. His remains were interred at St. Louis Cemetery No. 2, in New Orleans.

<text>The wood stork (Mycteria americana) is a large wading bird in the family Ciconiidae (storks). Originally described in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, this stork is native to the subtropics and tropics of the Americas where it persists in habitats with fluctuating water levels. It is the only stork species that breeds in North America. The head and neck are bare of feathers, and dark grey in colour. The plumage is mostly white, with the exception of the tail and some of the wing feathers, which are black with a greenish-purplish sheen.

Globally, the wood stork is considered to be of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the United States, the wood stork was previously classified as Endangered due to loss of suitable feeding habitat in the Florida Everglades, its historical population stronghold in the country. The species has been subsequently downlisted to Threatened after northward range expansion and increased population size.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The wood stork was first formally given its binomial name &quot;Mycteria americana&quot; by Linnaeus in 1758. Linnaeus originally named two separate species, &quot;M. americana&quot; and &quot;Tantalus loculator&quot;, based on different and slightly erroneous accounts, in his book Systema Naturae. It was later identified that these binomials referred to the same species, making &quot;M. americana&quot; and &quot;T. loculator&quot; synonymous. &quot;M. americana&quot; takes priority as it occurs before &quot;T. loculator&quot;. 

The accepted genus name &quot;Mycteria&quot; derives from the Greek μυκτήρ : &quot;myktēr&quot;, meaning snout or trunk, and the species name &quot;americana&quot; references the distribution of this stork.

Likely because of its decurved bill, the wood stork has formerly been called the &quot;wood ibis&quot;, although it is not an ibis. It also has been given the name of the &quot;American wood stork&quot;, because it is found in the Americas. Regional names include &quot;flinthead&quot;, &quot;stonehead&quot;, &quot;ironhead&quot;, &quot;gourdhead&quot;, and &quot;preacher&quot;.

The wood stork is classified within the tribe Mycteriini (which encompasses all species of genera &quot;Anastomus&quot; and &quot;Mycteria&quot;) based on morphology and behaviour.
== Description ==

The adult wood stork is a large bird which stands tall with a wingspan of . The male typically weighs , with a mean weight of ; the female weighs , with a mean weight of . Another estimate puts the mean weight at . The head and neck of the adult are bare, and the scaly skin is a dark grey. The black downward-curved bill is long and very wide at the base. The plumage is mostly white, with the , , and tail being black and having a greenish and purplish iridescence. The legs and feet are dark, and the pink/beige-coloured toes are pink during the breeding season. The sexes are similar.

Newly hatched chicks have a sparse coat of grey down () that is replaced by a dense, wooly, and white down () in about 10 days. Chicks grow fast, being about half the height of adults in three to four weeks. By the sixth and seventh weeks, the plumage on the head and neck turns smokey grey. When fledged, they resemble the adult, differing only in that they have a feathered head and a yellow bill.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The current range of the wood stork includes the southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, Cuba, and South America. 

Within the United States, small breeding populations exist in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. Post-breeding birds in the United States can be found as far west as Alabama and Mississippi. 

In Mexico, non-breeding birds can be found along both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, while breeding colonies are restricted to the Pacific coast. Most descriptions of wood stork breeding colonies in western Mexico are over 35 years old, but recent sources have confirmed active nesting colonies in the southwestern states of Oaxaca and Colima.

Cuba contains the only two known breeding locations for wood storks in the Caribbean. Both colonies exist in important wetlands - Zapata Swamp and the Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago. Outside of Cuba, sightings of wood storks are rare in the Caribbean as the birds were extirpated from Hispaniola and are vagrants on other Caribbean islands.

In South America, the wood stork is found south to northern Argentina. Most breeding colonies in Brazil are concentrated in the Pantanal wetland and the northern coastal region. Birds that breed in west-central Brazil often disperse to southern Brazil and northern Argentina after breeding.

The wood stork is able to adapt to a variety of tropical and subtropical wetland habitats having fluctuating water levels, which initiate breeding. It nests in trees that are over water or surrounded by water. In freshwater habitats, it primarily nests in forests dominated by trees of the genus &quot;Taxodium&quot; (in the USA), while in estuaries, it generally nests on trees in the mangrove forests. To feed, the wood stork uses freshwater marshes in habitats with an abundance of &quot;Taxodium&quot; trees, while in areas with mangrove forests, it uses brackish water. Areas with more lakes attract feeding on lake, stream, and river edges.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
=== Breeding ===

A resident breeder in lowland wetlands, the wood stork builds large () nests in trees. In freshwater habitats, it prefers to nest in trees that are larger in diameter. It nests colonially, with up to 25 nests in one tree. The height of these nests is variable, with some nests located in shorter mangrove trees being at heights of about , compared to a height of about for taller mangrove trees. For &quot;Taxodium&quot; trees, it generally nests near the top branches, frequently between above the ground. On the tree itself, forks of large limbs or places where multiple branches cross are usually chosen.

The nest itself is built by the male from sticks and green twigs collected from the colony and the surrounding area. The greenery usually starts to be added before the eggs are laid but after the main structure of twigs is completed. The frequency at which it is added decreases after the eggs hatch. This greenery functions to help insulate the nest. When complete, the nest is about in diameter, with a central green area having an average diameter of about . The thickness of the edge of the nest usually measures from .
Wood storks without a nest occasionally try to take over others&#x27; nests. Such nest take-overs are performed by more than one bird. The young and eggs are thrown out of the nest within about 15 minutes. If only one stork is attending the nest when it is forced out, then it usually waits for its mate to try to take the nest back over.

Breeding is initiated by a drop in the water level combined with an increased density of fish (with the former likely triggering the latter). This is because a decrease in the water level and an increased density of fish allows for an adequate amount of food for the nestlings. This can occur anytime between November and August. After it starts, breeding takes about four months to complete.This bird lays one clutch of three to five cream coloured eggs that are about in size. These eggs are usually laid one to two days apart and incubated for 27 to 32 days by both sexes. This incubation period starts when the first egg is laid. During the first week of incubation, the parents do not go far from the colony, with the exception of the short trips to forage, drink, and collect nesting material carried out by the non-incubating bird. After the first week, the non-incubating bird spends less time in the colony, although the eggs are never left unattended. After a few hours of incubation, this bird sometimes takes a break to stretch, preen itself, rearrange nest material, or turn the eggs. The eggs hatch in the order in which they were laid, with an interval of a few days between when each egg hatches.

The chicks hatch altricial, unable to move, and weigh an average of . They are brooded for the first week after hatching, and after that when it is raining and at night. The chicks are not left alone until at least three weeks of age, with one parent foraging while the other guards the nest and chicks. When the chicks are at least three weeks old, they are large enough to stay and protect the nest. This coincides with the chicks getting more aggressive when presented with foreign objects or organisms. They fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching, and reach sexual maturity at four years of age, although they usually do not successfully fledge chicks until their fifth year of age.

The hatching success, the percentage of birds that had at least one egg that hatched in a year, of the wood stork is around 62%. This can vary widely, though, with colonies ranging from about 26% to 89% hatching success. The period when chicks are most vulnerable to death is from hatching to when they are two weeks old. Overall, about 31% of nests produce at least one fledged bird. Raccoons and caracaras, especially crested caracaras, are prominent predators of eggs and chicks. Other causes of nesting failure is the falling of nests, thus breaking the eggs inside. This can be caused by many events, the most prominent being poor nest construction and fights between adults.

=== Diet and feeding ===
During the dry season, the wood stork eats mostly fish, supplemented by insects. During the wet season, on the other hand, fish make up about half the diet, crabs make up about 30%, and insects and frogs make up the rest. The wood stork eats larger fish more often than smaller fish, even in some cases where the latter is more abundant. It is estimated that an adult wood stork needs about per day to sustain itself. For a whole family, it is estimated that about are needed per breeding season.

The wood stork usually forages in flocks when not breeding, and alone and in small groups when it is breeding. In the dry season, the stork generally forages by slowly walking forward with its bill submerged in water while groping for food. During the wet season, this method is used about 40% of the time to catch food. During this period, foot stirring, where the stork walks very slowly with its bill in the water while pumping its foot up and down before every step, is used about 35% of the time. Both these hunting methods are non-visual.

Because of its non-visual foraging methods, the wood stork requires shallow water and a high density of fish to forage successfully. The water that it forages in during the dry season averages about in depth, while during the wet season, the water usually is about deep. In the dry season, this stork prefers to forage in waters with no emergent vegetation, whereas in the wet season, it prefers areas with vegetation emerging between above the surface on average. This bird can travel over to reach foraging sites, lending it access to a wide variety of habitats.

Both parents feed the chicks by regurgitating food onto the nest floor. The chicks are mainly fed fish that are between in length, with the length of the fish typically increasing as the chicks get older. The amount of food that the chicks get changes over time, with more being fed daily from hatching to about 22 days, when food intake levels off. This continues until about 45 days, when food consumption starts to decrease. Overall, a chick eats about before it fledges.

=== Predators and parasites ===
Raccoons are predators of wood stork chicks, especially during dry periods where the water beneath nesting trees dries up. Where it occurs, the crested caracara is a significant predator of eggs. Other caracaras, and hawks and vultures, also prey on both eggs and chicks.

In the United States, &quot;Haemoproteus crumenium&quot;, a blood protozoan, can be found in subadult and adult wood storks. Other species of &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; also infect wood storks in Costa Rica, in addition to &quot;Syncuaria mycteriae&quot;, a nematode found in the gizzard of the wood stork.

=== Flight ===
When flying, this bird utilizes two different techniques. When it is not sufficiently warm and clear, such as in the late afternoon or on cloudy days, this stork alternates between flapping its wings and gliding for short periods of time. When it is warm and clear, this bird glides after it gains an altitude of at least through continuously flapping its wings. It can then glide for distances ranging from . It does not have to flap its wings during this time because the warm thermals are strong enough to support its weight. Because of the energy that is conserved by soaring, this stork usually uses this method to fly to more distant areas. It flies with its neck outstretched and its legs and feet trailing behind it.

When flying to foraging areas, the wood stork averages a speed of about . In flapping flight it does , and about by gliding.
=== Excretion and thermoregulation ===

During the breeding season, the wood stork commonly defecates over the edge of its nest, while the chicks usually defecate inside. The method of defecation of the adult differs based on temperature. Normally, it excretes by leaning forward and slightly raising its tail, with the waste either going straight down or slightly backward. When it is hot, though, the adult takes a different position, quickly moving its tail downwards and forwards while twisting its body around to aim at a leg that is bent backward (this is called urohidrosis). Which leg is aimed at is alternated. The excrement aimed at the legs is fluid and watery. It generally hits the legs around the middle of the unfeathered tibia, and runs down the leg as it is being directed by the scales. This results in evaporation, making this a method of thermoregulation. The temperature at which this starts is slightly above the threshold for panting, the latter of which takes place at temperatures of about and above, compared to the normal body temperature of about . In hot weather, breeding adults will also shade their chicks with their wings.

== Evolution ==

=== Fossil record ===
The species most likely evolved in tropical regions and its North American presence probably postdates the last ice age. A fossil fragment from the Touro Passo Formation found at Arroio Touro Passo (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) might be of the living species; it is at most from the Late Pleistocene age, a few 10,000s of years ago. North American fossils from that time are of an extinct larger relative, &quot;M. wetmorei&quot;, which would be distinguished from the wood stork on the basis of size and on the basis of &quot;M. wetmorei&quot;&#x27;s less curved mandible. This was probably a sister species; both occurred sympatrically on Cuba at the end of the Pleistocene.

=== Phylogenetics ===
Within storks (Ciconiidae), the genus &quot;Mycteria&quot;, which includes the wood stork and three other extant species, is the sister group to the clade containing the genera &quot;Ephippiorhynchus&quot;, &quot;Jabiru&quot;, and &quot;Ciconia.&quot; Based on molecular and cytogenetic data, the wood stork is the basal group, or the earliest diverging group, within the &quot;Myceria&quot; genus. 

=== Genome ===
The wood stork has 72 chromosomes (2n = 72; 35 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes) as determined by karyotype analysis. Like all birds, the wood stork has a ZW sex-determination system in which males have a pair of similar chromosomes, ZZ, and females have a pair of dissimilar chromosomes, ZW. Thus, females are the heterogametic sex while males are the homogametic sex. A highly contiguous genome assembly of the wood stork has been produced with 31 autosomal pairs and both sex chromosomes identified. Four chromosomal pairs were not identified; this is attributed to the small size of these particular chromosomes. Avian genomes tend to have approximately 10–12 pairs of large chromosomes and many smaller microchromosomes, gene-dense chromosomes with little repetitive genetic content.
== Conservation status ==
Globally, the wood stork is considered least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to its large range. In the United States, this bird is considered to be threatened. This is a recovery from its former status as endangered, which it held from 1984 to 2014 because of a decline in its population caused by habitat loss and drought. Similarly, in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, its decline seems to have been reversed: after an absence between the late 1960s and the mid-1990s, the species is now again regularly encountered there, in particular in the Tubarão River region. It is likely that the Paraná River region&#x27;s wetlands served as a stronghold of the species, from where it is now re-colonizing some of its former haunts.

=== Threats ===
Hunting and egg-collecting by humans has been implicated as a factor in the decline of South American wood storks. Humans also cause nest failures through ecotourism; disturbance by tourists can have an effect on nesting success, with a study finding that nests that had boats passing by them within about had an average of 0.1 chicks fledging, compared to the normal rate for that area of about 0.9 chicks fledging per nest. Pedestrians watching from a distance of at least did not significantly affect nesting success.

Habitat alteration has been implicated as the main threat to wood stork populations in the United States. In the Everglades, levee and drainage systems have caused the timing of water fluctuations to change, thus shifting the timing of nesting and consequently a decrease in population.

<text>The Association of Jewish Libraries (AJL) is an international organization dedicated to the production, collection, organization and dissemination of Judaic resources as a library, media, and information service. AJL has members in the United States, Canada, Israel and over 22 other countries.

It was formed through a merger of two organizations, The Jewish Librarians Association, founded in 1946, which concerned itself with collections of Judaica in academic, archival or research institutions, and The Jewish Library Association, founded in 1962, which concerned itself with collections in the synagogue, school and community, and several other smaller libraries and media centers.

The organization has various professional development opportunities, including library training webinars. and workshops, mentoring programs and continuing education opportunities. Scholarships are available to members who wish to pursue studies in Judaica and Hebraica librarianship.

== Publications ==
The Association of Jewish Libraries publishes several serials including a scholarly journal &quot;Judaica Librarianship&quot; and the electronic quarterlies &quot;AJL News&quot; and &quot;AJL Reviews&quot;. AJL also has an electronic mailing list called Hasafran, which is Hebrew for &quot;the librarian&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Judaica Librarianship&quot; became an online journal. Back issues are freely available 12 months after the publication date. The journal seeks to publish research articles and essays related to the development and management of Judaica collections in all types of libraries and archives, the initiation and coordination of digital curation projects, the creation and dissemination of information resources in all formats, and the promotion of Jewish information literacy for diverse audiences through various outreach activities.

== Awards ==
The Association of Jewish Libraries awards the Sydney Taylor Book Award annually for books that authentically portray the Jewish experience in children&#x27;s literature, the Sydney Taylor Manuscript Award for the most promising unpublished Judaic manuscript for children and the AJL Jewish Fiction Award for works of fiction for adult readers with significant Jewish thematic content.

The Association also awards the Judaica Reference and Bibliography Awards for outstanding scholarly reference works and bibliographies.

== Conferences ==
The AJL Conference, held annually, is a valuable way for Judaica librarians to share ideas, learn, and network with their peers.

===Locations of past conferences===
==American Library Association==
The Association of Jewish Libraries is an affiliate of the American Library Association.

<doc id="579967" wikidata="Q1965571" url="?curid=579967" title="Meatotomy">
<text>A meatotomy () is a form of penile modification in which the underside of the glans is split, extending the urinary meatus. The procedure may be performed by a doctor to alleviate meatal stenosis or urethral stricture. Outside of medical justification, it can be performed for aesthetic purposes and is considered to be an extreme form of genital modification.

==Procedure==

A variety of techniques may be used to make the cut, but a doctor will generally crush the ventral meatus, urethra, and upper frenulum for 60 seconds with a straight Kelly hemostat and then divide the crush line with fine-tipped scissors. Other techniques include cauterisation, cutting with a scalpel (sometimes aided by clamps), or by using existing fistulas from it to &quot;tie off&quot; the area to be cut. Most self-performed modifications tend to use a clamp and cut method. Depending on the anatomy of the individual and the extent of the split, meatotomy performed with a scalpel may involve heavy bleeding, while crush and cauterisation methods are relatively bloodless. Regardless of the procedure used, meatotomies, like other genital modifications and genital piercings, heal quickly. Unlike other genital modifications, the glans tissue does not have a tendency to re-adhere to itself or heal closed.

A meatotomy may be extended to subincision or genital bisection, which are both much more complex and serious modifications.

==Effects==
Aside from the exposure of previously internal tissues, the newly enlarged urethral opening may hinder the ability to control the direction and shape of one&#x27;s urine stream. This may result in messy urination and require that the meatotomized individual sit while urinating; however, this is not universally true. The larger urethral opening may also reduce the velocity of ejaculate, thereby reducing distance of ejaculation.

Individuals who have been meatotomized for sexual gratification report that the exposed surface area of the glans penis and access to the spongy urethra for sounding creates heightened physical pleasure.

Repair of a meatotomy can be painful and difficult, and is similar to hypospadias repair.

<doc id="579976" wikidata="Q571337" url="?curid=579976" title="Antarctic realm">
<text>The Antarctic realm is one of eight terrestrial biogeographic realms. The ecosystem includes Antarctica and several island groups in the southern Atlantic and Indian oceans. The continent of Antarctica is so cold that it has supported only 2 vascular plants for millions of years, and its flora presently consists of around 250 lichens, 100 mosses, 25–30 liverworts, and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic algal species, which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent. Antarctica&#x27;s two flowering plant species, the Antarctic hair grass (&quot;Deschampsia antarctica&quot;) and Antarctic pearlwort (&quot;Colobanthus quitensis&quot;), are found on the northern and western parts of the Antarctic Peninsula. Antarctica is also home to a diversity of animal life, including penguins, seals, and whales.

Several Antarctic and sub-Antarctic island groups are considered part of the Antarctic realm, including Bouvet Island, the Crozet Islands, Heard Island, the Kerguelen Islands, the McDonald Islands, the Prince Edward Islands, the South Georgia Group, the South Orkney Islands, the South Sandwich Islands, and the South Shetland Islands. These islands have a somewhat milder climate than Antarctica proper, and support a greater diversity of tundra plants, although they are all too windy and cold to support trees.

Antarctic krill is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, crabeater seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other birds. The ocean there is so full of phytoplankton because water rises from the depths to the light-flooded surface, bringing nutrients from all oceans back to the photic zone.

On August 20, 2014, scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living below the ice of Antarctica.

== History ==
Millions of years ago, Antarctica was warmer and wetter, and supported the Antarctic flora, including forests of podocarps and southern beech. Antarctica was also part of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwanaland, which gradually broke up by continental drift starting 110 million years ago. The separation of South America from Antarctica 30–35 million years ago allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to form, which isolated Antarctica climatically and caused it to become much colder. The Antarctic flora subsequently died out in Antarctica, but is still an important component of the flora of southern Neotropical (Latin America and the Caribbean) and Australasian realms, which were also former parts of Gondwana.

Some botanists recognize an Antarctic Floristic Kingdom that includes Antarctica, New Zealand, and parts of Temperate South America where the Antarctic Flora is still a major component.

== Ecoregions ==
The Antarctic realm is divided into 17 tundra ecoregions:

<text>John Fries (; 1750February 1818) was a Pennsylvania auctioneer. He organized Fries&#x27;s Rebellion, an early episode of tax resistance in the United States.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in Hatfield Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in about 1750. His father, Simon Fries, was a German immigrant. He trained as a cooper but eventually took a career as an auctioneer. He married Margaret Brunner in 1770, and they had ten children.

He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, commanding a company. He was in action at White Marsh, Camp Hill, and Crooked Billet. His defeat of a British foraging raid made him locally famous. He later also commanded a company in the government&#x27;s campaign to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.

===Rebellion===

At the time of the rebellion named for him (1799-1800), Fries was living near Charlestown (present-day Trumbauersville). As an itinerant auctioneer, he became well acquainted with the German-Americans issues in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania. Starting in February 1799, he organized meetings to discuss a collective response to a tax the federal government had levied in response to the Quasi-War.

Federal officers who were sent to Pennsylvania to collect its portion of the tax were resisted by a party of opposition which Fries had rallied from among the German speaking populations of Montgomery, Lehigh, Bucks and Berks counties. At Bethlehem, 7 March 1799, the United States marshal was compelled by this party to release 30 prisoners who had been arrested for refusing to obey the law. The rebellion was at length put down by the militia which U.S. President John Adams ordered out. Fries was captured and tried for treason against the United States. He was tried twice and on each occasion sentenced to death. In April 1800 he was pardoned by President Adams, who at the same time proclaimed an amnesty to all concerned in the rebellion.

=== Pardon ===
How the pardon was gained has been told with an apparent word of mouth legend:

&quot;Now John Fries was an old man. He had a wife and ten children, several of whom were small—one, tiny baby. It was thought a great pity that a man so old and with a family so sadly in need of help and support should be sent to the gallows. It was therefore agreed to draw up a petition and send it about among the inhabitants of the community to be signed, begging the President to pardon the old man. Several thousand signed their names to the petition. The paper was then given into the hand of Mrs. Fries, who, with her infant in her arms and her nine children following, went to present it to President Adams. They were invited into the room where the President sat, and before he was aware of it the sorrow-stricken mother and all her children were on their knees before him. She handed him the petition, begging him to speak the word that would spare the life of her husband.

&quot;It was a moment of great suspense. President Adams glanced hastily at the petition and then looked down upon the supplicating group. Tears sprang to his eyes. He rose and raised his hands to heaven. Then he rushed from the room and seizing a pen wrote a full and free pardon, which he presented to the weeping mother. Words could not express the poor woman’s gratitude, and the children who were old enough to understand were beside themselves with joy. The President needed no other thanks than to look into their radiant, tear-stained faces. And ever after, to the sons and daughters of John Fries, the name of the great-hearted President was a sacred household word&quot; (Fearson, Mrs. G.E. &quot;Paths of Uprightness&quot;. Waukesha, Wisconsin: Metropolitan Church Association, 1933, pages 13–14).

===Later life===
After his reprieve, Fries continued his auctioneering career. Some sources report that he became a prosperous merchant of tin ware in Philadelphia, but Thomas Denton McCormick states there is no evidence to back this story, and also says he just continued his auctioneering career. Fries died at his home, on the old Allentown Road, south of Trumbauersville in 1818. A segment of Pennsylvania Route 663 between Quakertown and Pennsburg is named in his honor.

<doc id="580003" wikidata="Q808594" url="?curid=580003" title="Baron Beaumont">
<text>Baron Beaumont is an ancient title in the Peerage of England, created in 1309 for a younger branch of the French counts of &quot;de Brienne&quot; family. The sixth Baron Beaumont was created Viscount Beaumont (the first creation of this rank in England) in 1432; after the death of his son the 2nd Viscount both titles fell into abeyance.

In 1840 the abeyance of the barony was terminated in favour of Miles Thomas Stapleton who was called to the peerage as the 8th Baron Beaumont. His paternal great-great-grandfather Nicholas Errington (d.1716), of Pont-Eland, Northumberland, had adopted the surname and arms of Stapleton having inherited the manor of Carlton from his childless uncle Miles Stapleton, 1st Baronet.

The 8th Baron was succeeded by his sons Henry and Miles, the 9th and 10th Barons respectively. The barony was briefly in abeyance again following the death of the 10th Baron and was called out in favour of his daughter, Mona, in 1896. The 11th Baroness Beaumont married Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 3rd Baron Howard of Glossop in 1914. Their eldest son Miles succeeded his mother as 12th Baron Beaumont in 1971, his father as 4th Baron Howard of Glossop in 1972 and, in 1975, his second cousin once removed Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk as 17th Duke of Norfolk. The Beaumont Barony is currently (as of 2014) held by the 18th Duke of Norfolk.

The Beaumont title descends to &quot;heirs of the body&quot;, while the Dukedom of Norfolk descends to &quot;heirs male&quot;. The titles may therefore eventually separate.

The Stapleton family&#x27;s seat was Carlton Towers (built upon their ancient manor of Carlton) which in 1971 was inherited by the 17th Duke of Norfolk from his mother Mona Stapleton, 11th Baroness Beaumont.

<text>Gilead or Gilad (, ; &quot;Gilʿāḏ&quot;, , &quot;Jalʻād&quot;) is the ancient, historic, biblical name of the mountainous northern part of the region of Transjordan. The region is bounded in the west by the Jordan River, in the north by the deep ravine of the river Yarmouk and the region of Bashan, and in the southwest by what were known during antiquity as the &quot;plains of Moab&quot;, with no definite boundary to the east. In some cases, &quot;Gilead&quot; is used in the Bible to refer to all the region east of the Jordan River. Gilead is situated in modern-day Jordan, corresponding roughly to the Irbid, Ajloun, Jerash and Balqa Governorates.

==Etymology==
Gilead is explained in the Hebrew Bible as derived from the Hebrew words , which in turn comes from (&#x27;heap, mound, hill&#x27;) and (&#x27;witness, testimony&#x27;). If that is the case, Gilead means &#x27;heap [of stones] of testimony&#x27;. There is also an alternative theory that it means &#x27;rocky region&#x27;.

From its mountainous character, it is called the Mount of Gilead (; ). It is called also the Land of Gilead (, ) in many translations, and sometimes simply Gilead (; ; ), also mentioned in .

==History==
===Hebrew Bible===
The name Gilead first appears in the biblical account of the last meeting of Jacob and Laban (). In Book of Genesis, Gilead was also referred to by the Aramaic name Yegar-Sahadutha, which carries the same meaning as the Hebrew Gilead, namely &quot;heap [of stones] of testimony&quot; ().

According to the biblical narrative, during the Exodus, &quot;half Gilead&quot; was possessed by Sihon, and the other half, separated from it by the river Jabbok, by Og, king of Bashan. After the two kings were defeated, the region of Gilead was allotted by Moses to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the eastern half of Manasseh (; ).

In the Book of Judges, the thirty sons of the biblical judge Jair controlled the thirty towns of Gilead (), and in the First Book of Chronicles, Segub controlled twenty-three towns in Gilead (). It was bounded on the north by Bashan, and on the south by Moab and Ammon (; ).

&quot;Gilead&quot; mentioned in the Book of Hosea may refer to the cities of Ramoth-Gilead, Jabesh-Gilead, or the whole Gilead region; &quot;Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is stained with blood&quot; ().

The kingdoms Ammon and Moab sometimes expanded to include southern Gilead. King David fled to Mahanaim in Gilead during the rebellion of Absalom. Gilead is later mentioned as the homeplace of the prophet Elijah.
===Neo-Assyrian province===
King Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria established the province of Gal&#x27;azu (Gilead) c. 733 BCE.

===Arabic===
Gilead (, Ǧalʻād or Jalaad) is an Arabic term used to refer to the mountainous land extending north and south of Jabbok. It was used more generally for the entire region east of the Jordan River. It corresponds today to the northwestern part of the Kingdom of Jordan. The region appears in the ancient Safaitic inscriptions.

<text>In economics, goods are anything that is good, usually in the sense that it provides welfare or utility to someone. Goods can be contrasted with bads, i.e. things that provide negative value for users, like chores or waste. A bad lowers a consumer&#x27;s overall welfare.

Economics focuses on the study of economic goods, i.e. goods that are scarce; in other words, producing the good requires expending effort or resources. Economic goods contrast with free goods such as air, for which there is an unlimited supply.

== Utility and characteristics of goods ==
The change in utility (pleasure or satisfaction) gained by consuming one unit of a good is called its marginal utility. Goods are commonly considered to have diminishing marginal utility, which means that consuming more gives less utility per amount consumed. Some things are useful, but not scarce enough to have monetary value, such as the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; these are referred to as &quot;free goods&quot;.

Final goods are items that are ultimately consumed, rather than used in the production of another good. For example, a microwave oven or a bicycle that is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, but the components that are sold to be used in those goods are intermediate goods. For example, textiles or transistors can be used to make some further goods.

Commercial goods are construed as tangible products that are manufactured and then made available for supply to be used in an industry of commerce. Commercial goods could be tractors, commercial vehicles, mobile structures, airplanes, and even roofing materials. Commercial and personal goods as categories are very broad and cover almost everything a person sees from the time they wake up in their home, on their commute to work to their arrival at the workplace.

Commodities may be used as a synonym for economic goods but often refer to marketable raw materials and primary products.

Although common goods are tangible, certain classes of goods, such as information, only take intangible forms. For example, among other goods an apple is a tangible object, while news belongs to an intangible class of goods and can be perceived only by means of an instrument such as printers or television.

== Types of goods ==

Goods&#x27; diversity allows for their classification into different categories based on distinctive characteristics, such as tangibility and (ordinal) relative elasticity. A tangible good like an apple differs from an intangible good like information due to the impossibility of a person to physically hold the latter, whereas the former occupies physical space. Intangible goods differ from services in that final (intangible) goods are transferable and can be traded, whereas a service cannot.

Price elasticity also differentiates types of goods. An elastic good is one for which there is a relatively large change in quantity due to a relatively small change in price, and therefore is likely to be part of a family of substitute goods; for example, as pen prices rise, consumers might buy more pencils instead. An inelastic good is one for which there are few or no substitutes, such as tickets to major sporting events, original works by famous artists, and prescription medicine such as insulin. Complementary goods are generally more inelastic than goods in a family of substitutes. For example, if a rise in the price of beef results in a decrease in the quantity of beef demanded, it is likely that the quantity of hamburger buns demanded will also drop, despite no change in buns&#x27; prices. This is because hamburger buns and beef (in Western culture) are complementary goods. Goods considered complements or substitutes are relative associations and should not be understood in a vacuum. The degree to which a good is a substitute or a complement depends on its relationship to other goods, rather than an intrinsic characteristic, and can be measured as cross elasticity of demand by employing statistical techniques such as covariance and correlation.

=== Bads ===
A bad is the opposite of a good, because its consumption or presence lowers the customer&#x27;s utility. With goods, a two-party transaction results in the exchange of money for some object, as when money is exchanged for a car. With a bad, however, both money and the object in question go the same direction, as when a household gives up both money and garbage to a waste collector, meaning the garbage has a negative price (as the waste collector is receiving both garbage and money, thus paying a negative amount for the garbage).

== Goods classified by exclusivity and competitiveness ==

=== Fourfold model of goods ===

Goods can be classified based on their degree of excludability and rivalry (competitiveness). Considering excludability can be measured on a continuous scale, some goods would not be able to fall into one of the four common categories used.

There are four types of goods based on the characteristics of rival in consumption and excludability: Public Goods, Private Goods, Common Resources, and Club Goods. These four types plus examples for anti-rivalry appear in the accompanying table.

==== Public goods ====

Goods that are both non-rival and non-excludable are called public goods. In many cases, renewable resources, such as land, are common commodities but some of them are contained in public goods. Public goods are non-exclusive and non-competitive, meaning that individuals cannot be stopped from using them and anyone can consume this good without hindering the ability of others to consume them. Examples in addition to the ones in the matrix are national parks, or firework displays. It is generally accepted by mainstream economists that the market mechanism will under-provide public goods, so these goods have to be produced by other means, including government provision. Public goods can also suffer from the Free-Rider problem.

==== Private goods ====

Private goods are excludable goods, which prevent other consumers from consuming them. Private goods are also rivalrous because one good in private ownership cannot be used by someone else. That is to say, consuming some goods will deprive another consumer of the ability to consume the goods. Private goods are the most common type of goods. They include what you have to get from the store. For examples food, clothing, cars, parking spaces, etc. An individual who consumes an apple denies another individual from consuming the same one. It is excludable because consumption is only offered to those willing to pay the price.

==== Common-pool resources ====

Common-pool resources are rival in consumption and non-excludable. An example is that of fisheries, which harvest fish from a shared common resource pool of fish stock. Fish caught by one group of fishermen are no longer accessible to another group, thus being rivalrous. However, oftentimes, due to an absence of well-defined property rights, it is difficult to restrict access to fishermen who may overfish.

==== Club goods ====

Club goods are excludable but not rivalrous in the consumption. That is, not everyone can use the good, but when one individual has claim to use it, they do not reduce the amount or the ability for others to consume the good. By joining a specific club or organization we can obtain club goods; As a result, some people are excluded because they are not members. Examples in addition to the ones in the matrix are cable television, golf courses, and any merchandise provided to club members. A large television service provider would already have infrastructure in place which would allow for the addition of new customers without infringing on existing customers viewing abilities. This would also mean that marginal cost would be close to zero, which satisfies the criteria for a good to be considered non-rival. However, access to cable TV services is only available to consumers willing to pay the price, demonstrating the excludability aspect.

Economists set these categories for these goods and their impact on consumers. The government is usually responsible for public goods and common goods, and enterprises are generally responsible for the production of private and club goods, although this is not always the case.

=== History of the fourfold model of goods ===

In 1977, Nobel winner Elinor Ostrom and her husband Vincent Ostrom proposed additional modifications to the existing classification of goods so to identify fundamental differences that affect the incentives facing individuals. Their definitions are presented on the matrix.

Elinor Ostrom proposed additional modifications to the classification of goods to identify fundamental differences that affect the incentives facing individuals

# Replacing the term &quot;rivalry of consumption&quot; with &quot;subtractability of use&quot;.
# Conceptualizing subtractability of use and excludability to vary from low to high rather than characterizing them as either present or absent.
# Overtly adding a very important fourth type of good—common-pool resources—that shares the attribute of subtractability with private goods and difficulty of exclusion with public goods. Forests, water systems, fisheries, and the global atmosphere are all common-pool resources of immense importance for the survival of humans on this earth.
# Changing the name of a &quot;club&quot; good to a &quot;toll&quot; good since goods that share these characteristics are provided by small scale public as well as private associations.

=== Expansion of fourfold model: anti-rivalrous ===

Consumption can be extended to include &quot;Anti-rivalrous&quot; consumption.

=== Expansion of Fourfold model: Semi-Excludable ===

The additional definition matrix shows the four common categories alongside providing some examples of fully excludable goods, Semi-excludable goods and fully non-excludeable goods. Semi-excludable goods can be considered goods or services that a mostly successful in excluding non-paying customer, but are still able to be consumed by non-paying consumers. An example of this is movies, books or video games that could be easily pirated and shared for free.

== Trading of goods ==

Goods are capable of being physically delivered to a consumer. Goods that are &quot;economic intangibles&quot; can only be stored, delivered, and consumed by means of media.

Goods, both tangibles and intangibles, may involve the transfer of product ownership to the consumer. Services do not normally involve transfer of ownership of the service itself, but may involve transfer of ownership of goods developed or marketed by a service provider in the course of the service. For example, sale of storage related goods, which could consist of storage sheds, storage containers, storage buildings as tangibles or storage supplies such as boxes, bubble wrap, tape, bags and the like which are consumables, or distributing electricity among consumers is a service provided by an electric utility company. This service can only be experienced through the consumption of electrical energy, which is available in a variety of voltages and, in this case, is the &quot;economic goods&quot; produced by the electric utility company. While the service (namely, distribution of electrical energy) is a process that remains in its entirety in the ownership of the electric service provider, the goods (namely, electric energy) is the object of ownership transfer. The consumer becomes an electric energy owner by purchase and may use it for any lawful purposes just like any other goods.

<text>UAIOE is the third studio album by the German industrial band KMFDM. It was released on 7 October 1989 by Cash Beat Records. Several 1970&#x27;s &quot;rock&quot; bands are referenced: The album&#x27;s title track borrows heavily from the lyrical tropes of Frank Zappa, whereas the song &quot;En Esch&quot; is, lyrically, a cover version of Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Demon&#x27;s Eye&quot; (which also features the opening riff from Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Saves&quot;).

==Release==
&quot;UAIOE&quot; was released in 1989 by Cash Beat Records in Germany, by Deutschland Strikeback Records in the United Kingdom and by Wax Trax! Records in the United States. A remastered reissue of &quot;UAIOE&quot; was released on 12 September 2006 with new liner notes and photos of the band.

==Reception==

&quot;UAIOE&quot; received somewhat positive reviews. Andy Hinds of AllMusic said the work sounded more complete than previous releases, and called &quot;More &amp; Faster&quot; the band&#x27;s first classic song. Robert Christgau said the album was &quot;groovier than the noise norm&quot; and said the guest vocalists &quot;add personality&quot;.

<doc id="580053" wikidata="Q373114" url="?curid=580053" title="Black-headed ibis">
<text>The black-headed ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus), also known as the Oriental white ibis, Indian white ibis, and black-necked ibis, is a species of wading bird of the ibis family Threskiornithidae which breeds in the South and Southeast Asia from India to the west and as far east as Japan. It is the only native ibis species in its range that has an overall white plumage with a black neck and head. The down-curved beak and legs are also black. Though often referred to as a wetland species, the black-headed ibis forages in a range of natural and man-made habitats. This species of ibis nests only during the rainy season.

== Description ==
The black-headed ibis is one of several large waterbird species in south and south-east Asia, with adults measuring 65–76 cm in length. The white plumage is starkly contrasted against a conspicuous naked black neck and head, and black down-curved beak. Tails of adults bear light grey ornamental feathers that turn jet black during the breeding season. During the breeding season, bare patches under the wing turn blood-red. The head of some breeding adults gain a blueish tinge, or very rarely have a pink or bright red patch behind the neck. Some breeding adults also develop tufts of white feathers behind the neck, and rarely also get a yellowish colouration on the breast and back. Sexes are identical but juveniles are identifiable from adults in having greyish feathering on the neck and speckled brown-grey feathering on the wings and back. Like storks and spoonbills, it lacks a true voice-producing mechanism and is silent except for ventriloquistic grunts uttered by pairs at the nest.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Black-headed ibis are native to the following countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. They are migratory or vagrant in Japan, Republic of Korea, Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic and Mongolia. The species is a widespread breeding bird in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Myanmar, and has declined considerably to few locations or breeding colonies in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The most rapid decline in recent times is suspected to be the population in Sumatra.

The black-headed ibis is very versatile being able to use a large variety of natural and man-made habitats. These include freshwater and salt-water marshes, lakes and ponds, as also rice fields, freshly ploughed crop fields, irrigation canals, riversides, reservoirs, urban lakes, open sewage gutters, grazing lots, and garbage dumping sites. Ibis alter use of varied preferred foraging habitats by season in agricultural landscapes such as in south-western Uttar Pradesh in India. In summer, they largely use and prefer natural marshes and fallow fields, but in the monsoon, spread out more evenly to also use a variety of agricultural fields. In landscapes that have more forests and rocky hills as in southern Rajasthan, wetlands are the preferred habitats year-round and there is little difference in habitats used in different seasons. In more urban landscapes, black-headed Ibis abundance was positively associated with crop fields, wetlands and open areas. Open sewage lines are used more during the dry summers, and ibis increase the use of grazing lands during the monsoon.

It nests in heronry colonies near wetlands. It builds a platform nest of sticks, lined with grass and threads. Old trees in cities are used for night roosting and for nesting.

The daily activity budget of Black-headed Ibis in a protected wetland showed ibises to spend the maximum time feeding (48%), followed by resting (23%).

<text>Ehud ben‑Gera (; , &quot;ʾĒhūḏ ben‑Gērāʾ&quot;) is described in the biblical Book of Judges chapter 3 as a judge who was sent by God to deliver the Israelites from Moabite domination. He is described as being left-handed and a member of the Tribe of Benjamin.

==Biblical narrative==
According to , Ehud was sent by the Israelites to the Moabite King Eglon on the pretext of delivering the Israelites&#x27; annual tribute. He made a double-edged shortsword about a cubit (eighteen inches) long, useful for a stabbing thrust. Being left-handed, he could conceal the sword on his right thigh, where it was not expected. Left handedness is significant because the left side of the body is often associated with deception or darkness, it is a tactical advantage in war against the majority who are often right-handed, and is symbolic for being outside of the culturally accepted social norm of leadership in ancient Israel. Once they met, Ehud told Eglon he had a secret message for him. Eglon dismissed his attendants and allowed Ehud to meet him in private. The Hebrew for the location of the private meeting is  בַּעֲלִיַּת הַמְּקֵרָה &quot;ba-ʿăliyat ha-məqērāh&quot;, translated as cooling roof chamber, which was likely a bathroom given that the servants believed Eglon was relieving himself (v24). Ehud said, &quot;I have a message from God for you&quot;, drew his sword, and stabbed the king in his abdomen. The Hebrew word for abdomen בְּבִטְנֽוֹ (beten), is the same word that is used for the womb of a woman. After Ehud stabbed the king, the end of Judges 3:22 reads in Hebrew וַיֵּצֵא הַֽפַּרְשְׁדֹֽנָה &quot;wa-yēṣē ha-paršədōnāh&quot; usually translated as &quot;and the dirt came out&quot;, a phrase of uncertain meaning as it is only used once in the Hebrew Bible. &quot;Dirt&quot; could be translated as feces. The translations of the room, abdomen, and dirt lend to a translation that implies sexual undertones and feminizes Eglon, demeaning him to a lower status. The sword disappeared into the wound and Ehud left it there. He locked the doors to the king&#x27;s chamber and left.

Eglon&#x27;s assistants returned when too much time had elapsed and found the doors locked. Assuming that he was relieving himself, they waited &quot;to the point of embarrassment&quot; before unlocking the door and finding their king dead.

Ehud escaped to the town of Seraiah in Ephraim. He sounded the shofar and rallied the Israelite tribes, who killed the Moabites, cutting off the fords of the Jordan River, and invaded Moab itself, killing about 10,000 Moabite soldiers.

After the death of Eglon, the narrative reports that there was peace in the land for 80 years.
== Biblical criticism ==
Coogan argues that the story of Ehud was probably a folk tale of local origin that was edited by the Deuteronomistic historians. The Deuteronomistic historians &quot;incorporated a variety of previously existing sources into their narrative of life in early Israel&quot; and the story of Ehud is one such example of a &quot;previously existing source&quot;, that has been edited to include &quot;the cyclical pattern&quot; typical of the stories of the major judges. This pattern consists of apostasy, hardship, crying out to the Lord, and rescue and it is clearly present in the tale of Ehud: apostasy and hardship occur in Judges 3.12, &quot;The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord strengthened King Eglon of Moab against Israel.&quot; The &quot;crying out to the Lord&quot; and the subsequent rescue are evident in Judges 3.15: &quot;but when the Israelites cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud son of Gera&quot;. The rather lively and glorious tale is ended with the refrain of &quot;and the land had rest 80 years&quot;, (Judges 3.30) an ending typical to Gideon and other &quot;major&quot; judge stories in the book of Judges. He was the second judge chosen by God.

Barry Webb sees Ehud as &quot;directed by the Lord, who used this most unlikely hero to bring deliverance to his undeserving but desperate people&quot;.

<doc id="580067" wikidata="Q352681" url="?curid=580067" title="Ecoinformatics">
<text>Ecoinformatics, or ecological informatics, is the science of information in ecology and environmental science. It integrates environmental and information sciences to define entities and natural processes with language common to both humans and computers. However, this is a rapidly developing area in ecology and there are alternative perspectives on what constitutes ecoinformatics.

A few definitions have been circulating, mostly centered on the creation of tools to access and analyze natural system data. However, the scope and aims of ecoinformatics are certainly broader than the development of metadata standards to be used in documenting datasets. Ecoinformatics aims to facilitate environmental research and management by developing ways to access, integrate databases of environmental information, and develop new algorithms enabling different environmental datasets to be combined to test ecological hypotheses. Ecoinformatics is related to the concept of ecosystem services.

Ecoinformatics characterize the semantics of natural system knowledge. For this reason, much of today&#x27;s ecoinformatics research relates to the branch of computer science known as knowledge representation, and active ecoinformatics projects are developing links to activities such as the Semantic Web.

Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of fields like ecoinformatics to develop the foundations for effectively managing ecological information. Examples of these initiatives are National Science Foundation Datanet projects, DataONE, Data Conservancy, and Artificial Intelligence for Environment &amp; Sustainability.

== Software Development Lifecycle ==
Central to the concept of ecoinformatics is the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), a systematic framework for writing, implementing, and maintaining software products. Typically in Ecoinformatics projects, the development pipeline includes data collection, usually from several different environmental data sources, then integrating these data sources together, and then analyzing the data. Here, each step of the SDLC is described in the context of ecoinformatics, per Michener et al. It is important to note that the plan, collect, assure, describes and preserve steps refer to the data collection entity, which can be individual researchers or large data-collection networks, while the discover, integrate, and analyze steps typically refer to the individual researcher. 

Plan: Ecoinformatics projects require data from several databases. Each database holds different data, and therefore researchers should identify what types of environmental or ecological data they will need to answer their research question. 

Collect: Data is collected in several different ways. In ecoinformatics, this is usually restricted to manually entering data into a spreadsheet, and parsing data from an existing database. The growth of relational databases has made it easier for ecologists to download relevant data and integrate datasets together

Assure: Data entries should be checked thoroughly to validate their accuracy and usability, such as to check for outliers and erroneous points. The same principle applies to data downloaded from datasets. This responsibility falls on both the ecologist downloading the data, and the entity that sets up the data collection system. 

Describe: An accurate description of the metadata of a dataset that is used in a study should include enough information to deduce the data collection and processing methodology, when the data were collected, why the data were collected, and how the data were stored. This is important for reproducibility, especially for projects that build on each other and may recycle data

Preserve: After data is collected by an institutional entity, it should be archived such that it is easily accessible. Ideally, this is in databases that are maintained and not at risk of deprecation

Discover: While there are good practices for discovering data to start a research project, this process is often marred by a lack of usable, published data, as researchers may collect data specific to their study, but may not publish this data for wider use. On the data collection end, this can be addressed by better data-sharing practices, such as by linking datasets when publishing papers or studies. On the data procurement end, this can be addressed by more precise data searching, such as using key words to find relevant datasets. 

Integrate: Synthesizing datasets together can be difficult and labor-intensive, largely due to the methodological differences in data collection. There are several approaches to this, but the best practices typically involve computational approaches, namely using R or Python, to automate the processes and prevent errors

Analyze: Data analysis can take several forms, and should be tailored to the specific ecological project. However, all data analysis methods should be well-documented, including the procedure for analysis, justification for analysis methods, and any shortcomings in a specific approach.

== Applications of Ecoinformatics Across Ecology ==

=== Ecosystem Ecology ===
Ecosystem studies, by definition, encompass interactions across the entire life sciences spectrum, from microscopic biochemical reactions to large-scale geological phenomena. As a result, big databases may not be designed specifically for any particular research question, but should be inclusive enough to support most studies. Since ecosystem-level questions require a broad perspective, data-related ecosystem projects would likely incorporate data from several databases.

A common framework for incorporating data into ecosystem-level studies is the network science model, in which data collection mechanisms and resources are treated like a large, interconnected network instead of individual entities. The network may include several data collection stations within one databases, or may span across multiple databases. Currently there are several large-scale networks, but they do not generate data on the scale to consider ecology as a big data science. 

A current challenge for ecoinformatics in ecosystem ecology is that most funding is prioritized for generating new data rather than maintaining existing data infrastructures. Integrating data across the different spatial scales can also be difficult, since each dataset may hold different types of data. 

=== Urban Ecology ===
The current push for smart cities, and sensor network integration into infrastructure, has positioned as a major source of data for ecological studies. Typical urban ecology questions address the effects of urbanization on the local ecosystem, and how to drive future development to promote urban biodiversity. 

While sensor networks in cities typically collect environmental data to optimize city processes, they may also be used for ecological initiatives, especially with respect to understanding the complex, multi-layered relationship between cities and their local ecosystem. It can also be used to better understand the current landscape of cities, and identify avenues for rewinding of cities. For example, analyzing mobility patterns can identify areas that may lend themselves well to building parks and green spaces. Bird watching data can also be used to identify the types of bird species in a local area.

=== Infectious Disease ===
Like other disciplines of ecology, emerging infectious disease and epidemiology span multiple scales, from understanding the genetics that drive disease trends to large-scale spatiotemporal analyses. As a result, infectious disease studies can incorporate everything from bioinformatics, genetic sequences, amino acid sequences, and environmental observation data. 

On the micro-scale, these data can then be used to predict infectivity/transmissibility, drug resistance, drug candidates, and mutation sites. On the macro-scale, it can be used to identify societal trends or environmental factors that lend themselves to spillover, locations of infection, and practices that cause disease transmission.

<doc id="580069" wikidata="Q202151" url="?curid=580069" title="Gay-Lussac's law">
<text>Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law usually refers to Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law of combining volumes of gases, discovered in 1808 and published in 1809. However, it sometimes refers to the proportionality of the volume of a gas to its absolute temperature at constant pressure. The latter law was published by Gay-Lussac in 1802, but in the article in which he described his work, he cited earlier unpublished work from the 1780s by Jacques Charles. Consequently, the volume-temperature proportionality is usually known as Charles&#x27;s Law.

== Law of combining volumes ==

The law of combining volumes states that when gases chemically react together, they do so in amounts by volume which bear small whole-number ratios (the volumes calculated at the same temperature and pressure).

The ratio between the volumes of the reactant gases and the gaseous products can be expressed in simple whole numbers.

For example, Gay-Lussac found that two volumes of hydrogen react with one volume of oxygen to form two volumes of gaseous water. Expressed concretely, 100 mL of hydrogen combine with 50 mL of oxygen to give 100 mL of water vapor: Hydrogen(100 mL) + Oxygen(50 mL) = Water(100 mL). Thus, the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen which combine (i.e., 100mL and 50mL) bear a simple ratio of 2:1, as also is the case for the ratio of product water vapor to reactant oxygen.

Based on Gay-Lussac&#x27;s results, Amedeo Avogadro hypothesized in 1811 that, at the same temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases (of whatever kind) contain equal numbers of molecules (Avogadro&#x27;s law). He pointed out that if this hypothesis is true, then the previously stated result
:2 volumes of hydrogen + 1 volume of oxygen = 2 volume of gaseous water
could also be expressed as
:2 molecules of hydrogen + 1 molecule of oxygen = 2 molecule of water.

The law of combining volumes of gases was announced publicly by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac on the last day of 1808, and published in 1809. Since there was no direct evidence for Avogadro&#x27;s molecular theory, very few chemists adopted Avogadro&#x27;s hypothesis as generally valid until the Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro argued convincingly for it during the First International Chemical Congress in 1860.

== Pressure-temperature law ==

In the 17th century Guillaume Amontons discovered a regular relationship between the pressure and temperature of a gas at constant volume. Some introductory physics textbooks still define the pressure-temperature relationship as Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law. Gay-Lussac primarily investigated the relationship between volume and temperature and published it in 1802, but his work did cover some comparison between pressure and temperature. Given the relative technology available to both men, Amontons could only work with air as a gas, whereas Gay-Lussac was able to experiment with multiple types of common gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen.

== Volume-temperature law ==

Regarding the volume-temperature relationship, Gay-Lussac attributed his findings to Jacques Charles because he used much of Charles&#x27;s unpublished data from 1787 – hence, the law became known as Charles&#x27;s law or the Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac.

Amontons&#x27;s, Charles&#x27;, and Boyle&#x27;s law form the combined gas law. These three gas laws in combination with Avogadro&#x27;s law can be generalized by the ideal gas law.

Gay-Lussac used the formula acquired from ΔV/V = αΔT to define the rate of expansion α for gases. For air, he found a relative expansion ΔV/V = 37.50% and obtained a value of α = 37.50%/100 °C = 1/266.66 °C which indicated that the value of absolute zero was approximately 266.66 °C below 0 °C. The value of the rate of expansion α is approximately the same for all gases and this is also sometimes referred to as Gay-Lussac&#x27;s Law. See the introduction to this article, and Charles&#x27;s Law.

<doc id="580076" wikidata="Q3126193" url="?curid=580076" title="Skyglow">
<text>Skyglow (or sky glow) is the diffuse luminance of the night sky, apart from discrete light sources such as the Moon and visible individual stars. It is a commonly noticed aspect of light pollution. While usually referring to luminance arising from artificial lighting, skyglow may also involve any scattered light seen at night, including natural ones like starlight, zodiacal light, and airglow.

In the context of light pollution, skyglow arises from the use of artificial light sources, including electrical (or rarely gas) lighting used for illumination and advertisement and from gas flares. Light propagating into the atmosphere directly from upward-directed or incompletely shielded sources, or after reflection from the ground or other surfaces, is partially scattered back toward the ground, producing a diffuse glow that is visible from great distances. Skyglow from artificial lights is most often noticed as a glowing dome of light over cities and towns, yet is pervasive throughout the developed world.

==Causes==
Light used for all purposes in the outdoor and indoor environments contributes to the artificial skyglow. In fact, both intentional and unintentional usage of light such as lampposts, fixtures, and buildings illumination contribute to the scattering of the light into the atmosphere and represent one of the most detrimental effects of light pollution at night. 

Part of this artificial light at night interacts with the air molecules and aerosols, and it is absorbed and scattered depending on the optical characteristics of the surrounding environment (see ) thus creating skyglow. Whether clouds are present, this effect is amplified by the interaction with water droplets. 

Research indicates that when viewed from nearby, about half of skyglow arises from direct upward emissions, and half from reflected, though the ratio varies depending on details of lighting fixtures and usage, and distance of the observation point from the light source. In most communities, direct upward emission averages about 10–15%. Fully shielded lighting (with no light emitted directly upward) decreases skyglow by about half when viewed nearby, but by much greater factors when viewed from a distance.

Skyglow is significantly amplified by the presence of snow, and within and near urban areas when clouds are present. In remote areas, snow brightens the sky, but clouds make the sky darker.

==Mechanism==
There are two kinds of light scattering that lead to sky glow: scattering from molecules such as N2 and O2 (called Rayleigh scattering), and that from aerosols, described by Mie theory. Rayleigh scattering is much stronger for short-wavelength (blue) light, while scattering from aerosols is less affected by wavelength. Rayleigh scattering makes the sky appear blue in the daytime; the more aerosols there are, the less blue or whiter the sky appears. In many areas, most particularly in urban areas, aerosol scattering dominates, due to the heavy aerosol loading caused by modern industrial activity, power generation, farming and transportation.

Despite the strong wavelength dependence of Rayleigh scattering, its effect on sky glow for real light sources is small. Though the shorter wavelengths suffer increased scattering, this increased scattering also gives rise to increased extinction: the effects approximately balance when the observation point is near the light source.

For human visual perception of sky glow, generally the assumed context under discussions of sky glow, sources rich in shorter wavelengths produce brighter sky glow, but for a different reason (see ).

==Measurement==
Professional astronomers and light pollution researchers use various measures of luminous or radiant intensity per unit area, such as magnitudes per square arcsecond, watts per square meter per steradian,(nano-)Lamberts, or (micro-)candela per square meter. All-sky maps of skyglow brightness are produced with professional-grade imaging cameras with CCD detectors and using stars as calibration sources. Amateur astronomers have used the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale to approximately quantify skyglow ever since it was published in &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; magazine in February 2001. The scale rates the darkness of the night sky inhibited by skyglow with nine classes and provides a detailed description of each position on the scale. Amateurs also increasingly use Sky Quality Meters (SQM) that nominally measure in astronomical photometric units of visual (Johnson V) magnitudes per square arcsecond.

==Dependence on distance from source==
Sky glow brightness arising from artificial light sources falls steeply with distance from the light source, due to the geometric effects characterized by an inverse square law in combination with atmospheric absorption. An approximate relation is given by

which is known as &quot;Walker&#x27;s Law.&quot;

Walker&#x27;s Law has been verified by observation to describe both the measurements of sky brightness at any given point or direction in the sky caused by a light source (such as a city), as well as to integrated measures such as the brightness of the &quot;light dome&quot; over a city, or the integrated brightness of the entire night sky. At very large distances (over about 50 km) the brightness falls more rapidly, largely due to extinction and geometric effects caused by the curvature of the Earth.

==Dependence on light source==

Different light sources produce differing amounts of visual sky glow. The dominant effect arises from the Purkinje shift, and not as commonly claimed from Rayleigh scattering of short wavelengths (see ). When observing the night sky, even from moderately light polluted areas, the eye becomes nearly or completely dark-adapted or scotopic. The scotopic eye is much more sensitive to blue and green light, and much less sensitive to yellow and red light, than the light-adapted or photopic eye. Predominantly because of this effect, white light sources such as metal halide, fluorescent, or white LED can produce as much as 3.3 times the visual sky glow brightness of the currently most-common high-pressure sodium lamp, and up to eight times the brightness of low-pressure sodium or amber Aluminium gallium indium phosphide LED.


In detail, the effects are complex, depending both on the distance from the source as well as the viewing direction in the night sky. But the basic results of recent research are unambiguous: assuming equal luminous flux (that is, equal amounts of visible light), and matched optical characteristics of the fixtures (particularly the amount of light allowed to radiate directly upward), white sources rich in shorter (blue and green) wavelengths produce dramatically greater sky glow than sources with little blue and green. The effect of Rayleigh scattering on skyglow impacts of differing light source spectra is small.

Much discussion in the lighting industry and even by some dark-sky advocacy organizations (e.g. International Dark-Sky Association) of the sky glow consequences of replacing the currently prevalent high-pressure sodium roadway lighting systems with white LEDs neglects critical issues of human visual spectral sensitivity, or focuses exclusively on white LED light sources, or focuses concerns narrowly on the blue portion (&lt;500 nm) of the spectrum. All of these deficiencies lead to the incorrect conclusion that increases in sky glow brightness arising from the change in light source spectrum are minimal, or that light-pollution regulations that limit the CCT of white LEDs to so-called &quot;warm white&quot; (i.e. CCT &lt;4000K or 3500K) will prevent sky glow increases. Improved efficiency (efficiency in distributing light onto the target area – such as the roadway – with diminished &quot;waste&quot; falling outside of the target area and more uniform distribution patterns) can allow designers to lower lighting amounts. But efficiency improvement sufficient to overcome sky glow doubling or tripling arising from a switch to even warm-white LED from high-pressure sodium (or a 4–8x increase compared to low-pressure sodium) has not been demonstrated.

==Negative effects==
Skyglow, and more generally light pollution, has various negative effects: from aesthetic diminishment of the beauty of a star-filled sky, through energy and resources wasted in the production of excessive or uncontrolled lighting, to impacts on birds and other biological systems, including humans. Skyglow is a prime problem for astronomers, because it reduces contrast in the night sky to the extent where it may become impossible to see all but the brightest stars.

Many nocturnal organisms are believed to navigate using the polarization signal of scattered moonlight. Because skyglow is mostly unpolarized, it can swamp the weaker signal from the moon, making this type of navigation impossible. Close to global coastal megacities (e.g. Tokyo, Shanghai), the natural illumination cycles provided by the moon in the marine environment are considerably disrupted by light pollution, with only nights around the full moon providing greater radiances, and over a given month lunar dosages may be a factor of 6 less than light pollution dosage.

Due to skyglow, people who live in or near urban areas see thousands fewer stars than in an unpolluted sky, and commonly cannot see the Milky Way. Fainter sights like the zodiacal light and Andromeda Galaxy are nearly impossible to discern even with telescopes.

==Effects on the ecosystem==
The effects of sky glow in relation to the ecosystem have been observed to be detrimental to a variety of organisms. The lives of plants and animals (especially those which are nocturnal) are affected as their natural environment becomes subjected to unnatural change. It can be assumed that the rate of human development technology exceeds the rate of non-human natural adaptability to their environment, therefore, organisms such as plants and animals are unable to keep up and can suffer as a consequence.

Although sky glow can be the result of a natural occurrence, the presence of artificial sky glow has become a detrimental problem as urbanization continues to flourish. The effects of urbanization, commercialization, and consumerism are the result of human development; these developments in turn have ecological consequences. For example, lighted fishing fleets, offshore oil platforms, and cruise ships all bring the disruption of artificial night lighting to the world&#x27;s oceans.

As a whole, these effects derive from changes in orientation, disorientation, or misorientation, and attraction or repulsion from the altered light environment, which in turn may affect foraging, predator-prey dynamics, reproduction, migration, and communication. These changes can result in the death of some species such as certain migratory birds, sea creatures, and nocturnal predators.

Besides the effect on animals, crops and trees are also susceptible to destruction. The constant exposure to light has an impact of the photosynthesis of a plant, as a plant needs a balance of both sun and darkness in order for it to survive. In turn, the effects of sky glow can affect production rates of agriculture, especially in farming areas that are close to large city centers.

<text>The Malay College Kuala Kangsar (abbreviated MCKK; ; ) is a residential school in Malaysia. It is an all-boys and all-Malay school in the royal town of Kuala Kangsar, Perak. It is sometimes dubbed &quot;the Eton College of the East&quot;.

The Malay College Kuala Kangsar was awarded the Cluster School of Excellence title by the Ministry of Education (Malaysia). Since 2010, the school was awarded the Sekolah Berprestasi Tinggi or High Performance School title, a title awarded to Malaysian top schools. The school has been selected as an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School for Diploma Programme since 2011 and Middle Years Programme since 2016. The Malay College Kuala Kangsar offers the national curriculum (SPM) while implementing IB curriculum standards. MCKK is also a member of an international organisation of best secondary schools in the world called Global Alliance of Leading-Edge Schools led by Raffles Institution of Singapore. About 10% of current students are with public &amp; private scholarships, such as Bank Negara Malaysia, Telekom Malaysia, Yayasan Peneraju Pendidikan Bumiputera and many more.

The school is one of only two boarding schools in Malaysia (the other is Sekolah Alam Shah, under the patronage of Sultan of Selangor) that are under royal patronage. The school&#x27;s patron is the Conference of Rulers. As an institution under the royal patronage of Conference of Rulers, the school receives royal visits from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, King of Malaysia every five years and every year from the Sultan of Perak as school&#x27;s board chairman. The board members are also appointed by the Conference.

The school specialises in rugby, basketball, hockey, debate, robotics and most prominently, leadership.

==History==
The Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK) is the first fully residential school in Malaysia. Established on 2 January 1905, it was originally known as the Malay Residential School of Kuala Kangsar, also then formerly known as &quot;Maktab Melayu Kuala Kangsar&quot; in Malay.

The school was the brainchild of R J Wilkinson, inspector of schools for the Federated Malay States. In a letter to the resident-general dated 24 February 1904 he wrote about &quot;establishing at a suitable locality in the F.M.S., a special residential school for the education of Malays of good family and for the training of Malay boys for admission to certain branches of Government service&quot;.

William Hargreaves, headmaster of Penang Free School, was appointed as the first headmaster to lead the establishment of the school with 40 pioneering students. Since 1965, the Malay College has been led by Malay headmasters.

As it was founded to educate the Malay elite, being royal children and the sons of Malay nobility of Federation of Malaya, Brunei and Sarawak, few of its early students were from commoner families. However, during Tun Abdul Razak Hussein&#x27;s tenure as Minister of Education in 1947, as a result of rising Malay nationalism, he democratised the intake. This is mainly because of his experience as an alumnus there, where he found out the aristocrats that gained admittance to this college were mainly below par compared to their less-privileged peers in Victoria Institution and Raffles Institution. Their status as aristocrats had caused them not to be independent and to have no willingness to strive for a better future. Today, only selected Malay boys aged 13 to 17 from around Malaysia are educated there.

Some of the well known teachers include Pendeta Za&#x27;Ba and Anthony Burgess.

The &quot;Straits Echo&quot; on 15 April 1905 reported that a few boys were placed in cozy dormitories in Hargreaves’ rented house, while the others were stabled in small houses formerly occupied by the Malayan Railway clerks. The second half of the school, conducted by Mr. Vanrenen was held in a fowl house. There were 40 boys in the first intake.

The sanction for the building of a permanent school became official on 23 December 1905; by 1 May 1909, the Big School was first brought into use. On Saturday, 11 December 1909, the Big School was officially opened by the Sultan of Perak, and the auspicious date also marked the change in the name of the school from the Malay Residential School of Kuala Kangsar to the Malay College Kuala Kangsar.

The change seems to have seen greater emphasis on the original aim of MCKK. A report from 1910 said: &quot;From this school the Government have great hopes that the sons of Malays of the Raja and higher class will be educated and trained on the lines of an English Public School and be fitted to take a share in the Government of their Country.&quot;

Since its inception, more than 5,000 boys (and 2 girls) have entered the gates of MCKK. The first The Malay College Magazine was published in 1939. The compulsory white uniforms were introduced in 1949, before that, the students wore Malay dress. The MCKK &quot;samping&quot; designed and woven in Terengganu consisting of black, yellow and red (with resultant overlapping colours) was introduced in 1939 to be worn with white &quot;Baju Melayu&quot; and black &quot;songkok&quot; was made the optional Malay uniform. It was only made compulsory in 1959 by the last British Headmaster, NJ Ryan.

The Headmaster changed the names of the 3 Houses (Rookies, Heads and Wheelies) to the four names of FMS Rulers in 1905. He was the same Headmaster who personally raised the UMNO flag on Federation Day, 01/02/1948, when the MCKK boys assembled to celebrate the demise of the Malayan Union and to sing the &quot;new Malay National Anthem&quot; as described by Hashim Sam Latiff. MCKK adopted (and perhaps adapt) that tune to be the MCKK Anthem using the words in the &quot;Ode to the MCKK&quot; penned by teacher-cum-poet/writer/composer Anthony Burgess. His words, turned into lyrics for the anthem, manifests the meaning of &quot;Fiat Sapientia Virtus&quot;.

In October 1989, the Queen, Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited the school.

In 2004, the college was placed under purview of the rulers with then Crown Prince of Perak, Raja Dr Nazrin Shah appointed as board chairman.

The college celebrated its centenary on 26 March 2005, attended by dignitaries, old boys, and townspeople. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia attended the event, along with the royal rulers of the states of Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan as well as the governor of Malacca. The college were also proclaimed as the Heritage Institution of Culture and Country.

On 10 June 2006, Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan visited the school. The monarchs had promised to visit the school in the 1990s.

Since 30 May 2007, the Malaysian Ministry of Education has recognised MCKK as a cluster school.

In 2010, the school have been selected to be among the first High Performance Schools while in 2013, the Prep School celebrated its centenary.

MCKK has also hosted two international events, which are The Malay College Youth Development Summit since 2008 until now, and The Malay College Rugby Premier Sevens since 2011. Both events consist of international schools across the globe such as Southeast Asian countries like Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand getting together with premier schools from India, South Korea, South Africa and Australia.

==Buildings==

The most recognisable feature of the school is the Big School (built in 1909), a building with pseudo Greco-Roman architecture fronted by a rugby field. The school is built to accommodate 100 students initially, but in 1910, there were 139 boys in the School Register, 124 of them boarders. Thus, the planning for the construction of the Preparatory School was considered and it was referred to as the &quot;Sekolah Kechil&quot;. The block was completed by 1913 when it took in its first boarders. It was then referred to as the Prep School. It admitted boys who had completed Standard 4 and were being &quot;prepared&quot; for secondary school boarding experience by completing their Standard 5 and Form Remove at the Prep School. In 1955, the West and East Wing, as well as the administration block and Clock Tower were added. The administrative block (New School) was opened by High Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya, Donald MacGillivray, in 1955. The West and the East Wing, with the original Big School, make up what is now called the Big School. Dorms 1-6 are located in the East Wing, 7-16 in the Overfloor and 17-22 in the West Wing. Two more hostel blocks, the Pavilion and New Hostel were built in 1963 and 1972 respectively; the latter houses second formers. Another prominent feature of the school is the Big Tree, a rain tree (&quot;Samanea saman&quot;) in front of the East Wing that is said to be as old as the original Big School itself.

==Sports==
The college ground is the only place in Asia where an Eton Fives court is found. The court is located on the south side of the Big School, nearby the IB World School campus. With the introduction of squash in 1938, Eton Fives began to lose popularity at the school until it was not played at all. Since a trip in August 2014 by two top English players the game&#x27;s popularity has grown and more students are now playing again. Since then, the students have competed in The Schools National Championships, United Kingdom at Highgate School, Eton College and Shrewsbury School.

The school is currently the best rugby school team in the nation. Nicknamed &quot;MCKK All Blacks&quot; after the New Zealand national team for its all black strip, they even perform the haka before matches. Traditionally, it has held match series against the Vajiravudh College of Thailand since 1960. In odd-numbered years, the match is held in Kuala Kangsar. In even-numbered years, it is held in Bangkok. In addition to this, MCKK competes with its prominent rivals every year in a multi-games carnival.

The school basketball team is called &quot;MCKK Cagers&quot; and won Piala Hamdan Tahir, the boarding-schools basketball championship, 19 times since 1977, the most in Malaysian history. MCKK debate teams have won Piala Perdana Menteri, the boarding-schools national debate, six times for Malay category and four times for English category.

===Rivalries===
MCKK has over the years established academic and sports rivalries with several premier schools, for example, Royal Military College, Victoria Institution, both in the capital Kuala Lumpur, King Edward VII School of Taiping, Sekolah Alam Shah in Putrajaya, and its neighbour, Clifford Secondary School. Notably, the most prominent rival is Sekolah Tuanku Abdul Rahman in Ipoh, which is one of the oldest Malay boarding school in Perak along with the MCKK.

== Coat of arms ==
The shield is divided per cross, from dexter: white (&quot;argent&quot;) in the first quarter, red (&quot;gules&quot;) in the second, black (&quot;sable&quot;) in the third and yellow (&quot;or&quot;) in the fourth. Blazon: &quot;Per cross Argent, Gules, Sable and Or, overall charged with Malay dagger Gules with hilt Or.&quot; &quot;In crest: A Malayan tiger caboshed Or. Motto: Or, Fiat Sapientia Virtus in Sable.&quot;

The colours represent the four houses into which the students are grouped: Idris (white), Sulaiman (red), Mohd Shah (yellow) and Ahmad (black).

In the middle of the shield is a red kris, a traditional Malay dagger. On top of the crest is a head of a tiger which is the symbol of the Federation of Malaya. Surrounding the left and right side of the shield are laurel wreaths symbolising excellence. The school motto is &quot;Fiat Sapientia Virtus&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;Manliness Through Wisdom&quot;.

==Tuesday Activities==
Unlike other schools in Malaysia, co-curricular activities at the College are usually conducted every Tuesday. There are two types of co-curricular activities which are Club &amp; Societies and Uniformed Bodies. The students wear their uniformed body attire on this day. The uniformed bodies that are present in the school are The Malay College Marching Band, Army Cadet Corps, Red Crescent Society, Scout Troops, Fire Brigade Cadet and Malaysia Youth Cadet Corps. Club &amp; Societies at the college come and go depending on the interests of the teachers and boys at the college at the time, but some have been around for a long period. Some of the Clubs &amp; Societies that are currently in existence include: Debate, History, French Language, English Language, Malay Language, Innovation, Robotics, and more.

==Notable alumni and MCOBA==

The alumni association of MCKK is known as the Malay College Old Boys&#x27; Association (MCOBA) and it was established in 1929. In 2009, the association enrolled its first non-Malay member, Liew Yong Choon. The alumni association is based in a dilapidated building called &quot;Penthouse&quot; of the MCOBA building on Jalan Syed Putra, Kuala Lumpur.

To this date, seven Yang di-Pertuan Agong out of seventeen that have ascended the throne were its alumni (including a Lord President of the Supreme Court) and a Sultan of Brunei. Out of the four states that have Yang di-Pertua Negeri, two states have had at least one alumnus reside in office. The father of Malay nationalism and the founder of Malaysia&#x27;s largest party is also an alumnus. Two Prime Ministers and a Deputy Prime Minister (who later on became Leader of the Opposition and subsequently Prime Minister) received their education in the college. The college also has produced two Speakers of the Dewan Rakyat. The college&#x27;s Old Boys also showed their presence in economy, education, law, armed forces and art.

The novelist and composer Anthony Burgess (1917–93), author of &quot;The Long Day Wanes: A Malayan Trilogy&quot;, was a master at MCKK. He taught English and history and was housemaster at King&#x27;s Pavilion, between 1956 and 1957, during the headmastership of J.D.R. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Howell. According to Burgess&#x27; &quot;This Man &amp; Music&quot;, he wrote some music there under the influence of the country, notably Sinfoni Melayu for orchestra and brass band, which included cries of Merdeka (independence) from the audience. No score of any, however, has been delivered to posterity. The &quot;Ode: Celebration for a Malay College&quot;, Burgess had written for the college&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1955, &quot;was swiftly expunged from the school&#x27;s choral repertoire&quot;, when &quot;within months ... he had to leave the school after falling out with the headmaster, JD Howell. The following year Burgess published his first novel, &quot;Time for a Tiger&quot;. A thinly veiled account of his time at Kuala Kangsar, it so cruelly caricatured Howell and his colleagues that, as Burgess recalled in his autobiography, some of those who deemed themselves traduced &#x27;sought advice about libel&#x27; from a local lawyer. The verses of the Ode have survived but not Burgess&#x27; original melody.

The college alumni were also noted as being influential in bringing the punk music into Malaysia.

<text>Ari Meyers (born April 6, 1969) is an American former actress. She played the role of Emma Jane McArdle in the television series &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; (1984).

==Early years==
Meyers was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Jewish American parents who were touring in the island. Her mother is actress Taro Meyer, who appeared in the television soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. Shortly afterward, Meyer and her family returned to New York City where she was raised and where she received her primary and secondary education.

==Career==
In 1982, Meyers landed her first major role as the stepdaughter of Al Pacino in the movie &quot;Author! Author!&quot;. The following year, she also landed the role of Emma Jane McArdle on the TV series &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;. Meanwhile, she also continued to take advanced courses in school.

In 1988, Meyers left &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; and used her earnings to finish her studies at Yale University; from there she graduated with honors and a double major in Philosophy and Theatre Arts.

After graduating, Meyers continued acting and was mostly cast as characters much younger than her actual age. Meyers has also voiced numerous audio books, such as:

* &quot;The Amy Fisher Story&quot; (1993)
* &quot;A Kitten&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1995)
* &quot;The Wish&quot; (2000)

In 2003, Meyers appeared in the musical play &quot;Theophilus North&quot; (adopted from the 1973 novel) in New York City and in 2004 she participated in the play &quot;Little Willy&quot; after which she retired from acting. As of 2021, she is working as a postpartum nurse and lactation consultant at a hospital in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="580096" wikidata="Q452666" url="?curid=580096" title="Frenum piercing">
<text>A frenum piercing is a type of body piercing located on the underside of the shaft of the penis. A series of parallel frenum piercings is known as a frenum ladder. A frenum ladder may be extended to include lorum piercings, hafada piercings and guiche piercings.

==Placement==
It is almost always pierced through the frenum that connects the head of the penis to the shaft. The frenulum is often missing in circumcised males. 

==Healing==

Frenum piercings generally require from two to five weeks to heal fully. Depending on the placement it may be a surface piercing, but due to both the vascular, fast healing nature of the penis, and loose nature of the skin in that area, frenum piercings rarely reject if pierced properly, although they may migrate.

Those wishing to stretch this piercing to accommodate larger gauge jewelry should wait until at least two weeks after the initial piercing has fully healed. It is common for a frenum piercing to start to close soon after the jewelry has been removed. A fairly recent piercing may start to close in less than an hour. Temporary removal and replacement (for example, to accommodate a partner who finds it uncomfortable) may mean reinserting with a smaller gauge and then restretching to get back to the original, larger gauge. This tendency for the piercing to close up will diminish over time.

==Jewelry==
Both barbells and rings can be worn in frenum piercings, both as initial jewellery and on an ongoing basis. Sometimes, when rings are worn, the diameter of the ring is specifically chosen so that the ring can be worn encircling the penis. A wide variety of chastity devices make use of frenum piercings to secure themselves to the penis, as part of fetish or BDSM activities.

==History and culture==
The earliest literary reference to frenum piercings occurs in 1884 in &quot;Zeitschrift für Ethnologie&quot; which states: &quot;Amongst the Timorese of Indonesia, the Frenulum beneath the glans penis is pierced with brass rings...the function of the ring is to enhance stimulation during sex.&quot; Anecdotal piercing lore associates this piercing (along with many other male genital piercings) with various chastity devices that have been used throughout history, although there is little hard data to back up this claim.

In contemporary society, frenum piercings were primarily found amongst the members of gay BDSM subcultures, until body piercing became re-introduced to mainstream society in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Frenum piercings are often intended to provide sexual pleasure to both the bearer and the person they are having sexual intercourse with. They may also be used to attach chastity devices to the bearer, denying them sexual pleasure.

==Frenum ladder==

A frenum ladder, also known as a Jacob&#x27;s ladder, consists of a series of frenum piercings often extending from below the head of the penis and as far as the base of the shaft of the penis.

Sometimes, a frenum ladder will be accompanied by a hafada ladder and/or a guiche ladder. Due to the relatively easy healing of these piercings it is not uncommon for several, or even all of them to be performed at the same time.

Less common is a lorum ladder which consists of a series of lorum piercings.

<text>Joseph Oswald Mauborgne (February 26, 1881 – June 7, 1971) co-invented the one-time pad with Gilbert Vernam of Bell Labs. In 1914 he published the first recorded solution of the Playfair cipher. Mauborgne became a Major General in the United States Army, and from October 1937 to his retirement in 1941 was the Army&#x27;s 12th Chief Signal Officer, in command of the Signal Corps.

==Biography==
Mauborgne was born on February 26, 1881, in New York City
to Eugene and Catherine Elizabeth McLaughlin Mauborgne. After graduating in 1901 from the College of Saint Xavier in New York, he studied fine arts until commissioned a 2d Lieutenant, Infantry, in the regular Army in 1903. Stationed in the Philippines several times at several infantry posts, Mauborgne attended the Army Signal School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1909–1910, graduating from the Signal Officers Course, followed by a tour of duty in Washington, D.C., in the office of Chief Signal Officer Brigadier General George P. Scriven.

While stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, in 1912, he installed a radio transmitter in an airplane and had 1st Lt. Henry H. Arnold send him the first successful air to ground radio transmission on November 2. Two years later, while in command of the radio station at Fort Mills on Corregidor, Mauborgne went up himself with 2nd Lt. Herbert A. &quot;Bert&quot; Dargue in a Burgess Model I seaplane to conduct a series of experimental flight tests of an airborne radio, and made the first two-way radio telegraphy between an airplane and a station on the ground on December 16, 1914. After World War I, in the 1920s and 1930s, Mauborgne pursued communication advancements in numerous research-and-development assignments, including a stint as chief of the Signal Corps Engineering and Research Division and as commander of the Signal Corps laboratory in the Bureau of Standards. During the early 1930s, Mauborgne was Signal Officer for the 9th Corps Area and later Director of the Signal Corps Aircraft Factory, Wright Field, Ohio. He attended the Army War College during its 1931–32 academic session. In 1937, as a Signal Corps officer, he used a Dictaphone to record Japanese radio signals at the Presidio of San Francisco.

As Chief of Signal, Mauborgne supported technological development and oversaw the mass production of the SCR-268 and SCR-270 Army radars. Just a few months after he retired (September 30, 1941), two Signal Corps soldiers — using an SCR-270 radar at Oahu, Hawaii, in the early morning of December 7, 1941 — spotted Japanese aircraft on their way in to attack Pearl Harbor.

In addition to his professional study, Mauborgne attended the Chicago Art Institute in 1922–1923. Returning to Washington D.C. in 1923 he continued his art studies at the Corcoran Art Gallery between 1923 and 26. Portraits and etchings produced by Mauborgne were exhibited in galleries in Washington, San Francisco, and Dayton, Ohio; acquired by the United States Military Academy, and sold to private collections.

Mauborgne reached the mandatory retirement age in October 1941 and retired near Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Among his interests were music and violin-making, for which he won an international competition in The Hague in 1949. During his early career, Mauborgne was a recognized marksman, on the &quot;Distinguished Shooters&quot; list of the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

In December 1907, Mauborgne married Katherine Hale Poore, the daughter of Major General Benjamin A. Poore. They were the parents of two sons, one of whom was also a career Army officer. Mauborgne moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in ill health in 1970 and died on June 7, 1971. He was buried at Andersonville National Cemetery.

General Mauborgne is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame. General Mauborgne is also known as &quot;The Cubic General&quot;.

<text>Sir Albert James Smith (March 12, 1822 – June 30, 1883) was a New Brunswick politician and opponent of Canadian confederation. Smith&#x27;s grandfather was a United Empire Loyalist who left Massachusetts to settle in New Brunswick after the American Revolution.

Smith entered politics in 1852 entering the House of Assembly as an opponent of the Tory compact that ran the colony and became a leading reform and advocate of responsible government which was granted to the colony in 1854. Smith became a member of the reform government that took power that year and went on to become Attorney-General in 1861 under Premier Samuel Leonard Tilley. Smith split with Tilley over railway policy and Canadian confederation with Smith becoming leader of the Anti-Confederates winning the 1865 election but was forced from office the next year by the lieutenant-governor.
He was created a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1862.

Smith reconciled with Confederation after it became a fact and became minister of fisheries in the Liberal government of Alexander Mackenzie in 1873. He died in 1883, and was interred in Dorchester Rural Cemetery.

<doc id="580129" wikidata="Q1268632" url="?curid=580129" title="Dydoe">
<text>A dydoe is a type of male genital piercing that passes through the ridge of the glans on the head of the penis. They are often done in pairs. Less often, a &quot;king&#x27;s crown&quot; is where several dydoes are placed around the head of the penis. The jewelry is usually a 12 gauge, straight barbell with a ball on either end, although a ring may be used at a higher chance of rejection. A deep dydoe (also known as &quot;Zephyr&quot;) is one that uses a longer barbell and exits near the tip of the penis.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;dydoe&quot; is thought to come from the word &#x27;doodad&#x27;, which means &#x27;a decorative embellishment&#x27;, as it can be visually attractive to some.

==Procedure==
The way the ridge is formed usually dictates that the piercing be performed freehand. Healing time is around 4–6 months and abstinence is advised for the first two weeks. The piercing should be cleaned daily with a sterile saline solution [neilmed] and a condom is recommended during penile intercourse until it fully heals. The jewelry can be changed after a period of time, but it is not recommended to have it out for very long, as even when healed, the hole tends to quickly close and the pain in replacing it can be more than the actual piercing. The glans of the penis is a very vascular area and healing can be very quick, in a matter of hours. If it hasn&#x27;t fully healed back and there is difficulty replacing it, a professional piercer may be able to use a taper (a blunt, rounded needle) to re-open the hole. If it is permanently removed it will probably leave a small scar.

The dydoe is generally considered to be one of the most painful of piercings, as it goes through the glans of the penis. Bleeding is normal and very likely. Because the ridge of the glans must be large enough to accommodate the needle and jewelry it is a piercing that depends on the anatomy of the individual and should be done by a professional piercer. It is usually performed on circumcised males, as the presence of a tight foreskin keeps the area moist and inhibits healing.

==Effects==

Speculation has been made that it enhances sexual feeling that has been lost due to circumcision. The reason for this is the added pressure of the jewelry on the glans during intercourse, which may also lead to quicker ejaculations in some sex positions. During vaginal intercourse, the piercing usually results in greater stimulation for the partner. A centrally placed dydoe works especially well in stimulating the G-spot, as the ball at the head is placed near to where the top ball of an apadravya would be placed. An apadravya is generally considered the most pleasurable piercing for partners during vaginal intercourse.

<doc id="580135" wikidata="Q314721" url="?curid=580135" title="San Isidro, Davao Oriental">
<text>San Isidro, officially the Municipality of San Isidro (; ), is a municipality in the province of Davao Oriental, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 33,664 people.

San Isidro is one of the &quot;gulf towns&quot; of Davao Oriental whose shorelines stretch along Davao Gulf. Other gulf towns are Banaybanay, Lupon and Governor Generoso.

==History==
The town of San Isidro was created by virtue of Republic Act No. 4744 enacted by the Philippine Congress on June 18, 1966. It started operating as a local government unit in January 1968. Its founder and the first mayor was Vicente Yu, Sr.

==Geography==
===Climate===
===Barangays===
San Isidro is politically subdivided into 16 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.

Seven barangays are along the coastlines while the other nine are in the interior areas.
==Demographics==

Around 30% of the population belong to the indigenous Mandaya and Kalagan communities.

==Economy==

San Isidro is largely planted with coconut, with much of its agricultural industry focuses on the production of copra. There are currently efforts to further diversify the output of the municipality&#x27;s coconut-based industry from copra to other value-added coconut products such as coco-oil (which can be used as a fuel additive) and coco-coir. In 1992, a Crop Diversification Program of the local government unit (LGU) was implemented with mango as &quot;export winner&quot;. In 1998, the town commenced its first Mango Festival as an indicator of the prominence of this high yielding fruit. Farmers are also engaged in growing the popular banana (cardava). Despite this, farmers still experience difficulties in increasing their income due to lack of agricultural technology specially those farming in the upland areas.

The aggressive anti-illegal fishing efforts of the LGU decreased dynamite fishing and able to establish fish sanctuaries in San Isidro waters. Most of the fishermen in this town used paddle-boat than motorized boat in fishing.
==Tourism==
The municipality&#x27;s seascape offers potential marine-based recreational industries on the as yet virtually undisturbed Tinaytay and Burias reefs a few kilometers offshore. In addition, its scenic nature spots include beaches untouched by urban development; the cascading Cawa-cawa Stepped Falls, and the 12 km2 Pygmy or Bonsai forests in the thickly forested highlands of the municipality.

Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary

One of the tourist spots easily accessible from San Isidro is the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as it currently serves as the habitat of different endangered species of flora and fauna. What makes it an even more critical habitat for these plants and animals is that eight of those threatened species are only found at Mount Hamiguitan. Endangered species in the site include the Philippine eagle and Philippine cockatoo.

In 2017, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House, Part 2&quot;.

==Early life==
Cooper was born on July 9, 1951, in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Charles and Mary Ann (Walton) Cooper. He has an older brother, Chuck Cooper (born 1948). His father was both a United States Air Force doctor and a cattleman, and his mother was a housewife. Both of his parents were from Texas. Cooper grew up in the suburbs of Kansas City, and spent his summers at his family&#x27;s cattle ranch, located about 15 miles west of Leavenworth, Kansas. As his father was in the Air Force, he and his family moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, Phoenix, Arizona, and Houston, Texas. While attending Southwest High School in Kansas City, Cooper worked for a local theater company: &quot;I had a background in carpentry, so I could build sets and work in the wings and shift scenes in the evening.&quot; After he graduated from high school, Cooper became the shop foreman for another repertory company. He also considered helping his father raise cattle for a living. Cooper served in the Coast Guard Reserve.

Cooper attended the University of Missouri and enrolled in the theater program, originally majoring in set design. It was during his sophomore year when Cooper changed his major to acting to overcome his &quot;overpowering shyness.&quot; Cooper took acting classes at the University of Missouri. He recalled in a 1996 interview with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, &quot;I started going in and watching some shows at the theater department. I started taking theater classes and auditioned for plays. And once I got into it, it was pretty immediate. I really felt right, felt at home.&quot; Cooper also took dance classes at Stephens College.

After he graduated from the University of Missouri, Cooper moved to New York City in 1976. While living in New York, Cooper shared a one-bedroom railroad flat with four other aspiring actors and dancers. He supported himself by renovating apartments. In addition, he worked in construction and served as a janitor and a chauffeur. At the same time, he studied with Stella Adler and Wynn Handman. Prior to his film debut with &quot;Matewan&quot; (1987), Cooper spent the previous 12 years doing stage work with the Actors Theater of Louisville and the Seattle Repertory. In 1985, Cooper appeared in the London revival of &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;.

==Career==
Cooper&#x27;s early performances include John Sayles&#x27; 1987 film &quot;Matewan&quot;; the 1989 CBS-TV Western miniseries &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;; the 1991 indie Western drama &quot;Thousand Pieces of Gold&quot;, and the 1992 ABC-TV docudrama &quot;Bed of Lies&quot;, opposite Susan Dey.

Some of his more notable later performances include: &quot;Money Train&quot;, as a psychotic pyromaniac who terrifies toll booth operators; &quot;Lone Star&quot;, in a leading role as a Texas sheriff charged with solving a decades-old case; as Deputy Dwayne Looney in director Joel Schumacher&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (based on the John Grisham novel); as Frank Booker in 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;; and as a closeted homophobic Marine Corps colonel in &quot;American Beauty&quot;, a role that garnered him a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. To get into character, Cooper said he &quot;depended on a friend who&#x27;d fought in Vietnam. I asked him to go deep. What would this man have done? What would be on his walls? On his desk?&quot;

In 2000, Cooper played Colonel Harry Burwell (inspired by Lieutenant Colonel Henry &quot;Light Horse Harry&quot; Lee) in &quot;The Patriot&quot;. He was nominated for another Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and a Golden Globe Award in 2003 for playing the role of John Laroche in &quot;Adaptation.&quot; In 2002, Cooper also appeared in &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; as a ruthless CIA special ops director, a role he reprised (in flashbacks) in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;.

Cooper received another Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for his supporting role as racehorse trainer Tom Smith in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;. In 2004, Cooper starred in &quot;Silver City&quot;, playing an inept Republican gubernatorial candidate, a character noted for similarities to U.S. President George W. Bush.

Cooper appeared in three acclaimed films in 2005: &quot;Jarhead&quot; (which reunited him with &quot;American Beauty&quot; director Sam Mendes and &quot;October Sky&quot; actor Jake Gyllenhaal); &quot;Capote&quot;; and &quot;Syriana&quot;. He also acted in the thriller &quot;Breach&quot;, playing real-life FBI agent and traitor Robert Hanssen. Cooper commented that &quot;Breach&quot; was &quot;the first studio film where they&#x27;ve considered me the lead [actor]&quot;. In 2007, he appeared as a government agent in dangerous territory in the action thriller &quot;The Kingdom&quot; and voiced the character Douglas in the film adaptation of Maurice Sendak&#x27;s book, &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; (2009).

At the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, Cooper appeared alongside Ben Affleck in &quot;The Company Men&quot;, early reviews of which praised Cooper&#x27;s performance as &quot;pitch-perfect&quot;.

In 2011, Chris Cooper appeared in &quot;The Muppets&quot; as Tex Richman, the antagonistic oil tycoon who is unable to laugh. In the musical film, Cooper performed the rap and dance number &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Me&quot;.

In 2013, he played Charles Aiken, Sr. in &quot;&quot; alongside an all-star cast that included Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. 

In 2017, he and Laurie Metcalf starred in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House, Part 2&quot;, a Broadway play by Lucas Hnath based on Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, for which he received a Tony Award nomination. Cooper played Nora Helmer&#x27;s husband, Torvald.

Cooper portrayed Norman Osborn in the 2014 film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;. He appeared in an uncredited role in Ben Affleck&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Live by Night&quot;, which was released in December 2016.

In 2019, Cooper starred in two acclaimed films, Marielle Heller&#x27;s &quot;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&quot;, with Tom Hanks, and Greta Gerwig&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot; with an ensemble cast featuring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern, and Meryl Streep.

In 2024, Cooper served as an executive producer of the documentary &quot;My Own Normal&quot; about Alexander Freeman, a filmmaker from Newton, Massachusetts who has cerebral palsy, following his journey of becoming a partner and father and confronting the pain of his parents&#x27; reaction. The documentary premiered at Independent Film Festival Boston. 

==Personal life==

Cooper met his future wife, Marianne Leone, in 1979 at an acting class in New York City. On their first date, she helped him carry sheet rock up eight flights of stairs: &quot;That&#x27;s when I knew this was the girl for me.&quot; They married in July 1983. Their son, Jesse Lanier Cooper, was born three months prematurely in October 1987. Three days after he was born, Jesse suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and developed cerebral palsy. Jesse was eventually mainstreamed into Silver Lake Regional High School, where he became an honor student. Cooper recalled in a 2003 interview with &quot;The Morning Call&quot;, &quot;(Jesse) is the best thing that ever happened to us. He&#x27;s in a wheelchair and he communicates only by computer, but he&#x27;s taught me so much because he&#x27;s just so incredibly focused. Now he&#x27;s in a regular school, which we fought to get him into. He&#x27;s an honors student, and he&#x27;s doing great.&quot; On January 3, 2005, Jesse Cooper died suddenly and unexpectedly from epilepsy. A memorial fund was set up in his name, the Jesse Cooper Foundation. Cooper has said that the death of his son has somewhat helped him understand several characters he played, such as Charles Aiken in &quot;&quot; (2013) and Phil Eastwood in &quot;Demolition&quot; (2015).

Cooper formerly maintained residences in Hoboken, New Jersey, and Plymouth, Massachusetts. As of 2003, he resides in Kingston, Massachusetts. He has been close friends with frequent collaborator John Sayles since 1985. On May 14, 2016, Cooper received an honorary doctorate from the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

He and his wife Marianne adopt and live with rescue dogs.

<doc id="580146" wikidata="Q508967" url="?curid=580146" title="Operation Valkyrie">
<text>Operation Valkyrie () was a German World War II emergency continuity-of-government operations plan issued to the Territorial Reserve Army of Germany to implement in the event of a general breakdown in national civil order due to Allied bombing of German cities, or an uprising of the millions of foreign forced labourers working in German factories.

German Army (&quot;Heer&quot;) officers, General Friedrich Olbricht, Major General Henning von Tresckow and Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg modified the plan with the intention of using it to take control of German cities, disarm the SS, and arrest the Nazi leadership once Hitler had been assassinated in the 20 July plot. Hitler&#x27;s death (as opposed to his arrest) was required to free German soldiers from their oath of loyalty to him (&quot;Reichswehreid&quot;). After lengthy preparation, the plot was activated in 1944, but failed.

==The original operation==
The original plan, designed to deal with internal disturbances in emergency situations, ensured combat readiness of units among scattered elements of the Reserve Army. It was developed by General Friedrich Olbricht&#x27;s staff in his capacity as head of General Army Office and was approved by Hitler. However, apart from Hitler himself, only Colonel-General Friedrich Fromm, Chief of the Reserve Army since 1938, could initiate Operation Valkyrie.

== Coup-oriented revisions ==
The idea of using the Reserve Army in the German homeland to unseat the Nazi regime had existed before, but Fromm&#x27;s refusal to cooperate in a prospective coup posed a serious obstacle to the conspirators. Nevertheless, after the lessons of a failed assassination attempt on 13 March 1943, Olbricht felt that the original coup plan—which anticipated a more spontaneous uprising—was inadequate and that the Reserve Army should be used even without Fromm&#x27;s cooperation.

The original Valkyrie order only dealt with combat readiness of Reserve Army units. Olbricht added a second part, &#x27;Valkyrie II&#x27;, which provided for the swift mustering of these units into battle groups ready for action.

In August and September 1943, co-conspirator Major General Henning von Tresckow, finding Olbricht&#x27;s revision inadequate, greatly expanded the Valkyrie plan by new supplementary orders that undermined the staunchest Nazi institutions by implicating them in Hitler&#x27;s death. A secret declaration began with the words: &quot;The Führer Adolf Hitler is dead! A treacherous group of party leaders has attempted to exploit the situation by attacking our embattled soldiers from the rear to seize power for themselves.&quot;

With this premise securing the credible motivation for the Reserve Army to seize control of the organs of state, detailed instructions were written for the occupation of government ministries in Berlin, of Himmler&#x27;s headquarters in East Prussia, of radio stations, of telephone exchanges, of other Nazi infrastructure through military districts and of concentration camps. (Previously, it was believed that Colonel Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg was mainly responsible for the Valkyrie plan, but documents recovered by the Soviet Union after the war and released in 2007 suggest that a detailed plan was developed by Tresckow in autumn 1943.) All documents were handled by Tresckow&#x27;s wife, Erika, and by Margarete von Oven, his secretary. Both women wore gloves so as to leave no fingerprints.

In essence, the coup plan involved tricking the Reserve Army into the seizure and removal of the civilian government and paramilitary organizations of wartime Germany under the false pretence that the SS had attempted a coup and assassinated Hitler. The conspirators depended on the assumption that the rank-and-file soldiers and junior officers designated to execute Operation Valkyrie would be motivated to do so on the basis of their false belief that the Nazi civilian leadership had behaved with disloyalty and treason against the state and the leader to whom the army has sworn allegiance, and were therefore required to be removed. The conspirators counted on the soldiers to obey their orders so long as they came from a legitimate channel—namely, the Reserve Army High Command—in the emergency situation following Hitler&#x27;s putative death.

Apart from Hitler, only Colonel-General Friedrich Fromm, as commander of the Reserve Army, could activate Operation Valkyrie. For the planned coup to succeed, therefore, the plotters had either to win Fromm over to the conspiracy or to neutralize him in some way. Fromm, like many senior officers, knew about the military conspiracies against Hitler in general terms, but neither supported them nor reported them to the Gestapo.

The orders, which on July 20 were transmitted but never fully implemented, illustrate the scope and detail of the planning, as well as the dual military and political aims: The disarming of the SS and the SD, as well as the reorientation of governmental and military actions away from what the conspirators considered to be the lawlessness of the Nazi regime.

===Initial order to the Wehrkreise (Military Districts)===
===Order to General Government of Poland===

Particularly notable for its apparent anticipation of the release of &quot;political prisoners&quot; from concentration camps in the General Government of occupied Poland, this telex is preserved in the Bundesarchiv. See source matter.

==Execution==
The key role in its actual implementation was to be played by Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, after his assassination attempt on Hitler on 20 July 1944. Stauffenberg had also further improved the Valkyrie plan and made changes to address changing situations.

Stauffenberg&#x27;s position as Chief of Staff of the Reserve Army gave him access to Hitler for reports and at the same time required his presence at headquarters for implementation of Valkyrie. At first, Tresckow and Stauffenberg sought out other officers with access to Hitler who could carry out the assassination.

General Helmuth Stieff, Chief of Organization in Army High Command, volunteered to be the assassin but later backed down. Tresckow attempted several times to be assigned to Hitler&#x27;s headquarters without success. Finally, Stauffenberg decided to carry out both the assassination attempt and the Valkyrie operation, which greatly reduced the chance of success. After two abortive attempts, Stauffenberg placed the bomb on 20 July and hurried back to Berlin to assume his pivotal role.

Discovering from Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel that the bomb had not killed Hitler, Fromm refused to initiate Valkyrie, only to learn that General Friedrich Olbricht had initiated in his name; refusing to co-operate, he was removed and arrested by the conspirators and replaced by General Erich Hoepner. Meanwhile, Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel, military governor of occupied France, managed to disarm the SD and SS, and captured most of their leadership. He travelled to Günther von Kluge&#x27;s headquarters and asked him to contact the Allies, only to be informed that Hitler was alive.

By this time &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler had taken charge of the situation and had issued orders countermanding Olbricht&#x27;s mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie. This led to the failure of the coup, with most of the commanding officers learning that Hitler was alive and cancelling their operations.

When it was clear that the coup had failed, the less resolute members of the conspiracy in Berlin began to change sides. Fromm was freed from his detention room and, after a brief fight, he managed to regain control of the Bendlerblock. In a desperate attempt to cover his involvement, he ordered the executions of General Friedrich Olbricht, his chief of staff Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and his adjutant Lieutenant Werner von Haeften. Shortly after midnight, the condemned men were led to a mound of earth back-lit by idling vehicles where each was executed by firing squad in the courtyard of Bendlerstraße headquarters. (The street has since been renamed Stauffenbergstraße in honour of Colonel Stauffenberg.) Further executions were forbidden following the arrival of Waffen-SS personnel under the command of &quot;Obersturmbannfüher&quot; Otto Skorzeny.

<text>The palang () or ampallang is a male genital piercing that penetrates horizontally through the entire glans of the penis.

==History==

Penis piercings of proto-Malay origin predated European contact with tribes in (among others) the Philippines and Borneo (Dayak people). Thomas Cavendish claims that in the Philippines the practice was an invention of the women to prevent sodomy (the Philippines variant included a spur).

In Western culture, the ampallang became popular along with the many genital piercings practiced amongst the gay BDSM community prior to the establishment of the body piercing industry in the 1980s and 1990s. Due to its supposed authenticity, this piercing is closely associated with the modern primitive movement but anatomy and use of a palang differs drastically from a modern ampallang. Indeed, traditional palang design is simply a pin used to attach a wooden glans cape extension to the penis.

==Procedure==
The piercing may be &quot;transurethral&quot; (passing through the urethra) and named as the European ampallang, whereas the American ampallang is placed horizontally above the urethra, generally back toward the corona. A variant on this piercing is the shaft ampallang, which penetrates the shaft of the penis horizontally at any point along its length. The counterpart to this piercing is the apadravya, which penetrates the glans vertically. The combination of an ampallang and an apadravya is sometimes referred to as the magic cross.

== Health issues ==
Ampallang is an advanced piercing, and the procedure can be extremely painful. Full healing usually takes between four and six months, but can take a year or more in an American ampallang.

The primary health issues related to this piercing are during the procedure itself and during the healing process. Depending on the placement, there can be a significant amount of blood loss, both during the procedure and during the initial healing process. The measurement for the piercing jewelry is typically done by the receiver in private on his erect penis, while the actual piercing is done on his flaccid penis. The long healing process requires that the bearer abstain from sexual intercourse for a lengthy period of time, on the order of six weeks to six months.

It is possible for this piercing to injure or damage the teeth and soft palate of the giving party during oral sex.

If this piercing is transurethral (&quot;European&quot;), it can divert the flow of urine, forcing the bearer to sit down or take other measures during urination. The piercing will leave a tube of scar tissue, which will remain even if the jewelry is removed and the piercing allowed to heal.

==Functions==
Ampallang, once healed, is often pleasurable to the bearer because it stimulates the internal penis tissues.

== Jewelry ==
Straight barbells are almost exclusively worn in ampallangs, both initially and after they are healed. Jewelry must be long enough to accommodate the expansion of the penis during erection, at the risk of significant discomfort for the wearer. After initial healing the piercing can be stretched and larger jewelry can be inserted, reaching sizes above 10 mm in diameter.

<doc id="580158" wikidata="Q731890" url="?curid=580158" title="Edward Bransfield">
<text>Edward Bransfield ( – 31 October 1852) was a Royal Navy officer who served as a master on several ships, after being impressed into service in Ireland at the age of 18. He is noted for his participation in several explorations of parts of Antarctica, including a sighting of the Trinity Peninsula in January 1820.

==Early life==
Edward Bransfield was born in Ballinacurra, County Cork . While little is known of Edward&#x27;s family or early life, the Bransfields are thought to have been a well-known and respected Catholic family. They may have had enough money to pay for Edward&#x27;s education, but because of the Penal Laws, it is more likely that he attended a local hedge school. On 2 June 1803, Bransfield, then eighteen years old, was removed by an press-gang from his father&#x27;s fishing boat and impressed into the Royal Navy.

He began as an ordinary seaman on the 110-gun first-rate ship of the line , where he shared living quarters with William Edward Parry, then a twelve-year-old midshipman; Parry later also became known in polar exploration. Bransfield was rated as an able seaman in 1805 and was appointed to the 110-gun first-rate (which had taken part in the Battle of Trafalgar); he was promoted in 1806 to able seaman, then 2nd master&#x27;s mate in 1808, midshipman in 1808, clerk in 1809, and midshipman again in 1811. By 1812, he had achieved the rank of second master, and in the same year he was made acting master on HMS &quot;Goldfinch&quot;, a 10-gun &quot;Cherokee&quot;-class brig-sloop.

Between the years 1814 and 1816, Bransfield served briefly as master on many fifth-rate ships. On 21 February 1816, he was appointed master of the 50-gun fourth-rate , leading it in the Bombardment of Algiers. During September 1817, he was appointed master of HMS &quot;Andromache&quot; under the command of Captain W. H. Shirreff. It was during this tour of duty that he was posted to the Royal Navy&#x27;s new Pacific Squadron off Valparaíso in Chile.

==Antarctic exploration==
During 1773, James Cook sailed beyond the Antarctic Circle, noting with pride in his journal that he was &quot;undoubtedly the first that ever crossed that line.&quot; The next year, Cook circumnavigated Antarctica completely and reached a latitude of 71°10&#x27;S before being driven back by the ice. Although Cook failed to see Antarctica, he dispelled once and for all the myth that a fertile, populous continent surrounded the South Pole. The Admiralty lost interest in the Antarctic and turned its attention to the ongoing search for the Northwest Passage. Almost half a century passed before anyone else is known to have travelled as far south as Cook.

In February 1819, while rounding Cape Horn, William Smith, the owner and skipper of the English merchant ship William, was driven south by adverse winds and discovered what came to be known as the South Shetland Islands. When news of his discovery reached Valparaíso, Captain Shirreff of the Royal Navy decided that the matter warranted further investigation. He chartered &quot;William&quot; and appointed Bransfield, two midshipmen, and the surgeon from the ship HMS &quot;Slaney&quot; to survey the newly discovered islands. Smith remained aboard, acting as Bransfield&#x27;s pilot.

After a brief and uneventful voyage into the Southern Ocean, Bransfield and Smith reached the South Shetland Islands. Bransfield landed on King George Island and took formal possession on behalf of King George III (who had died the day before, on 29 January 1820). He then proceeded in a southwesterly direction past Deception Island, not investigating or charting it. Turning south, he crossed what is now known as the Bransfield Strait (named for him by James Weddell in 1822), and on 30 January 1820 sighted Trinity Peninsula, the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland. &quot;Such was the discovery of Antarctica,&quot; writes the English writer Roland Huntford. Bransfield made a note in his log of two &quot;high mountains, covered with snow&quot;, one of which was subsequently named Mount Bransfield by Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville in his honour.

Unknown to Bransfield, two days earlier, on 28 January 1820, Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen may have caught sight of an icy shoreline now known to be part of East Antarctica. On the basis of this sighting and the coordinates given in his logbook, Bellingshausen has been credited by some (e.g., British polar historian A. G. E. Jones) with the discovery of the continent.

Having charted a segment of the Trinity Peninsula, Bransfield followed the edge of the Antarctic ice sheet in a northeasterly direction and discovered various points on Elephant Island and Clarence Island, which he also formally claimed for the British Crown. He did not sail around Elephant Island and did not name it, although he charted Clarence Island completely.

When Bransfield returned to Valparaíso, he gave his charts and journal to Captain Shirreff, who delivered them to the Admiralty. The original charts are still in the possession of the hydrographic department in Taunton, Somerset, but Bransfield&#x27;s journal has been lost. The Admiralty, it seems, was still more interested in the search for the Northwest Passage. Two private accounts of Bransfield&#x27;s historic voyage were published during 1821. During recent years the journal of one of the midshipmen, Charles Poynter, was discovered in New Zealand. An account has been published by the Hakluyt Society, edited by Richard Campbell, RN.

==Later life==
The remainder of Bransfield&#x27;s life is obscure. He died on 31 October 1852 at the age of 66 or 67, and was buried in the Brighton Extra-Mural Cemetery in southern England. His wife survived him and was buried in the same grave after her death in 1863.

==Legacy and honors==
Bransfield Island, Bransfield Strait, Bransfield Trough, Bransfield Rocks, and Mount Bransfield were all named in his honour.

In 1999, Edward Bransfield&#x27;s grave, discovered in a deteriorated state in a Brighton churchyard, was renovated (funded by charitable donations) by Sheila Bransfield. In 2002, she completed a master&#x27;s thesis on his role in the discovery of Antarctica at the Greenwich Maritime Institute. The event was marked by a ceremony attended by numerous dignitaries.

In 2000, the Royal Mail issued a commemorative stamp in Bransfield&#x27;s honour, but as no likeness of him could be found, the stamp depicted instead RRS &quot;Bransfield&quot;, an Antarctic surveying vessel named after him.

In January 2020, on the 200th anniversary of his discovery of Antarctica, a commemorative monument was unveiled in his hometown of Ballinacurra, in County Cork, Ireland. On the same day a blue plaque was unveiled at his former home at 11 Clifton Road, Brighton.

<doc id="580161" wikidata="Q1968423" url="?curid=580161" title="Pyramid power">
<text>Pyramid power is the belief that the pyramids of ancient Egypt and objects of similar shape can confer a variety of benefits. Among these supposed properties are the ability to preserve foods, sharpen or maintain the sharpness of razor blades, improve health, function &quot;as a thought-form incubator&quot;, trigger sexual urges, and cause other effects. Such unverified conjectures regarding pyramids are collectively known as pyramidology.

There is no evidence that pyramid power exists.

== History ==
In the 1930s, a French ironmonger and pendulum-dowsing author, Antoine Bovis, developed the idea that small models of pyramids can preserve food. The story persists that Bovis, while standing inside the King&#x27;s Chamber of the Great Pyramid in Egypt, saw a garbage can inside the chamber piled with dead animals that had wandered into the structure, noticed that these small carcasses were not decaying and inferred that the structure somehow preserved them. However, Bovis never claimed to have visited Egypt. In his self-published French-language booklet Bovis ascribes his discovery to reasoning and experiments in Europe using a dowsing pendulum:

In 1949, inspired by Bovis, a Czechoslovakian named Karel Drbal applied for a patent on a &quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s shaving device&quot;, a model pyramid alleged to maintain the sharpness of razor blades. According to the patent (#91,304), &quot;The method of maintaining the razor blades and straight razor blades sharp by placing them in the magnetic field in such a way that the sharp edge lies in the direction of the magnetic lines.&quot; Drbal alleged that his device would focus &quot;the earth&#x27;s magnetic field&quot;, although he did not make it clear how this would work, or whether the device&#x27;s shape or materials exerted the effect.

Drbal&#x27;s contention that razors could be sharpened or have their sharpness maintained by alignment with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field was not new. In 1933, &quot;The Times&quot; carried letters claiming, &quot;if I oriented my razor blades... N. and S. by the compass... they tend to last considerably longer&quot; and &quot;The idea of keeping razor blades in a magnetic field is not quite new. About the year 1900 I found this out&quot;.

Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder, authors of the paranormal, visited Czechoslovakia in 1968, where they happened upon a cardboard pyramid manufactured commercially by Drbal. They met Drbal, and dedicated a chapter of their popular 1970 book &quot;Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain&quot; to pyramid power. This book introduced both the concept of pyramid power and the story about Antoine Bovis to the English-speaking world.

== Origin of the term ==
Debate continues over who coined the term &quot;pyramid power&quot;. Author Max Toth has claimed he coined the phrase, as has Patrick Flanagan. Both authors released books entitled &quot;Pyramid Power&quot; in the 1970s. According to Toth, this led to a lawsuit by Flanagan against him.

However, the term &quot;pyramid power&quot; in its current usage first appeared in print in Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder&#x27;s 1970 book &quot;Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain&quot;. Ostrander and Schroeder claim that &quot;Czechoslovakian researchers&quot; coined the term in the 1960s.

== Popularisation ==
The conjectures of pyramid power convinced the Onan Family, hotel and condo developers in Gurnee, Illinois, to build the &quot;Pyramid House&quot; in 1977.

Summerhill Pyramid Winery in Kelowna, British Columbia built a four-story replica of the Great Pyramid, alleged by the winery to improve the quality of wine aged within it.

A religion founded in 1975, called Summum, completed the construction of a pyramid called the Summum Pyramid in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1979.

Pyramid power was used by the Toronto Maple Leafs and their coach Red Kelly during the 1975–76 quarter-final series, to counter the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; use of Kate Smith&#x27;s rendering of &quot;God Bless America&quot;. Kelly hung a plastic model of a pyramid in the team&#x27;s clubhouse after a pair of away defeats at the start of the series, and each player took turns standing under it for exactly four minutes. The Maple Leafs managed to win all three of their home matches before losing the series&#x27; decisive game seven.

It is common in New Age magazines to see advertisements for open metal-poled pyramids large enough to meditate under. The New Age group Share International, founded by Benjamin Creme, practices a form of meditation called &#x27;Transmission Meditation&#x27; using an open metal-poled tetrahedron, which according to their beliefs tunes into the cosmic energy of Maitreya and other spiritual masters.

== Skepticism ==
The neurologist and skeptic Terence Hines has written that pyramid power is a pseudoscience and tests have failed to provide any evidence for its claims:

In 2005, an episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot; was aired on the Discovery Channel in which a basic test of pyramid power was performed, using pyramids built to the specifications found in pyramid power claims, reflecting the location of the King&#x27;s Chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza. Several claims were tested, concerning food rotting, a flower rotting and a razor blade going dull. With control protocols in place, there was no significant difference between items in pyramids and items outside.

== In popular culture ==
*Patrick Flanagan&#x27;s book was featured on the cover and in the lyrics of The Alan Parsons Project&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Pyramid&quot;. &quot;Pyramania&quot;, a song from the album, mocked the idea of pyramid power.
*Martin Gardner spoofed pyramid power in his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in the &quot;Scientific American&quot; issue of June 1974, featuring his recurring fictional characters Dr. Matrix and Iva Matrix.

* Terry Pratchett&#x27;s satiric fantasy novel &quot;Pyramids&quot; incorporates elements of the conjecture when an industry develops around pyramids&#x27; ability to manipulate time.

<doc id="580163" wikidata="Q16870144" url="?curid=580163" title="Geddes (surname)">
<text>Geddes ( , ) is a surname of English and Scottish origin. In Scotland and northern Ireland the name may be derived from the place-name Geddes in Nairn, Scotland. The &quot;Dictionary of American Family Names&quot; claims that the surname is more likely a patronymic name derived from the name &quot;Geddie&quot;, itself perhaps an altered form of MacAdam. In this way, the letter &quot;G&quot; represents the Scottish Gaelic &quot;mac&quot; &quot;son of&quot; and &quot;Eddie&quot; is a variant of Adam. &quot;Geddie&quot; may also be a nickname meaning &quot;greedy&quot;, derived from &quot;gedd&quot; meaning &quot;pike&quot;, this could also refer to a voracious eater. The earliest written record of the surname &quot;Geddes&quot; is of William &quot;Ged&quot;, from Shropshire, England, recorded within the Pipe Rolls in the year 1230. The surname Geddes can be represented in Scottish Gaelic as &quot;Geadasach&quot; and &quot;Geadais&quot;.

It has also been suggested that Geddes (&quot;Geadais&quot; in Scottish Gaelic) is an earlier Gaelic spelling for Cádiz, an ancient and important seaport in southern Spain (Latin &quot;Gādēs)&quot;. This proposal for the origin of the surname Geddes is based on several lines of evidence connecting people and place names in Scotland with Jewish trading routes to France and Spain.

<text>The Cadaver Synod (also called the Cadaver Trial; ) is the name commonly given to the ecclesiastical trial of Pope Formosus, who had been dead for about seven months, in the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome during January 897. The trial was conducted by Pope Stephen VI, the successor to Formosus&#x27; successor, Pope Boniface VI. Stephen had Formosus&#x27; corpse exhumed and brought to the papal court for judgment. He accused Formosus of perjury, of having acceded to the papacy illegally, and illegally presiding over more than one diocese at the same time. At the end of the trial, Formosus was pronounced guilty, and his papacy retroactively declared null.

==Context==
The Cadaver Synod and related events took place during a period of political instability in Italy. This period, which lasted from the middle of the 9th century to the middle of the 10th century, was marked by a rapid succession of pontiffs. Between 872 and 965, two dozen popes were appointed, and between 896 and 904 there was, on average, a new pope every year. Often, these brief papal reigns were the result of the political machinations of local Roman factions, about which few sources survive.

Formosus became bishop of Porto-Santa Rufina in 864 during the pontificate of Pope Nicholas I. In 866 he was sent as a legate to Bulgaria, and was so successful in this position that the Bulgarian ruler Boris I asked the pope to appoint him archbishop of Bulgaria. Nicholas refused to give permission, because the fifteenth canon of the Second Council of Nicaea forbade a bishop from administering more than one see — &quot;a law that was supposed to prevent bishops from building up their own little fiefdoms.&quot; He also travelled to Constantinople, and the Carolingian court, where he met Arnulf of Carinthia, a Frankish Carolingian king who aspired to the throne of Italy.
In 875, shortly after Charles the Bald&#x27;s imperial coronation, Formosus fled Rome in fear of then-pope John VIII. A few months later in 876, at a synod in Santa Maria Rotunda, John VIII issued a series of accusations against Formosus and some of his associates. He asserted that Formosus had corrupted the mind of the Bulgarians &quot;so that, so long as [Formosus] was alive, [they] would not accept any other bishop from the apostolic see,&quot; that he and his fellow conspirators had attempted to usurp the papacy from John, and finally that he had deserted his see in Porto and was conspiring &quot;against the salvation of the state and of our beloved Charles [the Bald].&quot; Formosus and his associates were excommunicated.

In 879, at another council held at Troyes, John may have confirmed the excommunications. He also legislated more generally against those who &quot;plunder&quot; ecclesiastical goods. According to the tenth-century author Auxilius of Naples, Formosus was also present at this council. According to Auxilius, Formosus begged the bishops for their forgiveness, and in return for removal of the excommunication, swore an oath to remain a layman for the rest of his life, to never again enter Rome, and to make no attempts to resume his former see at Porto. This story is dubious: another description of the synod does not mention Formosus&#x27;s presence, and says instead that John confirmed his excommunication.

After the death of John VIII in December 882, Formosus&#x27; troubles ended. He resumed his bishopric at Porto, where he remained until elected pope on 6 October 891. Yet this earlier quarrel with John VIII formed the basis of the accusations made at the Cadaver Synod. According to the tenth-century historian Liutprand of Cremona, Stephen VI asked Formosus&#x27; corpse why he &quot;usurped the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition&quot; after the death of John VIII, echoing John VIII&#x27;s own assertion that Formosus had tried to seize the papal throne while he was alive. Formosus, being several months dead, could not answer. Two further accusations were also made against Formosus at the Cadaver Synod: that he had committed perjury and that he had attempted to exercise the office of bishop as a layman. These are related to the oath Formosus is said to have sworn before the council at Troyes in 878.

==Immediate context==
The Cadaver Synod is generally presumed to have been politically motivated. Formosus crowned Lambert of Spoleto co-ruler of the Holy Roman Empire in 892; Lambert&#x27;s father, Guy III of Spoleto, had earlier been crowned by John VIII. In 893 Formosus, apparently nervous about Guy&#x27;s aggression, invited the Carolingian Arnulf of Carinthia to invade Italy and receive the imperial crown. Arnulf&#x27;s invasion failed, and Guy III died shortly afterwards. Yet Formosus renewed his invitation to Arnulf in 895, and early the next year Arnulf crossed the Alps and entered Rome, where Formosus crowned him as Holy Roman Emperor. Afterwards the Frankish army departed, and Arnulf and Formosus died within months of each other in 896. Formosus was succeeded by Pope Boniface VI, who himself died two weeks later. Lambert and his mother, the empress Angiltrude, entered Rome around the time that Stephen VI became pope, and the Cadaver Synod was conducted directly afterwards, at the beginning of 897.

The dominant interpretation of these events until the early twentieth century was straightforward: Formosus had always been a pro-Carolingian, and his crowning of Lambert in 892 was coerced. After the death of Arnulf and the collapse of Carolingian authority in Rome, Lambert entered the city and forced Stephen to convene the Cadaver Synod, both to re-assert his claim to the imperial crown and perhaps also to exact posthumous revenge upon Formosus.

This view is now considered obsolete, following the arguments put forth by Joseph Duhr in 1932. Duhr pointed out that Lambert was in attendance at the Ravenna Council of 898, convened under Pope John IX. It was at this proceeding that the decrees of the Cadaver Synod were revoked. According to the written &quot;acta&quot; of the council, Lambert actively approved of the nullification. If Lambert and Angiltrude had been the architects of Formosus&#x27;s degradation, Duhr asked, &quot;how [...] was John IX able to submit to the canons which condemned the odious synod for approbation of the emperor [i.e., Lambert] and his bishops? How could John IX have dared to broach the matter [...] before the guilty parties, without even making the least allusion to the emperor&#x27;s participation?&quot; This position has been accepted by another scholar: Girolamo Arnaldi argued that Formosus did not pursue an exclusively pro-Carolingian policy, and that he even had friendly relations with Lambert as late as 895. Their relations only soured when Lambert&#x27;s cousin, Guy IV of Spoleto, marched on Benevento and expelled the Byzantines there. Formosus panicked at the aggression and sent emissaries into Bavaria seeking Arnulf&#x27;s help. Arnaldi argues that it was Guy IV, who had entered Rome along with Lambert and his mother Angiltrude in January 897, who provided the impetus for the synod.

==Synod==
Probably around January 897, Stephen VI ordered that the corpse of his predecessor Formosus be removed from its tomb and brought to the papal court for judgment. With the corpse propped up on a throne, a deacon was appointed to answer for the deceased pontiff.

Formosus was accused of transmigrating sees in violation of canon law, of perjury, and of serving as a bishop while actually a layman. According to Liutprand, Stephen VI said: &quot;When you were bishop of Porto, why did you usurp the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition?&quot;

Eventually, the corpse was found guilty. Liutprand of Cremona and other sources say that, after having the corpse stripped of its papal vestments, Stephen then cut off the three fingers of the right hand that it had used in life for blessings, next formally invalidating all of Formosus&#x27; acts and ordinations (including his ordination of Stephen VI as bishop of Anagni). The body was finally interred in a graveyard for foreigners, only to be dug up once again, tied to weights, and cast into the Tiber River.

==Aftermath==
The macabre spectacle turned public opinion in Rome against Stephen. Formosus&#x27; body washed up on the banks of the Tiber, and rumor had it that his waterlogged rotting corpse was still performing miracles. A public uprising deposed and imprisoned Stephen. He was strangled in prison in July or August 897.

In December 897 Pope Theodore II (897) convened a synod that annulled the Cadaver Synod, rehabilitated Formosus, and ordered that his body, which had been recovered from the Tiber, be reburied in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in pontifical vestments. In 898, John IX (898–900) also nullified the Cadaver Synod, convening one synod in Rome, and another in Ravenna. The two synods which affirmed the findings of Theodore II&#x27;s synod, ordered the &quot;acta&quot; of the Cadaver Synod destroyed, excommunicated seven cardinals involved in the Cadaver Synod, and prohibited any future trial of a corpse.

<text>Link grammar (LG) is a theory of syntax by Davy Temperley and Daniel Sleator which builds relations between pairs of words, rather than constructing constituents in a phrase structure hierarchy. Link grammar is similar to dependency grammar, but dependency grammar includes a head-dependent relationship, whereas link grammar makes the head-dependent relationship optional (links need not indicate direction). Colored Multiplanar Link Grammar (CMLG) is an extension of LG allowing crossing relations between pairs of words. The relationship between words is indicated with link types, thus making the Link grammar closely related to certain categorial grammars.

For example, in a subject–verb–object language like English, the verb would look left to form a subject link, and right to form an object link. Nouns would look right to complete the subject link, or left to complete the object link.

In a subject–object–verb language like Persian, the verb would look left to form an object link, and a more distant left to form a subject link. Nouns would look to the right for both subject and object links.

== Overview ==
Link grammar connects the words in a sentence with links, similar in form to a catena. Unlike the catena or a traditional dependency grammar, the marking of the head-dependent relationship is optional for most languages, becoming mandatory only in free-word-order languages (such as Turkish, Finnish, Hungarian). That is, in English, the subject-verb relationship is &quot;obvious&quot;, in that the subject is almost always to the left of the verb, and thus no specific indication of dependency needs to be made. In the case of subject-verb inversion, a distinct link type is employed. For free word-order languages, this can no longer hold, and a link between the subject and verb must contain an explicit directional arrow to indicate which of the two words is which.

Link grammar also differs from traditional dependency grammars by allowing cyclic relations between words. Thus, for example, there can be links indicating both the head verb of a sentence, the head subject of the sentence, as well as a link between the subject and the verb. These three links thus form a cycle (a triangle, in this case). Cycles are useful in constraining what might otherwise be ambiguous parses; cycles help &quot;tighten up&quot; the set of allowable parses of a sentence.

For example, in the parse

 +----&gt;WV---&gt;+ 
 +--Wd--+-Ss-+--Pa--+
 LEFT-WALL he runs fast

the LEFT-WALL indicates the start of the sentence, or the root node. The directional WV link (with arrows) points at the head verb of the sentence; it is the Wall-Verb link. The Wd link (drawn here without arrows) indicates the head noun (the subject) of the sentence. The link type Wd indicates both that it connects to the wall (W) and that the sentence is a declarative sentence (the lower-case &quot;d&quot; subtype). The Ss link indicates the subject-verb relationship; the lower-case &quot;s&quot; indicating that the subject is singular. Note that the WV, Wd and Ss links for a cycle. The Pa link connects the verb to a complement; the lower-case &quot;a&quot; indicating that it is a predicative adjective in this case.

== Parsing algorithm ==
Parsing is performed in analogy to assembling a jigsaw puzzle (representing the parsed sentence) from puzzle pieces (representing individual words). A language is represented by means of a dictionary or lexis, which consists of words and the set of allowed &quot;jigsaw puzzle shapes&quot; that each word can have. The shape is indicated by a &quot;connector&quot;, which is a link-type, and a direction indicator + or - indicating right or left. Thus for example, a transitive verb may have the connectors S- &amp; O+ indicating that the verb may form a Subject (&quot;S&quot;) connection to its left (&quot;-&quot;) and an object connection (&quot;O&quot;) to its right (&quot;+&quot;). Similarly, a common noun may have the connectors D- &amp; S+ indicating that it may connect to a determiner on the left (&quot;D-&quot;) and act as a subject, when connecting to a verb on the right (&quot;S+&quot;). The act of parsing is then to identify that the S+ connector can attach to the S- connector, forming an &quot;S&quot; link between the two words. Parsing completes when all connectors have been connected.

A given word may have dozens or even hundreds of allowed puzzle-shapes (termed &quot;disjuncts&quot;): for example, many verbs may be optionally transitive, thus making the O+ connector optional; such verbs might also take adverbial modifiers (E connectors) which are inherently optional. More complex verbs may have additional connectors for indirect objects, or for particles or prepositions. Thus, a part of parsing also involves picking one single unique disjunct for a word; the final parse must satisfy (connect) &quot;all&quot; connectors for that disjunct.

===Dependency===
Connectors may also include head-dependent indicators h and d. In this case, a connector containing a head indicator is only allowed to connect to a connector containing the dependent indicator (or to a connector without any h-d indicators on it). When these indicators are used, the link is decorated with arrows to indicate the link direction.

A recent extension simplifies the specification of connectors for languages that have little or no restrictions on word-order, such as Lithuanian. There are also extensions to make it easier to support languages with concatenative morphologies.

===Planarity===
The parsing algorithm also requires that the final graph is a planar graph, i.e. that no links cross. This constraint is based on empirical psycho-linguistic evidence that, indeed, for most languages, in nearly all situations, dependency links really do not cross. There are rare exceptions, e.g. in Finnish, and even in English; they can be parsed by link-grammar only by introducing more complex and selective connector types to capture these situations.

=== Costs and selection ===
Connectors can have an optional floating-point cost markup, so that some are &quot;cheaper&quot; to use than others, thus giving preference to certain parses over others. That is, the total cost of parse is the sum of the individual costs of the connectors that were used; the cheapest parse indicates the most likely parse. This is used for parse-ranking multiple ambiguous parses. The fact that the costs are local to the connectors, and are not a global property of the algorithm makes them essentially Markovian in nature.

The assignment of a log-likelihood to linkages allows link grammar to implement the semantic selection of predicate-argument relationships. That is, certain constructions, although syntactically valid, are extremely unlikely. In this way, link grammar embodies some of the ideas present in operator grammar.

Because the costs are additive, they behave like the logarithm of the probability (since log-likelihoods are additive), or equivalently, somewhat like the entropy (since entropies are additive). This makes link grammar compatible with machine learning techniques such as hidden Markov models and the Viterbi algorithm, because the link costs correspond to the link weights in Markov networks or Bayesian networks.

=== Type theory ===
The link grammar link types can be understood to be the types in the sense of type theory. In effect, the link grammar can be used to model the internal language of certain (non-symmetric) compact closed categories, such as pregroup grammars. In this sense, link grammar appears to be isomorphic or homomorphic to some categorial grammars. Thus, for example, in a categorial grammar the noun phrase &quot;the bad boy&quot; may be written as

:formula_1

whereas the corresponding disjuncts in link grammar would be

 the: D+;
 bad: A+;
 boy: D- &amp; A-;

The contraction rules (inference rules) of the Lambek calculus can be mapped to the connecting of connectors in link grammar. The + and - directional indicators correspond the forward and backward-slashes of the categorical grammar. Finally, the single-letter names A and D can be understood as labels or &quot;easy-to-read&quot; mnemonic names for the rather more verbose types &quot;NP/N&quot;, etc.

The primary distinction here is then that the categorical grammars have two type constructors, the forward and backward slashes, that can be used to create new types (such as &quot;NP/N&quot;) from base types (such as &quot;NP&quot; and &quot;N&quot;). Link-grammar omits the use of type constructors, opting instead to define a much larger set of base types having compact, easy-to-remember mnemonics.

== Examples ==

=== Example 1 ===
A basic rule file for an SVO language might look like:

 &lt;determiner&gt; D+;
 &lt;noun-subject&gt; {D−} &amp; S+;
 &lt;noun-object&gt; {D−} &amp; O−;
 &lt;verb&gt; S− &amp; {O+};

Thus the English sentence, &quot;The boy painted a picture&quot; would appear as:

 +-----O-----+
 +-D-+--S--+ +--D--+
 The boy painted a picture

Similar parses apply for Chinese.

=== Example 2 ===
Conversely, a rule file for a null subject SOV language might consist of the following links:

 &lt;noun-subject&gt; S+;
 &lt;noun-object&gt; O+;
 &lt;verb&gt; {O−} &amp; {S−};

And a simple Persian sentence, &quot;man nAn xordam&quot; (من نان خوردم) &#x27;I ate bread&#x27; would look like:

 +-----S-----+
 | +--O--+
 man nAn xordam

VSO order can be likewise accommodated, such as for Arabic.

=== Example 3 (morphology) ===
In many languages with a concatenative morphology, the stem plays no grammatical role; the grammar is determined by the suffixes. Thus, in Russian, the sentence &#x27;вверху плыли редкие облачка&#x27; might have the parse:

 +------------Wd-----------+---------------SIp---------------+
 | +-------EI------+ +--------Api-------+
 | | +--LLCZD-+ +-LLAQZ+ +--LLCAO-+
 LEFT-WALL вверху.e плы.= =ли.vnndpp ре.= =дкие.api облачк.= =а.ndnpi

The subscripts, such as &#x27;.vnndpp&#x27;, are used to indicate the grammatical category. The primary links: Wd, EI, SIp and Api connect together the suffixes, as, in principle, other stems could appear here, without altering the structure of the sentence. The Api link indicates the adjective; SIp denotes subject-verb inversion; EI is a modifier. The Wd link is used to indicate the head noun; the head verb is not indicated in this sentence. The LLXXX links serve only to attach stems to suffixes.

=== Example 4 (phonology) ===
The link-grammar can also indicate phonological agreement between neighboring words. For example:

 +---------Ost--------+
 +------&gt;WV------&gt;+ +------Ds**x-----+
 +----Wd---+-Ss*b-+ +--PHv-+----A----+
 LEFT-WALL that.j-p is.v an abstract.a concept.n

Here, the connector &#x27;PH&#x27; is used to constrain the determiners that can appear before the word &#x27;abstract&#x27;. It effectively blocks (makes it costly) to use the determiner &#x27;a&#x27; in this sentence, while the link to &#x27;an&#x27; becomes cheap. The other links are roughly as in previous examples: S denoting subject, O denoting object, D denoting determiner. The &#x27;WV&#x27; link indicates the head verb, and the &#x27;W&#x27; link indicates the head noun. The lower-case letters following the upper-case link types serve to refine the type; so for example, Ds can only connect to a singular noun; Ss only to a singular subject, Os to a singular object. The lower-case v in PHv denotes &#x27;vowel&#x27;; the lower-case d in Wd denotes a declarative sentence.

=== Example 5 (Vietnamese) ===
The Vietnamese language sentence &quot;Bữa tiệc hôm qua là một thành công lớn&quot; - &quot;The party yesterday was a great success&quot; may be parsed as follows:

==Implementations==

The link grammar syntax parser is a library for natural language processing written in C. It is available under the LGPL license. The parser is an ongoing project. Recent versions include improved sentence coverage, Russian, Persian and Arabic language support, prototypes for German, Hebrew, Lithuanian, Vietnamese and Turkish, and programming API&#x27;s for Python, Java, Common LISP, AutoIt and OCaml, with 3rd-party bindings for Perl, Ruby and JavaScript node.js.

A current major undertaking is a project to learn the grammar and morphology of new languages, using unsupervised learning algorithms.

The &quot;link-parser&quot; program along with rules and word lists for English may be found in standard Linux distributions, e.g., as a Debian package, although many of these are years out of date.

==Applications==
AbiWord, a free word processor, uses link grammar for on-the-fly grammar checking. Words that cannot be linked anywhere are underlined in green.

The semantic relationship extractor RelEx, layered on top of the link grammar library, generates a dependency grammar output by making explicit the semantic relationships between words in a sentence. Its output can be classified as being at a level between that of SSyntR and DSyntR of Meaning-Text Theory. It also provides framing/grounding, anaphora resolution, head-word identification, lexical chunking, part-of-speech identification, and tagging, including entity, date, money, gender, etc. tagging. It includes a compatibility mode to generate dependency output compatible with the Stanford parser, and Penn Treebank-compatible POS tagging.

Link grammar has also been employed for information extraction of 
biomedical texts and 
events described in news articles, as well as experimental machine translation systems from English to German, Turkish, Indonesian. and Persian.

The link grammar link dictionary is used to generate and verify the syntactic correctness of three different natural language generation systems: NLGen, NLGen2 and microplanner/surreal. It is also used as a part of the NLP pipeline in the OpenCog AI project.

<text>The inode (index node) is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a file-system object such as a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes and disk block locations of the object&#x27;s data. File-system object attributes may include metadata (times of last change, access, modification), as well as owner and permission data.

A directory is a list of inodes with their assigned names. The list includes an entry for itself, its parent, and each of its children.

==Etymology==
There has been uncertainty on the Linux kernel mailing list about the reason for the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;inode&quot;. In 2002, the question was brought to Unix pioneer Dennis Ritchie, who replied: 

A 1978 paper by Ritchie and Ken Thompson bolsters the notion of &quot;index&quot; being the etymological origin of inodes. They wrote: Additionally, Maurice J. Bach wrote that the word &quot;inode&quot; &quot;is a contraction of the term index node and is commonly used in literature on the UNIX system&quot;.

==Details==
A file system relies on data structures &quot;about&quot; the files, as opposed to the contents of that file. The former are called &quot;metadata&quot;—data that describes data. Each file is associated with an &quot;inode&quot;, which is identified by an integer, often referred to as an &quot;i-number&quot; or &quot;inode number&quot;.

Inodes store information about files and directories (folders), such as file ownership, access mode (read, write, execute permissions), and file type. The data may be called stat data, in reference to the codice_1 system call that provides the data to programs.

The inode number indexes a table of inodes on the file system. From the inode number, the kernel&#x27;s file system driver can access the inode contents, including the location of the file, thereby allowing access to the file. A file&#x27;s inode number can be found using the codice_2 command. The codice_2 command prints the inode number in the first column of the report.

On many older file systems, inodes are stored in one or more fixed-size areas that are set up at file system creation time, so the maximum number of inodes is fixed at file system creation, limiting the maximum number of files the file system can hold. A typical allocation heuristic for inodes in a file system is one inode for every 2K bytes contained in the filesystem.

Some Unix-style file systems such as JFS, XFS, ZFS, OpenZFS, ReiserFS, btrfs, and APFS omit a fixed-size inode table, but must store equivalent data in order to provide equivalent capabilities. Common alternatives to the fixed-size table include B-trees and the derived B+ trees.

File names and directory implications:
* Inodes do not contain their hard link names, only other file metadata.
* Unix directories are lists of association structures, each of which contains one filename and one inode number.
* The file system driver must search a directory for a particular filename and then convert the filename to the correct corresponding inode number.

The operating system kernel&#x27;s in-memory representation of this data is called codice_4 in Linux. Systems derived from BSD use the term codice_5 (the &quot;v&quot; refers to the kernel&#x27;s virtual file system layer).

==POSIX inode description==
The POSIX standard mandates file-system behavior that is strongly influenced by traditional UNIX file systems. An inode is denoted by the phrase &quot;file serial number&quot;, defined as a &quot;per-file system&quot; unique identifier for a file. That file serial number, together with the device ID of the device containing the file, uniquely identify the file within the whole system.

Within a POSIX system, a file has the following attributes which may be retrieved by the codice_6 system call:
* Device ID (this identifies the device containing the file; that is, the scope of uniqueness of the serial number).
* File serial numbers.
* The file &quot;mode&quot; which determines the file type and how the file&#x27;s owner, its group, and others can access the file.
* A link count telling how many hard links point to the inode.
* The User ID of the file&#x27;s owner.
* The Group ID of the file.
* The device ID of the file if it is a device file.
* The size of the file in bytes.
* Timestamps telling when the inode itself was last modified (, &quot;inode change time&quot;), the file content last modified (, &quot;modification time&quot;), and last accessed (, &quot;access time&quot;).
* The preferred I/O block size.
* The number of blocks allocated to this file.

==Implications==
Filesystems designed with inodes will have the following administrative characteristics:

===Multi-named files and hard links===

Files can have multiple names. If multiple names hard link to the same inode then the names are equivalent; i.e., the first to be created has no special status. This is unlike symbolic links, which depend on the original name, not the inode (number).

===inode persistence and unlinked files===

An inode may have no links. An inode without links represents a file with no remaining directory entries or paths leading to it in the filesystem. A file that has been deleted or lacks directory entries pointing to it is termed an &#x27;unlinked&#x27; file. 

Such files are removed from the filesystem, freeing the occupied disk space for reuse. An inode without links remains in the filesystem until the resources (disk space and blocks) freed by the unlinked file are deallocated or the file system is modified.

Although an unlinked file becomes invisible in the filesystem, its deletion is deferred until all processes with access to the file have finished using it, including executable files which are implicitly held open by the processes executing them.

===inode number conversion and file directory path retrieval===

It is typically not possible to map from an open file to the filename that was used to open it. When a program opens a file, the operating system converts the filename to an inode number and then discards the filename. As a result, functions like  and  which retrieve the current working directory of the process, cannot directly access the filename.

Beginning with the current directory, these functions search up to its parent directory, then to the parent&#x27;s parent, and so on, until reaching the root directory. At each level, the function looks for a directory entry whose inode matches that of the directory it just moved up from. Because the child directory&#x27;s inode still exists as an entry in its parent directory, it allows the function to reconstruct the absolute path of the current working directory.

Some operating systems maintain extra information to make this operation run faster. For example, in the Linux VFS, directory entry cache, also known as dentry or dcache, are cache entries used by the kernel to speed up filesystem operations by storing information about directory links in RAM.

===Historical possibility of directory hard linking===

Historically, it was possible to hard link directories. This made the directory structure an arbitrary directed graph contrary to a directed acyclic graph. It was even possible for a directory to be its own parent. Modern systems generally prohibit this confusing state, except that the parent of &quot;root&quot; is still defined as root. The most notable exception to this prohibition is found in Mac OS X (versions 10.5 and higher) which allows hard links of directories to be created on HFS+ file systems by the superuser.

===inode number stability and non-Unix file systems===

When a file is relocated to a different directory on the same file system, or when a disk defragmentation alters its physical location, the file&#x27;s inode number remains unchanged.

This unique characteristic permits the file to be moved or renamed even during read or write operations, thereby ensuring continuous access without disruptions.

This feature—having a file&#x27;s metadata and data block locations persist in a central data structure, irrespective of file renaming or moving—cannot be fully replicated in many non-Unix file systems like FAT and its derivatives, as they lack a mechanism to maintain this invariant property when both the file&#x27;s directory entry and its data are simultaneously relocated. In these file systems, moving or renaming a file might lead to more significant changes in the data structure representing the file, and the system does not keep a separate, central record of the file&#x27;s data block locations and metadata as inodes do in Unix-like systems.

===Simplified library installation with inode file systems===

inode file systems allow a running process to continue accessing a library file even as another process is replacing that same file.

This operation should be performed atomically, meaning it should appear as a single operation that is either entirely completed or not done at all, with no intermediate state visible to other processes.

During the replacement, a new inode is created for the new library file, establishing an entirely new mapping. Subsequently, future access requests for that library will retrieve the newly installed version.

When the operating system is replacing the file (and creating a new inode), it places a lock on the inode and possibly the containing directory. This prevents other processes from reading or writing to the file (inode) during the update operation, thereby avoiding data inconsistency or corruption.

Once the update operation is complete, the lock is released. Any subsequent access to the file (via the inode) by any processes will now point to the new version of the library. Thus, making it possible to perform updates even when the library is in use by another process.

One significant advantage of this mechanism is that it eliminates the need for a system reboot to replace libraries currently in use. Consequently, systems can update or upgrade software libraries seamlessly without interrupting running processes or operations.

===Potential for inode exhaustion and solutions===

When a file system is created, some file systems allocate a fixed number of inodes. This means that it is possible to run out of inodes on a file system, even if there is free space remaining in the file system. This situation often arises in use cases where there are many small files, such as on a server storing email messages, because each file, no matter how small, requires its own inode.

Other file systems avoid this limitation by using dynamic inode allocation. Dynamic inode allocation allows a file system to create more inodes as needed instead of relying on a fixed number created at the time of file system creation. This can &quot;grow&quot; the file system by increasing the number of inodes available for new files and directories, thus avoiding the problem of running out of inodes.

==Inlining==
It can make sense to store very small files in the inode itself to save both space (no data block needed) and lookup time (no further disk access needed). This file system feature is called inlining. The strict separation of inode and file data thus can no longer be assumed when using modern file systems.

If the data of a file fits in the space allocated for pointers to the data, this space can conveniently be used. For example, ext2 and its successors store the data of symlinks (typically file names) in this way if the data is no more than 60 bytes (&quot;fast symbolic links&quot;).

Ext4 has a file system option called codice_7 that allows ext4 to perform inlining if enabled during file system creation. Because an inode&#x27;s size is limited, this only works for very small files.

== In non-Unix systems ==
* NTFS has a master file table (MFT) storing files in a B-tree. Each entry has a &quot;fileID&quot;, analogous to the inode number, that uniquely refers to this entry. The three timestamps, a device ID, attributes, reference count, and file sizes are found in the entry, but unlike in POSIX the permissions are expressed through a different API. The on-disk layout is more complex. The earlier FAT file systems did not have such a table and were incapable of making hard links.
** NTFS also has a concept of inlining small files into the MFT entry.
** The derived ReFS has a homologous MFT. ReFS has a 128-bit file ID; this extension was also backported to NTFS, which originally had a 64-bit file ID.
* The same stat-like API can be used on Cluster Shared Volumes, so it presumably has a similar concept of a file ID.

<text>The Denmark national football team ( or &quot;herrelandsholdet&quot;) represents Denmark and Greenland in men&#x27;s international football competitions. It is controlled by the Danish Football Association (DBU), the governing body for the football clubs which are organised under DBU. Denmark&#x27;s home stadium is Parken Stadium in the Østerbro district of Copenhagen.

Denmark were winners of the unofficial 1906 Intercalated Games football competition and silver medalists at the 1908 and 1912 Olympics. However, as amateurs who prohibited their internationals from becoming professionals at foreign clubs, Denmark did not qualify for the FIFA World Cup until 1986, although they won another Olympic silver in 1960.

Since the 1980s and the &quot;Danish Dynamite&quot; team, Denmark has remained competitive in international tournaments. Triumph in the 1992 European Championship in Sweden marked the team&#x27;s most prominent victory, defeating defending champions the Netherlands in the semi-final and world champions Germany in the final. They also won the 1995 King Fahd Cup, defeating Argentina in the final. Their best World Cup result was achieved in 1998, where they narrowly lost 3–2 in a quarter-final against Brazil. Denmark also made the round of 16 in 1986, 2002 and 2018. Their most prominent result in recent history was at Euro 2020, where the team lost in the semi-final against England after extra time.

==Teams==

Apart from the men&#x27;s senior A-level team, Denmark competes with a women&#x27;s national team, and has teams at various youth levels for both men and women, most prominently the under-21 national team. Historically, the A-level team competed in the Olympics until and including the 1988 tournament, whereafter Olympic games count as under-21 national games. In addition to the A-level team and youth teams, Denmark also has a special league national team named Ligalandsholdet, with the best Danish footballers from the Nordic leagues. The Ligalandsholdet was created in January 1983, and has played unofficial games for the national team during the winter break of the Nordic leagues every year since, save for 2005 and 2011. Sometimes the media also refer to Ligalandsholdet as Denmark&#x27;s B-team, as the best Danish footballers selected for the A-team often play in leagues outside of the Nordic countries. As such, the national team coach has on several occasions outlined the purpose of having unofficial matches played by Ligalandsholdet as an opportunity of testing new potential upcoming Danish players for the A-team.

==History==

===Amateur years===
On 12 April 1896, Denmark XI defeated Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon, either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games.

On 18 April 1897, a game was played in Hamburg when a selection team from the Danish Football Association defeated a selection team from the Hamburg-Altona Football Association, 5–0 in the presence of 5,000 spectators.

The first three editions of the Olympic football event in 1900–1906 had an unofficial status, as the event was not yet open for national football teams to compete, and only had limited participation of three or four club teams from a few nations. Denmark had no club team invited in the 1900 Olympics and the 1904 Olympics, but then received a special invitation for the unofficial 1906 Olympics, to compete against one Greek club team (Athens) and two club teams from the Ottoman Empire (Smyrna and Thessaloniki). The team to represent Denmark was compiled of players from the Copenhagen Football Association (KBU), and they won the event, and thereby an unofficial gold medal. Two years later, in the first official football tournament at the 1908 Olympics, Denmark won a silver medal. At the next Olympics, in 1912, the team again won a silver medal, which was followed by a golden era from July 1912 until August 1920, with Denmark ranked most of the time as number one in the world by the Elo ranking. The first official national football match was played on 19 October 1908 during the Olympic Games in London. Denmark beat France&#x27;s second team 9–0 in the tournament&#x27;s quarterfinals.

Although Denmark figured fairly prominently in the pre-FIFA World Cup era, international success would elude them for years from the first World Cup in 1930 and forward. Despite the country&#x27;s ability to produce outstanding football talents, the Danish Football Union (DBU) only had the ambition (or economy) to send the national team to play friendly matches and in the regional tournament, the Nordic Championship, from October 1920 until June 1948. When DBU opted to set their sights higher, they allowed the national team to start contesting the Olympics again, promptly resulting in a bronze medal at the 1948 Olympics. After, the team only reached the quarter-final at the 1952 Olympics, with the DBU choosing not to contest the next 1956 Olympics. As football remained an amateur past-time, most of the best Danish footballers moved abroad to make a living, and due to DBU enforcing the rule to bar all professionals from the national team, it started to become difficult to assemble a highly competitive team.

Denmark experienced their next revival at the 1960 Olympics with a third set of Olympic silver medals. This was followed by another notable performance at the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup, where Denmark impressively finished in fourth place. However, this finish was considered by many as being more the result of a comparatively easy draw rather than a result of a well-playing team. In order for Denmark to qualify for the semi-final, they only had to defeat Malta, Albania and Luxembourg. In the semi-final, Denmark fell 3–0 to the Soviet Union, then lost the third-place match to Hungary.

The strict rule of only allowing amateurism at the national team was finally abolished by the DBU in May 1971, as they had acknowledged this change was needed in order to build a highly competitive team. In February 1978, when the DBU also decided to allow professional football to be introduced in the Danish leagues, the way was at the same time paved for the national team to sign its first sponsorship with the well-known Danish brewery Carlsberg. The new sponsorship enabled the DBU to hire the German Sepp Piontek in July 1979 as the first full-time professional coach of the national team. The full transition of the national team from amateurism to professionalism had now been accomplished, and indeed, this would soon lead to a vast improvement in the performances of the team.

According to Rob Smyth and Lars Eriksen, authors of a book on the &quot;Danish Dynamite&quot; team that would soon emerge:
===Danish Dynamite (1980–1990)===
In the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification, Denmark finished with four wins and four losses, including a 3–1 win against the eventual World Cup champions Italy, but Denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament. Qualification for UEFA Euro 1984 saw Denmark defeat England at Wembley Stadium when Allan Simonsen converted a penalty kick for a 1–0 win. Denmark qualified for their first international tournament since 1964, and the team was dubbed &quot;Danish Dynamite&quot; in a competition for the official Danish Euro 1984 song. Denmark&#x27;s participation ended in the semi-final when the team lost on penalties to Spain, most remembered for Preben Elkjær&#x27;s penalty miss, his shorts torn apart. Following the strong performance at the finals, the name &quot;Danish Dynamite&quot; became a mainstay for the following decade of the Denmark national team under head coach Sepp Piontek.

Denmark made their first World Cup appearance in the 1986 World Cup, and with the attacking duo of Michael Laudrup and Preben Elkjær, thrashed Uruguay 6–1. In the second round, Denmark once again faced Spain and once more lost, 5–1, including four goals by Emilio Butragueño. The first Spanish goal was caused by a miss-timed backpass by Jesper Olsen to Butragueño, an unfortunate action subsequently coined as &quot;a real Jesper Olsen&quot; (&quot;en rigtig Jesper Olsen&quot;). The phrase would live on for 13 years, and was repeated by the Danish TV commentators in 1999, when an identical backpass was carried out by Jesper Grønkjær to Filippo Inzaghi in Grønkjær&#x27;s debut for the national team.

Denmark qualified for Euro 1988, and nearly made the 1988 Olympics. Richard Møller Nielsen guided Denmark to a secured spot for the final tournament – ahead of West Germany, but following the discovery that Dane Per Frimann was not eligible for the team&#x27;s 2–0 win over Poland, Denmark was penalised, and subsequently failed to qualify. At Euro 1988, Denmark&#x27;s participation ended in early defeat after Denmark lost all the group games to Spain 3–2, West Germany 2–0 and Italy 2–0. They then failed to qualify for the 1990 World Cup; Sepp Piontek resigned as head coach of the national team in April 1990, where he was replaced by Richard Møller Nielsen.

===The Møller Nielsen fairytale: 1992 European Championship===
Denmark began Euro 1992 qualification with a home victory against the Faroe Islands, and followed up with an away draw against Northern Ireland and a 2–0 home loss against Yugoslavia. Brothers Michael Laudrup and Brian Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990. When Nielsen subsequently decided to dismiss quality players such as Jan Mølby and Jan Heintze from the squad due to disciplinary problems, several newspapers began demanding that Nielsen step down as head coach. Despite this, Denmark won the rest of their five matches in the qualification group, including a 2–1 away win against Yugoslavia. This was not enough to qualify, as the team still had to settle for second place in the group, behind Yugoslavia.

Due to international sanctions resulting from the Yugoslav wars, UEFA announced on 31 May 1992 – only 10 days before the competition – that Yugoslavia was excluded from the competition and their place given to Denmark, who finished as the second-placed team in its qualifying group and ironically the best runner-up across all groups.

Contrary to popular belief, the team did not enter the tournament completely unprepared, after having rallied home from seaside vacations. The majority of players had been assembled to play a friendly match against the CIS when Denmark officially received Yugoslavia&#x27;s spot. Relying heavily on goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and his defense, as well as creative spark Brian Laudrup – having decided to make a comeback for the national team in April 1992 – the Danish team created one of the biggest surprises in the event&#x27;s history, as they went on to win the European Championship trophy under head coach Nielsen&#x27;s defensive playing style. Advancing from the group stage ahead of England and France, Denmark defeated the Netherlands – the defending Euro 1988 champions – on penalties in the semi-final. Later, in the final, Denmark won 2–0 win against reigning World Cup champions Germany, ensuring Denmark its first international trophy.

===Decline and revival (1993–2000)===
In August 1993, Michael Laudrup decided to settle his ongoing dispute with Richard Møller Nielsen about the team tactics and made a comeback to the national team. However, the following years Denmark saw mixed results, as they first failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, but then won the 1995 Confederations Cup (then known as King Fahd Cup), beating Copa América champions Argentina 2–0 in the final. As defending champions at Euro 1996, Denmark disappointed with a lackluster performance after an early elimination in the group stage. The team had achieved a respectable win against Turkey, a draw against Portugal and only a defeat to Croatia.

Nielsen&#x27;s replacement was Swede Bo &quot;Bosse&quot; Johansson, who gave the team a more offensive strategy, and the 1998 World Cup saw the revival of the Danish team, starring both Laudrup brothers in their last international campaign. After defeating Saudi Arabia 1–0, drawing with South Africa and losing 2–1 to eventual champions France, Denmark defeated Nigeria 4–1 in the round of 16. They exited in the quarterfinals with a 3–2 loss to Brazil.

Without the Laudrup brothers, Denmark qualified for Euro 2000, only to lose all three matches in the group stage.

===The Olsen Gang (2000–2015)===

Morten Olsen was named the new manager for Denmark in 2000 and the team was quickly dubbed the &quot;Olsen Gang&quot;, a reference to the series of Danish movies based around the main character Egon Olsen and his genius (criminal) plans. The nickname was also used for the Danish team as an alternative to the more commonly used &quot;Danish Dynamite&quot;, already in those days when Olsen played as a captain. Denmark&#x27;s tactics shifted from the preferred 4–4–2 formation practised by Bo Johansson to an even more attacking style with an emphasis on the wingers available at the time, namely Jesper Grønkjær and Dennis Rommedahl. Accordingly, Olsen&#x27;s preferred formation was either a 4–3–3 or a 4–2–3–1. Olsen even possessed an outspoken opposition to the 4–4–2 system, as he threatened to leave his position as head coach in the event he was asked to deploy Denmark in that formation. To support the development of players for the new tactical 4–3–3 system, all national youth teams also changed their formation. Another change Olsen brought to the national team was to stress the importance of only using fit players who had been granted regular playing time at their club. However, at times he was forced to compromise from this principle, as the pool of players available in the relatively small nation did not always provide him viable substitute options.

Denmark qualified both for the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004, but despite impressive results in the group stage in both tournaments, especially the 2–0 win against reigning World Cup winners France in 2002, Denmark failed to advance any further. At the 2002 World Cup, Denmark was defeated by England in the round of 16, and at Euro 2004, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals against the Czech Republic.

For the 2006 World Cup qualification, Denmark was paired with 2002 semi-finalists Turkey and eventual Euro 2004 champions Greece. Following a poor start to qualification, Denmark was trailing both Turkey and Ukraine. After failing to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, Morten Olsen considered leaving the job, having received several offers from club teams, but decided to stay and extended his contract until after the 2010 World Cup.

Denmark failed to qualify for Euro 2008, but qualified for the 2010 World Cup by winning their qualifying group, earning two wins against Sweden and four points against Portugal. Olsen&#x27;s contract was extended for two more years, until Euro 2012. At the 2010 World Cup, Denmark was grouped with Japan, Cameroon and the Netherlands. Denmark lost the first match 2–0 to the Netherlands, but then scored a 2–1 victory against Cameroon. The game against Japan, however ended with a 3–1 defeat.

In qualification for Euro 2012, Denmark was once again grouped with Portugal; Denmark secured first place in the group, qualifying directly for the final tournament. Out of eight qualifying matches, Denmark won six, drew one and lost one, resulting Olsen&#x27;s contract to be extended until after the 2014 World Cup.

At Euro 2012, Denmark were drawn in the proclaimed &quot;group of death&quot;, Group B, alongside Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal. After defeating the Netherlands 1–0, they lost 3–2 to Portugal, requiring a win against Germany to advance in the tournament. Despite Michael Krohn-Dehli&#x27;s equaliser, Denmark lost 2–1 to Germany, and with Portugal defeating the Netherlands 2–1, Denmark was eliminated from the tournament after finishing third in Group B.

Denmark failed to qualify for the next two tournaments under Olsen. They finished second in their 2014 World Cup qualifying group but failed to achieve a play-off berth as they were the worst UEFA group runners-up after removing results against the last-place teams. In Euro 2016 qualifying they finished third in their group, behind Albania and eventual winners Portugal, but lost to Sweden in the play-offs.

When measuring the performance of the national team by winning share and earned points, Olsen&#x27;s reign of the Denmark national team from July 2000 until January 2012 had at the time been the second-most successful in the era of full-time professional coaches, which began in July 1979. As of January 2012, Olsen had a winning share of 52.8%, and with three points for a victory and one for a draw, an average of 1.84 points per match. In comparison, Richard Møller Nielsen still had the best record among the professional coaches of the national team, with a 54.8% winning share and an average of 1.89 points per game.

===Hareide era: 2016–2020===
New coach Åge Hareide presided over the Danish campaign during the qualification stages. Denmark, ranked number 24 in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the draw, were drawn into Group E, alongside Poland, Montenegro, Romania, Armenia, and Kazakhstan.
Despite suffering early defeats to Poland and Montenegro, the Danes rallied, and secured second place in the group, and a berth in the play-offs, with a 1–0 away to Montenegro. Denmark were rewarded for their second-place finish with a play-off against the Republic of Ireland. Denmark secured qualification with a 5–1 win at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, which included a hat-trick by Christian Eriksen, who added to his tally of eight goals in qualification.

Denmark were allocated into Pot 3 in advance of the draw for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. They were drawn into Group C, alongside Australia, Peru, and France. Their campaign in Russia began in the Mordovia Arena, Saransk, against Peru. A Yussuf Poulsen goal in the second half secured three points for the Danes. However, they struggled against Australia in their second tie, as Christian Eriksen&#x27;s early goal was cancelled out by a VAR-awarded penalty, converted by Mile Jedinak, in a game that ended 1–1. Denmark secured qualification in their final group game, playing out the only goalless draw in the entire tournament,
in the Luzhniki Stadium against France; a result which saw both teams progress.

Denmark faced Croatia in the round of 16, with the Croats topping Group D with three wins. Mathias Jørgensen scored within the first minute of the game to give Denmark the lead, but Mario Mandzukic equalised only three minutes later, leaving the teams equally perched at one goal apiece. The match remained at 1–1 after ninety minutes, necessitating thirty minutes of extra-time, which still failed to separate the teams, as Luka Modrić saw his late penalty saved by goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. As such, the tie was to be decided with a penalty shoot-out, with Schmeichel and his Croatian counterpart, Danijel Subašić, positioning themselves on the line to face five penalties each. Croatia advanced, as Subašić saved three shots from Eriksen, Lasse Schöne and Nicolai Jørgensen respectively. Ivan Rakitić scored the decisive penalty to eliminate the Danes, putting an end to their best World Cup campaign since 2002.

Following the World Cup, Denmark prepared for participation in the inaugural iteration of the UEFA Nations League, having been drawn in League B against Wales and the Republic of Ireland. The tournament offers an alternative route of qualification for the European Championship and World Cup, and increases the number of competitive games for international sides, replacing friendlies.
Owing to a dispute with the players&#x27; union regarding the commercial rights of the players, the Danish Football Union named an entirely uncapped squad, consisting of a mixture of futsal players and players from the Danish 2nd Division and the Denmark Series (the third and fourth tier of Danish football respectively), in lieu of the regular side, to face Slovakia in a pre-Nations League friendly, and it was feared that the same squad would be used for the competitive fixture against Wales. The dispute arose due to the image rights of the players, with Hummel having the exclusive right to the manufacture and marketing of Danish kits. The DBU wanted to use individual players, without explicit permissions, in their advertising. Hareide would similarly not be involved, with the side instead falling under the temporary management of John Jensen, with Hasse Kuhn serving as the assistant manager. The Danish FA was under a four-year probationary period with UEFA for having forfeited a Women&#x27;s World Cup qualification game against Sweden in 2017 due to a similar dispute with the women&#x27;s team, and a further violation could have resulted in Denmark being prohibited from participation in either the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League or the 2020 European Championship. After a temporary agreement enabled the return of the regular players, the Danes won their first Nations League fixture 2–0.

Hareide managed Denmark during UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying and won four matches, drawing four more. This meant Denmark qualified for the tournament, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was postponed to 2021, and Hareide&#x27;s contract expired on 30 June 2020. He was replaced by Kasper Hjulmand.

===Hjulmand era: 2020–2024===
At UEFA Euro 2020, Denmark were beaten 1–0 by Finland; in a match marked by Christian Eriksen&#x27;s heart attack in the 42nd minute which led to the match being suspended for over two hours. In the following match, Denmark lost their second match to Belgium 2–1, despite initially taking the lead. They avoided elimination in the final round of matches with an impressive 4–1 victory against Russia. They therefore became the first team to qualify for the knockout phase of a European Championship despite two opening defeats. Facing Wales in the round of 16, Denmark won by a large margin (4–0) which earned them a quarter-final tie with the Czech Republic. Denmark won the tie 2–1 to progress to the next round. Their European Championship run ended with an extra time defeat to England in the semi-finals. Mikkel Damsgaard opened the scoring with a sublime free-kick on the half-hour mark before England equalised and subsequently won in extra time. Despite the elimination, Denmark&#x27;s performance was widely praised by the sporting press, in particular for its resilience in overcoming the difficult situation caused by Eriksen&#x27;s heart condition in the first group match, and for its high-quality teamwork and attacking play.

In the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League A, they finished second in their group, only one point behind Croatia and winning twice against world champions France. Denmark also qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, topping Group F in the qualification campaign ahead of Scotland, with nine victories, eight of which without conceding a goal.

At the 2022 World Cup, Denmark were drawn again with France, Tunisia and Australia in group D. They began their campaign with a goalless draw with Tunisia. In the second game, Denmark lost 2–1 to France after a brace from Kylian Mbappé. With a win essential, Denmark were unable to defeat Australia and were therefore eliminated; finishing bottom of their group.

The UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers were also a tough affair for Denmark, seeded first in the draw but struggling in most of their matches, including a humiliating 3–2 defeat in Kazakhstan after leading 2–0. Nevertheless, the Danish team managed to finish top of their group with 7 wins, 1 draw and 2 defeats, and qualified for their 10th continental finals. At UEFA Euro 2024, Denmark qualified as runners-up in their group but were eliminated by Germany in the round of 16. Following the tournament, Hjulmand resigned on 19 July 2024, and his assistant Morten Wieghorst was named as the new manager on a short-term contract until the end of 2024.

==Team image==

===Supporters===

Apart from the national team, Denmark is famous for its traveling fans, known as &quot;roligans&quot;. The movement emerged during the 1980s as the declared opposition to hooliganism. The goal of the roligan movement is calm, yet cheerful, support during the matches, as &quot;rolig&quot; means &quot;calm&quot; in the Danish language. The &quot;roligans&quot; have since developed an image of easy-going nature and rabid support, and are often considered amongst the world&#x27;s best national team fans, along with the Tartan Army of Scotland. They were collectively given the FIFA FairPlay Award at the 1984 European Championships. The term &quot;roligan&quot; was invented by the editors of the Danish newspaper &quot;B.T.&quot; in 1985, and later included in the Danish dictionary. Just before the 1986 World Cup, the roligan movement was organized in order to support the national team at the tournament.

The reputation of the Danish supporters was sullied by an attack from a fan which occurred in June 2007 in the Euro 2008 qualifying match against Sweden, when an enraged Danish supporter invaded the pitch and tried to attack the referee, following his decision to hand out a red card for Christian Poulsen and a penalty kick to Sweden in the last minute of the match. The attacking fan was stopped by some of the Danish football players on the field before he reached the referee, but due to the episode, the match was immediately cancelled by the referee, with UEFA subsequently deciding to award a 3–0 default defeat to Denmark as punishment.

===Rivalry===

Denmark&#x27;s main rival is Sweden. The countries have played against each other 107 times, of which Denmark have won 40, drawn 20 and lost 47. The first match between the teams was an 8–0 Denmark win in May 1913. Denmark won their first five matches against Sweden before their first defeat in October 1916, 4–0.

The first competitive match between the countries was a 1–0 loss for Denmark in the group stage of UEFA Euro 1992. Both teams advanced from the group stage and Denmark went on to win the tournament. In UEFA Euro 2004 the teams drew 2–2 in the last group match, ensuring that both teams advanced at the expense of Italy. In Denmark&#x27;s home match against Sweden in the qualification for UEFA Euro 2008, the visitors were awarded a 3–0 win after a Danish fan invaded the pitch and attacked the referee. The reverse fixture ended in a goalless draw and Denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament.

In the qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Denmark won both matches against Sweden 1–0 and qualified for the World Cup. In the play-off round of the qualification for UEFA Euro 2016, Denmark lost to Sweden 4–3 on aggregate and failed to qualify for the finals. The most recent match between the countries was a 2–1 win for Denmark in June 2024.

===Kit===

The team kit is produced by Danish company Hummel. It is all-red with white details to reflect the colours of the Danish national flag. Prior to the period of Adidas sponsorship, the kit provider was also Hummel from 1979 to 2004.
===Broadcast===
All of Denmark&#x27;s qualification, Nations League and friendly matches are broadcast by TV 2 on television. DR holds the rights on radio transmission.

==Home stadium==
The first home match for the Denmark national team was a 2–1 friendly win over England on 25 May 1910, taking place with 12,000 spectators at the stadium &quot;KBs baner&quot; (located in the area &quot;Granen&quot;, where the Forum Copenhagen later was built). As the facilities were considered too small, a new stadium in Copenhagen was built with the name Idrætsparken. Since its opening on 25 May 1911, it has hosted all the home matches of the football club KB and most of the home matches of the national team. During the first 82 years of the national team, from October 1908 until November 1990, Denmark played a total number of 254 A-level home matches, of which 232 were played in Idrætsparken. Among all the played home matches in Idrætsparken, Denmark achieved 125 victories (54%), 41 draws (18%) and 66 defeats (28%). The stadium reached a record of 51,600 spectators for the 1–2 game against Sweden in June 1957.

In regards of the first era from 1908 to 1990, only 22 home matches were played at other stadiums than Idrætsparken, of which 11 took place at Aarhus Idrætspark (then known as Atletion) in Aarhus, followed by Aalborg Stadion in Aalborg with six games, and the remaining five matches hosted by four other stadiums. Whenever another stadium than Idrætsparken was used for a home match, it was only for some of the less important friendly games or Olympic qualifiers, while only Idrætsparken was used to host the matches related to bigger tournaments, like the Nordic championship, the European Championship and World Cup. When a major rebuild of Idrætsparken began in December 1990, the subsequent two official Euro 1992 qualification matches were moved to Odense Stadium in Odense.

On 9 September 1992, the rebuilt Idrætsparken, now called Parken and later renamed Telia Parken for sponsorship reasons, became the biggest venue in Denmark with a capacity of 42,358 spectators, and was opened with a friendly 1–2 defeat against Germany. This first match in Parken was viewed by 40,500 spectators, while the current stadium record of 42,099 spectators was set on 8 October 2005 for a World Cup qualifying match against Greece.

The capacity of the stadium was later reduced to 38,009 seats after the upper part of the D-side was converted from 4,000 extra seats into office and VIP areas in June 2009. Despite this decrease in capacity, the stadium is today still the biggest venue in Denmark by far; the next largest venue, Brøndby Stadium, only has a capacity of 26,000 seats. From September 1992 to May 2006, Parken was the sole stadium of all the men&#x27;s senior national team matches. However, meagre spectator support at some of the friendly matches at Parken, which from 2000 to 2005 attracted an acceptable average of 23,862 per match – but down to 9,598 for the friendly 3–1 win over Israel in April 2002 – prompted the DBU to start hosting many of the friendly matches to other stadiums around Denmark. These other stadiums had less spectator capacity than Parken, but just about enough to cover the Danes&#x27; somewhat lesser interest for friendly matches.

On 27 May 2006, Parken&#x27;s 13-year monopoly on national team matches was broken for the first time when Denmark played a friendly match at the Aarhus Idrætspark against upcoming 2006 World Cup participants Paraguay. Tickets to this match were sold out quickly, with almost 19,000 of the 20,227 tickets sold within the first hour of sale, and was support-wise a big success with a total audience of 20,047 spectators. When the two next friendly matches were played at other new venues, such as a match on 16 August at Fionia Park in Odense against Poland, and on 1 September at Brøndby Stadium against Portugal, the number of spectators dropped. The Poland match attracted only 11,088 spectators, while the Portugal match had only 13,186 fans. In particular, the Portugal match was deemed as a support-wise failure because it featured a higher-ranked opponent, which spectators normally would have a high interest to watch. The main reasons why Brøndby Stadium failed to attract a high number of spectators were generally thought to be a combination of the poor rainy weather and the fact the stadium is located on the outskirts of Copenhagen, and as such does not attract a new demographic audience compared to Parken, due to the travel distances being more or less the same for the majority of the population.

Currently, while most of the friendly matches continue to be played at some of the smaller stadiums in Denmark, it has been decided to continue playing all of the qualifying matches for the European Championships and World Cup only at Parken Stadium. Those friendly matches, which are believed to create a high interest from spectators, will also continue to be played at Parken. For example, the friendly against Germany in August 2010 was played at Parken Stadium due to the high expectation of spectators desiring to watch the match. However, after Denmark&#x27;s performance at the 2010 World Cup, the friendly only drew 19,071 spectators. From September 1992 to January 2012, Denmark played a total of 77 A-level matches at Parken Stadium, of which 49 were won, 16 were drawn and 12 lost.

===Managers===

The responsibility and job description for the manager of the Denmark national football team has changed throughout the history. From 1908 to 1918, the DBU preferred to assign a manager with the overall responsibility. This was followed by a long era from 1919 to 1956 where either no manager or only a caretaker manager was assigned. When the DBU assigned Arne Sørensen (November 1956 – December 1961) and Poul Petersen (January 1962 –December 1966) as managers for a rolling period of several years, they were given the responsibility to coach the physical training and decide the team tactics before and during each match, but had no influence upon the selection of players for the national squad, which was a job for the specially-appointed selection committee, the &quot;UdtagelsesKomitéen&quot;.

From 1967 to 1969, the management of the team more or less became a sole responsibility for the &quot;UdtagelsesKomitéen&quot;, following a new approach. In this new approach, the job to select players continued to be the responsibility for the &quot;UdtagelsesKomitéen&quot;, but the chairman of the committee was now also appointed to be the &quot;tactical manager&quot; of the national team, as the DBU realized the need of having a special tactical manager assigned to get influence upon both the selection of players and the related tactics before and during the game. However, the appointed tactical manager did not have the responsibility to train the squad, as a special physical coach was instead selected for that job. In 1970, the approach with two managers assigned was again abandoned when the DBU realized the need to assign only one manager with the sole responsibility for the squad.

From 1970 to 1979, the job to select players was not yet a sole responsibility of the manager alone, but only a shared responsibility, as this continued to be a matter for the &quot;UdtagelsesKomitéen&quot; to decide. When a selection of players had to be made, it was decided by a vote in the committee, with the appointed manager being granted an influence of three votes and the four members of the committee being granted one vote each. This special selection procedure continued until July 1979, where it was decided to award the sole responsibility of all manager-related areas to the manager himself, with the assignment of Sepp Piontek as the first full-time professional manager of the national team.

===Player history===
The players are freely chosen by the national team manager. They are normally assembled from their respective club teams at the Hotel Marienlyst in Elsinore for a week-long training camp preluding the upcoming match. Friendly matches are typically played on a Wednesday evening. World Cup qualifiers are played on both Saturday and Wednesday evenings, while Euro qualifiers now take place on both a Friday and Tuesday evening when playing two matches in a row, or on a Friday/Saturday/Tuesday at rounds with only one match scheduled.

===Best players of all time===
In November 2006, the DBU nominated eight Denmark national team footballers for the &quot;Best Danish Footballer of All Time&quot; award. The nominated players were Morten Olsen, Henning Jensen, Allan Simonsen, Preben Elkjær, Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup, Peter Schmeichel and Jon Dahl Tomasson. The winner of the award was decided by a public vote arranged by the broadcasting channel TV2, which ended with Michael Laudrup as a clear winner, with 58% of the votes.

===Hall of Fame===
Denmark&#x27;s Hall of Fame was established in October 2008, as a special award to celebrate the best footballers, teams and coaches; throughout the history of the national team. A jury with six people (representing the newspapers, authors of football books, active players of the national team, TV2, the DBU, and a Hall of Fame member), each year has the job to award one or two new members for the Hall of Fame. The award is handed out at the official Danish Football Awards, which is a yearly television broadcast event – organized by the DBU in November throughout 2008 to 2013 and subsequently moved to a later date in February. Besides receiving the award, all Hall of Fame members are also invited to leave a footprint in bronze, to decorate the entrance hall at &quot;Fodboldens hus&quot; -the DBU headquarters in Brøndby. When the DBU celebrated its 125-year anniversary in May 2014, it decided to make an extraordinary award of nine additional Hall of Fame Members, all playing during the first half of the DBU national team&#x27;s existence, from 1908 to 1964. Because of financial restraints, the DBU cancelled the planned televised broadcast of the Football Award in February 2015, and for the same reason opted not to award any new Hall of Fame members in this specific year. The DBU expected to return awarding new Hall of Fame members again, when the next broadcast Football Award event was organized in February 2016.

===Payment===
Each national team player receives a set amount of money per match, including bonuses for a win and qualification for European Championship and World Cup tournaments. Throughout the years, the prize money has gone from around €1,340 for a match win in 1987 and around €26,800 for the Euro 1988 participation alone, to around €67,000 for the 1998 World Cup, and up to €107,000 for the 2002 World Cup, per player.

Currently, the payments for participation in games outside the big tournaments are regulated by a collective agreement – to be renegotiated after a certain number of years – while all payments for participation of players in a final tournament squad are regulated by the &quot;1998 agreement&quot; between the DBU and &quot;Spillerforeningen&quot;. The &quot;1998 agreement&quot; stipulates that whenever the national team qualifies for a World Cup or European Championship tournament, the selected players for the final tournament shall receive 50% of the DBU&#x27;s revenues from the event, and 65% of the DBU&#x27;s revenues from the sale of merchandise and license agreements. Additionally, the sponsors of the national team also pay a relatively high &quot;qualification bonus&quot; each time the team qualifies for a final tournament. This bonus is shared between the group of players being selected for the final 18-man squad, to one or several of the qualification matches played, with the exact distribution normally decided according to the number of times the player was selected.

Each of the 23 selected players for the 2002 World Cup received DKK 498,000 (equal to €66,800) from the event revenues, plus DKK 122,900 (equal to €16,500) from the sale of merchandise and license agreements, plus an unknown qualification bonus from the sponsors, plus the standard payment from the DBU each time they were selected for the final 18-man squad to a qualification match. In comparison, each of the 23 selected players for the 2010 World Cup received DKK 635,000 (equal to €85,100) from the event revenues, plus DKK 98,900 (equal to €13,200) from the sale of merchandise and license agreements, plus a qualification bonus from the sponsors at DKK 2,800,000 (equal to €375,000) to be shared between the players – corresponding to an amount of €2,080 per time the player was selected for the final 18-man squad to a qualification match. In addition to the qualification bonus, the players also received this standard payment from the DBU each time they were selected for the 18-man squad to a qualification match:

* Starting fee: home games = DKK 1,2 per spectator, away games = DKK 8,290
* Bonus for a draw: home games = DKK 0, away games = DKK 9,475
* Bonus for a win: home games = DKK 17,765, away games = DKK 29,600

Based on Denmark&#x27;s results and number of spectators at home matches, the standard qualification match payment to a player selected for all of Denmark&#x27;s qualification matches equals a total amount of DKK 235,898 (or €31,600) for the six qualification matches in the 2008–09 season, and a total amount of DKK 170,788 (or €22,900) for the four qualification matches in the 2009–10 season. Finally, the players could also add a seasonal payment named &quot;regular bonus&quot; from the sponsors, with a total of DKK 4,350,000 (equal to €583,100) to be shared each season by the squad of 18 players selected for a match, meaning a player who was selected for all national team matches from 1 August to 31 July would receive an additional DKK 241,700 (equal to €32,400) payment in both the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons.

The last amount of a players income generated by the national team is the standard payment received for each friendly match:
* Starting fee: home games = DKK 1,0 per spectator, away games = DKK 5,000
* Bonus for a draw: home games = DKK 0, away games = DKK 0
* Bonus for a win: home games = DKK 10,000, away games = DKK 10,000

Based on Denmark&#x27;s results and number of spectators at home matches, the standard payment to a player selected for all Denmark&#x27;s friendly matches equals a total amount of DKK 41,426 (or €5,500) for the three friendly matches in the 2008–09 season, and a total amount of DKK 88,773 (or €11,900) for the seven friendly matches in the 2009–10 season.

When all these payments are added together for a player, under the assumption a player was selected for all matches in each season as well as the final 2010 World Cup squad, he would have received a total payment from the DBU of €69,500 in the 2008–09 season and a total payment from the DBU of €186,300 in the 2009–10 season.

She won a BAFTA Best Actress Award for the role of Edith Hope in the 1986 TV adaptation of Anita Brookner&#x27;s novel &quot;Hotel du Lac&quot;, a role that one of her co-stars, Julia McKenzie, has said &quot;could have been written for her&quot;. Massey is also well known for her role in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972) as a barmaid who becomes involved with a suspected killer. She performed over one hundred character roles in British film and television. On the stage, in 1982, Massey won the Laurence Olivier Award for Actress of the Year in a Supporting Role for &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and was nominated for the Award for Actress of the Year in a New Play for &quot;Summer&quot;.

==Early life==
Massey was born in Thakeham, Sussex, England, the daughter of British actress Adrianne Allen and Canadian-born Hollywood actor Raymond Massey. Her parents divorced when she was an infant and she continued to live in England with her mother. Her older brother Daniel Massey also became an actor. She was the niece of Vincent Massey, a Governor General of Canada, and her godfather was film director John Ford.

==Career==
Although she had no formal training at either drama school or in repertory, Anna Massey made her first appearance on stage in May 1955 at the age of 17, at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, as Jane in &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot;, subsequently making her first London appearance in the same play at the Cambridge Theatre in May 1955 &quot;and was suddenly famous&quot;. She then left the cast in London to repeat her performance in New York in October 1956. In the 1990s she appeared with Alan Bennett in a dramatised reading of T.S. Eliot&#x27;s and Virginia Woolf&#x27;s letters, in a production at the Charleston Festival devised by Patrick Garland.

Several of her early film roles were in mystery thrillers. She made her cinema debut in the Scotland Yard film &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Day&quot; (1958) as Sally, daughter of Jack Hawkins&#x27;s Detective Inspector. The director was her godfather John Ford. She played a potential murder victim in Michael Powell&#x27;s cult thriller &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960) and appeared in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Bunny Lake Is Missing&quot; (1965). In 1972 she played the role of the barmaid Babs in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s penultimate film &quot;Frenzy&quot;. In the documentary on the film&#x27;s DVD release, Massey mentioned that she originally auditioned for the much smaller role of the secretary Monica, a part for which Jean Marsh was cast. She also noted that her character&#x27;s nude scenes in &quot;Frenzy&quot; were performed by body doubles. She appeared alongside her brother Daniel—they played siblings—in the horror film &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; (1973).

Massey continued to make occasional film and stage appearances, but worked more frequently in television. She made her first small-screen appearance as Jacqueline in &quot;Green of the Year&quot; in October 1955, and thereafter featured in dramas such as &quot;The Pallisers&quot; (1974), &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; (1978), the 1979 adaptation of &quot;Rebecca&quot; (in which she starred with her ex-husband Jeremy Brett), &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; (1980), and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1985). She had roles in the British comedy series &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Robinsons&quot; (2005). She also appeared in a number of mysteries and thrillers on television, including episodes of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, &quot;The Inspector Alleyn Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;Strange&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot;, and &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;.

With Imelda Staunton, she co-devised and starred as Josephine Daunt in &quot;Daunt and Dervish&quot; on BBC radio. She was the narrator of &quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot; on BBC Radio 4, a history of Britain from Roman times which ran for more than 300 fifteen-minute episodes. In 2009, she also appeared in a new radio version of &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot;.

In 1987, Massey was awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Actress for her role in &quot;Hotel du Lac&quot; after acquiring the TV rights two years earlier, only a few weeks before the novel won the Booker Prize. She also appeared as Mrs D&#x27;Urberville in the 2008 BBC adaptation of &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;.

==Acting style==
One of Massey&#x27;s assets as an actress was her &quot;extraordinary voice... it was so listenable&quot;. Although Massey&#x27;s parts were varied, her &quot;cut-glass English accent conveyed a cold and repressed character on screen&quot;. Michael Billington of &quot;The Guardian&quot; characterised her work as being informed by &quot;stillness&quot;, such as in the National Theatre&#x27;s production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;A Kind of Alaska&quot;. Massey was the principal narrator of the BBC Radio series on British history &quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot;. She also recorded several audiobooks, including Daphne Du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot;. 

She was known for a high level of preparation and effort, with one producer saying that she had a practice of using five different coloured pens on scripts to mark out &quot;breaths and pauses&quot; and the development of a scene; for example, &quot;if a phrase early in a paragraph was going to be picked up again later, she would highlight those two bits in the same colour, so that it would remind her that that first phrase was referring to something later&quot;.

==Personal life==
In the New Year&#x27;s Honours List published on 31 December 2004, she was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to drama.

Massey published an autobiography in 2006, &quot;Telling Some Tales&quot;, in which she revealed a difficult early life, including a distant relationship with her famous father and estrangement with her brother. She described her failed marriage (1958–1962) to actor Jeremy Brett, discussing his struggle with bipolar disorder. Brett and Massey divorced on 22 November 1962 after she claimed he left her for a man. The couple had one son, writer and illustrator David Huggins (b. 1959). At an August 1988 dinner party held at the home of their mutual friend, Joy Whitby, she met Russian-born metallurgist Uri Andres, who had been based at Imperial College, London since 1975. The couple were married from November 1988 until her death in 2011.

Massey was quoted as saying, &quot;Theatre eats up too much of your family life. I have a grandson and a husband and I&#x27;d rather I was able to be a granny and a wife.&quot;

She died from lung cancer in Kensington, London on 3 July 2011, aged 73.

<doc id="580192" wikidata="Q17528596" url="?curid=580192" title="Wollaton Hall">
<text>Wollaton Hall is an Elizabethan country house of the 1580s standing on a small but prominent hill in Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England. The house is now Nottingham Natural History Museum, with Nottingham Industrial Museum in the outbuildings. The surrounding parkland has a herd of deer, and is regularly used for large-scale outdoor events such as rock concerts, sporting events and festivals.

==Wollaton and the Willoughbys==
Wollaton Hall was built between 1580 and 1588 for Sir Francis Willoughby and is believed to be designed by the Elizabethan architect, Robert Smythson, who had by then completed Longleat, and was to go on to design Hardwick Hall. The general plan of Wollaton is comparable to these, and was widely adopted for other houses, but the exuberant decoration of Wollaton is distinctive, and it is possible that Willoughby played some part in creating it. The style is an advanced Elizabethan with early Jacobean elements.

Wollaton is a classic prodigy house, &quot;the architectural sensation of its age&quot;, though its builder was not a leading courtier and its construction stretched the resources he mainly obtained from coalmining; the original family home was at the bottom of the hill. Though much re-modelled inside, the &quot;startlingly bold&quot; exterior remains largely intact.

On 21 June 1603, Willoughby&#x27;s son Sir Percival Willoughby hosted Anne of Denmark and her children Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth at Wollaton. Charles, later Charles I, came in 1604.

==Description==
The building consists of a central block dominated by a hall three storeys high, with a stone screen at one end and galleries at either end, with the &quot;Prospect Room&quot; above that. From this there are extensive views of the park and surrounding country. There are towers at each corner, projecting out from this top floor. At each corner of the house is a square pavilion of three storeys, with decorative features rising above the roof line. Much of the basement storey is cut from the rock the house sits on.

The floor plan has been said to derive from Serlio&#x27;s drawing (in Book III of his &quot;Five Books of Architecture&quot;) of Giuliano da Majano&#x27;s Villa Poggio Reale near Naples of the late 15th century, with elevations derived from Hans Vredeman de Vries. The architectural historian Mark Girouard has suggested that the design is in fact derived from Nikolaus de Lyra&#x27;s reconstruction, and Josephus&#x27;s description, of Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem, with a more direct inspiration being the mid-16th century Mount Edgcumbe in Cornwall, which Smythson knew. 

The building is of Ancaster stone from Lincolnshire, and is said to have been paid for with coal from the Wollaton pits owned by Willoughby; the labourers were also paid this way. Cassandra Willoughby, Duchess of Chandos recorded in 1702 that the master masons, and some of the statuary, were brought from Italy. The decorative gondola mooring rings carved in stone on the exterior walls offer some evidence of this, as do other architectural features. There are also obvious French and Dutch influences. The exterior and hall have extensive and busy carved decoration, featuring strapwork and a profusion of decorative forms. 
The window tracery of the upper floors in the central block and the general busyness of the decoration look back to the Middle Ages, and have been described as &quot;fantasy-Gothic&quot;.

==Later history==

The house was unused for about four decades before 1687, following a fire in 1642, and then re-occupied and given the first of several campaigns of re-modelling of the interiors. Paintings on the ceilings of the two main staircases and round the walls of one are attributed to Sir James Thornhill and perhaps also Louis Laguerre, carried out around 1700. Re-modelling was carried out by Wyatville in 1801 and continued intermittently until the 1830s.The hall remains essentially in its original Elizabethan state, with a &quot;fake hammerbeam&quot; wood ceiling of the 1580s, in fact supported by horizontal beams above, but given large and un-needed hammerbeams for decoration. The slightly earlier roofs of the great halls at Theobalds and Longleat were similar.

The gallery of the main hall contains Nottinghamshire&#x27;s oldest pipe organ, thought to date from the end of the 17th century, possibly by the builder Gerard Smith. It is still blown by hand. Beneath the hall are many cellars and passages, and a well and associated reservoir tank, in which some accounts report that an admiral of the Willoughby family took a daily bath.

The Willoughbys were noted for the number of explorers they produced, most famously Sir Hugh Willoughby who died in the Arctic in 1554 attempting a North East passage to Cathay. Willoughby&#x27;s Land is named after him.
In 1881, the house was still owned by the head of the Willoughby family, Digby Willoughby, 9th Baron Middleton, but by then it was &quot;too near the smoke and busy activity of a large manufacturing town... now only removed from the borough by a narrow slip of country&quot;, so that the previous head of the family, Henry Willoughby, 8th Baron Middleton, had begun to let the house to tenants and in 1881 it was vacant.

The hall was bought by Nottingham Council in 1925. 
Estate and personal papers of the Willoughby family were used to create the Middleton collection at the department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham. They include the Wollaton Antiphonal and the single manuscript holding the 13th-century post-Arthurian romance .

Nottingham Council opened the hall as a museum in 1926. In 2005 it was closed for a two-year refurbishment and re-opened in April 2007. The prospect room at the top of the house, and the kitchens in the basement, were opened up for the public to visit, though this must be done on one of the escorted tours. The latter can be booked on the day, lasts about an hour, and a small charge is made.

In 2011, key scenes from the Batman movie &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; were filmed outside Wollaton Hall. The Hall was featured as Wayne Manor. The Hall is five miles north of Gotham, Nottinghamshire, through which Gotham City indirectly got its name.

==Gardens==
Wollaton Hall Park is Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

The Camellia House is a listed building in its own right, as are many other buildings and structures, including a doric temple and Ha-Ha.

==Similar buildings==
In 1855, Joseph Paxton designed Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire, which borrows many features from Wollaton. Both properties have been used as film locations for Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Batman trilogy of films, featuring as Wayne Manor – the latter in &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and Wollaton Hall itself in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;.

==Nottingham Natural History Museum==
Since Wollaton Hall opened to the public in 1926, it has been home to the city&#x27;s natural history museum. 
On display are some of the items from the three quarters of a million specimens that make up its zoology, geology, and botany collections. These are housed in six main galleries:
* Natural Connections Gallery
* Bird Gallery
* Insect Gallery
* Mineral Gallery
* Africa Gallery
* Natural History Matters Gallery

The Museum started life as an interest group at the Nottingham Mechanics&#x27; Institution; it is now owned by the Nottingham City Council.

In 2017 the museum hosted a tour of dinosaur skeletons titled &quot;Dinosaurs of China, Ground Shakers to Feathered Flyers&quot;. The exhibition was attended by over 125,000 people. 

From July 2021 to August 2022, the Nottingham Natural History Museum featured the world&#x27;s first exhibit of Titus, a &quot;real&quot; &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; fossil which was discovered in Montana, in the United States, in 2014.

<doc id="580197" wikidata="Q108749718" url="?curid=580197" title="PROIV">
<text>PROIV (pronounced &quot;pro-four&quot;), also known as &#x27;Pro-IV&#x27;, is a low code development platform owned by Zellis Holdings, a British HR services company.

PROIV was originally developed as a fourth-generation programming language (4GLs). PROIV and other 4GL are aiming to simplify and reduce efforts to create and develop computer programs compared to third-generation programming languages (3GLs) such as Cobol and Fortran.

PROIV&#x27;s usual application domain is database-centric business applications.

PROIV programs consist of declarative/non-procedural specifications that control the overall structure of the program and database access and that have an implicit sequence of execution (which PROIV programmers refer to as the timing cycle). Procedural subroutines can be added by the programmer; these are written in a 3GL-like language, which PROIV calls &quot;Logic&quot;.

== History ==
PROIV was developed by Sushil K. Garg, working in Hawaii in 1976 on a General Automation System. In the early 1980s, it was licensed to McDonnell Information Systems (MDIS).

MDIS converted PROIV to run on their Pick-based systems, and this spin-off was known as ALL (Application Language Liberator).

PROIV was ported to several different platforms by separate teams. Garg brought these ports together as one company, Pro Computer Sciences (PCS), headquartered in Laguna Hills, California. PCS was subsequently acquired by MDIS in 1988.

During the second half of the 1980s, a PROIV team entered the 4GL Grand Prix contests in1987, 1988, and 1990 and the product finished second on each occasion.

In 2000, McDonnell Information Systems changed its name to Northgate Information Solutions.

== Implementation ==
PROIV runs OS-independent application code in an OS-specific virtual machine, allowing a user application to run unaltered on different computing platforms. , Zellis claims support for PROIV on Microsoft Windows (workstation and server), Red Hat Linux, IBM AIX, and Oracle Solaris; with Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and IBM C-ISAM as the database backend.

The PROIV-supplied &quot;GUI client&quot;, which renders the rich-client UI for applications written in PROIV, is based around ActiveX technology and works only on Windows client platforms. Consequently, the programmers&#x27; development environments supplied with more-recent PROIV releases also work only on a Windows client platform.

== Major applications ==
*In the United Kingdom it was used in the London congestion charge system.

<doc id="580201" wikidata="Q7885088" url="?curid=580201" title="Uniform Time Act">
<text>The Uniform Time Act of 1966, , was a Law of the United States to &quot;promote the adoption and observance of uniform time within the standard time zones&quot; prescribed by the Standard Time Act of 1918. Its intended effect was to simplify the official pattern of where and when daylight saving time (DST) is applied within the U.S. Prior to this law, each state had its own scheme for when DST would begin and end, and in some cases, which parts of the state should use it.

==History==
The law, as originally written, required states that observe DST to begin it at 2 a.m. local time on the last Sunday in April, and to end it at 2 a.m. local time on the last Sunday in October and explicitly preempted all state laws related to daylight saving time per the weights and measures power given to Congress in Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. In 1972, the act was amended to allow states with more than one timezone to exempt only one timezone from DST, in addition to exempting the whole state. The law was later amended again in 1986 to move the uniform start date for DST to the first Sunday in April (effective 1987). The latest amendment, part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, extends DST by four or five weeks by moving the uniform start date for DST to the second Sunday in March and the end date to the first Sunday in November (effective 2007). The Department of Energy was required to report to Congress the impact of the DST extension by December 1, 2007 (nine months after the statute took effect). The report, released in October 2008, reported a nationwide electricity savings of 0.03% for the year of 2007.

===Specifications===
The law does not require that all states observe DST. Individual states may exempt themselves from DST and observe standard time year-round by passing a state law, provided:
* if the state lies entirely within a time zone, that the exemption apply statewide, or
* if the state is divided by a time zone boundary, that the exemption apply statewide or to the entire part of the state on one side of the boundary.

==Non-observers==

The state of Hawaii has never observed daylight saving, even during World War II when &quot;War Time&quot; was observed by other states as an energy saving measure. 

The territories of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands also do not observe Daylight Saving Time.

Observance of daylight saving varied by county in Indiana, which is divided by the Eastern/Central time zone boundary, until April 2, 2006, when the entire state once again observed DST, a first since Congress repealed the Standard Time Act of 1918.

Arizona has not observed daylight saving since the year following the enactment of the Uniform Time Act of 1966. Native American nations within Arizona may choose. The Navajo Nation has chosen to use daylight saving throughout its territory, which includes parts of New Mexico and Utah where daylight saving is observed. The Hopi Nation, with territory surrounded entirely by the Arizona portion of the Navajo Nation, has chosen not to observe daylight saving.

<doc id="580206" wikidata="Q1414901" url="?curid=580206" title="Kalos kagathos">
<text>Kalos kagathos or kalokagathos ( ), of which &quot;&quot; () is the derived noun, is a phrase used by classical Greek writers to describe an ideal of gentlemanly , especially in a military context.

Its use is attested since Herodotus and the classical period. The phrase is adjectival, composed of two adjectives, (&quot;beautiful&quot;) and (&quot;good&quot; or &quot;virtuous&quot;), the second of which is combined by crasis with &quot;and&quot; to form .

Werner Jaeger summarizes it as &quot;the chivalrous ideal of the complete human personality, harmonious in mind and body, foursquare in battle and speech, song and action&quot;.

== Uses ==
The word was a term used in Greek when discussing the concept of aristocracy. It became a fixed phrase by which the Athenian aristocracy referred to itself; in the ethical philosophers, the first of whom were Athenian gentlemen, the term came to mean the ideal or perfect man.

The phrase could be used both in a generic sense, or with certain specific force. As a generic term, it may have been used as the combination of distinct virtues, which we might translate as &quot;handsome and brave&quot;, or the intersection of the two words &quot;good&quot; or &quot;upstanding&quot;. Translations such as &quot;gentleman&quot; or &quot;knight&quot; have traditionally been suggested to convey the social aspect of the phrase, while &quot;war hero&quot; or the more cynical &quot;martyr&quot; are more recent versions, and emphasise the military element.

Its recorded usage dates from the second half of the 5th and in the 4th century B.C.. For example, in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Lysis&quot;, a young man is described as &quot;imbued with kalokagathia&quot;.

There is thematic discussion of &quot;kalokagathia&quot; in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;, Book VIII, chapter 3 (1248b). And how a &quot;kalos kagathos&quot; (gentleman) should live is also discussed at length in Xenophon&#x27;s Socratic dialogues, especially the &quot;Oeconomicus&quot;.

In Aristotle, the term becomes important as a technical term used in discussions about Ethics.

== Kalos ==
The adjective means beautiful and encompasses meanings equivalent to English &quot;good&quot;, &quot;noble&quot;, and &quot;handsome&quot;. The form given by convention is the masculine, but it was equally used of women (the feminine form is ) and could also describe animals or inanimate objects.

Plato, in his work &quot;Republic&quot;, used the term (the neutral form) in his attempts to define ideals. However, his protagonist in the dialogue, Socrates, states that he did not fully comprehend the nature of this .

== Agathos ==
This second adjective means &quot;good&quot; in a broad and general sense, and had no particular physical or aesthetic connotations, but could describe a person&#x27;s excellence of character (ethical virtue), for example their bravery. In the 4th century, it often carried implications of dutiful citizenship.

== Related terms ==
Plato coined the term &quot;Agathos kai sophos&quot; () which literally means &quot;good and wise&quot; in Greek, to avoid association with the belief that external beauty (kalos) was associated with inner beauty, morality and virtue. 

In Aristotle&#x27;s ethical works such as the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; and &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;, the term &quot;megalopsuchia&quot; (&quot;greatness of soul&quot;, magnanimity) has been interpreted as being &quot;large scale kalokagathia&quot; by the scholar Jennifer Whiting (1998). Her interpretation is dependent upon the interpretation that for Aristotle, both kalokagathia and megalopsuchia, are not, in their true forms, virtues that come about only because people want to be honoured for doing good things.

The possession of the beautiful and the good has a correspondent in Latin: (&quot;a healthy soul in a healthy body&quot;). It is also seen as a target in balanced education of body and spirit.

<doc id="580209" wikidata="Q366775" url="?curid=580209" title="Jeff Ament">
<text>Jeffrey Allen Ament (born March 10, 1963) is an American musician best known as the bassist of rock band Pearl Jam, which he co-founded alongside Stone Gossard, Mike McCready, and Eddie Vedder. Ament wrote or co-wrote many of Pearl Jam&#x27;s hits, including &quot;Jeremy&quot;, &quot;Oceans&quot;, &quot;Dissident&quot;, &quot;Nothingman&quot; and &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot;.

Prior to his work with Pearl Jam, Ament was part of the 1980s Seattle-based grunge rock bands Green River and Mother Love Bone. He is known particularly for playing with the fretless bass, upright bass, and twelve-string bass guitars. Ament is also a member of the bands Temple of the Dog, Three Fish, RNDM, Tres Mts., and P.E.S.T.

In 2008, Ament released his first solo album, &quot;Tone&quot;. His second solo release, &quot;While My Heart Beats&quot;, followed in 2012, and his third in 2018: &quot;Heaven/Hell&quot;. Ament was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pearl Jam on April 7, 2017. He was also recognized as one of the top hard rock/metal bassists of all time by Loudwire in 2016, being placed at #52 on the list.

==Biography==

===Early life===
The first of 12 children, Ament was born in Havre, Montana to George and Penny Ament and grew up in the town of Big Sandy, Montana, a town with a population of less than 700 people. Ament&#x27;s father George was mayor of Big Sandy for fifteen years, as well as a barber and a school bus driver. Ament described his family growing up as &quot;pretty poor&quot; and &quot;hard-core Catholic.&quot;

He began playing the bass guitar as a teenager, often playing along with Ramones, The Clash, and The Police records. Ament participated in basketball, football, and track at Big Sandy High School, where he graduated in 1981. He then attended the University of Montana in Missoula, Montana, where he studied art and played basketball. Ament quit college in the middle of his second year after the university told him they were no longer going to continue its graphic design program. In 1983, Ament relocated to Seattle, Washington with his band Deranged Diction. While in Seattle, Ament got a job working at a coffee shop in Belltown.

===Green River===

Ament became acquainted with fellow Seattle musicians Mark Arm and Steve Turner, and he was asked to join their new band Green River in 1984. The band also included drummer Alex Vincent, with guitarist Stone Gossard eventually being added to the line-up. By the time the band finished the recording of its debut EP, &quot;Come on Down&quot;, Turner decided to leave the group, citing his distaste with Ament and Gossard&#x27;s heavy metal leanings. He was replaced by Ament&#x27;s former Deranged Diction bandmate, Bruce Fairweather.

The band released the EP &quot;Come on Down&quot; in 1985 and followed it up with &quot;Dry As a Bone&quot; in 1987, the first non-compilation release on Sub Pop records. The band&#x27;s only full-length studio album, &quot;Rehab Doll&quot;, was released in 1988. In-fighting lead to the group&#x27;s break-up during the recording of &quot;Rehab Doll&quot;. A stylistic division had developed between Ament and Gossard on one side, and Arm on the other. Ament and Gossard wanted to pursue a major-label deal, while Arm wanted to remain independent, viewing the duo as being too careerist. Regarding the accusation, Ament later said that during his time with the band he had to work at a restaurant in order to pay his rent, while the other members were supported by their parents. He said, &quot;Did I want to play music and have my rent paid for? Hell yeah.&quot; The band achieved a considerable local reputation in Seattle and had a significant influence on the genre later known as grunge, with Green River being described as &quot;arguably the first grunge band.&quot;

===Mother Love Bone===

Following Green River&#x27;s dissolution, Ament established Mother Love Bone in 1988 along with former Green River members Gossard and Fairweather, former Malfunkshun frontman Andrew Wood, and former Ten Minute Warning and Skin Yard drummer Greg Gilmore. The band quickly worked on recording and performing locally and by late 1988 had become one of Seattle&#x27;s more promising bands. In early 1989 the band signed to PolyGram subsidiary Mercury Records. In March of that year the group issued its debut EP, &quot;Shine&quot;.

In late 1989 the group returned to the studio to record its debut studio album, &quot;Apple&quot;. It was planned for a March 1990 release. Only days before the release of &quot;Apple&quot;, however, frontman Wood, who had a long history with drug problems, overdosed on heroin. After spending a few days in the hospital in a coma, Wood died, effectively bringing Mother Love Bone to an end. &quot;Apple&quot; was released later that year.

===Temple of the Dog===

Following Wood&#x27;s death, Ament and Gossard almost parted company. Ament briefly spent time in the band War Babies, but he eventually got back together with Gossard and a childhood friend of Gossard&#x27;s named Mike McCready. The trio were attempting to form their own band when they were invited to be part of the Temple of the Dog project founded by Soundgarden&#x27;s Chris Cornell as a musical tribute to Andrew Wood. Cornell had been Wood&#x27;s roommate. Ament described the collaboration as &quot;a really good thing at the time&quot; for him and Gossard that put them into a &quot;band situation where we could play and make music.&quot; The band&#x27;s lineup was completed by the addition of Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron.

The band started rehearsing songs that Cornell had written on tour prior to Wood&#x27;s death, as well as re-working some existing material from demos written by Gossard and Ament. This project eventually featured vocalist Eddie Vedder, who had arrived in Seattle to audition to be the singer for Ament and Gossard&#x27;s next band, which later became Pearl Jam. Vedder sang a duet with Cornell on the song &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; and provided background vocals on several other songs. The band decided that it had enough material for an entire album and, in April 1991, &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot; was released through A&amp;M Records.

===Pearl Jam===
Pearl Jam was formed in 1990 by Ament, Gossard, and McCready, who then recruited Vedder and drummer Dave Krusen. The band originally took the name Mookie Blaylock, but was forced to change it when the band signed to Epic Records in 1991. After the recording sessions for &quot;Ten&quot; were completed, Krusen left Pearl Jam in May 1991. Krusen was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the &quot;Alive&quot; video, Chamberlain left to join the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; band. As his replacement, Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese, who joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam&#x27;s live shows supporting the &quot;Ten&quot; album.

&quot;Ten&quot; broke the band into the mainstream, and became one of the best selling alternative albums of the 1990s. The band found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene and the genre known as grunge. The single &quot;Jeremy&quot; received Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Song and Best Hard Rock Performance in 1993. Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its music video for &quot;Jeremy&quot;, including Video of the Year and Best Group Video. &quot;Ten&quot; was ranked number 207 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and &quot;Jeremy&quot; was ranked number 11 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest songs of the &#x27;90s.

Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, &quot;Vs.&quot;, released in 1993. Upon its release, &quot;Vs.&quot; set at the time the record for most copies of an album sold in a week, and spent five weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Vs.&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. From &quot;Vs.&quot;, the song &quot;Daughter&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and the song &quot;Go&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.

Feeling the pressures of success, the band decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos. &quot;Ten years from now,&quot; Ament said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want people to remember our songs as videos.&quot; In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, which lasted for three years and limited the band&#x27;s ability to tour in the United States. Ament took an active role during Pearl Jam&#x27;s dispute with Ticketmaster in 1994 over prices and surcharges. Along with Gossard, Ament testified before a congressional subcommittee, arguing that Ticketmaster&#x27;s practices were anti-competitive.

Later that same year the band released its third studio album, &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s third straight album to reach multi-platinum status. The album received Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album in 1996. &quot;Vitalogy&quot; was ranked number 492 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The lead single &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot; won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Although Abbruzzese performed on the album &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, he was fired in August 1994, four months before the album was released. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, he disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott. He was replaced by Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder and the former and original drummer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

The band subsequently released &quot;No Code&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Yield&quot; in 1998. In 1998, prior to Pearl Jam&#x27;s U.S. Yield Tour, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam enlisted former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron as Irons&#x27; replacement on an initially temporary basis, but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; (from &quot;Yield&quot;) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was released on the band&#x27;s 1998 fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999. &quot;Last Kiss&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting single.

In 2000, the band released its sixth studio album, &quot;Binaural&quot;, and initiated a successful and ongoing series of official bootlegs. The band released seventy-two such live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at the same time. &quot;Grievance&quot; (from &quot;Binaural&quot;) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The band released its seventh studio album, &quot;Riot Act&quot;, in 2002. Pearl Jam&#x27;s contribution to the 2003 film, &quot;Big Fish&quot;, &quot;Man of the Hour&quot;, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 2004. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, the eponymous &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, was released in 2006. The band released its ninth studio album, &quot;Backspacer&quot;, in 2009 its tenth studio album, &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;, in 2013 and its eleventh studio album &quot;Gigaton&quot; in 2020.

Aside from his musical contributions for the band, Ament has made significant contributions to the band&#x27;s album artwork. His photography can be found throughout the majority of the band&#x27;s releases. He has won two Grammy Awards for Best Recording Package for his work on the album &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot; and on Chris Cornell&#x27;s self-titled compilation.

==Other musical projects==
===Three Fish===

Ament had a side project band named Three Fish, which he formed in 1994 with Robbi Robb of Tribe After Tribe and Richard Stuverud of the Fastbacks. Three Fish released two albums, &quot;Three Fish&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Quiet Table&quot; (1999).

===&quot;Mirror Ball&quot;===

Ament performed with other members of Pearl Jam on Neil Young&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Mirror Ball&quot;, and subsequently took part in an eleven-date tour in Europe as part of Young&#x27;s backing band. This tour proved very successful with Young&#x27;s manager Elliot Roberts calling it &quot;One of the greatest tours we ever had in our whole lives.&quot;

===&quot;Tone&quot;===

On September 16, 2008, Ament released his first solo album, &quot;Tone&quot;, through Monkeywrench Records. The album features ten songs written over a span of 12 years. The album&#x27;s songs feature a raw, experimental sound. 3,000 copies of &quot;Tone&quot; were pressed and were distributed through independent record stores across the United States as well as through Pearl Jam&#x27;s official website. The album, like their others is also available via Pearl Jam&#x27;s official website.

===&quot;Tres Mts.&quot;===
On January 24, 2011 Ament announced on Pearl Jam&#x27;s official website his side project with dUg Pinnick of King&#x27;s X and Richard Stuverud of the Fastbacks. The band&#x27;s official Facebook page announced a March 2011 release of their album, &quot;Three Mountains&quot;, through Monkeywrench Records.

===&quot;RNDM&quot;===

In 2012, Ament started another band with singer-songwriter Joseph Arthur and drummer Richard Stuverud.

==Other work==
Ament had a brief acting cameo in the 1992 movie, &quot;Singles&quot;, along with Stone Gossard and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. He appeared as himself, playing bass in lead actor Matt Dillon&#x27;s backing band, Citizen Dick. Most of Matt Dillon&#x27;s wardrobe in the movie actually belonged to Ament. During the making of the film Ament produced a list of song titles for the fictional band. Chris Cornell took it as a challenge to write songs for the film using those titles, and &quot;Spoonman&quot; was one of them. The title of &quot;Spoonman&quot; is credited to Ament in the liner notes for Soundgarden&#x27;s 1994 album, &quot;Superunknown&quot;. 

With his brother Barry, Ament founded Ames Bros., an art production company that produces tour posters and album artwork for many bands, including Pearl Jam. The brothers won a Grammy Award in 2020 for &quot;Best Recording Package&quot; as a result of their work as art directors on the Chris Cornell posthumous compilation album titled &quot;Chris Cornell&quot;.

In 2022 Ament scored, together with Josh Klinghoffer, the FX on Hulu television series &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot;, adaptation of Jon Krakauer’s best-selling book. 

==Musical style and influences==
Ament has cited the Who, Ramones, the Clash, Led Zeppelin, and Neil Young as his biggest musical influences. In an interview, Ament stated:
I have to be able to feel the bass. I&#x27;ve worked hard with our producers to make sure that when you play our records on your stereo, you can feel the bass. You might not necessarily be able to hear it all the time, but if you turn it up you can feel the movement in the low end—that it&#x27;s moving the song. And when it&#x27;s not there, it should be creating a dynamic.

Ament makes a major songwriting contribution to Pearl Jam. He wrote the music for one of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;Jeremy&quot;, as well as &quot;Nothingman&quot; (from &quot;Vitalogy&quot;). His contributions to Pearl Jam&#x27;s songs have not been limited to music with Ament having written the lyrics for the &quot;Yield&quot; songs &quot;Pilate&quot; and &quot;Low Light&quot;, the &quot;Binaural&quot; songs &quot;Gods&#x27; Dice&quot; and &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot;, &quot;Help Help&quot; (from &quot;Riot Act&quot;), &quot;Other Side&quot; (from the &quot;Save You&quot; single), and &quot;Sweet Lew&quot; (from &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;). As well as bass contributions, Ament has often provided backing vocals and has played guitar on two of the Pearl Jam songs he had written musically: &quot;Smile&quot; (from &quot;No Code&quot;) and &quot;Bee Girl&quot; (from &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;). He performs lead vocal duties on &quot;Sweet Lew&quot; and also on the Ramones cover &quot;I Just Want To Have Something To Do&quot;. He plays guitar and keyboard on Dance of the Clairvoyants (from Gigaton).

In 2011, Ament endorsed luthier Mike Lull, and a signature model was produced, which is available in four different colors.

==Personal life==
A self-professed NBA fanatic, Ament is a lifelong supporter of the former Seattle SuperSonics NBA basketball team, and for 10 consecutive years he held season tickets to the team at Key Arena. The bassist is also an avid basketball player and his passion prompted him to suggest NBA player Mookie Blaylock as the name of the band that is now Pearl Jam.

Ament is also an avid reader and has cited Mikhail Bulgakov and Cormac McCarthy as his favorite authors. 

On February 16, 2016, he married longtime partner Pandora Andre-Beatty.

Ament currently lives in Seattle, Washington and Missoula, Montana. Aside from music, Ament&#x27;s interests include skateboarding, basketball, graphic design, snowboarding, and wakeboarding. Ament assisted in financing the construction of Missoula&#x27;s Mobash Skatepark. In 2004, Ament and his wife Pandora Andre-Beatty climbed Africa&#x27;s Mount Kilimanjaro in support of Save the Children. Since 2014, Ament and Andre-Beatty have funded and operated the Montana Pool Service Foundation, a registered 501(c)3. Ament and Montana Pool Service have helped build over 30 skate parks in the state of Montana, including many on Native American reservations. 

Ament is a supporter of organic farming and United States Senator Jon Tester. Tester grew up near Big Sandy and Ament knew of Tester before either were famous. Ament campaigned for Tester in 2006 and 2018.

Ament is credited for the album artwork and art direction for the Pearl Jam albums Ten (album), the album photograph for Vs. (Pearl Jam album), and created the concept for Yield (album), which was nominated for the Best Recording Package Grammy in 1999. Ament has won two Grammys for his art design for the Pearl Jam album Lightning Bolt (Pearl Jam album) and the posthumous Chris Cornell compilation Chris Cornell (album). 

In April 2009, Ament was attacked at knifepoint by a gang of muggers. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ament had just pulled up outside the Southern Tracks recording studio in Atlanta, Georgia, when his rented jeep was attacked by several men, who smashed the vehicle&#x27;s windows and demanded money. The magazine also reported that Ament was knocked to the ground while trying to escape the robbers. He sustained a head injury and was treated at the scene. His Blackberry, passport and cash were stolen. The incident would lead one fan, Joe Hartgrove, with the idea of a charity in Ament&#x27;s name, called &quot;Jeff Ament&#x27;s Army&quot;, to be formed by Joe, Roger McDaniel and Joanna Traver, and with the approval of Ament, started in 2011; their work includes the promoting of skate parks in the state of Montana.

<text>The CBC Radio Orchestra was a Canadian orchestra based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that was operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Until the early 1980s the CBC had a number of orchestras located in Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax but due to federal government budget cuts they were eliminated and the CBC Vancouver Orchestra was promoted to national status. It changed names in 2000 to reflect its status as the CBC&#x27;s only broadcast orchestra; the last radio orchestra in North America.

==History==
The orchestra was founded in 1938 under the name the CBC Vancouver Chamber Orchestra. A predecessor of the CBC, the Canadian National Railway Radio network also had a radio orchestra. The Canadian National Railway Radio Orchestra was conducted by Henri Miro in 1931–32.
Over the years guest conductors have included Franz Breuggen, Sir Neville Marinner, Alan Hovhaness, Boyd Neel, Raffi Armenian, Kees Bakels, Michel Corboz, Victor Feldbrill, Kazuyoshi Akiyama, Serge Garant, Monica Huggett, Milton Katims, Gary Kulesha, Sir Ernest MacMillan, Ettore Mazzoleni, Geoffrey Moull, Harry Newstone, George Cleve, Brian Law, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Jaap Schroeder, Georg Tintner, Owen Underhill, Heinz Unger, Simon Streatfeild, Brian Law, Odaline de la Martinez, Rosemary Thomson, Bruce Pullen, Glen Mossop, Elmer Iseler, John Nelson, Janos Sandor, Bruce Dunn, Bernard Labadie, Grzegorz Nowak, Helmut Rilling, Keri-Lynn Wilson, Pinchas Zukerman, Louis Lortie, Susan Haig, Jacques Lacombe, Earl Stafford, Daniel Swift, Timothy Vernon, Andrew Parrott, and Jon Washburn. Most of Canada&#x27;s leading concert artists have appeared as soloists.

The orchestra had 45 members at the time its dissolution was announced. It has had only four conductors in its existence. The first was John Avison who led the orchestra until 1980. For 2 years the baton was held by John Eliot Gardiner. Between 1984 and 2006 the lead conductor was Mario Bernardi. On April 30, 2006, Canadian trombonist Alain Trudel was named musical director of the orchestra, replacing Mario Bernardi as of fall 2006.

The orchestra generally performed two (fall and winter/spring) or three concert series each season. It has performed in Festival Vancouver for a number of years. Past tours have included an Arctic Tour in 1973, Coastal B.C. tour in the early 1970s, Markham and Toronto, Ontario in the late 1990s, a trip to Yellowknife in December 2004 and to Iqaluit, Baffin Island in September 2008. The orchestra performed most of its concerts at the Chan Shun Concert Hall at the University of British Columbia. Although from time to time it also performed at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver. For 70 years the orchestra&#x27;s main services were as a studio broadcast and vinyl l.p. and c.d. recording orchestra responsible for an active program of commissioning, performing and recording new Canadian compositions. In 2004 an album of its recordings won a Juno Award for Large Ensemble Classical Recording. This successful business plan was later altered and they were restricted to performing in public broadcast concerts only at the Chan Shun Concert Hall and continued broadcast recordings from Studio One in Vancouver. 

The CBC also formed the CBC Symphony Orchestra in Toronto in 1952, relying heavily on members of the Toronto Symphony. The ensemble had weekly broadcasts until it was disbanded in 1964.

==Demise==
The orchestra was disbanded on November 16, 2008, with its final concert on that date ending its 70-year existence.

The orchestra&#x27;s disbanding was unpopular in the classical music community, and there was significant coverage in the media including a long front-page article in the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, a prominent article in Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;Georgia Straight&quot; and coverage in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. There were also protests outside CBC locations across Canada. Several Members of Parliament from different parties expressed their opposition to the orchestra&#x27;s demise at a meeting of the House Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage on May 2, 2008; Bill Siksay (NDP - Burnaby—Douglas), Denis Coderre (Liberal Canadian Heritage Critic), Joyce Murray (Liberal - Point Grey) and Ed Fast (Conservative - Abbotsford).

==National Broadcast Orchestra==

On November 1, 2008, CBCRO musical director Alain Trudel announced that the orchestra would attempt to continue independently of the CBC, as the National Broadcast Orchestra of Canada with plans to perform six to 10 concerts a year with a contingent of between 35 and 50 players. The NBO would have a projected budget of $1 million to be provided through fundraising though the ensemble hopes to eventually qualify for government grants. Trudel says the orchestra will continue to concentrate on North American music and new works by Canadian composers and intends to be a multimedia orchestra utilizing webcasting as well as undertaking radio and television projects. This attempt failed as nothing further was heard from the NBO and Trudel. In 2010 the orchestra, based in Vancouver, prepared for its first concert; the program included &quot;The Sparrow’s Ledger&quot;, a CBC-commissioned composition by Michael Oesterle.

<doc id="580213" wikidata="Q1405823" url="?curid=580213" title="Duryodhana">
<text>Duryodhana (, , ), also known as Suyodhana, is the primary antagonist in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata.&quot; He was the eldest of the Kauravas, the hundred sons of the king Dhritarashtra and his queen Gandhari.

Being the first-born son of the king, he was the crown prince of the Kuru Kingdom and its capital of Hastinapura, often forced into ceding the title to his cousin Yudhishthira, who was one of the Pandava brothers and older than he. Aided by his maternal uncle Shakuni, Duryodhana tricked the Pandavas into surrendering their kingdom and forced them to go into exile. Later, Duryodhana waged the Kurukshetra War against his cousins and was helped by the warriors Bhishma, Drona and Karna. On the eighteenth day of the war, he was killed by Bheema. Duryodhana used his greater skill in wielding the mace to defeat his opponents. He was also an extremely courageous warrior but his greed and arrogance were the two qualities said to have led to his downfall.

==Birth==
When Gandhari&#x27;s pregnancy continued for an unusually long period of time, Her mother-in-law Ambika and Ambalika were very upset with her. Pandu and Kunti earlier bore a son whom they named Yudhishthira. So she beat her womb in frustration. This caused a hardened mass of grey-coloured flesh to issue from her womb. She implored Vyasa, the great sage who had blessed her as &quot;Shata Putra Praptirasthu&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;blessed with a hundred sons&quot;), to redeem his words. Vyasa divided the ball of flesh into one hundred and one equal pieces and put them in pots of milk, which were sealed and buried into the earth for two years. At the end of the second year, the first pot was opened, and Duryodhana emerged.

==Early years==
Although loved by his family, Duryodhana and most of his brothers were not seen on the same level as the Pandavas in their adherence to virtue, duty, and respect for elders. Duryodhana felt that the partiality everyone showed to the Pandavas was only due to the circumstances of their birth. Duryodhana was mentored by his maternal uncle Shakuni, who masterminded most of Duryodhana&#x27;s plots to humiliate and kill the Pandavas.

Duryodhana&#x27;s hatred for the Pandavas stemmed from his sincere belief that he being the son of the eldest brother should be the heir apparent to the throne of Hastinapura. Because of his father&#x27;s (Dhritarashtra) blindness, his father had to renounce the throne in favour of his younger brother, Pandu. Duryodhana deeply believed that what was rightfully his was being given away to his older cousin Yudhishthira. He also felt that the Pandavas were the sons of Kunti and devas/deities, and not of Pandu. He never believed that their divine origin alone proved their superiority. On many occasions he questioned their merits and always called them &#x27;Kaunteya&#x27; (sons of Kunti). He would never accept the Pandavas as his brothers but always did his best to restrain them. He also bore a deep hatred of Bhima, who was younger and but stronger than he and dominated his brothers in sport and skill with his immense physical power and strength. Out of anger and jealousy, he even tried to poison Bhima, but was unsuccessful.

===Training===

Learning martial skills from his gurus Dronacharya, he proved to be extremely skilled with the mace. He then went to specialize in mace fighting under Balarama, so as to gain sympathy from him and went on to become his favourite pupil. Balarama described Duryodhana&#x27;s body to be &quot;lightning made flesh&quot;

===Relationship with Karna===
At the martial exhibition where the Kaurava and Pandava princes demonstrated their skills before their elders, their guru Drona and the people of that kingdom, Karna appeared and challenged an unsuspecting Arjuna, who is considered to be the best of the princes. But Karna was stopped when Kripa asked him to ascertain his lineage, as it would be inappropriate for unequal to compete. Karna, not being a kshatriya, bowed his head in shame.

Duryodhana immediately defended Karna, arguing that it is skill and bravery, and not birth, that defines a warrior. Using the boon granted to him by Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana made Karna king of Anga so that he was regarded as Arjuna&#x27;s equal. Karna pledged his allegiance and friendship to Duryodhana. Neither of them knew that Karna was in fact Kunti&#x27;s oldest son, born to (the sun god) Surya, before her marriage to Pandu.

In the Kurukshetra War, Karna was Duryodhana&#x27;s greatest champion and served as commander from the fifteenth day. Duryodhana sincerely believed that Karna was superior to Arjuna, and would defeat his four brothers. When Karna was killed, Duryodhana mourned his death intensely, even more so than the death of his own brothers and was inconsolable. When Karna&#x27;s identity was revealed to him, Duryodhana&#x27;s love for Karna only grew and it is said to be he, and not the Pandavas, who performed Karna&#x27;s last rites. Krishna confirmed that he had the highest right over Karna, as they loved and supported each other truly.

===Tendencies and schemes===

During their childhood, Bhima used his brute strength to inflict injuries on the Kaurava brothers. As Bhima loved eating, Duryodhana, guided by Shakuni, attempted to kill Bhima by feeding him poison, but Bhima survived the trap and emerged even stronger than before. Duryodhana then participated in a plot by Shakuni to burn the Pandavas in a house of wax at Varnavata; however, they managed to escape the trap having been warned by Vidura.

== Marriage and children ==
In the &quot;Shanti Parva&quot;, the divine sage Narada narrated the marriage of Duryodhana with the daughter of King Chitrangada of Kalinga. The wife of Duryodhana was unnamed in the original epic, and is named Bhanumati in later renditions and adaptations of the epic .

Duryodhana abducted her from her swayamvara (self-choice ceremony) with the help of his friend Karna in the wake of having been rejected by her. On reaching Hastinapur, Duryodhana justified his act by giving the example of his grandfather Bhishma abducting three princesses of Kashi for his stepbrother.

Lakshmana Kumara and Lakshmanā were the children of Duryodhana and Bhanumati. Little is revealed about them in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; other than Lakshmana Kumara&#x27;s death in the Kurukshetra War and Lakshmanā&#x27;s marriage to Krishna&#x27;s son Samba.

==Usurping the Kingdom==

After the Pandavas revealed that they had survived the wax house, with a new wife to boot, Bhishma suggested that the kingdom be divided in order to ease the obvious tension. Yudhishthira is given half the kingdom and made king of Khandavprastha, so as to avoid a clash with the Kaurava princes over the whole Kuru Kingdom. Duryodhana became the crown prince of Hastinapura, and owing to the age and blindness of his father, he accumulated much control and influence, managing the state affairs himself with a group of his advisers that included his uncle Shakuni, brother Dushasana, Bhishma, Vidura, and Karna.
But Duryodhana remained jealous of Yudhishthira, especially after the Pandavas along with Krishna transformed Khandavaprastha to Indraprastha. Moreover, Yudhishthira performed the Rajasuya Yagna and gained authority over several other kingdoms; Indraprastha&#x27;s prosperity and fame appeared to exceed Hastinapura&#x27;s. Duryodhana was unable to contain his anger, which was intensified when Bhima, Arjuna, the twins and the servants laughed at him when he slipped into a pool of water during a visit to Indraprastha.

In popular culture, television shows and post-modern novels on Mahabharata attribute this blame to Draupadi with an added statement &quot;the son of the blind man also is blind&quot;, but the scene in the canonical text of Vyasa&#x27;s Sanskrit epic is different. As per original scripture written by Ved Vyasa Draupadi didn&#x27;t taunt Duryodhana.
This enraged Duryodhana and increases his hostility towards the Pandavas.

===The dice plot, and Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation===
Duryodhana&#x27;s jealousy of the prosperity and fame of Indraprastha and being humiliated by the Pandavas made him furious and he wished to throw down the Pandavas. To support his will, Shakuni devised a scheme to rob Yudhishthira of his kingdom and wealth by defeating him in a Pakida or game of dice, in which Shakuni couldn&#x27;t lose as he had dice which he could control.

Unable to decline the invitation, due to diplomacy, Yudhishthira gambled away his entire kingdom, his wealth, his four brothers and even his wife, in a series of gambits to retrieve one by staking another. After Yudhishthira lost Draupadi, On advise of Karna ,Duryodhana encouraged his brother Dushasana to drag her into the court as she was now his property. Dushsana pulled Draupadi&#x27;s hair and dragged her into the court. Karna asked Duryodhana to make Draupadi to sit on his left thigh,Thus Duryodhana showed and patted his left thigh to insult her for revenge. Draupadi refused and Duryodhan ordered Dushashan to disrobe her. Following his brother&#x27;s orders, Dushashan laughed and started pulling Draupadi&#x27;s saree. Duryodhan, Karna, Shakuni, and the other Kauravas (except Vikarna, Vidura) also started laughing. However, by Krishna&#x27;s grace, Draupadi&#x27;s amount of clothing remained the same.

Due to this action, Bhima pledged that he would break Duryodhana&#x27;s thigh.

As an enraged Draupadi was about to curse the Kuru clan, Gandhari intervened. Fearing retribution by the Pandavas, their allies, and history, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari reversed all of Yudhishthira&#x27;s losses. But then (either through Duryodhana forcing his father to command the Pandavas to play again or through Shakuni&#x27;s vicious tricks) the game was repeated. For this game of dice Shakuni set the condition that upon losing, Yudhishthira and his brothers must spend thirteen years in exile in the forest and one year of &quot;Agyatavasa&quot; (remain unknown to others possibly by a disguise) before they reclaim their kingdom. The thirteenth year must be passed incognito, or else the term of exile would be repeated. The Pandavas lost and began their exile.

==Virata War==
Duryodhana was a good friend of Matsya Kingdom&#x27;s commander-in-chief Kichaka. When Bhima killed him for humiliating Draupadi, Duryodhana blamed Matsya&#x27;s King Virata for his friend Kichaka&#x27;s death. Virata got angry and ordered Duryodhana to get out of his Kingdom after insulting him. Duryodhana took his army and attacked Matsya. He ordered his wife&#x27;s cousin Susharma to attack Matsya from other side but they failed to conquer it because Arjuna and Bhima defended it.

==The Kurukshetra War==
===Peace Talks and Buildup===

At the end of the exile term, Duryodhana refused to return Yudhishthira&#x27;s kingdom, despite the counsel of Bhishma, Dronacharya, and Vidura. Although Dhritarashtra openly criticized his son, he tacitly desired that Durd with the Pandavas&#x27; final proposal: the Pandavas would give up all claims to Indraprastha and Hastinapura in exchange for five villages. Scoffing, Duryodhana said he will not even give even a needlepoint of land to the Pandavas. Egged on by Krishna, Duryodhana attempted to arrest him. Krishna revealed his Vishvarupa form. The entire Kaurava court, saved for Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, Kripa and Dhritarashtra (who was granted a divine vision in order to see that by supporting his son, he was going against God), was temporarily blinded by the form. This confirmed to those present that Krishna was indeed the Supreme being. Duryodhana, being vastly egoistic (in some versions of the story an outright atheist), brushed off the incident, not convinced of Krishna&#x27;s divinity, and believing that strength of arms, not philosophy, would win him a war.

===Gathering the army===

With war inevitable, Duryodhana gathered support from his powerful vassals. The most powerful warriors – Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Ashwatthama, Kripa, Shalya, Bhurisravas, Bhagadatta, Vrishasena, Kritavarma even those who were critical of him were forced to fight for Duryodhana due to their previous commitments. He ended up amassing a larger army than his rivals.

Shakuni also advised Duryodhana to seek Krishna&#x27;s help. Duryodhana rushed to Dwarka only to find Krishna sleeping; he waited at the head of Krishna&#x27;s bed when suddenly, Arjuna arrived with the same goal in mind. Arjuna waited at the foot of Krishna&#x27;s bed. When Krishna woke up, both Duryodhana and Arjuna appealed for his alliance. Krishna offered a choice of himself, completely unarmed or the entire Vrishni army. Duryodhana proclaimed that because he arrived first, he should get first pick. However, Krishna said that because he saw Arjuna first and because Arjuna was younger, that Arjuna gets the first choice. Duryodhana became worried but was overjoyed when Arjuna elected to reject Krishna&#x27;s army in favour of Krishna alone. Joyously, Duryodhana returned to Hastinapura with the Vrishni army in hand, only to be rebuked by Shakuni, who comments that Krishna is worth many armies by himself.

Duryodhana also managed to win the army of Shalya, the maternal uncle of Nakula and Sahadeva. Duryodhana intercepted Shalya&#x27;s army as it came to Kurukshetra and offered hospitality; Shalya accepted thinking Yudhishthira had made the offer. After Shalya had enjoyed Duryodhana&#x27;s comforts, Duryodhana revealed the duplicity and indicated that Shalya is now indebted to him. He used this indebtedness to extract Shalya&#x27;s army and support. Duryodhana wanted Shalya mainly so that Karna would have an equivalent charioteer to Arjuna&#x27;s Krishna.

===4th day===
Bhima attacked Duryodhana, pierced him and cut off his bow. In return, Duryodhana pierced Bhima, his Charioteer and cut off his bow. Duryodhana pierced Bhima with shafts on his breast. Bhima feeling great pain fled away from the battlefield.

=== 8th day ===
On the 8th day, Rakashasas of Ghatotkacha&#x27;s army attacked Duryodhana. Duryodhana slew many rakshasas like Vegavat, Maharudra, Vidyujihva and Pramathin. Later, he killed Visharada, son of Kunti-Bhoja.

=== 14th day ===
Uttamauja and Yudhamanyu (sons of Drupada) attacked Duryodhana and Duryodhana defeated them in mace fighting. After the death of Jayadratha, Duryodhana became very angry and he started killing the Pandava army. However, he is later defeated by Yudhishthira and flees.

During the nighttime battle between Ghatotkacha and Karna, Duryodhana urged Karna to use the Shakti against the Rakshas, due to the racial advantage during the night. Karna complied and reluctantly unleashed the great weapon, killing Ghatotkacha.

=== 15th day ===
Nakula attacked Duryodhana. Duryodhana fought with him and defeated Nakula, forcing him to flee in Chekitana&#x27;s chariot. 

=== 16th day ===
He tried to face Yudishthira and bravely withstood his onslaught. But soon, Yudishthira defeated him and destroyed his chariot. Luckily, he was rescued by Karna.

=== 17th day ===
Nakula and Sahadeva attacked Duryodhana. Duryodhana pierced them and nearly killed them. Later, Dhristadyumna saved them. Then many Pandava warriors, including Yudhishthira, Bhima, Dristadyumna, Satyaki, etc. all together attacked Duryodhana. However Duryodhana alone managed to resist all the Pandavas and he repelled the Pandavas&#x27; group attack single-handedly.

=== 18th day ===
On the 18th day, the Pandavas together had attacked Duryodhana but they were unsuccessful as Duryodhana alone resisted and defeated all of them. Duryodhana had also killed a Yadava warrior named Chekitana on that day. Later, he tried to defeat Dhrishtadyumna who was destroying the retreating Kaurava army. However, Dhrishtadyumna killed Duryodhana&#x27;s charioteer and destroyed his chariot, forcing Duryodhana to flee. He was the one of the only warriors who was able to defeat Duryodhana that day.

==Gada-Yuddha==

On the eighteenth day of the war, with his army reduced to himself, Ashwatthama, Kripa and Kritvarma, Duryodhana went to meditate in a lake. When the Pandavas and Krishna eventually found him, Duryodhana told them that he wanted to gift the kingdom to them and retire to the forest. Yudhishthira rejected the offer, telling him that Hastinapura is not Duryodhana&#x27;s to gift. Instead, he offered that Duryodhana may pick any of the Pandava brothers to fight against one-to-one with a weapon of his choice, with the winner of the conflict being the victor of the war.

Despite his proposed advantage over Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Nakula, or Sahadeva with the gada, Duryodhana picked his nemesis Bhima. Despite Bhima&#x27;s physical advantage, Duryodhana had the better technique due to his devotion to his craft. After a long and brutal battle between the two disciples of Balarama, Duryodhana began to exhaust Bhima and nearly made Bhima faint.

At this point, observing the fight, Krishna called out to Bhima and signaled him by repeatedly clapping his thigh with his hand. As intended, Bhima was reminded of an oath he had taken after the game of dice to crush Duryodhana&#x27;s thighs. Bhima victoriously attacked Duryodhana with his mace and struck his thigh, mortally wounding Duryodhana. After having his face insultingly kicked by Bhima, Duryodhana moaned that he was slain by unfair means, given that it was illegal to attack below the waist in a mace fight.

Infuriated at the violation, Balarama, the brother of Krishna, raised his weapon to attack. Krishna consoled Balarama by reminding him of Duryodhana&#x27;s evil deeds and reprimanded him for trying to influence a war he refused to participate in.

Lying defeated, Duryodhana boasted to the Pandavas about how he would die a glorious death, about how he got to enjoy Hastinapura while the Pandavas were in exile, and about how he would now spend the afterlife in the company of his friends and relatives. He again eviscerated the Pandavas for all their chicanery during the war and decried their legacy. Venerating his character, Duryodhana proclaimed he would die happily.

==Death==

When the coast was clear, Ashwatthama, Kripacharya, and Kritvarma, having witnessed the fight and not wanting to interrupt so as to rob Duryodhana of his honor, came to Duryodhana&#x27;s broken body. Ashwatthama promised Duryodhana that he would dispatch the Pandavas and their allies to the abode of Yama and requests his permission to continue the war. 
After killing the Upapandavas and the last remnants of the Panchalas, Ashwatthama returns to Duryodhana. He showed Duryodhana the blood on his sword which belonged to the Upapandavas, hearing Duryodhana peacefully left his body satisfied with revenge. Concomitant with Duryodhana&#x27;s death, Sanjaya loses his divine sight, which he had been using to update Duryodhana&#x27;s father Dhritarashtra. This symbolizes the conclusion to the war.

After the Pandavas retired, only Yudhishthira reached heaven alive. There, he saw Duryodhana, which shocked him. When asked by Yudhishthira, Narada replied that Duryodhana fulfilled his religious duties.

==Evaluation==

Duryodhana is a popular choice of analysis. His merits, flaws, symbolism, and relevance are widely discussed.

Urubhangam is a Sanskrit play written by Bhasa in the 2nd or 3rd century AD with Duryodhana as its primary protagonist. Written as a tragedy, the drama focuses on his point of view of the events of Mahabharata. His portrayal as a tragic hero is especially unique within the body of works in Sanskrit drama.

Many Hindus believe that Duryodhana was the personification of Kali (कलि) with demoniac qualities such as greed, ego and lust. Kali is a demon who presides over Kali-yuga. Many critics argue that he is not without positives; many consider Duryodhana as a fair king and there are temples dedicated to him and the Kauravas. Scholars believe that like most other characters of the Mahabharata, the true picture is not black and white. His name is often mistaken to mean bad ruler, however, his name is actually coined from the Sanskrit words &quot;du&quot;/&quot;duh&quot; which means &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;yodhana&quot; which means &quot;fight&quot;/&quot;war&quot;. So Duryodhana means &quot;someone who is difficult to conquer&quot;.

Duryodhana is viewed, by some, as the product of Dhritarashtra&#x27;s ambition and also in a metaphorical sense, his &quot;blindness&quot;. He is also praised for his adherence to his duties as a Kshatriya, and even in his last combat, fights bravely. He chooses to face Bhima in combat over all the other Pandavas, with whom he has an advantage in mace fighting. His skills in the mace are also praised; many stories call him the greatest mace-fighter of the age.

===Friendship with Karna===

The friendship between Karna and Duryodhana is considered to be a great one, and is used as an example of friendship and loyalty.

===Modern Worship===
* At Poruvazhy Peruviruthy Malanada Temple in Kerala&#x27;s Kollam district, Duryodhana is worshipped as the main deity. It is the only temple in South India where a Kaurava is considered a God.
* In the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand, several beautifully carved temples are dedicated to Duryodhana and he is worshipped as the deity. The mountain tribes of Kumaon fought along with Duryodhana in the Mahabharata war; he was venerated as a capable and generous administrator.
* There is a temple in Osla, Garhwal division of Uttarakhand. This was built by the inhabitants of Saur. People believe he stayed here with the blessings of Lord Mahasu to care for the people.

== In media ==
* &quot;Krishnavatara&quot; (Hindi: कृष्णअवतार), a series of seven novels written by Dr. K.M. Munshi (Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan)

<doc id="580222" wikidata="Q3481529" url="?curid=580222" title="Sharon Temple">
<text>The Sharon Temple is an open-air museum site, located in the village of Sharon, Ontario, that was in 1990 designated as a National Historic Site of Canada. It is composed of eight heritage buildings and dwellings, and houses 6,000 artifacts on a 1.8 ha. site. The building is made available for public use such as tours, concerts, weddings, and special occasions by its current owner, the Sharon Temple Museum Society.

It was constructed between 1825 and 1832 by The Children of Peace, a sect led by former Quaker David Willson on whose property it was built. Other restored buildings include David Willson&#x27;s Study, which is a smaller building. The Ebenezer Doan house of 1819, constructed by the temple&#x27;s master-builder and relocated from the former Doan family farm nearby, has been restored in an early garden setting. Also on site are the &quot;cook house&quot; where communal meals were created and served, the &quot;drive shed&#x27; complete with period carriages, and another of David Willson&#x27;s architectural curiosities, the round outhouse. The Ontario Heritage Trust has a public easement to ensure its preservation meets conservation standards.

==The historic structure and its traditional uses==

===The Children of Peace===

The leader of the sect was David Willson, who was born in New York State in 1778 and migrated to Upper Canada in 1801. He joined the Quakers of which his wife was a member, but his ministry was rejected when he began to preach at the beginning of the War of 1812. His sect placed great emphasis on ceremony, music and practical education. Followers of the sect were strong political reformers and Willson played a critical role in the creation of the Canadian Alliance Society, the first political party in the province. Several members joined William Lyon Mackenzie in the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion. They continued to play a key role in the development of democracy in Canada by ensuring the elections of both &quot;fathers of responsible government,&quot; Robert Baldwin and Louis LaFontaine, in their riding despite threats of political violence by the Orange Order. After Willson&#x27;s death in 1866 the sect slowly diminished. The last service was held in the temple in 1889.

===Symbolism===

Called by a vision to &quot;ornament the Christian Church with all the glory of Israel,” the Children of Peace rebuilt Solomon&#x27;s Temple as the seat of their &quot;New Jerusalem.” This three-tiered building was &quot;calculated to inspire the beholder with astonishment; its dimensions – its architecture – its situation – are all so extraordinary.” The Children of Peace, having fled a cruel and uncaring English pharaoh, viewed themselves as new Israelites lost in the wilderness of Upper Canada.
The symbolism of the temple is a careful blending of Quaker tradition and Old Testament imagery. The temple was built square (unlike Quaker meeting houses) signifying &quot;dealing on the square with all people. The door in the centre of the four sides is to let the people come in from the east and west, the north and south on equal and the same footing.&quot; At the centre of the building is the &quot;ark&quot; containing a bible open to the ten commandments. The ark is surrounded by four pillars: &quot;Faith, Hope, Love and Charity&quot; – the pillars of the church. Surrounding these inner pillars are twelve more, named after the disciples. The temple rises more than seventy feet (21 m) in three diminishing storeys, representing the Trinity. At each corner of the roof on every storey is an ornate lantern, capped with four golden spires; these twelve lanterns, &quot;when illuminated,&quot; are &quot;symbolical of the twelve apostles going out into the world to preach salvation.&quot; At the apex of the temple, suspended between the top four lanterns, is a golden globe; on this, the highest point in the village of Hope, they inscribed their highest hope – peace to the world.

===Uses===
The temple is an architectural representation of the Children of Peace&#x27;s vision of a society based on the values of peace, equality, and social justice. The building was used once a month to collect alms for the poor, for two special feasts, and on Christmas; two other meeting houses in the village of &quot;Hope&quot; (now Sharon) were used for regular Sunday worship.

The &quot;Illumination&quot; was an evening service held by candle-light in association with the group&#x27;s two annual feasts: the Feast of the Passover on David Willson&#x27;s birthday in June, and the Feast of the First Fruits on the first Friday evening in September. The feast held the next day attracted over a thousand.

These Illumination ceremonies were also used for political purposes. For example, Willson timed election rallies for Members of Parliament Robert Baldwin and Louis LaFontaine to coincide with the Illumination and Feasts in 1843.

===Ebenezer Doan, master builder===

The &quot;Master Builder&quot; or architect-contractor in charge of designing and building the Sharon Temple is Ebenezer Doan (1772–1866). Doan was a highly accomplished builder, as evidenced by the creative techniques used in the temple structure. The simple rock foundation does not even go below the frost line; yet the building remains structurally sound after more than 175 years. Doan was an early Quaker immigrant from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who joined the Children of Peace in 1812. His first house (1819), drive shed and granary have now been relocated on the temple grounds and restored.

==The temple as museum==
===The York Pioneer &amp; Historical Society Period===
Under the impetus of the Rev. James L. Hughes, the Toronto-based York Pioneer and Historical Society raised funds to purchase the temple and its grounds in 1917 and opened the temple as a museum in 1918. Shortly afterwards, the York Pioneers moved David Willson&#x27;s study to the site. This is significant as one of the earliest examples of historic preservation in Canada, one of the reasons for which the temple received its National Historic Designation in 1993. The York Pioneers collected artifacts from throughout York County and created a county museum and park, which they displayed in the temple. A baseball diamond, recreation area and refreshment stand were added on the surrounding grounds. In the 1950s, the site&#x27;s focus began to change, emphasizing the story of the Children of Peace. The York Pioneers restored and moved the 1819 home of Ebenezer Doan, master builder of the temple, and a log house associated with Jesse Doan, bandmaster of the Children of Peace, to the site. These acquisitions were followed in 1967, Canada&#x27;s centennial year, by the construction of an exhibit building. The baseball diamond and other remnants of the park&#x27;s early days were removed. Lastly, they moved the Cookhouse, and the Gatehouse, to the temple grounds.

====Music at Sharon====
To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the completion of the temple in 1981, the York Pioneer and Historical Society founded &quot;Music at Sharon,&quot; an annual summer concert series with Lawrence Cherney as artistic director. The series was presented from 1981 to 1990. The concerts grew in number from five in the inaugural season to fourteen in 1989; in 1990 the entire festival was given over to the production of Serinette, a commissioned opera by Harry Somers. Music at Sharon commissioned new works by John Beckwith (Three Motets on Swan&#x27;s &#x27;China&#x27;), Phil Nimmons, Linda C. Smith, Carol Ann Weaver, Glen Buhr, Derek Holman, and many others. A commemorative album of the first series featuring the Elmer Iseler Singers and an instrumental ensemble directed by John Beckwith was issued (1982, Melbourne SMLP-4041/RCI 554). The majority of the concerts were broadcast on CBC radio.

====Samuel Lount, the film====
The 1985 film &quot;Samuel Lount&quot; was largely filmed on the temple site, and released in December 1985. It was produced by Elivira Lount, a descendant of the martyr of the Rebellion of 1837, and written and directed by Laurence Keane. R.H. Thomson appeared as Samuel Lount and David Fox as David Willson.

====Serinette, the opera====
&quot;Serinette&quot;, a &#x27;Festival opera&#x27; in two acts with music by Harry Somers and libretto by James Reaney, was commissioned with the support of the Canada Council and the Ontario Arts Council for the tenth season (1990) of Music at Sharon; it was designed specifically for production in the temple. It premiered on 7 July 1990, and was broadcast on CBC radio&#x27;s &#x27;Saturday Afternoon at the Opera&#x27;. The production was conducted by Victor Feldbrill, directed by Keith Turnbull, and designed by Sue LePage. Reaney&#x27;s libretto is based on an historical feud between the Ridout and Jarvis families in the 1830s, and the attraction of the fictitious central figure, Colin Jarvis (&#x27;younger brother&#x27; of the historical Samuel Jarvis) to the utopian community at Sharon. A central symbol is the &quot;serinette,&quot; a mechanical singing bird imported from Europe. Each act began with the performers and audience processing into the building; the finale was performed inside the candle-lit Temple with the spectators observing from outside, in imitation of the original annual &quot;illumination&quot; of the temple. The success of the opera led to the rebirth of the now annual tradition of a fall &quot;illumination.&quot; The work calls for 14 singer-actors, and a 12-piece chamber orchestra.

===The Sharon Temple Museum Society===
In 1991 the charitable, not-for-profit Sharon Temple Museum Society was created, and it assumed the obligations of the York Pioneer and Historical Society, and now owns and maintains the site and its legacy of buildings, artifacts and documents.

The temple is now a National Historic Site and museum as well as a National Peace Site. The 2010 album &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot; by Loreena McKennitt was recorded there in the summer of 2010. McKennitt remarked, &quot;There is a fascinating interplay between architecture and sound, visually and sonically. The temple inspired us all.&quot; The site and grounds are kept busy and host numerous public and private events.

==Restoration==
Since the temple was rescued from demolition by the York Pioneer and Historical Society in 1917, the building has undergone periodic restoration work but without significant structural intervention.

<text>Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey (11 February 1836 – 23 February 1918), was a British Liberal Party politician, governor of the Colony of Victoria and founder of &quot;The Naval Annual&quot;.

==Background and education==
Brassey was the eldest son of the railway magnate Thomas Brassey (1805–1870), by his wife Maria Harrison, a daughter of Joseph Harrison, a forwarding and shipping agent. He was the elder brother of Henry Brassey and Albert Brassey. He was educated at Rugby and University College, Oxford, and was called to the Bar, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, in 1864.

==Political career==
Brassey was briefly Member of Parliament (MP) for Devonport in 1865, winning the seat at a by-election in June and then losing it again the general election in July. He returned to Parliament three years later as the representative for Hastings at the 1868 general election, holding that seat until he was defeated at the 1886 general election. He was President of the first day of the 1874 Co-operative Congress.
He served under William Ewart Gladstone as Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1880 to 1884 and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty from 1884 to 1884. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1881 and raised to the peerage as Baron Brassey, of Bulkeley in the County of Chester, in 1886. He again held office under Gladstone and then Lord Rosebery as a Lord-in-waiting from 1893 to 1895. In 1893 Queen Victoria appointed nine members as the Royal Opium Commission, which consisted of seven British and two Indian members, which was headed by Lord Brassey, who served as the Chairman. The commission was to report on whether India Opium export trade to far east (China) should be ended and, further, whether poppy growing and consumption of Opium in India itself should be prohibited save for medical purpose.

==Governor of Victoria==
From 1895 to 1900 he was Governor of Victoria, a colony in Australia, and lived in its capital, Melbourne, in Government House. He returned to the United Kingdom in March 1900, by way of Colombo.

Brassey is remembered in Australia&#x27;s national capital, Canberra, with Brassey House, now a hotel (originally a guest house) in the inner suburb of Barton, Australian Capital Territory, completed in 1927 to coincide with the relocation of the Federal Parliament from Melbourne to Canberra. Brassey House originally offered 45 rooms with shared bathing facilities, for the exclusive use of members of parliament and mid-level government officials relocating to Canberra. During the mid 1960s the government of the day expanded the capacity to 131 rooms and added conference and meeting rooms. It was sold in the mid-1980s to local businessmen and has been operated since as a residential hotel, now with 75 rooms including ensuites. It is said to have been built back-to-front, with the more ornate façade facing Belmore Gardens and its plainer face to Macquarie Street.

==Sailing==
Brassey&#x27;s first experience of sailing was while he was still at Rugby school. After a short spell in a hired yacht called &quot;Zillah&quot; he started to compete successfully in club events in a yacht called &quot;Cymba&quot; (1855). In 1859 he acquired the 120-ton iron yacht &quot;Albatross&quot;, designed by his friend St Clare John Byrne and built at his father&#x27;s Canada Works. He was elected as a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron at this time. In 1866 he ventured into auxiliary steam with the yacht &quot;Meteor&quot; and in 1872 used the steam yacht &quot;Eothen&quot; to visit Canada, but she proved not to be best suited for this type of work. &quot;Eothen&quot; had formerly been owned by P&amp;O co-founder Arthur Anderson.
Between 6 July 1876 and 27 May 1877 Brassey circumnavigated the world in his steam-assisted three-masted brigantine , another yacht designed for him by St Clare Byrne. This voyage is said to have been the first circumnavigation by a private yacht. His son Thomas left the &quot;Sunbeam&quot; at Rio de Janeiro in order to return to school in England. His wife Anna, Lady Brassey (1839–1887), published an account of the cruise called &quot;In The Trades, The Tropics, &amp; The Roaring Forties&quot;, or alternatively &quot;A Voyage in the Sunbeam: Our Home on the Ocean For Eleven Months&quot;. In 1880 Brassey&#x27;s book &quot;The British Navy&quot; was published. In 1886, he started &quot;The Naval Annual&quot; (generally referred to as &quot;Brassey&#x27;s Naval Annual&quot;) He edited &quot;The Naval Annual&quot; until 1891. He was succeeded as editor by his son Thomas.

At the age of 79 Brassey sailed his yacht &quot;Sunbeam&quot; to Moudros Bay as a hospital ship for the Gallipoli campaign.

==Honours and awards==
Brassey was President of the Royal Statistical Society from 1879 to 1880. He was conferred with Honorary Membership of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1891. Following his return from Australia, he was President of the London Chamber of Commerce 1901–1902. He served as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1908 to 1913. 

He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1906 and made Viscount Hythe, of Hythe in the County of Kent, and Earl Brassey in 1911.

He was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the part-time 6th (Hastings) Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteer Corps on 1 June 1861, and was later the captain of the 9th (Pevensey) Cinque Ports AVC. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the successor unit, the 2nd Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteers on 2 December 1891.

King David Kalākaua of Hawaii bestowed on Brassey the honour &quot;Knight Commander of the Royal Order of Kalākaua&quot;.

==Freemasonry==
Brassey was a freemason. He was initiated to the craft as an Oxford student. In 1868, he became a member of Abbey Lodge No. 1184 and remained for 48 years. He was also a member of Derwent Lodge No. 4 and a founding brother of Navy Lodge No. 2612. When he was appointed Governor of Victoria, while he had never held any Lodge office, he was appointed Honorary Past Junior Grand Warden. In Melbourne, became a member of Clarke Lodge No. 98 and became its Senior Warden in 1896 and its Worshipful Master in 1897. On 4 May 1896 two days before being installed as Senior Warden, he was installed Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Victoria. His becoming of Grand Master was a bit controversial because many members preferred then-current Grand Master Sir William Clarke, 1st Baronet to stay and nominated him again. Clarke said that he would like the nomination to be withdrawn if Brassey was willing to serve. Brassey approved and Clarke withdrew the nomination, so Brassey was the sole candidate and therefore elected Grand Master.

==Family==

Brassey married firstly, in 1860, Anna Allnutt, daughter of John Allnutt, of Clapham, Surrey. They had one son and four daughters. The third daughter, Lady Muriel Agnes, married Gilbert Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr, and was the mother of Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr, while the fourth daughter, Lady Marie Adelaide, married Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon. Lady Brassey died in September 1887, aged 47.

Brassey married secondly Lady Sybil de Vere Capell, daughter of Arthur Capell, Viscount Malden, and sister of George Capell, 7th Earl of Essex, in 1890. They had one daughter. Brassey died in February 1918, aged 82, and was succeeded in the earldom by his only son, Thomas.

<doc id="580228" wikidata="Q6306853" url="?curid=580228" title="Julia Wolfe">
<text>Julia Wolfe (born December 18, 1958) is an American composer and professor of music at New York University. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Wolfe&#x27;s music has &quot;long inhabited a terrain of its own, a place where classical forms are recharged by the repetitive patterns of minimalism and the driving energy of rock&quot;. Her work &quot;Anthracite Fields&quot;, an oratorio for chorus and instruments, was awarded the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Music. She has also received the Herb Alpert Award (2015) and was named a MacArthur Fellow (2016).

==Life==
Born in Philadelphia, Wolfe has a twin brother and an older brother. As a teenager, she learned piano but she only began to study music seriously after taking a musicianship class at the University of Michigan, where she received a BA in music and theater as a member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1982. In her early twenties, Wolfe wrote music for an all-female theatre troupe.

On a trip to New York, she became friends with composition students Michael Gordon and David Lang, both of whom had recently attended the Yale School of Music and who encouraged her to apply. She went to Yale in 1984 and studied primarily with Martin Bresnick, and she married Michael Gordon the same year. After receiving her M.M. in 1986, Wolfe, Gordon, and Lang founded the new music collective Bang on a Can in 1987. Bang on a Can is now an organization with a concert series and tours, and a summer festival in the Berkshires for emerging composers and performers. Wolfe, Gordon, and Lang founded Red Poppy Music in 1993 as a printed music publishing company. The three-founded record label Cantaloupe Music in 2001.

Wolfe received a Fulbright Scholarship to travel to Amsterdam in 1992. In 2012, Wolfe received a PhD in composition from Princeton University. She has been a professor of music composition at New York University in the Steinhardt School since 2009, prior to which she was an adjunct professor at the Manhattan School of Music for seven years. In 2015, Wolfe won the Pulitzer Prize for music for her work &quot;Anthracite Fields&quot;, and in 2016 she was named a MacArthur Fellowship recipient. In 2018, she was a recipient of an honorary degree from Drew University in New Jersey. Wolfe held the 2021–22 Richard and Barbara Debs Composer&#x27;s Chair at Carnegie Hall.

Wolfe and Gordon are married and have two children. They live in lower Manhattan.

==Music==
Wolfe has written a major body of work for strings, from quartets to full orchestra. Her quartets, as described by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine &quot;combine the violent forward drive of rock music with an aura of minimalist serenity [using] the four instruments as a big guitar, whipping psychedelic states of mind into frenzied and ecstatic climaxes.&quot; Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Cruel Sister&quot; for string orchestra, inspired by a traditional English ballad of a love rivalry between sisters, was commissioned by the Munich Chamber Orchestra, received its US premiere at the Spoleto Festival USA, and was released (along with her other string orchestra piece, &quot;Fuel&quot;) on Cantaloupe Music. Written shortly after September 11, 2001, her string quartet concerto &quot;My Beautiful Scream&quot;, written for Kronos Quartet and the Orchestre National de France (premiered in the US at the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music under the direction of Marin Alsop), was inspired by the idea of a slow motion scream. &quot;The Vermeer Room&quot;, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, and &quot;Window of Vulnerability&quot; show Wolfe&#x27;s ability to create vivid sonic images. &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, for mixed chamber ensemble and recorded sound, uses a haunting audio landscape that consists of skidding cars and breaking glass. &quot;The Vermeer Room&quot;, inspired by the Vermeer painting &quot;A Girl Asleep&quot;—which when x-rayed reveals a hidden figure—received its orchestral premiere with the San Francisco Symphony. In &quot;Window of Vulnerability&quot;, written for the American Composers Orchestra and conducted by Dennis Russell Davies, Wolfe creates a massive sonic universe of dense textures and fragile windows.

The influence of pop culture can be heard in many of Wolfe&#x27;s works, including &quot;Lick&quot; and &quot;Believing&quot; for the Bang on a Can All-Stars. &quot;Lick&quot;, based on fragments of funk, has become a manifesto for the new generation of pop-influenced composers. The raucous &quot;My Lips From Speaking&quot; for six pianos was inspired by the opening riff of the Aretha Franklin tune &quot;Think&quot;. Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Dark Full Ride&quot; is an obsessive and relentless exploration of the drum set, beginning with an extended hi-hat spotlight, while &quot;Lad&quot; is a piece for nine bagpipes.

Wolfe drew on oral histories, interviews, geography, local rhymes, and coal advertisements for her Pulitzer Prize-winning piece &quot;Anthracite Fields&quot;, an oratorio about the coal mining community of her native Pennsylvania which premiered in Philadelphia and was performed at the New York Philharmonic Biennial in the spring of 2014. In 2015–16, the Bang on a Can All-Stars, with first the Los Angeles Master Chorale and then the Danish Radio Vocal Society, gave &quot;Anthracite Fields&quot; its West Coast and European premieres, and Cantaloupe Music released the studio recording, featuring the Choir of Trinity Wall Street and the Bang on a Can All-Stars.

Wolfe&#x27;s interest in labor history has informed her recent work, including &quot;Steel Hammer&quot;, an evening-length art-ballad that was a finalist for the 2010 Pulitzer Prize. The text is culled from more than 200 versions of the John Henry legend and based on hearsay, recollection, and tall tales that explore the subject of human versus machine. Premiered by the Trio Mediaeval and the Bang on a Can All-Stars, &quot;Steel Hammer&quot; was presented in a fully staged version by director Anne Bogart and her SITI Company at the University of Illinois, UCLA, Virginia Tech, OZ Arts Nashville, and BAM in 2015.

Following her folk interests and the tradition of body percussion in American folk music also led her to compose &quot;riSE and fLY&quot;, a concerto for body percussionist Colin Currie. The piece premiered in 2012 with the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Keith Lockhart, and premiered in the Netherlands with the Codarts Ensemble and the United States with the Albany Symphony Orchestra in the 2014–15 season. &quot;Fire in my mouth&quot;, was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and premiered at David Geffen Hall on January 25, 2019. The piece was based on extensive research into the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. Her most recent piece, unEarth, draws heavily from scientific data surrounding climate change. It was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and premiered at David Geffen Hall on June 1, 2023.

===Music for film and theatre===
Wolfe&#x27;s work with film includes &quot;Fuel&quot; for the Hamburg-based Ensemble Resonanz and filmmaker Bill Morrison, and &quot;Impatience&quot; and &quot;Combat de Boxe&quot; for the Asko/Schönberg Ensemble and 1920s film experimentalist Charles Dekeukeleire.

Wolfe has collaborated with theater artist Anna Deavere Smith, architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, filmmaker Bill Morrison, Ridge Theater, director François Girard, Jim Findlay, and choreographer Susan Marshall, among others. Her music has been heard at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival, Settembre Musica (Italy), Théâtre de la Ville (Paris), Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and Carnegie Hall, and has been recorded on Cantaloupe Music, Teldec, Point/Universal, Sony Classical Records, and Argo/Decca. Wolfe received a 2000 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.

Her music for theatre includes the score for Anna Deavere Smith&#x27;s &quot;House Arrest&quot;, and she won an Obie Award for her score to Ridge Theater&#x27;s &quot;Jennie Richie&quot;. She has composed a series of collaborative multimedia works with composers Michael Gordon and David Lang, including &quot;Lost Objects&quot; (Concerto Köln, directed by François Girard, libretto by Deborah Artman), &quot;Shelter&quot; (musikFabrik, Ridge Theater, libretto by Deborah Artman), and &quot;The Carbon Copy Building&quot; (with comic-book artist Ben Katchor). Wolfe created the citywide spectacle &quot;Traveling Music&quot; with architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro in Bordeaux, France, filling the streets of the old city with 100 musicians walking and riding in pedi-cabs.

===Bang on a Can===
Wolfe is one of the founders and artistic directors of Bang on a Can (alongside fellow composers Michael Gordon and David Lang), best known for its Marathon Concerts during which an eclectic mix of pieces are performed in succession over the course of many hours while audience members are welcome to come and go as they please. For the twentieth anniversary of their Marathon Concerts, Bang on a Can presented twenty-six hours of uninterrupted music at the World Financial Center Winter Garden Atrium in New York City. In 1992, Bang on a Can founded the chamber ensemble Bang on a Can All-Stars.

Among Bang on a Can&#x27;s early events were performances by John Cage, premieres of Glenn Branca’s epic symphonies for massed electric guitars, and fully staged operas by Harry Partch, featuring the composer&#x27;s original instruments.

Wolfe, Gordon, and Lang occasionally collaborate on jointly-composed large-scale staged works, often without revealing which sections each contributed. The opera &quot;The Carbon Copy Building&quot;, is a collaboration with comic book artist Ben Katchor, received the 2000 Village Voice Obie Award for Best New American Work. A projected comic strip accompanies and interacts with the singers, and the frames fall away in the telling of the story. Gordon, Wolfe and Lang have subsequently collaborated with writer Deborah Artman on the &#x27;oratorio&#x27; &quot;Lost Objects&quot;, the recording of which was released in summer 2001 (Teldec New Line).

A further project, &quot;Shelter&quot;, is a multi-media work that was commissioned by the ensemble musikFabrik and features the Scandinavian vocalists Trio Mediaeval in a staged spectacle that, in the words of librettist Deborah Artman, &quot;evokes the power and threat of nature, the soaring frontier promise contained in the framing of a new house, the pure aesthetic beauty of blueprints, the sweet architecture of sound and the uneasy vulnerability that underlies even the safety of our sleep.&quot; Shelter was premiered in Cologne, Germany in spring 2005, and received its US premiere in November 2005.

Both &quot;Shelter&quot; and &quot;Carbon Copy&quot; Building were staged by New York&#x27;s Ridge Theater, in collaboration with Laurie Olinder (visual graphics), Bill Morrison (film-maker) and Bob McGrath (director). In 2017 Chinese singer Gong Linna premiered &quot;Cloud River Mountain,&quot; written by the three Bang on a Can composers in addition to Lao Luo. They also premiere &quot;Road Trip,&quot; a celebration of Bang on a Can&#x27;s 30-year journey, together at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in October 2017.

<text>Absolution is the third studio album by English rock band Muse, released on 22 September 2003 through Taste Media. It was produced by Muse and Rich Costey, with additional production by John Cornfield and Paul Reeve.

Most of the album was recorded at Grouse Lodge in County Westmeath, Ireland, with additional sessions at AIR Studios and Livingston Recording Studios in London and Cello Studios in Los Angeles. Costey wanted to give Muse a bigger, more aggressive sound, and &quot;Absolution&quot; is more polished and direct than their previous albums. It incorporates classical influences, with orchestra on tracks such as &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot; and &quot;Blackout&quot;, and apocalyptic lyrical themes. Muse used effects, synthesisers and software to process many tracks.

&quot;Absolution&quot; reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. It also produced Muse&#x27;s first top-ten single, &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot;, which reached number 8 on the UK singles chart. As of 2018, &quot;Absolution&quot; had sold more than 3.5 million copies worldwide. A 20th anniversary box set was released on 17 November 2023, with remastered audio, unreleased demos and live versions.

==Background==
Muse set aside time to develop their third album, as their previous recording sessions had been rushed. In early 2002, they rented a country house outside Brighton for six months to write material. During this period, they were dropped by their American record label, Maverick. The System of a Down singer, Serj Tankian, attempted to sign Muse to his label, Serjical Strike, but Maverick asked for half a million dollars to release them from their contract and his attempts to have Sony provide the money failed.

Muse decided to focus on Europe, and embarked on the final leg of their tour for their previous album, &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot;, playing the future &quot;Absolution&quot; songs &quot;Hysteria&quot; and &quot;The Small Print&quot;. After the tour, Muse resumed writing and recording demos in an unused commercial loft in Hackney, London.

== Recording ==

Muse began recording in late 2002 with the producers John Cornfield and Paul Reed at Air Studios, London, where they recorded &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot; and &quot;Blackout&quot;. They were joined later by the American producer Rich Costey, who produced the rest of the album. Costey had worked with acts Muse admired, including Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, and wanted to give them a bigger, more aggressive sound. According to Costey, Muse wanted to sound like a &quot;colossal, dynamic, epic and powerful rock band&quot;. 

Muse and Costey returned to Air in late 2002 to work on songs including &quot;Hysteria&quot; and &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;. The songwriter, Matt Bellamy, restructured &quot;Hysteria&quot; after feedback from Costey. For &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;, Costey vocodered Bellamy&#x27;s guitar with a Nord modular synthesiser, creating &quot;hollow, white noisey&quot; sound. Muse and Costey regrouped in early 2003 for 10 days at Livingston Recording Studios, London, completing the recordings they had made at Air. 

Muse moved to Grouse Lodge, a residential recording studio in County Westmeath, Ireland, where most of the album was recorded. The sessions were marred by Muse&#x27;s strained relationship with their record company and a lawsuit with their production company. When Muse&#x27;s co-manager arrived to review their progress, they found him disruptive and threw them out of the studio. Bellamy said later that &quot;there was a genuine sense of impending doom for the band&quot;. The bassist, Chris Wolstenholme, an alcoholic, drank extensively during the sessions.

To create basic tracks, Muse recorded together live, then focused on overdubs. Costey minimised editing to preserve the &quot;human touch&quot; and avoid an artificial result. He added little reverb, preferring to use the natural ambience recorded by the microphones. 

Bellamy used custom Manson guitars and Marshall and Diezel amps. Wolstenholme split his signal into three Marshall amps, one clean and two distorted, and blended the results. For &quot;Fury&quot;, Bellamy used the DigiTech Whammy pedal to rhythmically pitch-shift the guitar riff. Muse and Costey used the sound design system Kyma to process tracks including &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot;, &quot;Hysteria&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Please&quot;. Bellamy said Kyma added an &quot;outrageously hi-fi and bright and futuristic sound&quot;; Costey described it as &quot;the sound of the record&quot;.

The group experimented with drum sounds, using a number of microphones. For the introduction to &quot;Apocalypse Please&quot;, they recorded two kick drums in the Grouse Lodge swimming pool. They also recorded Wolstenholme diving into the pool, which was used in the bridge of &quot;Thoughts of a Dying Atheist&quot;. For &quot;Ruled by Secrecy&quot;, they recorded a drum take in the courtyard outdoors, hoping to capture an unusual ambience, but discarded the results. On &quot;Falling Away with You&quot;, Costey captured the sound of Bellamy&#x27;s fingers on the guitar strings to create an intimate feeling.

For &quot;Sing for Absolution&quot;, Muse used prepared piano, laying metal objects such as nails and guitar strings on the piano strings. They also processed the piano with a pitch-shifting DigiTech Whammy pedal and an Echloplex delay effect. For &quot;Ruled by Secrecy&quot;, they blended piano and a Yamaha CP-80 electric piano. Costey recorded Bellamy&#x27;s left and right-hand parts separately, and ran them through guitar amps and an Echoplex. &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot; was the most difficult song to record; Muse spent hours working on the bass sound for the introduction, processing Wolstenholme&#x27;s bass with multiple effects. Eventually, they used a Roland synthesiser played through a Marshall amp.

&quot;Endlessly&quot; was the last song completed. Muse struggled to improve on the simplicity of Bellamy&#x27;s demo, recorded with a piano and a four-to-the-floor drum machine rhythm. Eventually, they used lighter, jazzier drumming and an old Hammond organ. Later in 2003, Muse and Costey spent three weeks in Cello Studios, Los Angeles. They recorded more overdubs, including the marching sounds that open the album, and the final version of &quot;Endlessly&quot;, and mixed the album. They also attracted interest from American labels and signed a contract with Warner Bros. Records.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Absolution&quot; is an alternative rock, progressive rock, hard rock, and art rock album. It features a more polished and direct sound than Muse&#x27;s previous albums. In 2020, Wolstenholme described it as a continuation of their second album, &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; (2001): &quot;We knew what we wanted to do, and we&#x27;d found our feet a little bit, and we felt comfortable with what we did.&quot;

Bellamy wrote most of the songs on piano, including guitar-based songs such as &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;. For &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot;, he sought to create a heavy rock song using classical piano instead of guitar, with a &quot;mechanical paradiddle thing all the way through&quot;. He was inspired by the &quot;intensive, repetitive&quot; piano compositions of Terry Riley, such as &quot;In C&quot;. &quot;Blackout&quot; uses mandolin and orchestra.

The lyrics incorporate themes of fear, mistrust, personal achievement and joy, and a general theme of &quot;things coming to an end&quot;. Bellamy said that absolution was &quot;not necessarily a religious word; it has meanings of purity, but it&#x27;s not necessarily talking from a Christian or any particular religious point of view. I think it&#x27;s just suggesting that the act of making music is a way of understanding things.&quot; 

The beginning of the Iraq War influenced the songwriting. Bellamy said that the lyrics for &quot;Apocalypse Please&quot; followed naturally from the &quot;epic and in-your-face&quot; chord progression. The end of Muse&#x27;s relationship with their American label, Maverick, also influenced the lyrics. Bellamy became interested in conspiracy theories connected to subjects involving the September 11 attacks, which he described as &quot;good subject matter&quot; for songwriting. He later disavowed conspiracy theories as dangerous.

==Artwork==
&quot;Absolution&quot; is one of two Muse albums (alongside &quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot;) to feature artwork by Storm Thorgerson. The ambiguous falling/floating image is similar to the René Magritte painting &quot;Golconda&quot;. According to Howard, the artwork could be interpreted as depicting people either leaving or descending to Earth.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Absolution&quot; was released on 22 September 2003 on CD and double vinyl. The first single, &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;, was released as a download and was downloaded more than 20,000 times. Because of contractual obligations, Muse could not allow it to be downloaded free, so the fee was set at $0.99 in the US. On tour for &quot;Absolution&quot;, Muse performed in arenas for the first time and headlined Glastonbury Festival in 2004. The tour ended with two sold-out nights at Earls Court, London. Muse also toured the United States, playing in small clubs.

==Critical reception==
On Metacritic, &quot;Absolution&quot; has a score of 72 of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; wrote that its &quot;chaotic choruses feel like the triumphant culmination of some earth-shattering undertaking&quot;, while Andrew Future of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; called it &quot;a truly elemental opus&quot;. Tyler Fisher of &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; felt that &quot;Absolution&quot; was Muse&#x27;s most consistent album to date and that it perfected their sound, writing that it &quot;expands on newer sounds and improves on others&quot;. Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;Muse sound like a band who are at the top of their game. Their confidence carries you through the album&#x27;s excesses.&quot; Rob Kemp of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was less enthusiastic, drawing Radiohead comparisons and concluding that Bellamy &quot;doesn&#x27;t bring as much ingenuity to his singing&quot;.

&quot;Absolution&quot; was Muse&#x27;s first album to chart in the US, and is credited with establishing their fan base there. It was the second Muse album released in the US, after a dispute with Maverick Records had canceled the release of &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; there. &quot;Absolution&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart and No. 107 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified gold in March 2007, becoming Muse&#x27;s first album to be certified in the US. &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot; became Muse&#x27;s first top-10 single on the UK singles chart and was certified gold in the US.

===Legacy===
In 2005, &quot;Absolution&quot; was ranked number 345 in the &quot;Rock Hard&quot; book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Q&quot; readers voted it the 23rd-best British album, and in 2009, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; readers voted it the second-best album of the century so far. 

A remastered 20th-anniversary reissue, &quot;Absolution XX Anniversary&quot;, featuring bonus tracks, live recordings and demos, was released on 17 November 2023. &quot;Clash&quot; wrote that the reissue was not as &quot;neatly constructed or unique&quot; as the 2021 &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; reissue, with &quot;largely dispensable&quot; bonus material, but praised the &quot;punchier, cleaner&quot; remaster.

<doc id="580237" wikidata="Q2569390" url="?curid=580237" title="Movement paradox">
<text>A movement paradox is a phenomenon of grammar that challenges the transformational approach to syntax. The importance of movement paradoxes is emphasized by those theories of syntax (e.g. lexical functional grammar, head-driven phrase structure grammar, construction grammar, most dependency grammars) that reject movement, i.e. the notion that discontinuities in syntax are explained by the movement of constituents.

== Syntactic movement == 
Given a transformational approach to syntax, the following related sentences are explained in terms of movement:

::a. We talked about the fact that he was sick for days.
::b. The fact that he was sick, we talked about ___ for days. 

The underlined noun phrase, which contains a clause, is taken to have moved leftward in the second sentence, the blank marking its starting position. A transformational approach to syntax will explain all sorts of discontinuities (e.g. wh-fronting, topicalization, extraposition, scrambling, inversion, shifting) in this manner in terms of movement.

== Three types of movement paradoxes == 
Movement paradoxes challenge the movement account of discontinuities. They occur when the &quot;moved&quot; constituent is acceptable in its derived position but not in its base position, e.g.

::a. *We talked about that he was sick for days. 
::b. That he was sick, we talked about ___ for days. 

::a. *...but she did not met me. 
::b. ?...but met me she did not ___. 

::a. *I aren&#x27;t your friend. 
::b. Aren&#x27;t I ___ your friend? 

These data are difficult to explain in an analysis based on movement, since it is not evident how the b-sentence can be grammatical each time if it is derived by a movement operation applied to the corresponding a-example. The first example illustrates a movement paradox involving a clausal complement of the preposition &quot;about&quot;, the second a movement paradox involving competing forms of a non-finite verb (&quot;meet&quot; vs &quot;met&quot;), and the third a movement paradox involving a contracted form of the copula (&quot;aren&#x27;t&quot;). To state the problem in other words, the movement analysis of the b-sentences has to explain the unexpected fact that the a-sentences are bad.

== A fourth type of movement paradox ==
Movement paradoxes are present in other languages as well. The so-called &quot;long passive&quot; in German presents a movement paradox that revolves around competing case forms, e.g.



On the assumption that the noun phrase &quot;den Wagen&quot; is in its base position in the a-sentence, this noun phrase must be in a derived position in the other two sentences. The problem is evident in the competing case forms of the determiner (&quot;den&quot; vs. &quot;der&quot;). In the derived position at the front of the sentence, the determiner must appear in the nominative (&quot;der&quot;, not &quot;den&quot;), whereas when this noun phrase appears in its base position, the accusative of the determiner must appear (&quot;den&quot;, not &quot;der&quot;). The paradox is evident in the necessity that a change in case form accompany movement.

<doc id="580238" wikidata="Q1192156" url="?curid=580238" title="Curve of constant width">
<text>In geometry, a curve of constant width is a simple closed curve in the plane whose width (the distance between parallel supporting lines) is the same in all directions. The shape bounded by a curve of constant width is a body of constant width or an orbiform, the name given to these shapes by Leonhard Euler. Standard examples are the circle and the Reuleaux triangle. These curves can also be constructed using circular arcs centered at crossings of an arrangement of lines, as the involutes of certain curves, or by intersecting circles centered on a partial curve.

Every body of constant width is a convex set, its boundary crossed at most twice by any line, and if the line crosses perpendicularly it does so at both crossings, separated by the width. By Barbier&#x27;s theorem, the body&#x27;s perimeter is exactly  times its width, but its area depends on its shape, with the Reuleaux triangle having the smallest possible area for its width and the circle the largest. Every superset of a body of constant width includes pairs of points that are farther apart than the width, and every curve of constant width includes at least six points of extreme curvature. Although the Reuleaux triangle is not smooth, curves of constant width can always be approximated arbitrarily closely by smooth curves of the same constant width.

Cylinders with constant-width cross-section can be used as rollers to support a level surface. Another application of curves of constant width is for coinage shapes, where regular Reuleaux polygons are a common choice. The possibility that curves other than circles can have constant width makes it more complicated to check the roundness of an object.

Curves of constant width have been generalized in several ways to higher dimensions and to non-Euclidean geometry.

==Definitions==
Width, and constant width, are defined in terms of the supporting lines of curves; these are lines that touch a curve without crossing it.
Every compact curve in the plane has two supporting lines in any given direction, with the curve sandwiched between them. The Euclidean distance between these two lines is the &quot;width&quot; of the curve in that direction, and a curve has constant width if this distance is the same for all directions of lines. The width of a bounded convex set can be defined in the same way as for curves, by the distance between pairs of parallel lines that touch the set without crossing it, and a convex set is a body of constant width when this distance is nonzero and does not depend on the direction of the lines. Every body of constant width has a curve of constant width as its boundary, and every curve of constant width has a body of constant width as its convex hull.

Another equivalent way to define the width of a compact curve or of a convex set is by looking at its orthogonal projection onto a line. In both cases, the projection is a line segment, whose length equals the distance between support lines that are perpendicular to the line. So, a curve or a convex set has constant width when all of its orthogonal projections have the same length.

==Examples==

Circles have constant width, equal to their diameter. On the other hand, squares do not: supporting lines parallel to two opposite sides of the square are closer together than supporting lines parallel to a diagonal. More generally, no polygon can have constant width. However, there are other shapes of constant width. A standard example is the Reuleaux triangle, the intersection of three circles, each centered where the other two circles cross. Its boundary curve consists of three arcs of these circles, meeting at 120° angles, so it is not smooth, and in fact these angles are the sharpest possible for any curve of constant width.

Other curves of constant width can be smooth but non-circular, not even having any circular arcs in their boundary.
For instance, the zero set of the polynomial below forms a non-circular smooth algebraic curve of constant width:
:formula_1
Its degree, eight, is the minimum possible degree for a polynomial that defines a non-circular curve of constant width.

==Constructions==

Every regular polygon with an odd number of sides gives rise to a curve of constant width, a Reuleaux polygon, formed from circular arcs centered at its vertices that pass through the two vertices farthest from the center. For instance, this construction generates a Reuleaux triangle from an equilateral triangle. Some irregular polygons also generate Reuleaux polygons. In a closely related construction, called by Martin Gardner the &quot;crossed-lines method&quot;, an arrangement of lines in the plane (no two parallel but otherwise arbitrary) is sorted into cyclic order by the slopes of the lines. The lines are then connected by a curve formed from a sequence of circular arcs; each arc connects two consecutive lines in the sorted order, and is centered at their crossing. The radius of the first arc must be chosen large enough to cause all successive arcs to end on the correct side of the next crossing point; however, all sufficiently-large radii work. For two lines, this forms a circle; for three lines on the sides of an equilateral triangle, with the minimum possible radius, it forms a Reuleaux triangle, and for the lines of a regular star polygon it can form a Reuleaux polygon.

Leonhard Euler constructed curves of constant width from involutes of curves with an odd number of cusp singularities, having only one tangent line in each direction (that is, projective hedgehogs). An intuitive way to describe the involute construction is to roll a line segment around such a curve, keeping it tangent to the curve without sliding along it, until it returns to its starting point of tangency. The line segment must be long enough to reach the cusp points of the curve, so that it can roll past each cusp to the next part of the curve, and its starting position should be carefully chosen so that at the end of the rolling process it is in the same position it started from. When that happens, the curve traced out by the endpoints of the line segment is an involute that encloses the given curve without crossing it, with constant width equal to the length of the line segment. If the starting curve is smooth (except at the cusps), the resulting curve of constant width will also be smooth. An example of a starting curve with the correct properties for this construction is the deltoid curve, and the involutes of the deltoid that enclose it form smooth curves of constant width, not containing any circular arcs.

Another construction chooses half of the curve of constant width, meeting certain requirements, and forms from it a body of constant width having the given curve as part of its boundary. The construction begins with a convex curved arc, whose endpoints are the intended width formula_2 apart. The two endpoints must touch parallel supporting lines at distance formula_2 from each other. Additionally, each supporting line that touches another point of the arc must be tangent at that point to a circle of radius formula_2 containing the entire arc; this requirement prevents the curvature of the arc from being less than that of the circle. The completed body of constant width is then the intersection of the interiors of an infinite family of circles, of two types: the ones tangent to the supporting lines, and more circles of the same radius centered at each point of the given arc. This construction is universal: all curves of constant width may be constructed in this way. Victor Puiseux, a 19th-century French mathematician, found curves of constant width containing elliptical arcs that can be constructed in this way from a semi-ellipse. To meet the curvature condition, the semi-ellipse should be bounded by the semi-major axis of its ellipse, and the ellipse should have eccentricity at most formula_5. Equivalently, the semi-major axis should be at most twice the semi-minor axis.

Given any two bodies of constant width, their Minkowski sum forms another body of constant width. A generalization of Minkowski sums to the sums of support functions of hedgehogs produces a curve of constant width from the sum of a projective hedgehog and a circle, whenever the result is a convex curve. All curves of constant width can be decomposed into a sum of hedgehogs in this way.

==Properties==

A curve of constant width can rotate between two parallel lines separated by its width, while at all times touching those lines, which act as supporting lines for the rotated curve. In the same way, a curve of constant width can rotate within a rhombus or square, whose pairs of opposite sides are separated by the width and lie on parallel support lines. Not every curve of constant width can rotate within a regular hexagon in the same way, because its supporting lines may form different irregular hexagons for different rotations rather than always forming a regular one. However, every curve of constant width can be enclosed by at least one regular hexagon with opposite sides on parallel supporting lines.

A curve has constant width if and only if, for every pair of parallel supporting lines, it touches those two lines at points whose distance equals the separation between the lines. In particular, this implies that it can only touch each supporting line at a single point. Equivalently, every line that crosses the curve perpendicularly crosses it at exactly two points of distance equal to the width. Therefore, a curve of constant width must be convex, since every non-convex simple closed curve has a supporting line that touches it at two or more points. Curves of constant width are examples of self-parallel or auto-parallel curves, curves traced by both endpoints of a line segment that moves in such a way that both endpoints move perpendicularly to the line segment. However, there exist other self-parallel curves, such as the infinite spiral formed by the involute of a circle, that do not have constant width.

Barbier&#x27;s theorem asserts that the perimeter of any curve of constant width is equal to the width multiplied by formula_6. As a special case, this formula agrees with the standard formula formula_7 for the perimeter of a circle given its diameter. By the isoperimetric inequality and Barbier&#x27;s theorem, the circle has the maximum area of any curve of given constant width. The Blaschke–Lebesgue theorem says that the Reuleaux triangle has the least area of any convex curve of given constant width. Every proper superset of a body of constant width has strictly greater diameter, and every Euclidean set with this property is a body of constant width. In particular, it is not possible for one body of constant width to be a subset of a different body with the same constant width. Every curve of constant width can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a piecewise circular curve or by an analytic curve of the same constant width.

A vertex of a smooth curve is a point where its curvature is a local maximum or minimum; for a circular arc, all points are vertices, but non-circular curves may have a finite discrete set of vertices. For a curve that is not smooth, the points where it is not smooth can also be considered as vertices, of infinite curvature. For a curve of constant width, each vertex of locally minimum curvature is paired with a vertex of locally maximum curvature, opposite it on a diameter of the curve, and there must be at least six vertices. This stands in contrast to the four-vertex theorem, according to which every simple closed smooth curve in the plane has at least four vertices. Some curves, such as ellipses, have exactly four vertices, but this is not possible for a curve of constant width. Because local minima of curvature are opposite local maxima of curvature, the only curves of constant width with central symmetry are the circles, for which the curvature is the same at all points. For every curve of constant width, the minimum enclosing circle of the curve and the largest circle that it contains are concentric, and the average of their diameters is the width of the curve. These two circles together touch the curve in at least three pairs of opposite points, but these points are not necessarily vertices.

A convex body has constant width if and only if the Minkowski sum of the body and its 180° rotation is a circular disk; if so, the width of the body is the radius of the disk.

==Applications==

Because of the ability of curves of constant width to roll between parallel lines, any cylinder with a curve of constant width as its cross-section can act as a &quot;roller&quot;, supporting a level plane and keeping it flat as it rolls along any level surface. However, the center of the roller moves up and down as it rolls, so this construction would not work for wheels in this shape attached to fixed axles.

Some coinage shapes are non-circular bodies of constant width. For instance the British 20p and 50p coins are Reuleaux heptagons, and the Canadian loonie is a Reuleaux 11-gon. These shapes allow automated coin machines to recognize these coins from their widths, regardless of the orientation of the coin in the machine. On the other hand, testing the width is inadequate to determine the roundness of an object, because such tests cannot distinguish circles from other curves of constant width. Overlooking this fact may have played a role in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the roundness of sections of the rocket in that launch was tested only by measuring widths, and off-round shapes may cause unusually high stresses that could have been one of the factors causing the disaster.

==Generalizations==
The curves of constant width can be generalized to certain non-convex curves, the curves that have two tangent lines in each direction, with the same separation between these two lines regardless of their direction. As a limiting case, the projective hedgehogs (curves with one tangent line in each direction) have also been called &quot;curves of zero width&quot;.

One way to generalize these concepts to three dimensions is through the surfaces of constant width. The three-dimensional analog of a Reuleaux triangle, the Reuleaux tetrahedron, does not have constant width, but minor changes to it produce the Meissner bodies, which do. The curves of constant width may also be generalized to the bodies of constant brightness, three-dimensional shapes whose two-dimensional projections all have equal area; these shapes obey a generalization of Barbier&#x27;s theorem. A different class of three-dimensional generalizations, the space curves of constant width, are defined by the properties that each plane that crosses the curve perpendicularly intersects it at exactly one other point, where it is also perpendicular, and that all pairs of points intersected by perpendicular planes are the same distance apart.

Curves and bodies of constant width have also been studied in non-Euclidean geometry and for non-Euclidean normed vector spaces.

<text>A Reuleaux triangle is a curved triangle with constant width, the simplest and best known curve of constant width other than the circle. It is formed from the intersection of three circular disks, each having its center on the boundary of the other two. Constant width means that the separation of every two parallel supporting lines is the same, independent of their orientation. Because its width is constant, the Reuleaux triangle is one answer to the question &quot;Other than a circle, what shape can a manhole cover be made so that it cannot fall down through the hole?&quot;

They are named after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German engineer who pioneered the study of machines for translating one type of motion into another, and who used Reuleaux triangles in his designs. However, these shapes were known before his time, for instance by the designers of Gothic church windows, by Leonardo da Vinci, who used it for a map projection, and by Leonhard Euler in his study of constant-width shapes. Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, fire hydrant nuts, pencils, and drill bits for drilling filleted square holes, as well as in graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.

Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux triangle has the minimum area and the sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and is closely related to the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover a small fraction of the square&#x27;s area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.

The Reuleaux triangle is the first of a sequence of Reuleaux polygons whose boundaries are curves of constant width formed from regular polygons with an odd number of sides. Some of these curves have been used as the shapes of coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into three dimensions in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant width, but can be modified by rounding its edges to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does. Alternatively, the surface of revolution of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width.

== Construction ==

The Reuleaux triangle may be constructed either directly from three circles, or by rounding the sides of an equilateral triangle.

The three-circle construction may be performed with a compass alone, not even needing a straightedge. By the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem
the same is true more generally of any compass-and-straightedge construction, but the construction for the Reuleaux triangle is particularly simple.
The first step is to mark two arbitrary points of the plane (which will eventually become vertices of the triangle), and use the compass to draw a circle centered at one of the marked points, through the other marked point. Next, one draws a second circle, of the same radius, centered at the other marked point and passing through the first marked point.
Finally, one draws a third circle, again of the same radius, with its center at one of the two crossing points of the two previous circles, passing through both marked points. The central region in the resulting arrangement of three circles will be a Reuleaux triangle.

Alternatively, a Reuleaux triangle may be constructed from an equilateral triangle &quot;T&quot; by drawing three arcs of circles, each centered at one vertex of &quot;T&quot; and connecting the other two vertices.
Or, equivalently, it may be constructed as the intersection of three disks centered at the vertices of &quot;T&quot;, with radius equal to the side length of &quot;T&quot;.

== Mathematical properties ==

The most basic property of the Reuleaux triangle is that it has constant width, meaning that for every pair of parallel supporting lines (two lines of the same slope that both touch the shape without crossing through it) the two lines have the same Euclidean distance from each other, regardless of the orientation of these lines. In any pair of parallel supporting lines, one of the two lines will necessarily touch the triangle at one of its vertices. The other supporting line may touch the triangle at any point on the opposite arc, and their distance (the width of the Reuleaux triangle) equals the radius of this arc.

The first mathematician to discover the existence of curves of constant width, and to observe that the Reuleaux triangle has constant width, may have been Leonhard Euler. In a paper that he presented in 1771 and published in 1781 entitled &quot;De curvis triangularibus&quot;, Euler studied curvilinear triangles as well as the curves of constant width, which he called orbiforms.

=== Extremal measures ===
By many different measures, the Reuleaux triangle is one of the most extreme curves of constant width.

By the Blaschke–Lebesgue theorem, the Reuleaux triangle has the smallest possible area of any curve of given constant width. This area is
:formula_1
where &quot;s&quot; is the constant width. One method for deriving this area formula is to partition the Reuleaux triangle into an inner equilateral triangle and three curvilinear regions between this inner triangle and the arcs forming the Reuleaux triangle, and then add the areas of these four sets. At the other extreme, the curve of constant width that has the maximum possible area is a circular disk, which has area formula_2.

The angles made by each pair of arcs at the corners of a Reuleaux triangle are all equal to 120°. This is the sharpest possible angle at any vertex of any curve of constant width. Additionally, among the curves of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.
Although the Reuleaux triangle has sixfold dihedral symmetry, the same as an equilateral triangle, it does not have central symmetry.
The Reuleaux triangle is the least symmetric curve of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas on either side of a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.

Among all shapes of constant width that avoid all points of an integer lattice, the one with the largest width is a Reuleaux triangle. It has one of its axes of symmetry parallel to the coordinate axes on a half-integer line. Its width, approximately 1.54, is the root of a degree-6 polynomial with integer coefficients.

Just as it is possible for a circle to be surrounded by six congruent circles that touch it, it is also possible to arrange seven congruent Reuleaux triangles so that they all make contact with a central Reuleaux triangle of the same size. This is the maximum number possible for any curve of constant width.
Among all quadrilaterals, the shape that has the greatest ratio of its perimeter to its diameter is an equidiagonal kite that can be inscribed into a Reuleaux triangle.

=== Other measures ===
By Barbier&#x27;s theorem all curves of the same constant width including the Reuleaux triangle have equal perimeters. In particular this perimeter equals the perimeter of the circle with the same width, which is formula_3.

The radii of the largest inscribed circle of a Reuleaux triangle with width &quot;s&quot;, and of the circumscribed circle of the same triangle, are
:formula_4
respectively; the sum of these radii equals the width of the Reuleaux triangle. More generally, for every curve of constant width, the largest inscribed circle and the smallest circumscribed circle are concentric, and their radii sum to the constant width of the curve.
The optimal packing density of the Reuleaux triangle in the plane remains unproven, but is conjectured to be
:formula_5
which is the density of one possible double lattice packing for these shapes. The best proven upper bound on the packing density is approximately 0.947. It has also been conjectured, but not proven, that the Reuleaux triangles have the highest packing density of any curve of constant width.

=== Rotation within a square ===

Any curve of constant width can form a rotor within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and at all times touching all four sides of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square&#x27;s vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.

At any point during this rotation, two of the corners of the Reuleaux triangle touch two adjacent sides of the square, while the third corner of the triangle traces out a curve near the opposite vertex of the square. The shape traced out by the rotating Reuleaux triangle covers approximately 98.8% of the area of the square.

=== As a counterexample ===
Reuleaux&#x27;s original motivation for studying the Reuleaux triangle was as a counterexample, showing that three single-point contacts may not be enough to fix a planar object into a single position. The existence of Reuleaux triangles and other curves of constant width shows that diameter measurements alone cannot verify that an object has a circular cross-section.

In connection with the inscribed square problem, observed that the Reuleaux triangle provides an example of a constant-width shape in which no regular polygon with more than four sides can be inscribed, except the regular hexagon, and he described a small modification to this shape that preserves its constant width but also prevents regular hexagons from being inscribed in it. He generalized this result to three dimensions using a cylinder with the same shape as its cross section.

== Applications ==

=== Reaching into corners ===
Several types of machinery take the shape of the Reuleaux triangle, based on its property of being able to rotate within a square.

The Watts Brothers Tool Works square drill bit has the shape of a Reuleaux triangle, modified with concavities to form cutting surfaces. When mounted in a special chuck which allows for the bit not having a fixed centre of rotation, it can drill a hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal holes.

Panasonic&#x27;s RULO robotic vacuum cleaner has its shape based on the Reuleaux triangle in order to ease cleaning up dust in the corners of rooms.

=== Rolling cylinders ===

Another class of applications of the Reuleaux triangle involves cylindrical objects with a Reuleaux triangle cross section. Several pencils are manufactured in this shape, rather than the more traditional round or hexagonal barrels. They are usually promoted as being more comfortable or encouraging proper grip, as well as being less likely to roll off tables (since the center of gravity moves up and down more than a rolling hexagon).

A Reuleaux triangle (along with all other curves of constant width) can roll but makes a poor wheel because it does not roll about a fixed center of rotation. An object on top of rollers that have Reuleaux triangle cross-sections would roll smoothly and flatly, but an axle attached to Reuleaux triangle wheels would bounce up and down three times per revolution. This concept was used in a science fiction short story by Poul Anderson titled &quot;The Three-Cornered Wheel&quot;. A bicycle with floating axles and a frame supported by the rim of its Reuleaux triangle shaped wheel was built and demonstrated in 2009 by Chinese inventor Guan Baihua, who was inspired by pencils with the same shape.

=== Mechanism design ===

Another class of applications of the Reuleaux triangle involves using it as a part of a mechanical linkage that can convert rotation around a fixed axis
into reciprocating motion. These mechanisms were studied by Franz Reuleaux. With the assistance of the Gustav Voigt company, Reuleaux built approximately 800 models of mechanisms, several of which involved the Reuleaux triangle. Reuleaux used these models in his pioneering scientific investigations of their motion. Although most of the Reuleaux–Voigt models have been lost, 219 of them have been collected at Cornell University, including nine based on the Reuleaux triangle. However, the use of Reuleaux triangles in mechanism design predates the work of Reuleaux; for instance, some steam engines from as early as 1830 had a cam in the shape of a Reuleaux triangle.

One application of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, it is necessary to advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for a fraction of a second in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film&#x27;s motion while the frame is projected.

The rotor of the Wankel engine is shaped as a curvilinear triangle that is often cited as an example of a Reuleaux triangle. However, its curved sides are somewhat flatter than those of a Reuleaux triangle and so it does not have constant width.

=== Architecture ===

In Gothic architecture, beginning in the late 13th century or early 14th century, the Reuleaux triangle became one of several curvilinear forms frequently used for windows, window tracery, and other architectural decorations. For instance, in English Gothic architecture, this shape was associated with the decorated period, both in its geometric style of 1250–1290 and continuing into its curvilinear style of 1290–1350. It also appears in some of the windows of the Milan Cathedral. In this context, the shape is sometimes called a &quot;spherical triangle&quot;, which should not be confused with spherical triangle meaning a triangle on the surface of a sphere. In its use in Gothic church architecture, the three-cornered shape of the Reuleaux triangle may be seen both as a symbol of the Trinity, and as &quot;an act of opposition to the form of the circle&quot;.

The Reuleaux triangle has also been used in other styles of architecture. For instance, Leonardo da Vinci sketched this shape as the plan for a fortification. Modern buildings that have been claimed to use a Reuleaux triangle shaped floorplan include the MIT Kresge Auditorium, the Kölntriangle, the Donauturm, the Torre de Collserola, and the Mercedes-Benz Museum. However in many cases these are merely rounded triangles, with different geometry than the Reuleaux triangle.

=== Mapmaking ===

Another early application of the Reuleaux triangle, da Vinci&#x27;s world map from circa 1514, was a world map in which the spherical surface of the earth was divided into eight octants, each flattened into the shape of a Reuleaux triangle.
Similar maps also based on the Reuleaux triangle were published by Oronce Finé in 1551 and by John Dee in 1580.

=== Other objects ===

Many guitar picks employ the Reuleaux triangle, as its shape combines a sharp point to provide strong articulation, with a wide tip to produce a warm timbre. Because all three points of the shape are usable, it is easier to orient and wears less quickly compared to a pick with a single tip.
The Reuleaux triangle has been used as the shape for the cross section of a fire hydrant valve nut. The constant width of this shape makes it difficult to open the fire hydrant using standard parallel-jawed wrenches; instead, a wrench with a special shape is needed. This property allows the fire hydrants to be opened only by firefighters (who have the special wrench) and not by other people trying to use the hydrant as a source of water for other activities.
Following a suggestion of , the antennae of the Submillimeter Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are arranged on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the antennae on a curve of constant width causes the observatory to have the same spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform of the signal from the array. The antennae may be moved from one Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired angular resolution of each observation. The precise placement of the antennae on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory departs from the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.

=== Signs and logos ===
The shield shapes used for many signs and corporate logos feature rounded triangles. However, only some of these are Reuleaux triangles.

The corporate logo of Petrofina (Fina), a Belgian oil company with major operations in Europe, North America and Africa, used a Reuleaux triangle with the Fina name from 1950 until Petrofina&#x27;s merger with &quot;Total S.A.&quot; (today TotalEnergies) in 2000.
Another corporate logo framed in the Reuleaux triangle, the south-pointing compass of Bavaria Brewery, was part of a makeover by design company Total Identity that won the SAN 2010 Advertiser of the Year award. The Reuleaux triangle is also used in the logo of Colorado School of Mines.

In the United States, the National Trails System and United States Bicycle Route System both mark routes with Reuleaux triangles on signage.

=== In nature ===

According to Plateau&#x27;s laws, the circular arcs in two-dimensional soap bubble clusters meet at 120° angles, the same angle found at the corners of a Reuleaux triangle. Based on this fact, it is possible to construct clusters in which some of the bubbles take the form of a Reuleaux triangle.

The shape was first isolated in crystal form in 2014 as Reuleaux triangle disks. Basic bismuth nitrate disks with the Reuleaux triangle shape were formed from the hydrolysis and precipitation of bismuth nitrate in an ethanol–water system in the presence of 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine.

== Generalizations ==
Triangular curves of constant width with smooth rather than sharp corners may be obtained as the locus of points at a fixed distance from the Reuleaux triangle. Other generalizations of the Reuleaux triangle include surfaces in three dimensions, curves of constant width with more than three sides, and the Yanmouti sets which provide extreme examples of an inequality between width, diameter, and inradius.

=== Three-dimensional version === 

The intersection of four balls of radius &quot;s&quot; centered at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron with side length &quot;s&quot; is called the Reuleaux tetrahedron, but its surface is not a surface of constant width. It can, however, be made into a surface of constant width, called Meissner&#x27;s tetrahedron, by replacing three of its edge arcs by curved surfaces, the surfaces of rotation of a circular arc. Alternatively, the surface of revolution of a Reuleaux triangle through one of its symmetry axes forms a surface of constant width, with minimum volume among all known surfaces of revolution of given constant width.

=== Reuleaux polygons ===
The Reuleaux triangle can be generalized to regular or irregular polygons with an odd number of sides, yielding a Reuleaux polygon, a curve of constant width formed from circular arcs of constant radius. The constant width of these shapes allows their use as coins that can be used in coin-operated machines. Although coins of this type in general circulation usually have more than three sides, a Reuleaux triangle has been used for a commemorative coin from Bermuda.

Similar methods can be used to enclose an arbitrary simple polygon within a curve of constant width, whose width equals the diameter of the given polygon. The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the polygon), can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be drawn with compass and straightedge. Although the Reuleaux polygons all have an odd number of circular-arc sides, it is possible to construct constant-width shapes with an even number of circular-arc sides of varying radii.

=== Yanmouti sets ===
The Yanmouti sets are defined as the convex hulls of an equilateral triangle together with three circular arcs, centered at the triangle vertices and spanning the same angle as the triangle, with equal radii that are at most equal to the side length of the triangle. Thus, when the radius is small enough, these sets degenerate to the equilateral triangle itself, but when the radius is as large as possible they equal the corresponding Reuleaux triangle. Every shape with width &quot;w&quot;, diameter &quot;d&quot;, and inradius &quot;r&quot; (the radius of the largest possible circle contained in the shape) obeys the inequality
:formula_6
and this inequality becomes an equality for the Yanmouti sets, showing that it cannot be improved.

In the classical presentation of a three-set Venn diagram as three overlapping circles, the central region (representing elements belonging to all three sets) takes the shape of a Reuleaux triangle. The same three circles form one of the standard drawings of the Borromean rings, three mutually linked rings that cannot, however, be realized as geometric circles. Parts of these same circles are used to form the triquetra, a figure of three overlapping semicircles (each two of which form a vesica piscis symbol) that again has a Reuleaux triangle at its center; just as the three circles of the Venn diagram may be interlaced to form the Borromean rings, the three circular arcs of the triquetra may be interlaced to form a trefoil knot.

Relatives of the Reuleaux triangle arise in the problem of finding the minimum perimeter shape that encloses a fixed amount of area and includes three specified points in the plane. For a wide range of choices of the area parameter, the optimal solution to this problem will be a curved triangle whose three sides are circular arcs with equal radii. In particular, when the three points are equidistant from each other and the area is that of the Reuleaux triangle, the Reuleaux triangle is the optimal enclosure.

Circular triangles are triangles with circular-arc edges, including the Reuleaux triangle as well as other shapes.
The deltoid curve is another type of curvilinear triangle, but one in which the curves replacing each side of an equilateral triangle are concave rather than convex. It is not composed of circular arcs, but may be formed by rolling one circle within another of three times the radius. Other planar shapes with three curved sides include the arbelos, which is formed from three semicircles with collinear endpoints, and the Bézier triangle.

The Reuleaux triangle may also be interpreted as the stereographic projection of one triangular face of a spherical tetrahedron, the Schwarz triangle of parameters formula_7 with spherical angles of measure formula_8 and sides of spherical length

<text>Frank Warren Snepp, III (born May 3, 1943) is an American journalist and former chief analyst of North Vietnamese strategy for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Saigon during the Vietnam War. For five out of his eight years as a CIA officer, he worked as interrogator, agent debriefer, and chief strategy analyst in the United States Embassy, Saigon; he was awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit for his work. Snepp is a former producer for KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, California. He was one of the first whistle blowers who revealed the inner workings, secrets and failures of the national security services in the 1970s. As a result of a loss in a 1980 court case brought by the CIA, all of Snepp&#x27;s publications require prior approval by the CIA.

==Background==
Born in Kinston, North Carolina, Snepp studied Elizabethan literature at Columbia University, graduating in 1965. After spending a year at CBS News, he returned to Columbia&#x27;s School of International and Public Affairs, from which he graduated in 1968.

==Career==

===CIA (1968–1976)===
Snepp was recruited to the CIA in 1968, by the Associate Dean of the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, Philip Mosely. Initially working on NATO and European security, he was sent to Saigon in 1969. Here Snepp worked as an analyst and counter-intelligence officer, coordinating agent networks and interrogation of captured enemy forces as well as preparing strategic estimates regarding the enemy. Snepp rejected the usual 2-year rotation, and stayed in Vietnam until the US was forced out in 1975. Snepp wrote in 2009 that he was &quot;still haunted&quot; by the &quot;psychological manipulation and torment of a prisoner&quot; he was involved with as a CIA interrogator.

Snepp was on hand for the Fall of Saigon and was one of the last Americans to leave the US Embassy, Saigon before the city fell to the North Vietnamese on April 30, 1975. Snepp was evacuated with other American personnel in Operation Frequent Wind. On his return to the US Snepp was awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit in December 1975, but he resigned from the Agency in January 1976, upset at its refusal to rescue Vietnamese left behind in the pull-out, and its refusal to acknowledge mistakes made.

===Memoir===
Snepp wrote a memoir, &quot;Decent Interval&quot;, about the evacuation of US personnel from Saigon. It was published in 1977 without prior approval from the CIA Publications Review Board. Prior to publication, and while still employed at the CIA, Snepp attempted to tell the inspector general about the problems surrounding the evacuation, but was told that it &quot;could not deal with anything so controversial&quot;.

After the book was published, CIA Director Stansfield Turner pushed for Snepp to be sued and, despite the objections of some Department of Justice officials, Turner prevailed. Since publication of the book could not be stopped under the constitutional law forbidding prior restraint of the press, the CIA sued Snepp for breach of contract. Snepp was accused of violating the non-disclosure agreement he had signed when he joined the agency that forbade publication of any material about CIA operations without the prior consent of the agency. Ironically, President Jimmy Carter permitted the lawsuit against Snepp at the same time he had proposed the creation of a special unit to provide protection for civil service whistle blowers. In a press conference, Carter said that Snepp did not qualify as a whistleblower as he did not &quot;reveal anything that would lead to an improvement in our security apparatus or the protection of Americans&#x27; civil rights.&quot; Carter also claimed that Snepp had &quot;revealed our nation&#x27;s utmost secrets&quot;, a charge which was not part of the government&#x27;s suit.

Snepp enlisted the help of the American Civil Liberties Union in his defense. The CIA won a court verdict against Snepp, with the US Supreme Court ruling that Snepp&#x27;s book had caused &quot;irreparable harm&quot; to national security due to creating an appearance of a breakdown of discipline in the CIA. The royalties from &quot;Decent Interval&quot; (amounting to $300,000 by the time Snepp lost in front of the Supreme Court) were surrendered to the CIA, and Snepp forced to clear all future publications with the CIA. Snepp described the court decision as a &quot;ticking time-bomb&quot; which exploded when the cigarette manufacturer Brown &amp; Williamson used the precedent to force CBS not to air an interview with whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand.

In 2001 Snepp published a second book, &quot;Irreparable Harm&quot;, about his court battle with the CIA.

===Journalism (1980–present)===
In 1980, following the Supreme Court decision against him, Snepp became an investigative journalist, contributing to publications including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Village Voice&quot; and others. 

During the late 1980s, he taught a Journalism and the Law course at California State University, Long Beach. He was a technical consultant for the comedy film &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; and was interviewed on his Vietnam War experiences for Ken Burns&#x27;s series &quot;The Vietnam War and &quot;. 

Snepp worked in television for ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot; (1987–92), CBS (2003–05) and NBC from 2005. At &quot;World News Tonight&quot; he got Eugene Hasenfus to confirm that he had signed a government secrecy agreement, confirming the government&#x27;s involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.

Snepp won an Emmy Award in 1997 for an investigation into Mexican drug trafficking. He won a Peabody Award in 2006 as producer on an investigation for KNBC-TV-Los Angeles of a Los Angeles housing development sited on a toxic landfill.

Snepp sued KNBC-TV for age discrimination after he was dismissed from his job in 2012. A jury deadlocked in 2015, and the case was settled in March 2016.

<doc id="580264" wikidata="Q1188048" url="?curid=580264" title="Barbier's theorem">
<text>In geometry, Barbier&#x27;s theorem states that every curve of constant width has perimeter  times its width, regardless of its precise shape. This theorem was first published by Joseph-Émile Barbier in 1860.

==Examples==
The most familiar examples of curves of constant width are the circle and the Reuleaux triangle. For a circle, the width is the same as the diameter; a circle of width &quot;w&quot; has perimeter &quot;w&quot;. A Reuleaux triangle of width &quot;w&quot; consists of three arcs of circles of radius &quot;w&quot;. Each of these arcs has central angle /3, so the perimeter of the Reuleaux triangle of width &quot;w&quot; is equal to half the perimeter of a circle of radius &quot;w&quot; and therefore is equal to &quot;w&quot;. A similar analysis of other simple examples such as Reuleaux polygons gives the same answer.

==Proofs==
One proof of the theorem uses the properties of Minkowski sums. If &quot;K&quot; is a body of constant width &quot;w&quot;, then the Minkowski sum of &quot;K&quot; and its 180° rotation is a disk with radius &quot;w&quot; and perimeter 2&quot;w&quot;. The Minkowski sum acts linearly on the perimeters of convex bodies, so the perimeter of &quot;K&quot; must be half the perimeter of this disk, which is &quot;w&quot; as the theorem states.

Alternatively, the theorem follows immediately from the Crofton formula in integral geometry according to which the length of any curve equals the measure of the set of lines that cross the curve, multiplied by their numbers of crossings. Any two curves that have the same constant width are crossed by sets of lines with the same measure, and therefore they have the same length. Historically, Crofton derived his formula later than, and independently of, Barbier&#x27;s theorem.

An elementary probabilistic proof of the theorem can be found at Buffon&#x27;s noodle.

==Higher dimensions==
The analogue of Barbier&#x27;s theorem for surfaces of constant width is false. In particular, the unit sphere has surface area formula_1, while the surface of revolution of a Reuleaux triangle with the same constant width has surface area formula_2.

Instead, Barbier&#x27;s theorem generalizes to bodies of constant brightness, three-dimensional convex sets for which every two-dimensional projection has the same area. These all have the same surface area as a sphere of the same projected area.

And in general, if formula_3 is a convex subset of formula_4, for which every (&quot;n&quot;−1)-dimensional projection has area of the unit ball in formula_5, then the surface area of formula_3 is equal to that of the unit sphere in formula_4. This follows from the general form of Crofton formula.

<text>Robert Kelly Thomas (born February 14, 1972) is an American musician. He is the lead vocalist for the Florida-based alternative rock band Matchbox Twenty, which he formed in 1995 and with whom he has released five studio albums. As a solo act, he is best known for his guest performance on Santana&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Smooth&quot;, which won three Grammy Awards, peaked the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and in 2018, was named the second-most successful song in the chart&#x27;s history. His 2005 single, &quot;Lonely No More&quot; was his first to be released as a lead solo artist. It peaked at number six on the chart and led his debut solo album, &quot;...Something to Be&quot; (2005), which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

As part of Matchbox Twenty, Thomas has written and performed their string of commercially successful singles, including &quot;Push&quot;, &quot;3AM&quot;, &quot;Real World&quot;, &quot;Back 2 Good&quot;, &quot;Bent&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, &quot;Mad Season&quot;, &quot;Disease&quot;, &quot;Unwell&quot;, &quot;Bright Lights&quot;, &quot;How Far We&#x27;ve Come&quot;, and &quot;She&#x27;s So Mean&quot;. Thomas has also been a credited songwriter for other artists including Willie Nelson, Mick Jagger, Marc Anthony, Pat Green, Taylor Hicks, Travis Tritt, and Daughtry. In 2004, the Songwriters Hall of Fame gave Thomas its first Hal David Starlight Award, which recognizes young songwriters.

==Early life==
Thomas was born in Landstuhl, Germany, at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center to Bill Thomas, a United States Army sergeant, and Mamie. 
 Thomas has an elder half sister, Melissa, from his mother&#x27;s previous marriage. The family returned to the United States when Thomas was six months old. His parents divorced when he was two years old. Thomas lived with his mother and sister. They were poor and moved frequently, often staying with Mamie&#x27;s mother in Lake City, South Carolina. His grandmother was an alcoholic. She owned a small country store and gas station, where she also sold moonshine and marijuana under the counter. He grew up listening to country music and idolized the &quot;big stars who lived ... hard lives&quot;, like Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard. Their stories inspired him to be a songwriter.

Thomas and his mother and sister moved to Sarasota, Florida, when he was 10, then settled in the Orlando area the following year. Around this time, Thomas received his first musical instrument, a Casio keyboard. A friend taught him to play, and Thomas practiced by trying to reproduce the songs he heard on the radio. He also acquired a guitar with no strings, which he used as a prop while he pretended he was in a rock band.

His home life was not stable. Thomas describes his mother as an alcoholic who occasionally beat him. When Thomas was 12, his mother was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma and given only six months to live. His sister ran away from home to get married, leaving Thomas to care for their mother on his own. She eventually entered remission. Mamie dated a series of men, some of whom beat her, and she loved wild parties. Thomas sometimes woke up to find &quot;10 strangers sleeping off last night&#x27;s booze-a-thon in the living room&quot;.

He attended Lake Brantley High School in the Orlando suburb of Altamonte Springs. Thomas joined the choir in an unsuccessful attempt to attract the attention of a girl that he liked. His choir teacher told him to keep working, because he saw potential in him. To impress girls at parties, Thomas wrote and played music.

A few months before graduation, Thomas dropped out of high school, saying his &quot;regular life was in such disarray that going seemed ridiculous&quot;. He later earned a GED. He was convicted of stealing a Camaro and spent two months in county jail when he was 17. For the next two or three years, Thomas was homeless. Occasionally he&#x27;d stay for a few days or weeks at the homes of various friends. At other times, he would hitchhike around Florida and South Carolina.

Soon after getting out of jail, Thomas connected with several local musicians. He played in a series of cover bands and began writing songs in earnest. Thomas said that &quot;in songwriting I felt special for the first time. And all I wanted to do was get out of Florida.&quot; One of his bands, Fair Warning, earned a three-week job playing at a hotel in Vero Beach. They were fired three days into the job, after they were caught stealing beer and candy from the hotel. He was, at one point, a member of another band, Tidal Wave, which played mostly surf tunes.

Thomas used drugs, and during one acid trip, he decided to play with dry ice. His hands were burned so badly that doctors initially thought they would require amputation. Thomas&#x27; sister recalled that while she was concerned with how Thomas would manage everyday activities, Thomas cried and asked, &quot;How am I going to get these songs in my head out if I can&#x27;t play them?&quot;

==Career==
===1993–1995: Formation of Matchbox 20===
In 1993, Thomas formed the band Tabitha&#x27;s Secret. Brian Yale was the group&#x27;s bass player. Paul Doucette earned a spot as drummer after answering an ad. Guitarists Jay Stanley and John Goff rounded out the band. The band was popular in the Orlando area, where they played in bars and nightclubs. Most of their songs were written by Thomas, including &quot;3 A.M.&quot; This song, inspired by his time taking care of his mother, was the first that he had ever written and liked. In an effort to recreate that magic, his writing shifted to focus more on emotions inspired from his own life.

Producer Matt Serletic heard them play and was intrigued. The band met him for an introductory meeting, but broke up before any contracts were signed. Thomas worried that he&#x27;d never get another chance for a recording contract. Thomas, Yale, and Doucette were still interested in working together, and Serletic introduced them to rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor and lead guitarist Kyle Cook; together, they formed a new band, Matchbox 20. Serletic sent Thomas to vocal coach Jan Smith to learn how to refine his vocal power.

The band recorded several demo tapes, with Serletic as their producer. Three radio stations in Orlando and Tampa added the songs to their rotations. Executives at Atlantic Records noticed that the songs were being requested frequently. Although the band sounded very green, executives thought the songs were good. The band was soon signed to Atlantic subsidiary Lava Records.

===1996–1998: &quot;Yourself or Someone Like You&quot;===
Thomas wrote every song on Matchbox 20&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Yourself or Someone Like You&quot;. It was released in October 1996, on the same day that Lava Records folded. The album sold only 600 copies in its first week. The band toured extensively, trying to attract notice. Radio stations were slow to adopt their first single, &quot;Long Day&quot;. Thomas and his bandmates were convinced they were soon to be dropped from their contract. Their manager was also worried, and yelled at them to get serious about their performances.

Their fears were well-founded. Officials at Atlantic were close to dropping the band when they noticed that sales had spiked in Birmingham, Alabama. There, radio stations had begun playing another track on the album, &quot;Push&quot;. Atlantic released &quot;Push&quot; as a single, and it soon became a Top 5 hit. Its success led the album to be certified gold. Their next single, &quot;3 A.M.&quot;, was hugely popular, and the album went multi-platinum. &quot;Real World&quot;, and &quot;Back 2 Good&quot; followed.

Nearly seven months after its release, the album reached number 99 on the Billboard 200 chart. It continued to climb, finally reaching as high as number 5. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award and two American Music Awards. In 1997, readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Matchbox 20 the best new band.

Thomas enjoyed his success. When travelling, he&#x27;d tell customs officials that his occupation was &quot;rock star&quot;, and he often dressed the part, wearing sunglasses and long furry coats. He&#x27;s described the first few years with Matchbox 20 as a blur, featuring large quantities of alcohol, cocaine, and sexual relationships with women. One of those interludes resulted in a son.

The constant partying took a toll on Thomas and the band. Thomas concedes that the shows were beginning to suffer. He gained more than . The weight gain earned them their first mention in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;—an item making fun of Thomas. The band members decided together that they wanted to be more professional and began cleaning themselves up. Cocaine use was no longer tolerated. In 1998, Thomas was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People.

===1999: &quot;Smooth&quot;===
In 1999, Latin guitarist Carlos Santana began putting together his comeback album, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, a series of duets. He was looking for one last song to complete the album. Songwriter Itaal Shur had given a demo tape to Santana&#x27;s representatives. Although they liked the music, they thought the lyrics and melody could be strengthened. One of the executives sent the demo to Thomas, asking him if he&#x27;d like to work on it.

Thomas had never worked on a song that he didn&#x27;t intend to perform, and he was interested in the opportunity to try something new. He wrote the song intending for it to be sung by George Michael.

Thomas wrote the verses to the song that became &quot;Smooth&quot;, and he and Shur collaborated on the chorus. He was inspired both by his wife, who is half-Spanish and half-Puerto-Rican, and by Santana himself. When he finished the song, he was unsure whether it was any good. His wife listened to the demo and told him, &quot;This is going to be huge.&quot; Santana heard the demo and said he couldn&#x27;t determine at first whether it was a male or female singing. He had no idea who Thomas was, but he liked the voice and asked that Thomas sing on the record. When they first met, Santana asked Thomas if he was married to a Latin woman.

The song was recorded live, in three takes. Thomas was not aware that it was going to be released as a single until he heard it on the radio. It was a massive hit, spending 58 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Billboard&quot; later named it the number 2 Hot 100 song of all time. It won three Grammy Awards, for Best Record, Best Song, and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Its success earned him instant credibility as a songwriter. BMI named Thomas its 1999 Pop Songwriter of the Year for &quot;Smooth&quot; and his Matchbox 20 songs. &quot;Smooth&quot; would ultimately become the second biggest-selling single of all time, after Chubby Checker&#x27;s &quot;The Twist.&quot;

&quot;Smooth&quot; increased his visibility, and that of Matchbox 20. The song&#x27;s video, starring Thomas, was played extensively on VH1 and MTV. That exposure launched him out of anonymity. A new set of listeners, older than the band&#x27;s initial fan base, was exposed to, and liked, Thomas&#x27;s work. &quot;Yourself or Someone Like You&quot; continued to sell briskly. After winning at the Grammy Awards, Atlantic took out ads in many industry publications to make executives aware that Thomas had written not only &quot;Smooth&quot;, but also all of the songs on the Matchbox 20 album. Ron Shapiro, an executive at Atlantic, said, &quot;It was our intent to get Rob and this band a substantial amount of credibility.&quot;

Thomas says that &quot;Smooth&quot; &quot;really opened up the door for me as a songwriter and a solo artist.&quot;

===2000–2003: &quot;Mad Season&quot; and &quot;More Than You Think You Are&quot;===
As Matchbox 20 prepared to record their second album, band members had heated discussions over song selection. After flirting with the idea of allowing other band members to provide songs, they chose to record only songs that Thomas had written or co-written. They renamed themselves Matchbox Twenty and, in March 2000, released &quot;Mad Season&quot;. Its first single, &quot;Bent&quot;, reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; it remains the band&#x27;s only number one hit, despite larger commercial success on previous material. Their tour took them to 87 cities, and they sold out Madison Square Garden in 15 minutes.

Thomas was inducted into the South Carolina Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2001.

When Santana prepared to record his follow-up to &quot;Supernatural&quot;, he sought to collaborate with Thomas again. Instead of providing vocals, Thomas wrote two songs for the album, which were recorded by Seal and Musiq. Thomas provided songs to other artists as well. Willie Nelson recorded three of Thomas&#x27;s songs on his 2002 album &quot;The Great Divide&quot;. One of those, &quot;Recollection Phoenix&quot;, had been in contention for the next Matchbox Twenty album before the other band members had decided it wasn&#x27;t a good fit.

The third Matchbox Twenty album, &quot;More Than You Think You Are&quot;, wasn&#x27;t complete until four weeks before its release date, November 19, 2002. For the first time, the band recorded a song not written by Thomas. Two other songs were jointly attributed to Thomas, Cook, and Doucette. As part of the promotion for the album, Thomas and his bandmates were featured on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;. When the tour for &quot;More Than You Think You Are&quot; ended, Thomas, Cook, Doucette, Yale, and Gaynor decided to take a break to focus on their families.

In June 2004, the Songwriters Hall of Fame gave Thomas the inaugural Hal David Starlight Award, which recognizes a young songwriter who has made an outsized impression on the industry.

===2004–2007: &quot;...Something to Be&quot; and &quot;Exile on Mainstream&quot;===
On April 19, 2005, Thomas began his solo career with the release of &quot;...Something to Be&quot; which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The album included several songs that the other Matchbox Twenty members had rejected, such as &quot;I Am An Illusion&quot;. The album was more pop than Thomas&#x27;s Matchbox Twenty work, adding quirks like sampling and loops. It earned two Grammy nominations, for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.

His first single from the album, &quot;Lonely No More&quot;, reached number six on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The single debuted in the top 10 of the Australian ARIA singles chart on the week of April 4, 2005. The second single, &quot;This Is How a Heart Breaks&quot;, went gold in the US and hit the top 50 in Australia. The third single, &quot;Ever the Same&quot;, became a top five Adult Contemporary hit.

On October 5, 2005, he started his first solo tour, the Something to Be Tour. In the summer of 2006, Thomas toured with Jewel and Toby Lightman. In September 2006, Thomas&#x27;s solo effort received more exposure when ABC started using the song &quot;Streetcorner Symphony&quot; in promotional ads for its popular Thursday night lineup. This song was subsequently released as a single.

In January 2007, Thomas released a single entitled &quot;Little Wonders&quot; from the soundtrack to the Disney animated feature, &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;. &quot;Little Wonders&quot; reached No. 5 on the Mediabase Hot Adult Contemporary chart. Thomas was featured on the June 14, 2007, episode of the long-running PBS series &quot;Soundstage&quot;.

Thomas reunited with his Matchbox Twenty bandmates in 2007. Gaynor had left the band, leaving only four of them. They decided to release a greatest hits album, &quot;Exile on Mainstream&quot;, which included an additional six new songs. The album released three singles: &quot;How Far We&#x27;ve Come&quot;, &quot;All Your Reasons&quot;, and &quot;These Hard Times&quot;. The album debuted at number 3.

===2009–2011: &quot;Cradlesong&quot;===
On September 15, 2008, Thomas told &quot;Billboard&quot; his second solo album was tentatively called &quot;Cradle Songs&quot;. Thomas characterized the album as &quot;the usual mish-mosh of styles, but hopefully just holding true to a bunch of good songs.&quot; The article also mentioned that the record would nonetheless feature several tracks that &quot;take a more global, rhythmic direction after working with South American and African percussionists.&quot; Thomas explained one such experiment:

We started off with the idea of doing a newer version of (Paul Simon&#x27;s) &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot;, and that kinda carried us a long way through. It gave us a whole new bed to work with, like &#x27;How do I get my pop sensibility around this and work it into that?&#x27; It was a lot of fun. But you go through different phases when you&#x27;re writing; it took a different turn, and I just followed it, too.

On March 2, 2009, Clark Collis of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; interviewed Thomas, where he confirmed he had since shelved his initial efforts to evoke &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot;, and claimed the album was scheduled for a June 30 release. Having played half the forthcoming album to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, it was reported that many of the lyrics on &quot;Cradlesong&quot; were about troubled relationships, and three more song titles were revealed: &quot;Meltdown&quot; (described as &quot;INXS-esque power pop&quot; that stood out as &quot;a possible first single&quot;), &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot; (an &quot;epic, tribal drum-driven&quot; track inspired by Dave Eggers&#x27; book &quot;What Is the What&quot;) and &quot;Getting Late&quot; (suggested as the &quot;set&#x27;s likely closer&quot; and what Thomas described as &quot;a little ditty about death.&quot;).

On March 11, 2009, Rob Thomas created his own Twitter account and announced via the social application that &quot;Her Diamonds&quot; would be the lead single from &quot;Cradlesong&quot;.

Thomas has also stated via Twitter that &quot;Cradlesong&quot; had been mastered and featured fourteen tracks culled from the twenty-four songs recorded during the album sessions. All twenty-four tracks were fully mixed and mastered, leaving plenty of material left over for B-sides, iTunes, or EPs.

On June 9, 2009, Thomas released &quot;Give Me the Meltdown&quot; to the US iTunes Store. Similarly, &quot;Someday&quot; was released on June 16. On June 22, &quot;Cradlesong&quot; was made available for streaming only on the we7 website, one week ahead of its UK release date.

Thomas promoted the album with his 2009/2010 tour, Cradlesong Tour.

In March 2010, Thomas announced plans to release a four-song digital-only EP entitled the &quot;Someday EP&quot;. Featuring three new songs, the EP was released to iTunes on March 30, 2010, and all other digital retailers April 6, 2010.

===2012–2014: &quot;North&quot;===
After his solo success, many of Thomas&#x27;s confidants urged him to leave Matchbox Twenty. As Thomas wrapped up his tour for &quot;Cradlesong&quot;, he began writing songs for consideration for the next Matchbox Twenty album. He gathered in Nashville, Tennessee, with his bandmates to narrow down the work he had already done and develop new material. The group members disagreed on which musical direction the new album should take. For three months, they argued and drank, in what Thomas describes as a &quot;$100,000 bender&quot;. Finally, producer Serletic appeared and told them to stop drinking and get to work. The lecture worked. The result was a true collaboration. For the first time, the band recorded several songs written solely by Doucette and Yale.

Matchbox Twenty&#x27;s next album, &quot;North&quot;, was released on September 4, 2012, ten years after their last full-length album of new material. It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart.

===2015–present: &quot;The Great Unknown&quot;, &quot;Chip Tooth Smile&quot;, and &quot;Something About Christmas Time&quot;===
Thomas performed several new album tracks in early 2015: &quot;Hold On Forever&quot;, &quot;Great Unknown&quot;, and &quot;Heaven Help Me&quot;. Thomas released the first single from &quot;The Great Unknown&quot;, &quot;Trust You&quot;, on May 25, 2015. &quot;The Great Unknown&quot; was released on August 21, 2015. He spent two years touring it prior. &quot;Hold on Forever&quot; was announced as the album&#x27;s second single on September 28. The tour for Thomas&#x27; album included holographic representations of Thomas produced with vntana technology so that fans could pose for photos with him during the concert.

Thomas announced on February 15, 2019, that his fourth studio album—titled &quot;Chip Tooth Smile&quot;—would be released on April 26, 2019. The lead single for the album, &quot;One Less Day (Dying Young)&quot;, was released on February 20, 2019.

On October 7, 2021, Thomas announced that his first Christmas studio album titled &quot;Something About Christmas Time&quot; will be released on October 22. He recorded the album, which will include both original and cover songs, in his home studio in New York during the summer.
Matchbox Twenty got back together for &quot;Where the Light Goes&quot; album in May 2023, which is being toured in 2024 

==Artistry==
===Music and voice===
After spending more than 20 years as part of Matchbox Twenty and more than 10 years working on solo material, Thomas has become adept at navigating the &quot;identity crisis&quot; of two separate musical worlds. Although he does play some Matchbox Twenty songs during his solo tours, they are always reimagined, often as an acoustic version.

As a solo artist, Thomas is known for &quot;emotive radio hits&quot;. His solo albums have a much stronger pop feel. His album, &quot;The Great Unknown&quot;, was &quot;unabashed pop&quot;.

His detractors say the music is fluff and too sweet.

===Songwriting===
Thomas writes all of the time, saying &quot;it&#x27;s a lot easier to come up with ideas than it is to edit them.&quot;

Thomas admits that his songs have &quot;a radio sensibility&quot;. He writes songs that he hopes people will like and does not strive to follow or set trends. In his opinion, this is the reason that he has maintained his career; the music never sounds dated. Each of his songs can stand alone without special effects; Thomas wants his listeners to feel the message of a song even if he is just playing it by himself on an acoustic guitar.

Initially, Thomas tried to write epic love songs, in the vein of Lionel Richie. He did not like most of those attempts. After he finished &quot;3 A.M.&quot;, which was inspired by his mother&#x27;s battle with cancer, Thomas realized that he ought to focus on events in his own life. Many of his later songs are inspired by his wife and her battle with an autoimmune disease.

Lisa Rockman, music reviewer for the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, wrote, &quot;There is a reason millions of fans across the world relate to lyrics penned by Rob Thomas. His words come from the heart.&quot;

Thomas chooses his words carefully, &quot;trying to make my phrases more colourful when I&#x27;m writing, trying to find the longest way to get to the point that I&#x27;m trying to make as opposed to the quickest way.&quot;

As his career has progressed, Thomas has more frequently collaborated with other songwriters in order to &quot;keep things fresh and not feel like I&#x27;m going back to the same well and just writing the same songs over and over and over&quot;. In 2021 he admitted his songs come to him the same way, and his confidence as a writer comes and goes and he does not want to rip himself off. He describes himself as an &quot;emotional dude&quot;.

==Personal life==
A mutual friend introduced him to model Marisol Maldonado at an afterparty in Montreal in late 1997. They both claim it was love at first sight. Thomas said that, &quot;I knew the second I kissed her that I would never, ever kiss another person.&quot; As he was in the midst of an international tour, their initial courtship was via phone. Maldonado was at first reluctant to date Thomas, unsure if she could handle being the wife of a rock star. When he returned to the United States, they went on their first date, to a music festival in Boston. That night, he told her he would marry her, and a month later he proposed. They were married on October 2, 1999, at manager Michael Lippman&#x27;s ranch in California. Their wedding was broadcast on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Weddings in Style&quot;. They reside in Bedford, New York.

Thomas has a son, Maison Thomas Eudy, from a previous relationship, born on July 10, 1998. Maison is credited as a songwriter for Thomas&#x27;s song &quot;I Love It&quot; from his 2019 album &quot;Chip Tooth Smile&quot;.

===Charity work===
The Thomases are committed animal lovers and supporters of animal charities. Thomas and his wife have established the Sidewalk Angels Foundation, a non-profit organization created to help needy people in and around America&#x27;s big cities by partnering with various charities to assist people who cannot afford medical care, and animals that have been abandoned or abused.

===Political views===
Politically, Thomas considers himself a &quot;fairly liberal guy&quot;. He is a strong supporter of gay rights and wrote a piece in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. He closed the article by writing, &quot;Each of us has a short ride on this earth and as long as we stay in our lane, and don&#x27;t affect someone else&#x27;s ride, we should be allowed to drive as we see fit.&quot;

| Best Solo Career 


==Television==
Thomas appeared on the American sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; in its fourth season, in which he played himself as a deranged patient of a rehabilitation center. He also served as an advisor for Cee-Lo Green&#x27;s team during the third season of the NBC reality competition series &quot;The Voice&quot;.

Thomas has noted that he is sometimes mistaken for television writer Rob Thomas, and vice versa. A conversation between the two men on this subject led to Thomas agreeing to perform a musical number as himself in the season two finale of the TV show &quot;iZombie&quot;, penned by his namesake. He and his wife were devoted fans of the show. Thomas was killed in the episode.

He performed on NBC’s Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting Concert on November 29, 2023. His 2021 song, A New York Christmas, was chosen because it centers on compassion, understanding and peace.

<text>Wood fuel (or fuelwood) is a fuel such as firewood, charcoal, chips, sheets, pellets, and sawdust. The particular form used depends upon factors such as source, quantity, quality and application. In many areas, wood is the most easily available form of fuel, requiring no tools in the case of picking up dead wood, or few tools, although as in any industry, specialized tools, such as skidders and hydraulic wood splitters, have been developed to mechanize production. Sawmill waste and construction industry by-products also include various forms of lumber tailings. About half of wood extracted from forests worldwide is used as fuelwood.

The discovery of how to make fire for the purpose of burning wood is regarded as one of humanity&#x27;s most important advances. The use of wood as a fuel source for heating is much older than civilization and is assumed to have been used by Neanderthals. Today, burning of wood is the largest use of energy derived from a solid fuel biomass. Wood fuel can be used for cooking and heating, and occasionally for fueling steam engines and steam turbines that generate electricity. Wood may be used indoors in a furnace, stove, or fireplace, or outdoors in furnace, campfire, or bonfire.

==Historical development==

Wood has been used as fuel for millennia. Historically, it was limited in use only by the distribution of technology required to make a spark. Heat derived from wood is still common throughout much of the world. Early examples included a fire constructed inside a tent. Fires were constructed on the ground, and a smoke hole in the top of the tent allowed the smoke to escape by convection.

In permanent structures and in caves, hearths were constructed or established—surfaces of stone or another noncombustible material upon which a fire could be built. Smoke escaped through a smoke hole in the roof.

In contrast to civilizations in relatively arid regions (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt), the Greeks, Romans, Celts, Britons, and Gauls all had access to forests suitable for using as fuel. Over the centuries there was a partial deforestation of climax forests and the evolution of the remainder to coppice with standards woodland as the primary source of wood fuel. These woodlands involved a continuous cycle of new stems harvested from old stumps, on rotations between seven and thirty years. 

One of the earliest printed books on woodland management, in English, was John Evelyn&#x27;s &quot;Sylva, or a discourse on forest trees&quot; (1664) advising landowners on the proper management of forest estates. H. L. Edlin, in &quot;Woodland Crafts in Britain&quot;, 1949 outlines the extraordinary techniques employed, and range of wood products that have been produced from these managed forests since pre-Roman times. And throughout this time the preferred form of wood fuel was the branches of cut coppice stems bundled into faggots. Larger, bent or deformed stems that were of no other use to the woodland craftsmen were converted to charcoal.

As with most of Europe, these managed woodlands continued to supply their markets right up to the end of World War Two. Since then much of these woodlands have been converted to broadscale agriculture. Total demand for fuel increased considerably with the Industrial Revolution but most of this increased demand was met by the new fuel source coal, which was more compact and more suited to the larger scale of the new industries.

During the Edo period of Japan, wood was used for many purposes, and the consumption of wood led Japan to develop a forest management policy during that era. Demand for timber resources was on the rise not only for fuel, but also for construction of ships and buildings, and consequently deforestation was widespread. As a result, forest fires occurred, along with floods and soil erosion. Around 1666, the shōgun made it a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. This policy decreed that only the shōgun, or a &quot;daimyō&quot;, could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about silviculture and plantation forestry.

==Fireplaces and stoves==
The development of the chimney and the fireplace allowed for more effective exhaustion of the smoke. Masonry heaters or stoves went a step further by capturing much of the heat of the fire and exhaust in a large thermal mass, becoming much more efficient than a fireplace alone.

The metal stove was a technological development concurrent with the Industrial Revolution. Stoves were manufactured or constructed pieces of equipment that contained the fire on all sides and provided a means for controlling the draft—the amount of air allowed to reach the fire. Stoves have been made of a variety of materials. Cast iron is among the more common. Soapstone (talc), tile, and steel have all been used. Metal stoves are often lined with refractory materials such as firebrick, since the hottest part of a woodburning fire will burn away steel over the course of several years&#x27; use.

The Franklin stove was developed in the United States by Benjamin Franklin. More a manufactured fireplace than a stove, it had an open front and a heat exchanger in the back that was designed to draw air from the cellar and heat it before releasing it out the sides. The heat exchanger was never a popular feature and was omitted in later versions. So-called &quot;Franklin&quot; stoves today are made in a great variety of styles, though none resembles the original design.
The 1800s became the high point of the cast iron stove. Each local foundry would make their own design, and stoves were built for myriads of purposes—parlour stoves, box stoves, camp stoves, railroad stoves, portable stoves, cooking stoves and so on. Elaborate nickel and
chrome edged models took designs to the edge, with cast ornaments, feet and doors. Wood or coal could be burnt in the stoves and
thus they were popular for over one hundred years. The action of the fire, combined with the causticity of the ash, ensured that the stove would eventually disintegrate or crack over time. Thus a steady supply of stoves was needed. The maintenance of stoves, needing to be blacked, their smokiness, and the need to split wood meant that oil or electric heat found favour.

The airtight stove, originally made of steel, allowed greater control of combustion, being more tightly fitted than other stoves of the day. Airtight stoves became common in the 19th century.

Use of wood heat declined in popularity with the growing availability of other, less labor-intensive fuels. Wood heat was gradually replaced by coal and later by fuel oil, natural gas and propane heating except in rural areas with available forests.

After the 1967 Oil Embargo, many people in the United States used wood as fuel for the first time. The EPA provided information on clean stoves, which burned much more efficiently.

==1970s==

A brief resurgence in popularity occurred during and after the 1973 energy crisis, when some believed that fossil fuels would become so expensive as to preclude their use. A period of innovation followed, with many small manufacturers producing stoves based on designs old and new. Notable innovations from that era include the Ashley heater, a thermostatically controlled stove with an optional perforated steel enclosure that prevented accidental contact with hot surfaces. The decade also saw a number of dual-fuel furnaces and boilers made, which utilized ductwork and piping to deliver heat throughout a house or other building.

==1980s==

The growth in popularity of wood heat also led to the development and marketing of a greater variety of equipment for cutting, splitting and processing firewood. Consumer grade hydraulic log splitters were developed to be powered by electricity, gasoline, or PTO of farm tractors. In 1987 the US Department of Agriculture published a method for producing kiln dried firewood, on the basis that better heat output and increased combustion efficiency can be achieved with logs containing lower moisture content.

The magazine &quot;Wood Burning Quarterly&quot; was published for several years before changing its name to &quot;Home Energy Digest&quot; and, subsequently, disappearing.
== Today ==

A pellet stove is an appliance that burns compressed wood or biomass pellets.
Wood heat continues to be used in areas where firewood is abundant. For serious attempts at heating, rather than mere ambience (open fireplaces), stoves, fireplace inserts, and furnaces are most commonly used today. In rural, forested parts of the U.S., freestanding boilers are increasingly common. They are installed outdoors, some distance from the house, and connected to a heat exchanger in the house using underground piping. 

The mess of wood, bark, smoke, and ashes is kept outside and the risk of fire is reduced. The boilers are large enough to hold a fire all night and can burn larger pieces of wood, thus less cutting and splitting is required. There is no need to retrofit a chimney in the house. However, outdoor wood boilers emit more wood smoke and associated pollutants than other wood-burning appliances. This is due to design characteristics such as the water-filled jacket surrounding the firebox, which acts to cool the fire and leads to incomplete combustion. Outdoor wood boilers also typically have short stack heights in comparison to other wood-burning appliances, contributing to ambient levels of particulates at ground level. An increasingly popular alternative is the wood gasification boiler, which burns wood at very high efficiencies (85-91%) and can be placed indoors or in an outbuilding. 

There are numerous ways to process wood fuel, and wood is still used today for cooking in many places, either in a stove or an open fire. It is also used as a fuel in many industrial processes, including smoking meat and making maple syrup. As a sustainable energy source, wood fuel also remains viable for generating electricity in areas with easy access to forest products and by-products.

==Measurement of firewood==

In the metric system, firewood is normally sold by the cubic metre or stere (1 m3 ≈ 0.276 cords).

In the United States and Canada, firewood is usually sold by the cord, 128 ft3 (3.62 m3), corresponding to a woodpile 8 ft wide × 4 ft high of 4 ft-long logs. The cord is legally defined by statute in most U.S. states. A &quot;thrown cord&quot; is firewood that has not been stacked and is defined as 4 ft wide × 4 ft tall × 10 ft long. The additional volume is to make it equivalent to a standard stacked cord, where there is less void space. It is also common to see wood sold by the &quot;face cord&quot;, which is usually &quot;not&quot; legally defined, and varies from one area to another. For example, in one state a pile of wood 8 feet wide × 4 feet high of 16 inch-long logs will often be sold as a &quot;face cord&quot;, though its volume is only one-third of a cord. In another state, or even another area of the same state, the volume of a face cord may be considerably different. Hence, it is risky to buy wood sold in this manner, as the transaction is not based on a legally enforceable unit of measure.

In Australia, firewood is normally sold by the tonne, but is commonly advertised as sold by the barrowload (wheelbarrow), bucket ( of a 1 m3 bucket of a typical skid-steer), ute-load or bag (roughly 15–20 kg).

==Energy content==

A common hardwood, red oak, has an energy content (heat value) of 14.9 megajoules per kilogram (6,388 BTU per pound), and 10.4 megajoules recoverable if burned at 70% efficiency.

The Sustainable Energy Development Office (SEDO), part of the Government of Western Australia states that the energy content of wood is 16.2 megajoules per kilogram (4.5 kWh/kg).

According to &quot;The Bioenergy Knowledge Centre&quot;, the energy content of wood is more closely related to its moisture content than its species. The energy content improves as moisture content decreases.

In 2008, wood for fuel cost $15.15 per 1 million BTUs (0.041 EUR per kWh).

==Environmental impacts==
===Combustion by-products===
As with any fire, burning wood fuel creates numerous by-products, some of which may be useful (heat and steam), and others that are undesirable, irritating or dangerous.

One by-product of wood burning is wood ash, which in moderate amounts is a fertilizer (mainly potash), contributing minerals, but is strongly alkaline as it contains potassium hydroxide (lye). Wood ash can also be used to manufacture soap.

Smoke, containing water vapor, carbon dioxide and other chemicals and aerosol particulates, including caustic alkali fly ash, which can be an irritating (and potentially dangerous) by-product of partially burnt wood fuel. A major component of wood smoke is fine particles that may account for a large portion of particulate air pollution in some regions. During cooler months, wood heating accounts for as much as 60% of fine particles in Melbourne, Australia.

Significant quantities of volatile organic compounds are released from the combustion of fuel wood. Large quantities of smaller oxygenate species are released during the combustion process, as well as organics formed from the depolymerisation reaction of lignin such as phenolics, furans and furanones. The combustion of fuel wood has also been shown to release many organic compounds into the aerosol phase. The burning of fuel woods has been shown to release organic components over a range of volatilities, over effective saturation concentrations, &quot;C&quot;*, from 101-1011 μg m−3. The emissions from fuel wood samples collected from the Delhi area of India were shown to be 30 times more reactive with the hydroxyl radical than emissions from liquefied petroleum gas. Furthermore, when comparing 21 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emitted from the same fuel wood samples from Delhi, emissions from fuel wood were around 20 times more toxic than emissions from liquefied petroleum gas.

In some of the most efficient burners, the temperature of the smoke is hot enough to burn itself (e.g. for igniting carbon monoxide gas). This may significantly reduce smoke hazards while also providing additional heat from the process. By using a catalytic converter, the temperature for obtaining cleaner smoke can be reduced. Some U.S. jurisdictions prohibit sale or installation of stoves that do not incorporate catalytic converters.

==== Combustion by-product effects on human health ====

Depending on population density, topography, climatic conditions and combustion equipment used, wood heating may substantially contribute to air pollution, particularly particulates. The conditions in which wood is burnt will greatly influence the content of the emission. Particulate air pollution can contribute to human health problems and increased hospital admissions for asthma &amp; heart diseases.

The technique of compressing wood pulp into pellets or artificial logs can reduce emissions. The combustion is cleaner, and the increased wood density and reduced water content can eliminate some of the transport bulk. The fossil energy consumed in transport is reduced and represents a small fraction of the fossil fuel consumed in producing and distributing heating oil or gas.

=== Harvesting operations ===
Much wood fuel comes from native forests around the world. Plantation wood is rarely used for firewood, as it is more valuable as timber or wood pulp, however, some wood fuel is gathered from trees planted amongst crops, also known as agroforestry. The collection or harvesting of this wood can have serious environmental implications for the collection area. The concerns are often specific to the particular area, but can include all the problems that regular logging create. The heavy removal of wood from forests can cause habitat destruction and soil erosion.
However, in many countries, for example in Europe and Canada, the forest residues are being collected and turned into useful wood fuels with minimal impact on the environment. Consideration is given to soil nutrition as well as erosion.
The environmental impact of using wood as a fuel depends on how it is burnt. Higher temperatures result in more complete combustion and less noxious gases as a result of pyrolysis. Some may regard the burning of wood from a sustainable source as carbon-neutral. A tree, over the course of its lifetime, absorbs as much carbon (or carbon dioxide) as it releases when burnt.

Some firewood is harvested in &quot;woodlots&quot; managed for that purpose, but in heavily wooded areas it is more often harvested as a byproduct of natural forests. Deadfall that has not started to rot is preferred, since it is already partly seasoned. Standing dead timber is considered better still, as it is both seasoned, and has less rot. Harvesting this form of timber reduces the speed and intensity of bushfires. Harvesting timber for firewood is normally carried out by hand with chainsaws. Thus, longer pieces - requiring less manual labor, and less chainsaw fuel - are less expensive and only limited by the size of their firebox. Prices also vary considerably with the distance from wood lots, and quality of the wood.
Firewood usually relates to timber or trees unsuitable for building or construction. Firewood is a renewable resource provided the consumption rate is controlled to sustainable levels. The shortage of suitable firewood in some places has seen local populations damaging huge tracts of bush possibly leading to further desertification.

===Greenhouse gases===
Wood burning creates more atmospheric CO2 than biodegradation of wood in a forest (in a given period) because by the time the bark of a dead tree has rotted, the log has already been occupied by other plants and micro-organisms which continue to sequester the CO2 by integrating the hydrocarbons of the wood into their life cycle. Wood harvesting and transport operations produce varying degrees of greenhouse gas pollution. Inefficient and incomplete combustion of wood can result in elevated levels of greenhouse gases other than CO2, which may result in positive emissions where the byproducts have greater Carbon dioxide equivalent values. 

In an attempt to provide quantitative information about the relative output of CO2 to produce electricity or domestic heating, the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has published a comprehensive model comparing the burning of wood (wood chip) and other fuels, based on 33 scenarios. The model&#x27;s output is kilogram of CO2 produced per megawatt-hour (MWh) of delivered energy. Scenario 33 for example, which concerns the production of heat from wood chips produced from UK small roundwood produced from bringing neglected broadleaf forests back into production, shows that burning oil releases of CO2 while burning woodchips releases of CO2 per MWh of delivered energy. However, in scenario 32 of that same reference, which concerns the production of heat from wood chips that would otherwise be made into particleboard, showed that only of CO2 per MWh was released. Therefore, the relative greenhouse effects of biomass energy production are dependent on the usage model.

The intentional and controlled charring of wood and its incorporation into the soil is an effective method for carbon sequestration as well as an important technique to improve soil conditions for agriculture, particularly in heavily forested regions. It forms the basis of the rich soils known as Terra preta.

=== Regulation and Legislation ===
The environmental impact of burning wood fuel is debatable. Several cities have moved towards setting standards of use and/or bans of wood burning fireplaces. For example, the city of Montréal, Québec passed a resolution to ban wood fireplace installation in new construction. 

Wood burning advocates claim that properly harvested wood is carbon-neutral, therefore off-setting the negative impact of by-product particles given off during the burning process. In the context of forest wildfires, wood removed from the forest setting for use as wood fuel can reduce overall emissions by decreasing the quantity of open burned wood and the severity of the burn while combusting the remaining material under regulated conditions. On March 7, 2018, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill that would delay for three years the
implementation of more stringent emission standards for new residential wood heaters.

==Usage==

Some European countries produce a significant fraction of their electricity needs from wood or wood wastes. In Scandinavian countries the costs of manual labor to process firewood is very high. Therefore, it is common to import firewood from countries with cheap labor and natural resources. The main exporters to Scandinavia are the Baltic countries (Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia). In Finland, there is a growing interest in using wood waste as fuel for home and industrial heating, in the form of compacted pellets.

Many lower- and middle-income countries rely on wood for energy purposes (notably cooking). The largest producers are all in these income groups and have large populations with a high reliance on wood for energy: in 2021, India ranked first with 300 million m&quot;³&quot; (15 percent of total production), followed by China with 156 million m3 and Brazil with 129 million m&quot;³&quot; (8 percent and 7 percent of global production).

In the United States, wood fuel is the second-leading form of renewable energy (behind hydro-electric).

===Australia===

About 1.5 million households in Australia use firewood as the main form of domestic heating. As of 1995, approximately 1.85 million cubic metres of firewood (1m³ equals approximately one car trailer load) was used in Victoria annually, with half being consumed in Melbourne. This amount is comparable to the wood consumed by all of Victoria&#x27;s sawlog and pulplog forestry operations (1.9 million m³).

Species used as sources of firewood include:
*Red Gum, from forests along the Murray River (the Mid-Murray Forest Management Area, including the Barmah and Gunbower forests, provides about 80% of Victoria&#x27;s red gum timber).
*Box and Messmate Stringybark, in southern Australia.
*Sugar gum, a wood with high thermal efficiency that usually comes from small plantations.
*Jarrah, in the Southwest of Western Australia. It generates a greater heat than most other available woods and is usually sold by the tonne.

===Europe===
In 2014, the construction of the biggest pellet plant in the Baltic region was started in Võrumaa, Sõmerpalu, Estonia, with an expected output of 110,000 tons of pellet / year. Different types of wood will be used in the process of pellet making (firewood, woodchips, shavings). The Warmeston OÜ plant started its activity by the end of 2014.
In 2013, the main pellet consumers in Europe were the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Belgium, as U.E.&#x27;s annual report on biofuels states. In Denmark and Sweden, pellets are used by power plants, households and medium scale consumers for district heating, compared to Austria and Italy, where pellets are mainly used as small - scale private residential and industrial boilers for heating. The UK is the single largest consuming market for industrial wood pellets, in large part due to its major biomass-fueled power stations such as Drax, MGT and Lynemouth.

=== Asia ===
Japan and South Korea are both growing markets for industrial wood pellets, and as of 2017, were expected to become the second and third largest global markets for wood pellets due to government policies favoring the use of biomass in power generation.

=== North America ===
Demand for wood fuel in the United States is principally driven by residential and commercial heating customers. Canada was not a major consumer of industrial wood pellets as of 2017, but has relatively aggressive de-carbonization policies and may become a significant consumer of industrial wood pellets by the 2020s.
