<text>CKY (abbreviation of Camp Kill Yourself) is an American rock band from West Chester, Pennsylvania, formed in 1998 by vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg and drummer Jess Margera. In 2011, Miller left the band which has since continued with Margera and Ginsburg, along with touring bassist Ronnie Elvis James who began performing with the band in 2023. Since Miller&#x27;s departure in 2011, Ginsburg has taken over as frontman. Miller has since reformed pre-CKY group Foreign Objects (which originally included Margera) and founded 96 Bitter Beings, his own continuance of the material he previously played with CKY.

CKY initially found mainstream recognition through its contributions to the &quot;CKY&quot; video series and &quot;Jackass&quot; TV series, both of which featured Margera&#x27;s brother Bam. After the release of their debut album &quot;Volume 1&quot; in 1999, CKY signed with Island/Def Jam and issued &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild&quot; in 2002, which gave the band its first experience of US chart success. In 2005 the album &quot;An Answer Can Be Found&quot; followed, after which the group signed with Roadrunner Records and released &quot;Carver City&quot; in 2009. Miller left the band in 2011, after which Ginsburg, Margera and bassist Matt Deis released &quot;The Phoenix&quot; on Entertainment One Music in 2017.

CKY has been categorized in various genres, including alternative rock/metal, post-grunge, stoner rock and hard rock. The band&#x27;s songwriting in the past was typically led by Miller, with production, engineering and mixing handled by Ginsburg.

==History==
===1998–2001: Formation and early releases===

Deron Miller and Jess Margera originally met at high school in 1992 and later formed the band Foreign Objects together, releasing &quot;The Undiscovered Numbers &amp; Colors&quot; in 1995. Within a year, the pair had moved onto playing in a band named Oil, which featured live bassist Andy Smith and later Ryan Bruni, releasing the EPs &quot;Lifelines&quot; and &quot;Oil&quot; in 1996 and 1997, respectively. The trio met Chad I Ginsburg, who was then working as an audio engineer, during recording sessions for their planned debut full-length album, and later enlisted him to finalize the first lineup of Camp Kill Yourself, a name which Miller conceived as &quot;a perfect title for a horror movie&quot;. The first name Miller proposed for the band was I Dismember Mama, after the 1972 horror film of the same name. Ginsburg had previously performed in the band Rudy &amp; Blitz, which had signed with Columbia Records sub-label Ruffhouse in 1995 and recorded an album, though it was not released.
The band recorded its debut album between November 1997 and February 1998 at The Ground Hog Studio in Holland, Pennsylvania. Speaking about the recording process to Guitar.com, Miller explained that the whole album took around two years to finish, mainly due to financial challenges, and that the writing process totalled up to four years. Many of the sessions were funded by the frontman&#x27;s father. The music&#x27;s first exposure came in one of Bam Margera&#x27;s early stunt videos, &quot;Jump Off a Building&quot;, which featured the track &quot;Genesis 12a&quot;; Margera would later enlist the band to provide music for his later videos, including the first &quot;CKY&quot; video in 1999. CKY&#x27;s debut albums, &quot;Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Volume 2&quot;, were released in February 1999, made up mostly of the tracks featured in Bam&#x27;s videos.

In promotion of &quot;Volume 1&quot;, CKY joined the 1999 Warped Tour, although after taking part in a protest started by fans regarding vending prices they were removed from the tour. Later in the year, the band signed a record deal with Volcom Entertainment, who reissued &quot;Volume 1&quot; twice in early 2000 – firstly under the title &quot;CKY&quot;, crediting the group as Camp, and secondly under the title &quot;Camp&quot;, crediting the group as CKY. In February, the group fired Bruni as they were &quot;disappointed by his abilities and performance&quot; on the Warped Tour, and he was replaced by Vernon Zaborowski in July, after Ginsburg briefly filled in on bass. The band returned to the Warped Tour in 2000, and the limited edition EP &quot;Disengage the Simulator&quot; was released later in the year. CKY&#x27;s music began appearing on &quot;Jackass&quot; in October 2000, which is said to have generated &quot;a flood of new fans&quot;.

===2001–2004: &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild&quot; and chart success===

In May 2001, CKY ended their partnership with Volcom and signed with The Island Def Jam Music Group. After more remastered reissues of &quot;Volume 1&quot;, the band recorded its second studio album &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild&quot; between November 2001 and January 2002, and released it in September 2002. The album gave the band its first experience of chart success, when it reached number 99 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The single &quot;Flesh into Gear&quot; also charted, reaching number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart.

The group began touring the United States in promotion of the album, but in November was invited by Guns N&#x27; Roses frontman Axl Rose to perform in Vancouver as the opening warm-up act for the Chinese Democracy Tour, just three days before it was due to begin. Speaking about the news, Margera revealed that CKY had to cancel two of their own shows in California in order to travel to the Guns N&#x27; Roses concert, but admitted that he was &quot;psyched because that&#x27;s probably the biggest tour of [the] year&quot;. However, due to a delayed flight blamed on &quot;mechanical troubles&quot;, Rose failed to arrive to Vancouver in time and the show had to be cancelled, inciting riots started by audience members. It was later announced that CKY would return to perform on the remainder of the United States leg of the tour, which was scheduled to run until January 2003. It was ultimately cancelled almost a month early.

CKY toured throughout the rest of 2003 on the Out on the Noose Again Tour, which was delayed when Ginsburg broke his tailbone after falling down a flight of stairs. The band secured a high-profile support slot for Metallica in May 2003, after frontman James Hetfield personally approached Miller with the opportunity. The band&#x27;s first video album, &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild: The Video Album&quot;, was released in November 2003, featuring music videos for all ten tracks from the 2002 album as well as &quot;96 Quite Bitter Beings&quot; and &quot;Disengage the Simulator&quot;, behind-the-scenes features, and a three-hour documentary titled &quot;CKY: Chopped &amp; Sliced&quot;. Two-track EP &quot;Hellview&quot; was also released in 2003.

===2004–2006: &quot;An Answer Can Be Found&quot; and Matt Deis===
On April 7, 2004, the band returned to the studio to begin recording the follow-up to &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild&quot;. Band members periodically offered updates on the album, with Miller labelling it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;the best rock record of 2005&quot;, and Ginsburg calling it &quot;an instant classic&quot;. Zaborowski was fired from the band in June 2004, with Ginsburg once again filling in on bass for a number of live shows. &quot;Familiar Realm&quot; was released as the lead single from the new album in May 2005, reaching number 32 on the Mainstream Rock chart. &quot;An Answer Can Be Found&quot; followed in June, reaching number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album sold 27,786 copies in the United States in its first week of release.

It was announced in July 2005 that former All That Remains bassist Matt Deis had replaced Zaborowski, performing his first show with the band on July 18 at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California. The new lineup set out on tour to promote &quot;An Answer Can Be Found&quot;, joining the Rock Adio Tour arranged by skateboarding company Adio Footwear with Fireball Ministry and The Knives, which ran between August and September. Later tour dates included a headline performance at Skate Fest in Worcester, Massachusetts, a UK stint with Clutch between September and October, and a North American tour with Avenged Sevenfold in early 2006.

The band ended its partnership with Island in April 2006. Speaking at the time, Miller explained that the band had been asking to leave the label since 2003, claiming it &quot;had no idea how to market a band that doesn&#x27;t write songs about breaking up with their girlfriends&quot;.

===2006–2010: Roadrunner, &quot;Carver City&quot; and touring===

In December 2006, it was announced that CKY had signed a global recording contract with Roadrunner Records, a label which both Miller and Margera praised. Recording for the band&#x27;s fourth studio album began at Ginsburg&#x27;s Studio CIG Pennsylvania in January 2007. In March it was reported that the band had almost finished recording the album, with the song titles &quot;Hellions on Parade&quot; and &quot;The Boardwalk Body&quot; being confirmed. Speaking about the production process, Margera commented that the band was approaching it differently than it did for &quot;An Answer Can Be Found&quot;, which he described as &quot;a total guitar record&quot;. The band released another update in August, naming a number of new tracks and claiming that the album would be &quot;easily out&quot; by March or April 2008.

However, in October 2007 it was reported that there were internal tensions within the band. MTV reported that &quot;there&#x27;s trouble in the world of CKY&quot;, explaining that an altercation had broken out between Miller and Ginsburg following an incident after a gig in St. Louis, Missouri. Each of the two had different recollections of the situations – Ginsburg proposed that Miller had &quot;quit CKY to pursue his own band&quot;, and that he and Margera would continue CKY without him; Miller retorted by claiming that he had, according to MTV, &quot;overheard several of his bandmates talking smack about him in St. Louis&quot;, after which he took a brief break from the group in the hope that he would receive an apology from his bandmates. After around a year with no updates, it was reported in October 2008 that the band was almost finished with the upcoming album. Recording was completed by November.
&quot;Carver City&quot; was officially announced in January. Miller described the album as &quot;the most collaborative and focused CKY effort to date&quot;, while Ginsburg applauded it as &quot;more inventive and more layered than our past releases ... the most inspired album we have ever made&quot;. &quot;Hellions on Parade&quot; was released as the first single from the album in April, followed by &quot;A#1 Roller Rager&quot; on May 4. &quot;Carver City&quot; was released later in the month, charting at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and selling 11,000 copies in the US in its first week.

CKY began touring in promotion of &quot;Carver City&quot; in June 2009, performing dates in North America with support acts ASG and Graveyard until August, when the run ended with a &quot;hometown show&quot; in Philadelphia. Later in the year the band visited several countries in Europe, and in January 2010 played in Japan for the first time. Later tour dates in 2010 included performances at Sonisphere Festival in the UK on August 1, which Miller described as &quot;he biggest highlight of CKY&#x27;s summer touring schedule by far&quot;, and shows in Australia and New Zealand.

===2010–2014: &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot; and Miller&#x27;s departure===

In May 2010, it was announced on CKY&#x27;s official website that Deis &quot;could no longer commit&quot; to the band. He was later replaced by Matt &quot;Matty J&quot; Janaitis. In September the band released the single &quot;Afterworld&quot;, which was the first song by the band to feature vocals by Ginsburg. The song was written for the third &quot;Jackass&quot; film, &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, and was included in its closing credits upon release in October. It was later revealed that the song would also be featured on an upcoming compilation album titled &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot;, which featured a number of previously unreleased and out-of-print tracks and was released in March 2011. In promotion of the album, CKY completed a US tour in March. &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot; was later released on vinyl featuring a number of additional tracks in September 2011.

The future of the band was once again cast into doubt in July 2011, when members disagreed about its future. In a video titled &quot;CKY – What Next?&quot;, Miller noted that he and Margera had the idea for each of the band&#x27;s members to record individual albums and then release them as an overall &quot;CKY&quot; package, which Janaitis also supported. However, Ginsburg was opposed to the plan, claiming that he would prefer to record a follow-up to &quot;Carver City&quot;. Miller presented an alternate version of events in an interview in October 2015, claiming that it was Ginsburg&#x27;s idea initially to produce albums in other bands (Miller in World Under Blood, Ginsburg in Rudy &amp; Blitz and Margera in The Company Band), before a disagreement between the guitarist and his former bandmates left him without a side project. The rift escalated in the days and weeks following the release of the video, as Miller claimed on his Facebook page that Ginsburg had left the band, before himself announcing that he too would be &quot;throwing the towel in&quot; after completing the group&#x27;s upcoming shows. Margera cited Miller&#x27;s alcohol abuse as one of the causes of the tensions. The band performed a show dubbed &quot;Christmas with CKY&quot; on December 18 in Reading, Pennsylvania, which Ginsburg labelled on Twitter as the last CKY show.
CKY returned in February 2012 with Year Long Disaster vocalist and guitarist Daniel Davies in place of founding frontman Miller, performing at the Australian festival Soundwave. In an interview at the festival with The Pit FM, the band claimed that they intended to record new CKY material with Davies later that year. After a year without CKY news, in March 2013 Margera posted on the &quot;Ask CKY&quot; section of the band&#x27;s website to assure fans that the status of the group was still unclear, although he also noted that &quot;5 or 6 awesome songs&quot; had been written with Ginsburg and Janaitis which may be released as CKY. In October, Miller made a statement that he had changed his mind about relinquishing the band&#x27;s moniker, and noted that he would be recording a new CKY album for a 2014 release whether he could reconcile with the other band members or not.

===2014–2021: Frontman changes and &quot;The Phoenix&quot;===

In January 2014, Miller and Ginsburg shared a number of new photos of them together with guitars, indicating a potential reunion for the band. Miller expanded on the news on his Facebook page, revealing that he had reached out to &quot;almost all former members&quot; of the band but was unsure as to who would return, and that he and Ginsburg were working on at least eight songs together. Another update was issued in March, with Miller revealing that he and Ginsburg had &quot;collaborated on a very mellow, melancholy song idea&quot; recently, and that he wanted the new CKY album to serve as the soundtrack to a planned documentary about the band. Miller confirmed on February 12, 2015, that the reconciliation hadn&#x27;t worked out, claiming that working with Ginsburg was &quot;so irritating and so stressful [he] had no choice but to cut the chord&quot;. That same day, it was announced that CKY would be performing at Canadian festival Amnesia Rockfest in June. Miller claimed that he knew nothing about the show and Ginsburg asserted that his focus was on his upcoming solo album, although it was confirmed by Bam Margera that Jess would be involved in the show. The band played the festival with Davies returning as frontman. However, Miller also used the CKY moniker (as &quot;CKY + Foreign Objects&quot;) for a number of shows booked in 2015 with guitarist Kenneth Hunter, bassist Shaun Luera and drummer Tim Luera. In an interview with &quot;The Sinner&#x27;s Ball&quot; radio show in August 2015, Miller described his former bandmates as &quot;pathetic sons of bitches&quot; and condemned Davies&#x27; performances in the band as &quot;embarrassing&quot;. In a later interview in October, Miller claimed that he would be re-recording and re-releasing &quot;An Answer Can Be Found&quot;, as well as a new album, under the name MechaCKY (later renamed 96 Bitter Beings).

In May 2016, it was confirmed that Ginsburg, Margera and Deis would be continuing as a three-piece CKY (with the guitarist also singing), performing at the Random Hero Festival (in honour of deceased CKY Crew member Ryan Dunn) in Cleveland, Ohio, in June and recording a new album in July at Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California. The following February, the band announced its first tour as a three-piece, with 12 shows in the UK (their first in the country since 2011) scheduled for May 2017. Due to &quot;popular demand&quot;, a second date at London&#x27;s Camden Underworld was later added to the end of the tour, while several other shows were upgraded to larger venues. The group also performed at all dates on the 2017 Warped Tour, which ran between June 16 and August 6, 2017, and included 41 shows in the United States and Canada. In March 2017, CKY signed a worldwide deal with Entertainment One Music, and released their fifth studio album, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, that June. Throughout October and November 2017, CKY toured the United States as the opening act for HIM on HIM&#x27;s farewell tour. 

On November 22, 2018, the band released an EP titled &quot;Too Precious to Kill&quot;. A vinyl-only release, it features three new songs and a GG Allin cover, &quot;Bite It You Scum&quot;. The EP was released to streaming services the following year.

On June 3, 2019, the band announced that Deis had left the band. In a statement by Deis, the bassist explained that &quot;I&#x27;m stepping aside to focus on myself and my family so that CKY can continue their dominant return with nothing holding it back.&quot; Former A Life Once Lost bassist Chris Weyh performed with the band for the Vans Warped Tour 25th anniversary show. Ginsburg and Margera performed as a duo using backing tracks for a subsequent European tour. CKY released &quot;Fuck.Shit.Help. &amp; Yeah&quot; featuring late Turbonegro frontman Hank von Hell, alongside Anders Odden from Cadaver, on November 26, 2021.

===2022–present: &quot;New Reason to Dream&quot;===
Ginsburg indicated in August 2022 that work on a new CKY album had begun. The band also announced that they would be performing at the Blue Ridge Rock Festival on September 7, 2023. In May 2024, the band is set to complete its first US tour in over five years, the New Reason to Dream Tour, to mark its 25th anniversary. On April 30, 2024, Ginsburg confirmed the upcoming album title as &quot;New Reason to Dream&quot;. He also said that the album is in the mixing process, and will be released independently.

In November 2024, CKY was removed from a tour of the UK and Ireland in support of Alien Ant Farm, after frontman Dryden Mitchell accused Ginsburg of punching him in the face in the last of a string of incidents also involving members of the road crew and other bands.

==Musical style ==
=== Music ===
A number of music critics have stated that it as difficult to categorize CKY into a specific musical genre. The band is categorized by AllMusic as post-grunge, hard rock, and stoner rock. Due to the band&#x27;s association with professional skateboarding (owed mainly to its link with Bam Margera), its music has been dubbed as skate punk, but it is suggested by AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato that this label was extinguished upon the release of &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild&quot;, which features a &quot;heavy alt-metal sound&quot;. The group&#x27;s sound has been described as stoner metal by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jenny Eliscu. Writers at both Blabbermouth.net and the Ultimate Guitar Archive have described CKY as &quot;genre-defying&quot;, while PopMatters reviewer Nikki Tranter described the sound on &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild&quot; as &quot;impossible to label&quot;.

=== Lyrics ===
CKY&#x27;s lyrics cover a wide variety of themes. On &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild&quot;, it is proposed by Tranter that a number of tracks are written about &quot;the decaying state of humanity&quot; and &quot;the need for some kind of freedom&quot;, with the writer describing the lyrics as &quot;relentlessly dark, yet beautifully written, observant and real&quot;. On &quot;An Answer Can Be Found&quot;, there are multiple songs said to be renouncing the idea of suicide. The band has also written songs as part of ongoing storylines on a number of occasions – &quot;96 Quite Bitter Beings&quot;, &quot;Escape from Hellview&quot; and &quot;Hellions on Parade&quot; (as well as an early demo called &quot;Thanks for the Ride&quot;) make up a series of songs about a fictional town called Hellview, the residents of which &quot;doesn&#x27;t take kindly to outsiders&quot;, and the songs on &quot;Carver City&quot; tell a story of a town named after a fisherman, who killed his crew and later returns to &quot;curse the city&quot;.

==Controversy==
The fanbase of CKY is affectionately dubbed the CKY Alliance, and has been identified as particularly passionate about the band. Miller has proposed that the Alliance is &quot;almost more important than the band&quot;, praising them as instrumental in the band&#x27;s success. Following the release of &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild&quot;, members of the Alliance &quot;bombarded&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine with &quot;pissed-off e-mails&quot; after it awarded the album two out of five stars in a negative review. After they followed this with another poor review of &quot;An Answer Can Be Found&quot;, Miller responded to writer Jenny Eliscu, mocking her as &quot;an aging, ugly skank&quot; and mocking &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; themselves as &quot;predictable, tiresome and unprofessional&quot; to have even employed her. The band&#x27;s fans followed by waging a &quot;harassment campaign&quot; against her, which included phoning and emailing her with death threats.

== Critical reception ==
Albums by CKY have received acclaim from music critics. Common points of commendation include the band&#x27;s mix of various musical styles, the guitar performances of Miller and Ginsburg, the group&#x27;s high production values, and the experimental nature of many songs. Other commentators, however, have identified and criticized a reliance on similar styles for multiple songs – &quot;An Answer Can Be Found&quot;, for example, was criticized by a number of sources a lack of progression and invention. A similar sentiment was echoed in relation to &quot;Carver City&quot; by Blabbermouth.net writer Keith Bergman.

<text>Tunku Puan Besar Hajah Kurshiah binti Almarhum Tunku Besar Burhanuddin (Jawi: ; 16 May 1911 – 2 February 1999) was the Tunku Ampuan Besar or Queen of Negeri Sembilan. She also served as the first Raja Permaisuri Agong of Malaya between 1957 and 1960.

Tunku Kurshiah&#x27;s sister, Tunku Durah married her stepson Tuanku Munawir Ibni Al-Marhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman and succeeded her as Tunku Ampuan Besar in 1960.

==Early life==
Born on 16 May 1911 in Seri Menanti, Negeri Sembilan, she was the eldest daughter of Tunku Besar Burhanuddin ibni Almarhum Tuanku Antah (sometime Regent of Negeri Sembilan). She received her early education at the Seri Menanti Malay School. She also attended private English classes.

==Becoming Queen==

Tuanku Kurshiah married Tuanku Abdul Rahman ibni Almarhum Tuanku Muhammad, the ruler of Negeri Sembilan as his third wife on 21 May 1929. They had two daughters; Tuanku Bahiyah, who became Sultanah of Kedah and Tunku Shahariah, who became the wife of Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Tunku Bendahara of Johor.

Upon her husband&#x27;s accession to the throne of Negeri Sembilan in 1933, Tunku Kurshiah was proclaimed Tunku Ampuan Besar or Queen Consort of Negeri Sembilan.

In 1957, her husband was elected as the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong of independent Malaya (later Malaysia) and she became the first Raja Permaisuri Agong or Queen.

Tuanku Abdul Rahman died in April 1960 and Tunku Kurshiah was given the title of Tunku Puan Besar of Negeri Sembilan.

==Social contributions==
In 1954, Tuanku Kurshiah was appointed as the President of the Negeri Sembilan Girl Guides. She was also the patron of the Women’s Institute of Negeri Sembilan. In May 1961, she established the Muslim Women Welfare Council as the Founder President. On 27 October 1974, she was awarded the Tun Fatimah Gold Medal by the National Council of Women’s Organisations for her contribution in elevating the standard of women and children through welfare and education.

==Death==
Tunku Kurshiah died in her sleep at 4:50 pm due to old age and from an illness in Kuala Lumpur on 2 February 1999 and her remains were buried at the Seri Menanti Royal Mausoleum in Seri Menanti.

==Family of Queens==
Tunku Kurshiah due to her royal lineage has links to many former queens of Negeri Sembilan but also has links with many of the royal families of the other states. Her daughter Tuanku Bahiyah became Sultanah of Kedah and later the fifth Raja Permaisuri Agong. Both her younger sisters succeeded her as Tunku Ampuan Besar, first by Tunku Ampuan Durah who was married to her eldest stepson Tuanku Munawir and second by her youngest sister Tuanku Najihah, who married her youngest stepson Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman. Tuanku Najihah also followed in Tunku Kurshiah&#x27;s footsteps and served as the 10th Raja Permaisuri Agong.

<doc id="583362" wikidata="Q250683" url="?curid=583362" title="4015 Wilson–Harrington">
<text>4015 Wilson–Harrington is an active asteroid known both as comet 107P/Wilson–Harrington and as asteroid 4015 Wilson–Harrington. It passed from Earth on 20 July 2022 and then passed perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on 24 August 2022. It seldom gets brighter than apparent magnitude 16. It will return to perihelion on 25 November 2026.

== Observational history ==
This near-Earth object is considered both an Apollo asteroid with the designation &quot;4015 Wilson–Harrington&quot; and a periodic comet known as &quot;Comet Wilson–Harrington&quot; or &quot;107P/Wilson–Harrington&quot;. It was initially discovered in 1949 as a comet and then lost to further observations. Thirty years later it was rediscovered as an asteroid, after which it took over a decade to determine that these observations were of the same object. Therefore, it has both a comet designation and an asteroid designation, and with a name length of 17 characters it is currently the asteroid with the longest name, having one more character than the 16-character limit imposed by the IAU.

The comet was discovered on 19 November 1949, by Albert G. Wilson and Robert G. Harrington at Palomar Observatory. Only three photographic observations were obtained and the comet was lost (insufficient observations to determine a precise enough orbit to know where to look for future appearances of the comet.)

On 15 November 1979, an apparent Mars-crosser asteroid was found by Eleanor F. Helin, also of Palomar Observatory. It received the designation 1979 VA, and when re-observed on 20 December 1988, received the permanent number 4015.

On 13 August 1992, it was reported that asteroid (4015) 1979 VA and comet 107P/Wilson–Harrington were the same object. By then, enough observations of the asteroid had accumulated to obtain a fairly precise orbit, and the search of old photographic plates for prediscovery images turned up the 1949 plates with the images of the lost comet.

Although the 1949 images show cometary features, all subsequent images show only a stellar image, suggesting it might be an inactive comet that undergoes only infrequent outbursts.

== Orbital and physical properties ==
The eccentricity is 0.624, which is somewhat higher than that of a typical asteroid-belt minor planet and more typical of periodic comets. Its Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) of less than 0.05 AU and its large size make it a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA).

There are only eight other objects that are cross-listed as both comets and asteroids: 2060 Chiron (95P/Chiron), 7968 Elst–Pizarro (133P/Elst–Pizarro), 60558 Echeclus (174P/Echeclus), 118401 LINEAR (176P/LINEAR), (282P/2003 BM80), (288P/2006 VW139), (362P/2008 GO98), and (433P/2005 QN173). As a dual status object, astrometric observations of 4015 Wilson–Harrington should be reported under the minor planet designation.

== Exploration ==
A flyby of 4015 Wilson–Harrington was formerly planned by Deep Space 1. It was also considered for the NEAR mission.

<text>Tengku Ampuan Hajah Jema&#x27;ah binti Almarhum Raja Ahmad (Jawi: ; born Raja Jema&#x27;ah binti Raja Ahmad; 1900 – 8 April 1973) was the &quot;Tengku Ampuan&quot; (Queen consort) of Selangor and the second Raja Permaisuri Agong of Malaysia the then Federation of Malaya during the brief reign of her husband, Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah Al-Haj ibni Almarhum Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah.

== Biography ==
Born in 1900, in Bandar Termasha, Kuala Langat, Selangor, she was a member of a junior branch of the Selangor royal family. She was a descendant of first Sultan of Selangor. She received her early education in a Malay School near the Bandar Termasha Palace.

In 1920, Tengku Ampuan Jema&#x27;ah married Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah who was then the royal escort to Sultan Alaiddin Sulaiman Shah. In 1924, hence she became the special escort to Tengku Ampuan Fatimah.

In 1926, Tengku Ampuan Jema&#x27;ah gave birth to a son, Tengku Abdul Aziz Shah, who later became the 8th Sultan of Selangor.

In 1952, Tengku Ampuan Jema&#x27;ah performed the pilgrimage in Makkah and in the following year she accompanied Sultan Hishamuddin Alam Shah for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in United Kingdom.

Her husband, Sultan Alam Shah, died of a mysterious illness at the Istana Tetamu in Kuala Lumpur on 1 September 1960 - the day fixed for his installation, and a day after the third anniversary of Hari Merdeka. According to then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, the ruler had been struck down by illness after using the royal regalia in advance of his installation. His death occurred after 27 days of illness. He was buried at the Royal Mausoleum near Sultan Sulaiman Mosque in Klang, Selangor on 3 September 1960.

Following her husband&#x27;s death, Tengku Ampuan Jema&#x27;ah lived in quiet retirement until her death on 8 April 1973.

Her only child succeeded his father as Sultan of Selangor and as Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah Al-Haj. He also reigned as Malaysia&#x27;s eleventh Yang di-Pertuan Agong. But like his father, he died while in office.

==Social Contributions==
Tengku Ampuan Jema&#x27;ah had a keen interest in trying out various types of handicraft at the palace. She was good at knitting, embroidery and patch work. When she moved to Klang, she gathered women from the villages and started a handicraft training programme for them. The craftwork was sent to Raffles Hotel in Singapore under the brand name “Pertukangan Tangan Melayu Selangor” (The Selangor Malay Handicrafts) and sponsored by the wife of the Governor of Singapore back then. The Malay Handicrafts Shop was first opened in Klang. Subsequently, another branch was opened at the Robinson Shop in Kuala Lumpur with the assistance of its manager.

The &quot;Gerai Selangor&quot; (Selangor Booth) at the Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture and Agrotourism (MAHA) exhibition in Kuala Lumpur attracted many European tourists. Several awards for silverwork won by the said booth are on display at the Istana Shah Alam Museum. These awards were the result of Tengku Ampuan Jemaah&#x27;s effort.

==Awards and recognitions==
* First Class of the Royal Family Order of Selangor (DK I) (1973)

===Places named after her===
Several places were named after her, including: 
* Tengku Ampuan Jemaah Hospital in Sabak Bernam, Selangor

<doc id="583367" wikidata="Q834654" url="?curid=583367" title="7968 Elst–Pizarro">
<text>Comet Elst–Pizarro is a body that displays characteristics of both asteroids and comets, and is the prototype of active asteroids. Its orbit keeps it within the asteroid belt, yet it displayed a dust tail like a comet while near perihelion in 1996, 2001, and 2007.
* As a comet it is formally designated 133P/Elst–Pizarro.
* As an asteroid it is designated 7968 Elst–Pizarro.

Elst–Pizarro was reported in 1979 as minor planet , with its image on a photographic plate being completely stellar in appearance. Its orbit remains entirely within the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, with eccentricity 0.165, typical of a minor planet in the asteroid belt. However, the images taken by Eric W. Elst and Guido Pizarro in 1996, when it was near perihelion, clearly show a cometary tail. Since this is not normal behaviour for asteroids, it is suspected that Elst–Pizarro has a different, probably icy, composition. The cometary nature of Elst–Pizarro was first discovered when a linear dust feature was observed with the ESO 1-metre Schmidt telescope at La Silla Observatory on 7 August 1996.

Subsequently, around the next perihelion in November 2001, the cometary activity appeared again, and persisted for 5 months. It again came to perihelion on 8 February 2013. The outgassing was found to happen only on small part of the surface measuring less than in effective diameter, likely being the relatively recent (younger than 100 million years) impact crater.

At present, seven other objects that are cross-listed as both comets and asteroids: 2060 Chiron (95P/Chiron), 4015 Wilson–Harrington (107P/Wilson–Harrington), 60558 Echeclus (174P/Echeclus), 118401 LINEAR (176P/LINEAR), (282P/2003 BM80), (288P/2006 VW139), (362P/2008 GO98), and (433P/2005 QN173). As a dual status object, astrometric observations of 7968 Elst–Pizarro should be reported under the minor planet designation.

==Exploration==

&quot;Castalia&quot; is a proposed mission concept for a robotic spacecraft to explore Pizarro and make the first &quot;in situ&quot; measurements of water in the asteroid belt, and thus, help solve the mystery of the origin of Earth&#x27;s water. The lead is Colin Snodgrass, from The Open University in the UK. &quot;Castalia&quot; was proposed in 2015 and 2016 to the European Space Agency within the Cosmic Vision programme missions M4 and M5, but it was not selected. The team continues to mature the mission concept and science objectives. Because of the construction time required and orbital dynamics, a launch date of October 2028 was proposed.

&quot;Castalia&quot; mission scientists are now considering instrument contributions for the Chinese ZhengHe comet exploration mission, which will conduct detailed remote sensing and in-situ measurements at Elst–Pizarro in 2032 following a proposed launch in 2025.

<doc id="583368" wikidata="Q4251695" url="?curid=583368" title="Raja Perempuan Budriah">
<text>&quot;Raja Perempuan Besar&quot; Tengku Budriah binti Almarhum Tengku Ismail (Jawi: ; 28 March 1924 – 28 November 2008) was the Raja Perempuan of Perlis and the third Raja Permaisuri Agong of Malaysia as the wife of Tuanku Syed Putra Jamalullail.

==Early life==
She was born in Kuala Krai, Kelantan on 28 March 1924. She was the daughter of Almarhum Tengku Mek Haji Ismail Ibni HH Tuan Besar, the Raja of Pattani in Southern Thailand, and wife Tengku Besar Zubaidah binti Almarhum Tengku Abdul Kadir. Her late father, Tengku Mek Haji Ismail was son of HH Raja Tuan Besar Ibni Tuan Long Puteh, the third king of Pattani from Long Yunus dynasty of Kelantan while his mother was a daughter of the last king of Pattani, HH Sultan Abdul Kadir Kamaruddin Syah Ibni Sultan Sulaiman Syarafuddin Syah, brother of Tengku Muhammad Shah Of Pattani, Tengku Baniun of Pattani.

Her family ruled Pattani in south Thailand until it was overthrown by King Chulalongkorn in his effort to consolidate his hold on the southern part of that country. Tengku Budriah&#x27;s grandfather, the former Sultan Abdul Kadir Kamaruddin Ibni Sultan Sulaiman Sharafuddin (Tuan Long Bongsu) of Patani, withdrew to Kelantan. The ruling family of Kelantan was distantly related to that of Patani. Long Muhammad Ibni Raja Muda Long Ismail, the grandson of Long Yunus (King of united Kelantan) was appointed by Siam to rule Pattani after he reconciled and give up his right on Kelantanese throne to his cousin, Long Senik Mulut Merah (Sultan Muhammad II of Kelantan).

Tengku Budriah was brought up in a family which had a simple way of life. She was noted for her gentleness and politeness. By her active involvement in uniformed organisations she developed herself into a personality with superior leadership traits.

She began her primary education in Kuala Krai Malay School when she was seven, then continued her education at Kuala Krai English School. Tengku Budriah later spent her Lower Secondary Education at the Anglo-Chinese Girls School in Ipoh, Perak. As an active person in extra-curricular activities, she was appointed as committee member in Brownies and Girl Guides, and would later attend the 1950 Girl Guides Jamboree in Australia.

Besides that she was also active in sports where she represented her school team in badminton and hockey, and also enjoyed sewing, cooking, flower arrangement and horse riding.

==Marriage and becoming Queen==
At the age of 16, Tengku Budriah married Tuanku Syed Putra ibni Almarhum Syed Hassan Jamalullail, heir apparent of Perlis in 1941. She went on to bear him five princes and five princesses.

When he was exiled by the Japanese occupying forces during the second World War, she helped him run a small cake and sundry goods shop in Kota Bharu. After the 1945 Japanese surrender she returned to Perlis with her family, travelling by train to Padang Besar, then by manually operated railway trolley (&quot;Gek-gek&quot;) to Bukit Keteri since there was no train link.

Her husband became Raja of Perlis in 1945 and Tengku Budriah was installed Raja Perempuan or Queen of that state. Then in 1960 Tuanku Syed Putra was elected the third King of Malaysia (Yang di-Pertuan Agong) and Tengku Budriah accordingly became Queen (Raja Permaisuri Agong).

When her husband died in 2000, he was the world&#x27;s longest reigning monarch. Her eldest son Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin also served as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia from 2001 till 12 December 2006. Her title after the death of the king was YMM (Yang Maha Mulia) Raja Perempuan Besar Perlis, which means HRH the Queen dowager of Perlis.

==Hobbies==
Tengku Budriah spent most of her leisure time enjoying her favourite hobbies such as gardening, sewing, flower arrangement and cooking. She often cooked for her husband especially when they were on vacation abroad.

In later life she took up a new interest in painting flowers on dresses, scarves and porcelain for sale where profits made from the sales were donated to the welfare funds of Taman Asuhan Darulfarah. She also liked to spend time in her durian orchard.

==Charity work==
Tengku Budriah took several initiatives to upgrade the welfare of the people of Perlis. She often visited schools and awarded school uniforms to poor students.

The royal family were pioneers in implementing the Foster Parents Project organised by the Women Institution (W.I.) of Perlis. Each royal family member would take one poor foster child to support for his education. This project succeeded in helping the poor students to continue their education to higher levels.

Tengku Budriah also played an active role in the progress and welfare of the women in the country. She acted as patron and chairman to several movements in the state and nationwide such as Perlis Women Institutions (W.I.), Perlis Muslim Women Welfare Association, Perlis Family Planning Association, Malaysian Women&#x27;s Hockey Association, Perlis Children Welfare Board and Taman Asuhan Darulfarah.

In 2002 the nursery managed by Darulfarah was closed down and thus the name Taman Asuhan Darulfarah was changed to &quot;Yayasan Amal Tengku Hajah Budriah&quot; and the latest project was initiated through her ideas and commitment was the setting up of Tuanku Syed Putra Dialysis Centre built next to the existing Darulfarah building which was completed in June 2005 and the Syed Putra Foundation for Kidney Disease.

Tengku Budriah lived in quiet retirement in Perlis, though active in charitable organisations.

==Death==
She died in her sleep at the age of 84 in Hospital Kuala Lumpur at 3:47am due to old age on 28 November 2008.

The King, Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin and the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi paid their last respects in Kuala Lumpur before her body was flown on a Royal Malaysian Air Force Hercules aircraft from Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport to the Sultan Abdul Halim Airport in Alor Star. Her body was then taken on a hearse (driven overland from the Sultan Abdul Halim-Kepala Batas Airport in Alor Star) to the royal town of Arau, where the local citizens were given an hour to pay their last respects; among them were the Sultan and Sultanah of Kedah. She was buried at the Perlis Royal Mausoleum in the afternoon.

==Awards and recognitions==
She has been awarded:

===Honours of Perlis===

<doc id="583389" wikidata="Q4207393" url="?curid=583389" title="Tunku Puan Zanariah">
<text>Tunku Puan Zanariah Iskandar (Jawi: تونكو ڤوان زانريه إسكندر), formerly known as Sultanah Zanariah (born Tengku Zanariah binti Tengku Ahmad; 5 July 1940 – 17 March 2019), was the second wife of the fourth Sultan of modern Johor, Sultan Iskandar from their marriage in 1961 until his death in 2010. She served as Raja Permaisuri Agong (Queen consort of Malaysia) between 1984 and 1989.

Her sister, Tunku Puan Nora formerly Sultanah Nora was married to the third Sultan of modern Johor, Sultan Ismail.

==Early life==
Born on 5 July 1940, in Dusun Green Palace, Pasir Mas, Kelantan. Tengku Zanariah was the seventh child of HH Tengku Panglima Raja of Kelantan from among nine siblings. She came from the Kelantan royal family. Her father, the late &quot;Tengku Panglima Raja&quot; Tengku Ahmad was a son of Almarhum &quot;Tengku Temenggong&quot; Tengku Abdul Ghaffar Ibni Almarhum Long Senik Mulut Merah (Sultan Muhammad II).

Tengku Zanariah was enrolled into Sultanah Zainab School, Kelantan an elementary school where she studied from 1946 to 1949. From 1950 till 1952 she studied at the Convent Bukit Nanas in Kuala Lumpur before returning to Kelantan where she continued her studies at Sultan Ibrahim School, Pasir Mas. With the encouragement of her father and her own desire to equip herself for the future, she left for England in 1954 to further her studies at the Upper Chime School, Isle of Wight.

While studying in England, Tengku Zanariah met Tunku Mahmood Iskandar (later Sultan Iskandar) who was also studying there. They later married in 1961 (his second marriage) and she later became the mother of six of Tunku Mahmood&#x27;s children.

Tengku Zanariah is also the former beauty queen and historically was the first ever Miss International Malaysia titleholders. She went to compete internationally representing Federation of Malaya at the first Miss International beauty pageant in 1960 at the Long Beach, California, United States. She failed to place in the semi-finals.

==Sultanah of Johor==
Her husband became Sultan of Johor in 1981. Although she was known as Sultanah, she was never formally crowned.

In 1982, Tengku Zanariah sponsored and established the Majlis Wanita Negeri Johor or MAWAR (the Women&#x27;s Council of Johor), which organises various religious activities such as the celebration of Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s birthday at its headquarters at Sungai Cat Road in Johor Bahru. MAWAR also collected donations for distribution among flood victims in Johor as well as the less fortunate and the needy.

Her husband died in 2010 and was succeeded by her stepson Tunku Ibrahim Ismail. In 2011, a government circular issued removed the honorific prefix of &#x27;Sultanah&#x27; from her given name, and instructed that she be referred to instead as &#x27;Tunku Puan Zanariah Iskandar&#x27; or simply &#x27;Tunku Zanariah&#x27;. The current royal court also does not recognise her as a former holder of the title &quot;Sultanah of Johor&quot;.

==Interests==
Tengku Zanariah had a passion for the arts. She also loved cooking and took great care in her daily chores. She paid special attention to the selection and arrangement of decorations in the palace particularly in preparation for official dinners. Tengku Zanariah also loved reading especially about culture, history and affairs of neighbouring countries.

She was also the winner of the first edition of Miss Malaya-International 1960 where she had rights to represent Malaya in the first edition of Miss International 1960 pageant in California, United States. Unfortunately, she was not placed in the pageant during that time.

During her free time, Tengku Zanariah loved to exercise, ride horses and play golf or tennis. She was also good in water skiing. During her younger days, she climbed Gunung Ledang, the highest mountain in Johor. She is currently the only consort to have done so.

==Patronages==
* Chancellor of the University of Technology, Malaysia (UTM) from 1986 to 2010.
* Patron of the Iskandar Puteri Foundation.

<text>The year 1924 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy and space exploration==

* November 23 – Edwin Hubble announces his discovery that Andromeda, previously believed to be a nebula, is actually another galaxy, and that the Milky Way is only one of many such galaxies in the universe.
* The Einstein Tower near Potsdam, Germany, designed by Erich Mendelsohn, becomes operational as an astrophysical observatory.
* Mount Stromlo Observatory near Canberra, Australia, is established as the Commonwealth Solar Observatory.
* 1056 Azalea is discovered.

==Biology==
*The term &quot;ectogenesis&quot; is coined by British scientist J. B. S. Haldane to describe the growth of mammalian embryos in artificial environments.
*California grizzly bear last sighted.

==Biochemistry==
* The first inactive tetanus vaccine (tetanus toxoid, TT) is discovered by Gaston Ramon, C. Zoeller and P. Descombey and produced.
* The first scarlet fever vaccine is discovered by George F. Dick and Gladys Dick.

==History of science and technology==
* December 17 – Dismantling of James Watt&#x27;s workshop for display in the Science Museum, London, commences.

==Mathematics==
* Polish mathematicians Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski publish the Banach–Tarski paradox.
* German mathematicians David Hilbert proposes Hilbert&#x27;s paradox of the Grand Hotel.
* Polish logician Jan Łukasiewicz devises reverse Polish notation.

==Medicine==

<doc id="583392" wikidata="Q259854" url="?curid=583392" title="Coma (comet)">
<text>The coma is the nebulous envelope around the nucleus of a comet, formed when the comet passes near the Sun in its highly elliptical orbit. As the comet warms, parts of it sublimate; this gives a comet a diffuse appearance when viewed through telescopes and distinguishes it from stars. The word &quot;coma&quot; comes from the Greek (), which means &quot;hair&quot; and is the origin of the word &quot;comet&quot; itself.

The coma is generally made of ice and comet dust. Water composes up to 90% of the volatiles that outflow from the nucleus when the comet is within from the Sun. The H2O parent molecule is destroyed primarily through photodissociation and to a much smaller extent photoionization. The solar wind plays a minor role in the destruction of water compared to photochemistry. Larger dust particles are left along the comet&#x27;s orbital path while smaller particles are pushed away from the Sun into the comet&#x27;s tail by light pressure.
On 11 August 2014, astronomers released studies, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) for the first time, that detailed the distribution of HCN, HNC, H2CO, and dust inside the comae of comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON). On 2 June 2015, NASA reported that the ALICE spectrograph on the &quot;Rosetta&quot; space probe studying comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko determined that electrons (within above the comet nucleus) produced from photoionization of water molecules by solar radiation, and not photons from the Sun as thought earlier, are responsible for the liberation of water and carbon dioxide molecules released from the comet nucleus into its coma.

==Size==

Comas typically grow in size as comets approach the Sun, and they can be as large as the diameter of Jupiter, even though the density is very low. About a month after an outburst in October 2007, comet 17P/Holmes briefly had a tenuous dust atmosphere larger than the Sun. The Great Comet of 1811 also had a coma roughly the diameter of the Sun. Even though the coma can become quite large, its size can actually decrease about the time it crosses the orbit of Mars around 1.5 AU from the Sun. At this distance the solar wind becomes strong enough to blow the gas and dust away from the coma, enlarging the tail.

==X-rays==

Comets were found to emit X-rays in late-March 1996. This surprised researchers, because X-ray emission is usually associated with very high-temperature bodies. The X-rays are thought to be generated by the interaction between comets and the solar wind: when highly charged ions fly through a cometary atmosphere, they collide with cometary atoms and molecules, &quot;ripping off&quot; one or more electrons from the comet. This ripping off leads to the emission of X-rays and far ultraviolet photons.

==Observation==
With a basic Earth-surface based telescope and some technique, the size of the coma can be calculated. Called the drift method, one locks the telescope in position and measures the time for the visible disc to pass through the field of view. That time multiplied by the cosine of the comet&#x27;s declination, times .25, should equal the coma&#x27;s diameter in arcminutes. If the distance to the comet is known, then the apparent size of the coma can be determined.

In 2015, it was noted that the ALICE instrument on the ESA Rosetta spacecraft to comet 67/P, detected hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in the coma, which they also called the comet&#x27;s atmosphere. Alice is an ultraviolet spectrograph, and it found that electrons created by UV light were colliding and breaking up molecules of water and carbon monoxide.

==Hydrogen gas halo==

OAO-2 (&#x27;Stargazer&#x27;) discovered large halos of hydrogen gas around comets. Space probe Giotto detected hydrogen ions at distance of 7.8 million km away from Halley when it did a close flyby of the comet in 1986. A hydrogen gas halo was detected to be 15 times the diameter of Sun (12.5 million miles). This triggered NASA to point the Pioneer Venus mission at the Comet, and it was determined that the Comet was emitting 12 tons of water per second. The hydrogen gas emission has not been detected from Earth&#x27;s surface because those wavelengths are blocked by the atmosphere. The process by which water is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen was studied by the ALICE instrument aboard the Rosetta spacecraft. One of the issues is where the hydrogen is coming from and how (e.g. Water splitting):

A hydrogen gas halo three times the size of the Sun was detected by Skylab around Comet Kohoutek in the 1970s. SOHO detected a hydrogen gas halo bigger than 1 AU in radius around Comet Hale–Bopp. Water emitted by the comet is broken up by sunlight, and the hydrogen in turn emits ultra-violet light. The halos have been measured to be ten billion meters across, many times bigger than the Sun. The hydrogen atom are very light so they can travel a long distance before they are themselves ionized by the Sun. When the hydrogen atoms are ionized they are especially swept away by the solar wind.

==Composition==

The Rosetta mission found carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane and methanol in the Coma of Comet 67P, as well as small amounts of formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, sulfur dioxide and carbon disulfide.

The four top gases in 67P&#x27;s halo were water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and oxygen. The ratio of oxygen to water coming off the comet remained constant for several months.

<doc id="583395" wikidata="Q4207511" url="?curid=583395" title="Raja Permaisuri Tuanku Bainun">
<text>Raja Permaisuri Tuanku Bainun (Jawi: راج ڤرمايسوري توانکو بعينون; born Bainun binti Mohd Ali; 7 November 1932) is the former Raja Permaisuri (Queen consort) of Perak. She was also the ninth Raja Permaisuri Agong (Queen Consort of Malaysia) and the first commoner ever to be installed as the Raja Permaisuri Agong. She is the widow of the Sultan Azlan Shah and the mother of the incumbent Sultan Nazrin Shah. She is now styled as Yang Maha Mulia Raja Permaisuri Tuanku Bainun.

== Background ==
Tuanku Bainun was born on 7 November 1932 in Penang in the Straits Settlements and received her early education at the St. George&#x27;s Girls School, Penang. She was selected to further her studies at the prestigious Teacher&#x27;s Training College, Kirkby, England from 1952 to 1954.

A year after returning from England, she married Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Yussuff Izzuddin Shah Ghafarullahu-lah of Perak on 9 December 1955. The Sultan was then a Magistrate in Kuala Lumpur, while Tuanku Bainun was teaching at her former school. She was a teacher for 22 years and has taught in various schools in Kuala Lumpur, Seremban, Raub, Taiping and Kuantan.

== Queen consort ==
Upon her husband&#x27;s accession to the Perakian throne on 3 February 1984, she became the Raja Permaisuri of Perak with the honorific prefix of Tuanku before her given name. In Perak a queen consort of royal blood is known as a Raja Perempuan, while the title of Raja Permaisuri was reserved for commoner consorts. Her Royal Highness was officially proclaimed the Raja Permaisuri of Perak Darul Ridzuan on 9 December 1985 in a ceremony at the Istana Iskandariah in Kuala Kangsar.

Sultan Azlan Shah was elected as the ninth Yang di-Pertuan Agong and during the oath taking and signing ceremony on 26 April 1989, Tuanku Bainun was proclaimed Raja Permaisuri Agong. Tuanku Bainun is the first commoner ever to become Queen of Malaysia. She was crowned Raja Permaisuri Agong on 19 February 1988 a new throne made of silver that replaced the ancient wooden throne used by Malaysia&#x27;s eight previous queens. They held these titles until the end of Azlan Shah&#x27;s term on 25 April 1994.

She ceased to be Raja Permaisuri of Perak on 28 May 2014, after her husband died. She was succeeded a month later by her daughter in-law, Tuanku Zara Salim.

== Royal family ==
The royal couple had five children, two sons and three daughters. The eldest is Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah, the current Sultan of Perak. The others are Raja Dato’ Seri Azureen Binti Almarhum Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah, Raja Dato’ Seri Ashman Shah Ibni Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah, Raja Dato&#x27; Seri Eleena Binti Almarhum Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah and Raja Dato&#x27; Seri Yong Sofia Binti Almarhum Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah.

<doc id="583396" wikidata="Q776728" url="?curid=583396" title="1918–19 NHL season">
<text>The 1918–19 NHL season was the second season of the National Hockey League (NHL). While at first it was uncertain that the NHL would operate, and the possibility that National Hockey Association (NHA) would be resumed, the unfinished business of Eddie Livingstone&#x27;s Toronto and Ottawa&#x27;s NHA franchise, led to the NHL owners suspending the NHA again. Livingstone would attempt to overthrow the NHA management, and failing that, attempt to operate a rival league. The pre-season was filled with legal actions, deceptions and public verbal attacks. Ultimately, the NHL operated with three teams, in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. However, the season ended early with Toronto suspending operations, leaving Montreal and Ottawa to play off for the championship. Montreal would win the playoff and travel to Seattle for the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the championship series was not completed due to influenza infecting the whole Montreal team and causing the eventual death of Montreal&#x27;s Joe Hall.

==League business==
The pre-season saw plenty of action off the ice. Toronto NHA owner Eddie Livingstone had found a partner in Percy Quinn, manager of the Toronto Arena Gardens, to take on the NHA/NHL owners. The two together tried to lease the ice time at the Toronto Arena Gardens, Ottawa Arena and Montreal Jubilee Rink from under the noses of the NHL owners, launched several lawsuits, attempted to launch a competing league and attempted to relaunch the NHA, but ultimately were unsuccessful. The NHA, while not operating, met three times.

===Purchase of Quebec Bulldogs===
The first action of Livingstone and Quinn was Quinn&#x27;s attempt to purchase the Quebec Bulldogs, putting down a $600 down payment. At the time, Quinn&#x27;s purchase was welcomed by the other NHA owners, thinking that they would gain an operating franchise. Quinn&#x27;s action gave Quinn and Livingstone three votes at NHA meetings. Livingstone still had the voting shares of the Ontarios and Torontos NHA franchises.

===Second suspension of NHA===
On September 27, 1918, in Montreal, the NHA directors met again. Ottawa, Montreal Wanderers and Canadiens voted to again suspend operations of the league. This meant that the NHL would operate for a second season. Percy Quinn&#x27;s purchase of the Quebec Bulldogs was approved but his franchise could not play. The action of the NHA directors led to Livingstone filing a lawsuit on October 1, 1918, charging that there was a conspiracy among the NHA owners, paid for by the Arena Company to suspend the NHA operations and asking the court to nullify the suspension.

On October 2, Quinn would meet with Ted Dey, owner of the Ottawa Arena and enter into an agreement to lease the Ottawa Arena. Dey accepted a check from Quinn, but did not cash it. He had plans of his own, involving the takeover of the Ottawa Senators, making it look to the Senators&#x27; management that they had no arena to play in. Rather than let the team fold, Martin Rosenthal entered into an agreement to sell the Senators to Dey.

===Lawsuit against Arena Company===
Since Toronto had won the Cup in 1917–18, a monkey wrench had been thrown into the other owners&#x27; scheme to get rid of Livingstone. His team was estimated now to be worth $20,000, and Livingstone demanded that. The Arena Company offered $7,000, but Livingstone instead sued the Arena and Charlie Querrie for $20,000. In the days following the filing of the lawsuit against Arena, Hubert Vearncombe, treasurer of the Toronto Arena Company, formed the separate Toronto Arena HC. This separated the hockey club from the Livingstone lawsuits, though the franchise still used Livingstone&#x27;s players without permission.

===Attempt to launch CHA===
A new threat to the NHL appeared. Livingstone, along with Quinn attempted to launch a competing Canadian Hockey Association (CHA). Quinn now planned to relocate the Quebec club to Toronto as the &quot;Shamrocks&quot;. When news of the purchase reached Frank Calder president of both the NHA and NHL, he demanded that Quinn declare his intentions to be a member of the NHL or CHA. Calder publicly issued a November 11 deadline for Quinn to declare his intentions. Quinn did not meet it and Calder declared the Quebec franchise suspended for the season. On October 2, Quinn signed a lease agreement with Ted Dey of the Ottawa Arena to hold exclusive rights for pro hockey there. However, Dey double-crossed Quinn, not cashing his deposit cheque, and signing a five-year agreement with the NHL for the use of the facility. At the NHL meeting on November 9, 1918, the Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal teams signed an agreement to bind themselves to the NHL for a period of five years. This was at the instigation of the Ottawa club, which would not return to the NHL otherwise, and had the pending option with Percy Quinn to operate in the Canadian league.

The directors of the Arena Company of Montreal, owner of the Montreal and Toronto arenas, met and decided to shut out the CHA, against the wishes of Quinn, effectively ending the attempt to start up the CHA for the 1918–19 season. Despite the suspension, and the public threat, Quinn agreed to meet with Calder but reached no agreement. Calder publicly offered an olive branch to Quinn to join the NHL.

===Dismissal of lawsuit against 228th===
While this was going on, the NHA&#x27;s suit to recover $3,500 from the Toronto 228th hockey team&#x27;s insurer, the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Limited, was heard and dismissed. The NHA had sued the 228th for dropping out of the NHA in 1917. In his judgment, Judge Falconbridge noted that an insurance bond posted by the 228th could never have been enforceable, and that they had been ordered overseas under no fault of their own and that there was no clear legal status of the team, having played under the franchise of the non-operating Ontario Hockey Club.

===Loss of lawsuit against Ottawa===
A judgment went against Livingstone on November 20, 1918. Livingstone had claimed that Ottawa had interfered in the proper running of the NHA when the NHA had suspended the Toronto club in February 1917. The judge ruled that the NHA operated within its constitution, as no rules on how to operate less than six teams had been written.

===Attempt to lease Montreal Jubilee Rink===
In a related development, Livingstone entered into an agreement with the managers of the Jubilee Rink to lease it for pro hockey. The manager and lessee of the Jubilee Rink, Albert Allard signed the lease against the wishes of the owner of the Jubilee Rink, the Jubilee Rink Company. When the rink owners came to fire Allard and end his lease, the rink was closed by security, locking out the owners. Legal action came to a head on December 16 when Lucien Riopel won a court judgment expelling Allard.

===Attempt to relaunch NHA===
In December 1918, Livingstone and Quinn organized a league meeting of the old NHA, attempting to force the NHA to restart, based on Quinn and Livingstone&#x27;s three votes and an attempt to disallow the vote of the Canadiens. Despite Calder labelling the meeting as &quot;illegal&quot;, Ottawa, the Canadiens and Wanderers attended. However, the attempt proved futile as heated arguments broke out between Livingstone&#x27;s side and the other owners. After the meeting, Livingstone and Quinn claimed that they now controlled the NHA. They claimed that the players were now the property of the NHA, stating that all players who had played in the previous season, &quot;east of Port Arthur&quot; had to report to the NHA. Calder now ordered all teams to pay the $200 legal fees owing. Separately, the Montreal and Ottawa NHA owners met and paid the fees owing to the league and Calder fined the Torontos, Ontarios and Quebec a further $200. Calder now publicly promised to file a court order to &quot;wind up&quot; the NHA organization. When the NHL decided to continue with play, Livingstone and Quinn threatened injunctions to stop the NHL from operating. However, the threats were not followed through on and the NHL season began on schedule.

===Major rule changes===

The penalty system was refined at the instigation of the Ottawa players:

*For minor fouls (holding a stick or lying on the ice to block a shot), a player would sit off for three minutes, allowing a substitute.
* For major fouls (including throwing a stick to prevent a score, tripping, holding, cross-checking, boarding) players would sit off for five minutes, with no substitute for three minutes. An automatic goal would be awarded in the event of the stick being thrown to prevent a score.
* For match fouls (defined as deliberately injuring or disabling a player), no substitutes were allowed for a minimum of five minutes. The player could not return for at least ten minutes, depending on the referee&#x27;s ruling. The player would receive a fine of not less than $15. A second match foul in a season would lead to an automatic suspension and discipline by the league president.

Technical changes were also made to the league rules.

*Two lines were added to the ice, painted twenty feet from center, creating three playing zones. Forward passing and kicking the puck were permitted in the middle neutral zone.
*The NHL adopted the &quot;Art Ross&quot; puck instead of the &quot;Spalding&quot; puck.

===Spanish Flu pandemic===
The first hockey death from the influenza pandemic was Ottawa&#x27;s Hamby Shore in October, 1918.

==Regular season==
It had been anticipated that the end of World War I would release many veterans to join their old clubs, but very few were demobilized in time to do so. The regular season proceeded with three teams and a twenty-game split-season schedule. However, the second half of the season was cut short to eight games when the Arenas, playing poorly and with issues about breaking training, announced after seven games of the second half, it could not continue. Calder persuaded Vearncombe to play the 18th game and then the NHL season ended at 18 games. The Arena HC withdrew from the league on February 20, 1919, following financial difficulties.

Left with only two teams, the league had its first ever best-of-seven series to determine who would meet the Pacific Coast Hockey Association champions for the Stanley Cup.

===Final standings===
==Playoffs==

===NHL Championship===
With the NHL reduced to two teams eighteen games into its 20-game season, a decision was made to have the two remaining teams—coincidentally the two teams leading each half of the season—compete in a best-of-seven series to see which team would head west to battle against the Pacific Coast Hockey Association champions. This was the second meeting between these two teams. Their only previous meeting came in the 1916–17 NHA season in a two-game total goals series which Montreal won 7–6. With Ottawa star Frank Nighbor missing most of the series due to a family bereavement, the Senators lost the first three games. With Nighbor back, the Senators won the fourth game in Ottawa 6–3, while Ottawa fans pelted Montreal&#x27;s Bert Corbeau with lemons and vegetables because he had attacked the Senator&#x27;s Jack Darragh. Montreal won the fifth game in Montreal to take the series four games to one and the right to face Seattle Metropolitans for the Stanley Cup.
&quot;Montreal wins best-of-seven series four games to one.&quot;

===Stanley Cup Finals===
This was the second playoff meeting between the Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans. Their only previous meeting came in the 1917 Stanley Cup Finals, which Seattle won in 4 games. With the series tied after five games (with one tie), the sixth game was slated for April 1, 1919, when the Spanish Flu epidemic forced the cancellation of the series. Several players on both sides were sick because of it, and it would eventually claim the life of Canadiens&#x27; forward Joe Hall five days later. Canadiens manager George Kennedy would not recover completely. This was the only time in history when the Stanley Cup was not awarded after the playoffs began.
&quot;Series ended 2–2–1 and no winner awarded – playoffs were curtailed due to the influenza epidemic.&quot;

==Awards==
* NHL champion – Montreal Canadiens

Note:

The O&#x27;Brien Cup, still considered the championship of the NHA was not actually awarded in 1919. It remained under the care of the Canadiens who had won it in 1917, until the death of their owner, George Kennedy in 1921, when the NHL made arrangements to re-use the trophy. The Hockey Hall of Fame lists Montreal as the winner for 1918–19.

<text>The TI-85 is a graphing calculator made by Texas Instruments based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. Designed in 1992 as TI&#x27;s second graphing calculator (the first was the TI-81), it was replaced by the TI-86, which has also been discontinued.

The TI-85 was significantly more powerful than the TI-81, as it was designed as a calculator primarily for use in engineering and calculus courses. Texas Instruments had included a version of BASIC on the device to allow programming. Each calculator came with a cable to connect calculators (simply a three-conductor cable with 2.5 mm phone connectors on each end). Another cable known as the TI-Graph Link was also sold, along with appropriate software, to connect the calculator to a personal computer. These cables made it possible to save programs and make backups.

The TI-85 calculator is known in the modern era for being used by Sal Khan from Khan Academy in his educational videos.

== Assembly programs ==

Enthusiasts analyzed memory backups and discovered that entries in the calculator&#x27;s CUSTOM menu pointed at specific memory locations. With this knowledge, a hack was devised where a special string could be inserted into the backup at the proper location to allow the calculator to execute assembly language programs. These programs could run much faster than their BASIC counterparts and be much more efficient in terms of memory usage. This development made the TI-85 the first TI graphing calculator that could execute assembly programs.

Programs written in assembly would be stored as string expressions and accessed through the CUSTOM menu. Games such as &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; are available, as are programs with more practical uses, such as versions of the periodic table. Total memory capacity was about 32 kilobytes, with 28226 bytes available for use.

The assembly language shell ZShell is also available for the TI-85. Probably in response to the widespread use of assembly programs, TI officially introduced assembly access in later models, such as the TI-83 and TI-86, along with expanded memory. The TI-86 is very similar to the TI-85, sharing the same display resolution (128×64), processor, and processor speed (6 MHz).

<doc id="583404" wikidata="Q146124" url="?curid=583404" title="Excitebike">
<text>is a 1984 racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was ported to arcades for the Nintendo VS. System later that year and Famicom Disk System in 1988. In North America, it became one of the best-selling games on the console. It is the first game in the &quot;Excite&quot; series.

Designed and directed by Shigeru Miyamoto, the smooth side-scrolling game engine his team developed for &quot;Excitebike&quot; was later used to develop &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985), which had the effect of Mario smoothly accelerating from a walk to a run, rather than move at a constant speed.

&quot;Excitebike&quot; was a critical and commercial success. It spawned several sequels and has been re-released multiple times onto other Nintendo platforms, such the Wii and Wii U Virtual Consoles, and Nintendo Switch Online.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Excitebike&quot; is a side-scrolling racing game in which the player takes control of a motocross racer. The two gameplay modes are Selection A as a solo race run, and Selection B against computer-controlled opponents. The objective of the game is to finish in third place or higher in a preliminary race to qualify for the Excitebike championship race. The A button accelerates the bike, and the B button activates a turbo boost that enhances the bike&#x27;s speed, but overheats the engine if it is used for too long, forcing an immobile cooldown period. The engine&#x27;s temperature can be reset by driving over arrows located along the course. The player can use the directional pad to shift between lanes, and to shift the racer&#x27;s balance midair after a jump. Landing squarely on both wheels allows the racer to maintain momentum, but an uneven landing will result in a loss of speed or a crash. Design Mode allows players to create tracks using 19 types of hurdles, with options to save and load created tracks for the Famicom Data Recorder tape drive, which was unreleased outside Japan.

==Other releases==
===&quot;VS. Excitebike&quot;===
There are two enhanced versions, both titled &quot;Vs. Excitebike&quot;.

The first version was released on VS. UniSystem for arcades in 1984, after the Famicom release. It is similar to its Famicom Disk System counterpart, though this version lacks the Design option, has three difficulty levels, and has other minor differences.

The second was released for the Famicom Disk System peripheral in 1988. The graphics and core gameplay are still the same, and the FDS version has several distinctive features that the NES and arcade versions lack:
* &quot;VS. Excite&quot; mode puts two players competing against each other. The options include the maximum number of rounds to play, the track, and the number of laps.
* The music is completely different; none of the songs from the original game are present, and it has a gameplay theme. The music is composed by Soyo Oka.
* The &quot;Original Excite&quot; mode is based on the main mode of the arcade version, with minor differences such as a different color palette.
* Its writable disk format can save created tracks.

===&quot;Excitebike: Bun Bun Mario Battle Stadium&quot;===
 also known as &quot;Mario Excite Bike&quot; or &quot;BS Excitebike&quot;, is a remake of &quot;Excitebike&quot; released for the Japan-only Satellaview peripheral for Super Famicom. The human racers have been replaced by Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, Toad, and some of Bowser&#x27;s Koopa Troopas. The concept was unchanged except for a &quot;SUPER&quot; mode where the player has unlimited turbo and coins spread across the courses to increase top speed in a manner similar to the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series.

===Re-releases===
The original &quot;Excitebike&quot; is an unlockable in Left Field Productions&#x27; &quot;Excitebike 64&quot;, which was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. It is also one of several unlockable NES games in &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; for the GameCube, released in 2001. The Nintendo 64 version restores the Save and Load functionality in Design mode, though it is limited to saving one custom track on the Game Pak, while the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; version can be transferred to the Game Boy Advance by using a link cable. &quot;Excitebike&quot; was also released for the Game Boy Advance in the form of e-Reader cards, and later as a Game Pak for the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot;.

&quot;Excitebike&quot; was added to the European Wii Virtual Console on February 16, 2007, the same day its spiritual successor, &quot;Excite Truck&quot;, was released there. The game was later added to the North American Virtual Console on March 19. It was re-released in North America for the Wii U Virtual Console on April 26, 2013. &quot;3D Classics: Excitebike&quot; was released on the Nintendo 3DS as a launch game for the Nintendo eShop in America, Japan and Europe; the game was initially offered for free for a period but then was sold at £5.40 / €6.00 for European markets and $5.99 in the US. It features 3D stereoscopic support and analog control support. This release was featured among other games from the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES to be released for the 3DS on a tech demo called &quot;Classic Games&quot; at E3 2010. It allows the player to save up to 32 custom created tracks that can be played in either 2D or 3D.

&quot;Excitebike&quot; is one of the 30 games available on the NES Classic Edition, released by Nintendo on November 11, 2016. &quot;VS. Excitebike&quot; was released on the Nintendo Switch in the Nintendo eShop in September 2018, by Hamster Corporation as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series under license from Nintendo.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;VS. Excitebike&quot; on its January 15, 1985, issue as the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the month. In North America, the game was number 13 on the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade software charts in December 1985. It ended the year as America&#x27;s second highest-grossing arcade system game of 1985, below Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;.

The game has received generally positive reviews. Allgame gave &quot;Excitebike&quot; its highest possible rating of five stars. The review referred to the game as a &quot;staple of any NES collection&quot;, praising its graphics as cute and its control as simple that still require strategy to apply properly. The review noted the design mode, as &quot;the first of its kind in a console game, and greatly extends the life of the title by featuring 19 different components you can piece together to build your own course&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the NES version in 2007, as &quot;ridiculously addictive&quot; and that it &quot;proves video games don&#x27;t need to have flashy graphics or complex AI to actually be fun. Sure, there are other racing games out there today, hundreds of them. This one may not necessarily be better than the recent stuff, but it&#x27;s unique, addictive, and demonstrates what gaming is really about&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Excitebike&quot; as the 14th best NES game. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked it as the 12th best game on the NES Classic Edition, saying that it has aged well with &quot;a great sense of speed while driving and an excellent sense of balance while jumping and landing&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked the game 44 on its top 100 games of all time.

&quot;Kotaku&quot; editor Jason Schreier ranked it as the worst game on the NES Classic Edition, calling it &quot;a truly awful video game&quot; but with no explanation.

==Legacy==
The side-scrolling gameplay of &quot;Excitebike&quot; was key to the development of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985). The same Miyamoto-led team that developed &quot;Excitebike&quot; went on to develop a 1985 NES port of side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up arcade game &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984) called &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Miyamoto&#x27;s team used the technical knowledge they had gained from working on both side-scrollers to further advance the platforming &quot;athletic game&quot; genre they had created with &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) and were key steps towards Miyamoto&#x27;s vision of an expansive side-scrolling platformer. While working on &quot;Excitebike&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, he devised the concept of a platformer in which the player can &quot;strategize while scrolling sideways&quot; over long distances, and has colorful backgrounds rather than black. &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; utilized the fast scrolling game engine Miyamoto&#x27;s team had originally developed for &quot;Excitebike&quot;, which allowed Mario to smoothly accelerate from a walk to a run, rather than move at a constant speed like in earlier platformers.

&quot;Excitebike&quot; spawned several sequels, including &quot;Excitebike 64&quot; (2000), &quot;Excite Truck&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2009), and the WiiWare game &quot;&quot; (2009). An &quot;Excitebike&quot;-themed track is downloadable content in &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; and is available by default in &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;. A group of Excitebike racers cameo as an Assist Trophy in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;.

<doc id="583405" wikidata="Q1772448" url="?curid=583405" title="Coma (optics)">
<text>In optics (especially telescopes), the coma (), or comatic aberration, in an optical system refers to aberration inherent to certain optical designs or due to imperfection in the lens or other components that results in off-axis point sources such as stars appearing distorted, appearing to have a tail (coma) like a comet. Specifically, coma is defined as a variation in magnification over the entrance pupil. In refractive or diffractive optical systems, especially those imaging a wide spectral range, coma can be a function of wavelength, in which case it is also a form of chromatic aberration.

==Overview==
Coma is an inherent property of telescopes using parabolic mirrors. Unlike a spherical mirror, a bundle of parallel rays parallel to the optical axis will be perfectly focused to a point (the mirror is free of spherical aberration), no matter where they strike the mirror. However, this is only true if the rays are parallel to the axis of the parabola. When the incoming rays strike the mirror at an angle, individual rays are not reflected to the same point. When looking at a point that is not perfectly aligned with the optical axis, some of the incoming light from that point will strike the mirror at an angle. This causes an image that is not in the center of the field to appear as wedge-shaped. The further off-axis (or the greater the angle subtended by the point with the optical axis), the worse this effect is. This causes stars to appear to have a cometary coma, hence the name.

Schemes to reduce coma without introducing spherical aberration include Schmidt, Maksutov, ACF and Ritchey–Chrétien optical systems. Correction lenses, &quot;coma correctors&quot; for Newtonian reflectors have been designed which reduce coma in newtonian telescopes. These work by means of a dual lens system of a plano-convex and a plano-concave lens fitted into an eyepiece adaptor which superficially resembles a Barlow lens.

Coma of a single lens or a system of lenses can be minimized (and in some cases eliminated) by choosing the curvature of the lens surfaces to match the application. Lenses in which both spherical aberration and coma are minimized at a single wavelength are called &quot;bestform&quot; or &quot;aplanatic&quot; lenses.

==In human vision==

Vertical coma is the most common higher-order aberration in the eyes of patients with keratoconus. Coma is also a common temporary symptom of corneal injuries or abrasions, in which case the visual defect gradually resolves as the cornea heals.

<doc id="583407" wikidata="Q514701" url="?curid=583407" title="Return to Oz">
<text>Return to Oz is a 1985 dark fantasy film released by Walt Disney Pictures, co-written and directed by Walter Murch. It stars Nicol Williamson, Jean Marsh, Piper Laurie, and Fairuza Balk as Dorothy Gale in her first screen role. The film is an unofficial sequel to the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; and it is based on L. Frank Baum&#x27;s early 20th century &quot;Oz&quot; novels, mainly being a combination of &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904) and &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907). In the plot, an insomniac Dorothy returns to the Land of Oz to find it has been conquered by the wicked Nome King and his accomplice Princess Mombi. Dorothy must restore Oz with her new friends Billina, Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump.

In 1954, Walt Disney Productions bought the film rights to Baum&#x27;s remaining &quot;Oz&quot; books to use in the television series &quot;Disneyland;&quot; this led to the proposed live-action film &quot;The Rainbow Road to Oz&quot;, which was never completed. Murch suggested making another &quot;Oz&quot; film in 1980. Disney approved the project as they were due to lose the film rights to the series. Though MGM was not involved in the production, Disney had to pay a large fee to use the ruby slippers created for the 1939 film. &quot;Return to Oz&quot; fell behind schedule during production, and, following a change of Disney management, Murch was briefly fired.

&quot;Return to Oz&quot; was released in theaters on June 21, 1985. It performed poorly at the box office, grossing $11.1 million in the United States on a $28 million budget, and received mixed reviews, with critics praising the effects and performances but criticizing the dark content and twisted visuals. However, it performed well outside the US, and has since acquired a cult following from fans of the Oz books who regard it as more faithful to L. Frank Baum&#x27;s works than the 1939 film. It received an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects.

==Plot==

Six months after the tornado strike, Dorothy Gale&#x27;s Aunt Em and Uncle Henry take her to the sanatorium of Dr. Worley, concerned that her continued obsession with the Land of Oz is a sign of delusion. Worley and his assistant, Nurse Wilson, plan to administer electrotherapy to Dorothy, before lightning causes a power failure. Dorothy is rescued by a mysterious girl, who tells her Worley&#x27;s machines damage patients, and the two escape. Nurse Wilson chases the girls into a river, where Dorothy floats away on a chicken coop, but the other girl isn&#x27;t seen resurfacing.

Dorothy awakens in Oz with her chicken, Billina, who can now talk. They follow a damaged yellow brick road to the Emerald City, which is in ruins and its citizens, including the Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, turned to stone. The Wheelers - people with wheels instead of hands and feet - seize them but they are saved by a mechanical man, Tik-Tok, who explains he was told by Scarecrow, the king of Oz, to await Dorothy&#x27;s return. In search of Scarecrow they visit Princess Mombi in her castle, where she keeps her collection of &quot;wearable&quot; heads. After revealing that Scarecrow is being held prisoner by the Nome King, who is also responsible for the devastation of Oz, she imprisons the group, intending to take Dorothy&#x27;s head for her collection.

Locked in a tower the group encounter Jack Pumpkinhead, who explains he was brought to life by Mombi&#x27;s Powder of Life. Dorothy steals the powder from Mombi to construct a flying creature from furniture and the head of the Gump, a moose-like animal, which flies them across the Deadly Desert to the Nome King&#x27;s mountain, pursued by Mombi and the Wheelers. The Gump eventually crashes on the mountain, where Dorothy is briefly reunited with Scarecrow, before the Nome King turns him into an ornament. The Nome King makes each of the group enter a room full of ornaments and make three guesses as to which is Scarecrow, but The Gump, Jack and Tik-Tok all fail and are turned into ornaments themselves.

Before Dorothy begins her turn the Nome King reveals he has her lost ruby slippers, which he used to conquer Oz, and offers to use them to send her home instead, but Dorothy refuses. With her third and final guess she selects a green gem, which turns into Scarecrow. Realising inhabitants of Oz turn into green objects, Dorothy finds and restores Jack and the Gump. Enraged, the Nome King imprisons Mombi as punishment for Dorothy’s escape, then grows to gigantic size and attempts to eat the group until Billina lays an egg in his mouth, poisoning him. Dorothy retrieves the ruby slippers and hurriedly puts them on as the subterranean Nome kingdom collapses. She wishes for the group to return to a restored Emerald City, where she restores a green medal on Gump&#x27;s antler into Tik-Tok.

The people of Oz subsequently ask Dorothy to be their Queen, but she desires to return home, while Billina chooses to stay. Princess Ozma - the girl from the sanitarium and rightful ruler of Oz, who was imprisoned in a mirror by Mombi - is then freed and ascends the throne. Dorothy gives Ozma the ruby slippers, which she uses to send Dorothy home, promising she can return in the future if she wishes. Dorothy is found by her family on a riverbank in Kansas, where Aunt Em tells her that the clinic burned down, with everyone except Worley surviving. Nurse Wilson is arrested for her part in Worley’s experiments. Returning home, Dorothy sees Billina and Ozma through her bedroom mirror and calls for Aunt Em, but they signal for her to keep Oz a secret. Dorothy then goes outside and plays with her dog Toto.

===Development===
Walter Murch began development of &quot;Return to Oz&quot; in 1980, during a brainstorming session with Walt Disney Productions production chief Tom Wilhite. Murch told Wilhite he was interested in making an &quot;Oz&quot; film and Wilhite &quot;sort of straightened up in his chair&quot;. Unbeknownst to Murch, Disney owned the rights to the &quot;Oz&quot; series and wanted to make a new film as the copyright was soon to expire. In September 1981, Disney president Ron W. Miller announced that the studio would be making the film, not as a sequel or continuation of the 1939 movie, but instead an entirely new story with a different look from the original film.

&quot;Return to Oz&quot; is based on the second and third &quot;Oz&quot; books, &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904) and &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907). The element about Tik-Tok being &quot;The Royal Army of Oz&quot; derives from &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914), in which he is made the Royal Army of Oogaboo and also makes frequent cries of &quot;Pick me up!&quot; That book was itself based on a dramatic production, &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot; (1913). Murch also used the book &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; as a historical source for the film. Murch co-wrote the screenplay with Gill Dennis, intentionally writing a film that was unlike the original to avoid accusations of blasphemy. Executive Producer Gary Kurtz noted, &quot;We&#x27;re not trying to make a sequel, although technically the books are sequels to each other&quot;, suggesting that the movie would be more faithful to the books than the 1939 film was.

Murch took a darker take on Baum&#x27;s source material than the 1939 adaptation, which he knew would be a gamble. Between the development period and actual shooting, there was a change of leadership at the Walt Disney studios (with Wilhite replaced by Richard Berger), and the film&#x27;s budget increased. Despite an original $20 million budget, this eventually rose to $28 million.

The film was developed and produced without the involvement of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio behind the 1939 film. No approval was necessary because, by 1985, the &quot;Oz&quot; books on which it was based were in the public domain, and the subsequent &quot;Oz&quot; books had been optioned to Disney many years earlier. The ruby slippers were created by MGM specifically for the 1939 film to replace the Silver Shoes of the original stories and, as the slippers remained MGM&#x27;s intellectual property, a fee was paid. Another carry-over from the 1939 film was the framework in which real characters from Kansas reappeared in Oz, which Murch kept in order to keep harmony between the two films.

Fairuza Balk was one of 600 from Vancouver chosen to audition for the role of Dorothy. Having spent four days in Los Angeles during November 1983, she learned she had secured the role the following month. Speaking of the audition process, Balk said &quot;I just burst with tears because I was so happy. It was a really big thing for me even to get an audition for a real feature film.&quot; In casting the relatively unknown Balk, who was the second youngest auditionee from around 1,000 children auditioned across eight cities, Murch said he &quot;wanted to find somebody who might be Judy Garland&#x27;s cousin once removed.&quot; Maslansky believed Balk was born to play the role, saying &quot;She is Dorothy as described by Baum. She is also Dorothy as I think Judy Garland would have loved to play her if she were that age.&quot;

Emma Ridley was cast in the role of Ozma, which she described as &quot;a dream come true&quot;. In preparation for the role, she would watch visual adaptions of the story and analyzed the opinions of critics of Ozma. Ridley described how she tried to make her Kansas character &quot;very calm, very studious&quot;, opting to wear little makeup and perform barefoot, while wanting a complete difference for Ozma, who was shown with a transformed appearance and attire. There was a gap of several months between Ridley filming the Kansas scenes and the Oz scenes. Ridley, who was born in London, had her voice in the film dubbed by Beatrice Murch, daughter of Walter Murch, so that the character of Ozma would have an American-sounding voice.

Leo McKern and Christopher Lloyd were each considered for the role of Dr. J. B. Worley/The Nome King before Nicol Williamson was cast.

For the role of Billina, around 40 real chickens were available during filming, each being good for different things. Cages were tagged with the chicken&#x27;s purpose, including perch, sit, carry and run to name a few, as well as chickens that would attack and others to run towards cast members. As Balk&#x27;s small arms could not handle carrying a full-size chicken, a smaller one was used for those scenes. A mechanical chicken was also used for certain scenes, at times behaving so similar to a real chicken that crew in the screening room were unable to tell the difference. The dog playing the role of Toto was Tansy, a brown-eyed border terrier family pet. Director Walter Murch had already seen around 50 dogs before seeing Tansy.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on February 20, 1984, and wrapped in October 1984. Originally, filming was to be shot 75% on location, including Oz-like locations in Algeria and Italy; however, due to budget restraints from Disney, the movie was filmed entirely in the United Kingdom at Elstree Studios. Kansas scenes were filmed at Salisbury Plain, which was described as a &quot;natural choice&quot; by Maslansky due to it being flat and within close proximity to London. The temperature at Salisbury Plain during filming was described by Maslansky as &quot;freezing&quot;, saying of Balk that &quot;she would cry from the cold, from the pain of the cold – but she would never complain.&quot; The original cameraman, Freddie Francis, quit after shooting the Kansas scenes due to impatience with Murch.

Once shooting began, Murch began to fall behind schedule, and there was further pressure from the studio. Five weeks into production, Disney was unhappy with the footage. By then, mostly the Kansas scenes had been shot; however, Murch was looking unwell and was fired from the role without protestation. Murch later recalled the experience, saying &quot;had I fought back... they might have said OK, but I couldn&#x27;t fight back. I felt what the soul feels after it&#x27;s left the body after a car accident — pain but tremendous relief.&quot; High-profile filmmakers including George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola supported Murch in discussions with the studio, and Murch was reinstated and finished the film. Lucas guaranteed that he would step in as replacement if any further problems emerged.

Balk and Ridley, the only two child actors on set, had limited working hours per day. Balk, who was in around 98% of all scenes, was permitted to work no more than three-and-a-half hours each day, restricted to between 9:30am to 4:30pm which included breaks and private educational tuition. Balk&#x27;s privacy was carefully guarded and she was not available to meet with journalists. While Balk did her own stunts, Ridley had a stand-in. Filming for the river scenes took place in a sound stage, described by Ridley as being &quot;like a hot Jacuzzi&quot;.

Various scenes, in particular those with the Nome King, used clay animation to achieve the desired effect. When interviewed in 2020, director and animator Doug Aberle explained the process involved in animating the Nome King and other characters with clay, including the technical difficulties encountered. Each section, such as the outside rocks with faces on, was allocated to an animator. Nome King scenes in the throne room were animated progressively, with the character initially made entirely of clay, progressing gradually closer to human form until finally portrayed by Nicol Williamson in live action. Towards the end of the film when the Nome King crumbles, Aberle explains how it took him four attempts to animate this accurately.

The Emerald City scenes towards the end of film had to be fully reshot, as the character of Ozma was originally dressed in a gold lace dress which was deemed unsuitable during post-production. The scenes were re-shot with the actress wearing a white and green dress, described by Ridley as being &quot;very itchy and very uncomfortable&quot;, as she had grown by the time filming took place. At one point during filming these scenes, Balk collapsed due to the high on-set temperature.

===Post-production===
On describing the movie compared with the 1939 version, Balk said &quot;it&#x27;s a different story and a different picture, and I didn&#x27;t try to copy anything Judy Garland did. It&#x27;s not that much scarier, but it isn&#x27;t as bright.&quot; She enjoyed working with the cast of 30 chickens, describing them as &quot;really sweet&quot; and praising their acting ability. Jean Marsh said she thought &quot;Return to Oz&quot; would be easy to film, noting &quot;I thought this picture would be a breeze, but it&#x27;s difficult to hit it absolutely right.&quot; She trusted Murch&#x27;s direction in making his dream a reality, describing him &quot;like a mad, vague professor. He&#x27;s totally original.&quot;

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Return to Oz&quot; had its world premiere in the United States on June 21, 1985, opening in 1,300 theaters including the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Disney spent approximately $6 million on printing and advertising to promote the film, as well as adding a scene on a &quot;Return to Oz&quot; float, including characters from the film which appeared as part of Disneyland&#x27;s Main Street Electrical Parade. The film was released in London cinemas on July 11, 1985. This was the first film to use the Walt Disney Pictures logo from 1985 to 2006, which would later receive a fanfare, based on &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, composed by John Debney, with &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;.

===Home media===
The film has been released to VHS, Betamax, Laserdisc, DVD, and Blu-ray over the years. The initial release, to VHS, Laserdisc, and Beta, occurred in December 1985 shortly after the theatrical release, with the VHS initially priced with a list price of $79.95. Disney reissued it in 1992 with alternate cover art. In 1999, Anchor Bay Entertainment, who had obtained the home video rights to several titles from Disney&#x27;s live-action catalogue, issued the film on full-screen and letterbox VHS, as well as a DVD release featuring both versions. All three releases featured an intro by Fairuza Balk before the film and an interview featurette with her after it. All three versions went out of print shortly after their release.

In 2004, Disney released their own DVD, which dropped the Anchor Bay disc&#x27;s fullscreen version and added anamorphic enhancement for 16:9 TVs for the widescreen version, upgraded the audio to 5.1 surround, retained the Anchor Bay disc&#x27;s extras, and added four TV spots and a theatrical trailer. In 2015, Disney released a 30th Anniversary Edition of the film on Blu-ray exclusively through the Disney Movie Club, featuring a newly remastered and cleaned up transfer and DTS Master Audio 5.1 sound, but none of the bonus features from the 2004 DVD.

It is featured in the &quot;From the Vault&quot; Film section of Disney&#x27;s streaming platform, Disney+.

==Reception==
===Box office===
It earned $2,844,895 in its opening weekend, finishing in seventh place and $6.5 million in the 10 days after release. After the opening weekend, Commonwealth Theaters reported that some venues took between just $300–$400, considered at the time to be poor. Jeff Love, city manager of the theater chain, believed it may have been due to a bad release time, suggesting that &quot;they should have released it when people didn&#x27;t have anything to do. It should have been before people got out and started going on vacation&quot;. Love went on to suggest that the perception of it being a children&#x27;s film was another problem&quot;. It ultimately grossed $11,137,801 in North America.

===Critical response===
Receiving mixed reviews, the film critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes records 58% positive reviews based on 38 reviews, its critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Return to Oz&quot; taps into the darker side of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s book series with an intermittently dazzling adventure that never quite recaptures the magic of its classic predecessor.&quot; Those who were familiar with the Oz books praised its faithfulness to the source material of L. Frank Baum such as author and critic Harlan Ellison who said, &quot;It ain&#x27;t Judy Garland. It ain&#x27;t hip-hop. But it&#x27;s in the tradition of the original Oz books.&quot;

However, many critics described its tone and overall content as too dark and intense for young children. &quot;Children are sure to be startled by its bleakness,&quot; said &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Janet Maslin. Ian Nathan of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three out of five stars, saying: &quot;This is not so much a sequel but an homage and not a good one.&quot; Canadian film critic Jay Scott felt the protagonists were too creepy and weird for viewers to relate or sympathize with: &quot;Dorothy&#x27;s friends are as weird as her enemies, which is faithful to the original Oz books but turns out not to be a virtue on film, where the eerie has a tendency to remain eerie no matter how often we&#x27;re told it&#x27;s not.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s bleak, creepy, and occasionally terrifying,&quot; added Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. Amelie Gillette of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; frequently refers to its dark nature as unsuitable for its intended audience of young children although it had been one of her favorite movies growing up. Other reviews described the movie as &quot;a horror show flying under the banner of family entertainment.&quot;

Neil Gaiman reviewed &quot;Return to Oz&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Terrifying and visionary, funny and exciting, Return to Oz is one of the very best fantasy films I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

By the time of the film&#x27;s release, Ray Bolger, one of the surviving cast members from the 1939 film, said in an interview that although he had no desire to watch the film, he noted that &quot;they have a beautiful young lady as Dorothy and what I&#x27;ve seen of the film looks intriguing. It might be interesting for today&#x27;s young people to see another version of the story.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects, but lost to &quot;Cocoon&quot;. The nomination was given to Will Vinton, Ian Wingrove, Zoran Perisic and Michael Lloyd. Fairuza Balk and Emma Ridley were nominated for Young Artist Awards and multiple Youthies. It received two Saturn Award nominations for Best Fantasy Film (losing to &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;) and Best Younger Actor for Fairuza Balk (who lost to Barret Oliver for &quot;D.A.R.Y.L.&quot;).

<doc id="583413" wikidata="Q1340614" url="?curid=583413" title="Griffith Park">
<text>Griffith Park is a large municipal park at the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains, in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The park includes popular attractions such as the Los Angeles Zoo, the Autry Museum of the American West, the Griffith Observatory, and the Hollywood Sign. Due to its appearance in many films, the park is among the most famous municipal parks in North America.

It has been compared to Central Park in New York City and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, but it is much larger, less tamed, and more rugged than either of those parks. The Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Commission adopted the characterization of the park as an &quot;urban wilderness&quot; on January 8, 2014. The park covers of land, making it one of the largest urban parks in North America. It is the second-largest city park in California, after Mission Trails Preserve in San Diego, and the 11th-largest municipally-owned park in the United States.

==History==
===Griffith donation===
After successfully investing in mining, Griffith J. Griffith purchased Rancho Los Feliz (near the Los Angeles River) in 1882 and started an ostrich farm there. Although ostrich feathers were commonly used in making women&#x27;s hats in the late 19th century, Griffith&#x27;s purpose was primarily to lure residents of Los Angeles to his nearby property developments, which supposedly were haunted by the ghost of Antonio Feliz (a previous owner of the property). After the property rush peaked, Griffith donated to the city of Los Angeles on December 16, 1896. It came with instructions: &quot;Public parks are a safety valve of great cities...and should be accessible and attractive, where neither race, creed nor color should be excluded.&quot;

Griffith was tried and convicted of shooting and severely wounding his wife in a 1903 incident. When released from prison, he attempted to fund the construction of an amphitheater, observatory, planetarium, and a girls&#x27; camp and boys&#x27; camp in the park. As his reputation in the city was tainted by his crime, the city refused his money.

===Griffith Park Aerodrome===
In 1912, Griffith designated of the park, at its northeast corner along the Los Angeles River, to be used to &quot;do something to further aviation&quot;. The Griffith Park Aerodrome was the result. Aviation pioneers such as Glenn L. Martin and Silas Christofferson used it; afterwards the aerodrome was passed to the National Guard Air Service. Air operations continued on a -long runway until 1939, when it was closed, partly due to danger from interference with the approaches to Grand Central Airport across the river in Glendale, and because the City Planning commission complained that a military airport violated the terms of Griffith&#x27;s deed. The National Guard squadron moved to Van Nuys, and the aerodrome was demolished, though the rotating beacon and its tower remained for many years. From 1946 until the mid-1950s, Rodger Young Village occupied the area which had formerly been the Aerodrome. Today that site is occupied by the Los Angeles Zoo parking lot, the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, soccer fields, and the interchange between the Golden State Freeway and the Ventura Freeway.

===Expansion===

Griffith set up a trust fund for the improvements he envisioned, and after his death in 1919 the city began to build what Griffith had wanted. The amphitheater, called the Greek Theatre, was completed in 1930, and Griffith Observatory was finished in 1935. Subsequent to Griffith&#x27;s original gift, further donations of land, city purchases, and the reversion of land from private to public have expanded the park to its present size.

In December, 1944 the Sherman Company donated of Hollywoodland open space to Griffith Park. This large, passive, eco-sensitive property borders the Lake Hollywood reservoir (west), the former Hollywoodland sign (north), and Bronson Canyon (east) where it connects into the original Griffith donation. The Hollywoodland residential community is surrounded by this land.

===World War II===
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Civilian Conservation Corps camp contained within Griffith Park was converted to a holding center for Japanese Americans arrested as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; before they were transferred to more permanent internment camps. The Griffith Park Detention Camp opened almost immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack, taking in 35 Japanese immigrants suspected of fifth column activity because they lived and worked near military installations. These men, mostly fishermen from nearby Terminal Island, were transferred to an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention station after a brief stay, but Issei internees arrested in the days and weeks following the outbreak of the war arrived soon after to take their place. Up to 550 Japanese Americans were confined in Griffith Park from 1941 to 1942, all subsequently transferred to Fort Lincoln, Fort Missoula and other DOJ camps.

On July 14, 1942, the detention camp became a POW Processing Center for German, Italian and Japanese prisoners-of-war, operating until August 3, 1943, when the prisoners were transferred elsewhere. The camp was changed to the Army Western Corps Photographic Center and Camouflage Experimental Laboratory until the end of the war.

===Protest===
On 17 March 1968, in Los Angeles, to protest entrapment and harassment by the Los Angeles Police Department, two drag queens known as &quot;The Princess&quot; and &quot;The Duchess&quot; held a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day party at Griffith Park, a popular cruising spot and a frequent target of police activity. More than 200 gay men socialized through the day.

===Fires===

Hired as part of a welfare project, 3,780 men were in the park clearing brush on October 3, 1933, when a fire broke out in the Mineral Wells area in the northern part of the current park. Many of the workers volunteered or were ordered to fight the fire. In all, 29 men were killed and 150 were injured. Professional firefighters arrived and limited the blaze to .

On May 12, 1961, a wildfire on the south side of the park burned . It also destroyed eight homes and damaged nine more, chiefly in the Beachwood Canyon area.

Another fire occurred in the Toyon Canyon area. Repelled by the ugliness of the devastated area, Amir Dialameh replanted a portion of it himself by hand. Over the course of more than 30 years he tended the garden he built there, with the help of occasional volunteers. Amir&#x27;s Garden is featured in &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot; episode 1306.

On May 8, 2007, a major wildfire burned more than , destroying the bird sanctuary, Dante&#x27;s View, and Captain&#x27;s Roost, and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people. The fire came right up to one of the largest playgrounds in Los Angeles, Shane&#x27;s Inspiration, and the Los Angeles Zoo, and threatened the Griffith Observatory, but left such areas intact. Several local organizations, including SaveGriffithPark.org, have been working since then with local officials to restore the park in a way that would benefit all. It was the third fire of the year. The city announced a $50 million plan to stabilize the burned slopes. The trees along Canyon Drive were allowed to grow back naturally, having been re-seeded by bird droppings.

===Addition of Cahuenga Peak===
 around Cahuenga Peak were purchased with funds from a broad spectrum of donors, in addition to $1.7 million from the city, and added to the park in July 2010 bringing the park&#x27;s total acreage to .

==Attractions==
*Autry Museum of the American West
*Bronson Canyon
*Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)
*Griffith Observatory
*La Kretz Bridge
*Griffith Park &amp; Southern Railroad
*Griffith Park Merry-Go-Round
*Griffith Park Zoo - closed in 1966 and now used as a hiking and picnicking area
*Heritage tree: a pine tree in memory of Beatle George Harrison was planted in 2004 near the observatory. It died after a beetle infestation, and as of 2014, plans have been made to replace it.
*The site of the Hollywood Sign on the southern side of Mount Lee is located on rough, steep terrain, and is encompassed by barriers to prevent unauthorized access. Local groups have campaigned to make tourist access to the sign difficult on grounds of safety, as the curving hillside roads in the area were not designed for so many cars and pedestrians. The Hollywood Sign Trust convinced Google and other mapping services to stop providing directions to the location of the sign, instead directing visitors to two viewing platforms, Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood and Highland Center. Another, less remote area from which the sign can be viewed is Lake Hollywood Park on Canyon Lake Drive.
*Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum
*Los Angeles Zoo
*Travel Town Museum

A statue of a standing bear, created in 1976 by Noack Foundry based on the design of German sculptor Renée Sintenis originally created in 1932, is located in the park. Its plaque reads &quot;To the people of the United States of America in gratitude for their aid, friendship and protection. Presented to our sister city, Los Angeles by the people of free Berlin&quot;. This is the same bear as that used to create the Golden Bear awards for the Berlin International Film Festival each year.

===Other activities===
Much of the park comprises wild, rugged natural areas with hiking and equestrian trails, and this terrain separates the park into many areas or &quot;pockets&quot; of activities. Within the various areas are concessions, golf courses, picnic grounds, train rides, and tennis courts. In 2014, two baseball fields were proposed on the east side of Griffith Park that would remove 44 trees and replace of picnic area, the largest picnic area in the park that is often used for large family gatherings, cultural fairs and festivals, reunions, and other special occasions. The plan may be altered to spare a sycamore that has been designated by the city as a &quot;heritage tree&quot;, a living artifact of Los Angeles history.

After its closure in 1966, the grounds of the Griffith Park Zoo were transformed into a recreation area. Some of the former animal enclosures were left in place, and picnic tables were installed.

The annual Bell-Jeff Invitational cross country race has been held in the park on the last Saturday in September since 1973.

After 74 years in operation, the Griffith Park Pony Rides closed on December 21, 2022.

===Hiking===

Griffith Park is a popular hiking area. Orientation maps are located at the entrance to the parking lot near Griffith Observatory. A service road leads from the observatory to numerous hiking routs on and around Mount Lee; however, the immediate area where the Hollywood Sign is located is closed to the public since the area is home to the main communication tower for the City of Los Angeles. Hiking up to Wisdom tree on Cahuenga Peak from the South-western slopes of Mount Lee is accessible. Visitors are expected to comply with safety requirements, and must be prepared and equipped adequately.

Trails leading to the Hollywood Sign can be accessed from several official Griffith Park entrances. These include the Mt. Hollywood Trail, which can be accessed from the Griffith Observatory parking lot off Vermont Canyon Road or from Vermont Canyon Road just past the Greek Theater, the Bronson Canyon / Brush Canyon Trail (3200 Canyon Drive, Los Angeles, CA), and a number of trailheads that begin near the Griffith Park Visitors Center off Crystal Springs Drive in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles (free trail maps are available at the Visitors Center). A once-popular trailhead originating at the top of Beachwood Drive was closed by court order in April 2017.

===Mount Lee===
Mount Lee&#x27;s hiking trails and fire roads are part of Griffith Park; as such it&#x27;s easy to get lost and be redirected. Maps of the trails and the land around the hills should be studied before attempting to hike the area for the first time.

==Wildlife==
An adult mountain lion, named P-22, inhabited the park from 2012 to 2022. An image of the cougar was captured on an automatic camera. P-22 is likely not the first mountain lion to have taken up residence in Griffith Park, although the duration of his stay was remarkably long. A mountain lion&#x27;s body was found in Griffith Park sometime in 1996 or 1997, after being hit by a vehicle. Another mountain lion was sighted several times in Griffith Park in 2004 and rangers found evidence (including deer remains) to support its presence there.

An urban ecologist monitors wildlife within the park. The ecologist has also been conducting a raptor study in the communities surrounding the park through volunteers since 2017. Permanent signs on the Griffith Park Observatory deck warn of rattlesnakes in the surrounding area.

Urban coyotes abound in Griffith Park and are generally active at night. Park visitors report frequent sightings during the day and have had their dogs attacked by coyotes. Visitors are strongly discouraged from feeding Griffith Park coyotes including near &quot;the base of Fern Canyon, where up to eight coyotes per day are present more or less continuously.&quot;

The newly created habitat of a Miyawaki forest near the Bette Davis Picnic Area has attracted Western toads from the Los Angeles River.

==Geology==
Much of the exposed rock in Griffith Park is marine or non-marine sedimentary rock of Neogene and Quaternary formations, including the Lower, Middle and Upper Topanga, as well as the Monterey and Fernando formations. Both inclined bedding and fossil-bearing strata are common. Also present is late Miocene intrusive rock, generally strongly weathered and easily cleaved, as well as some dikes and purple and gray andesitic extrusive rock bodies. Faulting as well as clear contacts between rock bodies are also common.

===Climate===
==In popular culture==
With its wide variety of scenes and close proximity to Hollywood and Burbank, various locations in the park have been used extensively in movies and television shows. Griffith Park was the busiest destination in Los Angeles for on-location filming in 2011, with 346 production days, according to a FilmL.A. survey. Projects included the TV series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; and &quot;The Closer&quot;.


Some sites within the park that have appeared in media include:
*Bronson Canyon, also called Bronson Caves, is a popular location for motion picture and television filming, especially of western and science fiction low-budget films, including &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956). The site was also used as the location for the climactic scene in John Ford&#x27;s classic western, &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956). The scene includes Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) cornering his niece Debbie (Natalie Wood) in one of the caves with the apparent intent of killing her. The craggy site of an old quarry, a tunnel in this canyon was also used as the entrance to the Batcave in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series, and in numerous other shows. The natural &quot;cave&quot; walls are preserved by the many layers of paint used to make them look like rock.
* The Griffith Observatory, which sits atop the southern slope of Mount Hollywood, was featured prominently in the classic &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955). A bronze bust of the film&#x27;s star James Dean is on the grounds just outside the dome. Other movies filmed here include &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991), Stephen Sommer&#x27;s film &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004), &quot;Yes Man&quot; (2008), and &quot;La La Land&quot; (2016). The area of the park around the Observatory also appears as a location in the role-playing video game &quot;&quot; (2004), which is set in Los Angeles. Griffith Park and Griffith Observatory are significant in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Future&#x27;s End&quot; (originally aired November 6, 1996). The crew are thrown into the past and Griffith Observatory discovers &quot;Voyager&quot;. The tunnel was also used in the 1960s spy television series &quot;&quot;.
*The Griffith Park Carousel, opened in 1929 was the carousel that inspired Disneyland. Walt sat on one of the benches around the Carousel, and while watching his kids dreamed up Disneyland. The Carousel is still open, and enriched with history. 
* Films:
** D.W. Griffith (no relation to the eponym of Griffith Park) filmed the battle scenes for his epic &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; in the park in 1915, as Lillian Gish detailed in her memoirs, &quot;The Movies, Mr. Griffith, and Me&quot;.
**It was used for the road scenes in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950).

<text>Jet Airways Limited, trading as Jet Airways, was an Indian full-service airline based in Delhi, with a training and developmental centre in Mumbai. Incorporated in April 1993 as a limited liability company, the airline began operations as an air taxi operator in 1993. It began full operations in 1995, with international flights introduced in 2004. The airline went public in 2005 and in 2007, when it acquired Air Sahara. The airline was expected to re-commence its flight operations by the end of 2024, which would have made it the first Indian airline to be revived after ceasing operations. On 7th November, 2024, the liquidation of the airline was ordered by the Supreme Court of India. 

It grew to be one of the largest airlines in India, with a 21.2% passenger market share in February 2016. Jet Airways operated over 300 flights daily to 74 destinations worldwide from its former main hub at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai and secondary hubs at Chennai International Airport in Chennai, Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi, Kempegowda International Airport in Bangalore, Cochin International Airport in Kochi and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata.

With its competitors—primarily low-cost carriers SpiceJet and IndiGo—lowering ticket fares in the following years, it was forced to follow suit, hurting overall performance resulting in steep financial losses. It dropped to second place behind IndiGo in October 2017, with a passenger market share of 17.8%. The downward slide continued and resulted in bankruptcy in 2019. Jet Airways ceased operations in April 2019.

In 2020, Jet Airways was acquired by the investment company Kalrock with plans to resume operations in 2022. However, these plans were delayed due to financial issues and ongoing proceedings with the National Company Law Tribunal. The airline was expected to restart operations by end of 2024, with Jalan-Kalrock&#x27;s ownership retained.

After years of prolonged attempts at resuscitation, the Supreme Court ordered the liquidation of airline on 7 November 2024.

==History==
The airline was granted a scheduled airline status on 14 January 1995. It entered into a marketing agreement with KLM the same year. In 1996, the airline placed a $375 million order for four 737-400 and six 737-800 aircraft from Boeing, which were delivered between 1997 and 2000. Jet Airways was the first airline in Southeast Asia to order the 737-800. In the financial year 1996–97, the airline carried 2.4 million passengers and had a market share of 20 percent, second highest after state-owned Indian Airlines. By this time, the airline had a fleet of twelve Boeing 737 aircraft, operating 83 daily flights to 23 domestic destinations. In 1997, the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CCFI) of the Government of India announced that foreign airlines would no longer be permitted to take an equity stake in joint ventures with Indian aviation companies, reversing the Government&#x27;s earlier policy which had allowed carriers such as Gulf Air, Kuwait Airways and Lufthansa to hold a maximum 40% equity stake in their joint ventures with Indian partners. In October 1997, as per this directive, Naresh Goyal took back control of Trade Winds from its foreign investors.

At the Paris Air Show in June 1999, Jet Airways announced an order worth approximately $550 million for ten Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The airline purchased its first Boeing 737-400 simulator from CAE Inc. in 2001. By April 2001, the airline fleet had grown to 30 aircraft and was operating over 195 flights daily to 37 destinations within India. Jet Airways suffered losses for the first time since its establishment in financial year 2001–2002 as demand fell and costs increased. It was announced as launch customer for the Embraer 175 at the Farnborough air show in 2002, with an order for ten aircraft and ten options worth $520 million; unfortunately, the deal was subsequently was held in abeyance due to the airline&#x27;s financial difficulties and eventually fell through. In 2003, the Indian government decided to allow private carriers to operate international services to countries in South Asia, such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, and Jet began preparations to launch international services. The airline launched its first international flight in March 2004 from Chennai to Colombo.

Jet Airways was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and became a public company on 28 December 2004. After the Government of India lifted the foreign ownership limits on Indian airlines to 49% from the previous 40%, the airline moved to raise funds via an IPO. The company&#x27;s IPO in February 2005—which offered 20% of the airline&#x27;s stock—saw strong interest from investors leading to oversubscription in retail, non-institutional and institutional tranches and raised ₹18.9 billion, instantly making Naresh Goyal a paper billionaire. Towards the end of 2004, the government announced that privately owned scheduled carriers meeting certain criteria could operate to all countries apart from those in the Middle East. Thereafter, in January 2005, the Ministry of Civil Aviation granted rights to Jet Airways to operate services to London Heathrow. The airline started its first international, long-haul flight to London in May 2005 with two-class Airbus A340-300s sub-leased from South African Airways.

===Growth and expansion===
In January 2006, Jet Airways announced its intention to acquire Air Sahara for in an all-cash deal; however, the deal fell through in June 2006. On 12 April 2007, the deal was back on track with Jet Airways agreeing to pay . On 16 April 2007, Air Sahara was renamed as JetLite and was marketed between a low-cost carrier and a full-service airline. JetLite became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jet Airways. In August 2008, Jet Airways announced its plans to integrate JetLite into Jet Airways. In October 2008, Jet Airways laid off 1,900 of its employees, who were later reinstated after the Ministry of Civil Aviation&#x27;s intervention. In October 2008, the airline entered into an alliance with rival Kingfisher Airlines for code-sharing on domestic and international flights, collaboration on frequent-flyer program, and sharing crew and ground handling equipment. On 8 May 2009, Jet Airways launched another low-cost brand, Jet Konnect. It operated a fleet of Boeing 737 Next Generation and ATR 72 aircraft and operated on profitable short-haul routes with higher passenger load factors.

===Consolidation===
In the third quarter of 2010, Jet Airways became the largest airline in India with a passenger market share of 22.6%. In July 2012, the airline officially sought government approval to join Star Alliance. Jet Airways is not a member of Star Alliance as of 2017. In June 2011, it became the first domestic airline in India to ban meat products and liquids in check-in baggage. Jet Airways merged the JetLite brand into Jet Konnect on 25 March 2012 and began offering business-class seats after the demise of Kingfisher Airlines. In 2013, Etihad Airways planned to buy a stake in the airline following the government&#x27;s announcement in September 2012 that foreign airlines could take a stake of up to 49% in Indian carriers. On 24 April 2013, Jet announced that it was ready to sell a 24% stake in the airline to Etihad for . The deal, which was expected to be signed in January 2013, was deferred, and was eventually inked on 12 November 2013. Naresh Goyal retained 51% ownership of the stock. In 2013, the airline lowered prices and entered into a fare war with low-cost carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet due to falling passenger demand. In February 2013, the airline&#x27;s market value dropped by due to falling share prices. Jet Airways made profits in the third quarter of the financial year 2013–14, after posting losses over the previous year. The airline announced on 11 August 2014 that it would phase out Jet Konnect by the end of the year as part of plans to reposition itself as a uniform full-service operator. On 1 December 2014, Jet Konnect was fully merged with Jet Airways, making it the third full-service airline in India besides Air India and Vistara. In December 2015, Jet Airways announced the closure of its scissor hub at Brussels Airport by March 2016 and the inauguration of a new hub at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, effective 27 March 2016. As of February 2016, it was the second-largest airline in India after IndiGo, with a 21.2% passenger-market share.

===Bankruptcy and cessation of services===
As of November 2018, Jet Airways was reported to have a negative financial outlook due to increasing losses. In March 2019, it was reported that nearly a fourth of Jet Airways&#x27; aircraft inventory was grounded due to unpaid lease rates. On 25 March 2019, Mr. Naresh Goyal and his wife Anitha Goyal stepped down from the board of directors.

On 5 April 2019, Indian Oil Corporation stopped supplying fuel to Jet Airways, citing non-payment of dues as the emergency funds have still not been credited. On 17 April 2019, Jet Airways suspended all flight operations after lenders spurned a ₹4 billion emergency funding request, and its membership in the International Air Transport Association (IATA) was suspended too. On 17 June 2019, after receiving no acceptable offers from Etihad Airways and Hinduja Group, lenders of Jet Airways decided to refer the company to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for bankruptcy proceedings with debt amounting to $1.2 billion.

As the group faced insolvency proceedings in the Netherlands after failing to pay two creditors, the NCLAT allowed cross-border insolvency proceedings, stating that the &quot;Dutch Trustee (Administrator) would work in cooperation with the &#x27;Resolution Professional of India.&#x27;&quot;

In early 2020, the Enso Group attempted to rescue the airline with the Russian Far East Development Fund and participated in talks to buy a controlling stake from its committee of creditors (CoC), but the talks fell through.

===Restart===
In 2020, entrepreneur Murari Lal Jalan and asset management firm Kalrock, part of the Fritsch Group, purchased Jet Airways with a view to restart air operations. It was expected that Jet Airways II would take to the skies in 2022 as a full-service domestic airline with a fleet of six aircraft. On 20 May 2022, Jet Airways received its air operator&#x27;s certificate. However, flights did not resume in 2022, and the company did not renew its air operator&#x27;s certificate in 2023, leading to speculations that the resuscitation stalled.

In August 2023, it was reported that Jet Airways has lost its IATA code, 9W, after all flights were grounded for over four years. A Jet Airways spokesperson stated that the IATA code is &quot;currently under preservation with IATA,&quot; until operations are recommenced. As of September 2023, Jet Airways was expected to restart operations by the end of 2024, with Jalan-Kalrock&#x27;s ownership retained.

=== Liquidation ===
The Supreme Court ordered the liquidation of the airline—officially Jet Airways (India) Ltd.—on 7 November 2024. The SC overturned the decision of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal to transfer Jet Airways to the Jalan-Kalrock Consortium (JKC) and upheld the State Bank of India-led team of creditors&#x27; appeal that &quot;the consortium had failed to meet the initial financial commitments required in the resolution plan.&quot;

The main institutional shareholders included Punjab National Bank (26%), Etihad Airways (24%), and Jet’s original promoters (25%), according to the analysis. At the current market valuation of , retail shares in the airline amount to roughly .

==Livery==

The original livery was navy blue with light grey and chrome yellow. The top and bottom of the aircraft were painted light grey, with the flying sun logo on a navy blue background.

In 2007, a new livery was designed by Landor Associates was introduced, featuring yellow and gold ribbons. The design retained the dark blue and gold-accented colour scheme along with the airline&#x27;s &quot;flying sun&quot; logo. A new yellow uniform was concurrently introduced, created by Italian designer Roberto Capucci. Jet Airways introduced its new identity in conjunction with a global brand re-launch that included new aircraft and seating arrangement.

==Controversies==
===Safety===
Asmin Tariq, a contractor working for the airline as a security agent at Heathrow airport, was implicated in the foiled terror plot on 10 August 2006 to blow up several transatlantic airliners belonging to three different US airlines. Subsequently, the Governments of UK and Singapore sought security-related information from the Ministry of External Affairs of India on Jet Airways; clearance was further delayed to fly to the US. The US State Department gave the go-ahead for the airline to fly to the US on 15 November 2006.

In August 2014, two pilots of Jet Airways were suspended after a plane carrying 280 passengers dropped mid-air en route from Mumbai to Brussels.

===Customer care===
On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from Bhopal to Mumbai was held up by a large group of passengers headed for a wedding in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that the wedding party was politically-connected and attempted to coerce the cabin crew to disembark passengers so that additional members of their party could be accommodated. The airline, however, claimed it was a technical glitch in their booking system which led to overbooking.

===Corruption===
In 2016, Jet Airways was implicated in the Gupta family controversy in South Africa. Former African National Congress MP Vytjie Mentor alleged that members of the Gupta family had offered her the position of Minister of Public Enterprises on behalf of President Jacob Zuma, in exchange for her facilitating the cancellation of South African Airways’ India route so Jet Airways could take it over.

===Links to organised crime===
On 12 December 2001, an internal memo from two Indian intelligence agencies—R&amp;AW and IB—to the Home Ministry of India stated they had evidence that Jet Airways held intermittent contact with Dawood Ibrahim, Chota Shakeel, and other gangs of Indian organised crime, related to financial transactions. This information was leaked to the media and parliament proceedings were stalled. Subsequently, in 2016, reports emerged that the initial investment for Jet Airways had come through shell companies based in the Isle of Man and was heavily funded by prominent figures in Indian organised crime. This was documented in detail in the book &quot;A Feast of Vultures&quot;.

==Destinations==
According to its website, in 2016, Jet Airways served 57 destinations—37 domestic and 20 international—across 15 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East. The airline had its primary hub in Mumbai and secondary bases in Delhi and Bangalore.

The airline&#x27;s first international destination, introduced in March 2004, was Colombo, served from Chennai. Launched in 2005, London was the airline&#x27;s first long-haul destination. Since 2007, Jet Airways has had a scissors hub at Brussels Airport for onward transatlantic connections to North America, which was replaced by Amsterdam Airport Schiphol from 27 March 2016.

In 2008, the airline was forced to discontinue international routes due to losses sustained by the global economic downturn of 2007–08; it terminated services to San Francisco and Shanghai. The airline planned to restore the Mumbai–Shanghai route by the end of 2011, but it never materialised. In 2012, the airline withdrew flights to New York City and closed the Delhi–Milan route in 2013. On 1 March 2016, the airline announced the integration of domestic and international operations at Mumbai airport and moved its entire operations to the newly constructed Terminal 2.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===

After the airline was grounded owing to financial constraints, the current Jet Airways fleet consists of the following as of 2024:

===Fleet development===
Jet Airways placed its first order for four Boeing 737-400 and 30 Boeing 737-800 aircraft on 11 December 1996: the first aircraft was delivered on 12 November 1997. It placed its second order comprising six Boeing 737-700 and two Boeing 737-900 aircraft on 14 June 1999, with deliveries starting in May 2001. The airline launched its next round of fleet expansion in 2005 when it ordered 30 aircraft at the Paris Air Show. The airline signed deals with Airbus for ten A330 aircraft and with Boeing for ten 737 and 777 aircraft each. Long-haul routes were served using its fleet of Airbus A330-200, Airbus A330-300 and Boeing 777-300ER. The airline placed an order for 10 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft on 29 September 2005, which were delivered in 2007. Jet Airways ordered 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners on 29 December 2006 to operate on long-haul routes. On 5 January 2012, it inducted five ATR 72-600 series to operate on domestic regional routes. It further placed an order for 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft on 23 April 2013 as part of modernisation of its fleet of 737s. In April 2018 and July 2018, the airline entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, taking its order tally to 225 Boeing 737 MAX jets. After Jet Airways ceased operations, Boeing cancelled all of Jet Airways&#x27; remaining 737 MAX 8 orders, as well as the Boeing 737 MAX 9 and 10 orders, and Boeing 787-9 orders, due to the airline&#x27;s financial problems and eventual collapse. As a part of the airline&#x27;s relaunch, reports emerged that the airline was in talks with Airbus to procure 50 narrow body Airbus A220 aircraft. Some news reports indicated that Jalan-Kalrock was in talks with aircraft OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to place an order for at least 200 aircraft—a mix of small, medium, and large narrow-body jets—at the Paris Airshow in June 2023 as part of their five-year growth plan. However, this never materialised.

===Former fleet===
Jet Airways operated the following aircraft in the past:

==Services==

===Cabin===
Jet Airways had three classes of service: First, Première (Business) and Economy. 
*First class was available only on the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. The first class offered private suites, featuring seats that could convert into fully flat beds, personal LCD TVs, and in-seat power supply.
*Première class was available on long-haul international flights aboard Airbus A330-200 and Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, featuring recliner seats, fully flat beds with personal LCD TVs, and in-seat power. Première class on domestic flights offered recliner seats with larger leg room in a 2-2 configuration.
*Economy class on long-haul aircraft had a seat pitch with a footrest. The cabin was configured in 2-4-2 layout on the Airbus A330-200 and 3-4-3 layout on the Boeing 777-300ER. Economy seats on both the Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 sported a personal touchscreen LCD TV. Domestic flights operated by Boeing 737 aircraft had both Première and Economy classes, while the ATR 72 aircraft had an all-economy class configuration. Economy class on Boeing 737 featured a seat pitch with a personal LCD behind each seat. Meals were served in economy class until recently, when the airline introduced a buy-on-board service called Jet Bistro.

===Wi-Fi===
On 1 February 2016, Jet Airways announced the introduction of an in-flight entertainment service for streaming of entertainment content directly to Wi-Fi enabled personal devices of the passengers.

===Frequent Flyer Program===

Jet Airways&#x27;s frequent-flyer programme was called Jet Privilege. It was rebranded as Intermiles in 2019.

==Accidents and incidents==
*1 July 2007: &quot;Jet Airways Flight 3307&quot;, an ATR 72-212A (registered VT-JCE)—operating on the Bhopal-Indore route—was involved in an accident caused by bad weather. While there were no fatalities amongst the 45 passengers and four crew members, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off.
*18 August 2015: &quot;Jet Airways Flight 555,&quot; a Boeing 737-800 (registered VT-JFA)—flying on the Doha-Cochin route—was involved in a serious incident at Trivandrum Airport after diverting due to poor visibility and low fuel. The flight made 3 go-arounds when approaching Cochin Airport and 3 more at Trivandrum. Visual approaches at Trivandrum were conducted in below-minima conditions. A fuel emergency was declared after the 4th go-around when the remaining fuel dropped below the final reserve fuel of 1128 kg. The aircraft landed on runway 32 on the 7th attempt with 349 kg of fuel remaining on board. There were no injuries to the 150 passengers and crew, and the aircraft sustained no damage.
*27 December 2016: &quot;Jet Airways Flight 2374,&quot; a Boeing 737-800 (registered VT-JBG)—flying from Goa to Mumbai with 154 passengers and 7 crew—backtracked runway 26, lined up on the runway, and began accelerating the engines for takeoff. However, the aircraft continued to turn right. The crew rejected takeoff, but the aircraft veered off the right edge of the runway, almost perpendicular to it. The aircraft went over soft ground, crossed a road, and came to a stop with the nose gear collapsed and both engines making ground contact. The aircraft was evacuated, and 16 occupants sustained minor injuries during the evacuation.
*30 October 2017: &quot;Jet Airways Flight 339,&quot; a Boeing 737-900 flying from Mumbai to Delhi, was subject of a bomb hoax/hijacking hoax. Birju Kishore Salla, a jeweller from Mumbai, left a note in the business class lavatory claiming that 12 hijackers were aboard and that explosives had been placed in the cargo area, demanding that the plane be diverted to Pakistani-administered Kashmir. After the note was found, the plane was diverted for an emergency landing in Ahmedabad, whereupon bomb disposal units searched the aircraft and found that the note was a hoax. Salla was subsequently banned from flying on Jet Airways flights for five years, and became the first person to get added to the Indian No-Fly List.

<text>Heads of government in Malaysia&#x27;s many states take on various titles. Seven out of nine in the Peninsular who each have historical monarchs are known as the Menteri Besar (Jawi: , literally &quot;Grand Minister&quot; or &quot;First Minister&quot;; abbreviated as MB), while the rest in the federation are titled Chief Minister (abbreviated as CM; in Malay: &quot;Ketua Menteri;&quot; abbreviated as KM) and previously Sarawak until it was changed to the title Premier (&quot;Premier)&quot; since 2022.

For four states without a monarch, the title is used 
The nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states and the appointed governors of the other four states serve as constitutional and ceremonial heads of their states, while the state executive authority rests with the Menteris Besar, chief ministers and premier. Following elections to the state legislative assembly, the ruler or governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the state government. The ruler or governor appoints and swears in the Menteri Besar, chief ministers and premier, whose executive council (or Cabinet in Sabah and Sarawak) are collectively responsible to the assembly. Based on the Westminster system, given that he retains the confidence of the assembly, the terms of Menteris Besar, chief ministers and premier can last for the length of the assembly&#x27;s life—a maximum of five years. There are no limits to the number of terms that the Menteri Besar, chief minister and premier can serve.

==Background==
In most states within Malaysia, the office was created by the British colonial government in 1948, in tandem with the creation of the Federation of Malaya. However, Johor was the first state to create the &quot;Menteri Besar&quot; position, subject to &quot;Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor&quot; (Johor State Constitution) enforced by Sultan Abu Bakar. This had made Johor the first Malay state to adopt a system of constitutional monarchy. After Malaya gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, the office bearer is appointed among the state legislative assembly members by the Sultans. The Menteri Besar, chief minister and premier usually come from the party (or coalition) which commands a majority in the state assembly.

===Relations between the Menteris Besar, chief ministers, premier and other levels of government===
For many decades, the first ministers (&quot;Menteri Besar&quot;), chief ministers (&quot;Ketua Menteri&quot;) and premier (&quot;Premier&quot;) met with each other and the prime minister at &quot;Mesyuarat Menteri-Menteri Besar, Ketua-Ketua Menteri dan premier&quot;.

==Selection process==

===Eligibility===
By comparison, the thirteen state constitutions (&quot;Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri&quot; or &quot;Perlembagaan Negeri&quot;) have some similarities and also some differences in setting the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the Menteri Besar, chief minister and premier.

A &quot;Menteri Besar&quot; or &quot;Ketua Menteri&quot; or &quot;Premier&quot; must be a Malaysian citizen, of at least 21 years of age and a member of state legislative assembly who commands the confidence of the majority of the members of the assembly. Upon appointment, he shall not hold any office of profit and engage in any trade, business or profession that will cause conflict of interest.

For four states in Malaysia with governors (namely Penang, Malacca, Sabah and Sarawak), the office of &quot;Ketua Menteri&quot; and &quot;Premier&quot; are open to any Malaysian citizen regardless of their religion, ethnicity, and gender. However, citizens by naturalization or registration are still prohibited by state laws.

===Election===
The Menteri Besar, chief minister and premier are elected through a majority in the state legislative assembly. This is procedurally established by the vote of confidence in the legislative assembly, as suggested by the Ruler (or Governor) of the state who is the appointing authority.

===Oath===
Since, according to the constitution, the Menteri Besar is appointed by the ruler (or, in case of the chief minister and premier, the governor), the swearing-in is done before the ruler (or governor) of the state.

== Remuneration ==
Remuneration of the Menteri Besar, chief minister, premier as well as other members of the executive council (or Cabinet) and members of the state legislative assembly are to be decided by the respective state legislatures. Hence this varies from state to state according to their ordinance or enactment that amended by the state legislative.

<text>In molecular biology and genetics, transformation is the genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the direct uptake and incorporation of exogenous genetic material from its surroundings through the cell membrane(s). For transformation to take place, the recipient bacterium must be in a state of competence, which might occur in nature as a time-limited response to environmental conditions such as starvation and cell density, and may also be induced in a laboratory.

Transformation is one of three processes that lead to horizontal gene transfer, in which exogenous genetic material passes from one bacterium to another, the other two being conjugation (transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells in direct contact) and transduction (injection of foreign DNA by a bacteriophage virus into the host bacterium). In transformation, the genetic material passes through the intervening medium, and uptake is completely dependent on the recipient bacterium.

As of 2014 about 80 species of bacteria were known to be capable of transformation, about evenly divided between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; the number might be an overestimate since several of the reports are supported by single papers.

&quot;Transformation&quot; may also be used to describe the insertion of new genetic material into nonbacterial cells, including animal and plant cells; however, because &quot;transformation&quot; has a special meaning in relation to animal cells, indicating progression to a cancerous state, the process is usually called &quot;transfection&quot;.

==History==
Transformation in bacteria was first demonstrated in 1928 by the British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith. Griffith was interested in determining whether injections of heat-killed bacteria could be used to vaccinate mice against pneumonia. However, he discovered that a non-virulent strain of &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; could be made virulent after being exposed to heat-killed virulent strains. Griffith hypothesized that some &quot;transforming principle&quot; from the heat-killed strain was responsible for making the harmless strain virulent. In 1944 this &quot;transforming principle&quot; was identified as being genetic by Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty. They isolated DNA from a virulent strain of &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; and using just this DNA were able to make a harmless strain virulent. They called this uptake and incorporation of DNA by bacteria &quot;transformation&quot; (See Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment) The results of Avery et al.&#x27;s experiments were at first skeptically received by the scientific community and it was not until the development of genetic markers and the discovery of other methods of genetic transfer (conjugation in 1947 and transduction in 1953) by Joshua Lederberg that Avery&#x27;s experiments were accepted.

It was originally thought that &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, a commonly used laboratory organism, was refractory to transformation. However, in 1970, Morton Mandel and Akiko Higa showed that &quot;E. coli&quot; may be induced to take up DNA from bacteriophage λ without the use of helper phage after treatment with calcium chloride solution. Two years later in 1972, Stanley Norman Cohen, Annie Chang and Leslie Hsu showed that treatment is also effective for transformation of plasmid DNA. The method of transformation by Mandel and Higa was later improved upon by Douglas Hanahan. The discovery of artificially induced competence in &quot;E. coli&quot; created an efficient and convenient procedure for transforming bacteria which allows for simpler molecular cloning methods in biotechnology and research, and it is now a routinely used laboratory procedure.

Transformation using electroporation was developed in the late 1980s, increasing the efficiency of in-vitro transformation and increasing the number of bacterial strains that could be transformed. Transformation of animal and plant cells was also investigated with the first transgenic mouse being created by injecting a gene for a rat growth hormone into a mouse embryo in 1982. In 1897 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;, was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor-inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid. By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the tumor and adding in novel genes, researchers were able to infect plants with &quot;A. tumefaciens&quot; and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants. Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by &quot;A. tumefaciens&quot;, so other methods were developed, including electroporation and micro-injection. Particle bombardment was made possible with the invention of the Biolistic Particle Delivery System (gene gun) by John Sanford in the 1980s.

==Definitions==
Transformation is one of three forms of horizontal gene transfer that occur in nature among bacteria, in which DNA encoding for a trait passes from one bacterium to another and is integrated into the recipient genome by homologous recombination; the other two are transduction, carried out by means of a bacteriophage, and conjugation, in which a gene is passed through direct contact between bacteria. In transformation, the genetic material passes through the intervening medium, and uptake is completely dependent on the recipient bacterium.

Competence refers to a temporary state of being able to take up exogenous DNA from the environment; it may be induced in a laboratory.

It appears to be an ancient process inherited from a common prokaryotic ancestor that is a beneficial adaptation for promoting recombinational repair of DNA damage, especially damage acquired under stressful conditions. Natural genetic transformation appears to be an adaptation for repair of DNA damage that also generates genetic diversity.

Transformation has been studied in medically important Gram-negative bacteria species such as &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; and &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;. It has also been studied in Gram-negative species found in soil such as &quot;Pseudomonas stutzeri&quot;, &quot;Acinetobacter baylyi&quot;, and Gram-negative plant pathogens such as &quot;Ralstonia solanacearum&quot; and &quot;Xylella fastidiosa&quot;. Transformation among Gram-positive bacteria has been studied in medically important species such as &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus sanguinis&quot; and in Gram-positive soil bacterium &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;. It has also been reported in at least 30 species of &quot;Pseudomonadota&quot; distributed in several different classes. The best studied &quot;Pseudomonadota&quot; with respect to transformation are the medically important human pathogens &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, and &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;.

&quot;Transformation&quot; may also be used to describe the insertion of new genetic material into nonbacterial cells, including animal and plant cells; however, because &quot;transformation&quot; has a special meaning in relation to animal cells, indicating progression to a cancerous state, the process is usually called &quot;transfection&quot;.

==Natural competence and transformation ==
Naturally competent bacteria carry sets of genes that provide the protein machinery to bring DNA across the cell membrane(s). The transport of the exogenous DNA into the cells may require proteins that are involved in the assembly of type IV pili and type II secretion system, as well as DNA translocase complex at the cytoplasmic membrane.

Due to the differences in structure of the cell envelope between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, there are some differences in the mechanisms of DNA uptake in these cells, however most of them share common features that involve related proteins. The DNA first binds to the surface of the competent cells on a DNA receptor, and passes through the cytoplasmic membrane via DNA translocase. Only single-stranded DNA may pass through, the other strand being degraded by nucleases in the process. The translocated single-stranded DNA may then be integrated into the bacterial chromosomes by a RecA-dependent process. In Gram-negative cells, due to the presence of an extra membrane, the DNA requires the presence of a channel formed by secretins on the outer membrane. Pilin may be required for competence, but its role is uncertain. The uptake of DNA is generally non-sequence specific, although in some species the presence of specific DNA uptake sequences may facilitate efficient DNA uptake.

===Natural transformation===

Natural transformation is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer that depends on the expression of numerous bacterial genes whose products appear to be responsible for this process. In general, transformation is a complex, energy-requiring developmental process. In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must become competent, that is, enter a special physiological state. Competence development in &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; requires expression of about 40 genes. The DNA integrated into the host chromosome is usually (but with rare exceptions) derived from another bacterium of the same species, and is thus homologous to the resident chromosome.

In &quot;B. subtilis&quot; the length of the transferred DNA is greater than 1271 kb (more than 1 million bases). The length transferred is likely double stranded DNA and is often more than a third of the total chromosome length of 4215 kb. It appears that about 7-9% of the recipient cells take up an entire chromosome.

The capacity for natural transformation appears to occur in a number of prokaryotes, and thus far 67 prokaryotic species (in seven different phyla) are known to undergo this process.

Competence for transformation is typically induced by high cell density and/or nutritional limitation, conditions associated with the stationary phase of bacterial growth. Transformation in &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; occurs most efficiently at the end of exponential growth as bacterial growth approaches stationary phase. Transformation in &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;, as well as in many other streptococci, occurs at high cell density and is associated with biofilm formation. Competence in &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is induced toward the end of logarithmic growth, especially under conditions of amino acid limitation. Similarly, in &quot;Micrococcus luteus&quot; (a representative of the less well studied &quot;Actinomycetota&quot; phylum), competence develops during the mid-late exponential growth phase and is also triggered by amino acids starvation.

By releasing intact host and plasmid DNA, certain bacteriophages are thought to contribute to transformation.

===Transformation, as an adaptation for DNA repair===

Competence is specifically induced by DNA damaging conditions. For instance, transformation is induced in &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; by the DNA damaging agents mitomycin C (a DNA cross-linking agent) and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks). In &quot;B. subtilis&quot;, transformation is increased by UV light, a DNA damaging agent. In &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, ciprofloxacin, which interacts with DNA gyrase and introduces double-strand breaks, induces expression of competence genes, thus enhancing the frequency of transformation Using &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, Charpentier et al. tested 64 toxic molecules to determine which of these induce competence. Of these, only six, all DNA damaging agents, caused strong induction. These DNA damaging agents were mitomycin C (which causes DNA inter-strand crosslinks), norfloxacin, ofloxacin and nalidixic acid (inhibitors of DNA gyrase that cause double-strand breaks), bicyclomycin (causes single- and double-strand breaks), and hydroxyurea (induces DNA base oxidation). UV light also induced competence in &quot;L. pneumophila&quot;. Charpentier et al. suggested that competence for transformation probably evolved as a DNA damage response.
Logarithmically growing bacteria differ from stationary phase bacteria with respect to the number of genome copies present in the cell, and this has implications for the capability to carry out an important DNA repair process. During logarithmic growth, two or more copies of any particular region of the chromosome may be present in a bacterial cell, as cell division is not precisely matched with chromosome replication. The process of homologous recombinational repair (HRR) is a key DNA repair process that is especially effective for repairing double-strand damages, such as double-strand breaks. This process depends on a second homologous chromosome in addition to the damaged chromosome. During logarithmic growth, a DNA damage in one chromosome may be repaired by HRR using sequence information from the other homologous chromosome. Once cells approach stationary phase, however, they typically have just one copy of the chromosome, and HRR requires input of homologous template from outside the cell by transformation.
To test whether the adaptive function of transformation is repair of DNA damages, a series of experiments were carried out using &quot;B. subtilis&quot; irradiated by UV light as the damaging agent (reviewed by Michod et al. and Bernstein et al.) The results of these experiments indicated that transforming DNA acts to repair potentially lethal DNA damages introduced by UV light in the recipient DNA. The particular process responsible for repair was likely HRR. Transformation in bacteria can be viewed as a primitive sexual process, since it involves interaction of homologous DNA from two individuals to form recombinant DNA that is passed on to succeeding generations. Bacterial transformation in prokaryotes may have been the ancestral process that gave rise to meiotic sexual reproduction in eukaryotes (see Evolution of sexual reproduction; Meiosis.)

==Methods and mechanisms of transformation in laboratory ==
===Bacterial===
Artificial competence can be induced in laboratory procedures that involve making the cell passively permeable to DNA by exposing it to conditions that do not normally occur in nature. Typically the cells are incubated in a solution containing divalent cations (often calcium chloride) under cold conditions, before being exposed to a heat pulse (heat shock). Calcium chloride partially disrupts the cell membrane, which allows the recombinant DNA to enter the host cell. Cells that are able to take up the DNA are called competent cells.

It has been found that growth of Gram-negative bacteria in 20 mM Mg reduces the number of protein-to-lipopolysaccharide bonds by increasing the ratio of ionic to covalent bonds, which increases membrane fluidity, facilitating transformation. The role of lipopolysaccharides here are verified from the observation that shorter O-side chains are more effectively transformed – perhaps because of improved DNA accessibility.

The surface of bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot; is negatively charged due to phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides on its cell surface, and the DNA is also negatively charged. One function of the divalent cation therefore would be to shield the charges by coordinating the phosphate groups and other negative charges, thereby allowing a DNA molecule to adhere to the cell surface.

DNA entry into &quot;E. coli&quot; cells is through channels known as zones of adhesion or Bayer&#x27;s junction, with a typical cell carrying as many as 400 such zones. Their role was established when cobalamine (which also uses these channels) was found to competitively inhibit DNA uptake. Another type of channel implicated in DNA uptake consists of poly (HB):poly P:Ca. In this poly (HB) is envisioned to wrap around DNA (itself a polyphosphate), and is carried in a shield formed by Ca ions.

It is suggested that exposing the cells to divalent cations in cold condition may also change or weaken the cell surface structure, making it more permeable to DNA. The heat-pulse is thought to create a thermal imbalance across the cell membrane, which forces the DNA to enter the cells through either cell pores or the damaged cell wall.

Electroporation is another method of promoting competence. In this method the cells are briefly shocked with an electric field of 10-20 kV/cm, which is thought to create holes in the cell membrane through which the plasmid DNA may enter. After the electric shock, the holes are rapidly closed by the cell&#x27;s membrane-repair mechanisms.

===Yeast===
Most species of yeast, including &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, may be transformed by exogenous DNA in the environment. Several methods have been developed to facilitate this transformation at high frequency in the lab.
* Yeast cells may be treated with enzymes to degrade their cell walls, yielding spheroplasts. These cells are very fragile but take up foreign DNA at a high rate.
* Exposing intact yeast cells to alkali cations such as those of caesium or lithium allows the cells to take up plasmid DNA. Later protocols adapted this transformation method, using lithium acetate, polyethylene glycol, and single-stranded DNA. In these protocols, the single-stranded DNA preferentially binds to the yeast cell wall, preventing plasmid DNA from doing so and leaving it available for transformation.
* Electroporation: Formation of transient holes in the cell membranes using electric shock; this allows DNA to enter as described above for bacteria.
* Enzymatic digestion or agitation with glass beads may also be used to transform yeast cells.

Efficiency – Different yeast genera and species take up foreign DNA with different efficiencies. Also, most transformation protocols have been developed for baker&#x27;s yeast, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, and thus may not be optimal for other species. Even within one species, different strains have different transformation efficiencies, sometimes different by three orders of magnitude. For instance, when S. cerevisiae strains were transformed with 10 ug of plasmid YEp13, the strain DKD-5D-H yielded between 550 and 3115 colonies while strain OS1 yielded fewer than five colonies.

===Plants===

A number of methods are available to transfer DNA into plant cells. Some vector-mediated methods are:
*&quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-mediated transformation is the easiest and most simple plant transformation. Plant tissue (often leaves) are cut into small pieces, e.g. 10x10mm, and soaked for ten minutes in a fluid containing suspended &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;. The bacteria will attach to many of the plant cells exposed by the cut. The plant cells secrete wound-related phenolic compounds which in turn act to upregulate the virulence operon of the Agrobacterium. The virulence operon includes many genes that encode for proteins that are part of a Type IV secretion system that exports from the bacterium proteins and DNA (delineated by specific recognition motifs called border sequences and excised as a single strand from the virulence plasmid) into the plant cell through a structure called a pilus. The transferred DNA (called T-DNA) is piloted to the plant cell nucleus by nuclear localization signals present in the Agrobacterium protein VirD2, which is covalently attached to the end of the T-DNA at the Right border (RB). Exactly how the T-DNA is integrated into the host plant genomic DNA is an active area of plant biology research. Assuming that a selection marker (such as an antibiotic resistance gene) was included in the T-DNA, the transformed plant tissue can be cultured on selective media to produce shoots. The shoots are then transferred to a different medium to promote root formation. Once roots begin to grow from the transgenic shoot, the plants can be transferred to soil to complete a normal life cycle (make seeds). The seeds from this first plant (called the T1, for first transgenic generation) can be planted on a selective (containing an antibiotic), or if an herbicide resistance gene was used, could alternatively be planted in soil, then later treated with herbicide to kill wildtype segregants. Some plants species, such as &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; can be transformed by dipping the flowers or whole plant, into a suspension of &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;, typically strain C58 (C=Cherry, 58=1958, the year in which this particular strain of &quot;A. tumefaciens&quot; was isolated from a cherry tree in an orchard at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York). Though many plants remain recalcitrant to transformation by this method, research is ongoing that continues to add to the list the species that have been successfully modified in this manner.
*Viral transformation (transduction): Package the desired genetic material into a suitable plant virus and allow this modified virus to infect the plant. If the genetic material is DNA, it can recombine with the chromosomes to produce transformant cells. However, genomes of most plant viruses consist of single stranded RNA which replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cell. For such genomes this method is a form of transfection and not a real transformation, since the inserted genes never reach the nucleus of the cell and do not integrate into the host genome. The progeny of the infected plants is virus-free and also free of the inserted gene.

Some vector-less methods include:
*Gene gun: Also referred to as particle bombardment, microprojectile bombardment, or biolistics. Particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells or plant embryos. Some genetic material will stay in the cells and transform them. This method also allows transformation of plant plastids. The transformation efficiency is lower than in &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-mediated transformation, but most plants can be transformed with this method.
*Electroporation: Formation of transient holes in cell membranes using electric pulses of high field strength; this allows DNA to enter as described above for bacteria.

=== Fungi ===
There are some methods to produce transgenic fungi most of them being analogous to those used for plants. However, fungi have to be treated differently due to some of their microscopic and biochemical traits:

* A major issue is the dikaryotic state that parts of some fungi are in; dikaryotic cells contain two haploid nuclei, one of each parent fungus. If only one of these gets transformed, which is the rule, the percentage of transformed nuclei decreases after each sporulation.
* Fungal cell walls are quite thick hindering DNA uptake so (partial) removal is often required; complete degradation, which is sometimes necessary, yields protoplasts.
* Mycelial fungi consist of filamentous hyphae, which are, if at all, separated by internal cell walls interrupted by pores big enough to enable nutrients and organelles, sometimes even nuclei, to travel through each hypha. As a result, individual cells usually cannot be separated. This is problematic as neighbouring transformed cells may render untransformed ones immune to selection treatments, e.g. by delivering nutrients or proteins for antibiotic resistance.
* Additionally, growth (and thereby mitosis) of these fungi exclusively occurs at the tip of their hyphae which can also deliver issues.

As stated earlier, an array of methods used for plant transformation do also work in fungi:

* Agrobacterium is not only capable of infecting plants but also fungi, however, unlike plants, fungi do not secrete the phenolic compounds necessary to trigger Agrobacterium so that they have to be added, e.g. in the form of acetosyringone.
* Thanks to development of an expression system for small RNAs in fungi the introduction of a CRISPR/CAS9-system in fungal cells became possible. In 2016 the USDA declared that it will not regulate a white button mushroom strain edited with CRISPR/CAS9 to prevent fruit body browning causing a broad discussion about placing CRISPR/CAS9-edited crops on the market.
* Physical methods like electroporation, biolistics (&quot;gene gun&quot;), sonoporation that uses cavitation of gas bubbles produced by ultrasound to penetrate the cell membrane, etc. are also applicable to fungi.

===Animals===
Introduction of DNA into animal cells is usually called transfection, and is discussed in the corresponding article.

==Practical aspects of transformation in molecular biology==

The discovery of artificially induced competence in bacteria allow bacteria such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; to be used as a convenient host for the manipulation of DNA as well as expressing proteins. Typically plasmids are used for transformation in &quot;E. coli&quot;. In order to be stably maintained in the cell, a plasmid DNA molecule must contain an origin of replication, which allows it to be replicated in the cell independently of the replication of the cell&#x27;s own chromosome.

The efficiency with which a competent culture can take up exogenous DNA and express its genes is known as transformation efficiency and is measured in colony forming unit (cfu) per μg DNA used. A transformation efficiency of 1×108 cfu/μg for a small plasmid like pUC19 is roughly equivalent to 1 in 2000 molecules of the plasmid used being transformed.

In calcium chloride transformation, the cells are prepared by chilling cells in the presence of (in solution), making the cell become permeable to plasmid DNA. The cells are incubated on ice with the DNA, and then briefly heat-shocked (e.g., at 42 °C for 30–120 seconds). This method works very well for circular plasmid DNA. Non-commercial preparations should normally give 106 to 107 transformants per microgram of plasmid; a poor preparation will be about 104/μg or less, but a good preparation of competent cells can give up to ~108 colonies per microgram of plasmid. Protocols, however, exist for making supercompetent cells that may yield a transformation efficiency of over 109. The chemical method, however, usually does not work well for linear DNA, such as fragments of chromosomal DNA, probably because the cell&#x27;s native exonuclease enzymes rapidly degrade linear DNA. In contrast, cells that are naturally competent are usually transformed more efficiently with linear DNA than with plasmid DNA.
The transformation efficiency using the method decreases with plasmid size, and electroporation therefore may be a more effective method for the uptake of large plasmid DNA. Cells used in electroporation should be prepared first by washing in cold double-distilled water to remove charged particles that may create sparks during the electroporation process.

===Selection and screening in plasmid transformation===
Because transformation usually produces a mixture of relatively few transformed cells and an abundance of non-transformed cells, a method is necessary to select for the cells that have acquired the plasmid. The plasmid therefore requires a selectable marker such that those cells without the plasmid may be killed or have their growth arrested. Antibiotic resistance is the most commonly used marker for prokaryotes. The transforming plasmid contains a gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic that the bacteria are otherwise sensitive to. The mixture of treated cells is cultured on media that contain the antibiotic so that only transformed cells are able to grow. Another method of selection is the use of certain auxotrophic markers that can compensate for an inability to metabolise certain amino acids, nucleotides, or sugars. This method requires the use of suitably mutated strains that are deficient in the synthesis or utility of a particular biomolecule, and the transformed cells are cultured in a medium that allows only cells containing the plasmid to grow.

In a cloning experiment, a gene may be inserted into a plasmid used for transformation. However, in such experiment, not all the plasmids may contain a successfully inserted gene. Additional techniques may therefore be employed further to screen for transformed cells that contain plasmid with the insert. Reporter genes can be used as markers, such as the &quot;lacZ&quot; gene which codes for β-galactosidase used in blue-white screening. This method of screening relies on the principle of α-complementation, where a fragment of the &quot;lacZ&quot; gene (&quot;lacZα&quot;) in the plasmid can complement another mutant &quot;lacZ&quot; gene (&quot;lacZΔM15&quot;) in the cell. Both genes by themselves produce non-functional peptides, however, when expressed together, as when a plasmid containing &quot;lacZ-α&quot; is transformed into a &quot;lacZΔM15&quot; cells, they form a functional β-galactosidase. The presence of an active β-galactosidase may be detected when cells are grown in plates containing X-gal, forming characteristic blue colonies. However, the multiple cloning site, where a gene of interest may be ligated into the plasmid vector, is located within the &quot;lacZα&quot; gene. Successful ligation therefore disrupts the &quot;lacZα&quot; gene, and no functional β-galactosidase can form, resulting in white colonies. Cells containing successfully ligated insert can then be easily identified by its white coloration from the unsuccessful blue ones.

Other commonly used reporter genes are green fluorescent protein (GFP), which produces cells that glow green under blue light, and the enzyme luciferase, which catalyzes a reaction with luciferin to emit light. The recombinant DNA may also be detected using other methods such as nucleic acid hybridization with radioactive RNA probe, while cells that expressed the desired protein from the plasmid may also be detected using immunological methods.

<text>A floatplane is a type of seaplane with one or more slender floats mounted under the fuselage to provide buoyancy. By contrast, a flying boat uses its fuselage for buoyancy. Either type of seaplane may also have landing gear suitable for land, making the vehicle an amphibious aircraft. British usage is to call floatplanes &quot;seaplanes&quot; rather than use the term &quot;seaplane&quot; to refer to both floatplanes and flying boats.

==Use==

Since World War II and the advent of helicopters, advanced aircraft carriers and land-based aircraft, military seaplanes have stopped being used. This, coupled with the increased availability of civilian airstrips, has greatly reduced the number of flying boats being built. However, many modern civilian aircraft have floatplane variants, most offered as third-party modifications under a supplemental type certificate (STC), although there are several aircraft manufacturers that build floatplanes from scratch. These floatplanes have found their niche as one type of bush plane, for light duty transportation to lakes and other remote areas as well as to small/hilly islands without proper airstrips. They may operate on a charter basis (including pleasure flights), provide scheduled service, or be operated by residents of the area for private, personal use.
==Design==
Floatplanes have often been derived from land-based aircraft, with fixed floats mounted under the fuselage instead of an undercarriage (featuring wheels).
Floatplanes offer several advantages since the fuselage is not in contact with water, which simplifies production by not having to incorporate the compromises necessary for water tightness, general impact strength and the hydroplaning characteristics needed for the aircraft to leave the water. Attaching floats to a landplane also allows for much larger production volumes to pay for the development and production of the small number of aircraft operated from the water. Additionally, on all but the largest seaplanes, floatplane wings usually offer more clearance over obstacles, such as docks, reducing the difficulty in loading while on the water. A typical single engine flying boat is unable to bring the hull alongside a dock for loading while most floatplanes are able to do so.

Floats inevitably impose extra drag and weight, rendering floatplanes slower and less manoeuvrable during flight, with a slower rate of climb, than aircraft equipped with wheeled landing gear. Nevertheless, air races devoted to floatplanes attracted much attention during the 1920s and 1930s, most notably in the form of the Schneider Trophy, not least because water takeoffs permitted longer takeoff runs which allowed greater optimization for high speed compared to contemporary airfields.

There are two basic configurations for the floats on floatplanes: 
* &quot;single float&quot; designs, in which a single large float is mounted directly underneath the fuselage, with smaller stabilizing floats underneath the wingtips, on planes like the Nakajima A6M2-N
* &quot;twin float&quot; designs, with two main floats mounted side by side outboard of the fuselage. Some early twin float designs had additional wingtip stabilizing floats.

The main advantage of the single float design is its capability for landings in rough water: a long central float is directly attached to the fuselage, this being the strongest part of the aircraft structure, while the smaller floats under the outer wings provide the aircraft with lateral stability. By comparison, dual floats restrict handling, often to waves as little as one foot (0.3 metres) in height. However, twin float designs facilitate mooring and boarding, and – in the case of torpedo bombers – leave the belly free to carry a torpedo.

<text>A medical intuitive is an alternative medicine practitioner who claims to be able to use their intuitive abilities to find the cause of a physical or emotional condition through the use of insight rather than modern medicine. Other terms for such a person include medical clairvoyant or medical psychic.

==History==
The practice of claiming to use intuition or clairvoyance for medical information dates back to Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802–1866), whose intuitive healing practice began in 1854. Edgar Cayce (1877–1945) was known as one of the most well known medical clairvoyants. William M. Branham, the father of the Pentecostal Latter Rain Movement, was said by his followers to be able to discern the health condition of people that attended his services, and in many cases heal them of their affliction.

==Reception==
Making a formal medical diagnosis is not a practice for many medical intuitives. In a few cases medical intuitives have been hired by hospitals, clinics and medical offices, particularly in California. Many medical professionals and psychologists attribute perceived anecdotal successes by medical intuitives to a combination of wishful thinking, confirmation bias, the placebo effect, and regression fallacy associated with self-limiting conditions.

A few educational institutions offer graduate degrees that include &quot;research-based training&quot; and certifications for medical intuitives. Other medical intuitives may be licensed medical professionals and their ability to accurately diagnose diseases and heal may not be supported by scientific evidence.

In 2009 Steven Novella, writing on Science Based Medicine, calls medical intuitive diagnosis as &quot;purely magical thinking&quot; and refers to a &quot;Huffington Post&quot; article about it as &quot;a promotion of a dubious pseudoscientific medical claim&quot;.

<doc id="583446" wikidata="Q934271" url="?curid=583446" title="Black Sails in the Sunset">
<text>Black Sails in the Sunset is the fourth studio album by American rock band AFI. It was released on May 18, 1999, through Nitro Records. With the addition of guitarist Jade Puget as a permanent member, it is the first AFI album to feature the current line-up of the band.

==Background and music==
The band members, sans Jade Puget, were roommates when guitarist Mark Stopholese departed AFI. Puget had just graduated from college and was living in Davey Havok&#x27;s room while the band was on tour. They asked him to join the band as the new guitarist and immediately began writing the album; Puget had already written the basis for &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;. The band describes the album as forming the beginning of their subsequent sound, which contains more melodic vocals, as opposed to their first three albums, which maintain a fast, non-melodic punk sound. &quot;God Called in Sick Today&quot; marked the band&#x27;s first ballad-style song.

The album has been described stylistically as hardcore punk, horror punk, and post-hardcore.

==Artwork==
The band name and album title appears in the Caslon Antique font, in a semi-reflective silver on the outside cover. The band commissioned illustrator Alan Forbes to depict skulls emerging from the water on the cover. Bassist Hunter Burgan later shared a concept design from Forbes, which prominently depicts a literal skeleton and other faces and bones.

The album cover illustration features an uneasy black-and-blue ocean below an orange sky and dark clouds. A black-sailed ship on the horizon sails to the far right.

The back cover shows the same horizon but crops out the ship, which appears in white on the CD label and behind the CD tray. The inner edge of the CD case reveals the message &quot;Beyond and To All Time I Stand&quot;, a lyric from the hidden track, &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;. The liner notes feature an illustration of a ship in a storm, as well as photos of the band and a more decorative band logo.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot; was received well by critics. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, commenting that &quot;with new guitarist Jade Puget adding a sense of brooding, thespian eloquence to the disc&#x27;s shadowy post-hardcore, AFI all but reinvented themselves,&quot; and &quot;With longer, deeper, richer, more complex compositions than they&#x27;ve ever attempted before, Black Sails tackles everything from brooding hardcore ... to shimmering balladry...&quot; The publication also went as far as to say that the album is &quot;their first epic.&quot;

&quot;Decoy Music&quot; praised Havok&#x27;s lyrical contribution to the album, commending his efforts to &quot;find himself,&quot; saying &quot;the way he expresses how he feels is pure poetry.&quot; Yarborough concluded by recommending the album to &quot;anyone who likes heavy punk.&quot;

In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

==Track listing==

* An unnamed track, sometimes called &quot;The Chicken Song&quot;, is featured as a hidden track on the &quot;No Time to Kill&quot; compilation. The CD-Text for the CD release of &quot;No Time to Kill&quot; assigns it the title &quot;Bawk Bawk Chewy&quot;.

<doc id="583450" wikidata="Q191284" url="?curid=583450" title="Centre Against Expulsions">
<text>The Centre Against Expulsions (, ZgV) was a planned German documentation centre for s and ethnic cleansing, particularly the expulsion of Germans after World War II. There were three different phases of expulsion: the fleeing of an oncoming Red Army, &#x27;wild expulsions&#x27; before the end of the war, and those sancitoned as a result of the Potsdam Treaty.&#x27;

Since March 19, 2008 the name of the project is Sichtbares Zeichen gegen Flucht und Vertreibung. 

The project was initiated by the Federation of Expellees, who dedicated a &quot;Foundation Centre Against Expulsions&quot; to the centre. This foundation is based in Wiesbaden, and headed by CDU politician and president of the Federation of Expellees, Erika Steinbach. The other head of the foundation was SPD politician Peter Glotz who died in 2005. The head of the foundation ZgV since 2018 is Christean Wagner, a politician of the Christian Democratic Union in Germany.

Since late 2008, the project is forwarded by the Federal Republic of Germany, when the federal government and parliament passed a law calling for the constitution of a &quot;Foundation German Historical Museum&quot; subordinate to the federal government, which in turn shall hold a &quot;Foundation Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation&quot; which shall take on the actual documentation in Berlin. The project has been subject to criticism, especially in Poland.

==&quot;Foundation Centre Against Expulsions&quot; of the Federation of Expellees==

The Federation of Expellees ( is the German non-governmental head organization of various organized groups of German refugees and expellees. The federation is committed to document the post- World War II flight and expulsion of Germans as well as other forced displacements, and maintains an exhibition for this purpose shown in changing locations of Germany. To expand this exhibition and to find a permanent place for it, the Federation of Expellees set up the &quot;Foundation Centre Against Expulsions&quot; () on 6 September 2000.

=== Objectives ===

The foundation Centre Against Expulsions defines four objectives:

# To document the history of settlement, culture, post-World War II deportation and expulsion, forced labour, torture, and later emigration of Germans from various countries of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, in a modern museum. The museum shall provide room for the documentation and &quot;additional space for sadness, sympathy and forgiveness&quot; in a requiem rotunda.
# To document and to evaluate the impact of the integration of millions of uprooted Germans into the post-World War II German society.
# To document the &quot;expulsion and genocide of other peoples, especially in Europe&quot;, arguing that &quot;displacement, expulsion and genocide can never be justified, [...] are always a crime, contradicting human rights and carried out by following the archaic thinking of the bloody vendetta.&quot;
# To donate a &quot;Franz Werfel Human Rights Award&quot; to people who &quot;sharpen the sense of responsibility through their actions is one of the foundation&#x27;s tasks&quot;.

==&quot;Foundation Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation&quot;==

On 11 November 2005, the largest German political parties SPD and CDU signed a coalition. One stated goal of the coalition is the establishment of a centre termed &quot;Visible Sign&quot; ().

On 3 September 2008 the German federal government passed a law calling for the establishment of a center against expulsions in the &quot;Deutschlandhaus&quot; building of the Anhalter Bahnhof site in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The law passed the German parliament and was enacted on 29 December 2008. The center is to be run by a &quot;Foundation Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation&quot; () subordinate to the governmental &quot;Foundation German Historical Museum&quot; ().

===&quot;Foundation German Historical Museum&quot; of the German federal government===

The purpose of this foundation is stated in §16 of the above-mentioned law as follows:

(1) The purpose of the non-autonomous foundation is to ensure in the spirit of reconciliation the remembrance of flight and expulsion in the 20th century in the historical context of the Second World War and the Nazi expansion and extermination policy and their aftermaths.

(2) This purpose shall be fulfilled especially by the following measures:
*(2.1) Establishment, maintenance and expansion of a permanent exhibition documenting flight and expulsion in the 20th century, the historical background and contexts as well as the European dimension and effects.
*(2.2) Development of singular exhibitions for special aspects of the overall context.
*(2.3) Distribution of research results and scientific findings.
*(2.4) Gathering, documentation and scientific evaluation of respective sources and materials, also and especially eyewitness accounts.
*(2.5) Cooperation with German and international museums and research centers.

== People and supporters ==

The scientific advisory board includes or included Jörg Baberowski, Arnulf Baring, Peter Becher, Lothar Gall, Bernhard Graf, Helga Hirsch, Walter Homolka, Eckart Klein, Hilmar Kopper, Rudolf Kucera, Otto Graf Lambsdorff, Horst Möller, Christoph Pan, Rüdiger Safranski, Christoph Stölzl, Christian Tomuschat, Krisztián Ungváry, Georg Wildmann, Michael Wolffsohn, Alfred-Maurice de Zayas and Zoran Ziletic.

The United Nations&#x27; first High Commissioner for Human Rights Dr. José Ayala Lasso, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Nobel literature laureate and Holocaust survivor Imre Kertész, Joachim Gauck, Milan Horáček, former Austrian crown prince Otto von Habsburg, and historians such as Guido Knopp, Hungarian novelist György Konrád, and Christian Tomuschat, have also voiced their support for the centre.

==Criticism==

In a petition initiated by Hans Henning Hahn, Eva Hahn, Alexandra Kurth, Samuel Salzborn and Tobias Weger in 2003, signed by several hundred people, primarily German, Czech, and Polish historians, opponents of the proposed form of Centre expressed concerns the centre would &quot;establish and popularize a one-sided image of the past, without historical context&quot;, and see the dangers of &quot;de-contexualizing the past&quot; and &quot;ethnification of social conflicts&quot;. German-Jewish writer Ralph Giordano withdrew his initial support for the same reason, but defended Steinbach against the latest personal accusations from Poland, which he called defamation. Former German Foreign minister Joschka Fischer said &quot;This can&#x27;t be a museum of German war victims. Germans can&#x27;t point fingers at others&quot;.

===Criticism in Poland===

Critics in Poland oppose the idea of the centre claiming that it would equate German suffering with that of the Jews and Poles and will suggest a moral equivalence between the victims of war and their oppressors. Marek Edelman, the last living leader of Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, criticized the project as nationalistic, arrogant and serving to realize political ambitions of the backers of the project. According to Edelman other nations subject to German expulsions didn&#x27;t establish any comparable monuments, even as they faced a harsher fate than Germans.

The Polish government opposes the involvement of Erika Steinbach in any issues related to Polish-German history and at the same time supports an international net of centers dedicated to remembrance of totalitarian regimes and their victims called &quot;European Network Remembrance and Solidarity&quot;.

He was LNP Leader from 2 April 2011 to 7 February 2015; Newman previously served as the 15th Lord Mayor of Brisbane from 27 March 2004 to 3 April 2011.

Newman was elected to the lord mayorship as a member of the Liberal Party. He became a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP) following the July 2008 merger of the Queensland Liberals and the Nationals. In March 2011, Newman announced that he would challenge opposition leader John-Paul Langbroek for the leadership of the LNP. Langbroek resigned, and Newman was elected his successor. As Newman was not a member of the Legislative Assembly, former state Nationals leader Jeff Seeney was elected interim opposition leader while Newman headed the party&#x27;s election team from outside the legislature.

Newman led the LNP in the 2012 state election, winning 78 of 89 seats from a 44-seat two-party swing, a record for Queensland. At the same time, he was elected to the seat of Ashgrove in western Brisbane. He was sworn in as premier two days later, becoming the first Brisbane-based non-Labor premier in 97 years. At the 2015 state election, the Newman-led LNP suffered a 14.0-point two-party swing, resulting in a hung parliament—of 89 seats, Labor won 44 seats and the statewide two-party vote while the LNP were reduced to 42 seats. Newman himself lost his own seat to his Labor predecessor, Kate Jones. On 10 February 2015, Newman submitted his resignation and he was replaced as premier by Annastacia Palaszczuk four days later as Labor formed a minority government.

In July 2021, Newman resigned from the LNP, and in August 2021 announced he had joined the Liberal Democrats and would be standing as the party&#x27;s lead Senate candidate in Queensland at the 2022 Australian federal election. Newman was the first premier of Queensland from the Liberal National Party.

==Early life and military career==
Campbell Newman was born on 12 August 1963 in Canberra, to parents who later both represented Tasmania in the federal parliament and were both ministers in Liberal–National coalition governments. His father, Kevin, represented the federal seat of Bass from 1975 to 1984, and was a minister in the Fraser government. His mother, Jocelyn Newman (née Mullett), was a Senator for Tasmania (1986–2002) and a minister in the Howard government. Campbell Newman was raised in Tasmania, attending Launceston Church Grammar School, then returned to Canberra.

He joined the Australian Army as a staff cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1981, graduating as a lieutenant in 1985. He spent 13 years in the army, resigning in 1993 with the rank of major. He has an honours degree in civil engineering from the University of New South Wales.

He moved to Queensland, where he graduated with an MBA from the University of Queensland, then worked as a consultant for PA Consulting Group, and subsequently for the agricultural storage company Grainco, before deciding to stand for election as lord mayor of Brisbane.

==Lord Mayor of Brisbane==

In the 2004 election, Newman narrowly defeated Labor incumbent Tim Quinn. However, a majority of wards returned Labor councillors, meaning Newman had to work with a Labor-dominated civic cabinet and a Labor deputy mayor.

The most significant infrastructure item initiated or delivered during this first term was the TransApex package of bridge, traffic and tunnel projects.

In the 2008 election, Newman was re-elected and the Liberals took control of the council by taking five wards from Labor.

Newman was selected as one of 25 mayors from across the world shortlisted for the 2010 World Mayor Prize, an online competition aimed at raising the profile of civic leaders. When the results were announced, Newman was declared the fifth-best mayor in the world.

==State-level politics==

===Election to parliament===
On 18 March 2011, &quot;Nine News Queensland&quot; Spencer Jolly reported that the LNP&#x27;s organisational wing was engineering a plan to make Newman the leader of the LNP. According to Jolly, party president Bruce McIver was trying to arrange for Bruce Flegg, the former leader of the Queensland Liberals and the MP for Moggill, the only safe LNP seat in Brisbane at the time, to resign and hand his seat to Newman. Under this plan, once Newman was safely in the legislature, he would have challenged Opposition Leader John-Paul Langbroek—who, like Newman, is from the Liberal side of the LNP merger—for the leadership of the LNP. Newman subsequently acknowledged he had been approached about moving up to state politics. Although he did not rule out running in the next state election he stated that, for the time being, he was committed to serving out his term as lord mayor and running for re-election in 2012.

However, on 22 March, Newman announced that he was seeking the LNP preselection for the west Brisbane seat of Ashgrove, held by Labor&#x27;s Kate Jones, in the election due for 2012. If he won preselection, Newman said, he would then make a bid for the LNP leadership. According to ABC News, the LNP&#x27;s organisational wing wanted Newman to run for a state seat and the leadership when polls showed he was the only non-Labor politician who matched Premier Anna Bligh&#x27;s popularity during the 2010–11 Queensland floods.

Jones held Ashgrove with a margin of 7.1 points, making it a &quot;fairly safe&quot; Labor seat, on paper. However, according to Australian Broadcasting Corporation elections analyst Antony Green, Newman carried The Gap ward, which contains the bulk of Ashgrove (Brisbane City Council wards are almost as large as state electorates), with 56 per cent of the two-party vote in 2004 and almost 70 per cent in 2008. According to Green, if Newman repeated his past performance in The Gap, he would be able to take Ashgrove off Labor.

Within hours of Newman&#x27;s announcement, Langbroek and deputy leader Lawrence Springborg both resigned their posts. Langbroek had been under growing pressure from the LNP&#x27;s organisational wing to stand down after Labor&#x27;s polling numbers rebounded in the wake of the floods. However, as late as a day before Newman&#x27;s announcement, Langbroek insisted he would not do so. On 2 April 2011, Newman was elected as the leader of the LNP. The next day he won the LNP preselection for Ashgrove, unopposed.

Normal practice in a Westminster system would have called for an LNP member of parliament from a safe seat to resign so that Newman could enter parliament via a by-election. However, it became apparent that a by-election could not be arranged. To solve this problem, former state Nationals leader Jeff Seeney, who had been elected deputy leader of the LNP, was named as the party&#x27;s interim parliamentary leader—and hence Leader of the Opposition—while Newman led the LNP election team from outside the legislature. Seeney agreed to cede the post of parliamentary leader to Newman should Newman win election to the legislature. Newman&#x27;s ascent to the role of leader outside of Parliament led Bligh to briefly consider breaking her previous vow to let the legislature run full-term. She had promised to focus exclusively on recovery in 2011, but was concerned that the LNP&#x27;s leadership situation could make the co-operation necessary for the recovery effort impossible. Bligh also accused Newman of &quot;abandoning&quot; the lord mayor&#x27;s post, saying that Newman should not have &quot;cut and run&quot; while the recovery effort was still underway.

The first Newspoll taken after Newman assumed the leadership showed that the LNP had regained the lead in opinion polling; it had led most polls from July until the floods. Newman had also consistently led Bligh as preferred premier.

Soon after Newman became leader of the LNP, Labor state treasurer Andrew Fraser used parliamentary privilege to claim he had received information from within the LNP that Flegg had been given an inducement to resign and allow Newman to run for his seat in a by-election. On 18 July 2011, the Crime and Misconduct Commission announced that the investigation found no evidence to support Fraser&#x27;s allegations and all parties were cleared.
Billionaire and LNP benefactor Clive Palmer said the &quot;CMC [was] colluding with the government&quot; while the LNP accused Fraser of &quot;knowing too much about the investigation&quot;.

Newman made it clear that when he took over the LNP leadership, all policies previously announced would be scrapped and essentially become &quot;null and void&quot; with new policy announcements to be made. In an attempt to win voter support in regional Queensland, Newman&#x27;s first official LNP policy announcement was that he would not support daylight saving in Queensland or South East Queensland, even though as Brisbane&#x27;s Lord Mayor he had been a vocal advocate for daylight saving.

Newman stated his support for same-sex marriage. The LNP, however, stated prior to the 2012 election that if they win government they may move to repeal such laws.

On 30 May 2021, Newman was made one of the LNP&#x27;s trustees, a party elder position that is involved in finances and has a seat on the state executive. It is understood that the acting LNP President, Cynthia Hardy, approached Newman about the role, to which he was then elected in a vote of state executive.

===Election victory===
On 25 January 2012, Bligh announced that a state election would be held in Queensland on 24 March, but that she would not formally ask the Governor to dissolve parliament until 19 February. For Newman to unseat Bligh as premier, he needed not only to win Ashgrove, but also lead the LNP to at least an 11-seat gain. However, the LNP were unbackable favourites to win the election; as mentioned above they had been leading in opinion polling for all but a few months since July 2011.

On 15 March 2012, Bligh referred to the Crime and Misconduct Commission material concerning an office in a building owned by interests associated with Newman&#x27;s family. Despite allegations of inappropriate dealings for personal benefit, a week before the election the CMC finalised its assessment that there was no evidence of official misconduct by Newman while he was Lord Mayor of Brisbane. Consequently, no further investigation was warranted nor would be conducted by the CMC concerning Newman.

In the election, Newman led the LNP to a comprehensive victory. The LNP won 78 seats against only seven for Labor, taking 44 seats on a swing of 14.5 points. That was largely because Brisbane, Labor&#x27;s power base for more than 20 years, swung over dramatically to support Newman. The LNP won an unprecedented 37 seats in Brisbane, in many cases on swings of 10 points or more. By comparison, it had gone into the election holding only six of the capital&#x27;s 40 seats; Labor had held power mostly on the strength of winning at least 30 seats there in every election since 1989. It was easily the worst defeat a sitting government has ever suffered in Queensland, and one of the most lopsided election results ever recorded at the state level in Australia. Newman himself won a convincing victory in Ashgrove, taking 51 per cent of the primary vote and 54 per cent of the two-party vote on a swing of 13.8 points—almost double the swing needed.

Newman formally claimed victory at 8:45 pm Queensland time, saying he had received a mandate to make Queensland &quot;a can-do place once more.&quot; The LNP had run on the slogan &quot;Can Do Queensland&quot; (stylised as &quot;CanDoQLD&quot;)—derived from his mayoral campaign slogan, &quot;Can Do Campbell&quot;.

==Premier==

===Newman government===

Normal practice in Australia calls for a defeated government to stay in office on a caretaker basis until the final results are in. However, the day after the election, with the LNP&#x27;s victory beyond doubt even though counting was still under way in several seats, Bligh announced she was resigning as premier and retiring from politics. An hour later, Newman announced that he intended to advise Governor Penny Wensley that he was able to form a government. He also announced that he intended to have himself and his top two shadow ministers, Seeney and Tim Nicholls, sworn in as an interim three-man government until a full ministry could be named, with Seeney as deputy premier and Nicholls as treasurer. Newman was formally sworn in as Queensland&#x27;s 38th premier on 26 March. His interim government remained in office until the full ministry was sworn in a week later. Upon swearing-in, he became the first non-Labor premier from the Brisbane area, as well as the first non-interim premier aligned federally with the Liberals (or their predecessors) since Digby Denham left office in 1915. The last Liberal premier of Queensland, Gordon Chalk, served as a caretaker between the death of Jack Pizzey in 1968 and the election of Joh Bjelke-Petersen later that year. He is also the first person since Federation to lead a party to victory while not himself serving in the legislature at the time of the election. Newman entered office with the largest majority government in Queensland history, and percentage-wise the largest legislative majority in any Australian state or federal election in history at the time. He announced that he would focus on rebuilding Queensland&#x27;s economy and setting its finances in order. He also asked his large party room to put together plans to &quot;deliver their promises&quot; in their own seats.

On 29 March, Newman announced his support for newly elected Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk&#x27;s proposal to extend the parliamentary term in Queensland to four years, as is the case in the other states. He also promised that Labor would have the full rights and privileges entitled to the Official Opposition, even though at the time it was two seats short of official status in the legislature (Labor subsequently took two seats off the LNP in by-elections). In January 2013, Newman announced plans to push for Queensland to allow optional preferential voting in federal elections.

===Privatisation===
Newman&#x27;s government supported privatisation and the sale of state assets, but never sold any state assets.

===Law and order===
In September 2013, Newman announced that bootcamps for convicted young people will open in Townsville and Rockhampton by September 2013, along with two other camps. These bootcamps closed in 2015 under the Labor government.

In October 2013 the Newman government passed new legislation which handed discretionary powers to the state Attorney-General to indefinitely extend the detention of sex offenders. The legislation was criticised by the Law Society of Queensland, the Bar Association of Queensland, the Australian Council for Civil Liberties and retired judges. Newman responded by describing opponents of the law as &quot;apologists for sex offenders and paedophiles&quot;. In addition to targeting sex offenders, other legislation aims to imprison members and associates of &quot;outlaw motorcycle clubs&quot;, naming 26 clubs. The bill attracted a large amount of criticism from law professionals and Amnesty International. In particular, the bill was criticised by Amnesty International for sweeping so broadly that innocent conduct may be caught and infringing the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, although Newman claimed that Queenslanders wanted the tough new laws.

By September 2013, Newman&#x27;s government had cut 12,282 public service jobs in Queensland.

On 7 April 2014, the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption heard that Newman wanted $5,000 to meet Sydney businessman Nick Di Girolamo when he was the Lord Mayor of Brisbane.

On 21 July 2014, Newman was forced to withdraw a very small part of the controversial biker laws following a landslide defeat in a by-election in the seat of Stafford (itself following a huge swing and loss for the government in a by-election in the seat of Redcliffe) and rapidly decaying public approval across the state. The government also promised to reinstate bipartisan support and the previous parliamentary estimates.

=== 2015 election ===

On 5 January 2015, media organisations reported that Newman intended to announce the election date the next day. On 6 January, Newman confirmed on Twitter that he had visited acting governor Tim Carmody and writs had been issued for an election on 31 January. During the election campaign there was speculation that Newman, sitting on a two-party margin of 5.7 points in his seat of Ashgrove, was at risk of losing his own seat, drawing into question his ability to remain as Premier even if the LNP won another term.

At the election Newman lost Ashgrove to his Labor predecessor, Kate Jones, on a swing of nearly 10 points. With his defeat in Ashgrove beyond doubt even though counting had not been finalised, Newman announced his retirement from politics on election night. He immediately resigned as both premier and LNP leader, though he remained as caretaker premier for nearly two weeks while the overall result was in doubt. Newman was the second sitting Queensland premier to lose his own seat, the first being Digby Denham. Ultimately, in a shock result, Labor came up just one seat short of the 36-seat swing it needed to win back government in its own right, and was able to form a minority government with the support of independent Peter Wellington.

Newman&#x27;s defeat triggered an unsuccessful party room challenge to then Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles, whose leadership style was reported to be similar to Newman&#x27;s.

Newman is the only person to have served the entirety of his time in the Queensland Parliament as Premier.

==Attempted move to federal politics==
A week after his 2015 state election defeat it was revealed that Newman, while still caretaker premier, was approached to stand for Liberal preselection for the federal seat of Indi in Victoria. It was reported that Newman&#x27;s army background may possibly sit well with the 10 per cent of Australia&#x27;s army that is stationed in the electorate. However, Newman declined to run for the Indi preselection.

===2021 resignation from the LNP===
Newman announced his resignation from the LNP on 25 July 2021 along with his wife, saying the LNP candidate in the 2021 Stretton state by-election was &quot;let down by a party and leadership that never stands up for anything&quot;. Newman hinted at plans to return to politics at a federal level and was yet to decide whether to run in a party or as an independent but said if he did run, it would be for the Australian Senate.

===Joining the Liberal Democrats===
On 8 August 2021, Newman announced his candidacy for the federal Senate representing Queensland at the 2022 federal election with the Liberal Democrats. Newman criticised the major parties for the use of &quot;heavy-handed&quot; measures he says are responsible for &quot;the destruction of people&#x27;s livelihoods, jobs and freedoms&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic. Newman was not elected to the Senate.

==Political views==
Newman describes himself as a libertarian.

Newman supports same-sex marriage.

==Personal life and family==
Newman lives in Brisbane with his wife Lisa. They have two daughters. In February 2020, in an online interview, Campbell Newman described his political philosophy as being libertarian. Campbell and Lisa Newman announced their resignations from the LNP on 25 July 2021.

<text>Caroline Myss (pronounced &quot;mace&quot;; born December 2, 1952) is an American author of 10 books and many audio recordings about mysticism and wellness. She is most well known for publishing &quot;Anatomy of the Spirit&quot; (1996). She also co-published The Creation of Health with Dr C Norman Shealy, MD, former Harvard professor of neurology. Myss describes herself as a medical intuitive and a mystic. 

She was on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; several times including her 2002 appearance. In 2001 she hosted a TV series titled &quot;The Journey With Caroline Myss&quot; on the Oxygen (TV network), co-owned by Oprah Winfrey, exploring the spiritual and psychological roadblocks of life in an intimate workshop setting. 

Her work has been criticized by some as being unsubstantiated and pseudoscientific. However, other sources suggest that energy medicine can have a place in an integrative approach to health, and while some are skeptical that &quot;our biography becomes our biology&quot;, the concept may have a scientific basis.

==Biography==
Caroline Myss was born on December 2, 1952, in Chicago and grew up with her parents and two brothers, one elder and one younger, in the Melrose Park, Illinois neighborhood near Chicago. She was raised a Catholic in a large Polish American family, and attended the Mother Guerin High School, River Grove, Illinois, run by the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. She completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism from the Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College in Indiana in 1974, and started her career in journalism in Chicago.

During the course of her career, she interviewed Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the author of the famous book &quot;On Death and Dying&quot;, which inspired her to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in theology from Mundelein College, Chicago, which she completed in 1979. In 2008, she wrote the foreword to Kübler-Ross&#x27;s revised version of &quot;On Life After Death&quot;.

She started giving medical intuitive readings in 1982 and co-founded a small New Age publishing company, Stillpoint Publishing in Walpole, New Hampshire, where she also worked as an editor in 1983. Next she began consulting with holistic doctors, which in 1984, led to her extensive collaboration with C. Norman Shealy, physician and founder of the American Holistic Medical Association, with whom she later co-authored &quot;AIDS: Passageway to Transformation&quot;, in 1987, followed by &quot;The Creation of Health: The Emotional, Psychological, and Spiritual Responses that Promote Health and Healing&quot;, in 1988. Deriving from her practice as a medical intuitive, she started writing books, in the field of energy medicine, and healing, five of which became New York Times Best Sellers. Myss wrote &quot;Anatomy of the Spirit: The Seven Stages of Power and Healing&quot; (1996), which was followed by &quot;Why People Don&#x27;t Heal and How They Can&quot; (1998), which explored the reasons people do not heal through her concept of &quot;woundology.&quot; Her next book, &quot;Sacred Contracts: Awakening Your Divine Potential&quot; (2002) dealt with the issue of finding one&#x27;s life purpose, describing sacred contracts as a set of assignments to help one identify their particular spiritual archetypes. She has since appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; numerous times.

By 2000, she discontinued doing private medical intuitive readings, and began teaching how to do them through her workshops, seminars, radio shows and guided tours. She tours internationally as a speaker on spirituality and mysticism, and lives in Oak Park, Illinois, near Chicago. In 2003, she founded the Caroline Myss Educational Institute (CMED) in Chicago, Illinois, with business partner David Smith, offering weekend workshops on her books and teachings.

Her 2007 book, &quot;Entering the Castle&quot; draws upon the writings of Saint Teresa of Ávila, a 16th-century Carmelite nun, who wrote her most important work, &quot;The Interior Castle&quot; (1577), towards the end of her life. Her next book, &quot;Defy Gravity, Healing Beyond the Bounds of Reason&quot; (2009) took the ideas further with mystical laws, the seven shadows and also seven graces inherent in all of us.

Myss started hosting a weekly Call-in Talk radio show, &quot;Sacred Contracts&quot; around 2005, at Hay House Radio, an Internet radio site, run by Hay House publishing, where she gave online intuitive readings to callers. Then in 2009, the show was renamed &quot;Defy Gravity&quot; after her book by the same name was released in October 2009.

In June 2012, Myss appeared on a &quot;Super Soul Sunday&quot; episode with Oprah Winfrey, on OWN Network.

==Criticism==
In Michael Shermer&#x27;s book &quot;The Skeptic: Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience&quot;, Phil Molé says &quot;Caroline Myss offers no tangible evidence to support any of her claims. Her hypothetical energy system cannot be detected, her intuitive diagnostic abilities are unproven, and her holistic philosophy is riddled with inconsistencies and unsubstantiated judgments.&quot;

Joe Nickell, a skeptic and paranormal investigator, says, &quot;Myss provides no proof of her alleged abilities. She intuits, of course, her intuitive power, offers only hearsay testimonials and anecdotal evidence as support.&quot; He has also described Myss as having &quot;many of the traits associated with a fantasy prone personality.&quot;

<doc id="583459" wikidata="Q1581794" url="?curid=583459" title="Million Man March">
<text>The Million Man March was a large gathering of African-American men in Washington, D.C., on October 16, 1995. Called by Louis Farrakhan, it was held on and around the National Mall. The National African American Leadership Summit, a leading group of civil rights activists and the Nation of Islam working with scores of civil rights organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP, involving its local chapters, not headquarters) formed the Million Man March Organizing Committee. The founder of the National African American Leadership Summit, Benjamin Chavis Jr., served as National Director of the Million Man March.

The committee invited many prominent speakers to address the audience, and African-American men from across the United States converged in Washington to &quot;convey to the world a vastly different picture of the Black male&quot; and to unite in self-help and self-defense against economic and social ills plaguing the African-American community.

The march took place in the context of a larger grassroots movement that set out to win politicians&#x27; attention for urban and minority issues through widespread voter registration campaigns. On the same day, there was a parallel event called the &quot;Day of Absence&quot;, organized by women in conjunction with the March leadership, which was intended to engage the large population of Black Americans who would not be able to attend the demonstration in Washington. On this date, all Blacks were encouraged to stay home from their usual school, work, and social engagements, in favor of attending teach-ins, and worship services, focusing on the struggle for a healthy and self-sufficient Black community. Further, organizers of the Day of Absence hoped to use the occasion to make great headway on their voter registration drive.

A conflict arose about crowd size estimates between March organizers and National Park Service officials. The National Park Service issued an estimate of about 400,000 attendees, a number significantly lower than march organizers had hoped for. After a heated exchange between leaders of the march and the NPS, ABC-TV-funded researchers at Boston University estimated the crowd size to be about 837,000 members, with a 20% margin of error.

Two years after the march, the Million Woman March was held in response to concerns that the Million Man March had focused on Black men to the exclusion of Black women.

==Economic and social factors==

One of the primary motivating factors for the march was to place black issues back on the nation&#x27;s political agenda. In the aftermath of the Republican Party&#x27;s victory in the 1994 Congressional election and the continued success of the party&#x27;s campaign platform, the Contract with America, some African-American leaders believed that the social and economic issues facing the black community fell by the wayside of policy debates. March organizers believed that politicians were failing the black community by &quot;papering over the most vital dimensions of the crisis in international capitalism&quot; and blaming urban blacks for &quot;domestic economic woes that threatened to produce record deficits, massive unemployment, and uncontrolled inflation&quot;.

At the time of the march, African Americans faced unemployment rates nearly twice that of white Americans, a poverty rate of more than 40%, and a median family income that was about 58% of the median for white households. More than 11% of all black men were unemployed and for those aged 16 to 19, the number of unemployed had climbed to over 50%. Further, according to Reverend Jesse Jackson&#x27;s speech at the March, the United States House of Representatives had reduced funding to some of the programs that played an integral role in urban Americans&#x27; lives. He said, &quot;The House of Representatives cut $1.1 billion from the nation&#x27;s poorest public schools&quot;, and &quot;cut $137 million from Head Start&quot;, effectively subtracting $5,000 from each classroom&#x27;s budget and cutting 45,000 preschoolers from a crucial early education program.

Environmental hazards were also seen as making the lives of urban Blacks unstable. Black men were murdered at a rate of 72 per 100,000, a rate significantly higher than the 9.3 per 100,000 attributed to white men. Some black activists blamed aggressive law enforcement and prison construction for leaving &quot;two hundred thousand more blacks in the jail complex than in college&quot; and creating devastating leadership gaps within black communities and families. Event organizers were infuriated by a perceived gap in prenatal care for black women and children that was caused, in part, by the closing of inner-city hospitals.

Event organizers believed that urban Blacks were born with &quot;three strikes against them&quot;: insufficient prenatal care, inferior educational opportunities, and jobless parents. Instead of providing young children with the means to succeed, they believed the government instead intervened in the lives of its black citizens through law enforcement and welfare programs that did little to improve the community&#x27;s circumstances.

==Media portrayal==

In addition to their goal of fostering a spirit of support and self-sufficiency within the black community, organizers of the Million Man March sought to use the event as a publicity campaign aimed at combating the negative racial stereotypes in the American media and in popular culture. March organizers were dismayed by the sweeping stereotypes they thought white America seemed to draw from the coverage of such figures as Willie Horton, O. J. Simpson, and Mike Tyson.

Stating that &quot;black men have been designated by the culture as the sacrificial lambs for male evil&quot;, event organizers asked the black men in attendance to make a public display of their commitment to responsible and constructive behavior that would give the mass media positive imagery to broadcast.

==Program==
Although various organizations, charities, and vendors had booths and displays at the rally, the focal point of the day was the stage set up on the west front grounds of the United States Capitol building. The day&#x27;s events were broken down into several sessions: Early Morning Glory (6 am–7:30am), Sankofa: Lessons from the Past Linkages to the Future (8 am–10:30 am), Affirmation/Responsibility (11 am–2 pm), and Atonement and (2:30 pm–4 pm).

==Structure of speeches==
The organizers of the event took steps to lift the march from a purely political level to a spiritual one, hoping to inspire attendees and honored guests to move beyond &quot;articulation of black grievances&quot; to a state of spiritual healing. Speakers at the event structured their talks around three themes: atonement, , and . The Day of Atonement became a second name for the event and for some came to represent the motivation of the Million Man movement. In the words of one man who was in attendance, Marchers aimed at &quot;being at one with ourselves, the Most High, and our people&quot;.

Beyond the most basic call for atonement leaders of the March also called for reconciliation or a state of harmony between members of the black community and their God. Speakers called participants to &quot;settle disputes, overcome conflicts, put aside grudges and hatreds&quot; and unite in an effort to create a productive and supportive black community that fosters in each person the ability to &quot;seek the good, find it, embrace it, and build on it.&quot; Finally, the leaders of the March challenged participants and their families at home to &quot;expand [our] commitment to responsibility in personal conduct…and in obligations to the community&quot;.

===Day of Absence===
While male leaders took primary responsibility for planning and participating in the events in Washington, female leaders organized a parallel activity called the National Day of Absence. In the spirit of unity and atonement, these leaders issued a call for all Black people not in attendance at the March to recognize October 16, 1995, as a sacred day meant for self-reflection and spiritual reconciliation. All Black Americans were encouraged to stay home from their work, school, athletic, entertainment activities and various other daily responsibilities on the Day of Absence.

Instead of partaking in their usual routines, participants were instructed to gather at places of worship and to hold teach-ins at their homes in order to meditate on the role and responsibility of blacks in America. Further, the day was intended to serve as an occasion for mass voter registration and contribution to the establishment of a Black Economic Development Fund.

==Crowd size==
Because of the name of the event, the number of attendees was a primary measure of its success and estimating the crowd size, always a contentious issue reached new heights in bitterness. March organizers estimated the crowd size at between 1.5 to 2 million people but were incensed when the United States Park Police officially estimated the crowd size at 400,000. Farrakhan threatened to sue the National Park Service because of the low estimate from the Park Police.

Three days after the march, Farouk El-Baz, director of the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University released a controversial estimate of 870,000 people with a margin of error of 25%, meaning that the crowd could have been as small as 655,000 or as large as 1.1 million. It later revised that figure to 837,000, with a 20% margin of error (669,600 to 1,004,400). The Park Service never retracted its estimate.

After the Million Man March, the Park Police ceased making official crowd size estimates. Roger G. Kennedy, the Director of the National Park Service, said that his agency planned to study the possibility of no longer counting crowds, noting that most organizations that sponsor large events complain that Park Service estimates are too low. When it prepared the 1997 appropriations bill for the United States Department of the Interior, the Committee on Appropriations of the United States House of Representatives stated in a June 1996 report that accompanied the bill that the Committee had not provided any funding for crowd counting activities associated with gatherings held on federal property in Washington, D.C. The report further stated that if event organizers wish to have crowd estimates, they should hire a private sector firm to conduct the count.

==Media reaction==
Louis Farrakhan acquired unfavorable attention from African-American Christians and was compared to &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot; by the Jewish community for anti-Jewish rhetoric and views. His supporters said that Farrakhan was &quot;against those Jews who have sacrificed their deep moral-religious heritage for a set of values grounded in capitalist exploitation and oppression.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; observed that Farrakhan&#x27;s apparent political agenda could become a concern for the Democratic Party, as his effort to register black men as independent voters could create a &quot;voting bloc [with a] mix of social conservatism, economic &#x27;empowerment&#x27; and black solidarity.&quot;

Richard Lacayo and Sam Allis wrote that Farrakhan may have organized the march to &quot;simply prove that he was the man who could make it happen; he would then capitalize on the prominence he hoped it would confer.&quot;

===Sexism===
A group of black feminists including Angela Davis, Barbara Ransby, Evelynn Hammonds and Kimberlé Crenshaw formed an alliance called the African American Agenda 2000 to oppose the Million Man March. E. Frances White would recall in 2010 that the march had &quot;frightened many black feminists because we felt that it would herald a dramatic resurgence in black male sexism.&quot;

Creating a separation in the movement became a topic of great controversy since it has been argued that, &quot;Organizers excluded women from the march to send a two-part message&quot; that men need to improve their character and women need to recognize their place &quot;in the home.&quot;

In his 2005 book &quot;New Black Man,&quot; Mark Anthony Neal emphasizes the &quot;small percentage of black women in attendance that day.&quot; Neal offers the perspective of Debra Dickerson, a woman writer who attended the march: &quot;Dickerson noted the aura of politeness and chivalry she experienced walking...there was an element of performance taking place that day for international media, corporate America.&quot; The Million Man March that excluded black women was a &quot;call for atonement [that] spoke to the need for those black men engaged in acts of criminality, violence, and blatant misogyny.&quot; However, black women faced backlash for exposing the March&#x27;s flaws, such as &quot;gender apartheid and nostalgia for patriarchy.&quot;

==20th anniversary==
Farrakhan held the 20th Anniversary of the Million Man March: Justice or Else on October 10, 2015, in Washington, D.C.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; published an opinion piece by Charles M. Blow, who found it difficult to &quot;separate the march from the messenger&quot;, and criticized Minister Farrakhan&#x27;s speech, calling it homophobic and patriarchal. In an opinion piece for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Janell Ross called Farrakhan&#x27;s speech &quot;striking&quot;, a &quot;stemwinder&quot;, and the &quot;apex&quot; of the event.

==Cultural impact==

The 1996 motion picture &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; was released exactly one year to the day of this event, directed by Spike Lee as his first movie that he did not act in himself. The road-movie plot has a group of African Americans on the titular bus on the way to the Million Man March.

<doc id="583461" wikidata="Q20730913" url="?curid=583461" title="Stratum (linguistics)">
<text>In linguistics, a stratum (Latin for &#x27;layer&#x27;) or strate is a historical layer of language that influences or is influenced by another language through contact. The notion of &quot;strata&quot; was first developed by the Italian linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli, and became known in the English-speaking world through the work of two different authors in 1932.

Both concepts apply to a situation where an intrusive language establishes itself in the territory of another, typically as the result of migration. Whether the superstratum case (the local language persists and the intrusive language disappears) or the substratum one (the local language disappears and the intrusive language persists) applies will normally only be evident after several generations, during which the intrusive language exists within a diaspora culture.

In order for the intrusive language to persist, the &quot;substratum&quot; case, the immigrant population will either need to take the position of a political elite or immigrate in significant numbers relative to the local population, i.e., the intrusion qualifies as an invasion or colonisation. An example would be the Roman Empire giving rise to Romance languages outside Italy, displacing Gaulish and many other Indo-European languages.

The &quot;superstratum&quot; case refers to elite invading populations that eventually adopt the language of the native lower classes. An example would be the Burgundians and Franks in France, who eventually abandoned their Germanic dialects in favor of other Indo-European languages of the Romance branch, profoundly influencing the local speech in the process.

==Substratum ==
A substratum (plural: substrata) or substrate is a language that an intrusive language influences, which may or may not ultimately change it to become a new language. The term is also used of substrate interference, i.e. the influence the substratum language exerts on the replacing language. According to some classifications, this is one of three main types of linguistic interference: substratum interference differs from both adstratum, which involves no language replacement but rather mutual borrowing between languages of equal &quot;value&quot;, and superstratum, which refers to the influence a socially dominating language has on another, receding language that might eventually be relegated to the status of a substratum language.

In a typical case of substrate interference, a Language A occupies a given territory and another Language B arrives in the same territory, brought, for example, with migrations of population. Language B then begins to supplant language A: the speakers of Language A abandon their own language in favor of the other language, generally because they believe that it will help them achieve certain goals within government, the workplace, and in social settings. During the language shift, the receding language A still influences language B, for example, through the transfer of loanwords, place names, or grammatical patterns from A to B.

In most cases, the ability to identify substrate influence in a language requires knowledge of the structure of the substrate language. This can be acquired in numerous ways:
* The substrate language, or some later descendant of it, still survives in a part of its former range;
* Written records of the substrate language may exist to various degrees;
* The substrate language itself may be unknown entirely, but it may have surviving close relatives that can be used as a base of comparison.

One of the first-identified cases of substrate influence is an example of a substrate language of the second type: Gaulish, from the ancient Celtic people the Gauls. The Gauls lived in the modern French-speaking territory before the arrival of the Romans, namely the invasion of Julius Caesar&#x27;s army. Given the cultural, economic and political advantages that came with being a Latin speaker, the Gauls eventually abandoned their language in favor of the language brought to them by the Romans, which evolved in this region, until eventually it took the form of the French language that is known today. The Gaulish speech disappeared in the late Roman era, but remnants of its vocabulary survive in some French words, approximately 200, as well as place-names of Gaulish origin.

It is posited that some structural changes in French were shaped at least in part by Gaulish influence including diachronic sound changes and sandhi phenomena due to the retention of Gaulish phonetic patterns after the adoption of Latin, calques such as &quot;aveugle&quot; (&quot;blind&quot;, literally without eyes, from Latin &quot;ab oculis&quot;, which was a calque on the Gaulish word with the same semantic construction as modern French) with other Celtic calques possibly including &quot;oui&quot;, the word for yes, while syntactic and morphological effects are also posited.

Other examples of substrate languages are the influence of the now extinct North Germanic Norn language on the Scots dialects of the Shetland and Orkney islands. In the Arab Middle East and North Africa, colloquial Arabic dialects, most especially Levantine, Egyptian, and Maghreb dialects, often exhibit significant substrata from other regional Semitic (especially Aramaic), Iranian, and Berber languages. Yemeni Arabic has Modern South Arabian, Old South Arabian and Himyaritic substrata.

Typically, Creole languages have multiple substrata, with the actual influence of such languages being indeterminate.

===Unattested substrata===
In the absence of all three lines of evidence mentioned above, linguistic substrata may be difficult to detect. Substantial indirect evidence is needed to infer the former existence of a substrate. The nonexistence of a substrate is difficult to show, and to avoid digressing into speculation, burden of proof must lie on the side of the scholar claiming the influence of a substrate. The principle of uniformitarianism and results from the study of human genetics suggest that many languages have formerly existed that have since then been replaced under expansive language families, such as Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Uralic or Bantu. However, it is not a given that such expansive languages would have acquired substratum influence from the languages they have replaced.

Several examples of this type of substratum have still been claimed. For example, the earliest form of the Germanic languages may have been influenced by a non-Indo-European language, purportedly the source of about one quarter of the most ancient Germanic vocabulary. There are similar arguments for a Sanskrit substrate, a Greek one, and a substrate underlying the Sami languages. Relatively clear examples are the Finno-Ugric languages of the Chude and the &quot;Volga Finns&quot; (Merya, Muromian, and Meshcheran): while unattested, their existence has been noted in medieval chronicles, and one or more of them have left substantial influence in the Northern Russian dialects.

By contrast, more contentious cases are the Vasconic substratum theory and Old European hydronymy, which hypothesize large families of substrate languages across western Europe. Some smaller-scale unattested substrates that remain under debate involve alleged extinct branches of the Indo-European family, such as &quot;Nordwestblock&quot; substrate in the Germanic languages, and a &quot;Temematic&quot; substrate in Balto-Slavic, proposed by Georg Holzer. The name &quot;Temematic&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;tenuis, media, media aspirata, tenuis&quot;, referencing a sound shift presumed common to the group.

When a substrate language or its close relatives cannot be directly studied, their investigation is rooted in the study of etymology and linguistic typology. The study of unattested substrata often begins from the study of &quot;substrate words&quot;, which lack a clear etymology. Such words can in principle still be native inheritance, lost everywhere else in the language family, but they might in principle also originate from a substrate. The sound structure of words of unknown origin — their phonology and morphology — can often suggest hints in either direction.

So can their meaning: words referring to the natural landscape, in particular indigenous fauna and flora, have often been found especially likely to derive from substrate languages. None of these conditions, is sufficient by itself to claim any one word as originating from an unknown substratum. Occasionally words that have been proposed to be of substrate origin will be found out to have cognates in more distantly related languages after all, and therefore likely native: an example is Proto-Indo-European &quot;*mori&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27;, found widely in the northern and western Indo-European languages, but in more eastern Indo-European languages only in Ossetic.

===Concept history===
Although the influence of the prior language when a community speaks, and adopts, a new one may have been informally acknowledged beforehand, the concept was formalized and popularized initially in the late 19th century. As historical phonology emerged as a discipline, the initial dominant viewpoint was that influences from language contact on phonology and grammar should be assumed to be marginal, and an internal explanation should always be favored if possible. As articulated by Max Mueller in 1870, (&quot;there are no mixed languages&quot;). In the 1880s, dissent began to crystallize against this viewpoint. Within Romance language linguistics, the 1881 &quot;Lettere glottologiche&quot; of Graziadio Isaia Ascoli argued that the early phonological development of French and other Gallo-Romance languages was shaped by the retention by Celts of their &quot;oral dispositions&quot; even after they had switched to Latin.

In 1884, Hugo Schuchardt&#x27;s related but distinct concept of creole languages was used to counter Mueller&#x27;s view. In modern historical linguistics, debate persists on the details of how language contact may induce structural changes. The respective extremes of &quot;all change is contact&quot; and &quot;there are no structural changes ever&quot; have largely been abandoned in favor of a set of conventions on how to demonstrate contact induced structural changes. These include adequate knowledge of the two languages in question, a historical explanation, and evidence that the contact-induced phenomenon did not exist in the recipient language before contact, among other guidelines.

==Superstratum==
A superstratum (plural: superstrata) or superstrate offers the counterpart to a substratum. When a different language influences a base language to result in a new language, linguists label the influencing language a superstratum and the influenced language a substratum.

A superstrate may also represent an imposed linguistic element akin to what occurred with English and Norman after the Norman Conquest of 1066 when use of the English language carried low prestige. The international scientific vocabulary coinages from Greek and Latin roots adopted by European languages (and subsequently by other languages) to describe scientific topics (sociology, zoology, philosophy, botany, medicine, all &quot;-logy&quot; words, etc.) can also be termed a superstratum, although for this last case, &quot;adstratum&quot; might be a better designation (despite the prestige of science and of its language). In the case of French, for example, Latin is the superstrate and Gaulish the substrate.

Some linguists contend that Japanese (and Japonic languages in general) consists of an Altaic superstratum projected onto an Austronesian substratum. Some scholars also argue for the existence of Altaic superstrate influences on varieties of Chinese spoken in Northern China. In this case, however, the superstratum refers to influence, not language succession. Other views detect &quot;sub&quot;strate effects.

==Adstratum==

An adstratum (plural: adstrata) or adstrate is a language that influences another language by virtue of geographic proximity, not by virtue of its relative prestige. For example, early in England&#x27;s history, Old Norse served as an adstrate, contributing to the lexical structure of Old English.

The phenomenon is less common today in standardized linguistic varieties and more common in colloquial forms of speech. Modern nations tend to favour a single linguistic variety, often corresponding to the dialect of the capital and other important regions, over others.

In India, where dozens of languages are widespread, many languages could be said to share an adstratal relationship, but Hindi is certainly a dominant adstrate in North India.

A different example would be the sociolinguistic situation in Belgium, where the French and Dutch languages have roughly the same status. They could justifiably be called adstrates to each other as each has provided a large set of lexical specifications to the other.

The term adstratum is also used to identify systematic influences or a layer of borrowings in a given language from another language, independently of whether the two languages continue coexisting as separate entities. Many modern languages have an appreciable adstratum from English, due both to the cultural influence and economic preponderance of the United States on international markets, and the earlier colonization by the British Empire that made English a global lingua franca. The Greek and Latin coinages adopted by European languages, including English and now languages worldwide, to describe scientific topics, sociology, medicine, anatomy, biology, all the &#x27;-logy&#x27; words, etc., are also justifiably called adstrata.

Another example is found in Spanish and Portuguese, which contain a heavy Semitic, particularly Arabic, adstratum. Yiddish is a linguistic variety of High German with adstrata from Hebrew and Aramaic, mostly in the sphere of religion. Slavic languages were linked geographically to Yiddish-speaking villages in Eastern Europe for centuries up until the Holocaust.

<text>James Ferguson (August 31, 1797 – September 26, 1867) was a Scottish-born American astronomer and engineer, who made the first discovery of an asteroid from North America (31 Euphrosyne).

==Biography==
James Ferguson was born in Scotland on August 31, 1797, and his family moved to the United states in 1800.

Between the ages of 17 and 19, as an assistant engineer, he helped to build the Erie Canal. Afterwards he was appointed as an astronomical surveyor, surveying the U.S. Northwest boarder as part of the Treaty of Ghent

Starting in 1847, he worked at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, DC. He worked on the 9.6 inch refractor telescope.

Ferguson was confirmed at the Church of the Epiphany in 1863.

Ferguson was considered a bright computer and had written 84 papers as well as contributions to scientific magazines.

==Discoveries==
Throughout the years, Ferguson discovered three minor planets. The first, 31 Euphrosyne, is the first numbered minor planet to be discovered from North America.

In 1850, he discovered 50 Virginia. The asteroid was also independently discovered by Robert Luther, who reported it first, but is now credited to Ferguson.

In 1850, he &quot;lost&quot; a star that he had been observing, which Lt. Matthew Maury, the superintendent of the Observatory, claimed was evidence for a 9th planet (Pluto had not yet been discovered). In 1878, however, CHF Peters, director of the Hamilton College Observatory in New York, showed that the star had not in fact vanished, and that the previous results had been due to human error.

==Honors and awards==
The asteroid 1745 Ferguson, discovered from the same observatory, was later named in his honour.

He was awarded the Lalande Prize twice, in 1854 and in 1860.

<text>Kieron Owen Timothy Quinn (born 26 July 1949, Ipswich, Queensland) is a former Australian politician.

Quinn was a teacher who entered local politics in 1985 as the alderman for The Gabba ward at an election the Harvey Labor administration lost. He served in opposition for two terms before rising to civic cabinet in the 1991 Soorley Labor election victory, with Labor achieving an 18% swing against incumbent Lord Mayor Liberal Sallyanne Atkinson.

Quinn took the reins in Civic Cabinet of Development and Planning and continued in this role for the next 12 years, playing an important role during this period of dramatic transformation in Brisbane. Urban Renewal of the inner city commenced, Local Area Plans were established in conjunction with character housing protection provision to retain Brisbane&#x27;s distinctive &quot;tin and timber&#x27; character. Ugly &quot;six pack&quot; units were banned with design guidelines overhauled and Suburban Centre Improvement Schemes were also commenced in 1996 to revitalise traditional local shopping strips and are now widespread throughout the city.

Quinn became Lord Mayor of Brisbane following Lord Mayor Jim Soorley&#x27;s retirement from politics in 2003 after serving as deputy mayor since 1997.

Quinn, part of the left wing faction of the Labor Party, was subsequently defeated by Campbell Newman in March 2004.

== Community ==

Quinn was appointed (2006–12) as a board director of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s International Award – Australia and during this period was the Queensland chair for the award. He also served as the chair of the National IT Committee 2010–2012.

<text>James Gerard Soorley (born 8 April 1951) is an Australian lobbyist and former politician. He served as Labor Lord Mayor of Brisbane from 1991 to 2003. A laicised Catholic priest, Soorley has a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in psychology, from Macquarie University, and a Master of Arts in organisational psychology from Loyola University Chicago.

==Lord Mayor of Brisbane==

The 1991 election was a close election with Soorley just edging out then-Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson through the preferences of Drew Hutton, the Greens candidate. Soorley was not expected to wrest the Lord Mayoralty from the very popular first female (and first Liberal Party) mayor of Brisbane. The transition period between Atkinson&#x27;s administration and the incoming Soorley administration was difficult, with the outgoing Atkinson refusing to believe she had lost the election for many weeks afterward.

Soorley was a virtual &quot;unknown&quot; at that first election, but was one of the few Australian politicians to increase his popular vote in each of the next three elections, standing as Lord Mayor for 13 years.

Soorley defeated the following Liberal candidates: 1991: Sallyanne Atkinson; 1994: Bob Ward; 1997: Bob Mills; and 2000: Gail Austen.

==Accomplishments==

Some of the changes in Brisbane Soorley has been credited with include allowing widespread footpath dining, introduction of the CityCat ferries, advancing the Busway system, building the Inner City Bypass, starting Brisbane Festival including the popular Riverfire fireworks and the River Feast, bringing all sewage treatment up to at least secondary treatment standards (with removal of nitrogen and phosphorus to additional standards), a citywide recycling program, gas CNG powered buses, starting air conditioning on buses, accelerating the purchase of &quot;at risk&quot; bushland, Implementing a system of long term re-habilitation for old municipal solid waste tips and a long-term plan to link riverfront land and open it up to the people of Brisbane through a series of pathways called Riverwalk.

Soorley also instituted a number of institutional changes including a 24/7 Call Centre; &quot;business style&quot; accounting for budgets and annual reporting, enterprise bargaining, significant changes to leave and other entitlements, increased employment opportunities through increased apprenticeships, traineeships and community jobs programs, including a nationally awarded program for &quot;at risk youth&quot; who were recovering from drug addiction, as well as a shift from Brisbane Council being only concerned with &quot;rates, roads, rubbish&quot; to taking on issues such as drug use, homelessness, domestic violence and social justice.

Before leaving office, Soorley started the major infrastructure projects, such as the Eleanor Schonell Bridge (previously known as the Green Bridge) from Dutton Park to St Lucia and North-South Bypass Tunnel.

In 1995, Soorley ended Brisbane&#x27;s sister city relationship with the French Riviera town of Nice due to France&#x27;s resumption of nuclear testing, a move which he described as a &quot;symbolic protest.&quot;

==Post-political career==
Soorley currently writes a weekly column for &quot;The Sunday Mail&quot; and is a registered lobbyist in Queensland. As of 2017, he is Chairman of Sunshine Coast water business Unitywater, and a board member of government-owned electricity generation company CS Energy.

<text>Ombre (, pronounced &quot;omber&quot;) or l&#x27;Hombre is a fast-moving seventeenth-century trick-taking card game for three players and &quot;the most successful card game ever invented.&quot;

Its history began in Spain around the end of the 16th century as a four-person game. It is one of the earliest card games known in Europe and by far the most classic game of its type, directly ancestral to Euchre, Boston and Solo Whist. Despite its difficult rules, complicated point score and strange foreign terms, it swept Europe in the last quarter of the 17th century, becoming &quot;Lomber&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Hombre&quot; in Germany, &quot;Lumbur&quot; in Austria and &quot;Ombre&quot; (originally pronounced &#x27;umber&#x27;) in England, occupying a position of prestige similar to contract bridge today. Ombre eventually developed into a whole family of related games such as the four-hand Quadrille, three-hand Tritrille, five-hand Quintille and six-hand Sextille, as well as German Solo, Austrian Préférence and Swedish Vira, itself &quot;one of the most complex card games ever devised.&quot; Other games borrowed features from Ombre such as bidding; for example, the gambling game of Bête, formerly known as Homme, and the tarot game of Taroc l&#x27;Hombre. 

==History==

The historical importance of Ombre in the field of playing cards is the fact that it was the first card game in which a trump suit was established by bidding rather than by the random process of turning the first card of the stock. This game developed from Triunfo, though it was from L&#x27;Hombre that the idea of bidding was adopted into other card games such as Skat, and Tarot, which owes Hombre a good portion of its betting system as well.

Ombre&#x27;s precise origins are unknown, but it reached England and France at about the same time. The earliest French reference dates to 1671 and it is recorded in England as early as 1661 with a set of rules being published in 1662. The game continued to be in vogue in almost every corner of Europe from the late 17th through the 18th centuries.

As with most games, Ombre acquired many variations of increasing complexity over the years, until its popularity was eclipsed by the second quarter of the 18th century by a new four player French variant called Quadrille, later displaced by the English Whist. Other lines of descent and hybridization produced three-handed games like Preference and four-handed ones such as German Solo and Mediateur. Under the name Tresillo, it survived in parts of Spain during the nineteenth century, as Voltarete in Portugal and Brazil, as Rocambor in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia in the twentieth century, and it is still played as L&#x27;Hombre in Denmark, mostly in Jutland and on the island of Funen, where it is organized by the Danish Hombre Union (&quot;Dansk L&#x27;hombre-Union&quot;), as well as in the Faroe Islands (as Lumbur) and Iceland (as Lomber). Today, Tresillo survives in Spain and Rocambor is still reported in South America (Bolivia and Peru). It may still exist in Portugal under the name Mediator.

Daines Barrington, English antiquary and naturalist, says that Ombre was probably introduced in England by Catherine of Braganza, the Queen of Charles II, as Edmund Waller, the court poet, had a poem entitled &quot;On a Card Torn at Ombre by the Queen&quot;. She was such a keen player, as were so many members of English high society by the end of 1674, that the Lower House of Parliament proposed to pass an Act against the playing of Ombre, or at least to limit the stakes at £5, a proposition received as &quot;ridiculous&quot; at that time. But a small book of rules, &quot;The Royal game of the ombre written at the request of divers honourable persons&quot;, published in London in 1660, would support the inference that the game was known in England before the Restoration.

In the late 18th century, the three player version of its offshoot, German Solo, was often referred to as &quot;German Ombre&quot; (&quot;Dütsch Lumber&quot; or &quot;Deutsche L&#x27;Hombre&quot;), a game popular with &quot;the lower classes&quot; in northern Germany.

==Etymology==
Ombre takes its name from the Spanish phrase originally used by the player who declared trumps: &quot;Yo soy el hombre&quot;, i.e., &quot;I am the man&quot;. It appears to be merely an alteration of the game Primero and it is to be presumed that it was invented prior to the publication of the Dictionary of Sebastián de Covarrubias in 1611, although it makes no mention of it. The spelling changed from &quot;Hombre&quot; to &quot;Ombre&quot; in English due to a misunderstanding that the name came from the French &quot;ombre&quot; meaning &quot;shadow.&quot;

Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Compleat Gamester&quot; says that &quot;there were several sorts of this game, but that which the chief was called &quot;Renegado&quot;, at which three only could play, and to whom were dealt nine cards apiece so that by discarding the eights, nines and tens, there would remain thirteen cards in the stock&quot;. Seymour&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Gamester&quot; (1722) contains a frontispiece representing a party of rank playing it and describes it as a game so much in fashion that at its peak by the turn of the eighteenth century it inspired a unique form of furniture: a three-sided card table. According to Jean-Baptiste Bullet, writer and professor of divinity at the University of Besançon, the Spaniards, occasionally also called the game &quot;Manilla&quot; after the name of the second matador, a word signifying a slayer in Spanish.

==Summary==
Ombre is a three-handed game in which a single player, originally known as Ombre or l&#x27;Hombre (the man), plays against his two opponents. The game is traditionally played with a forty-card Spanish-suited deck with suits of coins and cups (round) and swords and clubs (long), but when it spread to Northern Europe French-suited cards with suits of diamonds and hearts (red) and spades and clubs (black) were usually substituted.

Once the cards are dealt, players bid for the right to choose what suit will be trumps. The trump maker (Ombre) undertakes to win more tricks than either of the other players, and wins the pool if successful. If an opponent of the Ombre wins the most tricks the Ombre pays that opponent. If there is a tie for most tricks the Ombre pays into the pool. There are additional payments for various feats such as winning all the tricks (Vole).

==Ombre Renegado==
By the 17th century, when it caught on outside Spain, most people were playing a three-player variation called &quot;Renegado&quot; first described in 1663 in Madrid. The terms used were those in English, which were anglicized versions of French versions of the original Spanish words.

===Deck===
Traditionally, a Spanish 40-card deck is used, but a French-suited deck may be substituted in which case spades correspond to swords, clubs to clubs, hearts to cups and diamonds to coins. The eights, nines and tens can be stripped out of a standard 52-card deck to make a suitable 40-card deck.

===Rank of cards===
The rank of the cards in the game depends on whether a black (long) or a red (round) suit is chosen as trumps. The basic ranking of numerals is reversed in red suits, being 7 low; and a red suit is always one card longer than a black one of the same status, whether trump or plain.

The black aces are permanent trumps, and the top three trumps are called &quot;matadors&quot; or &quot;estuches&quot;:

# (&quot;spadille&quot;)
#black 2 or red 7 (&quot;manille&quot;)
# (&quot;basto&quot;)

When a red suit is trumps, the fourth highest trump is the , or , called &quot;punto&quot;, but it does not have the status of a matador.

===Deal===
Whoever draws the highest card from the deck becomes the dealer; the turn to deal and play rotates counter-clockwise. Before play, the dealer antes five chips to the pool, deals nine cards in batches of three, and places the remaining thirteen face down on the playing surface to form the stock, or talon.

===Bid===
Whoever bids highest becomes Ombre, chooses trumps, and seeks to win more tricks than either opponent individually. Thus, five or more wins, and four wins if the others split three-two. The possible bids are, from low to high:

#Entrada: Ombre announces trumps, discards, and draws replacements from the stock.
#Vuelta: Ombre turns the top card of the stock to determine trumps, discards and draws.
#Solo: Ombre announces trumps, but plays without discarding and drawing.

In turn, each player may pass or bid, and having passed cannot bid again. Each bid must be higher than the last. However, a player who has made a lower bid, and not yet passed, may raise his bid to equal that of the previous player, unless overcalled again. Unless playing Solo, Ombre may discard as many cards as he likes before drawing the same number from the stock. Solo or not, both opponents may then discard and draw for themselves. As it is advantageous for one of the defenders to have the stronger hand, they may agree as to which is to exchange first. Whoever does so may draw any number of cards up to eight. Rules vary considerably as to whether any untaken cards are left down or turned face up, and the point should be agreed before play.

===Play===
Eldest leads first and the winner of each trick leads to the next. The trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led or by the highest trump if any are played. Normally, suit must be followed if possible, otherwise any card may be played. Matadors, however, can only be forced by higher matadors, not by lower ones or trumps. That is, if the player&#x27;s only trumps are matadors he need not follow to a trump, but may discard (&quot;Renege&quot;) instead. However, if a higher matador is led, and his only trump is a lower one, he is obliged to play it.

If Ombre takes the first five tricks straight off, he can claim the game won without need for further play. If instead he leads to the sixth, he thereby obligates himself to win all nine (&quot;Vole&quot;), thus increasing his potential winnings or penalties. If Ombre thinks he cannot win, he may surrender at any time before playing to the fourth trick, but he may not do this if playing a &quot;Solo&quot;. In a &quot;Vuelta&quot;, his surrender must be accepted by both opponents. However, if the game played was &quot;Entrada&quot;, either opponent may himself take over the role of Ombre and play the rest of the hand as if he had made the bid himself.

===Scoring===
There are three possible outcomes, which are:

#Sacada: Ombre wins more tricks than any other player. Ombre takes the pool.
#Puesta: There is a tie for most tricks. Ombre pays the pool, as described under Penalties.
#Codille: One opponent wins more tricks than any other player. Ombre pays the winning opponent as described under Penalties.

If the Ombre wins, in addition to collecting the pool he is paid by each opponent.

#Entrada: Value of 5 chips.
#Vuelta: Value of 7 chips.
#Solo: Value of 15 chips, plus any of the following bonuses:
#*Vole: To win nine tricks, value of 25 chips (5 from the pot and 10 from each player).
#*Primeras: To win the first five tricks and stop, value of 3 chips.
#*Estuches: Extra payment when holding or lacking at least the top three trumps, value of 1 each.

===Penalties===
If Ombre loses &quot;Puesta&quot;, he doubles the pool and pays five chips for each player in the game. If Ombre loses &quot;Codille&quot;, he pays the same as for a &quot;Puesta&quot;, but to the player who won instead of to the pot. These penalties are further increased as described above for &quot;Primeras&quot;, and if he loses the first five tricks, and &quot;Estuches&quot;, he pays one per each consecutive trump. If Ombre fails to win all nine tricks after leading to the sixth, he pays 30 to each opponent, less 2 if he played &quot;Vuelta&quot;, and 10 if he played Solo, less also the number of &quot;Estuches&quot; applicable.

===Rule variations===

====Gascarola====
If all pass immediately, lower bids may be made so as to avoid a redeal. They include:

*Voltereta: is a game equivalent to &quot;Entrada&quot;, where Ombre turns the first card of the stock for trump, discards and draws up to 5 cards to complete the hand. If the turned-up card is Spadilla, the game then counts as &quot;Vuelta&quot;
*Gascarola: &quot;gascarille&quot;, &quot;cascarilla&quot;, &quot;cascarola&quot;, &quot;casco&quot;, &quot;casca&quot;, is an implement on the rules of the game. If all three players pass, each player in turn may bid &quot;casca&quot;. If the auction is won by a &quot;Gascarola&quot; bid, the declarer then takes eight cards from the stock, chooses one of his own cards to supplement the eight, but he also has the option to discard all nine and take nine others from the stock. Based on his hand, he names a trump suit. The defenders then exchange with the remaining five or four cards in the stock, and an &quot;Entrada&quot; contract is played and scored normally.

====Vole====
Vole, &quot;Contrabola&quot;: No one discards, Hombre announces a trump suit of which he holds at least one, and aims to lose every trick. If successful, he wins as if the game was &quot;Entrada&quot;, if not it counts as &quot;Puesta&quot;.

Spadille Forcé, &quot;Force Spadille&quot;: if all pass without bidding, whoever holds &quot;Spadille&quot; or &quot;Basto&quot;, must take the role as Ombre, or by eldest if no one does. He discards up to 8 cards, draws replacements from the stock and then announces trumps. The game counts as &quot;Entrada&quot;.

==Game variations==

===Two-handed Ombre===
Ombre may be played sometimes by two players, for lack of a third person. It is played exactly as for three hands, but a whole suit is removed from the pack, either Diamonds or Hearts, so that 30 cards remain. Deal eight cards in batches of 2&#x27;s and stock the remaining 12 on the table. Ombre may take as many cards as he wants up to eight and the other player may take the rest. When the trump is named, the player is paid for Matadors. Ombre is intended to make five tricks to win the stake. If the tricks are divided by four, the game is then considered &quot;Remise&quot;. If the other player makes five, he wins by &quot;Codille&quot;.

===Four-handed Ombre===
In this variation, first described in 1669 in Zaragoza, usually only three players are active at a time. The player opposite the dealer sits out, but takes part in the payment after the play as though he were a defender. If three players pass, the fourth player picks up all 13 cards from the stock and discards four. He chooses trump then and plays as declarer against the other three, who cannot exchange any cards, since the stock is already used up. The contract counts as &quot;Entrada&quot;. This version was also played in Germany where the fourth player was called the King (&quot;König&quot;) or, in Low German, the &quot;one who sits still&quot; (&quot;Stillsitter&quot;).

===Five-handed Ombre===
In this five-handed variation called &quot;Cinquillo&quot;, first described around 1683, the players are dealt eight cards each, after staking down a fifth to the pool, therefore no discard is possible. Bidding may be for Ask Leave, when Ombre calls a king seeking for a partner. If the first four players pass, the fifth may play Solo. Ombre is obliged to win five tricks, otherwise he loses. He names trump and if between them five tricks can be won, Ombre wins, sharing between them two-thirds of the pool for Ombre and one-third for his partner. If they both make only three tricks the game is Remise, and Ombre is to lay down two-thirds of the pool and his partner one.

==Poetry==
The game of Ombre is Belinda&#x27;s game in Alexander Pope&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, written in 1714.
The progress of the game is described in such detail that Lord Aldenham was able to reconstruct the exact deal and play of the cards.

It is also mentioned in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;.

<doc id="583477" wikidata="Q5384959" url="?curid=583477" title="Erasmus Hall High School">
<text>Erasmus Hall High School was a four-year public high school located at 899–925 Flatbush Avenue between Church and Snyder Avenues in the Flatbush neighborhood of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It was founded in 1786 as Erasmus Hall Academy, a private institution of higher learning named for the scholar Desiderius Erasmus, known as Erasmus of Rotterdam, a Dutch Renaissance humanist and Catholic Christian theologian. The school was the first secondary school chartered by the New York State Regents. The clapboard-sided, Georgian-Federal-style building, constructed on land donated by the Flatbush Reformed Dutch Church, was turned over to the public school system in 1896.

Around the start of the 20th century, Brooklyn experienced a rapidly growing population, and the original small school was enlarged with the addition of several wings and the purchase of several nearby buildings. In 1904, the Board of Education began a new building campaign to meet the needs of the burgeoning student population. The Superintendent of School Buildings, architect C. B. J. Snyder, designed a series of buildings to be constructed as needed, around an open quadrangle, while continuing to use the old building in the center of the courtyard. The original Academy building, which still stands in the courtyard of the current school, served the students of Erasmus Hall in three different centuries. Now a designated New York City Landmark and listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the building is a museum exhibiting the school&#x27;s history.

Due to poor academic scores, the city closed Erasmus Hall High School in 1994, turning the building into Erasmus Hall Educational Campus and using it as the location for five separate small schools.

==History==

===Erasmus Hall Academy===
Erasmus Hall Academy was founded as a private school by Reverend John H. Livingston and Senator John Vanderbilt in 1786 and became the first secondary school chartered by the New York State Board of Regents. Land was donated by the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church for the building and contributions were collected for “an institution of higher learning,” from leading citizens such as Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton, Peter Lefferts and Robert Livingston.

The wood-framed, clapboard-sided, Georgian and Federal style school building, two and one-half stories tall with hipped roof, was opened in 1787 with 26 students. Through the years, various wings were added to the academy building and later removed.

Erasmus Hall Academy began accepting female students in 1801, and in 1803 it incorporated the village school of Flatbush. The village evolved into a city, and started a public school system that competed with Erasmus for its student body. As a result, there was a steady decline in its enrollment until in 1896 enrollment was reduced to 150 boys and girls, up from the 105 boys who were registered in the school in 1795. The board of trustees decided to donate the academy to the public school system with the following resolution by the board of trustees:

That the Board of Trustees offer the grounds of the Academy to the Board of Education of the City of Brooklyn upon the following conditions, viz: In consideration of the gift of the land the Board of Education are to erect and maintain upon said land a High School Building of the same character and grade as other High School Buildings in the City of Brooklyn.

===Erasmus Hall High School===
Following the agreement with the Erasmus Hall Board of Trustees, the Board of Education of the City of Brooklyn requested proposals for a design for a new school building. Twenty architects responded with plans, several of which were published in contemporary architectural periodicals.

It soon became clear that none of these plans could be erected for less than a million dollars, and since that was considered too expensive, the project was dropped. The Brooklyn Board of Education did however, approve &quot;temporary additions&quot; to the school to accommodate the growing population and purchased additional property to allow more room to build a new school.

With the consolidation of the City of New York in 1898, the highly varied needs of schools in all the boroughs came under the purview of the New York City school board. This board had to cope with a sizable number of independently administered school districts, each with its own curricula, grade divisions, educational policies, and standards, and weld them all into a single, uniform educational system. At the same time, New York City was experiencing a huge influx of immigrants (increasing the school registers between 1900 and 1904 by 132,000 pupils), and the schools were expected to help Americanize these new students. New high schools were needed in all the boroughs and the Board of Education authorized large new buildings for Morris High School in the Bronx, DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx, Curtis High School in Staten Island, Flushing High School in Queens, and Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn.

In the interim, however, before a new building for Erasmus Hall could be constructed, the Board of Education purchased more land along Bedford Avenue near the existing building, and established classrooms in the expansion buildings that were already on the lot. They also used classrooms in other schools, such as P.S. 977, and held half-day classes.

The modern high school was designed in the Collegiate Gothic style that Snyder used on many of his buildings.

On August 17, 1904, the New York City School Board&#x27;s Committee on Buildings presented its plans for a new campus for Erasmus Hall High School. It was designed to be constructed around the existing, centrally-located buildings, so that classes could continue to be held there until the new buildings were ready. The plan called for a full quadrangle of buildings along the perimeter of the large lot. It was constructed during four periods: 1905-1906, 1909-1911, 1924-1925, and 1939-1940, with the two later buildings supervised by William H. Gompert and Eric Kebbon, respectively. Its buff brick facades have limestone and terra cotta trim and feature central entrance towers with Oriel windows and crenellated parapets, Tudor-arched entrances, label moldings, and large window groupings. The style of Erasmus Hall evolved over the years so that the most recent buildings are simpler, with less ornamentation, but retain the general characteristics of the earlier ones, giving a sense of unity to the entire composition. The first buildings would be constructed along Flatbush Avenue, with others added over time, as the need became clear and funds became available.

====Phase One====
Snyder explained his plans for the first phase as follows:
... A careful study of the matter convinced me that after all it was a good thing for the future of the school that the present one could not be disturbed, for therein lay the suggestion for a design unique in high schools of the country... A quadrangle enclosed by buildings devoted to various departments of school work.

The buildings, therefore, have been designed as a screen across the end of the quadrangle, shutting out the noise and confusion of Flatbush Avenue traffic, the only entrance being through the large arch under the tower, which is placed on the axis of the longer dimension of the plot.

This, as designed, would be called a chapel were it part of a college, but if we may not aspire to this, yet I have thought that it might be known as &#x27;the Hall.&#x27; As such the endeavor has been to design a harmonious, impressive room, in a style permeated with history and romance; a place which, of all others, will stand out clearly in the loving memory of the student in after years for his alma mater. Its walls, columns and arches should bear the trophies won in athletic and scholastic contests, there to be preserved and handed down as part of the glorious history of the school.

There have been no designs made for this elevation (Bedford Avenue), but the aim has been to have a central tower on the same axis as that on Flatbush Avenue, through the archway in the base of which will be afforded a view of the &#x27;quad&#x27; with its greensward, trees, shrubs and vines. What the ultimate design of the various buildings going to make up the group may be, it is, of course, impossible to say, but in designing and planning that portion which you now see approaching completion, I have always intended that the whole should be a graphic illustration of the various phases of the so-called Gothic movement, from the Round Arch to the Flamboyant and on through its later transitional stage.
The Committee on Buildings described the first section, estimated to cost not more than $300,000, this way:
It consists of an entrance tower which will be the center of what will afterwards be the completed front on Flatbush avenue; to the left of the tower and connected therewith has been placed the building in the rear portion of which will be the auditorium, classrooms, library, etc. The building will be three and four stories in height.

The basement will contain the gymnasium, placed beneath the auditorium, lecture rooms, baths, toilet room, etc., the boiler or power room being placed beneath the driveway of the tower, one of the turrets of which is utilized for a smoke flue.

The first floor will contain the offices of the principal of the school, two classrooms and the auditorium.

The second story will contain a library square with a gallery facing the second story of the tower, the balance of the floor being apportioned to the gallery of the auditorium, four classrooms, teacher&#x27;s rooms, toilets, etc.

The third floor will contain four classrooms, demonstration room, balance room, chemical laboratory, and lecture room.

The fourth story, which is over a portion of the building, will contain four classrooms. The completed scheme of which this is only a part contemplates the erection of a building on the northerly side of the tower for additional classrooms and laboratories, etc., as may be needed in the future.

The cornerstone for the new building was laid in January 1905 and work was begun immediately, resulting in seating for an additional 600 students. The construction contract was initially supposed to run until October 1905, but revisions required by the school board for laboratories and classrooms necessitated changes in the electrical and sanitation plans and delayed the work. The building was opened to students in September 1906.

In 1906, the committee purchased a real estate lot that was 57&#x27; 10&quot; X 138&#x27; 9&quot; X 359&#x27; 3&quot; X 7&#x27; 3&quot; X 493&#x27; 6&quot; “adjoining Erasmus Hall High School... to permit carrying out of the scheme for a building commanding a quadrangle, and will be built upon as soon as the school is in need of additional accommodations.
====Phase Two====

Although the first section of the new building brought the total students accommodated in 1906 to 1,750, by 1907 Erasmus Hall was again overcrowded, requiring the use of an annex at P.S. 42.

In his annual report, the Superintendent of Schools declared that,

The largest growth in high schools is found in Brooklyn. This growth arises not only from the natural increase in the number of pupils entering from the Brooklyn elementary schools, but also from the number of pupils entering from the Manhattan elementary schools ...The consequence is that the Brooklyn high schools are all crowded to excess.

Concerned citizens of the area wrote to the Board of Education emphasizing:

... the fact that the new building contains only twelve classrooms, accommodating only 420 pupils, whereas there are fifty-two classes, comprising 1,591 pupils, occupying classrooms in the old frame school building and cottages, all of which are utterly unfit for use.

The Superintendent&#x27;s Annual Report for 1910 reported that 3,114 pupils were enrolled at Erasmus Hall High School and that they were accommodated in four different annex buildings in addition to the main one.

In 1909, the Board of Education approved Snyder&#x27;s plans for the next section of the school. This group of three buildings, including one to the north of the tower facing Flatbush Avenue, and two extending east along the northern side of the lot, comprised 31 classrooms, laboratories, study hall, music, drawing, physics, lecture and shop rooms. When this Church Avenue addition opened in September 1911, there was room for 1,451 more students in the main school.

====Phase Three====

The ever-growing school population continued to present challenges to the school board. In his report of May 21, 1924 on construction and maintenance, the Superintendent of Schools discussed &quot;the stupendous building program now being carried on by the Board of Education...&quot; The reason for this situation was given as a backlog of not enough building over several years, as well as an increase in high school population in New York City from 20,948 students in 1904, to 109,370 in 1924. These large numbers were attributed to many factors, including the passage and enforcement of a compulsory education law and the appreciation by more parents of the advantages of higher education to their children. In April 1924, the Board of Education approved the Bedford Avenue addition to Erasmus Hall High School. Snyder had left his position with the Board of Education shortly before construction of this section, but an elevation drawing in the collection of the Art Commission, by C. B. J. Snyder shows the building essentially as built. William Gompert had been appointed in his place and supervised the construction. Although somewhat simpler than his earlier buildings, the Bedford building has a central tower with an arched passageway into the courtyard, on axis with the tower on Flatbush Avenue. The building contained many new classrooms, gymnasia and a large swimming pool along the courtyard and was opened on February 2, 1902.

A statue of Erasmus, cast from the 1622 original in Rotterdam by Hendrick de Keyser and donated by Richard Young, an alumnus of the school, was installed in the school&#x27;s courtyard. Dedicated in 1931, the base is engraved with the words: Desiderius Erasmus, the maintainer and restorer of the sciences and polite literature, the greatest man of his century, the excellent citizen who, through his immortal writings, acquired an everlasting fame.

====Phase Four====

Lobbying began in 1929 for the construction of the final section, the building on the south side of the lot connecting the Bedford Avenue building with the auditorium near Flatbush Avenue. Money was not appropriated for this until 1937, and it was finally built in 1939–40. Under the supervision of the school system&#x27;s then chief architect, Eric Kebbon, the five-story building was an even more simplified version of Snyder&#x27;s earlier work. It contained many classrooms, art and homemaking rooms, a girls&#x27; gym and a large library, and could accommodate 1,566 additional pupils. The new section opened in September 1940. To construct this building, the original frame school house had to be moved and its several wings demolished. Work on the old structure was begun by the Works Progress Administration, but was halted due to the outbreak of World War II. After the war, the relocation and restoration of the old building was completed and it was used for administrative offices.

In 1987, in celebration of the school&#x27;s bicentennial, limited archaeological excavations were conducted under the auspices of Brooklyn College. The archaeologists discovered that intact deposits from the 18th and 19th centuries associated with the development of the school are still in place.

==Closure and current status==

In 1994, after years of poor academic scores, the huge Erasmus Hall High School was divided internally into five smaller high schools, each concentrating on a different academic area. The five schools have separate administrations and faculties, and hold classes in different sections of the large building. However, they use the common lunchroom, gymnasium, library and auditorium at separate times during the day. This division created no changes on the exterior of the building.

As of 2010, separate high schools now operate on the Erasmus Hall Educational Campus:
* Academy for College Preparation and Career Exploration: A College Board School (K382)
* Academy of Hospitality and Tourism (K408)
* High School for Service &amp; Learning at Erasmus (K539)
* High School for Youth and Community Development at Erasmus (K537)
* Science, Technology and Research Early College High School/Middle School at Erasmus (K543)

===Restorations===
In 2011, the columns that supported the building were found to have structural problems, and that year, the building received a restoration. A 2019 report states that &quot;the building still needs more love but in 2017 Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams pledged $650,000 of the capital budget for exterior restoration&quot;.

<text>Johann Palisa (6 December 1848 – 2 May 1925) was an Austrian astronomer, born in Troppau, Austrian Silesia, now Czech Republic. He was a prolific discoverer of asteroids, discovering 122 in all, from 136 Austria in 1874 to 1073 Gellivara in 1923. Some of his notable discoveries include 153 Hilda, 216 Kleopatra, 243 Ida, 253 Mathilde, 324 Bamberga, and the near-Earth asteroid 719 Albert. Palisa made his discoveries without the aid of photography, and he remains the most successful visual (non-photographic) asteroid discoverer of all time. He was awarded the Valz Prize from the French Academy of Sciences in 1906. The asteroid 914 Palisana, discovered by Max Wolf in 1919, and the lunar crater &quot;Palisa&quot; were named in his honour.

== Biography ==
Palisa was born on 6 December 1848, in Troppau in Austrian Silesia (now called &quot;Opava&quot; and located in the Czech Republic). From 1866 to 1870, Palisa studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of Vienna; however, he did not graduate until 1884. Despite this, by 1870 he was an assistant at the university&#x27;s observatory, and a year later gained a position at the observatory in Geneva. A few years later, in 1872, at the age of 24, Palisa became the director of the Austrian Naval Observatory in Pula. While at Pula, he discovered his first asteroid, 136 Austria, on 18 March 1874. Along with this, he discovered twenty-seven minor planets and one comet. During his stay in Pula he used a small six-inch refractor telescope to aid in his research.

Palisa became director of the Pula observatory, with the rank of commander, until 1880. In 1880 Palisa moved to the new Vienna Observatory. While at the observatory he discovered 94 comets by visual means.

In 1883 he joined a French expedition to Caroline Island to observe the Solar eclipse of 6 May 1883. During the expedition, he joined to observations for the search for the hypothetical planet Vulcan, as well as collecting samples of insects for the Vienna Museum of Natural History. In memory of this expedition, he named the asteroid 235 Carolina after Caroline Island.

In 1885, Palisa offered to sell the naming rights of some of the minor planets he discovered, in order to fund his travels to observe the Solar eclipse of 29 August 1886. However he sold just a small number of these naming rights and apparently did not go.

Palisa and Max Wolf worked together to create the first star atlas created by photographic plates, the Palisa–Wolf Sternkarten, also known as the Palisa-Wolf-Star-Maps, published in 1899, 1902, 1908. In 1908, Palisa published the Sternenlexikon, mapping the skies from declinations −1° to +19°. That same year, he became the vice director of the Vienna Observatory. He retired from administrative duties in 1919, but kept observation rights. Palisa continued to discover asteroids until 1923. He died on 2 May 1925.

== Discoveries ==
Between 1874 and 1923 Palisa discovered 122 asteroids ranging from 136 Austria to 1073 Gellivara and the much later numbered Mars-crosser 14309 Defoy, respectively &quot;(see table below)&quot;. He made his discoveries at the Austrian Naval Observatory at Pola and at the Vienna Observatory. He also discovered the parabolic comet C/1879 Q1 in August 1879.

One of his discoveries was 253 Mathilde, a 50-kilometer sized C-type asteroid in the intermediate asteroid belt, which was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft on 27 June 1997. The robotic probe passed within 1200 km of Mathilde at 12:56 UT at 9.93 km/s, returning imaging and other instrument data including over 500 images which covered 60% of Mathilde&#x27;s surface. Only a small number of minor planets have been visited by spacecraft.

Palisa made all of his asteroid discoveries visually. Even though Max Wolf had revolutionised the process of asteroid discovery by introducing photography in the 1890s, Palisa continued to trust on visual observations. His final discovery, 1073 Gellivara, was the last asteroid that was found visually. Johann Palisa remains the most successful visual (non-photographic) asteroid discoverer of all time.

It should also take 73 years after the last asteroid discovery of 1073 Gellivara until the next minor planet 9097 Davidschlag was discovered by Austrian amateur astronomers .





==Family==
Palisa married his second wife, Anna Benda, in 1902. Asteroid 734 Benda is named after her. He also named minor planets after other members of his family: 320 Katharina after his mother, Katherina, 321 Florentina for his daughter Florentine.

His granddaughter was Gertrud Rheden, wife of astronomer Joseph Rheden. Asteroid 710 Gertrud is named after her.

== Honors and awards ==

In 1876 Palisa was awarded the Lalande Prize.
Palisa was awarded the Valz Prize from the French Academy of Sciences in 1906.

The Phocaea main-belt asteroid 914 Palisana, discovered by Max Wolf in 1919, and the lunar crater &quot;Palisa&quot; were named in his honour.
Minor planets 902 Probitas, 975 Perseverantia, and 996 Hilaritas that he discovered were given names after his death for traits qualities associated with him: adherence to the highest principles and ideals, perseverance and happy or contented mind. Names were given by Joseph Rheden with the support of Palisa&#x27;s second wife, Anna.

Minor planet 1152 Pawona is named after both Johann Palisa and Max Wolf, in recognition of their cooperation. The name was proposed by Swedish astronomer Bror Ansgar Asplind. &quot;Pawona&quot; is a combination of &quot;Palisa&quot; and &quot;Wolf&quot; (Pa, Wo) joined with a Latin feminine suffix.

<doc id="583499" wikidata="Q1699314" url="?curid=583499" title="John O. Bennett">
<text>John Orus Bennett III (born August 6, 1948) is an American former politician from New Jersey. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a state senator, and between 2002 and 2004, as president of the state senate. Bennett served as acting governor of New Jersey for four days in January 2002.

==Education==
Bennett attended Dickinson College from 1966 to 1968, graduated from West Virginia University with a B.A. in 1970, and earned a J.D. from Seton Hall University School of Law in 1974.

==Acting governor==
Bennett acted as governor for three and a half days in January 2002. Following Republican Governor Christine Todd Whitman&#x27;s resignation on January 31, 2001 to become head of the EPA, Bennett was one of three different senate presidents (along with Donald DiFrancesco and Richard Codey, and furthermore Attorney General John Farmer Jr.) to serve as acting governor for the one-year period between Whitman&#x27;s resignation and the inauguration of the Democratic governor-elect Jim McGreevey on January 15, 2002.

Fellow Republican DiFrancesco served as acting governor for almost a year in his capacity as president of the senate, but his term as president ended a few days before the rest of the gubernatorial term was finished, as a new senate had been sworn in. The new senate was evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, leading Attorney General Farmer to serve as acting governor for about ninety minutes while Republican leader Bennett and Democratic leader Codey agreed to serve as co-presidents of the senate. They also decided to divide the last week of the gubernatorial term among them, with Bennett first serving for three and a half days, from January 8, 2002 to January 12, 2002, before Codey would serve the remaining three and a half days. By the time McGreevey took office on January 15, he was the fifth person to serve as governor in the preceding eight days.

During his service as acting governor, Bennett signed legislation into law, appointed judges, granted a pardon to Hugh G. Gallagher, created a nursing advisory council, and hosted several parties at Drumthwacket. The nursing advisory council was a tribute to his wife, Peg, a nurse.

Before he became Senate President, Bennett served as Senate Majority Leader.

==Controversies==
In June 2002, Bennett was involved in a shoving match with South Jersey Democratic Party boss and Commerce National Insurance CEO George Norcross after Norcross threatened to publicize a pardon Bennett gave during his three-day executive tenure if Bennett could not convince his fellow Republican senators to vote for a tax increase and stadium construction bill in committee.

Bennett fell out of favor as a result of allegations that he overbilled the municipality of Marlboro Township for legal services. In a statement to the press, Bennett blamed party bosses and a biased press for attempting to destroy him. Bennett was a leading opponent of using state funds to construct a convention center/stadium in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey that would have been used by a minor league ice hockey team in which Norcross had bought an interest.

==2003 Election==
John Bennett failed in his 2003 bid for re-election to the State Senate, falling to Ellen Karcher, 52%-43%, with the Green Party of New Jersey candidate winning 5% of the vote.

==Current activities==
In the 2005 primary election he was elected Republican State Committeeman for Monmouth County. John O. Bennett is also a professor at Montclair State University. In June 2012 he was elected the chairman of the Monmouth County Republican Party Committee during its annual reorganization meeting. After being ousted from the chairmanship by county sheriff Shaun Golden, Bennett served as an administrator for Oceanport, Lavallette, and Woodbridge.

In September 2020, he was appointed as the Interim Administrator in Dover, New Jersey. His appointment was made permanent in April 2021.

== Personal life ==
Bennett was hospitalized in January 2022 after a traffic accident with a school bus. The crash may have been caused by a medical incident.

<text>Daryl Melham (born 26 November 1954) is an Australian former politician. He was a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives representing the Division of Banks in New South Wales from 1990 to 2013.

==Early life and education==
Melham was born in Sydney, to a family of Lebanese descent and studied law and economics at the University of Sydney, earning an LL.B. and a B.Ec.

==Career==

===Legal career===
Melham was a barrister and solicitor and a public defender before entering politics. He was vice-president of the New South Wales Labor Party from 1999 until 2002.

Melham worked as a solicitor with the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, specialising in criminal law from 1979 to 1987. He was subsequently admitted to the bar as a barrister, and was a public defender until his entry into federal politics in 1990. He is also a foundation member of the NSW Society of Labor Lawyers.

Melham is a Life Member and has served as President of the Revesby Workers&#x27; Club.

===Political career===
Elected to Parliament in 1990, Melham entered the Opposition Shadow Ministry following Labor&#x27;s electoral defeat in 1996. He served as Shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs but resigned in 2000 after a policy disagreement with the then Labor leader Kim Beazley. He returned to the Opposition Shadow Ministry in 2001 and he was Shadow Minister for Housing, Urban Development and Local Government from December 2003, resigning from the front bench soon after the Labor Party&#x27;s election defeat in October 2004.

Melham and colleague Lindsay Tanner were the only Labor MPs to openly speak out against the Howard government&#x27;s proposed anti-terrorism legislation which provides for harsher punishments for sedition and grants police new shoot-to-kill powers. Melham also spoke out against the Howard government&#x27;s changes to the rules concerning political donations, which allowed donations of up to 10,000 to be given to political parties without public disclosure. Melham was quoted as saying in May 2006: &quot;We&#x27;re going to have the best politicians money can buy, but we won&#x27;t see [how much]&quot;.

Melham resigned as the Federal Labor caucus chair on 30 October 2012. Following the 2010 election, Melham&#x27;s usually high margin in Banks was reduced to a low 1.5%. He lost the seat at the 2013 federal election against the Liberal candidate, David Coleman.

<doc id="583508" wikidata="Q955973" url="?curid=583508" title="Pearl-spotted owlet">
<text>The pearl-spotted owlet (Glaucidium perlatum) is a small bird of prey found in sub-Saharan Africa. They belong to the Strigidae family, otherwise known as the typical owls or the true owls, which contains most species of owl. As part of the genus &quot;Glaucidium,&quot; or pygmy owls&quot;,&quot; they are commonly referred to as &#x27;owlets&#x27; due to their diminutive size. Pearl-spotted owlets are brownish and heavily spotted white, with two distinct black false &#x27;eyes&#x27; at the back of their head. They are often confused with an African barred owlet.

==Description==
The pearl-spotted owlet is one of the smallest owls in Africa with a length of 17 to 21 cm. The females are slightly larger and heavier (100g) than the males (65g). Both males and females have similar plumage colouration. The facial disc is off-white and the eyes are yellow. At the back of the head there are two striking false black &#x27;eyes&#x27; with a white outline. The upper parts are cinnamon-brown with white spots. The tail and flight feathers are brown, with large white spots forming bars in flight. The bill and cere are pale greenish yellow, the legs are feathered white and feet are yellow. Juveniles are similar to adults but the head and back spots may be lacking or much reduced and the false &#x27;face&#x27; is very obvious.

Pearl-spotted owlets are often confused with African barred owlets, which have finely barred (not spotted) head and back, a blotched (not streaked) breast, barring across the upper breast, lack the false &#x27;eyes&#x27;, and have a proportionally large head.

=== Vocalisation ===
Pearl-spotted owlets call by day and night, especially before breeding, but are quiet when nesting. They have a distinct call: a loud series of shrill, short whistles that accelerate in tempo and rise in volume to a crescendo of long, loud whistles that descend in pitch and volume, &quot;peu peu peu-peu-peu peeuu peeeuu.&quot; A breeding pair may call in duet, whereby the female is higher pitched. In alarm, pair members give soft whistles and peeps.

==Distribution and subspecies==
The pearl-spotted owlet occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly widespread across savanna, in southern Africa, across north and central Namibia, south to southern limit of arid bushveld and woodland in south Namibia. Their occurrence continues further north through Botswana and Zimbabwe up to Sudan and west to Senegal.

They occur in a wide range of woodland and bushveld habitats, especially mopane and open thorn savanna with areas of sparse ground cover. They avoid dense woodland and forest, and open grassland and shrubland.

Currently, there are three recognised subspecies throughout Africa:

*&quot;Glaucidium perlatum perlatum&quot; — Senegal and Gambia to western Sudan
*&quot;Glaucidium perlatum licua&quot; — Eastern Sudan and Ethiopia to northern South Africa, Angola and Namibia
*&quot;Glaucidium perlatum diurnum&quot; — Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique

The pearl-spotted owlet has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion of the IUCN. The population trend appears to be stable, and although the population size has not been quantified, it is not believed to be of concern. For these reasons the pearl-spotted owlet is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Behaviour==
The pearl-spotted owlet is often active by day, but hunts and calls mostly at night. They roost in relatively open sites below canopies of small bushes or shrubs, staring intently at intruders and readily changing perches if disturbed. When alarmed they will often flick or wag their tail feathers. They are seen bathing regularly by day when open water is available. Their flight is fast and undulating with whirring wings.

===Foraging and food===
They hunt mostly at night from a low perch, taking prey from the ground below, but sometimes swooping to snatch it from foliage, off nests or in flight. They hunt opportunistically by day, often being mobbed by small birds. They flick their tail feathers when excited while hunting, or bob the head up and down. Pearl-spotted owlets predominantly eat arthropods — especially grasshoppers, crickets, and solifuges — but are capable of hunting small vertebrates such as rodents, bats, lizards, snakes and small birds.

Although the pearl-spotted owlet is not a threat to larger vertebrates, the capture and killing of pearl-spotted owlets by Red colobus in western Uganda as an anti-predator behaviour has been observed.

===Breeding===
Pearl-spotted owlets are monogamous, solitary nesters, and highly territorial. The density of nesting in lightly wooded habitat is limited by nest-hole availability. The male takes food to the female as a courtship display and the female spends long periods calling softly from within the nest before laying. Their nests are usually old holes excavated by large barbets or woodpeckers. A single female has been observed to use the same nest site for at least 4 years. Females usually have from 2 to 4 eggs with an incubation period around 29 days.

<doc id="583514" wikidata="Q44317" url="?curid=583514" title="Automatic terminal information service">
<text>Automatic terminal information service, or ATIS, is a continuous broadcast of recorded aeronautical information in busier terminal areas. ATIS broadcasts contain essential information, such as current weather information, active runways, available approaches, and any other information required by the pilots, such as important NOTAMs. Pilots usually listen to an available ATIS broadcast before contacting the local control unit, which reduces the controllers&#x27; workload and relieves frequency congestion. ATIS was developed and adopted by the FAA in the mid-1960s and internationally (under the direction of ICAO) beginning in 1974. Before the adoption of ATIS, this information was routinely disseminated to each aircraft separately, increasing controller workload during periods of high traffic density.

In the U.S., ATIS will include (in this order): the airport or facility name; a phonetic letter code; time of the latest weather observation in UTC; weather information, consisting of wind direction and velocity, visibility, obstructions to vision, sky condition, temperature, dew point, altimeter setting, density altitude advisory if appropriate; and other pertinent remarks, including runway in use. If it exists, the weather observation includes remarks of lightning, cumulonimbus, and towering cumulus clouds. Additionally, ATIS may contain man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) alert and advisory, reported unauthorized laser illumination events, instrument or visual approaches in use, departure runways, taxiway closures, new or temporary changes to runway length, runway condition and codes, other optional information, and advisories.

The recording is updated in fixed intervals or when there is a significant change in the information, such as a change in the active runway. It is given a letter designation (alpha, bravo, charlie, etc.) from the ICAO spelling alphabet. The letter progresses through the alphabet with every update and starts at &quot;alpha&quot; after a break in service of twelve hours or more. When contacting the local control unit, pilots indicate their &quot;information &lt;letter&gt;&quot;, where &lt;letter&gt; is the ATIS identification letter of the ATIS transmission the pilot received. This helps the ATC controller verify that the pilot has current information.

Many airports also employ the use of data-link ATIS (D-ATIS, introduced in 1996). D-ATIS is a text-based, digitally transmitted version of the ATIS audio broadcast. It is accessed via a data link service such as the ACARS and displayed on an electronic display in the aircraft. D-ATIS is incorporated on the aircraft as part of its electronic system, such as an EFB or an FMS. D-ATIS may be incorporated into the core ATIS system or be realized as a separate system with a data interface between voice ATIS and D-ATIS.

The ATIS is not to be confused with the METAR, which will not contain certain information such as the runway in use.

==Sample messages==

See METAR for a more in-depth explanation of aviation weather messages and terminology.

===Example 2===
This example was recorded on 11 July 2016 at London Stansted Airport during which time there were ongoing maintenance works taking place on the taxiway surface in a part of the airport near the cargo terminal; the ATIS broadcast reflects this.

<text>Judith Eleanor Moylan (born 24 February 1944) is a former Australian politician. She served in the House of Representatives from 1993 to 2013, representing the Western Australian seat of Pearce for the Liberal Party. She served as Minister for Family Services (1996–1997) and Minister for the Status of Women (1997–1998) in the early years of Howard government and was known for her liberal views.

==Early life==
Moylan was born on 24 February 1944 in Guildford, Western Australia. She completed a diploma in real estate management at Perth Technical College. She obtained a real estate licence in 1979 and subsequently established her own real estate business. Moylan was also a TAFE coordinator and lecturer from 1984 to 1987. She was president of the Midland and Districts Chamber of Commerce from 1990 to 1991.

==Politics==
Moylan was first elected to parliament at the 1993 federal election. She was the first woman to hold a WA seat in the House of Representatives for the Liberal Party. She was a supporter of John Hewson in the 1994 leadership spill, in which Hewson was defeated by Alexander Downer. She was subsequently appointed to Downer&#x27;s shadow ministry as the shadow small business minister.

Following the Coalition&#x27;s victory at the 1996 federal election, Moylan was appointed Minister for Family Services in the Howard government. She was moved to the status of women portfolio in October 1997 and dropped from the ministry after the 1998 election. In November 1997 she appeared in a television advertising supporting a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the republic referendum, alongside other Liberal ministers Amanda Vanstone and John Fahey.

Moylan was a leading member of the Liberal Party&#x27;s &quot;small-l liberal&quot; wing, which made her stand out in an increasingly conservative party. In June 2005 she joined a backbench revolt led by Liberal colleague Petro Georgiou in an attempt to end the system of mandatory detention in Australia of asylum seekers. On 28 July 2011, she announced she would stand down at the next federal election.

<text>The Dorset was a Paleo-Eskimo culture, lasting from to between and , that followed the Pre-Dorset and preceded the Thule people (proto-Inuit) in the North American Arctic. The culture and people are named after Cape Dorset (now Kinngait) in Nunavut, Canada, where the first evidence of its existence was found. The culture has been defined as having four phases due to the distinct differences in the technologies relating to hunting and tool making. Artifacts include distinctive triangular end-blades, oil lamps (qulliq) made of soapstone, and burins.

The Dorset were first identified as a separate culture in 1925. The Dorset appear to have been extinct by 1500 at the latest and perhaps as early as 1000. The Thule people, who began migrating east from Alaska in the 11th century, ended up spreading through the lands previously inhabited by the Dorset. It is not fully known whether the Inuit and Dorset ever met. Some modern genetic studies show the Dorset population were distinct from later groups and that &quot;There was virtually no evidence of genetic or cultural interaction between the Dorset and the Thule peoples.&quot; However, the question of why the Dorset disappeared so completely has led some to suggest that Thule invaders wiped out the Dorset people in &quot;an example of prehistoric genocide.&quot;

Inuit legends recount them encountering people they called the  (in syllabics: ᑐᓃᑦ, singular ᑐᓂᖅ ). According to legend, the first inhabitants were giants, taller and stronger than the Inuit but afraid to interact and &quot;easily put to flight&quot;.

==Discovery==
In 1925, anthropologist Diamond Jenness received artifacts from Cape Dorset, now Kinngait. As they were quite different from those of the Inuit, he speculated that they were indicative of an ancient, preceding culture. Jenness named the culture &quot;Dorset&quot; after the location of the find. These artifacts showed a consistent and distinct cultural pattern that included sophisticated art distinct from that of the Inuit. For example, the carvings featured uniquely large hairstyles for women, and figures of both sexes wearing hoodless parkas with large, tall collars. Much research since then has revealed many details of the Dorset people and their culture.

==History==
===Origins===
The origins of the Dorset people are not well understood. They may have developed from the previous cultures of Pre-Dorset, Saqqaq or (less likely) Independence I. There are, however, problems with this theory: these earlier cultures had bow and arrow technology which the Dorsets lacked. Possibly, due to a shift from terrestrial to aquatic hunting, the bow and arrow became lost to the Dorset. Another piece of technology that is missing from the Dorset are drills: there are no drill holes in Dorset artifacts. Instead, the Dorset gouged lenticular holes. For example, bone needles have long, narrow holes that were painstakingly carved or gouged. Both the Pre-Dorset and Thule (Inuit) had drills.

===Historical and cultural periods===

Dorset culture and history is divided into periods: the early (), middle (), and late phases (), as well as perhaps a terminal phase (from onwards). The terminal phase, if it existed, would likely be closely related to the onset of the Medieval Warm Period, which started to warm the Arctic considerably around the mid-10th century. With the warmer climates, the sea ice became less predictable and was isolated from the High Arctic.

The Dorset were highly adapted to living in a very cold climate, and much of their food is thought to have been from hunting sea mammals that breathe through holes in the ice. The massive decline in sea-ice which the Medieval Warm Period produced would have strongly affected the Dorset. They could have followed the ice north. Most of the evidence suggests that they disappeared some time between 1000 and 1500. Radiocarbon dating has shown the Dorset were living in the Cambridge Bay area as late as 1350 CE, while the Thule Inuit moved into the area around 1200 CE. Scientists have suggested that they disappeared because they were unable to adapt to climate change or that they were vulnerable to newly introduced disease.

==Technology==

The Dorset adaptation was different from that of the whaling-based Thule Inuit. Unlike the Inuit, they rarely hunted land animals, such as polar bears and caribou. They did not use bows or arrows. Instead, they seem to have relied on seals and other sea mammals that they apparently hunted from holes in the ice. Their clothing must have been adapted to the extreme conditions.

Triangular end-blades and burins are diagnostic of the Dorset. The end-blades were hafted onto harpoon heads. They primarily used the harpoons to hunt seal, but also hunted larger sea mammals such as walrus and narwhals. They made lamps, called qulliq, from soapstone and filled them with seal oil. Burins were a type of stone flake with a chisel-like edge. They were probably either used for engraving or for carving wood or bone. Burins were also used by Pre-Dorset groups and had a distinctive mitten shape.

The Dorset were highly skilled at making refined miniature carvings, and striking masks. Both indicate an active shamanistic tradition. The Dorset culture was remarkably homogeneous across the Canadian Arctic, but there were some important variations which have been noted in both Greenland and Newfoundland / Labrador regions.

==Interaction with Inuit==
There appears to be no genetic connection between the Dorset and the Thule who replaced them. Archaeological and legendary evidence is often thought to support some cultural contact, but this has been questioned. The Dorset people, for instance, engaged in seal-hole hunting, a method which requires several steps and includes the use of dogs. The Thule apparently did not use this technique in the time they had previously spent in Alaska. Settlement pattern data has been used to claim that the Dorset also extensively used a breathing-hole sealing technique and perhaps they would have taught this to the Inuit. But this has been questioned on the grounds that there is no evidence that the Dorset had dogs.

Some Inuit elders describe peace with an ancient group of people, while others describe conflict.

===Sadlermiut===
Scholars had thought that the Sadlermiut, a people living in near isolation mainly on and around Coats Island, Walrus Island, and Southampton Island in Hudson Bay up until 1902–03, might have been the last remnants of the Dorset culture, as they had a culture and dialect distinct from the mainland Inuit. Encounters with Europeans and exposure to infectious disease caused the deaths of the last members of the Sadlermiut.

A 2002 paper suggested that the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Sadlermiut people was related to that of both the Dorset and Thule peoples, perhaps suggesting local admixture.

A subsequent 2012 genetic analysis, however, showed no genetic link between the Sadlermiut and the Dorset.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;Science&quot; in August 2014 examined the remains of nineteen Dorset people buried in Canada and Greenland between c. and . The sixteen samples of mtDNA extracted were determined to belong to haplogroup D2a1 (twelve samples), D2a (three samples) and D. These haplogroups also predominate in the preceding Saqqaq culture, suggesting genetic continuity between the two. The authors of the study suggested that the ancestors of the Saqqaq and Dorset entered North America from Siberia in a single distinct migration about , after which they remained genetically largely isolated for thousands of years. The Dorset were genetically distinct from the Thule people who, after expanding out of Siberia, completely replaced the Dorset people around . The study also found no evidence of genetic mixing between Dorset people and the Greenlandic Norse people.

<doc id="583520" wikidata="Q6249871" url="?curid=583520" title="John Murphy (Australian politician, born 1950)">
<text>John Paul Murphy (born 31 May 1950) is an Australian former politician who served as an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from October 1998 until September 2013, representing Lowe and then Reid, New South Wales.

==Early life and education==
John Murphy was born in Dunedoo, New South Wales. He was educated at Waverley College in NSW and worked with the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs for 20 years before moving to the Merit Protection Review Agency for eight years, including six years as Manager. Murphy served as a Councillor on Drummoyne Council (now part of Canada Bay Council) from 1995 to 1998.

==Political career==
Murphy gained pre-selection for the ALP over the high-profile Michael Costello, former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Australian Stock Exchange, following protests by local ALP members who did not want Costello (who lived outside the electorate) being imposed on them.

Lowe&#x27;s previous MP was Paul Zammit, a Liberal who turned Independent in protest over the Howard Government&#x27;s policies on aircraft noise. Standing as an independent in the 1998 election, Zammit&#x27;s preferences flowed to Murphy to help him win the seat for Labor. Murphy retained his seat at every subsequent election until 2013.

Murphy was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Minister for Health Stephen Smith from December 2001 to February 2003 and then Parliamentary Secretary to federal Labor leaders Simon Crean, Mark Latham, Kim Beazley and Kevin Rudd from February 2003 to December 2007. When Rudd become Prime Minister, Murphy became the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade. He left this position, citing family reasons, in a ministerial reshuffle which occurred on 19 February 2009.

Following an electoral redistribution in 2009, Murphy&#x27;s electorate was renamed Reid following significant changes to its boundaries. On 4 December 2009, he was preselected unopposed as Labor&#x27;s candidate for the federal electorate of Reid.

Murphy narrowly retained Reid in 2010 with a swing of 11% swing against him. However, he was defeated in 2013 by Liberal candidate Craig Laundy on a 2.7% swing.

==Views==
He is a member of the NSW Right and holds socially conservative views on most moral issues, such as abortion and stem-cell research. Murphy campaigned against the Howard Government&#x27;s removal of cross-media ownership restrictions and has been a long-standing critic of media proprietors, such as Rupert Murdoch and the late Kerry Packer. He has also campaigned against any expansion of Sydney Airport and once told the House of Representatives that the Chairman of Sydney Airport, Max Moore-Wilton, &quot;should be flogged&quot; for his failure to act on aircraft noise which is a major issue in his electorate of Lowe.

During his term in Parliament, Murphy expressed strong views opposing same-sex marriage in Australia. In an interview on 27 August 2011, Murphy claimed that his electorate he had a large number of Christian and Islamic voters and that granting permission to homosexuals and lesbians to marry was &quot;a step too far&quot;. The interview sparked further debate on the topic within Labor.

<text>Grigory Nikolayevich Neujmin (; – 17 December 1946) was a Georgian–Russian astronomer, native of Tbilisi in Georgia, and a discoverer of numerous minor planets as well as 6 periodic and a hyperbolic comet at the Pulkovo and Simeiz Observatories during the first half of the 20th century.

== Discoveries ==

The Minor Planet Center credits his discoveries under the name &quot;G. N. Neujmin&quot;, and his surname appears this way in the literature. However, the modern English transliteration of his name would be Neuymin.

Neujmin is credited with the discovery of 74 asteroids, and notably 951 Gaspra and 762 Pulcova.

He also discovered and co-discovered 6 Jupiter-family comets, namely 25D/Neujmin, 28P/Neujmin, 42P/Neujmin, 57P/du Toit-Neujmin-Delporte (including fragment A) and 58P/Jackson–Neujmin, as well as C/1914 M1 (Neujmin), a hyperbolic comet.

== Awards and honors ==

He received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour on 10 June 1945. The lunar crater &quot;Neujmin&quot; is named in his honour, as is 1129 Neujmina, a main-belt asteroid of the Eos family discovered by Praskovjya Parkhomenko at Simeiz Observatory in 1929.

<text>Gary Roy Nairn (3 January 1951 – 1 June 2024) was an Australian politician.

== Early life ==
Nairn was born in Sydney on 3 January 1951, and was educated at Sydney Boys High School from 1963 to 1968 before attending University of New South Wales. He was a surveyor in private practice and managing director of a surveying and mapping consultancy before entering politics. He moved to the Northern Territory where he lived for many years. He was the President of the Country Liberal Party between 1990 and 1994, during which time the CLP won two elections with an increased vote.

== Federal political career ==
Nairn returned to New South Wales and in March 1996, was elected a Liberal Party of Australia member of the Australian House of Representatives, representing the seat of Eden-Monaro.

In 2003, he headed a federal inquiry into the 2003 Canberra bushfires. He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister John Howard in October 2004. In January 2006, he was promoted to the front bench as Special Minister of State which included responsibilities with Ministerial and Parliamentary Services, the Australian Government Information Management Office, Australian Electoral Commission, Defence Housing Authority, and Film Australia. He served in Howard&#x27;s outer ministry.

Nairn&#x27;s hold on Eden-Monaro was always rather tenuous. Since the late 1960s, it had been a noted bellwether seat; it had been held by the party of government without interruption since 1972. For most of that time, the seat has been highly marginal. Even in the midst of a massive swing to the Coalition in 2004, for instance, Nairn only managed a swing of 0.4 percent.

In the 2007 federal election, Nairn lost his seat to Labor candidate Mike Kelly. Nairn was one of five members of the Howard ministry to lose their seats at the election. Howard also lost his own seat of Bennelong.

== Phelps-Kelly controversy ==
In September 2007, Nairn&#x27;s chief of staff, Peter Phelps, engaged in a heated verbal exchange with the Labor Party candidate for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly at a forum on the Iraq War in Queanbeyan, New South Wales. At the meeting Phelps claimed that Mike Kelly was a hypocrite as a former soldier running for the ALP when they are opposed to the war in Iraq. Phelps stated at the meeting that he thought Kelly was using the Nuremberg defence, and compared it to the kind of defence used by guards at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Nairn did not agree with his staffer&#x27;s sentiments.

== National Spatial Action Agenda, ANZLIC and SIBA ==
During his time in Parliament, Nairn worked closely with Warwick Watkins who was the Chairman of ANZLIC, the Australian New Zealand Land Information Council (also known as the Spatial Information Council) to advocate federal government support for the National Spatial Action Agenda and other related initiatives including the Australian Spatial Consortium (ASC) and the Cooperative Research Centre, CRC for Spatial Information (CRC-SI). Further, Nairn worked closely with the Australian Spatial Information Business Association (ASIBA), which later changed its name to the Spatial Information Business Association (SIBA), to support the agenda. 
Nairn advocated the Agenda to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet and was supported by ASIBA and ANZLIC throughout. Arising from these efforts, Warren Entsch, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, launched the establishment of a steering group to drive the Spatial Information Industry Action Agenda in November 2000.

The Action Agenda was released in September 2001. Under the Spatial Information Industry Action Agenda, on 25 September 2001, then Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Nick Minchin announced a $2 million Grant to a consortium of private &quot;spatial firms&quot; to increase the effectiveness of spatial information. ASIBA was identified as the industry body to lead most of the responsibility under the action agenda. Minchin also identified the key intergovernmental roles of ANZLIC under the Action Agenda. Nairn continued his support for the agenda until he lost his federal seat in November 2007 election. Thereafter, he remained engaged through ASIBA/SIBA. In 2012, Nairn was appointed the Chair of SIBA.

Nairn, in his role as Special Minister of State, announced the establishment of ASC, with initial membership including ANZLIC, ASIBA and CRC-SI. Watkins was designated as Chairman of the ASC Steering Committee. ASC was reported as being established “to accelerate the unlocking of the potential of spatial information for economic, environmental and social benefit for Australia within key industries, and the development of tools, new technologies and capabilities relating to the fundamental future needs of the nation.” The actual role and achievements, if any of ASC, remain vague.

Under the National Spatial Information Industry Action Agenda, the CRC-SI was established in 2003 and launched by Nairn after significant advocacy by ANZLIC led by Watkins and also ASIBA. In its 2011-12 Annual Report (page 12), CRC-SI reported that Watkins, a Director of CRC-SI since inception, had resigned from the CRC-SI Board following his retirement from the NSW Public Service. The CRC-SI reporting was false as Watkins was officially sacked by the NSW government.

== Centre for Spatial Data Infrastructures and Land Administration (CSDILA), University of Melbourne ==
Nairn chaired the CSDILA Advisory Committee until his death.

== Other ==
From 2018 to 2024, Nairn was the Chairman of The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s International Award of Australia where he oversaw major restructuring and record growth in the use of the Duke of Edinburgh in Australia.

== Personal life and death ==
Nairn was married to Rose. His first wife, Kerrie, died from cancer in 2005. They had two children.

Nairn died from cancer in Queensland, on 1 June 2024, aged 73.

<doc id="583530" wikidata="Q839524" url="?curid=583530" title="Spotted owlet">
<text>The spotted owlet (Athene brama) is a small owl which breeds in tropical Asia from North Pakistan to Southeast Asia. A common resident of open habitats including farmland and human habitation, it has adapted to living in cities. They roost in small groups in the hollows of trees or in cavities in rocks and buildings. It nests in a hole in a tree or building, laying 3–5 eggs. The species shows great variation including clinal variation in size and forms a superspecies with the very similar little owl.

==Description==

The spotted owlet is a small and stocky bird, barely in size. The upperparts are grey-brown, heavily spotted with white. The underparts are white, streaked with brown. The facial disc is pale and the iris is yellow. There is a white neckband and supercilium. Sexes are similar. The flight is deeply undulating. The nominate form is darker than the paler forms such as &quot;indica&quot; of drier regions.

==Taxonomy==
Early workers sometimes treated members of this species group as subspecies of &quot;Athene noctua&quot;. The two have been separated but they are considered to form a superspecies complex. Several subspecies have been described and about four or five are widely accepted (the race &quot;poikila&quot; is invalid and refers to &quot;Aegolius funereus&quot;; &quot;A. b. fryi&quot; of southern India described by Stuart Baker and &quot;A. b. mayri&quot; described by Deignan from northern Thailand are not usually recognized.) The five widely recognized subspecies are &quot;albida&quot; Koelz, 1950 of western Asia in Iran and Pakistan; &quot;indica&quot; (Franklin, 1831) of northern India; &quot;brama&quot; (Temminck, 1821) of southern India which is darker than &quot;indica&quot;; &quot;ultra&quot; Ripley, 1948 (not always recognized) of northeastern India is said to have white spots on the mantle and &quot;higher pitched calls&quot;; and &quot;pulchra&quot; Hume, 1873 of Southeast Asia from Myanmar and Thailand extending into Cambodia and Vietnam. The northern and southern Indian populations intergrade and there is no dividing boundary. The northern &quot;indica&quot; populations have the upperparts brownish. Size decreases from north to south. The species is not found in Sri Lanka, although birds on the Indian mainland are found even at the tip of Rameshwaram.

==Ecology==
===Behavior===

This species is nocturnal but is often seen during the day. When disturbed from their daytime site, they bob their head and stare at intruders. Their presence can often be located by the small birds that mob the owlets while they are perching in a tree during daytime.The call is a harsh and loud churring and chuckling &#x27; ending with a &#x27; and they call mainly during early dawn or just after sunset.
The brain has a pineal gland, formerly thought to be absent in the owls. Birds show variation in the melatonin concentration between day and night. A high melatonin level is associated with sleep and low levels are associated with high alertness and foraging activity. Spotted owlets, however, show only a slightly lower melatonin concentration at night with a slight increase in the early afternoon. Other owls such as the barn owl show little day-night variation. Seasonal changes in glandular activity have been associated with environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.

===Feeding===
They hunt a variety of insects and small vertebrates. In Pakistan they have been found to take mostly insect prey. In the arid region of Jodhpur, they have been found to take more rodents (especially in the genus &quot;Mus&quot; and tend to avoid other rodents such as &quot;Tatera&quot;) prior to the breeding season. Bats, toads, small snakes such as &quot;Ramphotyphlops braminus&quot; have been noted. They may also take scorpions and molluscs. Nests near human habitations may show higher breeding success due to the increased availability of rodents for feeding young.

===Breeding===

The breeding season is November to April. Courtship behaviour includes bill grasping, allopreening and ritual feeding. The female may call with the male, bob head and deflect its tail in invitation. The social organization of family groups is not clear and multiple males may copulate with a female and females may attempt pseudocopulation, possibly a kind of displacement behaviour. They nest in cavities often competing with other hole-nesters such as mynas, rollers and parakeets. They may also nest in holes in vertical embankments. The nest may be lined with leaves and feathers or may use the existing lining from a prior occupant. The typical clutch is made up of three or four spherical white eggs (30.9mm long and 26.3 mm wide, 11.6g) and incubation begins with the first laid eggs leading to a wide variation in the size of the chicks. The young are fed initially on insects such as cockroaches and later fed small vertebrate prey such as mice (a toad &quot;Bufo stomaticus&quot; has been noted in Gujarat). The chicks gain weight during the early stages but lose weight before fledging. Only one or two chicks may fledge and they leave the nest in about a month.

===Parasites===

A coccidian parasite, &quot;Eimeria atheni&quot;, has been described from this species. An ectoparasitic mite, &quot;Neocheletiella athene&quot;, has been described from a specimen from the Antwerp zoo. Bird lice of the species &quot;Colpocephalum pectinatum&quot; are known to be ectoparasites. The Acanthocephalan parasite &quot;Apororhynchus chauhani&quot; was discovered in the intestine of the spotted owlet.
==In culture==
These birds, being very familiar to humans especially with their loud calling, have been associated with bad omens. The species name &quot;brama&quot; is from the French name &quot;Chouette brame&quot; and indirectly refers to this owl&#x27;s Indian habitat by way of homage to Brahma, the Hindu supreme spirit.

<doc id="583532" wikidata="Q5508778" url="?curid=583532" title="Function type">
<text>In computer science and mathematical logic, a function type (or arrow type or exponential) is the type of a variable or parameter to which a function has or can be assigned, or an argument or result type of a higher-order function taking or returning a function.

A function type depends on the type of the parameters and the result type of the function (it, or more accurately the unapplied type constructor codice_1, is a higher-kinded type). In theoretical settings and programming languages where functions are defined in curried form, such as the simply typed lambda calculus, a function type depends on exactly two types, the domain &quot;A&quot; and the range &quot;B&quot;. Here a function type is often denoted , following mathematical convention, or , based on there existing exactly (exponentially many) set-theoretic functions mappings &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; in the category of sets. The class of such maps or functions is called the exponential object. The act of currying makes the function type adjoint to the product type; this is explored in detail in the article on currying.

The function type can be considered to be a special case of the dependent product type, which among other properties, encompasses the idea of a polymorphic function.

== Programming languages ==
The syntax used for function types in several programming languages can be summarized, including an example type signature for the higher-order function composition function:
When looking at the example type signature of, for example C#, the type of the function is actually codice_2.

Due to type erasure in C++11&#x27;s codice_3, it is more common to use templates for higher order function parameters and type inference (codice_4) for closures.

== Denotational semantics ==
The function type in programming languages does not correspond to the space of all set-theoretic functions. Given the countably infinite type of natural numbers as the domain and the booleans as range, then there are an uncountably infinite number (2ℵ0 = c) of set-theoretic functions between them. Clearly this space of functions is larger than the number of functions that can be defined in any programming language, as there exist only countably many programs (a program being a finite sequence of a finite number of symbols) and one of the set-theoretic functions effectively solves the halting problem.

Denotational semantics concerns itself with finding more appropriate models (called domains) to model programming language concepts such as function types. It turns out that restricting expression to the set of computable functions is not sufficient either if the programming language allows writing non-terminating computations (which is the case if the programming language is Turing complete). Expression must be restricted to the so-called &quot;continuous functions&quot; (corresponding to continuity in the Scott topology, not continuity in the real analytical sense). Even then, the set of continuous function contains the &quot;parallel-or&quot; function, which cannot be correctly defined in all programming languages.

<text>The Numismatist (formerly Numismatist) is the monthly publication of the American Numismatic Association. &quot;The Numismatist&quot; contains articles written on such topics as coins, tokens, medals, paper money, and stock certificates. All members of the American Numismatic Association receive the publication as part of their membership benefits.

==History==
The inaugural issue was a four-page leaflet originally published in 1888 by collector Dr. George F. Heath in Monroe, Michigan, as &quot;The American Numismatist,&quot; in which he listed coins he wanted to purchase, advertised duplicates for sale, and discussed various topics. The name was changed to &quot;The Numismatist&quot; soon after. The name was purchased by the American Numismatic Association many years later when the organization began to print a monthly publication for the benefit of its members.

In December 2015, the ANA announced it had digitized every issue of the magazine.

In April 2020, longtime editor Barbara J. Gregory retired after 32 years as editor-in-chief and 39 years on the staff. She was succeeded in the position by Caleb Noel, who, at age 29, became the youngest editor-in-chief in the magazine&#x27;s history. Under his leadership, the magazine premiered a redesign in October 2023.

<text>William Does His Bit is the 23rd book of children&#x27;s short stories in the Just William series by Richmal Crompton.

This book contains 10 stories. It was first published in 1941, and the first published versions are now collectors&#x27; items and relatively rare.

Like its immediate predecessors and the next two installments this book contains the central theme of World War II and the war effort, which was being fought at the date of this book&#x27;s original publication.

== Plot ==

===William Does His Bit===
William hears the family talk about a man called Quisling (William calls him &#x27;Grisling&#x27;), who apparently appears to exist in many places at once, helping the Germans. When he learns the man is in fact many men doing the same thing, he sets out to find Quisling and capture him. His search takes him to the village, where at an intersection, two elderly ladies are talking about passwords in whispers. William at once decides to follow the second one, who goes to a school building through the cover of laurel bushes and at a blackened window, William sees an elderly gentleman with many women talking and putting flags on maps. He, believing it to be Grissel&#x27;s gang plotting propaganda after he hears them make calls about disasters, follows the man to his house, and when he starts mowing his lawn, he rings the police asking them to come, due to stories where the hero is captured but the police come in the nick of time. William is caught &quot;stealing&quot; plates and cutlery so he can see where Grissel&#x27;s papers are. The police start to arrest him, as William talks about the man and his doing. The man dismisses the police, rewarding William for his &quot;efforts to the country&quot; with money, a bun and lemonade. William walks home contentedly and tells his mother what happened. His mother does not believe him, and continues sewing.

===William The Highwayman===
William decides that he and Ginger should become highwaymen to steal some money to account for money that was lost by them, and by William&#x27;s bike being removed because he trampled flowers over with it. William and Ginger dress up as what they think highwaymen look like. Their first attempts are useless, but then they steal a man&#x27;s briefcase, believing it to be full of treasure. It turns out it is full of rocks. Ethel is starting a rockery, and William sells them to her for six pennies. A gentleman visits who happens to be the girl&#x27;s relation, and says that highwaymen held up his car. William is found out, but all ends well when he sees a movie about highwaymen with the gentleman.

===Boys Will Be Boys===
The Brown family is getting stressed out at William&#x27;s presence. They decide he must be given to one of his relations for a while to keep. William at first is indignant about being kept by his aunt, then he discovers the village she lives in isn&#x27;t so dull after all... Two elderly gentleman, a colonel and another man find themselves bickering like they did the year before, and the one before that and so on, about their prizes. One breeds good asparagus, and one good peaches. Both vow to win the other&#x27;s best offerings and grow those plants. William gets most mixed up in the happenings, accidentally wrecking their plants, which finally causes the contest to be called off that year, and decides after his adventures with them, not to be too detailed to his mother about what happened.

===William The Fire Man===
The outlaws, who often frequent the Village and Marley, notice that a fire &quot;station&quot; has been built out of an old garage. The outlaws watch in awe, as &quot;god like beings&quot; walk in &quot;thigh high boots&quot; carrying hoses and dripping in endless water. At first, the gang of schoolboys find themselves merely waiting on the outside and watching the amazing happenings. Then, they dare to venture in. The men even find their company nice for a while, until William&#x27;s band decide to join. That&#x27;s where it all goes wrong. The officer of the area, Mr Perkins, decides that schoolboys shouldn&#x27;t be parading with his men, and turn them out. But William is not finished yet. His band make their OWN fire squad area next to the garage in a spot of unused land that waits for them conveniently. When Perkins uses a new tactic to get them away, after he is shot in the face by one of the outlaws with a hose, he says he will talk to their fathers. William finds a fire, however after a while, but it is in PERKINS house! When the section officer finds out, William is reluctantly rewarded.

===William Makes A Corner===
The household bustles with the sounds of the words &quot;war&quot; and &quot;economy&quot;, most often joining to form &quot;war economy&quot;. William, trying in vain to persuade his mother that leaving school would save money, and that he would go back after the war (historical note, book was written in 1941, meaning the war would end in about 4 years, William being eleven). He asks the cook if she knew about war economy. Aside from stealing the odd couple of raisins (which later ended in a comical sequence of the Brown&#x27;s saying how few raisins were in their raisin puddings), he manages to get Cook to tell him about &quot;corners&quot; of produce made by &quot;war profiteers&quot; who gain money from wars. William decides to make a &quot;corner&quot; of wood, since there is a wood nearby his home. He takes it to the house of a Builder, and finds a scared women there, fretting over her war time recipes, which happen to include directions that don&#x27;t even make sense to her. She tells William to put his &quot;wood corner&quot; in the living room. But it is not Mr. Jones the builder who lives here, rather Mr. Jones the fretwork creator!!! Obviously taking a &quot;wood corner&quot; to be a piece of a chair or something, she hurriedly assumes William has every right to dump his barrow into the living room. The woman&#x27;s relations have been skipping from place to place, eventually bleeding all their relations dry, and Mrs. Jones is no different. When William outrages Mr. Jones with his &quot;corner&quot; of sticks and twig sized branches of common firewood, Mrs. Jones is however quite glad to see them leave for another unfortunate relation! She eventually gives William a Stilton Cheese to take to Mr. Brown.

===William the Parachutist===
William and the outlaws see Home Guard men, one of which being a local blacksmith, doing their job practising &quot;shooting through holes&quot; and so forth, and wish they could do something similar. The outlaws build a fortress, made of sandbags and boxes, even equipped with &#x27;little holes&#x27; to shoot their toy weapons through. One night, a man in a &quot;woman&#x27;s dress&quot; whom they think is a parachutist walks along the road they blockaded. The outlaws shoot at him and accidentally knock him out when the barricade falls over. They find a pass to Marleigh Aerodrome on him, so get someone to run to the police. When the policeman is there, the &quot;parachutist&quot; explains he is dressed as a woman because he is in a play that night, he forgives William and lets him see the play at Marleigh Aerodrome. William and the outlaws have the happiest day they have had in their lives so far.

===William the Salvage Collector===
William hears at an air raid shelter that scrap iron should be collected more, as a local woman and her daughter have joined them this evening. After the &quot;all clear signal&quot;, William goes to bed and dreams of Hitler in a woman&#x27;s suit pushing a barrow with Ethel – Ethel having a cork in her mouth. When he wakes up, he decides he must do something about collecting scrap iron. The outlaws put letters into people&#x27;s mailboxes, asking for &quot;skrappion&quot; and the results are varied. Some are amused, and some annoyed, saying they can&#x27;t &quot;play games&quot; with them. After William finds some scrap iron he carries his cart to the next house. And what a surprise he gets there. He finds the Bevertons exhibition of war memorabilia, even though he thinks it is simply scrap iron. And he has every right to be pleased at what he finds... who wouldn&#x27;t like to look for junk only to find parts of Dorniers!!! However, the Bevertons, when they find out, are not nearly as impressed. And the fact that William leaves his old junk on the exhibition table, leading to the guests believing it to be a plot to gain cash revenues, does not lessen the spirit of anger.

===William Helps The Spitfire Fund===
William, his consciousness nagging him about ruining the Bevertons Spitfire fundraising exhibition decides to raise funds himself by having a war memorabilia exhibition museum himself. The only item he manages to find is a sign a practical joker must have put on the ground saying &quot;unexploded bomb&quot;. His museum had no visitors, so it failed. Meanwhile, after hours of nagging Mrs. Bott to give her land up for allotments to a &quot;good cause&quot;, The Dig For Victory committee leaves angrily as she brandishes herself about in the air of one who is utterly annoyed. When she sees the signpost saying &quot;unexploded bomb&quot; in front of her mansion, she runs to the Brown&#x27;s for cover. William and the Outlaws had had to leave it there after their arms would just not lift again, and so left it there they did. &quot;Botty&quot;s wife signs the paper saying she will give up allotments saying it was a sign she must do it. When William takes it away and the Browns don&#x27;t see it, she says it was a vision telling her to sell her land. She gives William three pounds for the Spitfire Fund in hope that she will receive further good luck accounts.

===William Gets A Move On===
William, inspired to do something good for the war cause, sees two men pulling up road signs, and tells them it would be better to turn them the other way, so Germans would get lost. This gives him an idea, when he sees two houses, with identical nameplates with different names attached, and he gets his screwdriver and fixes the plate &#x27;laurel bank&#x27; on the house &#x27;heather bank&#x27; and vice versa. When he gets home, Robert asks him if he passed Laurel bank, as he admires a blonde young girl named Dulcie who lives there. When the owners of the two houses who once were good friends, but separated after a dispute when one said gardens should be reserved for vegetables and one said the same, but for flowers to keep up the country pride, they send for gardeners to burn all the flowers in the vegetable grower&#x27;s yard, and all the vegetables in the flower growers yard. But when there (Colonel Peabody and Mr. Bagshott) gardeners find the name plates on the wrong houses, they dig up each growers pride and joy. Each owner, when seeing Robert doing the digging, after suggesting he do the rest to a tired gardener, (after all, when Dulcie saw his rippling muscles working away...) blames first Robert, then the other for the gardener&#x27;s digging. They end up making up to each other, and Robert and Dulcie meet for the first time. When Robert finds out of William&#x27;s doings he doesn&#x27;t mind.

===Claude Finds a Companion===

When the outlaws hear from William that sweet production has stopped during the remainder of the war, they decide to make their own sweets and sell them to the shops and eat them themselves. Each boy races through their mother&#x27;s larder and bring back an odd array. Included are a tin of sardines and a some coconut pieces. They mix it all together to create &quot;sardine toffee&quot; and taste it, with the following results. First tastiness, second a lasting flavour, third a green countenance! One by one they leave until only William and Ginger remain. When William casually mentions the cakes and sweets they would receive at the party they were attending that evening, Ginger goes too. But, William, never one to say &#x27;I surrender&#x27; in any case of the like, goes bravely, yet worriedly, to the party. At Mrs Bott&#x27;s place, where the party will be held, a woman has come to seek one of the children who appears most earnest, to take home to be a companion to her son, Claude. Claude, it turns out, is a bully, even larger than William, and by his mother&#x27;s standards after all, (she is writing books on child psychology) he should play with a meeker child, so the meeker one would become braver and more manly, and the manly one (meaning Claude) would become more meek. If she had known William&#x27;s usual look when he hadn&#x27;t eaten a sweet made of sardines, she may not have been so inclined to take him. But, she didn&#x27;t. So, she took him. And, when Claude expects another babyish child to pummel at his own will (the father and gardener and housemaid were told not to interfere with proceedings, so not to disturb the balance as Claude&#x27;s mother said, so unfortunately they watched a poor child being left to the manly strength of Claude) found that William was not his regular punch bag, but a more manly person. When Mrs Brown expects William to come home changed, she gets a full surprise. William, not only unchanged but invigorated, walks in!

<doc id="583543" wikidata="Q1048418" url="?curid=583543" title="JetLite">
<text>JetLite was a low-cost subsidiary of Jet Airways. It was formerly known as &quot;Air Sahara&quot; until the buyout by Jet Airways which rebranded the airline as JetLite. On 17 April 2019, JetLite grounded all of its flights and ceased all operations, in tandem with its parent company, Jet Airways.

==History==
===Foundation===
The airline was established on 20 September 1991 and began operations on 3 December 1993 with two Boeing 737–200 aircraft as Sahara India Airlines, as part of the major Sahara India Pariwar business conglomerate. Initially, services were primarily concentrated in the northern sectors of India, keeping Delhi as its base, and then operations were extended to cover all the country. Sahara India Airlines was rebranded as Air Sahara on 2 October 2000, although Sahara India Airlines remains the carrier&#x27;s registered name. On 22 March 2004 it became an international carrier with the start of flights from Chennai to Colombo, later expanding to London, Singapore, Maldives and Kathmandu. It had also planned to become the first private Indian carrier to serve China with flights to Guangzhou from winter 2006, however, this did not materialize. The uncertainty over the airline&#x27;s fate caused its share of the domestic Indian air transport market to go down from approximately 11% in January 2006 to a reported 8.5% in April 2007.

===Buyout by Jet Airways===
Jet Airways announced its first takeover attempt on 19 January 2006, offering US$500 million (₹20 billion) in cash for the airline. Market reaction to the deal was mixed, with many analysts suggesting that Jet Airways was paying too much for Air Sahara. The Indian Civil Aviation Ministry gave approval in principle, but the deal was eventually called off over disagreements over price and the appointment of Jet chairman Naresh Goyal to the Air Sahara board. Following the failure of the deal, the companies filed lawsuits seeking damages from each other

A second, eventually successful attempt was made on 12 April 2007 with Jet Airways agreeing to pay ₹14.50 billion ($340 million). The deal gave Jet a combined domestic market share of about 32%.

On 16 April Jet Airways announced that Air Sahara will be renamed as Jetlite. The takeover was officially completed on 20 April, when Jet Airways paid ₹4 billion.

===Rebranding to JetKonnect===
Jetlite was merged with Jet Airways&#x27; in-house low-cost brand JetKonnect on 25 March 2012 as a move towards operating under one brand.
On 1 December 2014 JetKonnect was integrated into Jet Airways ending its own operations and now flew for them under the codeshare, using its own Air Operators Certificate and flight code S2 till the merger of the two companies was completed after approval. The aircraft fleet was also progressively being repainted in Jet Airways livery.

===End of Operations===
On 17 April 2019, JetLite grounded all of its flights and ceased all operations, in tandem with its parent company, Jet Airways, which also grounded all of its flights and ceased all operations on the same day.

==Services==
JetLite had an extensive domestic network, as well as international services to Nepal and Sri Lanka that were dropped after the merger with JetKonnect, focusing only on domestic routes.

A buy onboard menu called JetCafé with food for purchase was offered in Economy, while free meals were offered in Business class.

==Corporate Affairs==

===Business Trends===
The key trends for Jet Lite (India) Limited (&#x27;Jet Lite&#x27;) over recent years are shown below (as at year ending 31 March):

<text>Brendan John Nelson (born 19 August 1958) is an Australian business leader, physician and former politician. He served as the federal Leader of the Opposition from 2007 to 2008, going on to serve as Australia&#x27;s senior diplomat to the European Union and NATO. He currently serves in a global leadership role with Boeing.

A medical doctor by profession, he came to public prominence as the Federal President of the Australian Medical Association (1993–95), and served as a Minister in the third and fourth terms of the Howard government, serving as Minister for Education, Science and Training (2001–06) and Minister for Defence (2006–2007).

Nelson was a member of the House of Representatives from 1996 to 2009, as the Liberal member for the Division of Bradfield in northern Sydney.

Following the 2007 federal election, at which the Howard government was defeated, Nelson was elected leader of the Liberal Party in a contest against former Minister for Environment and Water Resources Malcolm Turnbull, and became the Leader of the Opposition on 3 December 2007. On 16 September 2008, in a second contest following a spill motion, Nelson lost the leadership of the Opposition and the Liberal Party to Turnbull.

Nelson retired from politics in 2009, and was Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg, the European Union and NATO from 2009 to 2012. He was then Director of the Australian War Memorial from 2012 to 2019, subsequently serving as its chair until the end of 2022.

In February 2020, Nelson was made the President of Boeing Australia, New Zealand, and South Pacific. In September 2022, it was announced he would move to London to become President of Boeing International.

==Early life==
Nelson was born in Coburg, a suburb of Melbourne, as the eldest of three children of Des Nelson, a marine chief steward active in the Seamen&#x27;s Union, and his wife, Patricia. In his infancy, his family moved to his mother&#x27;s home town of Launceston, Tasmania.

In his early teenage years, the Nelson family relocated again to Adelaide, South Australia, where he matriculated at Saint Ignatius&#x27; College before going on to study economics at the University of Adelaide. However, he dropped out in his first year, working in various casual jobs in retail and hospitality before returning to university to study medicine. He switched to Flinders University to complete his Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS).

==Medical career==

===General practice career===

Nelson then relocated to Hobart, Tasmania, taking up practice as a medical practitioner from 1985 until 1995. In 1986, he married for a second time, and became a father to twins. In 1987, he and David Crean, brother of Labor politician Simon Crean and later a Tasmanian state Labor minister, established an after-hours locum service which he worked in until 1991.

===President of the Australian Medical Association===
In 1988, Nelson joined the Australian Medical Association, and in 1990 became the Tasmanian State president of the organisation, taking a reformist approach to the role, and assisted the State branch in growing its membership. In 1991, he replaced Michael Jones, a former AMA president from Western Australia, as federal AMA vice-president. He took a strong public stand against sponsorship of sports events by cigarette companies, lobbying politicians directly for legislative change, and also encouraged airlines to increase the number of non-smoking seats.

On 30 May 1993, Nelson was elected unopposed as federal president of the Australian Medical Association, at 34 being the youngest ever holder of the office. He came to the office after significant hostility between the AMA and the federal Labor government, which peaked at the 1993 election under former AMA president Bruce Shepherd and former Health Minister Brian Howe. Nelson attempted to establish better relations with the government and its new Health Minister, Graham Richardson. He pledged to make Aboriginal health and the effects of unemployment on health a high priority during his term as federal president, and would appoint a full-time worker based in Canberra to look after these issues.

In an address to the National Press Club on 30 September 1993, acknowledging the AMA&#x27;s reputation for conservatism, he said he would not &quot;lead the AMA safely&quot;, but believed doctors should &quot;lead the way in showing that national progress can be made by placing the welfare and consideration of other human beings ahead of their own,&quot; asserting their obligation to speak out on issues for the public good. In the address, he advocated gay law reform, greater concern for the environment, more attention to Aboriginal and unemployed health, and greater co-operation between the medical profession and politicians of all sides to build a better health system. In November, he told a national Aboriginal conference in Sydney that he was ashamed of the medical profession&#x27;s track record on Aboriginal health, arguing that &quot;doctors need to ask themselves how a person can be well when they&#x27;ve been denied their land, their hunting grounds, their citizenship and freedom and even their own children. Of course Aboriginal people&#x27;s health has suffered when you look at this litany of misery&quot;. As president, while personally opposing euthanasia, he supported the right of doctors to withdraw treatment from consenting critically ill patients, and supported euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke&#x27;s case against the Royal Darwin Hospital.

The role of private health in the health care mix, Aboriginal health, the AMA&#x27;s ongoing campaign against cigarette sponsorship of sports events, and the size of the Medicare levy were other significant issues which occupied a lot of Nelson&#x27;s time and attention as federal president, as they did the various Ministers for Health in the final years of the Keating government. Nelson took ministers and shadow ministers around Central Australia to view Aboriginal communities. In October 1994, the World Conference on Tobacco and Health in Paris unanimously adopted an AMA resolution calling for a formal United Nations strategy on tobacco control.

==Political career==

=== Early involvement with the Australian Labor Party ===
Nelson&#x27;s father&#x27;s strong involvement in the union movement and the Australian Labor Party influenced his early political development, and he joined Labor at the age of 13. However, he resigned from the Labor Party in 1991 before accepting a role on the AMA executive, on account of his perception of it as an apolitical position.

At a rowdy pre-election rally during the 1993 election campaign in Toorak, as vice-president of the AMA, he declared via a megaphone that &quot;I have never voted Liberal in my life!&quot; On 25 November 1993, he told journalist and medical writer Steve Dow that Labor governments generally were better for Australia but not always in their handling of health care.

=== Early political career ===
In January 1994, Nelson joined the Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party of Australia. After initially being tipped for the South Australian seat of Boothby, being vacated by outgoing Liberal MP Steele Hall, he sold his Tasmanian home, and moved to Lindfield in the affluent North Shore region of Sydney, establishing a surgery at The Rocks and switching his membership to the Pymble branch. On 30 January 1995, he announced his nomination for the preselection contest for Bradfield, a safe Liberal seat in which Pymble was located and held since 1974 by shadow minister David Connolly. The seat had been in Liberal hands for its entire existence, and the Liberals held it with a 27-percent majority, making it the safest Coalition seat in Sydney and one of the safest Coalition seats in metropolitan Australia. He was supported in his bid by former AMA president Bruce Shepherd, who served as his campaign treasurer. On 1 March 1995, at a Liberal gathering, he renounced his view that Labor governments had been better for Australia, and stated that he believed Medicare was unsustainable and that voluntary work programs for the unemployed would build self-esteem, and advocated a consumption tax. He also declared that he intended to be a high-profile member of Parliament, saying &quot;if all I wanted to do was be a parliamentarian, a seat-warmer, I would have gone for a marginal seat.&quot; A bitter preselection campaign ensued; and, on 13 May 1995, he gained the party&#x27;s endorsement on a 96-to-93 vote, even though Connolly had the support of Liberal leader John Howard and deputy leader Peter Costello. Nelson claimed his win was &quot;a victory for liberalism&quot;.

After the preselection, Nelson worked on an Aboriginal health program for the Cape York Peninsula; and, in June, following his retirement as president of the AMA, went to the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, on behalf of World Vision to hear about that country&#x27;s struggles with AIDS, three months after losing his younger brother to the disease.

On 14 July 1995, as master of ceremonies for a fundraising dinner supporting Howard, he was criticised for his risque humour concerning then-current entertainment and political events, not having realised that Lady Fairfax, Lady McMahon, and conservative business leaders were in the audience. The incident attracted considerable publicity and there were calls from inside the Liberal Party to reverse his preselection, but he was supported by key decision-makers including the president of the NSW Liberal Party.

===Member for Bradfield (1996–2009)===

Nelson was elected to Parliament as expected at the federal election on 2 March 1996, at which the Keating government was defeated and John Howard became Prime Minister. Although he suffered a tiny swing against him, he still took 64.7 percent of the primary vote and 75.8 percent after preferences were distributed. Nelson spent his first two terms as a government backbencher, while establishing himself as a leading member of the moderate, or &quot;small-l liberal,&quot; wing of the Liberal Party.

Nelson was a vocal opponent of the views of Independent MP Pauline Hanson following her maiden speech on 10 September 1996, challenging her to visit Palm Island and other Aboriginal communities with him. On 6 October, he proposed a bipartisan condemnation of her statements along lines already suggested by Labor Opposition leader Kim Beazley, saying that politicians had an obligation to show leadership on the issue. He questioned the Prime Minister, who offered to cooperate and negotiate, but indicated he would not support the Opposition&#x27;s motion in full. On 19 October, Nelson said he believed the Government needed to more clearly repudiate Hanson&#x27;s claims, and that she was &quot;appealing to a primeval instinct&quot; in her statements on Aboriginals and Asian migrants. On 30 October 1996, a bipartisan motion on tolerance, nondiscriminatory immigration and Aboriginal reconciliation was moved and passed.

In December 1996, Liberal MP Kevin Andrews raised a private members&#x27; bill to overturn the Northern Territory&#x27;s euthanasia legislation, which had been championed by Dr Philip Nitschke. Nelson, along with former New South Wales premier John Fahey, were accused of convincing the son of the first man to die under the law, who had previously been a euthanasia advocate, to change his mind. The man, a branch secretary of a rural Liberal branch, ended up in hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown following the publicity surrounding the matter. When the bill went through the House of Representatives on 10 December, Nelson was one of 88 MPs who voted for Andrews&#x27; bill on a conscience vote. Nelson also had to apologise to Parliament in March 1997 when it was found that 11 parts of a speech he had given matched a paper on overseas doctors by immigration expert Bob Birrell of Monash University published the previous year.

Nelson was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence in 2001. In this role he directed the Mulwala ammunition factory to be decontaminated and decommissioned.

===Minister for Education, Science and Training (2001–2006)===
After the 2001 federal election he was promoted directly to Cabinet with the senior portfolio of Minister for Education, Science and Training. Despite Bradfield&#x27;s long-standing status as a comfortably safe Liberal seat, Nelson was the first person to be promoted to cabinet while holding the seat.

He introduced a series of radical changes to Australia&#x27;s higher education system that simultaneously imposed more direct government control over the management of universities while also allowing them to earn more revenue by charging higher fees to students. He extended the government&#x27;s policy of directing more federal funding to non-government schools, as well as becoming more involved in reviewing the state education systems. In 2005 he introduced Voluntary Student Unionism. He was a popular target for student activism because of these changes.

Nelson announced in August 2004 that public schools &quot;must have a functioning flagpole, fly the Australian flag and display the values framework in a prominent place in the school.&quot;

In 2005 Nelson expressed support for giving parents the option of having students exposed to the controversial subject of intelligent design. However he emphasised that evolution should always hold first place saying, &quot;I&#x27;d be quite concerned if intelligent design were to replace evolution.&quot; He later said intelligent design should only be taught in religion or philosophy classes.

===Minister for Defence (2006–2007)===

After his rapid promotion to Cabinet, Nelson was spoken of as a possible future Liberal leader. On 24 January 2006, then Prime Minister John Howard announced Nelson&#x27;s promotion from the Education, Science and Training portfolio to the high profile Defence portfolio.

As Defence Minister, he made the controversial decision to purchase Boeing&#x27;s Super Hornet aircraft instead of a fighter perceived by some to be more capable.
===Leader of the Opposition (2007–2008)===
Following the defeat of the Howard government at the 2007 federal election, he was elected Liberal party leader and therefore Leader of the Opposition, narrowly defeating Malcolm Turnbull in a 45 to 42 vote, after the withdrawal from the race of Tony Abbott. After Nelson&#x27;s election, his political past resurfaced, with him claiming he came from a Labor family.

Nelson became the first person since Billy Snedden in 1972 to become Opposition Leader without prior experience in Opposition. Nelson also became the first Catholic to lead the Liberal Party.

Nelson was elected Liberal leader on 29 November, four days before the commission of the Howard government and hence his appointment as Defence Minister was terminated. This meant that technically he was both Liberal leader and Defence Minister in those four days.

On 1 December 2007 Nelson attempted to distance himself from some of the conservative policies of his predecessor, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t support gay marriage, adoption or IVF. But I believe in addressing the social and economic injustices affecting homosexuals.&quot;

Nelson declared that the Liberal Party had &quot;listened and learned&quot; from the Australian public on WorkChoices. He pronounced the program &quot;dead,&quot; vowing it would never be resurrected as part of Coalition policy, and called on the Government to move quickly to introduce draft industrial relations legislation.
In January 2008, Nelson opposed making any formal apology to the Indigenous Australians known as the &quot;Stolen Generations&quot;. Nelson said such an apology would fuel guilt among middle Australia, and cause a mentality of &quot;victimhood&quot; among indigenous Australians. In early February 2008, Nelson changed his stance, and declared that he supported the apology, first personally, then also on behalf of his party:
I, on behalf of the Coalition, of the alternative government of Australia, are [sic] providing in-principle support for the offer of an apology to the forcibly removed generations of Aboriginal children.

When a motion formally apologising to the Stolen Generations was put before the House on 13 February, Nelson voted in favour, as did all Coalition members present in the chamber. However, seven members of Nelson&#x27;s caucus—Peter Dutton, Don Randall, Sophie Mirabella, Dennis Jensen, Wilson Tuckey, Luke Simpkins and Alby Schultz—were absent. Before the vote, Nelson delivered a 20-minute speech endorsing the apology. Nelson&#x27;s endorsement triggered nationwide protests; several people watching the speech booed, jeered and turned their backs on him.

Nelson&#x27;s leadership came under increased pressure in January 2008, after an MP shifted loyalties to Turnbull, and taking into consideration that former MP Dave Tollner had been allowed to vote in the initial contest, the leadership vote would now be deadlocked at 43–43. Newspoll polling in February 2008 set a record low &quot;Preferred Prime Minister&quot; rating for any opposition leader at 9 percent, with March polling setting another record of 7 percent, with two-party-preferred setting another Newspoll record at 37–63 percent. Nelson responded by declaring himself the underdog. In response to increased speculation about his leadership Nelson commented in April that he &quot;will keep fighting and standing up for everyday Australians.&quot;.

Nelson used his 2008 budget reply to declare the Rudd government budget a &quot;tax and spend&quot; budget, as well as arguing for a 5-cent reduction in petrol excise, and pledging to block an increase in the &quot;alcopop&quot; tax.

In May 2008, Nelson gave his approval to a merger occurring between the Queensland Liberal Party and Queensland National Party.

Support for Nelson as leader within the Liberal Party had all but collapsed by the end of July 2008, in part due to repeated gaffes on emissions trading and climate change. Expected to challenge him was either Peter Costello or Malcolm Turnbull, upon the release of Costello&#x27;s book, &quot;The Costello Memoirs&quot;. Costello stated he would not be making any move for the Liberal leadership, however media outlets capitalised on Costello&#x27;s failure to categorically rule out any future leadership challenge.

Nelson suffered from another gaffe in August 2008, where he stated:

Peter&#x27;s made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party. As I&#x27;ve said before, I&#x27;d be very happy if he changes his mind.

He later attempted to clarify the comment in that he was referring to Costello staying in parliament.

Despite a small and steady increase after record low polling, Nelson lost the leadership of the Liberal Party to Shadow Treasurer, Malcolm Turnbull, on 16 September 2008 by 45 to 41 votes in a spill. Nelson went to the backbench.

Turnbull and later Liberal leader Tony Abbott eventually became prime ministers and meant that so far Nelson is the only Liberal leader of the 21st century who did not become prime minister.

===Resignation from politics===
On 16 February 2009, Nelson announced that he would retire from politics at the next federal election. On 25 August 2009, he announced that he would resign from Parliament in late September 2009. Nearly two months later, Nelson officially resigned on 19 October 2009, triggering the 2009 Bradfield by-election. He maintains an interest in Australian political life, recently speaking at a Liberal Party event in honour of Australia&#x27;s first Indigenous Parliamentarian, Senator Neville Bonner.

==Post-political career==
===Diplomatic appointments===
On 17 September 2009, Foreign Minister Stephen Smith appointed Nelson as the Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg, the European Union, and NATO, at the same time appointing former Federal Labor Leader Kim Beazley as the Australian Ambassador to the United States. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the appointments in Canberra the same day. Nelson accepted the appointment from his former rival and commended the decision to appoint Beazley as Ambassador to the US. Nelson said of both appointments, they &quot;would be accepted across the political spectrum.&quot;

===Director of the Australian War Memorial===
On 23 August 2012, the government announced Nelson&#x27;s forthcoming appointment in the Australian Public Service as the new Director of the Australian War Memorial effective from 17 December 2012, succeeding Major General Steve Gower. In August 2019, Nelson announced that after seven years he would be stepping down as head of the Australian War Memorial.

===Business appointments===
In February 2020, Nelson became the president of Boeing Australia. In December 2022, it was announced that effective January 12, 2023, Nelson would serve as the head of Boeing&#x27;s international division.

==Personal life==
Nelson is married to Gillian, whom he married in 1999, raising her daughter together. He was previously married to Kate, a nurse. They married in 1983, were together 15 years, raising their twins, a son and daughter. Whilst a student, he had been briefly married to his childhood sweetheart, Deanna.

In 1995, his brother, Philip, died after a long battle with AIDS.

Nelson&#x27;s hobbies include playing guitar and riding motorcycles, a habit he began at 17 when he dropped out of an economics degree at the University of Adelaide and needed a cheap form of transport.

In 2016 Nelson was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in recognition for his distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, to the community, to the advancement of Australia&#x27;s international relations, and to major cultural institutions.

<text>Paul Christopher Neville (20 March 1940 – 1 January 2019) was an Australian politician who was a National Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1993 to August 2013, representing the Division of Hinkler, Queensland. After the Queensland chapters of the Nationals and Liberals merged in 2008 as the Liberal National Party of Queensland, Neville continued to sit with the Nationals in Parliament.

==Biography==
Neville was born in Warwick, Queensland, and was a theatre supervisor, Queensland State Secretary, Arts Council of Australia and manager of the Bundaberg District Tourism and Development Board before entering politics. He was National Party Whip from 1998 until his retirement in 2013.

Credit for preserving the Parliament House centenary flag has been given to Neville who on 18 September 2001 during the Centenary of Federation requested of the Speaker that &quot;before it [the flag] becomes too faded or too tattered, [it] be taken down and perhaps offered to a museum or an art gallery as the seminal flag that flew over this building 100 years from the time the first flag was flown?&quot; It has subsequently been paraded at schools to mark Australian National Flag Day on a tour of the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Queensland.

Neville, a long-time resident of Limpus Crescent, Kalkie died at the Bundaberg Base Hospital, aged 78 in the early hours of 1 January 2019 after suffering health problems for some time. He and his wife Margaret were the parents of five children.

It was announced on Australia Day 2019 Neville had been posthumously awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in recognition of his dedication to the Bundaberg community. It is unclear who nominated Neville for the prestigious award; however, to meet prerequisites it is indicated that he must have been nominated prior to his death on 1 January 2019.

<text>Michelle Anne O&#x27;Byrne (born 6 March 1968) is an Australian politician for the Australian Labor Party and since May 2024, the Speaker of the Tasmanian House of Assembly.

O&#x27;Byrne was elected in the 2006 state election to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in the division of Bass.

In the 2024 Tasmanian state election, O&#x27;Byrne was the second most successful candidate across the state for the Labor Party, receiving 0.95 quotas in her own right in the first preferences alone, only outdone by then-leader, Rebecca White.

Prior to her election to state parliament she was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1998 to 2004, representing the Division of Bass.

==Early life==

O&#x27;Byrne was born in Launceston, Tasmania, a grand-niece of a former Labor senator and President of the Senate, Justin O&#x27;Byrne. She graduated from the University of Tasmania in 1992, with a Bachelor of Arts in General Studies. She was an organiser for the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union, and electorate officer to Senator Kerry O&#x27;Brien before entering politics.

==Federal MP for Bass==

She won the federal seat of Bass in 1998, and again in 2001, but was defeated by her Liberal opponent Michael Ferguson in the 2004 election.

Many put this down to concern about loss of forestry jobs under Labor&#x27;s environment policy, which had the potential to adversely affect O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s electorate.

==State MP for Bass==

After more than a year out of politics, O&#x27;Byrne ran as a Labor candidate in the 2006 state election and was easily elected for the state seat of Bass, which covers the same territory as the federal seat. She topped the poll in the five-member electorate, receiving 23.3% of first preferences, helping ensure that Bass was the only seat to record a swing to Labor.

Until the defeat of the Labor government in the 2014 state election, she served in the Tasmanian cabinet as Minister for Health, Children and Sport &amp; Recreation. She served in cabinet with her brother David O&#x27;Byrne, one of a very few pairs of siblings to have served in cabinet together anywhere in the world.

Prior to the 2010 election, O&#x27;Byrne was Minister for Environment, Parks, Heritage and the Arts, Minister for Tourism and Minister for Sport and Recreation in the Bartlett government.

===Speaker of the House of Assembly===
O&#x27;Byrne was re-elected in Bass at the 2024 election and was elected unopposed to the position of Speaker of the House of Assembly on 14 May 2024, the new parliament&#x27;s opening day. Her elevation to the position came despite the Labor Party winning only 10 seats at the election and remaining in opposition.

==Political interests==

A former National co convener of EMILY&#x27;s List Australia, O’Byrne had worked to increase the number of women in Parliament and been responsible for delivering significant legislative reform for women.

O&#x27;Byrne is currently the Australian Chair of the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians who work to increase women&#x27;s participation in political processes globally.

==Personal life==
She is a keen Parkrunner, taking part in Launceston runs when she can.
A proud product of the public education system O&#x27;Byrne and her partner, Priam Arumugam, live in Launceston with their two teenage daughters.

<doc id="583572" wikidata="Q22530" url="?curid=583572" title="Auguste Forel">
<text>Auguste-Henri Forel (; 1 September 1848 – 27 July 1931) was a Swiss myrmecologist, neuroanatomist, psychiatrist and eugenicist, notable for his investigations into the structure of the human brain and that of ants. He is considered a co-founder of the neuron theory. Forel is also known for his early contributions to sexology and psychology. From 1978 until 2000 Forel&#x27;s image appeared on the 1000 Swiss franc banknote.

==Early life==
Born in 1848 in a villa &quot;La Gracieuse&quot;, at Morges, on Lake Geneva, Switzerland, to Victor Forel a pious Swiss Calvinist and Pauline Morin, a French Huguenot he was brought up in a protective household.

Auguste Forel was born in 1848 at Morges on Lake Geneva in Switzerland. His great uncle, who was an entomologist, introduced Forel to insect natural history when he was young. After reading a book by Pierre Huber, he became interested in ants.

==Education==
He went to school at Morges and Lausanne. In 1866 he began his studies at the University of Zurich&#x27;s medical school. While at medical school he continued to collect colonies of ants in order to study their physiology, biology, anatomy, systematic and even posology, as he experimented with the effect of some biochemical agents on them.

In 1871 he went to Vienna and studied under Theodor Meynert (1833-1892), where he did his first comparative study of the thalamus. Forel was disappointed by Meynert.

In Zurich he was inspired by the work of Bernhard von Gudden (1824-1886). In 1873 he moved to Germany to assist Gudden at his Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt. He improved upon various techniques in neuro-anatomy including modifications to Gudden&#x27;s microtome design.

==Neuroscience==
Forel had a diverse and mixed career as a thinker on many subjects.

In Zurich he was inspired by the work of Bernhard von Gudden (1824-1886). In 1873 he moved to Germany to assist Gudden at his Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt. He improved upon various techniques in neuro-anatomy including modifications to Gudden&#x27;s microtome design.

In 1877 he described the nuclear and fibrillar organization of the tegmental region which is now known as &quot;Campus Foreli.&quot; He then became a lecturer at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich while also continuing his research on ants.

===Neuron theory===
Forel realized from experiments that neurons were the basic elements of the nervous system. He found that the neuromuscular junction communicated by mere contact and did not require the anastomosis of fibres. This came to be called the &quot;Contact Theory of Forel&quot;.

The word &quot;neuron&quot; was coined by Wilhelm von Waldeyer who published a review of the work of Forel and others in 1891. Waldeyer synthesized ideas without actually conducting any research himself and published it in &quot;Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift&quot; a widely read journal which made him popular. Forel was very bitter about Waldeyer&#x27;s achievement of fame that it is thought to have contributed to the decline in his interest in neuroanatomy and neurology.

Forel first described in 1877 the zona incerta area in the brain. He gave it this name as it a &quot;region of which nothing certain can be said&quot;.

In 1879, he accepted an appointment as professor of psychiatry at University of Zurich Medical School. He was also assigned to the position of temporary director of the Psychiatric University Hospital Zürich asylumthe Burghölzli asylum, where he worked with only two other physicians treating 300 patients. He remained there for nineteen years, publishing papers on insanity, prison reform, and social morality. Burghölzli was very poorly run with corrupt staff and poor standards before Forel took over and converted to be among the best in Europe.

==Myrmecology==
===Publications===
====&quot;Les fourmis de la Suisse&quot; (1874)====
Following a field trip to southern Switzerland in his early twenties, Forel wrote a 450-page essay, &quot;Les Fourmis de la Suisse&quot;, which was first published in a three part series in a Swiss scientific journal, beginning in 1874. It earned him the Schafli prize awarded by the Swiss Natural History Society. Forel sent Charles Darwin a copy of the essay when it was published as a book in 1874, and Darwin commended his work. The Paris Academy of Science also honored him with the Thore prize for the essay. His 1874 450-page treatise, was selected by scholars for its cultural importanceit is part of the knowledge base of civilization. &quot;Les Fourmis de la Suisse&quot; was commended by Charles Darwin. It was translated into English when it was reissued in 1890.

Sir J.A. Hammerton wrote a chapter entitled &quot;The Senses of Insects: Auguste Forel&quot;, in his 1937 book, &quot;Outline of Great Books&quot; in which he praised Forel&#x27;s 1874 &quot;prize essay on the Ants of Switzerland&quot;. Hammerton said that it was &quot;the most important contribution to insect psychology ever made by a single student...He made the senses and mental faculties of insects his chief study. His work on insects has served the study of human psychology, and is in itself perhaps the most important contribution to insect psychology ever made by a single student.&quot;

====&quot;The Senses of Insects&quot; 1885 (1908)====

In an experiment to better understand ant communication, in 1886, Forel removed the antennas of a large number of ants of different species, then placed them in a box in order to observe their behaviour. He found that the ants without antennae were no longer aggressive towards other ants, in marked contrast to ants with antennae. This confirmed his thesis that ants use their antennas to distinguish friend from foe. He published his findings in English in 1908 in &quot;The Senses of Insects&quot;. In a 2016 study described in the &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot;, the author cited Forel. The experiment was one of a series undertaken in the 1880s and published in German at that time. The 1908 English translation included several previously published studies on the subject.

====&quot;Le Monde Social des Fourmis&quot; (1921)====
In 1919, Forel hired the well-known animal painter Erich W. Heinrich to work with him on his five volume myrmecological magnum opus treatise, &quot;Le Monde social des fourmis du Globe comparé à celui de L&#x27;homme.&quot; The five volumes were published in French in 1921. It was published in English in 1928.

In his 1924 &quot;Nature&quot; review of Forel&#x27;s &quot;Le Monde social des fourmis, compareé à celui de l&#x27;homme in Nature&quot;, Malinowski said taking the analogy between society and organism literally by comparing human society to that of animals, &quot;has misled and wrecked most of the earlier attempts at systematic sociology.&quot; He said that comparisons between &quot;relations between human individuals in society&quot; and that of other living organism&quot; has limited value[a]s a method of sociological research and exposition this simile is worse than useless.&quot;

In 1914, Forel was a good friend of the well-known British entomologist Horace Donisthorpe, with whom he stayed in Switzerland; his ardent socialist views frequently caused political arguments between the two. In Horace Donisthorpe&#x27;s 1927 edition of &quot;British Ants: their life history and classification&quot;. Donisthorpe said, &quot;I should wish ... to protest against the ants being employed as a supposed weapon in political controversy. In my opinion an entomological work is not the appropriate means for the introduction of political theories of any kind, still less for their glaring advertisement.&quot;

===Other myrmecological research===
In 1898, Forel was credited with discovering trophallaxis among ants.

==Legacy==

A travelling exhibition of Forel&#x27;s lifework&quot;August Forel: Arzt Naturforscher Sozialreformer&quot;was shown in 1986 in Zürich, and two years later, in Bern. The founder of the Institute of Brain Research in Zürich, Konrad Akert, described Forel as a &quot;role model&quot; and his contributions as a &quot;social reformer&quot; and scientist, &quot;monumental&quot;. In his 2008 &quot;History of Psychiatry&quot; journal article citing the 1980s exhibitions, Zurich-based psychiatrist, Bernhard Kuechenhoff, said that from the perspective of the twenty first century, Akert&#x27;s &quot;judgement would have to be modified.&quot; According to Kuechenhoff, these exhibitions did not adequately reflect a &quot;complete representation&quot; of Forel&#x27;s life because they ignored and failed to mention &quot;Forel&#x27;s &quot;[latent] racist and eugenic thoughts and ideas&quot; and his related social activism. Kuechenhoff said that while he sought to draw attention to Forel&#x27;s views on these topics, he cautioned against the &quot;risk of a biased judgement.

From 1978 until 2000 Forel&#x27;s image appeared on the 1000 Swiss franc banknote.

Forel International School is named after him.

==Personal life==
Forel named his home as &quot;La Fourmilière&quot;the Ant Colony. Around 1900 Forel was a eugenicist. Forel suffered a stroke that paralyzed his right side in 1912, but he taught himself to write with his left hand and was able to continue his studies. After hearing of the religion from his son in law Dr. Arthur Brauns (married to his daughter Martha), in 1920 he became a member of the Baháʼí Faith, abandoning his former racist and socialist views, writing in his will and testament: 
In 1922 he started a Baháʼí group in Lausanne expounding his own agnostic and leftist ideas in addition to defending the Faith. He received a letter from ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá known as the Tablet to Dr. Auguste Forel expounding on the differences between the mineral, vegetable, animal and human worlds, the spiritual nature of man and proofs of the existence of God. 

Forel married Emma Steinheil in August 1883 and they had four daughters and two sons. In 1903 Forel and his family moved to live in his home, &quot;La Fourmiliere&quot;, in Yvorne near Lake Geneva. He died there on July 27, 1931, and was cremated in Lausanne two days later.

<text>Materva is a mate-based soft drink, originally produced and popularized in Cuba prior to the Cuban Revolution. It has been produced in Miami since the 1960s by Cawy Bottling Company. 

== Drink ==
Materva is a carbonated drink made from yerba mate, a tea popular in Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Unlike the somewhat bitter tea-like mate on which it is based, Materva is sweet, with a flavor described as similar to ginger ale or cream soda. 

Current production includes a diet version called Diet Materva.

==History==
The Materva Soft Drink Company was founded in Matanzas, Cuba, in 1920. Materva became known as a &quot;famous Cuban brand&quot; and advertising included celebrity endorsements that touted the drink&#x27;s energizing properties. 

During the Cuban Revolution, the Materva bottling plant was targeted for strikes by revolutionaries, along with the Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottling plants in the country. Materva was produced and sold in Cuba until 1960 when it was nationalized along with other private industry. It is no longer produced in Cuba. 

The Cawy Bottling Company of Miami was founded to produce the Cawy lemon-lime soda that had been popular in Cuba. The company began producing Materva in the United States in the 1960s in an attempt to diversify after the founder of the company realized that there were many large American companies already competing with lemon-lime drinks.
== Significance in Cuban and Miami culture ==
Materva has been described as a part of the &quot;standard Cuban pantry&quot;, and as &quot;the old standby Cuban soda&quot;. Because of its significance as a popular drink in Cuba prior to the Revolution, it is often cited as a source of &quot;shared memories&quot; and &quot;nostalgia&quot; of pre-Revolutionary Cuba by Cubans who live in the United States. 

In Miami, politicians use the drink to symbolize Cuban-ness, such as when a congressional candidate told local media in 2010 that he had spoken about Materva to President Obama during a presidential visit to the city. Travel books also often recommend the drink to visitors to Miami. In 2002, Materva was given the &quot;Best Local Soft Drink&quot; award by the Miami New Times.

<text>Yangmingshan National Park is one of the nine national parks in Taiwan, located in both Taipei and New Taipei City. The districts that are partially in the park include Taipei&#x27;s Beitou and Shilin Districts; and New Taipei&#x27;s Wanli, Jinshan, Sanzhi and Tamsui Districts. The national park is known for its cherry blossoms, hot springs, sulfur deposits, fumaroles, venomous snakes, and hiking trails, including Taiwan&#x27;s tallest dormant volcano, Qixing (Seven Star) Mountain rising to 1,120 m (3,675 ft).

==History==
This mountain range was originally called &quot;Grass Mountain&quot; () during the Qing Dynasty, in reference to the Datun Mountain (). Officials during this period were worried about thieves stealing sulfur from the rich sulfur deposits in the area, so they would regularly set fire to the mountain. Thus, only grass and no trees could be seen.

, Taiwan&#x27;s first national park, was established on 27 December 1937. It was one of three national parks designated by Governor-General of Taiwan Seizō Kobayashi during Japanese rule.

In 1950, President Chiang Kai-shek renamed Grass Mountain to Yangmingshan to commemorate the Ming Dynasty scholar Wang Yangming. In 1962, the then Taiwan Provincial Bureau of Public Works began to plan the Yangmingshan National Park. The initial planning area was 28,400 hectares, including Mount Kwan-in and the Tatun Volcanic Group.

==Landscape and geology==
Unlike most other national parks, the Yangmingshan National Park has a lower elevation. Although the park&#x27;s elevation ranges from only 200–1120 meters, beautiful landscapes such as ridges, valleys, lakes, waterfalls, and basins are abundant. Andesite rocks make up most of the area&#x27;s geology.

==Xiaoyoukeng==
Xiaoyoukeng () is a post-volcanic geological landscape area located in the north of Taiwan in Yangmingshan National Park at the northwestern foot of Seven Star Mountain. It is approximately 805 meters above sea level and is famed for the fumaroles, sulfur crystals, hot springs and spectacular &#x27;landslide terrain&#x27; formed by post-volcanic activity.

Hiking trails to Seven Star Mountain are accessible from the Xiaoyoukeng parking lot. The top of the trail is 1,120 meters above sea level, which is the highest peak of Taipei City. The Xiaoyoukeng trail can connect to Qixing Park, Menghuan Pond, and Lengshuikeng. The trail also connects to the visitor center, Yangmingshan Second Parking Lot, and the Yangmingshan Bus Station.&lt;

==Flora and fauna==
Due to the effects of post-volcanic activity and precipitation, soil in the region is highly acidic. With the influence of the northeast monsoon and the area&#x27;s microclimates, winter temperatures are much lower than in the surrounding areas. The above factors cause the vegetation to differ from those in other regions at the same latitude. Some medium and high-altitude plants can be found here such as bird-lime tree and hairy Japanese maple. Vegetation groups can be divided into subtropical monsoon rainforests, temperate evergreen broadleaf forests, and mountain ridge grasslands. There are 1360 species of vascular bundle plants in the region. Some of the common ones are red nanmu, large-leaved machilus, Formosan sweet gum, Taiwan cherry, Mori cleyera and dark spotted cherry. The most famous is Taiwan isoetes in Menghuan pond, an aquatic fern only found in Taiwan. Mt. Datun is one of the most well-known places to see some of the 168 species of butterflies in northern Taiwan, With them being most frequently seen from May to August. The most common ones are from the families Papilionidae, Danainae, and Nymphalidae. There are also 122 species of birds in the region. Semi-feral cattle are one of the notable attractions in the area.
==Climate==
Yangmingshan has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa). Summers are warm, humid, and accompanied by torrential rainstorms; while winters are cool, very wet, and very foggy due to the northeasterly winds from the vast Siberian High being intensified by the pooling of this cooler air in the Taipei Basin. Due to Taiwan&#x27;s location in the Pacific Ocean, it is affected by the Pacific typhoon season, which occurs between June and October. 

The following climate data is for the Anbu weather station. Other places in the national park may have different temperatures.

<text>Ivie Anderson (sometimes Ivy) (July 10, 1905 – December 28, 1949) was an American jazz singer. Anderson was a member of the Duke Ellington Orchestra for more than a decade.

==Personal life==
Ivie Anderson was born July 10, 1905, in Gilroy, California. Although her mother&#x27;s name is unknown, her father was Jobe Smith. From 1914 to 1918 (age nine to 13), Anderson attended St. Mary&#x27;s Convent and studied voice. At Gilroy grammar school and Gilroy High School, she joined glee club and choral society. She also studied voice under Sara Ritt while in Nannie H. Burroughs Institution in Washington, D.C. From 1930 to 1945, Anderson lived at 724 East 52nd Place in Los Angeles, part of the 52nd Place Historic District.

== Career ==
Anderson&#x27;s singing career began around 1921 with performances in Los Angeles. In 1924, she toured with the musical &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;. By 1925, she had performed in Cuba, the Cotton Club in New York City, and Los Angeles with the bands of Paul Howard, Curtis Mosby, and Sonny Clay. In 1928, she sang in Australia with Clay&#x27;s band and starred in Frank Sebastian&#x27;s Cotton Club in Los Angeles in April. Soon after, she began touring in the United States as a solo singer.

From 1930 to early 1931, with pianist Earl Hines&#x27;s band, Anderson performed in a 20-week residency at the Grand Terrace in Chicago, Illinois. In 1931, she became the first full-time vocalist in the Duke Ellington orchestra. Her career for over a decade consisted of touring with Ellington. Her first appearance on record, &quot;It Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing (If It Ain&#x27;t Got That Swing)&quot;, recorded in 1932, was a hit. She participated in Ellington&#x27;s first European tour in 1933. In 1940, she recorded &quot;Solitude&quot;, &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;, and &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;. One of the rare occasions Anderson sang independently of Ellington in this period was her performance of &quot;All God&#x27;s Children Got Rhythm&quot; in the Marx Brothers film &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

Owing to her chronic asthma, Anderson left Ellington&#x27;s band in 1942. She started the Chicken Shack restaurant in Los Angeles with Marque Neal after they married but sold the business when they divorced. She had a second marriage with Walter Collins. Anderson died in Los Angeles in December, 1949 of an asthma-related illness. Although her earliest obituary was dated December 27, 1949, later sources state her date of death as December 28, 1949.

==Comments about Ivie Anderson==
Anderson often received prominent billing on advertisements for Ellington&#x27;s appearances in theatres, auditoriums, arenas, and ballrooms, wherever the Ellington band toured in the 1930s. She sang pop tunes and ballads and was the band&#x27;s scat singer, imitating instrumental sounds and vocalizations. She was said to be one of Ellington&#x27;s finest and most versatile singers before Swedish vocalist Alice Babs performed with the band. Ellington wrote &quot;Music Is My Mistress&quot; (1973) with Anderson in mind.

When Anderson played in Ellington&#x27;s musical &quot;Jump for Joy&quot;, the &quot;California Eagle&quot; wrote of her:&quot;Ivie can sing a song so that the audience get every word, and at the same time make cracks at Sonny Greer, tease Duke and wink at the boys in the front row. Wednesday night she went into a dance routine that would have slayed you.&quot;

<doc id="583598" wikidata="Q1140866" url="?curid=583598" title="Oxygen cycle">
<text>Oxygen cycle refers to the movement of oxygen through the atmosphere (air), biosphere (plants and animals) and the lithosphere (the Earth’s crust). The oxygen cycle demonstrates how free oxygen is made available in each of these regions, as well as how it is used. The oxygen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle of oxygen atoms between different oxidation states in ions, oxides, and molecules through redox reactions within and between the spheres/reservoirs of the planet Earth. The word oxygen in the literature typically refers to the most common oxygen allotrope, elemental/diatomic oxygen (O2), as it is a common product or reactant of many biogeochemical redox reactions within the cycle. Processes within the oxygen cycle are considered to be biological or geological and are evaluated as either a source (O2 production) or sink (O2 consumption).

Oxygen is one of the most common elements on Earth and represents a large portion of each main reservoir. By far the largest reservoir of Earth&#x27;s oxygen is within the silicate and oxide minerals of the crust and mantle (99.5% by weight). The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere together hold less than 0.05% of the Earth&#x27;s total mass of oxygen. Besides O2, additional oxygen atoms are present in various forms spread throughout the surface reservoirs in the molecules of biomass, H2O, CO2, HNO3, NO, NO2, CO, H2O2, O3, SO2, H2SO4, MgO, CaO, Al2O3, SiO2, and PO4.

== Atmosphere ==
The atmosphere is 21% oxygen by volume, which equates to a total of roughly 34 × 1018 mol of oxygen. Other oxygen-containing molecules in the atmosphere include ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor (H2O), and sulphur and nitrogen oxides (SO2, NO, N2O, etc.).

== Biosphere ==
The biosphere is 22% oxygen by volume, present mainly as a component of organic molecules (CxHxNxOx) and water.

== Hydrosphere ==
The hydrosphere is 33% oxygen by volume present mainly as a component of water molecules, with dissolved molecules including free oxygen and carbolic acids (HxCO3).

== Lithosphere ==
The lithosphere is 46.6% oxygen by volume, present mainly as silica minerals (SiO2) and other oxide minerals.

== Sources and sinks ==
While there are many abiotic sources and sinks for O2, the presence of the profuse concentration of free oxygen in modern Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and ocean is attributed to O2 production from the biological process of oxygenic photosynthesis in conjunction with a biological sink known as the biological pump and a geologic process of carbon burial involving plate tectonics. Biology is the main driver of O2 flux on modern Earth, and the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which is discussed as part of the Great Oxygenation Event, is thought to be directly responsible for the conditions permitting the development and existence of all complex eukaryotic metabolism.

=== Biological production ===
The main source of atmospheric free oxygen is photosynthesis, which produces sugars and free oxygen from carbon dioxide and water:

:formula_1

Photosynthesizing organisms include the plant life of the land areas, as well as the phytoplankton of the oceans. The tiny marine cyanobacterium &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; was discovered in 1986 and accounts for up to half of the photosynthesis of the open oceans.

=== Abiotic production ===
An additional source of atmospheric free oxygen comes from photolysis, whereby high-energy ultraviolet radiation breaks down atmospheric water and nitrous oxide into component atoms. The free hydrogen and nitrogen atoms escape into space, leaving O2 in the atmosphere: 
:formula_2
:formula_3

=== Biological consumption ===
The main way free oxygen is lost from the atmosphere is via respiration and decay, mechanisms in which animal life and bacteria consume oxygen and release carbon dioxide.

== Capacities and fluxes ==
The following tables offer estimates of oxygen cycle reservoir capacities and fluxes. 
These numbers are based primarily on estimates from (Walker, J. C. G.): More recent research indicates that ocean life (marine primary production) is actually responsible for more than half the total oxygen production on Earth.
&lt;br&gt;
Table 2: Annual gain and loss of atmospheric oxygen (Units of 1010 kg O2 per year)

== Ozone ==

The presence of atmospheric oxygen has led to the formation of ozone (O3) and the ozone layer within the stratosphere:

:formula_4
:formula_5
:O + O2 :- O3

The ozone layer is extremely important to modern life as it absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation:

<text>In algebra, the theory of equations is the study of algebraic equations (also called &quot;polynomial equations&quot;), which are equations defined by a polynomial. The main problem of the theory of equations was to know when an algebraic equation has an algebraic solution. This problem was completely solved in 1830 by Évariste Galois, by introducing what is now called Galois theory.

Before Galois, there was no clear distinction between the &quot;theory of equations&quot; and &quot;algebra&quot;. Since then algebra has been dramatically enlarged to include many new subareas, and the theory of algebraic equations receives much less attention. Thus, the term &quot;theory of equations&quot; is mainly used in the context of the history of mathematics, to avoid confusion between old and new meanings of &quot;algebra&quot;.

==History==
Until the end of the 19th century, &quot;theory of equations&quot; was almost synonymous with &quot;algebra&quot;. For a long time, the main problem was to find the solutions of a single non-linear polynomial equation in a single unknown. The fact that a complex solution always exists is the fundamental theorem of algebra, which was proved only at the beginning of the 19th century and does not have a purely algebraic proof. Nevertheless, the main concern of the algebraists was to solve in terms of radicals, that is to express the solutions by a formula which is built with the four operations of arithmetics and with nth roots. This was done up to degree four during the 16th century. Scipione del Ferro and Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia discovered solutions for cubic equations. Gerolamo Cardano published them in his 1545 book &quot;Ars Magna&quot;, together with a solution for the quartic equations, discovered by his student Lodovico Ferrari. In 1572 Rafael Bombelli published his &quot;L&#x27;Algebra&quot; in which he showed how to deal with the imaginary quantities that could appear in Cardano&#x27;s formula for solving cubic equations.

The case of higher degrees remained open until the 19th century, when Paolo Ruffini gave an incomplete proof in 1799 that some fifth degree equations cannot be solved in radicals followed by Niels Henrik Abel&#x27;s complete proof in 1824 (now known as the Abel–Ruffini theorem). Évariste Galois later introduced a theory (presently called Galois theory) to decide which equations are solvable by radicals.

==Further problems==
Other classical problems of the theory of equations are the following:
* Linear equations: this problem was solved during antiquity.
* Simultaneous linear equations: The general theoretical solution was provided by Gabriel Cramer in 1750. However devising efficient methods (algorithms) to solve these systems remains an active subject of research now called linear algebra.
* Finding the integer solutions of an equation or of a system of equations. These problems are now called Diophantine equations, which are considered a part of number theory (see also integer programming).
* Systems of polynomial equations: Because of their difficulty, these systems, with few exceptions, have been studied only since the second part of the 19th century. They have led to the development of algebraic geometry.

<doc id="583616" wikidata="Q2098331" url="?curid=583616" title="Internal rhyme">
<text>In poetry, internal rhyme, or middle rhyme, is rhyme that occurs within a single line of verse, or between internal phrases across multiple lines. By contrast, rhyme between line endings is known as end rhyme.

Internal rhyme schemes can be denoted with spaces or commas between lines. For example, denotes a three-line poem with the same internal rhyme on each line, and the same end rhyme on each line (which does not rhyme with the internal rhyme).

== Examples ==

===Poetry===
In the following limerick, each stressed syllable rhymes with another stressed syllable using one of three rhyme sets. Each rhyme set is indicated by a different highlight color. Note that the yellow rhyme set provides internal rhyme in lines 1, 2, and 5, and end rhymes in lines 3 and 4, whereas the blue set is entirely internal, and the pink is exclusively end rhymes.

&lt;poem&gt;
Each time alie for a 
She well that her are the 
Of the , and it ,
But this will ex
More than , so some gape and .
&lt;/poem&gt;
Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; is filled with lines that include internal rhyme, such as &quot;The guests are met, the feast is set&quot;; &quot;The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared&quot;; and &quot;It cracked and growled, and roared and howled&quot;. Internal rhymes were a trademark of 19th century English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, for instance, in &quot;God&#x27;s Grandeur&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;Why do men then now not reck his rod?
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;
 And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;
 And wears man&#x27;s smudge and shares man&#x27;s smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Percy Dearmer (1867–1936) revised John Bunyan&#x27;s (1628–1688) poem &quot;To Be a Pilgrim&quot; in 1906. It became a popular hymn when Charles Winfred Douglas (1867–1944) set it to music in 1917. Here are Dearmer&#x27;s lyrics, with the internal rhymes in bold. Notice that in these three quatrains the internal rhymes are also echoed in the line rhymes (also in bold).
&lt;poem&gt;He who would valiant be &#x27;gainst all disaster,
Let him in constancy follow the Master.
There’s no discouragement shall make him once relent
His first avowed intent to be a pilgrim.

Who so beset him round with dismal stories
Do but themselves confound—his strength the more is.
No foes shall stay his might; though he with giants fight,
He will make good his right to be a pilgrim.

Since, Lord, Thou dost defend us with Thy Spirit,
We know we at the end, shall life inherit.
Then fancies flee away! I’ll fear not what men say,
I’ll labor night and day to be a pilgrim.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Popular music===
In the comic operas he wrote with Arthur Sullivan, W. S. Gilbert (1836–1911) used internal rhymes in some of his song lyrics. For example, Bunthorne&#x27;s solo aria from &quot;Patience&quot; begins:

&lt;poem&gt;
If you&#x27;re anxious for to shine in the high aesthetic line
As a man of culture rare,
You must get up all the germs of the transcendental terms,
And plant them everywhere.
You must lie upon the daisies and discourse in novel phrases
Of your complicated state of mind,
The meaning doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s only idle chatter
Of a transcendental kind.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Internal rhyme schemes were common in popular songs of the Swing Era. One illustration is the bridge from &quot;Don&#x27;t Fence Me In&quot;, written by Cole Porter for the 1944 film &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
Just turn me loose let me straddle my old saddle,
Underneath the western skies,
On my cayuse let me wander over yonder,
&#x27;Til I see the mountains rise.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Bob Dylan often used internal rhymes in his lyrics, such as in &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
&lt;/poem&gt;
And &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn&#x27;t you?
People&#x27;d call, say, &quot;Beware doll, you&#x27;re bound to fall&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Other pop, rock, and R&amp;B lyricists from the 1960s and &#x27;70s employed the technique more sparingly than Dylan, for example, Smokey Robinson in &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot;: &quot;In order to shield my pride, I&#x27;ve tried&quot;; and Carly Simon in &quot;Anticipation&quot;: &quot;When I was thinking about how right tonight might be&quot;.

===Rap and hip-hop===
Internal rhyme is used extensively in rap and hip-hop music, where it sometimes overlaps with assonance. The usage of internal rhyme in rap has increased over time, but can be found even in the earliest rap songs, such as the Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s 1979 single, &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
I&#x27;m six-foot-one and I&#x27;m tons of fun and I dress to a T
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got body guards, I got two big cars, I definitely ain&#x27;t the whack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sun-roofed Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV, so I can see the Knicks play basketball
&lt;/poem&gt;

Internal rhyme is used frequently by many different hip-hop artists, including Kool Moe Dee, Big Daddy Kane, Nas, and Rakim, as demonstrated in Eric B. and Rakim&#x27;s 1987 piece, &quot;My Melody&quot; from their debut album &quot;Paid In Full&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;My unusual style will confuse you a while
If I were water, I&#x27;d flow in the Nile
So many rhymes you won&#x27;t have time to go for yours
Just because of applause I have to pause
Right after tonight is when I prepare
To catch another sucker-duck MC out there
My strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe
And after this you&#x27;ll call me your majesty...&lt;/poem&gt;

Another prominent hip-hop artist who uses complex internal rhymes is AZ, as shown in &quot;The Format&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
Young and gifted, my tongue&#x27;s prolific
In the beach bungalow is how I brung in Christmas
To the streets I&#x27;mma flow from the hungriest districts
Swiss kicks crisp when I come to them picnics
Play slow, paper chase stack and lay low
Range rove tinted all black the same old
Psychic mind, righteous rhymes that turned a new leaf from a life of crime
No concerns with new beef, who&#x27;s as nice as I&#x27;m
It&#x27;s confirmed, from few feet I&#x27;m still a sniper blind
Built my fame, spilt my pain
Politicking daily, still trying to milk the game
It&#x27;s obvious that I&#x27;m real, rap skills remain
I took some change and I&#x27;m still the same
&lt;/poem&gt;

Black Thought, rapper from The Roots, uses internal rhymes in the song &quot;Respond/React&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;
The attractive assassin, blastin the devil trespassin
Master gettin cash in an orderly fashion
Message to the fake n**** flashin
Slow up Ahk, before you get dropped and closed like a caption
Fractional kids don&#x27;t know the time for action
Styles got the rhythm that of an Anglo-Saxon
Round of applause, an avalanche of clappin
{*BLOW*} that&#x27;s what happen, now what&#x27;s your reaction
We heavyweight traction, pro-pornographin
Specialize in science and math and, original black man
Bustin thoughts that pierce your mental
The fierce rippin your sacks and
Vocal toe to toe impeccable splittin your back son
Simple as addition and subtraction
Black Thought, the infinite relaxed one
Shorties say they love it with a passion
Bring the international charm, see a squad I harass
&lt;/poem&gt;

MF Doom uses almost every word as internal rhyme in this verse in his song, &quot;Figaro&quot;. (Rhymes highlighted)

&lt;poem&gt;
It&#x27;s , 
 , 
 but , , 
Not 
 through 
 how with 
&lt;/poem&gt;

Kool Keith heavily utilises internal rhyme in his song &quot;3000&quot; to effectively throw off the listener.

&lt;poem&gt;
As studies have shown; participator acts , 
And mess up water the that comes from the 
In the the you , ence
What is you , ing 
Commercial in the , stuff on disc that&#x27;s very 
That you , you think it&#x27;s won&#x27;t go inum
Or even turn , sell the 
Your homey&#x27;s tape 
You my , my chicken on the 
Open your and see 
Rap moves on to the year three thousand!
&lt;/poem&gt;Bad Lip Reading uses internal rhyme in their comedic song “My Stick”.

&lt;poem&gt;
I disappear for years then reappear right here to cheer about my cool stick…
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation (commonly known as the Blue Book or Harvard Citator) is a style guide that prescribes the most widely used legal citation system in the United States. It is taught and used at a majority of U.S. law schools and is also used in a majority of federal courts. Legal publishers also use several &quot;house&quot; citation styles in their works.

&quot;The Bluebook&quot; is compiled by the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; Association, the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot;, the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, and the &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot;. Currently, it is in its 21st edition (published July2020). Its name was first used for the 6th edition (1939). Opinions have differed regarding its origins at Yale and Harvard Law Schools, with the latter long claiming credit. 

The Supreme Court uses its own unique citation style in its opinions, even though most of the justices and their law clerks obtained their legal education at law schools that use &quot;The Bluebook&quot;. Furthermore, many state courts have their own citation rules that take precedence over the guide for documents filed with those courts. Some of the local rules are simple modifications to &quot;The Bluebook&quot; system. Delaware&#x27;s Supreme Court has promulgated rules of citation for unreported cases markedly different from its standards, and custom in that state as to the citation format of the Delaware Uniform Citation code also differs from it. In other states, the local rules differ from &quot;The Bluebook&quot; in that they use their own style guides. Attorneys in those states must be able to switch seamlessly between citation styles depending upon whether their work product is intended for a federal or state court. California has allowed citations in Bluebook as well as the state&#x27;s own style manual, but many practitioners and courts continue recommending the &quot;California Style Manual&quot;.

An online-subscription version of &quot;The Bluebook&quot; was launched in 2008. A mobile version was launched in 2012 within the Rulebook app, which enables access for legal professionals to federal or state court rules, codes, and style manuals on iPad, and other mobile devices.

== Elements ==

The 21st edition of &quot;The Bluebook&quot; governs the style and formatting of various references and elements of a legal publication, including:
* Structure and use of citations
* Typefaces for law reviews
* Subdivisions
* Short citation forms (for use when a document makes multiple references to the same case)
* Quotations
* Abbreviations, numerals, and symbols
* Italicization for style and in unique circumstances
* Capitalization
* Titles of judges, officials, and terms of court
* Cases
* Constitutions
* Statutes
* Legislative materials
* Administrative and executive materials
* Books, reports, and other nonperiodic materials
* Periodical materials
* Unpublished and forthcoming sources
* Electronic media and other nonprint resources
* Services
* Foreign materials
* International materials
== History ==
While the legal citation manuals go as far back as 15th century (&quot;Modus Legendi Abbreviaturas in Utroque Iure&quot;, ), there were very few examples prior to the 20th century; law professor Byron D. Cooper mentions only few short articles &quot;Rules for Citation&quot; (The American Law Review, 1896) and &quot;Methods of Citing Statute Law&quot; (Ruppenthal, Law Library Journal, 1919). The &quot;Uniform System of Citations&quot; thus became a &quot;pioneer&quot; manual.

According to Harvard, the origin of &quot;The Bluebook&quot; was a pamphlet for proper citation forms for articles in the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; written by its editor, Erwin Griswold. However, according to a 2016 study by two Yale librarians, Harvard&#x27;s claim is incorrect. They trace the origin of &quot;The Bluebook&quot; to a 1920 publication by Karl N. Llewellyn at Yale on how to write law journal materials for the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. The authors point out that some of the material in the 1926 first edition of &quot;The Bluebook&quot; (as well as that in a 1922 Harvard precursor to it published as &quot;Instructions for Editorial Work&quot;) duplicate material in the 1920 Llewellen booklet and its 1921 successor, a blue pamphlet that the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; published as &quot;Abbreviations and Form of Citation&quot;.

For several years before the first edition of &quot;The Bluebook&quot; appeared, Yale, Columbia, and several other law journals &quot;worked out a tentative citation plan&quot;, but Harvard initially opposed it &quot;because of skepticism as to the results to be attained and in part because of a desire not to deviate from our forms especially at the solicitation of other Reviews&quot;. Eventually, Harvard &quot;reversed course&quot; and joined the coalition by 1926. According to Judge Henry J. Friendly, &quot;Attorney General [Herbert] Brownell, whom I had known ever since law school—he was Editor-in-Chief of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; the year I was at the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; and he and I and two others [from Columbia and Pennsylvania] were the authors of the first edition of the &quot;Bluebook&quot;.&quot;

The cover of the 1926 &quot;A Uniform System of Citation&quot; was green. The color was &quot;brown from the second (1928) edition through the fifth (1936) edition. It was only with the sixth (1939) edition that it became blue.&quot; In 1939, the cover of the book was changed from brown to a &quot;more patriotic blue&quot;, allegedly to avoid comparison with a color associated with Nazi Germany. The eleventh edition, published in 1967, was actually white with a blue border. The cover color returned to blue in the twelfth edition of 1976.

The full text of the first (1926) through the fifteenth (1991) editions is available on the official website.

&quot;The Bluebook&quot; uses two different styles. Practitioners use the first in preparing court documents and memoranda, while the second is used primarily in academic settings, such as law reviews and journals. The latter uses specific formatting to identify types of references, such as the use of small caps for books, newspapers, and law reviews. A rule of thumb used by many is to see if the formatting can be reproduced on a typewriter—if so, practitioners use it, if it requires typesetting, it is used for academic articles.

By 2011, &quot;The Bluebook&quot; was &quot;the main guide and source of authority&quot; on legal references for the past 90 years. It is recognized as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for legal references in the United States, even though it was originally designed only to help teach law students how to cite cases and other legal material. Although other citation systems exist, they have limited acceptance, and in general, &quot;The Bluebook&quot; is followed in the legal citation as the most widely accepted citation style, called the &quot;Bible&quot;, the &quot;final arbiter&quot;, even the legal citation &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;. Some states have adopted &quot;The Bluebook&quot; in full, while others have partially adopted &quot;The Bluebook&quot;. States such as Texas have supplements, such as &quot;The Greenbook&quot;, that merely address citation issues unique to Texas and otherwise follow &quot;The Bluebook&quot;.

== Variations ==

=== Federal ===
The Solicitor General issues a style guide that is designed to supplement &quot;The Bluebook&quot;. This guide focuses on citation for practitioners, so as an example, only two typefaces are used for law reviews, normal and italics. Other changes are also minor, such as moving &quot;supra&quot; from before the page referenced to after the page number. The guide does state that unless explicitly specified otherwise, &quot;The Bluebook&quot; rule takes precedence in the event of conflict.

=== State ===
California used to require use of the &quot;California Style Manual&quot;. In 2008, the California Supreme Court issued a rule giving an option of using either the &quot;California Style Manual&quot; or &quot;The Bluebook&quot;. The two styles are significantly different in citing cases, in use of &quot;ibid.&quot; or &quot;id.&quot; (for &quot;&quot;), and in citing books and journals. Michigan uses a separate official citation system issued as an administrative order of the Michigan Supreme Court. The primary difference is that the Michigan system &quot;omits all periods in citations, uses italics somewhat differently, and does not use &#x27;small caps.&#x27;&quot; As noted, Texas merely supplements &quot;The Bluebook&quot; with items that are unique to Texas courts, such as citing cases when Texas was an independent republic, petition and writ history, Attorney General Opinions, and similar issues.

== Reception ==

=== Criticism of &quot;Bluebook&quot;″s prolixity ===

At over 500 pages for the 19th edition, &quot;The Bluebook&quot; is significantly more complicated than the citation systems used by most other fields. Legal scholars have called for its replacement with a simpler system. The University of Chicago uses the simplified &quot;Maroonbook&quot;, and even simpler systems are in use by other parties.

Judge Richard Posner is &quot;one of the founding fathers of &quot;Bluebook&quot; abolitionism, having advocated it for almost twenty-five years, ever since his 1986 &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot; article on the subject.&quot; In a 2011 &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; article, he wrote:
&quot;The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation&quot; exemplifies hypertrophy in the anthropological sense. It is a monstrous growth, remote from the functional need for legal citation forms, that serves obscure needs of the legal culture and its student subculture.
He wrote that a cursory look at the Nineteenth Edition &quot;put [him] in mind of Mr. Kurtz&#x27;s dying words in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;—&#x27;The horror! The horror!&#x27;&quot;

Posner personally uses a far simpler citation system based largely on the First Edition of the &quot;Bluebook&quot;. This system, which he includes in a manual he provides for his law clerks, was reprinted in the aforementioned &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; article. At the time of the article, his citation system was 885 &quot;words&quot; long, or about two printed pages—far shorter than the 511 pages of the Nineteenth Edition, the 640 pages of the then-current &quot;ALWD Citation Manual&quot;, or the over 1,000 pages of the &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot;.

=== &quot;BabyBlue&quot; copyright controversy ===

Another dispute is over the copyright status of &quot;The Bluebook&quot;. Open-source advocates claim that &quot;The Bluebook&quot; is not protected under copyright because it is a critical piece of legal infrastructure. Lawyers who represent the Bluebook publishing consortium claim that the &quot;carefully curated examples, explanations and other textual materials&quot; are protected by copyright.

A group led by Professor Christopher J. Sprigman at NYU Law School prepared a &quot;public-domain implementation of the &quot;Bluebook&quot; Uniform System of Citation,&quot; which his group calls &quot;BabyBlue&quot;. However, a law firm (Ropes &amp; Gray) representing the Harvard Law Review Association (HLRA) sent him a letter stating:

In response to the HLRA letter to Sprigman, over 150 students, faculty, staff, and alumni of Harvard Law School signed a petition supporting &quot;BabyBlue&quot;. Yale and NYU students added their separate petitions supporting &quot;BabyBlue&quot;. A posting in the &quot;Harvard Law Record&quot; commented:

The posting also suggested that HLRA should &quot;redirect the money it spends on legal fees ($185,664 in 2013)&quot; to a more worthy purpose.

David Post commented: &quot;It&#x27;s copyright nonsense, and Harvard should be ashamed of itself for loosing its legal hounds to dispense it in order to protect its (apparently fairly lucrative) publication monopoly.&quot;

On March 31, 2016, it was announced that the project had changed its name to the &quot;Indigo Book&quot;.

== Financial controversy ==

For the first 50 years of the &quot;Bluebook&quot;&#x27;s history, the Harvard Law Review kept 100 percent of the revenues. In 1974, the editors of the &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Reviews&quot; and the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; apparently discovered this, due to an indiscretion. They complained that Harvard was illegally keeping all profits from the first eleven editions, estimated to total $20,000 per year. After they threatened to sue, and considerable wrangling, Harvard agreed with them to split the revenue: 40 percent for Harvard, 20 percent each for Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Yale; Harvard would continue to provide the production and distribution services.

The law reviews have not disclosed the revenues of the &quot;Bluebook&quot; themselves, but revenues from the sale of the &quot;Bluebook&quot; have been estimated &quot;in the millions of dollars&quot;.

A 2022 review of the Harvard Law Review&#x27;s non-profit disclosures found that the &quot;Bluebook&quot; had made $1.2 million in profits in 2020, with &quot;The Harvard Law Review&quot; taking an 8.5% cut of profits for administrative services and the remainder split equally among the four law reviews. Profits from the &quot;Bluebook&quot; totaled $16 million between 2011 and 2020. Excluding the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, the law review&#x27;s endowments total $59.4 million.

== Legal technology and future ==

The &quot;Bluebook&quot; has also been affected by the disruptions to the legal industry due to legal technology. In 2017, the startup company LegalEase launched a legal citation generator that enables its users to create citations in the &quot;Bluebook&quot; format. LawStar.io offers a similar product with the addition of 1-click citations.

<doc id="583635" wikidata="Q574355" url="?curid=583635" title="Kapila">
<text>Kapila () (7th-6th-century BCE), also referred to as Cakradhanus, is a Vedic sage in Hindu tradition, regarded the founder of the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy.

His influence on Buddha and Buddhism has long been the subject of scholarly studies. There have been accusations by orthodox Buddhists that Sarvastivadins are heavily influenced by Samkhya school of philosophy.

According to the Brahmanda Purana, Kapila is described as an incarnation of Vishnu: &quot;Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa will protect us all. The Lord of the universe has now been born in the world as Kapilācārya.&quot;

Many historic personalities in Hinduism and Jainism, mythical figures, pilgrimage sites in Indian religion, as well as an ancient variety of cow, are named after Kapila, or share his name.

==Biography==
The name Kapila appears in many texts, and it is likely that these names refer to different people. The most famous reference is to the sage Kapila with his student Āsuri, who in the Indian tradition, are considered as the first masters of Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. While he pre-dates Buddha, it is unclear which century he lived in, with some suggesting 6th-century BCE. Others place him in the 7th century BCE. This places him in the late Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE), and he has been called a Vedic sage.

Kapila is credited with authoring an influential sutra, called Samkhya-sutra (also called Kapila-sutra), which aphoristically presents the dualistic philosophy of Samkhya. These sutras were explained in another well studied text of Hinduism called the Samkhyakarika. Beyond his Samkhya philosophy, he appears in many dialogues of Hindu texts, such as in explaining and defending the principle of ahimsa (non-violence) in the Mahabharata.

== Hinduism ==
Kapila is the tenth child of the sage Kardama and Devahūti. Kardama is provided a boon by Narayana that he would himself be born as his son. After attaining this, Kardama wished to leave for the forest for penance and research and Vedic study. Kardama had nine daughters who were very learned and went ahead to marry great sages mentioned in ancient Indian history.

=== Vedic texts ===
The Rigveda X.27.16 mentions Kapila (&quot;daśānām ekam kapilam&quot;) which the 14th-century Vedic commentator Sayana thought refers to a sage; a view which Chakravarti in 1951 and Larson in 1987 consider unreliable, with Chakravarti suggesting that the word refers to one of the Maruts, while Larson and Bhattacharya state kapilam in that verse means &quot;tawny&quot; or &quot;reddish-brown&quot;; as is also translated by Griffith.

The Śata-piṭaka Series on the Śākhās of the Yajurveda – estimated to have been composed between 1200 and 1000 BCE – mention of a &quot;Kapila Śākhā&quot; situated in the Āryāvarta, which implies a Yajurveda school is named after Kapila. The term Kapileya, meaning &quot;clans of Kapila&quot;, occurs in the Aitareya Brahmana VII.17 but provides no information on the original Kapila. The pariśiṣṭa (addenda) of the Atharvaveda (at XI.III.3.4) mentions Kapila, Āsuri and Pañcaśikha in connection with a libation ritual for whom &quot;tarpana&quot; is to be offered. In verse 5.2 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, states Larson, both the terms Samkhya and Kapila appear, with Kapila meaning colour as well as a &quot;seer&quot; (Rishi) with the phrase &quot;ṛṣiṃ prasūtaṃ kapilam ... tam agre..&quot;; which when compared to other verses of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad Kapila likely construes to Rudra and Hiranyagarbha. However, Max Muller is of view that Hiranyagarbha, namely Kapila in this context, varies with the tenor of the Upanishad, is distinct and is later used to link Kapila and assign the authorship of Samkya system to Hiranyagarbha in reverence for the philosophical system.

=== Puranas ===
Kapila, states George Williams, lived long before the composition of the Epics and the Puranas, and his name is coopted in various later composed mythologies.

*As an ascetic and as sleeping Vishnu: In the Brahma Purana, when the evil king Vena abandoned the Vedas, declared that he is the only creator of dharma, and broke all limits of righteousness. It is also believed that Kapila is the 5th incarnation of lord vishnu who was born in a village Mahangupur near the banks of river Saryu in Gonda district of Uttarpradesh and is killed, Kapila advises hermits to churn Vena&#x27;s thigh from which emerged Nishadas, and his right hand from which Prthu originated who made earth productive again. Kapila and hermits then went to Kapilasangama, a holy place where rivers meet. The Brahma Purana also mentions Kapila in the context of Sagara&#x27;s 60,000 sons who looking for their Ashvamedha horse, disturbed Vishnu who is sleeping in the shape of Kapila. He woke up, the brilliance in his eyes burnt all but four of Sagara&#x27;s sons to ashes, leaving few survivors carrying on the family lineage. Sagara&#x27;s son is King Dilipa and his grandson is Bhagiratha. On the advice of his guru Trithala, Bhagiratha did penance for a thousand years (according to god timeline) to please Ganga, to gain the release his 60,000 great-uncles from the curse of saint Kapila.
*As Vishnu&#x27;s incarnation: The Narada Purana enumerates two Kapilas, one as the incarnation of Brahma and another as the incarnation of Vishnu. The Puranas Bhagavata, Brahmanda, Vishnu, Padma, Skanda, Narada Purana; and the Valmiki Ramayana mentions Kapila is an incarnation of Vishnu. The Padma Purana and Skanda Purana conclusively call him Vishnu himself who descended on earth to disseminate true knowledge. Bhagavata Purana calls him &quot;Vedagarbha Vishnu&quot;. The Vishnusahasranama mentions Kapila as a name of Vishnu. In his commentary on the Samkhyasutra, Vijnanabhikshu mentions Kapila, the founder of Samkhya system, is Vishnu. Jacobsen suggests Kapila of the Veda, Śramaṇa tradition and the Mahabharata is the same person as Kapila the founder of Samkhya; and this individual is considered as an incarnation of Vishnu in the Hindu texts.
*As son of Kardama muni: The Book 3 of the Bhagavata Purana, states Kapila is the son of Kardama Prajapati and his wife Devahuti. Kardama is born from Chaya, the reflection of Brahma. Brahma asks Kardama to procreate upon which Kardama goes to the banks of Sarasvati river, practices penance, visualizes Vishnu and is told by Vishnu that Manu, the son of Brahma will arrive there with his wife Shatarupa in search of a groom for their daughter Devahuti. Vishnu advises Kardama to marry Devahuti, and blesses Kardama that he himself will be born as his son. Besides Kapila as their only son, Kardama and Devahuti had nine daughters, namely Kala, Anusuya, Sraddha, Havirbhu, Gati, Kriya, Khyati, Arundhati and Shanti who were married to Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhrigu, Vashistha, and Atharvan respectively. H.H.Wilson notes the Bhagavatha adds a third daughter Devahuti to introduce the long legend of Kardama, and of their son Kapila, an account not found elsewhere. Kapila is described, states Daniel Sheridan, by the redactor of the Purana, as an incarnation of the supreme being Vishnu, in order to reinforce the Purana teaching by linking it to the traditional respect to Kapila&#x27;s Samkhya in Hinduism. In the Bhagavata Purana, Kapila presents to his mother Devahuti, the philosophy of yoga and theistic dualism. Kapila&#x27;s Samkhya is also described through Krishna to Uddhava in Book 11 of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, a passage also known as the &quot;Uddhava Gita&quot;.
*As son of Kashyapa: The Matsya Purana mentions Kapila as the son of Kashyapa from his wife Danu, daughter of Daksha Prajapati. Kapila is one among Danu&#x27;s 100 sons, and her other sons (Kapila&#x27;s brothers) mentioned in the Vishnu Purana include Dvimurddha, Shankara, Ayomukha, Shankhushiras, Samvara, Ekachakra, Taraka, Vrishaparvan, Svarbhanu, Puloman, Viprachitti and other Danavas.
*As son of Vitatha or Bharadwaja: In the Brahma Purana and in the Harivamsa Kapila is the son of Vitatha. Daniélou translates Vitatha to inaccuracy; and Wilson notes Bharadwaja is also named Vitatha (unprofitable); while he is given in adoption to Bharata. Vishnu Purana notes Bhavanmanyu is the son of Vitatha but Brahma Purana and Harivamsa omit this and make Suhotra, Anuhotra, Gaya, Garga, and Kapila the sons of Vitatha. The Brahma Purana differs from other puranas in saying Vitatha is the son of Bharadwaja; and upon the death of Bharata, Bharadwaja installed Vitatha as the king, before leaving for the forest.

=== Dharmasutras and other texts ===
As son of Prahlada: The Baudhayana Dharmasutra mentions the Asura Kapila is the son of Prahlada in the chapter laying rules for the Vaikhanasas. The section IV.16 of &quot;Baudhāyana Gṛhyasūtra&quot; mentions Kapila as the one who set up rules for ascetic life. Kapila is credited, in the Baudhayana Dharmasutra, with creating the four Ashrama orders: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and sanyassa, and suggesting that renouncer should never injure any living being in word, thought or deed. He is said to have made rules for renouncement of the sacrifices and rituals in the Vedas, and an ascetic&#x27;s attachment instead to the Brahman. In other Hindu texts such as the Mahabharata, Kapila is again the sage who argues against sacrifices, and for non-violence and an end to cruelty to animals, with the argument that if sacrifices benefited the animal, then logically the family who sacrifices would benefit by a similar death. According to Chaturvedi, in a study of inscriptions of Khajuraho temples, the early Samkhya philosophers were possibly disciples of female teachers.

=== Imagery in the Agamas ===
Kapila&#x27;s imagery is depicted with a beard, seated in &quot;padmāsana&quot; with closed eyes indicating &quot;dhyāna&quot;, with a &quot;jaṭā-maṇḍala&quot; around the head, showing high shoulders indicating he is greatly adept in controlling breath, draped in deer skin, wearing the yagñopavīta, with a &quot;kamaṇḍalu&quot; near him, with one hand placed in front of the crossed legs, and feet marked with lines resembling outline of a lotus. This Kapila is identified with Kapila the founder of Sāṅkhya system; while the Vaikhānasasāgama gives somewhat varying description. The Vaikhānasasāgama places Kapila as an āvaraņadēvāta and allocates the south-east corner of the first āvaraņa. As the embodiment of the Vedas his image is seated facing east with eight arms; of which four on the right should be in abhaya mudra, the other three should carry the Chakra, Khaḍga, Hala; one left hand is to rest on the hip in the &quot;kațyavarlambita&quot; pose and other three should carry the Ṡaṅkha, Pāśa and Daṇḍa.

=== Other descriptions ===
*The name Kapila is sometimes used as an epithet for Vasudeva with Vasudeva having incarnated in the place named Kapila.
*Pradyumna assumed the form of Kapila when he became free from desire of worldly influences.
*Kapila is as one of the seven Dikpalas with the other six being Dharma, Kala, Vasu, Vasuki, Ananta.
*The Jayakhya Samhita of 5th century AD alludes to the Chaturmukha Vishnu of Kashmir and mentions Vishnu with Varaha, Nrsimha and Kapila defeated the asuras who appeared before them in zoomorphic forms with Nrsimha and Varaha posited to be incarnations of Vishnu and Kapila respectively.
*In the Vamana Purana, the Yakshas were sired by Kapila with his consort Kesini who is from the Khasa class; though the epics attribute the origin of Yakshas to a cosmic egg or to the sage Pulastya; while other puranas posit Kashyapa as the progenitor of Yakshas with his consort Vishva or Khasha.
*In some puranas, Kapila is also mentioned as a female, a daughter of Khaśā and a Rākșasī, after whom came the name Kāpileya gaņa. In the Mahabharat, Kapila is a daughter of Daksha and having married Kashyapa gave birth to the Brahmanas, Kine, Gandharvas and Apsaras.
*Kapila being a great teacher also had gardening as a hobby focusing his time around the babool (Acacia) tree everywhere he lived.

=== Kapila Devahuti Samvada ===

Kapila-Devahuti Samvada is the basis of &quot;Samkhya Philosophy&quot;. Shri Krishna also mentioned this concept briefly to Arjun amidst their conversation during the Mahabharata war, which has been mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, called Samkhya Yog. for which Kapila is well known. Kapila-Devahuti Samvada which roughly translates to &quot;The Discussions between Kapila and Devahuti&quot;, touches topics on how to control oneself effectively and truly become the master of oneself. Kapila Devahuti Samvada is a text where Devahuti approaches Kapila with a dilemma. She mentions that she is fed up of satisfying her five senses. She states that all her life, she has been giving in to these senses. but they are never satisfied. Kapila explains the Samkhya philosophy to set her mind at ease and give her inner peace. This discussion is in the form of question and answers format. This has been mentioned in detail in the third canto of Shrimad Bhagavata Purana.

== Jainism ==
Kapila is mentioned in chapter VIII of the &quot; Uttaradhyayana-sutra&quot;, states Larson and Bhattacharya, where a discourse of poetical verses is titled as &quot;Kaviliyam&quot;, or &quot;Kapila&#x27;s verses&quot;.

The name Kapila appears in Jaina texts. For example, in the 12th century Hemacandra&#x27;s epic poem on Jain elders, Kapila appears as a Brahmin who converted to Jainism during the Nanda Empire era.
According to &quot;Jnatadharmakatha&quot;, Kapila is a contemporary of Krishna and the &quot;Vasudeva&quot; of &quot;Dhatakikhanda&quot;. The text further mentions that both of them blew their &quot;shankha&quot; (conch shell) together.

== Buddhism ==
Buddhists literature, such as the Jataka tales, state the Buddha is Kapila in one of his previous lives.

Scholars have long compared and associated the teachings of Kapila and Buddha. For example, Max Muller wrote (abridged),

Max Muller states the link between the more ancient Kapila&#x27;s teachings on Buddha can be overstated. This confusion is easy, states Muller, because Kapila&#x27;s first sutra in his classic Samkhya-sutra, &quot;the complete cessation of pain, which is of three kinds, is the highest aim of man&quot;, sounds like the natural inspiration for Buddha. However, adds Muller, the teachings on how to achieve this, by Kapila and by Buddha, are very different.

As Buddhist art often depicts Vedic deities, one can find art of both Narayana and Kapila as kings within a Buddhist temple, along with statues of Buddhist figures such as Amitabha, Maitreya, and Vairocana.

In Chinese Buddhism, the Buddha directed the Yaksha Kapila and fifteen daughters of Devas to become the patrons of China.

==Significance==
Kapila, the founder of Samkhya, has been a highly revered sage in various schools of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada (~500 CE), an Advaita Vedanta scholar, in his Bhasya called Kapila as one of the seven great sages along with Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, Asuri, Vodhu and Pancasikha. Patanjali, the Yoga scholar, in his &quot;Yogasutra-bhasya&quot; wrote Kapila to be the &quot;primal wise man, or knower&quot;. The Buddhist sources mention that the city of Kapilavastu is built in the honor of Kapila. It is in Kapilavastu that the Buddha is born; and, it is here he spent the first twenty-nine years of his life.

<doc id="583637" wikidata="Q3983972" url="?curid=583637" title="Simplicial approximation theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the simplicial approximation theorem is a foundational result for algebraic topology, guaranteeing that continuous mappings can be (by a slight deformation) approximated by ones that are piecewise of the simplest kind. It applies to mappings between spaces that are built up from simplices—that is, finite simplicial complexes. The general continuous mapping between such spaces can be represented approximately by the type of mapping that is (&quot;affine&quot;-) linear on each simplex into another simplex, at the cost (i) of sufficient barycentric subdivision of the simplices of the domain, and (ii) replacement of the actual mapping by a homotopic one.

This theorem was first proved by L.E.J. Brouwer, by use of the Lebesgue covering theorem (a result based on compactness). It served to put the homology theory of the time—the first decade of the twentieth century—on a rigorous basis, since it showed that the topological effect (on homology groups) of continuous mappings could in a given case be expressed in a finitary way. This must be seen against the background of a realisation at the time that continuity was in general compatible with the pathological, in some other areas. This initiated, one could say, the era of combinatorial topology.

There is a further simplicial approximation theorem for homotopies, stating that a homotopy between continuous mappings can likewise be approximated by a combinatorial version.

==Formal statement of the theorem==

Let formula_1 and formula_2 be two simplicial complexes. A simplicial mapping formula_3 is called a simplicial approximation of a continuous function formula_4 if for every point formula_5, formula_6 belongs to the minimal closed simplex of formula_2 containing the point formula_8. If formula_9 is a simplicial approximation to a continuous map formula_10, then the geometric realization of formula_9, formula_12 is necessarily homotopic to formula_10.

The simplicial approximation theorem states that given any continuous map formula_4 there exists a natural number formula_15 such that for all formula_16 there exists a simplicial approximation formula_17 to formula_10 (where formula_19 denotes the barycentric subdivision of formula_1, and formula_21 denotes the result of applying barycentric subdivision formula_22 times.), in other words, if formula_23 and formula_24 are simplicial complexes and formula_25 is a continuous function, then there is a subdivision formula_26 of formula_23 and a simplicial map formula_28 which is homotopic to formula_29. Moreover, if formula_30 is a positive continuous map, then there are subdivisions formula_31 of formula_32 and a simplicial map formula_33 such that formula_34 is formula_35-homotopic to formula_29; that is, there is a homotopy formula_37 from formula_29 to formula_34 such that formula_40 for all formula_41. So, we may consider the simplicial approximation theorem as a piecewise linear analog of Whitney approximation theorem.

<doc id="583640" wikidata="Q6022530" url="?curid=583640" title="Indian giver">
<text>&quot;Indian giver&quot; is a pejorative expression used to describe a person who gives a &quot;gift&quot; and later wants it back or who expects something of equivalent worth in return for the item. It is based on cultural misunderstandings that took place between the early European colonists and the Indigenous people with whom they traded. Often, the Europeans viewed an exchange of items as gifts and believed that they owed nothing in return to the Indigenous people. On the other hand, the Indigenous people saw the exchange as a form of trade or equal exchange and so they had differing expectations of their guests.

The phrase is used to describe a negative act or shady business dealings, and is considered offensive to many Indigenous American people.

==Etymology==
The phrase originated, according to the researcher David Wilton, in a cultural misunderstanding that arose when European settlers first encountered Native Americans after the former had arrived in North America in the 15th century. The Europeans thought that they were receiving gifts from Native Americans, but the Native Americans believed that they were engaging in what was known to Europeans as bartering. That resulted in the Native Americans finding European behaviour ungenerous and insulting.

==Usage==
The phrase was first noted in 1765 by Thomas Hutchinson, who characterized an Indian gift as &quot;a present for which an equivalent return is expected&quot;, which suggests that the phrase originally referred to a simple exchange of gifts. In 1860, however, in John Russell Bartlett&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Americanisms&quot;, Bartlett said that the phrase was being used by children in New York to mean &quot;one who gives a present and then takes it back&quot;. 

In 1969, American bubblegum pop band 1910 Fruitgum Company published the album &quot;Indian Giver&quot;. The titular song peaked at #5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and #1 in Canada.

As recently as 1979, the phrase was used in mainstream media publications, but in the 1997 book &quot;The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States&quot;, the writer and editor Philip H. Herbst says that although the phrase is often used innocently by children, it may be interpreted as offensive, and &quot;The Copyeditor&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1999) describes it as objectionable.

Author David Wilton argues in his 2004 book &quot;Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends&quot; that the concept of an &quot;Indian gift&quot; arose when white settlers misinterpreted the Native American concept of bartering:

<doc id="583650" wikidata="Q686238" url="?curid=583650" title="Chienbäse">
<text>is a Fasnacht tradition of Liestal, Basel-Landschaft, Switzerland.

On the Sunday night after Ash Wednesday, the night before the &quot;Morgestraich&quot; in Basel city, a procession begins of people carrying burning bundles of pinewood chips (called , the Alemannic German for &quot;pinewood besom&quot;) through the medieval town center along the &quot;Rathausstrasse&quot;, entering through the city gate from the south. In more recent decades the Chienbäse have been augmented with carts carrying bonfires, with flames often reaching as high as the houses. The parade is attended by thousands of spectators from Switzerland as well as from countries around the globe, closely packed on either side of the small street.

The origins of the custom are open to speculation. Often identified as a &quot;pagan spring ritual&quot; due to the archaic qualities of the fire spectacle, the earliest report of a procession of torch bearers dates to 1869. A tradition of bonfires before Lent has a longer history of attestation, dating from at least the 16th century.

<text>In mathematics, the barycentric subdivision is a standard way to subdivide a given simplex into smaller ones. Its extension to simplicial complexes is a canonical method to refining them. Therefore, the barycentric subdivision is an important tool in algebraic topology.

== Motivation ==
The barycentric subdivision is an operation on simplicial complexes. In algebraic topology it is sometimes useful to replace the original spaces with simplicial complexes via triangulations: This substitution allows one to assign combinatorial invariants such as the Euler characteristic to the spaces. One can ask whether there is an analogous way to replace the continuous functions defined on the topological spaces with functions that are linear on the simplices and homotopic to the original maps (see also simplicial approximation). In general, such an assignment requires a refinement of the given complex, meaning that one replaces larger simplices with a union of smaller simplices. A standard way to carry out such a refinement is the barycentric subdivision. Moreover, barycentric subdivision induces maps on homology groups and is helpful for computational concerns, see Excision and the Mayer–Vietoris sequence.

== Definition ==

=== Subdivision of simplicial complexes ===
Let formula_1 be a geometric simplicial complex. A complex formula_2 is said to be a subdivision of formula_3 if

* each simplex of formula_2 is contained in a simplex of formula_3
* each simplex of formula_3 is a finite union of simplices of formula_2

These conditions imply that formula_3 and formula_2 equal as sets and as topological spaces, only the simplicial structure changes.
=== Barycentric subdivision of a simplex ===
For a simplex formula_10 spanned by points formula_11, the barycenter is defined to be the point formula_12 . To define the subdivision, we will consider a simplex as a simplicial complex that contains only one simplex of maximal dimension, namely the simplex itself. The barycentric subdivision of a simplex can be defined inductively by its dimension.

For points, i.e. simplices of dimension 0, the barycentric subdivision is defined as the point itself.

Suppose then for a simplex formula_10 of dimension formula_14 that its faces formula_15 of dimension formula_16 are already divided. Therefore, there exist simplices formula_17 covering formula_18. The barycentric subdivision is then defined to be the geometric simplicial complex whose maximal simplices of dimension formula_14 are each a convex hulls of formula_20 for one pair formula_21 for some formula_22, so there will be formula_23 simplices covering formula_10.

One can generalize the subdivision for simplicial complexes whose simplices are not all contained in a single simplex of maximal dimension, i.e. simplicial complexes that do not correspond geometrically to one simplex. This can be done by effectuating the steps described above simultaneously for every simplex of maximal dimension. The induction will then be based on the formula_14-th skeleton of the simplicial complex. It allows effectuating the subdivision more than once.

===Barycentric subdivision of a convex polytope===
The operation of barycentric subdivision can be applied to any convex polytope of any dimension, producing another convex polytope of the same dimension. In this version of barycentric subdivision, it is not necessary for the polytope to form a simplicial complex: it can have faces that are not simplices. This is the dual operation to omnitruncation. The vertices of the barycentric subdivision correspond to the faces of all dimensions of the original polytope. Two vertices are adjacent in the barycentric subdivision when they correspond to two faces of different dimensions with the lower-dimensional face included in the higher-dimensional face. The facets of the barycentric subdivision are simplices, corresponding to the flags of the original polytope.

For instance, the barycentric subdivision of a cube, or of a regular octahedron, is the disdyakis dodecahedron. The degree-6, degree-4, and degree-8 vertices of the disdyakis dodecahedron correspond to the vertices, edges, and square facets of the cube, respectively.

== Properties ==

=== Mesh ===
Let formula_26 a simplex and define formula_27. One way to measure the mesh of a geometric, simplicial complex is to take the maximal diameter of the simplices contained in the complex. Let formula_28 be an formula_14- dimensional simplex that comes from the covering of formula_10 obtained by the barycentric subdivision. Then, the following estimation holds:

formula_31. Therefore, by applying barycentric subdivision sufficiently often, the largest edge can be made as small as desired.

=== Homology ===
For some statements in homology-theory one wishes to replace simplicial complexes by a subdivision. On the level of simplicial homology groups one requires a map from the homology-group of the original simplicial complex to the groups of the subdivided complex. Indeed it can be shown that for any subdivision formula_32 of a finite simplicial complex formula_33 there is a unique sequence of maps between the homology groups formula_34 such that for each formula_35 in formula_36 the maps fulfills formula_37 and such that the maps induces endomorphisms of chain complexes. Moreover, the induced map is an isomorphism: Subdivision does not change the homology of the complex.

To compute the singular homology groups of a topological space formula_38 one considers continuous functions formula_39 where formula_40 denotes the formula_14-dimensional-standard-simplex. In an analogous way as described for simplicial homology groups, barycentric subdivision can be interpreted as an endomorphism of singular chain complexes. Here again, there exists a subdivision operator formula_42 sending a chain formula_43 to a linear combination formula_44 where the sum runs over all simplices formula_45 that appear in the covering of formula_10 by barycentric subdivision, and formula_47 for all of such formula_45. This map also induces an endomorphism of chain complexes.

== Applications ==
The barycentric subdivision can be applied on whole simplicial complexes as in the simplicial approximation theorem or it can be used to subdivide geometric simplices. Therefore it is crucial for statements in singular homology theory, see Mayer–Vietoris sequence and excision.

=== Simplicial approximation ===
Let formula_33, formula_50 be abstract simplicial complexes above sets formula_51, formula_52. A simplicial map is a function formula_53 which maps each simplex in formula_33 onto a simplex in formula_50. By affin-linear extension on the simplices, formula_56 induces a map between the geometric realizations of the complexes. Each point in a geometric complex lies in the inner of exactly one simplex, its &quot;support.&quot; Consider now a &quot;continuous&quot; map formula_57&quot;.&quot; A simplicial map formula_58 is said to be a &quot;simplicial approximation&quot; of formula_59 if and only if each formula_60 is mapped by formula_61 onto the support of formula_62 in formula_50. If such an approximation exists, one can construct a homotopy formula_64 transforming formula_56 into formula_61 by defining it on each simplex; there, it always exists, because simplices are contractible.

The simplicial approximation theorem guarantees for every continuous function formula_53 the existence of a simplicial approximation at least after refinement of formula_33, for instance by replacing formula_33 by its iterated barycentric subdivision. The theorem plays an important role for certain statements in algebraic topology in order to reduce the behavior of continuous maps on those of simplicial maps, as for instance in &quot;Lefschetz&#x27;s fixed-point theorem.&quot;

==== Lefschetz&#x27;s fixed-point theorem ====
The &quot;Lefschetz number&quot; is a useful tool to find out whether a continuous function admits fixed-points. This data is computed as follows: Suppose that formula_38 and formula_71 are topological spaces that admit finite triangulations. A continuous map formula_72 induces homomorphisms formula_73 between its simplicial homology groups with coefficients in a field formula_74. These are linear maps between formula_75- vectorspaces, so their trace formula_76 can be determined and their alternating sum

formula_77

is called the &quot;Lefschetz number&quot; of formula_59. If formula_79, this number is the Euler characteristic of formula_74. The fixpoint theorem states that whenever formula_81, formula_59 has a fixed-point. In the proof this is first shown only for simplicial maps and then generalized for any continuous functions via the approximation theorem.

Now, Brouwer&#x27;s fixpoint theorem is a special case of this statement. Let formula_83 is an endomorphism of the unit-ball. For formula_84 all its homology groups formula_85 vanish, and formula_86 is always the identity, so formula_87, so formula_59 has a fixpoint.

=== Mayer–Vietoris sequence ===
The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is often used to compute singular homology groups and gives rise to inductive arguments in topology. The related statement can be formulated as follows:

Let formula_89 an open cover of the topological space formula_38 .

There is an exact sequence

: formula_91
: formula_92

where we consider singular homology groups, formula_93 are embeddings and formula_94 denotes the direct sum of abelian groups.

For the construction of singular homology groups one considers continuous maps defined on the standard simplex formula_43. An obstacle in the proof of the theorem are maps formula_96 such that their image is nor contained in formula_97 neither in formula_98. This can be fixed using the subdivision operator: By considering the images of such maps as the sum of images of smaller simplices, lying in formula_97 or formula_98 one can show that the inclusion formula_101 induces an isomorphism on homology which is needed to compare the homology groups.

=== Excision ===
Excision can be used to determine relative homology groups. It allows in certain cases to forget about subsets of topological spaces for their homology groups and therefore simplifies their computation:

Let formula_38 be a topological space and let formula_103 be subsets, where formula_104 is closed such that formula_105. Then the inclusion formula_106 induces an isomorphism formula_107 for all formula_108

Again, in singular homology, maps formula_43 may appear such that their image is not part of the subsets mentioned in the theorem. Analogously those can be understood as a sum of images of smaller simplices obtained by the barycentric subdivision.

<text>14 Shades of Grey is the fourth studio album by American rock band Staind, released on May 20, 2003. The album continues the post-grunge sound as seen on the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Break the Cycle&quot;, but the songs on &quot;14 Shades of Grey&quot; have fewer pop hooks, focusing more on frontman Aaron Lewis&#x27;s emotions. It is the band&#x27;s last album to be released from Elektra Records.

The album featured four singles and debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first week sales of 220,000 copies. By July 2003, &quot;14 Shades of Grey&quot; had been certified Gold then later Platinum.

==Background==
After finishing their tour schedule, Staind allowed time for Lewis and his wife to conceive their first child and adjust to being parents for a few months. The band then took about five weeks to write new songs before they began recording in Los Angeles, including a week developing the songs at producer Josh Abraham&#x27;s house. Guitarist Mike Mushok noted it as the first time Staind has actually written in the studio.

In January 2003, Staind planned on a May 6 release date for their untitled fourth album. This date persisted into March during which an album title was announced. However, this would have to be delayed a few weeks.

Aaron Lewis elaborated on the lighter direction of &quot;14 Shades of Grey&quot;:
Guitarist Mike Mushok described the album title in a 2003 interview:
The song &quot;Layne&quot; is a tribute to Layne Staley, the late Alice in Chains singer. The song &quot;Zoe Jane&quot; honors Aaron Lewis&#x27; firstborn daughter. Some shots of Zoe Jane are featured in the video for &quot;So Far Away&quot;.

==Release==
First editions of the album included a limited edition bonus DVD featuring home videos and footage of the band from their early years to the present, along with album lyrics and new band photos. For a time, fans could use the CD to download a bonus acoustic song &quot;Let it Out&quot; from the Staind website, but the page was later removed. The song was later included on the deluxe edition of the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Chapter V&quot;.

A DVD-Audio edition of the album was also released, featuring a 5.1 surround sound version of the album, at high resolution (96 kHz/24-bit).

==Touring and promotion==
The single &quot;Price to Play&quot; was released in early anticipation of the album&#x27;s debut. Three more singles were released over the next several months with accompanying music videos.

Staind supported &quot;14 Shades of Grey&quot; with a series of in-store appearances followed by free club performances. They also performed with Label mates Cold during the summer of 2003. Concert setlists incorporated songs from the band&#x27;s previous two albums.

==Reception==
The album received mainly mixed reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 41, based on 10 reviews.

<text>A Christian Science practitioner is an individual who prays for others according to the teachings of Christian Science. Treatment is non-medical, rather it is based on the Bible and the Christian Science textbook, &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot; (1875) by Mary Baker Eddy (1821–1910), who said she discovered Christian Science in 1866 and founded the Christian Science church in 1879. According to the church, Christian Science practitioners address physical conditions, as well as relationship or financial difficulties and any other problem or crisis.
Practitioners are either &quot;listed&quot; or &quot;unlisted,&quot; a designation that refers to a form of international accreditation maintained by The Mother Church, in Boston, Massachusetts. &quot;Listed&quot; practitioners are included in the directory of Christian Science practitioners on the church website, and printed in the &quot;Christian Science Journal&quot;.

== Practice and ethics ==
Christian Science practitioners are those who devote their full time to prayer for others. Regarding prayer in Christian Science, sometimes called &quot;treatment&quot; when focused on a specific issue or problem, Mary Baker Eddy wrote: &quot;The prayer that reforms the sinner and heals the sick is an absolute faith that all things are possible to God, — a spiritual understanding of Him, an unselfed love.&quot; Christian Scientists see practitioners as following in the footsteps of Jesus&#x27; disciples in order to &quot;reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing.&quot; The work of a Christian Science practitioner, according to John M. Tutt, a medical doctor who left medicine and became a Christian Science practitioner, is that of a &quot;helper&quot;; and the patient is encouraged to pray along with the practitioner to &quot;know the truth&quot; when possible. However, Christian Scientists note that the patient does not need to pray or even believe in Christian Science or have any religious faith at all in order to be healed by a practitioner&#x27;s prayer. Practitioners are also not confined to praying about sickness, but pray for people regarding any type of difficulty such as financial or relationship problems.

Christian Scientists do not consider healing to be the primary purpose of Christian Science, but rather a deeper sense of God that they say comes with healing. However, Charles S. Braden notes that most Christian Scientists probably originally came to the religion for healing. Critics of Christian Science have ridiculed the idea of &quot;absent treatment&quot;, where a practitioner prays for a patient who is not physically present with the practitioner, and sometimes compared it to witchcraft; but Christian Scientists counter that Jesus did the same thing, citing the healing the centurion&#x27;s servant in the Gospel of Matthew.

Practitioners are required to maintain the confidentiality of their patients&#x27; private communications. In cases where the patient&#x27;s recovery is &quot;chronic&quot; or if the practitioner fails to bring about a recovery, he is required to lower the bill. Combining Christian Science treatment with medical treatment is not recommended by &quot;Science and Health&quot; and traditionally, practitioners have withdrawn from cases where the patient undertook medical treatment, except where it was clear this was against the patient&#x27;s will. As noted by Robert Peel, Christian Scientists are &quot;not &#x27;against doctors&#x27;... [but] experience has shown that any attempt to combine Christian Science with medical treatment is likely to lessen the efficacy of each, since they start from exactly opposite premises.&quot; Some practitioners no longer give up such cases, although they may change the nature of their prayer, a loosening of standards precipitated by several well-publicized deaths under Christian Science treatment, including those of children.

== System of accreditation ==
Any student of Christian Science may take patients, but only those &quot;listed&quot; as practitioners in the worldwide directory published in &quot;The Christian Science Journal&quot; and on the Christian Science website are regarded by the church as experienced healers. The church writes that, to become listed, applicants are interviewed, and must provide references from &quot;three patients who can confirm a complete healing through [the applicant&#x27;s] prayerful treatment.&quot; Applicants must also have taken &quot;primary class&quot; instruction by an &quot;authorized teacher of Christian Science&quot; under the aegis of the Christian Science Board of Education, as stipulated in the &quot;Manual of The Mother Church&quot;, which governs all activities of the church.

==Class instruction and Christian Science teachers==
===Primary class instruction===
Primary class is a two-week course that is open to anyone and is a &quot;comprehensive study of the nature of God and man&quot;, according to DeWitt John, a Christian Science teacher. The class follows the chapter &quot;Recapitulation&quot; from &quot;Science and Health&quot;, using the Bible and all Eddy&#x27;s published works as research and reference to explain the chapter. Following hours of class time, students are given hours of homework, both reading and written assignments. John writes, &quot;The instruction is so deep and absorbing that it often changes one&#x27;s outlook and leaves an impression that lasts a lifetime. ... [It] has special impact because of its systematic and thorough character and because it is based upon years of actual experience on the part of the teacher in the practice of Christian Science healing.&quot; Severin E. Simonsen, a Methodist minister converted to Christian Science, wrote, &quot;I have sat for months in classrooms listening to learned professors and able teachers, but I never supposed it to be possible for any human being to teach and unfold to his students, in the short space of two weeks, all that [our teacher] imparted to us.&quot; Students completing the course receive the certificate &quot;C.S.&quot; and are referred to as having been &quot;class taught&quot;.

Teachers are prohibited from soliciting students; rather, students apply to a teacher for primary class, which is taken just once in life, except in the event that a teacher&#x27;s credentials are withdrawn. Each teacher maintains an &quot;association&quot; of students, which grows in size over the years. Each teacher meets annually with the entire association for an all-day lecture designed to renew and further the students&#x27; understanding and practice of Christian Science.

===Christian Science teachers (C.S.B.)===
An authorized teacher is one who, having had primary class instruction and a minimum of three years&#x27; experience as a practitioner, has completed the normal course. Normal class instruction is held once every three years and is limited to 30 pupils. Primary class is held once a year by each teacher and is also limited to 30. According to the &quot;Manual&quot;, those who complete the normal class receive the certificate &quot;C.S.B.&quot; Tuition for both classes is fixed by the &quot;Manual&quot; at $100.

Primary class instruction is held all over the world, wherever authorized teachers of Christian Science live or decide to teach; the normal class is held by the Christian Science Board of Education in Boston, Massachusetts. The Board selects a teacher, who usually teaches the normal class just once in a lifetime, and is not identified until several weeks after the class has ended.

== In the United States ==
In the United States, Christian Science practitioners are legally defined as health care providers. Despite the non-medical nature of their practice, Christian Science practitioners were aggressively prosecuted in the late 19th century by newly established state medical societies across the United States. Most state courts dismissed these actions because the courts ruled that they did not practice medicine.
