<text>Marion Anne Perrine &quot;Marine&quot; Le Pen (; born 5 August 1968) is a French lawyer and politician who ran for the French presidency in 2012, 2017, and 2022. A member of the far-right National Rally (RN; previously the National Front, FN), she served as its president from 2011 to 2021. She has been the member of the National Assembly for the 11th constituency of Pas-de-Calais since 2017. Le Pen has served as parliamentary party leader of the National Rally in the Assembly since June 2022.

Le Pen is the youngest daughter of former party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and the aunt of former FN MP Marion Maréchal. Le Pen joined the FN in 1986. She was elected as a regional councillor of Nord-Pas-de-Calais (1998–2004; 2010–2015), Île-de-France (2004–2010) and Hauts-de-France (2015–2021), a Member of European Parliament (2004–2017), as well as a municipal councillor of Hénin-Beaumont (2008–2011). She won the leadership of the FN in 2011, with 67.6% of the vote, defeating Bruno Gollnisch and succeeding her father, who had been president of the party since he founded it in 1972. In 2012, she placed third in the presidential election with 17.9% of the vote, behind François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. She launched a second bid for the presidency at the 2017 election. She finished second in the first round of the election with 21.3% of the vote and faced Emmanuel Macron of centrist party En Marche! in the second round of voting. On 7 May 2017, she conceded after receiving approximately 33.9% of the vote in the second round. In 2020, she announced her third candidacy for the presidency in the 2022 election. She came second in the first round of the election with 23.2% of the votes, thus qualifying her for the second round against Macron, losing in the second round after receiving 41.5% of the votes.

Le Pen has led a movement of &quot;de-demonisation of the National Front&quot; to soften its image, including limited expulsion of members accused of racism, antisemitism or Pétainism. She expelled her father from the party in August 2015, after he made fresh controversial statements. While liberalizing some political positions of the party by revoking its opposition to same-sex partnerships, its opposition to unconditional abortions, and its support for the death penalty, Le Pen still advocates many of the same historical policies of her party, with particular focus on strong anti-immigration, nationalist and protectionist measures. She is supportive of economic nationalism, favoring an interventionist role of government, and is opposed to globalization and multiculturalism. Le Pen supports limiting immigration and banning ritual slaughter. She has made supportive comments of Vladimir Putin and Russia in the past, advocating closer cooperation before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine; she strongly condemned the war in Ukraine, but stated Russia could become &quot;an ally of France again&quot; if it ends. She has supported Israel during the Israel–Hamas war.

&quot;Time&quot; named Le Pen one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2015. In 2016, &quot;Politico&quot; named her the second-most influential MEP in the European Parliament, after President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz. In January 2024, after months of rising polling numbers, and for the first time ever, Le Pen became the most popular politician in France according to a Verian-Epoka for &quot;Le Figaro Magazine&quot;.
==Early life and education==
===Childhood===
Marion Anne Perrine Le Pen was born on 5 August 1968 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, the youngest of three daughters of Jean-Marie Le Pen, a Breton politician and former paratrooper, and his first wife, Pierrette Le Pen. She was baptized on 25 April 1969 at La Madeleine Church in Paris. Her godfather was Henri Botey, a relative of her father.

Le Pen has two sisters: Yann and Marie-Caroline. In 1976, when Marine was eight, a bomb meant for her father exploded in the stairwell outside the family&#x27;s apartment as they slept. The blast ripped a hole in the outside wall of the building, but Marine, her two older sisters and their parents were unharmed.

She was a student at the Lycée Florent Schmitt in Saint-Cloud. Her mother left the family in 1984 when Marine was 16. Le Pen wrote in her autobiography that the effect was &quot;the most awful, cruel, crushing of pains of the heart: my mother did not love me.&quot; Her parents divorced in 1987.

===Legal studies and work===
Le Pen studied law at Panthéon-Assas University, graduating with a Master of Laws in 1991 and a Master of Advanced Studies (DEA) in criminal law in 1992. Registered at the Paris bar association, she worked as a lawyer for six years (1992–1998), appearing regularly before the criminal chamber of the 23rd district court of Paris which judges immediate appearances, and often acting as a public defender. She was a member of the Paris Bar until 1998, when she joined the legal department of the National Front.

===Personal life===
In 1995, Le Pen married Franck Chauffroy, a business executive who worked for the National Front. She has three children with Chauffroy (Jehanne, Louis, and Mathilde). After her divorce from Chauffroy in 2000, she married Eric Lorio in 2002, the former national secretary of the National Front and a former adviser to the Regional election in Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The couple divorced in 2006.

From 2009 until 2019, she was in a relationship with Louis Aliot, who is of ethnic French Pied-Noir and Algerian Jewish heritage. He was the National Front general secretary from 2005 to 2010, then the National Front vice president. She has lived in La Celle-Saint-Cloud with her three children since September 2014. She has an apartment in Hénin-Beaumont and owns a house with Aliot in Millas.

Le Pen has described herself as a non-practising Catholic. Her children were baptised by a priest of the Society of Saint Pius X (FSSPX) in the Church of Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet.

==Early political career==
===1986–2010: Rise within the National Front===
Marine Le Pen joined the FN in 1986, at the age of 18. She acquired her first political mandate in 1998 when she was elected a Regional Councillor for Nord-Pas-de-Calais. In the same year, she joined the FN&#x27;s juridical branch, which she led until 2003.

In 2000, she became president of &quot;Generations Le Pen&quot;, a loose association close to the party which aimed at &quot;&quot;de-demonizing&quot; the Front National&quot;. She became a member the FN Executive Committee () in 2000, and vice-president of the FN in 2003. In 2006, she managed the presidential campaign of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. She became one of the two executive vice-presidents of the FN in 2007, with responsibility for training, communication and publicity.

In the 2007 parliamentary election, she contested Pas-de-Calais&#x27; 14th constituency but came second behind incumbent Socialist MP Albert Facon.

===2010–11: Leadership campaign===
Early in 2010, Le Pen expressed her intention to run for leader of the FN, saying that she hoped to make the party &quot;a big popular party that addresses itself not only to the electorate on the right but to all the French people&quot;.

On 3 September 2010, she launched her leadership campaign at Cuers, Var. During a meeting in Paris on 14 November 2010, she said that her goal was &quot;not only to assemble our political family. It consists of shaping the Front National as the center of grouping of the whole French people&quot;, adding that in her view the FN leader should be the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2012 presidential election. She spent four months campaigning for the FN leadership, holding meetings with FN members in 51 departments. All the other departments were visited by one of her official supporters. During her final meeting of the campaign in Hénin-Beaumont on 19 December 2010, she claimed that the FN would present the real debate of the next presidential campaign. Her candidacy was endorsed by a majority of senior figures in the party, including her father.

On several occasions during her campaign she ruled out any political alliance with the Union for a Popular Movement. She also distanced herself from some of Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s most controversial statements, such as those relating to war crimes, which was reported in the media as attempts to improve the party&#x27;s image. While her father had attracted controversy by saying that the mass murder of Jews in gas chambers during the Holocaust was &quot;a detail of the history of World War II&quot;, she described genocide as &quot;the height of barbarism&quot;.

In December 2010 and early January 2011, FN members voted by post to elect their new president and the members of the central committee. The party held a congress at Tours on 15–16 January. On 16 January 2011, Marine Le Pen was elected as the new president of the FN, with 67.65% of the vote (11,546 votes to 5,522 for Bruno Gollnisch), and Jean-Marie Le Pen became honorary chairman.

=== Muslim occupation comment ===
Marine Le Pen received substantial media attention during the campaign as a result of comments, made during a speech to party members in Lyon on 10 December 2010, in which she compared the use of public streets and squares in French cities (in particular rue Myrha in the 18th arrondissement of Paris) for Muslim prayers with the Nazi occupation of France. She said:
Her comments were much criticised. Government spokesman François Baroin characterized her remarks as racist and xenophobic. The Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), the French Council of Muslim Faith (CFCM) and the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) condemned her statement, and groups including MRAP (Movement Against Racism and for Friendship between Peoples) and the French Human Rights League (LDH) declared their intention to lodge a formal complaint. The imam of the Great Mosque of Paris and former president of the CFCM, Dalil Boubakeur, said that, while her parallel was questionable and to be condemned, she had asked a valid question.

Le Pen&#x27;s partner Louis Aliot, a member of the FN&#x27;s Executive Committee, criticized &quot;the attempted manipulation of opinion by communitarian groups and those really responsible for the current situation in France&quot;. On 13 December 2010, Le Pen reasserted her statement during a press conference at the FN headquarters in Nanterre. After Jean-François Kahn&#x27;s comments on BFM TV on 13 December 2010, she accused the Élysée Palace of organising &quot;state manipulation&quot; with the intention of demonizing her in public opinion. On 15 December 2015, a Lyon court acquitted her of &quot;inciting hatred&quot;, ruling that her statement &quot;did not target all of the Muslim community&quot; and was protected &quot;as a part of freedom of expression&quot;.

== Leadership of the National Front/National Rally (2011–2022) ==

=== Rebranding of the National Front ===
Le Pen has pursued a policy of &quot;de-demonisation&quot; of her party, to reform its image away from the extremism associated with her father, the former leader of the party and to increase the appeal of the party to voters. This has included policy reform and personnel replacement, including the expulsion of her own father from the party in 2015. Measures aimed at de-demonisation have included dropping all references to World War II or to the French colonial wars, which is often looked on as a generation gap. and distancing herself from her father&#x27;s views.

Bernard-Henri Lévy, a strong opponent of the FN, described Le Pen&#x27;s leadership of it as &quot;far-right with a human face&quot;. The measures have also attracted criticism from former allies as making the party too mainstream, abandoning long-held policies and ignoring grassroots support.

In a 2010 RTL interview, Le Pen stated that her strategy was not about changing the FN&#x27;s program but about showing it as it really is, instead of the image given to it by the media in the previous decades. The media and her political adversaries are accused of spreading an &quot;unfair, wrong and caricatural&quot; image of the National Front. She refuses the qualification of far-right or extreme-right, considering it a pejorative term: &quot;How am I party of the extreme right? ... I don&#x27;t think that our propositions are extreme propositions, whatever the subject&quot;.

In 2014, the American magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; mentioned her, along with four other French people, in its list of the 100 global thinkers of the year, underlining the way she &quot;renovated the image&quot; of her party, which had become a model for other right-wing parties in Europe after her success in the European elections. At a European level, she stopped the alliance built by her father with some right-wing extremist parties and refused to be part of a group with the radical Jobbik or the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn. Her transnational allies share the fact that they have officially condemned antisemitism, accepted a more liberal approach toward social matters, and are sometimes pro-Israel such as the Dutch PVV. French historian Nicolas Lebourg concluded that she is looked upon as a compass for them to follow while maintaining local particularities.

While other European populists embraced Donald Trump&#x27;s candidacy in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, she said only, &quot;For France, anything is better than Hillary Clinton&quot;. However, on 8 November 2016, she posted a tweet congratulating Trump on his election.

Her social program and her support of SYRIZA in the 2015 Greek general elections led Nicolas Sarkozy to declare her a far-left politician sharing some of Jean-Luc Mélenchon&#x27;s propositions. President François Hollande said she was talking &quot;like a leaflet of the Communist Party&quot;. Éric Zemmour, then known as a journalist for the conservative newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, wrote during the 2012 presidential election that the FN had become a left-wing party under the influence of adviser Florian Philippot. She has also relaxed some political positions of the party, advocating for civil unions for same-sex couples instead of her party&#x27;s previous opposition to legal recognition of same-sex partnerships, accepting current abortion laws, and withdrawing the restitution of the death penalty from her platform.

Despite Le Pen&#x27;s attempts to make the National Front more palatable to the international community, the party and Le Pen herself continue to attract criticism: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she &quot;will contribute to make other political forces stronger than the National Front&quot;; Israel still holds a negative opinion of her party; and former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage – himself a frequent critic of Islam and immigration – has said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never said a bad word about Marine Le Pen; I&#x27;ve never said a good word about her party&quot;.

=== First steps as a New leader (2011) ===

As a president of the Front National, Marine Le Pen currently sits as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member among the FN Executive Office (8 members), the Executive Committee (42 members) and the Central Committee (3 &quot;ex officio&quot; members, 100 elected members, 20 co-opted members).

During her opening speech in Tours on 16 January 2011, she advocated to &quot;restore the political framework of the national community&quot; and to implement the direct democracy which enables the &quot;civic responsibility and the collective tie&quot; thanks to the participation of public-spirited citizens for the decisions. The predominant political theme was the uncompromising defence of a protective and efficient state, which favours secularism, prosperity and liberties. She also denounced the &quot;Europe of Brussels&quot; which &quot;everywhere imposed the destructive principles of ultra-liberalism and free trade, at the expense of public utilities, employment, social equity and even our economic growth which became within twenty years the weakest of the world&quot;. After the traditional Joan of Arc march and Labour Day march in Paris on 1 May 2011, she gave her first speech in front of 3,000 supporters.

On 10 and 11 September 2011, she made her political comeback with the title &quot;the voice of people, the spirit of France&quot; in the convention center of Acropolis in Nice. During her closing speech she addressed immigration, insecurity, the economic and social situation, reindustrialization and &#x27;strong state&#x27;. During a demonstration held in front of the Senate on 8 December 2011, she expressed in a speech her &quot;firm and absolute opposition&quot; to the right of foreigners to vote. She regularly held thematic press conferences and interventions on varied issues in French, European and international politics.

=== First presidential candidacy (2011–2012) ===
On 16 May 2011, Marine Le Pen&#x27;s presidential candidacy was unanimously approved by the FN Executive Committee. On 10 and 11 September 2011, she launched her presidential campaign in Nice. On 6 October 2011, she held a press conference to introduce the members of her presidential campaign team.

In a speech in Paris on 19 November 2011, Le Pen presented the main themes of her presidential campaign: sovereignty of the people and democracy, Europe, re-industrialisation and a strong state, family and education, immigration and assimilation versus communitarianism, geopolitics and international politics. At a press conference on 12 January 2012, she presented a detailed assessment of her presidential project, and a plan to reduce France&#x27;s debt. At another press conference on 1 February 2012, she outlined her policies for the overseas departments and territories of France. Many observers noted her tendency to focus on economic and social issues such as globalization and delocalisations, rather than immigration or law and order, which had until then been the central issues for the FN. On 11 December 2011, she held her first campaign meeting in Metz, and from early January to mid-April 2012, she held similar meetings each week in the major French cities. On 17 April 2012, between 6,000 and 7,000 people participated part in her final campaign meeting, held at the Zenith in Paris.

On 13 March 2012, she announced that she had collected the 500 signatures required to take part in the presidential election. On 19 March 2012, the Constitutional Council approved her candidacy, and those of nine competitors. On 22 April 2012, she polled 17.90% (6,421,426 votes) in the first round, finishing in third position behind François Hollande and incumbent president Nicolas Sarkozy. She achieved better results, in both percentage vote-share and number of votes, than her father had in the 2002 presidential election (16.86%, 4,804,772 votes in the first round; 17.79%, 5,525,034 votes in the run-off).

Le Pen polled first in Gard (25.51%, 106,646 votes), with Sarkozy and Hollande polling 24.86% (103,927 votes) and 24.11% (100,778 votes) respectively. She also came first in her municipal stronghold of Hénin-Beaumont (35.48%, 4,924 votes), where Hollande and Sarkozy polled 26.82% (3,723 votes) and 15.76% (2,187 votes) respectively. She achieved her highest results east of the line from Le Havre in the north to Perpignan in the south, and conversely she won fewer votes in western France, especially cities such as Paris, overseas and among French citizens living abroad (5.95%, 23,995 votes). However, she polled well in two rural departments in western France: Orne (20.00%, 34,757 votes) and Sarthe (19.17%, 62,516 votes).

Her highest regional result was in Picardy (25.03%, 266,041 votes), her highest departmental result in Vaucluse (27.03%, 84,585 votes), and her highest overseas result in Saint Pierre and Miquelon (15.81%, 416 votes).

She achieved her lowest regional result in Île-de-France (12.28%, 655,926 votes), her lowest departmental result in Paris (6.20%, 61,503 votes), and her lowest overseas result in Wallis and Futuna (2.37%, 152 votes).

French sociologist Sylvain Crépon, who analysed the social and occupational groups of the FN voters in 2012, explained: &quot;The FN vote is made up of the victims of globalisation. It is the small shopkeepers who are going under because of the economic crisis and competition from the out-of-town hypermarkets; it is low-paid workers from the private sector; the unemployed. The FN scores well among people living in poverty, who have a real fear about how to make ends meet.&quot; Crépon also analysed the increase of the FN vote in &quot;rural&quot; areas and the recent sociological changes in these areas made up of small provincial towns and new housing-estate commuter belts built on the distant outskirts of the cities: &quot;The rural underclass is no longer agricultural. It is people who have fled the big cities and the inner suburbs because they can no longer afford to live there. Many of these people will have had recent experience of living in the banlieues (high immigration suburbs) – and have had contact with the problems of insecurity.&quot; Commentators also pointed that there were more young people and women voting for the party in 2012.

On 1 May 2012, during a speech delivered in Paris after the traditional Joan of Arc and Labor Day march, Le Pen refused to back either Sarkozy or Hollande in the run-off on 6 May. Addressing the party&#x27;s annual rally at Place de l&#x27;Opéra, she vowed to cast a blank ballot and told her supporters to vote with their conscience, saying: &quot;Hollande and Sarkozy – neither of them will save you. On Sunday I will cast a blank protest vote. I have made my choice. Each of you will make yours.&quot; Accusing both candidates of surrendering to Europe and financial markets, she asked: &quot;Who between Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy will impose the austerity plan in the most servile way? Who will submit the best to the instructions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) or the European Commission?&quot;.

=== Electoral results (2012–2016) ===
Following the increase in support for the FN in the presidential election, Le Pen announced the formation an electoral coalition to contest the June 2012 parliamentary elections called the Blue Marine Gathering. Standing as a candidate in the Pas-de-Calais&#x27; 11th constituency, Le Pen won 42.36% of the vote, well ahead of the Socialist representative Philippe Kemel (23.50%) and far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon (21.48%). She was defeated by Kemel in the second round with 49.86% and filed an appeal with the Constitutional Council, which was rejected despite an observation of some irregularities. Nationally, the FN had two lawmakers elected: Le Pen&#x27;s niece Marion Maréchal and Gilbert Collard.

In 2014, Le Pen led the party to further electoral advances in the municipal and senatorial elections: eleven mayors and two senators were elected, with the FN entering the upper chamber for the first time.
On 24 May 2014, the FN received the most votes in the European elections in France, with a 24.90% share. Marine Le Pen came in first place in her North-West constituency with 33.60%. 25 FN representatives were elected to the European Parliament from France. They voted against the Juncker Commission when it was formed in July 2014. One year later, Le Pen announced the formation of Europe of Nations and Freedom, a parliamentary grouping composed of the National Front, the Freedom Party of Austria, Lega Nord of Italy, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Congress of the New Right from Poland, the Flemish Vlaams Belang of Belgium, and British independent MEP Janice Atkinson, formerly of UKIP. Le Pen&#x27;s first attempt to assemble this grouping in 2014 had failed due to UKIP and the Sweden Democrats refusing to join, as well as some controversial statements from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Le Pen sat on the commission for international trade. In 2016, &quot;Politico&quot; ranked her as the second most influential MEP after Martin Schulz.

In April 2015, Le Pen&#x27;s father gave two interviews including controversial statements about World War II and about minorities in France, causing a political crisis in the FN. Marine Le Pen organised a postal vote to ask FN members to change the party&#x27;s statutes to expel her father. J-M Le Pen pursued his movement and the justice cancelled the vote. On 25 August, the FN executive office voted to expel him from the party he had founded forty years earlier. Marine&#x27;s dependence on her closest adviser, Florian Philippot, a former left-wing technocrat, was observed. The party instigated a purge to expel the members who had opposed the changes within the FN under Marine Le Pen&#x27;s leadership.

Le Pen subsequently announced her candidacy for the presidency of the regional council of Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie in the 2015 regional elections, though she expressed her regret over the proximity of these elections to the next presidential election. On 6 December, she finished first with 40.6% of the vote, but the Socialist candidate (third with 18.12%) withdrew and declared support for her right-wing opponent Xavier Bertrand, who won with 57.80% of the vote. Her niece Marion also lost, under similar circumstances, by a smaller margin.

=== Second presidential candidacy (2016–2017) ===

====Leading candidate in polls====

Marine Le Pen announced her candidacy for the 2017 French presidential election on 8 April 2016. She appointed FN Senator David Rachline as her campaign manager. The FN had difficulty finding funding because of the refusal of French banks to provide credit. Instead, the FN borrowed 9 million from the First Czech-Russian Bank in Moscow in 2014, despite European Union sanctions placed on Russia following the annexation of Crimea. In February 2016, the FN asked Russia for another loan, this time of 27 million, but the second loan was not paid.
Political analysts suggested that Le Pen&#x27;s strong position in opinion polls was due to the absence of a primary in her party (consolidating her leadership), the news of the migrant crisis and terrorist attacks in France (reinforcing her political positions) and the very right-wing campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy in the Republican primary (enlarging her themes). In a 2016 interview with the BBC, Le Pen said that Donald Trump&#x27;s victory in the US presidential election would help her, saying that Trump had &quot;made possible what had previously been presented as impossible&quot;. However, she said she would not officially launch her campaign before February 2017, waiting for the results of the Republican and Socialist primaries, and preferred to keep a low media profile and use thematic think tanks to expand and promote her political program. As a result, her rare media appearances attracted large audiences (2.3 million viewers for &quot;Vie politique&quot; on TF1 on 11 September 2016 and 4 million for &quot;Une ambition intime&quot; on M6 on 16 October).

The FN&#x27;s communications also received media attention: a new Mitterrand-inspired poster depicting her in a rural landscape with the slogan &quot;Appeased France&quot; was a response to surveys indicating that she remained controversial for large parts of the French electorate. Satirical treatment of this poster led to the slogan being changed to: &quot;In the name of the people&quot;. Meanwhile, the FN logo and the name Le Pen were removed from campaign posters.

Le Pen launched her candidacy on 4 and 5 February 2017 in Lyon, promising a referendum on France&#x27;s membership of the European Union if she could not achieve her territorial, monetary, economic and legislative goals for the country within six months renegotiation with the EU. Her first campaign appearance on television, four days later, received the highest viewing figures on France 2 since the previous presidential election (16.70% with 3.7 million viewers). Her 2017 presidential campaign emphasized Le Pen as a softer, feminine figure, with a blue rose as a prominent campaign symbol.

==== Campaign ====

On 2 March 2017, the European Parliament voted to revoke Le Pen&#x27;s immunity from prosecution for tweeting violent imagery. Le Pen had tweeted an image of beheaded journalist James Foley in December 2015, which was deleted following a request from Foley&#x27;s family. Le Pen also faced prosecution for allegedly spending EU Parliament funds on her own political party; the lifting of her immunity from prosecution did not apply to the ongoing investigation into the misuse of parliamentary funds by the FN.
Le Pen met with several incumbent heads of state including Lebanon&#x27;s Michel Aoun, Chad&#x27;s Idriss Déby, and Russia&#x27;s Vladimir Putin.

The ground floor of the building which housed Le Pen&#x27;s campaign headquarters was targeted by an arson attempt during the early morning of 13 April 2017.

In 2017, Le Pen argued that France as a nation bore no responsibility for the Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup, in which Paris policemen arrested Jewish citizens for deportation to Auschwitz as part of the Holocaust. She repeated a Gaullist thesis according to which France was not represented by the Vichy regime, but by Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free France.

On 20 April 2017, in the wake of a shooting targeting police officers which was being treated as a suspected terrorist attack, Le Pen cancelled a planned campaign event. The next day, she called for the closure of all &quot;extremist&quot; mosques, a remark that was criticised by Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who accused her of attempting to &quot;capitalise&quot; on the incident. She also called for the expulsion of hate preachers and people on the French security services&#x27; watch list, and the revocation of their citizenship. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the attack could serve as &quot;ammunition&quot; for right-wing candidates in the election, including Le Pen.

On 21 April 2017, United States President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that the shooting would have &quot;a big effect on the presidential election.&quot; Later that day, Trump said that Le Pen was the &quot;strongest on borders, and she&#x27;s the strongest on what&#x27;s been going on in France.&quot; Meanwhile, former US President Barack Obama phoned Emmanuel Macron to express his support.

==== Second round ====

Le Pen won 21.3% of the vote (7.7 million votes) in the first round of the election on 23 April 2017, placing her second behind Macron, who received 24.0%, meaning that they would face each other in the run-off on 7 May. On 24 April 2017, the day after the first round of voting, Le Pen announced that she would temporarily step down as the leader of the FN in an attempt to unite voters. &quot;The President of the Republic is the president of all the French people, they must bring them all together,&quot; she said.

After progressing to the second round, she said that the campaign was now &quot;a referendum for or against France&quot; and tried to convince those voting for the hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon to support her. This choice was later criticised by those in her party who believed that she had abandoned François Fillon&#x27;s voters in spite of their conservative and anti-immigration stance. On 1 May 2017, a video emerged of Le Pen copying sections of a speech by Francois Fillon word-for-word.

In the first days of the second round campaign, the gap in opinion polls began to narrow. On 25 April, Le Pen went to Amiens in an unexpected visit to meet workers at the Whirlpool factory while Macron was in a meeting with local officials at the same time, with Le Pen receiving a positive welcome. Macron then also visited the factory workers, but was booed by a hostile crowd.

Le Pen was generally regarded as the loser of the televised debate between the two candidates. Her performance was strongly criticised by politicians, commentators, and members of her own party, and described as a &quot;sabotage&quot; by conservative journalist Éric Zemmour. Le Pen herself subsequently acknowledged that she had &quot;misfired&quot; during the debate. In the following days, she began to slip in opinion polls.

On 7 May, she conceded defeat to Emmanuel Macron. Her vote share of 33.9% was lower than any polls had predicted, and was attributed to her poor performance in the debate. She immediately announced a &quot;full transformation&quot; of the FN in the following months.

===Member of the National Assembly: 2017–present===
On 18 May 2017, Le Pen announced that she would run as a candidate at the parliamentary elections in the Pas-de-Calais&#x27;s 11th constituency, in her fifth attempt to be elected as a deputy. She received just under 46% of the vote in the first round, and won the second with just under 58% against Anne Roquet of En Marche. She became a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the National Assembly. She then resigned as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).

In 2019, it was reported that Le Pen no longer wants France to leave the European Union, nor for it to leave the euro currency. Instead, it was reported she and her party wants to change the EU bloc from the inside along with allied parties.

On 4 July 2021, she was elected again to lead the National Rally with no opposing candidate.

=== Third presidential candidacy and legislative election (2022) ===

In January 2020, Le Pen announced her third candidacy for president of France in the 2022 presidential election. On 15 January 2022, she launched her campaign.

In February 2022, during Le Pen&#x27;s presidential campaign, Stéphane Ravier, the only Senator from her political party, publicly endorsed her far-right presidential rival Éric Zemmour.

During the first round of the election, Le Pen won second place, with 23.15% of the votes. On 22 April, she participated in a televised debate against Macron. She was defeated in a run-off against Emmanuel Macron on 24 April: on this occasion, she obtained 41.45% of the votes, the highest share of the vote for a nationalist candidate in French history.

It was remarked that a Є10.6 million loan provided by the Hungarian bank MKB Bank chaired by Lőrinc Mészáros, a close ally of Viktor Orban, was used to finance her presidential campaign. The transaction depended on Orban to be completed; normally the bankers would not have done it.

During the 2022 French legislative election which followed soon after, she led her party into winning its highest number of seats in the National Assembly since its founding, RN eventually becoming the largest opposition party in Parliament. Days later, she was elected by acclamation as leader of the parliamentary National Rally party in the Assembly, a position she currently holds.

=== Standing down ===
In November 2022 Le Pen stood down from chairing the National Rally. She was succeeded by Jordan Bardella who had previously acted as the party&#x27;s interim leader during her presidential campaign.

==Political positions==


===Immigration and multiculturalism===

Le Pen and the RN advocate a tough line on immigration, believing that multiculturalism has failed, and oppose what they see as the &quot;Islamisation&quot; of France. Le Pen has called for a moratorium on legal immigration. She would repeal laws allowing illegal immigrants to become legal residents, and has argued that benefits provided to immigrants be reduced to remove incentives for new immigrants. Following the beginning of the Arab Spring and the European migrant crisis, she called for France to withdraw from the Schengen Area and reinstate border controls.

She supports restrictions on ritual slaughter.

Le Pen took part in the March for the Republic and Against Antisemitism in Paris on 12 November 2023 in response to the rise in antisemitism since the start of the 2023 Israel–Hamas War.

===Economic policy===
On energy, Le Pen advocates a policy of energy independence for France, with a strong emphasis on support for nuclear and hydroelectric power. Le Pen is strongly opposed to wind energy due to its intermittency, tax burden in utility bills and impact on the landscape and built heritage. She is proposing a moratorium on new wind energy development on both sea and land from 2022 and the eventual dismantling of all current wind turbines. Le Pen favours protectionism as an alternative to free trade. She supports economic nationalism, the separation of investment and retail banking, and energy diversification, and is opposed to the privatization of public services and social security, speculation on international commodity markets, and is opposed to the Common Agricultural Policy. Le Pen also supports maintaining France&#x27;s system of sectoral bargaining and opposed Macron&#x27;s reforms of the labour code.

Le Pen is opposed to globalization, which she blames for various negative economic trends, and opposes European Union supranationalism and federalism, instead favouring a loosely confederate &#x27;Europe of the Nations&#x27;. As of 2019, she no longer advocates for France to leave the EU or euro currency; she had previously called both for France to leave the Eurozone and for a referendum on France leaving the EU. She has been a vocal opponent of the Treaty of Lisbon, and opposes EU membership for Turkey and Ukraine. She proposes the replacement of the World Trade Organization and the abolition of the International Monetary Fund.

===Foreign policy===
On foreign policy, Le Pen has criticised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. She also criticised the privileged relations that France maintains with countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which she said are helping to fund and arm Islamist fundamentalists, while encouraging closer ties with the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which she said &quot;fight fundamentalism&quot;. She has said she believes that Ukraine has been &quot;subjugated&quot; by the United States. She was strongly critical of NATO policy in the region, of Eastern European anti-Russian sentiment, and of threatened economic sanctions. In response to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Le Pen criticized Russia&#x27;s action despite her previous pro-Russia stance. She advocated welcoming Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war. She has stated that if elected she would remove France from NATO&#x27;s integrated military command. In October 2023, she condemned Hamas&#x27; actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed her support to Israel and its right to self-defense. In May 2024, she officially met with an Israeli government minister for the first time.

===Other issues===
Regarding feminism, Le Pen often says she identifies as a feminist in the context of defending women&#x27;s rights and improving women&#x27;s lives, although she is critical of what she calls &quot;neo-feminism&quot;, which she characterises as women going to war against men.

==Media image==

===National media===

Le Pen&#x27;s appearances on television and radio have played an important role in her political career, and her political activities are regularly covered in the French media.

During an appearance on the programme &quot;Mots croisés&quot; (Crossed Words) on France 2 on 5 October 2009, Le Pen quoted sections of Frédéric Mitterrand&#x27;s autobiographical novel &quot;The Bad Life&quot;, accusing him of having sex with underage boys and engaging in sex tourism, and demanding his resignation as Minister of Culture. According to French political commentator Jérôme Fourquet, the Mitterrand case was Le Pen&#x27;s media breakthrough.

Le Pen appeared several times on &quot;À vous de juger&quot; (You Be The Judge), a political discussion show on France 2 hosted by journalist and commentator Arlette Chabot. In her first appearance, on 14 January 2010, Marine Le Pen appeared opposite Éric Besson, then-Minister of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Mutually Supportive Development.
In her first appearance as a main guest on &quot;À vous de juger&quot;, on 9 December 2010, she was questioned on economic, social and immigration issues by Chabot and political commentator Alain Duhamel; she then took part in debates, first with the socialist Mayor of Évry Manuel Valls and then Rachida Dati, Minister of Justice. The broadcast was viewed by 3,356,000 viewers (14.6% of the television audience), the highest viewing figures for 2010 and the fourth highest since the series first aired in September 2005.

In December 2010, French journalist Guillaume Tabard described Le Pen as the &quot;revelation of the year&quot;, and as &quot;first an electoral phenomenon&quot; and &quot;a media phenomenon after&quot;.

&quot;À vous de juger&quot; was replaced on France 2 by &quot;Des paroles et des actes&quot; (Words and Acts), hosted by journalist and anchorman David Pujadas. In her first appearance as a main guest on 23 June 2011, Le Pen appeared opposite Cécile Duflot, national secretary of The Greens. The broadcast was viewed by 3,582,000 viewers (15.1% of the television audience at the time).

Le Pen has also appeared on &quot;Parole directe&quot; (Direct Speech) on TF1, hosted by Laurence Ferrari and political commentator François Bachy. Her first appearance as a sole guest on 15 September 2011 was viewed by an average of 6 million viewers (23.3% of the television audience) with a peak of 7.3 million in the second half of the programme.

===International media===
Le Pen has appeared in the news media of other European countries, Russia, the Middle East, and the United States. She appeared on Quebec web-radio station Rockik in December 2008, Radio Canada in May 2010, and the Israeli radio station 90FM in March 2011. In March 2011, she appeared on the front cover of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; magazine. She spoke to international journalists at a press conference on 13 January 2012, organised by the European American Press Club.

On 21 April 2011, she was featured in the 2011 &quot;Time&quot; 100 with a commentary from Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and vice chairman of the State Duma.

In October 2011, she launched her book &quot;Pour que vive la France&quot; in Verona, Italy, and met Assunta Almirante, the widow of Giorgio Almirante, leader of the far-right Italian Social Movement (MSI).

In February 2013, she spoke at the Cambridge Union Society, the debating society of the University of Cambridge. Her appearance sparked controversy, with anti-fascist group Unite Against Fascism opposing her invitation on a No Platform basis and organising a demonstration outside the venue, attended by around 200 people. The protests were supported by numerous Cambridge societies, including Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union and Cambridge University Labour Club; other groups, such as the Cambridge Libertarians, supported her invitation.

==Legal issues==
In October 2023, Le Pen was convicted of committing defamation against French NGO Cimade when she accused the organization in a January 2022 television interview of being &quot;accomplices to smugglers&quot; and being involved in an &quot;illegal immigration network from the Comoros&quot; in Mayotte. She was ordered to pay €500 and to also sustain court costs.

In December 2023, Le Pen was ordered to stand trial after she was charged with paying National Rally party officials through funds earmarked for European Parliament assistants. Twenty-seven others, including her father Jean Marie, will serve as her co-defendants. Her trial, for embezzlement of public funds, was scheduled in March 2024 to occur between 30 September and 27 November the same year. Le Pen claimed as a self defense that she has committed no wrongdoing. The founder of the party, Marine Le Pen’s father and a former member of the EU assembly, was also supposed to have a trial, but judges decided the 96-year-old was too fragile.

==Elections contested==

===European elections===
In the 2004 European Parliament election, Le Pen led the FN list in the Île-de-France constituency. The list polled 8.58% (234,893 votes), winning one of fourteen available seats.

In the 2009 European parliament election, Le Pen led the FN list in the North-West France constituency. The party polled 10.18% (253,009 votes), the highest FN vote share of French constituencies, and won one of the ten seats. The FN&#x27;s constituency list received its highest regional result in Picardy (12.57%, 63,624 votes), its highest departmental result in Aisne (13.40%, 19,125 votes), and its highest municipal results in Pas-de-Calais: Hénin-Beaumont (27.92%, 1,799 votes), Courcelles-lès-Lens (26.57%), Noyelles-Godault (24.72%).

===Parliamentary elections===
====Paris in 1993====
Le Pen first stood for parliament in the 1993 legislative election, in Paris&#x27; 16th constituency (17th arrondissement of Paris). She finished third with 11.10% (3,963 votes), and Bernard Pons (UDR) was re-elected as the MP with 63.14% (22,545 votes) in the first round.

====Lens in 2002====
She stood in the 2002 election in Pas-de-Calais&#x27; 13th constituency, Lens, an economically deprived socialist stronghold. Le Pen polled 24.24% (10,228 votes) in the first round, qualifying for the run-off against socialist Jean-Claude Bois, in which Le Pen received 32.30% (12,266 votes); Bois was re-elected as the MP with 67.70% (27,510 votes).

====Hénin-Beaumont in 2007====

In the 2007 election, Le Pen and her substitute Steeve Briois stood for the FN in the Pas-de-Calais&#x27; 14th constituency, Hénin-Beaumont, a former coal mining area with high unemployment. Le Pen expressed the view that due to unemployment, offshoring and insecurity, the constituency symbolised the major problems of France. Le Pen&#x27;s campaign committee was led by Daniel Janssens, who had previously served for 24 years as the socialist deputy mayor of Leforest.

Le Pen finished second of fourteen candidates in the first round with 24.47% (10,593 votes), behind incumbent Socialist MP Albert Facon with 28.24% (12,221 votes). Le Pen was the only FN candidate in France to qualify for the run-off. After the first round, Le Pen was endorsed by Gaullist politicians Alain Griotteray and Michel Caldaguès and the &quot;souverainiste&quot; MEP Paul-Marie Coûteaux.

In the run-off, Le Pen received 41.65% (17,107 votes), and Facon was re-elected as the MP with 58.35% (23,965 votes). Her strongest results came in Courcelles-lès-Lens (48.71%), Noyelles-Godault (47.85%), and Hénin-Beaumont (44.54%, 4,729 votes). According to political analysts, Le Pen&#x27;s strong showing in the constituency was a result of economic and social issues like de-industrialization, unemployment and a feeling of abandonment, rather than immigration or security.

====Hénin-Beaumont in 2012====
In the 2012 election, Le Pen, now leader of the FN, stood in Pas-de-Calais&#x27; 11th constituency, which now contained Henin-Beaumont following redistricting, where she had got her best results in the presidential election. Her opponents were Philippe Kemel and Jean-Luc Mélenchon. She finished first in the first round on 10 June 2012, with 42.36% (22,280 votes), and was defeated in the second round by Philippe Kemel.

In 2014, the Criminal Court of Bethune found Marine Le Pen guilty of electoral fraud, for producing and distributing flyers during the 2012 election purporting to be from electoral opponent Jean-Luc Mélenchon, calling for &#x27;Arab&#x27; votes. She was ordered to pay a 10,000 fine.

====Hénin-Beaumont in 2017====
In the 2017 French legislative election, Le Pen once again stood in Pas-de-Calais&#x27; 11th constituency. She finished first in the first round on 11 June 2017, with 46.02% (19,997 votes), and won the seat in the second round with 58.60% (22,769 votes) over Anne Roquet of La République En Marche!.

====Hénin-Beaumont in 2022====
In the 2022 French legislative election, Le Pen stood for re-election in Pas-de-Calais&#x27; 11th constituency. She finished first in the first round on 12 June 2022, with 53.96% (21,219 votes), and won the seat again in the second round with 61.03% (22,301 votes) over Marine Tondelier of Europe Ecology – The Greens.

====Hénin-Beaumont in 2024====
Le Pen once again stood for re-election in Pas-de-Calais&#x27; 11th constituency in the 2024 French legislative election.

===Regional elections===
====Nord-Pas-de-Calais in 1998====

In the 1998 elections, she was included in the FN list in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and was a regional councillor for six years (1998–2004).

====Île-de-France in 2004====

In the 2004 elections, she led the FN regional list in Île-de-France and the departmental list in Hauts-de-Seine.

Her list polled 12.26% (448,983 votes) in the first round and achieved 10.11% (395,565 votes) with fifteen councillors elected in the run-off.

Le Pen led the regional group for five years, stepping down in February 2009 to concentrate on the European election campaign in the North-West France constituency. A member of the standing committee, she led opposition to the left-wing regional executive managed by Jean-Paul Huchon.

====Nord-Pas-de-Calais in 2010====

In the 2010 elections, Marine Le Pen led the FN regional list in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and the departmental list in Pas-de-Calais.

In the first round, her list polled 18.31% (224.871 votes) and finished in third position in Nord-Pas-de-Calais. In Pas-de-Calais, her list polled 19.81% (96,556 votes), ahead of the UMP (15.91%, 77,550 votes), and won by a large margin in Hénin-Beaumont (39.08%, 2,949 votes). Le Pen&#x27;s list achieved the second-highest result of FN regional lists in the country, behind her father Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s list in Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, which received 20.30% (296,283 votes). In Pas-de-Calais, she received a higher share of the vote than Jean-Marie Le Pen had received in the first round of the 2002 presidential election (18.41%, 135,330 votes).

In the run-off, her list polled 22.20% (301,190 votes) in Nord-Pas-de-Calais, finishing in third position. Eighteen FN councillors were elected among the 113 of Nord-Pas-de-Calais&#x27; regional council. Le Pen&#x27;s list had the second highest vote share of FN regional lists in France, behind Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s list which received 22.87% (387,374 votes) with 21 councillors elected. In Pas-de-Calais, her list polled 24.37% (130,720 votes), finishing ahead of the UMP (22.63%, 121,365 votes), and achieved its highest municipal results in Hénin-Beaumont (44.23%, 3,829 votes) and Courcelles-lès-Lens (40.60%). Her list achieved the second-highest departmental FN result in the country behind Vaucluse (26.54%). Her regional vote share and the vote share in Pas-de-Calais were higher than those of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the run-off of the 2002 presidential election (21.89%, 445,357 votes; 22.17%, 170,967 votes).

Le Pen&#x27;s success in these elections reinforced her internal position within the FN. As a member of the standing committee and a president of the regional group (Front National/Gathering for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais), she led opposition to the left-wing regional executive managed by Daniel Percheron.

===Municipal elections===
====Hénin-Beaumont in 2008====

Since 2001, Gérard Dalongeville has been the Mayor of Hénin-Beaumont, an economically deprived town in a former coal mining area.

A municipal councillor since 1995, Steeve Briois led the FN list with Marine Le Pen in second position. The FN list came second with 28.53% (3,650 votes) in the first round and achieved 28.83% (3,630 votes) with five councillors elected in the run-off.

Following the election, Briois and Le Pen sat in opposition against the re-elected mayor Gérard Dalongeville and his first vice-mayor Marie-Noëlle Lienemann.

====2009 Hénin-Beaumont by-election====
A municipal by-election was held in Hénin-Beaumont on 28 June and 5 July 2009. As in 2008, Steeve Briois was the FN top candidate with Le Pen in second position.

The FN list led by a large margin after the first round, with 39.33% (4,485 votes), and received 47.62% (5,504 votes) in the run-off, with eight councillors elected, though the FN again failed to win the municipality.

Briois, Le Pen and the six other FN councillors formed the opposition against the new mayor Daniel Duquenne and his successor Eugène Binaisse.

On 24 February 2011, Le Pen resigned as a municipal councillor because of the law on the accumulation of mandates (&quot;cumul des mandats&quot;). In a letter entitled &quot;I stay in Hénin-Beaumont!&quot;, she expressed the view that her political activities would be more effective for the city at regional and European levels than in the municipal council.

<text>An exponential tree is a type of search tree where the number of children of its nodes decreases doubly-exponentially with increasing depth. Values are stored only in the leaf nodes. Each node contains a splitter, a value less than or equal to all values in the subtree which is used during search. Exponential trees use another data structure in inner nodes containing the splitters from children, allowing fast lookup.

Exponential trees achieve optimal asymptotic complexity on some operations. They have mainly theoretical importance.

== Tree structure ==
An exponential tree is a rooted tree where every node contains a splitter and every leaf node contains a value. The value may be different from the splitter. An exponential tree with formula_1 values is defined recursively:
* The root has formula_2 children
* The splitter of the root is the same as the splitter of the leftmost child
* The splitters of all children are stored in a local data structure
* The subtrees are exponential trees with formula_3 values

An additional condition is that searching for a value using the splitters must yield the correct node (i.e. the one containing the value). Therefore, if a root of a subtree contains the splitter formula_4 and its right sibling contains the splitter formula_5, then this subtree can only contain keys in the range formula_6.

== Local data structure ==
The tree uses a static data structure in every inner node to allow fast lookup of values. It must be possible to build this structure with formula_7 values in time formula_8. The lookup time in this structure is denoted formula_9.

A Fusion tree can be used as this data structure.

== Operations ==
=== Search ===
The exponential tree can be searched in the same way as a normal search tree. In each node, the local data structure can be used to find the next child quickly.

Let formula_10 denote the time complexity of the search. Then it satisfies the following recurrence:

formula_11

<doc id="572904" wikidata="Q913532" url="?curid=572904" title="Charro">
<text>Charro, in Mexico, is historically the horseman from the countryside, the Ranchero, who lived and worked in the haciendas and performed all his tasks on horseback, working mainly as vaqueros and caporales, among other jobs. He was renowned for his superb horsemanship, for his skill in handling the lasso, and for his unique costume designed specially for horseback riding. Today, this name is given to someone who practices &quot;charreada&quot; (similar to a rodeo), considered the national sport of Mexico which maintains traditional rules and regulations in effect from colonial times up to the Mexican Revolution.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;charro&quot; (syn. &quot;charrar, charra&quot;) was first documented in Spain in the book &quot;Vocabulario de refranes y frases proverbiales&quot; (1627) by Gonzalo Correas as a synonym of dumb or stupid person. More than one hundred years later, in 1729, in the first dictionary of the Spanish language edited by the Real Academia Española, the &quot;Diccionario de Autoridades&quot; &quot;charro&quot; was defined as: The first edition of the Real Academia dictionary published in 1780, kept that original definition, defining &quot;charro&quot; as: &quot;the rough and rustic person, as the villagers tend to be&quot;; but they would add a second meaning for the first time: &quot;adjective that is applied to some things that are too laden with decoration and in bad taste&quot;. Thus, it was a derogatory term applied to country people because they’re perceived as ignorant, rough and unsophisticated, and to things that were too laden in decoration but in bad taste. Synonymous with the English terms: yokel, &quot;bumpkin&quot;, boor, &quot;hick&quot;, &quot;gaudy&quot; and &quot;garish&quot;

Spanish-English dictionaries like the &quot;Diccionario Español e Inglés&quot; (1786) defined Charro as: &quot;rustic, country like&quot;. While the 1802 &quot;A New Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages&quot; defined it as: &quot;a clownish, coarse, ill-bred person&quot; and &quot;Gaudy, loaded with ornaments in a tasteless and paltry manner&quot;.

In 1745, the Basque Jesuit, Manuel Larramendi, argued that the word was of Basque origin and that it meant: &quot;vile and despicable thing&quot;, and wrote that country people and villagers were called that out of contempt. While the historian and philosopher Antonio de Capmany y Montpalau, argued that the origin of the word was Arabic and that it originally meant &quot;bad of moral malice and of customs&quot; passing on to the Spanish to mean artistic malice, thus something &quot;charro&quot; is the same as something &quot;gaudy&quot; and &quot;tasteless&quot;. 

In Mexico, since the 18th century, the term &quot;charro&quot; was applied in a derogatory manner to the &quot;Rancheros&quot;, the inhabitants of the countryside and haciendas who carried out all their tasks on horseback, because, as country people, they were perceived as ignorant, crude and unsophisticated. Over time, the word evolved being redefined in Mexico, going from being a derogatory adjective to a noun, synonymous with &quot;Ranchero&quot; or vaquero, and &quot;great horseman&quot;. In 1850, the Spanish historian and writer based in Mexico, Niceto de Zamacois, defined what &quot;Charro&quot; was in Mexico, as: 

==Origins==


The Viceroyalty of New Spain had prohibited Native Americans from riding or owning horses, with the exception of the Tlaxcaltec nobility, other allied chieftains, and their descendants. However, cattle raising required the use of horses, for which farmers would hire cowboys who were preferably mestizo and, rarely, Indians. Some of the requirements for riding a horse were that one had to be employed by a plantation, had to use saddles that differed from those used by the military, and had to wear leather clothing from which the term &quot;cuerudo&quot; (leathered one) originated.

Over time landowners and their employees, starting with those living in the Mexican Plateau and later the rest of the country, adapted their cowboy style to better suit the Mexican terrain and temperature, evolving away from the Spanish style of cattle raising. After the Mexican War of Independence horse riding grew in popularity. Many riders of mixed race became mounted mercenaries, messengers and plantation workers. Originally known as Chinacos, these horsemen later became the modern &quot;vaqueros&quot;. Wealthy plantation owners would often acquire decorated versions of the distinctive Charro clothing and horse harness to display their status in the community. Poorer riders would also equip their horses with harness made from agave or would border their saddles with chamois skin.

== Mexican War of Independence and the 19th century ==


As the Mexican War of Independence began in 1810 and continued for the next 11 years, charros were very important soldiers on both sides of the war. Many haciendas, or Spanish owned estates, had a long tradition of gathering their best charros as a small militia for the estate to fend off bandits and marauders. When the War for Independence started, many haciendas had their own armies in an attempt to fend off early struggles for independence.

After independence was achieved in 1821, political disorder made law and order hard to establish throughout much of Mexico. Large bands of bandits plagued the early 19th century as a result of lack of legitimate ways for social advance. One of the most notable gang was called &quot;the silver ones&quot; or the &quot;plateados&quot;; these thieves dressed as traditional wealthy charros, adorning their clothing and saddles with much silver, channeling the elite horseman image. The bandit gangs would disobey or buy out government, establishing their own profit and rules.

Towards the mid 19th century, however, President Juárez established the &quot;rurales&quot; or mounted rural police to crack down on gangs and enforce national law across Mexico. It was these rurales that helped to establish the charro look as one of manhood, strength, and nationhood. 

During the Second Mexican Empire, Maximilian I of Mexico reigned as emperor and liked to wear a charro suit as the national costume to ingratiate himself with his subjects. He was an avid and skilled horsemen and impressed by the local charros. Emperor Maximilian himself designed the elegant all black charro traje, or costume, as acceptable attire for formal occasions, which the charros and mariachi ensembles by extension still use in modern days. 

Charros were quickly seen as national heroes as Mexican politicians in the late 19th century pushed for the romanticized charro lifestyle and image as an attempt to unite the nation after the conservative and liberal clashes.

==Early twentieth-century usage==

Prior to the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the distinctive &quot;charro&quot; suit, with its sombrero, sarape, heavily embroidered jacket and tightly cut trousers, was widely worn by men of the affluent upper classes on social occasions, especially when on horseback. A light grey version, with silver embroidery and buttons, served as the uniform of the rurales (mounted rural police).

However, the most notable example of &#x27;charrería&#x27; is General Emiliano Zapata who was known before the revolution as a skilled rider and horse tamer.

Although it is said that charros came from the states of Jalisco in Mexico, it was not until the 1930s that charrería became a rules sport, as rural people began moving towards the cities. During this time, paintings of charros also became popular.

During World War II, an army of 150,000 charros was created, the &quot;Legión de Guerrilleros Mexicanos&quot;, in anticipation of an eventual attack of German forces. It was led by Antolin Jimenez Gamas, president of the National Association of Charros, a former soldier of Pancho Villa during the Mexican Revolution who climbed the ranks to Lieutenant Colonel in the Personal Guard of Villa&#x27;s &quot;Dorados&quot;.

==Use of term==
Although the word &quot;charro&quot; was a originally just a derogatory term for country people, synonymous with English words yokel or bumpkin, and gaudy, it evolved independently in different countries, becoming a demonym for the people of the province of Salamanca, in Spain, also known by Campo Charro, especially in the area of Alba de Tormes, Vitigudino, Ciudad Rodrigo and Ledesma; and a noun synonymous with the name &quot;Ranchero&quot;, the horse mounted people of the Mexican countryside. In other places in Latin America, it retained its original derogatory meaning. In Puerto Rico, &quot;charro&quot; is a generally accepted slang term to mean that someone or something is obnoxiously out of touch with social or style norms, similar to the United States usage of &quot;&quot;, (i.e gaudy). The traditional Mexican &quot;charro&quot; is known for colorful clothing and participating in &quot;charreada&quot;, a specific type of Mexican rodeo. The charreada is the national sport in Mexico, and is regulated by the &quot;Federación Mexicana de Charrería&quot;.

==In cinema==
The &quot;charro film&quot; was a genre of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema between 1935 and 1959, and probably played a large role in popularizing the charro, akin to what occurred with the advent of the American Western. The most notable charro stars were José Alfredo Jiménez, Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, Antonio Aguilar, and Tito Guizar. The 1969 Western film &quot;Charro!&quot; was Elvis Presley&#x27;s only movie in which he did not sing on-screen; the film featured no songs at all other than his voice singing &quot;Charro!&quot; over the main title and opening credits as gunslinger Presley rides into town. It was also the only movie in which Presley wore a beard. The film&#x27;s promotion read, &#x27;A different kind of role, a different kind of man&#x27;.

== Modern day ==
In all the states of Mexico – and in some US states such as California, Texas, and Illinois – charros participate in tournaments to show off their skill either in team competition charreada, or in individual competition such as coleadero. These events are practiced in a Lienzo charro.

Some decades ago, charros in Mexico were permitted to carry guns. In conformity with current law, the charro must be fully suited and be a fully pledged member of Mexico&#x27;s Federación Mexicana de Charrería.

<doc id="572906" wikidata="Q12139145" url="?curid=572906" title="Prior art">
<text>Prior art (also known as state of the art or background art) is a concept in patent law used to determine the patentability of an invention, in particular whether an invention meets the novelty and the inventive step or non-obviousness criteria for patentability. In most systems of patent law, prior art is generally defined as anything that is made available, or disclosed, to the public that might be relevant to a patent&#x27;s claim before the effective filing date of a patent application for an invention. However, notable differences exist in how prior art is specifically defined under different national, regional, and international patent systems.

The prior art is evaluated by patent offices as part of the patent granting process in what is called &quot;substantive examination&quot; of a patent application in order to determine whether an invention claimed in the patent application meets the novelty and inventive step or non-obviousness criteria for patentability. It may also be considered by patent offices or courts in opposition or invalidity proceedings. Patents disclose to society how an invention is practiced, in return for the right (during a limited term) to exclude others from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale or using the patented invention without the patentee&#x27;s permission. 

Patent offices deal with prior art searches in the context of the patent granting procedure. A patent search is frequently carried out by patent offices or patent applicants in order to identify relevant prior art. Certain patent offices may also rely on the patent search results of other patent offices or cooperate with other patent offices in order to identify relevant prior art. Prior art may also be submitted by the public for consideration in examination or in opposition or invalidity proceedings. Relevant prior art identified by patent offices or patent applicants are often cited by patent applicants in patent applications and by patent offices in patent search reports.

== Defining prior art ==
Prior art may comprise information that is disclosed to the public in written form, oral form, or by use. Sources of disclosure in written form may include published patents or patent applications or scientific and technical books and journals. Unpublished patent applications may also be considered prior art under certain circumstances, for example where an unpublished patent application was filed at the same patent office before the effective filing date of the patent application in question. 

To anticipate the subject-matter of a patent claim, prior art is generally expected to provide a description sufficient to inform an average worker in the field (or the &quot;person skilled in the art&quot;) of some subject matter falling within the scope of the claim. Prior art must be available in some way to the public, and in many countries, the information needs to be recorded in a fixed form somehow. 

=== Specific cases ===
Traditional knowledge, such as traditional medicine, may be considered prior art. Information covered by non-disclosure agreements or similar may not be considered to have been disclosed to the public and thus not prior art.

If an invention has been described in the prior art or would have been obvious from what has been described in the prior art, a patent on that invention is not valid. 

Information kept secret, for instance, as a trade secret, is not usually prior art, provided that employees and others with access to the information are under a non-disclosure obligation. With such an obligation, the information is typically not regarded as prior art. Therefore, a patent may be granted on an invention, even though someone else already knew of the invention. A person who used an invention in secret may in some jurisdictions be able to claim &quot;prior user rights&quot; and thereby gain the right to continue using the invention. As a special exception, earlier-filed and unpublished patent applications do qualify as prior art as of their filing date in certain circumstances.

Prior art generally does not include unpublished work or mere conversations (though, according to the European Patent Convention, oral disclosures also form prior art—see ).

==Effective date of patents and patent applications as prior art==
It is typical for a patent office to treat its own patents and published patent applications as prior art as of their filing dates, although under the European Patent Convention, this applies only to novelty rather than inventive step. However, United States patent law before the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) included the Hilmer doctrine, under which United States patents and patent application publications were prior art only as of their earliest effective United States filing dates, i.e., disregarding any foreign priority claimed in those patents and patent application publications. The AIA has abolished the Hilmer doctrine and makes United States patents and patent application publications that name another inventor prior art as of when they were &quot;effectively filed.&quot;

==Usage in litigation==
Arguments claiming prior art are used in defending and attacking patent validity. In one U.S. case on the issue, the court said:

== Prior art searches ==
Patent offices deal with prior art searches in the context of the patent granting procedure. A patent search is frequently carried out by patent offices or patent applicants in order to identify relevant prior art. Certain patent offices may also rely on the patent search results of other patent offices or cooperate with other patent offices in order to identify relevant prior art. Prior art may also be submitted by the public for consideration in examination or in opposition or invalidity proceedings. Relevant prior art identified by patent offices or patent applicants are often cited by patent applicants in patent applications and by patent offices in patent search reports.

=== Types of prior art searches ===

====Novelty====
A &quot;novelty search&quot; is a prior art search that is often conducted by patent attorneys, patent agents or professional patent searchers before a patent application is filed. A novelty search helps an inventor determine if the invention is novel before committing the resources necessary to obtain a patent. The search may include searching in databases of patents, patent applications and other documents such as utility models and in the scientific literature. Novelty searches can also be used to help an inventor determine what is unique about their invention. Anything not found in the prior art can be potentially patentable. Thomas Edison, for example, did not get a patent on the basic concept of the light bulb. It was already patented and therefore forms part of the prior art. Instead, Edison got a patent on his improvements to the light bulb. These improvements included a very thin filament and a reliable technique for joining the white hot filament to the room temperature lead wires.

A novelty search is also conducted by patent examiners during prosecution of the patent application. For instance, examiner&#x27;s search guidelines applicable to the United States are found in the U.S. Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) 904.02 General Search Guidelines, Prior Art, Classification, and Search.

====Validity====
A &quot;validity search&quot; is a prior art search done after a patent issues. The purpose of a validity (or invalidity) search is to find prior art that the patent examiner overlooked so that a patent can be declared invalid. This might be done by an entity infringing, or potentially infringing, the patent, or it might be done by a patent owner or other entity that has a financial stake in a patent to confirm the validity of a patent. Crowdsourcing, where a large number of interested people search for prior art, may be effective where references would otherwise be difficult to find.

====Clearance====
A clearance search is a search of issued patents to assess whether a given product or process violates someone else&#x27;s existing patent. If so, then a validity search may be done to try to find prior art that would invalidate the patent. A clearance search is a search targeting patents being in force and may be limited to a particular country and group of countries, or a specific market.

=== Notable prior art databases ===

* DEPATISnet – Public patent database made available by the German Patent and Trademark Office, serving as official publication source for German patents and patent applications and covering numerous other national and regional patent collections
* Espacenet—European Patent Office public patent literature database, with patents from many patent offices.
*Google Patents—public search engine from Google that indexes patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and other international patent offices, and machine-CPC-classified non-patent literature from Google Scholar.
*PATENTSCOPE – the PATENTSCOPE public patent database provided by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) serves as official publication source for patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and covering numerous national and regional patent collections.
*Patent Register Portal provides online patent hosts registers, gazettes, and legal-status-related information from over 200 jurisdictions and patent information collections. 
The Internet Archive Wayback Machine is recognized by the USPTO as a valid source of prior art on the Internet, though generally the date of archiving is considered the first published date, rather than the date on any documents that have been archived.

==Duty of disclosure==
In the United States, inventors and their patent agents or attorneys are required by law to submit any references they are aware of to the United States Patent and Trademark Office that may be material to the patentability of the claims in a patent application they have filed. The patent examiner will then determine if the references qualify as &quot;prior art&quot; and may then take them into account when examining the patent application. If a person having a duty to disclose, acting with deceptive intent, fails to properly disclose the material references of which they are aware, then a patent can be found unenforceable for inequitable conduct.

Japan also has a duty of disclosure.

Australia has abolished its duty of disclosure with regard to the results of documentary searches by, or on behalf of, foreign patent offices, except where: 
*(a) normal exam was requested before April 22, 2007,
*(b) the foreign patent office search issued before April 22, 2007, and 
*(c) acceptance (allowance) was officially advertised before July 22, 2007.

==Public participation in patent examination ==
With the advent of the Internet, a number of initiatives have been undertaken to create a forum where the public at large can participate in prior art searches. These forums have been related to both issued patents and pending patent applications.

=== Pending patent applications ===
More recently, different attempts to employ open Internet-based discussions for encouraging public participation commenting on pending U.S. applications have been started. These may take the form of a wiki:
* Peer-to-patent online system for open, community patent review.
* patents@stackexchange. A Q&amp;A site for people interested in improving and participating in the patent system.

Patent examiners often use the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a reference to get an overall feel for a given subject. Citations of Wikipedia as actual prior art can be problematic, however, due to the fluid and open nature of its editing, and Patents Commissioner Doll said the agency used Wikipedia entries as background and not as a basis for accepting or rejecting an application.

<text>Llamatron (stylized Llamatron: 2112 on the title screen) is a multidirectional shooter video game programmed by Jeff Minter of Llamasoft and released in 1991 for the Atari ST and Amiga and in 1992 for MS-DOS. Based on &quot;&quot;, players of &quot;Llamatron&quot; control the eponymous creature in an attempt to stop an alien invasion of Earth and rescue animals—referred to as &quot;Beasties&quot;—for points. Players advance by destroying all of the enemies on each level using a laser that fires automatically in the direction that the Llamatron is moving. Various power-ups exist to aid the player in defeating the wide variety of enemies and obstacles they face along the way.

Released in the later years of the Atari ST and Amiga, &quot;Llamatron&quot; was distributed as shareware, containing the full game and a request to register the program for £5 if the user enjoyed the game. As of March 1992, at least 800 people had registered the game, making it unusually successful for shareware distributed without locked features or other purchase incentives. Reviews of both the Atari ST and Amiga versions praised its addictive gameplay, sound effects, and value for the registration price. Minter released a commercial remake of the game for iOS, &quot;&quot;, in 2011.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Llamatron&quot; is a multidirectional shooter where the objective is to stop an invasion of Earth that is being launched by alien mutants known as the Zyaxxians. The player&#x27;s character—the eponymous Llamatron—is placed in the center of a black screen, with enemies—labelled in-game as &quot;Grunts&quot;—scattered across the playing area. Once the level begins, the enemies move towards the player and, if any of the enemies come into contact with the llama, the player loses a life. The player&#x27;s goal is to destroy every enemy on the screen with the llama&#x27;s laser, which fires automatically in the direction that the llama is facing. Players can also use a second joystick to control the direction of fire or hold the firing button down to lock the firing direction regardless of movement. The keyboard can also be used instead of a joystick. The game includes modes that allow a second player, or an indestructible computer-controlled &quot;droid&quot;, to assist the Llamatron.

The player gains points by destroying enemies and collecting llamas, sheep, goats, and camels—known collectively as &quot;Beasties&quot;—that are placed on the screen at the start of the level. Upon destroying all of the enemies on a screen, the player advances to the next level. Some levels, known as &quot;Herd Waves&quot;, also require the player to collect all of the &quot;Beasties&quot;. &quot;Grunts&quot; take a variety of forms, including Coca-Cola cans, kitchen utensils, cherries, Space Invaders, Eyes of Providence, televisions, fire hydrants, Zippy the Pinhead, marijuana plants, and Rizla rolling papers. Blue brains chase after the &quot;Beasties&quot; and transform them into &quot;Zombeasts&quot;, who then attempt to rush and kill the player. Other enemies include indestructible devices that shoot screen-wide lasers, 16-ton weights that attempt to crush the player, hedgehogs that explode into spikes when destroyed, Mandelbrot sets that shoot projectiles and scream when hit, and a large toilet that throws rolls of toilet paper at the player. The game contains 100 levels, in addition to a tutorial and a high-score table.

The player can collect power-ups to assist them in their task, such as smart bombs that damage all of the enemies, extra lives, invincibility, and hearts that attract the &quot;Beasties&quot; to the player. There are also items that allow shots to bounce off of walls, split into three, and become &quot;hot bullets&quot;, which deal extra damage. &quot;Warps&quot; add 50,000 points and immediately move the player ahead five levels. The &quot;Floyd bonus&quot; grants extra points and is shaped like the artwork from Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; album. In two-player mode, each player shares the score and the power-ups, but both players lose a life if one player dies.

==Development and release==
&quot;Llamatron&quot; was developed and programmed by Jeff Minter of Llamasoft software. It was intended to be an updated version of the Williams Electronics title &quot;&quot; with expanded and refined features. &quot;Llamatron&quot; was released in 1991, first for the Atari ST, and then for Amiga computers. A version for MS-DOS came out in 1992. The Atari ST and Amiga releases contain numerous sound effects, but no background music. The program was distributed as shareware, with the full game being available for free to try, but requesting that players register the game for £5 if they enjoyed it. At the time of its release for Amiga computers, people who registered would receive another game from Llamasoft, a poster, and a newsletter. Its release was described as an &quot;experiment&quot;, in that it neither required the player to buy the full game at a cost of £25, as was common for most commercially-distributed titles, nor was it crippleware that disabled certain features until the game was registered.

==Reception==
&quot;Llamatron&quot; received positive reviews upon its initial Amiga release. &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; featured &quot;Llamatron&quot; as the cover disk for its October 1991 issue, summarizing their positive review by saying &quot;All in all, the most apt comment one can make about Llamatron is that Mr Minter makes exceedingly good shoot-&#x27;em-ups.&quot; &quot;Amiga Format&quot; reviewed the game in their September 1991 issue, giving it a score of 89% and highlighting its &quot;simple gameplay [that] is fast and massively addictive.&quot; The review did mention several sound and graphical glitches, as well as occasional problems with collision detection, but overall recommended it as having &quot;superb value&quot;. &quot;Amiga Power&quot;, reviewing the game in August 1991, gave it four stars out five, criticizing the graphics as having a &quot;slightly cluttered and unclear look&quot;, but praising it overall as &quot;[a]n excellent game that deserves to be supported by anyone who&#x27;s ever paid out £25 for crap and been cheesed off about it.&quot; &quot;Zero Magazine&quot; recommended it as &quot;a no-nonsense megablast&quot; in its January 1992 issue.

&quot;Llamatron&quot; also received positive reviews for the Atari ST version. Writing for ST News, Richard Karsmakers called the game &quot;brilliant&quot; for its &quot;sheer playability, playing fun and other things that really count. I mean functional graphics that are fun to see, I mean good sonix that fit the game, and I mean oodles and oodles of gameplay.&quot; Out of 10, Karsmakers gave &quot;Llamatron&quot; 7 for graphics, 8.5 for sound, 9 for hookability and playability, and 10 for value, with a concluding remark of &quot;Wonderful! Unbelievable! Playable!&quot;. A retroactive review of the Amiga ST version by &quot;The Inquirer&quot; in March 2007 said that &quot;Llamatron&quot; &quot;without any question [...] is, was, and will always be a great game.&quot; &quot;The A–Z of Atari ST Games&quot; by Kieren Hawken gave &quot;Llamatron&quot; 10/10, claiming that &quot;[t]he graphics in &quot;Llamatron&quot; are great but the biggest props have to go the amazing [sic] digitised sounds [...] [i]t&#x27;s rare that you will hear sound effects this good in an Atari ST game.&quot; In 1996, GamesMaster ranked Llamatron 93rd in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

By March 1992, Minter had collected 800 registrations, which had earned him £4000. With registrations &quot;still arriving&quot; and the Amiga release &quot;just out&quot;, he estimated that he would make £10,000, &quot;not as much as a conventional release, but more than a budget game would generate.&quot; His success was seen as unusual in the shareware market and due in large part to the fact that &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; featured &quot;Llamatron&quot; as its cover disk. Additionally, Minter was already popular due to Llamasoft&#x27;s previous games. One critic of the concept, however, noted that &quot;if you compare the response of a few hundred to the tens of thousands of people who have probably played the game, then it works out that quite a low percentage of people have actually sent him money.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2011, Minter and Llamasoft released a remake of &quot;Llamatron&quot; for the iPhone and iPad iOS called &quot;&quot;. The game is similar in execution and presentation to &quot;Llamatron&quot;, although this time the player controls a Minotaur. Andrew Bailey of &quot;The Register&quot; wrote that &quot;Minotron: 2112&quot; &quot;delivers an authentic 8-bit trip down memory lane&quot; and &quot;may feel like blast from the past, but it is also, happily, just a blast.&quot;

<doc id="572917" wikidata="Q1354988" url="?curid=572917" title="Giles Corey">
<text>Giles Corey ( 16 August 1611 – 19 September 1692) was an English-born farmer who was accused of witchcraft along with his wife Martha Corey during the Salem witch trials in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. After being arrested, Corey refused to enter a guilty or not guilty plea. He was subjected to torture in the form of crushing in an effort to force him to plead, dying after three days of being crushed. Because Corey refused to enter a plea, his estate passed on to his sons instead of being seized by the Massachusetts colonial government.

Corey is believed to have died in the field adjacent to the prison that had held him, in what later became the Howard Street Cemetery in Salem, Massachusetts, which opened in 1801. His exact grave location in the cemetery is unmarked and unknown. There is a memorial plaque to him in the nearby Charter Street Cemetery.

==Pre-trial history==
Giles Corey was born in Northampton, Northamptonshire. He was baptized in the Holy Sepulchre, Northampton on 16 August 1611. Giles was the son of Giles and Elizabeth Corey. His birth is recorded in the parish records. His name is quite often spelled &quot;Corey,&quot; but the baptismal record is &quot;Cory.&quot; It is not certain when he arrived in North America, but there is evidence he was living in Salem Town as early as 1640. He originally lived in Salem Town but later moved to nearby Salem Village (now Danvers) to work as a farmer. There are quite a few entries in the court documents for which he was charged and confessed, mainly petty theft. Charges ranged from sleeping on the watch (and once having his weapon stolen from him while doing so), collecting a canoe load of firewood while on watch, and stealing food, tobacco, knives, and several other small items.

Despite these charges, Corey was a prosperous land-owning farmer in Salem and married three times. He is believed to have married his first wife, Margaret, in England. Margaret was the mother of his eldest four children: Martha, Margaret, Deliverance, and Elizabeth. His second wife was Mary Bright; they were married on 11 April 1664, when Corey was 53 years old, and had a son named John.

In 1676, Corey was brought to trial and charged with murder in Essex County, Massachusetts, for beating to death one of his indentured farm workers, Jacob Goodale (also spelled &quot;Goodell&quot; or &quot;Goodall&quot;), son of Robert and Catherine Goodale and brother to Isaac Goodale. According to witnesses, Corey had severely beaten Goodale with a stick after he was allegedly caught stealing apples from Corey&#x27;s brother-in-law. Though Corey eventually sent him to receive medical attention ten days later, Goodale died shortly thereafter. The local coroner, as well as numerous witnesses and eyewitnesses, testified against Corey, including neighbor John Proctor, who testified that he heard Corey admit he had beaten Goodale. Since corporal punishment was permitted against indentured servants, Corey was exempt from the charge of murder and instead was charged with using &quot;unreasonable&quot; force for which he was found guilty and fined.

Corey&#x27;s neighbor, John Proctor, also accused Corey of the arson of his home. Later, one of Proctor&#x27;s sons confessed. Corey&#x27;s second wife, Mary Bright, died in 1684. Corey later married his third wife, Martha Rich. Martha was admitted to the church at Salem Village, where Giles had lived. At the time of the witch trials, Corey was 80 years old and living with Martha in the southwest corner of Salem Village, in what is now Peabody.

==Arrest, examination, and refusal to plead==
Martha Corey was arrested for witchcraft on 19 March 1692. Corey was so swept up by the trials that he initially believed the accusations against his wife until he himself was arrested based on the same charge on 18 April, along with Mary Warren, Abigail Hobbs, and Bridget Bishop. The following day, they were examined by the authorities, during which Hobbs accused Giles of being a wizard. Giles denied the accusations and refused to plead (guilty or not guilty), was imprisoned and arraigned at the September sitting of the court.

The records of the Court of Oyer and Terminer on 9 September 1692 contain a deposition by one of the people who accused Giles of witchcraft in &quot;Mercy Lewis v. Giles Corey&quot;:

I saw the apparition of Giles Corey come and afflict me urging me to write in his book, and so he continued most dreadfully to hurt me by times beating me and almost breaking my back till the day of his examination being the and then also during the time of his examination he did afflict and torture me most grievously and also several times since urging me vehemently to write in his book and I verily believe in my heart that Giles Corey is a dreadful wizard for since he had been in prison he or his appearance has come and most grievously tormented me.

Again, in this court, Corey refused to plead.

==Death by pressing==
According to the law at the time, a person who refused to plead could not be tried. To avoid people cheating justice, the legal remedy for refusing to plead was &quot;peine forte et dure&quot;. In this process, prisoners were stripped naked and heavy boards were laid on their bodies. Then rocks or boulders were placed on the boards. This was the process of being pressed:

... remanded to the prison from whence he came and put into a low dark chamber, and there be laid on his back on the bare floor, naked, unless when decency forbids; that there be placed upon his body as great a weight as he could bear, and more, that he hath no sustenance save only on the first day, three morsels of the worst bread, and the second day three draughts of standing water, that should be alternately his daily diet till he died, or, till he answered.

As a result of his refusal to plead, on 17 September, Corey was subjected to the procedure by Sheriff George Corwin, but he was steadfast in that refusal, nor did he cry out in pain as the rocks were placed on the boards. After two days, Corey was asked three times to enter a plea, but each time he replied, &quot;More weight,&quot; and the sheriff complied. Occasionally, Corwin would even stand on the stones himself. Robert Calef, who was a witness along with other townsfolk, later said, &quot;In the pressing, Giles Corey&#x27;s tongue was pressed out of his mouth; the Sheriff, with his cane, forced it in again.&quot; There are several accounts of Corey&#x27;s last words. The most commonly told one is that he repeated his request for &quot;more weight,&quot; as this was how it was dramatized in &quot;The Crucible&quot;, but it may also have been &quot;More rocks&quot;. Another telling notes it as, &quot;Damn you. I curse you and Salem!&quot;
Samuel Sewall&#x27;s diary states, under the date of Monday, 19 September 1692:

It was and remains unusual for people to refuse to plead and extremely rare to find reports of people who have been able to endure this painful form of death in silence. Since Corey refused to plead, he died in full possession of his estate, which would otherwise have been forfeited to the government. It was passed on to his two sons-in-law in accordance with his will.

== Aftermath ==
Corey&#x27;s wife Martha was hanged three days later on 22 September 1692. She had a son from a previous marriage named Thomas; he showed up as a petitioner for loss and damages resulting from his mother being executed illegally during the witch trials. He was awarded £50 on 29 June 1723.

The gruesome and public nature of Corey&#x27;s death may have caused residents of Salem to rethink their support for the witch trials. Giles was absolved of the crime in 1712. Martha was not.

Although Corey&#x27;s refusal to plead meant that his estate was protected from seizure, it was reported that Sheriff Corwin nevertheless extorted his family by falsely claiming that he could still confiscate the property. In 1710, Corey&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth and her husband John Moulton filed a lawsuit seeking damages from Corwin&#x27;s estate. Her statement to the court read, &quot;After our father&#x27;s death, the sheriff threatened to seize our father&#x27;s estate, and for fear, that we complied with him and paid him eleven pounds six shillings in money.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Legends===
According to a local legend, the apparition of Corey appears and walks his graveyard each time a disaster is about to strike the city. Notably, he was said to have appeared the night before the Great Salem Fire of 1914. The position of Sheriff of Essex County was also said to have suffered from the &quot;curse of Giles Corey,&quot; as the holders of that office, since Corwin, had either died or resigned as a result of heart or blood ailments (Corwin died of a heart attack in 1696). The curse was said to have been broken when the sheriff&#x27;s office was moved from Salem to Middleton in 1991.

===Literature===
Corey is the subject of a Henry Wadsworth Longfellow play entitled &quot;Giles Corey of the Salem Farms&quot; and an 1893 play, &quot;Giles Corey, Yeoman&quot;, by Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman.

===Popular culture===
Corey is a character in Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1953), in which he is portrayed as a hot-tempered but honorable man, giving evidence critical to the witch trials. His wife Martha was one of the 19 people hanged during the hysteria on Proctor&#x27;s Ledge. In &quot;The Crucible&quot;, Giles feels guilty about his wife&#x27;s accusation because he had told a minister that Martha had been reading strange books, which was discouraged in that society. Corey also appears in Robert Ward&#x27;s operatic treatment of the play, in which his role is assigned to a tenor. A movie of the same name was released in 1996, featuring Peter Vaughan as Corey.

Actor Kevin Tighe portrayed Corey in the pilot episode of the WGN television series &quot;Salem&quot;, in which he is pressed to death in a more-or-less historically accurate manner.

Corey was the namesake behind one of Dan Barrett&#x27;s musical projects. The band&#x27;s music has been described as depressing.

<doc id="572923" wikidata="Q676861" url="?curid=572923" title="Lou Piniella">
<text>Louis Victor Piniella ( usually ; born August 28, 1943) is a former professional baseball player and manager. An outfielder, he played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Royals and New York Yankees. During his playing career, he was named AL Rookie of the Year in 1969 and captured two World Series championships with the Yankees (1977, 1978).

Following his playing career, Piniella became a manager for the Yankees (1986–1988), Cincinnati Reds (1990–1992), Seattle Mariners (1993–2002), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2003–2005), and Chicago Cubs (2007–2010). He won the 1990 World Series championship with the Reds and led the Mariners to four postseason appearances in seven years (including a record 116-win regular season in 2001). As the Mariners&#x27; manager, Piniella presided over the franchise&#x27;s most successful period. He also captured back-to-back division titles (2007–2008) during his time with the Cubs. 

Piniella was named Manager of the Year three times during his career (1995, 2001, 2008) and finished his managerial career ranked 14th all time on the list of managerial wins.

He was nicknamed &quot;Sweet Lou&quot;, both for his swing as a major league hitter and, facetiously, to describe his demeanor as a player and manager.

==Early life==
Piniella was born in Tampa, Florida. Though he is often mistaken for being Italian American, Piniella&#x27;s parents were of Asturian descent, from northwest Spain. He grew up in West Tampa, and played American Legion baseball and PONY League baseball alongside fellow future major league manager Tony La Russa. Piniella attended Jesuit High School in Tampa, where he played several sports and was an All-American in basketball. After graduation in 1961, he attended the University of Tampa for a year, where he was a College Division (today&#x27;s Division II) All-American in baseball for the Spartans.

==Playing career==
Piniella was signed by the Cleveland Indians at age 18 as an amateur free agent on June 9, 1962. That fall, he was drafted by the Washington Senators from the Indians in the 1962 first-year draft. On August 4, , Piniella was sent to the Baltimore Orioles to complete an earlier trade for Buster Narum. He made his major league debut that year on September 4 at the age of 21, appearing as a pinch hitter and grounding out in his first at bat. Prior to the 1966 season, he was traded back to the Indians for Cam Carreon. He spent three seasons with the Portland Beavers from 1966 to 1968. He returned to the majors with Cleveland near the end of the 1968 season, appearing in six games and going hitless in five at-bats with one RBI.

In the middle part of the decade, Piniella played winter baseball in Nicaragua.

Piniella was selected by the Seattle Pilots in the 1968 expansion draft in October, but was traded after spring training on April 1, 1969 to the Kansas City Royals for John Gelnar and Steve Whitaker. 
Piniella played with the Royals for their first five seasons (1969–1973) and was the American League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year in 1969 and was named to the 1972 All-Star Game. He was the first batter in Royals history; on April 8 of their first season in 1969, he led off the bottom of the first inning against left-hander Tom Hall of the Minnesota Twins. Piniella doubled to left field, then scored on an RBI single by Jerry Adair. On April 16, 1970, Piniella went 3-5 with a home run while accomplishing the rare feat of being thrown out at all four bases in the same game.

After the 1973 season, Piniella was traded by the Royals with Ken Wright to the New York Yankees for Lindy McDaniel. Baseball author Bill James called the trade the only clinker the Royals made during the 1970s. He played with the Yankees for 11 seasons, during which the Yankees won five AL East titles (1976–78, 1980, and 1981), four AL pennants (1976–78, and 1981), and two World Series championships (1977–78). In 1975, he missed part of the year with an inner ear infection. From mid-1977 through the end of 1980, he split his playing time between left field, right field, and designated hitter.

In his career, Piniella made one All-Star team and compiled 1,705 lifetime hits despite not playing full-time for just under half of his career. He received two votes for the Hall of Fame as a player in 1990.

==Coaching and front office career==

===New York Yankees===

While he was still an active player, Piniella served on the Yankees coaching staff as the hitting coach. On October 28, 1985, he accepted an offer to become the Yankees&#x27; manager. His initial managerial contract for 1986 was for $200,000. Piniella managed the Yankees from 1986 to 1987; promoted to general manager to start the 1988 season, he took over as manager after the firing of Billy Martin (in his fifth and final run as Yankee manager) on June 23. Combining both stints as Yankees manager, he posted 224 wins and 193 losses.

===Cincinnati Reds===
The Cincinnati Reds let go of Tommy Helms after he managed the last 37 games of the 1989 season (marred by the permanent ban of player-manager Pete Rose). October 13 saw the hiring of former Yankee front officeman Bob Quinn as general manager. Piniella was hired by the Reds on November 3, 1989 on a three-year deal for $350,000 after getting approval from Steinbrenner to be released from the personal services contract that paid Piniella $400,000 each for two years. Piniella managed the Cincinnati Reds from 1990 through 1992 with a 3-year contract worth $1.05 million. In his first year, the Reds won the World Series in a four-game sweep of the favored defending champion Oakland Athletics. The sweep over a team with 12 wins more than the 91-win Reds was considered a massive shock, and it was the first Reds title since 1976. Piniella&#x27;s honeymoon with the Reds would not last long. Wracked with injuries and a less effective bullpen that saw the team lose ten games in a row in July, the Reds finished with the worst winning percentage for a defending World Series champion, a dubious mark later surpassed by the 1998 Florida Marlins and 2014 Boston Red Sox. 

The most noted moment was an outburst by Piniella in an August game. Umpire Gary Darling overturned a call that cost the Reds a home run, and after the game, Piniella accused Darling of being biased against the Reds. Two months later, Darling and the Major League Umpires Association sued for defamation to the tune of $5 million against Piniella. When he asked owner Marge Schott for help, she did not budge on helping with paying for a lawyer, which Piniella had to do out of his own pocket. While he stated that realized his own error in making the statement against Darling, the fact that he received no backing from the Reds played a key part in him not wanting to manage there. The lawsuit ended in compromise, with Piniella issuing a statement.

Following his third season with the Reds, Piniella announced in October that he had rejected a contract extension. He finished with a record of 255 wins and 231 losses. He was replaced by Tony Pérez, who was fired 44 games into the 1993 season for Davey Johnson. Since Piniella&#x27;s departure, the Reds have won only one postseason series.

===Seattle Mariners===
Under a new ownership group, Piniella was introduced as the new manager of the Mariners in November 1992 and led the Seattle Mariners for ten seasons (1993–2002). His wife Anita initially insisted he not take the job. They lived in New Jersey in Allendale, and she thought Seattle was too far away from their family and children, and spring training was in Arizona instead of Florida. His initial contract in Seattle was for $2.5 million over three years, significantly more than his predecessor, Bill Plummer, who had a two-year $500,000 contract.

On August 18, 1999, Piniella won his 1,000th game (having managed 1,926 in total) in a 5–1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.

Piniella won the AL Manager of the Year Award in 1995, and again in 2001, when he led the Mariners to a record-tying 116 wins. After winning the 2001 AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians, the Mariners dropped the first two games of the AL Championship Series to the New York Yankees, and Piniella held an angry post-game press conference in which he guaranteed the Mariners would win two out of three games in New York to return the ALCS to Seattle. However, the Yankees closed out the series at Yankee Stadium, and the Mariners would not reach the postseason again until 2022. Following the 2002 season, Piniella requested out of his final year with the Mariners to manage the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. As compensation, the Devil Rays traded outfielder Randy Winn to the Mariners for infield prospect Antonio Pérez.

Piniella finished with a record of 840 wins and 711 losses. All four of the Mariners&#x27; playoff appearances in team history to that point were under Piniella. On August 9, 2014, Piniella was inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===
Piniella returned to the Tampa area in October 2002, taking over for a team that had just finished at under Hal McRae. In his first two seasons with the Devil Rays, Piniella was able to improve the team somewhat, and they won a franchise-record 70 games in 2004. This was also the first season in which they did not finish last in their division.

During the 2005 season, Piniella was critical of the Devil Rays&#x27; front office for focusing too much on the future and not enough on immediate results, and for not increasing payroll quickly enough to field a competitive team. The Devil Rays started the season with a $30 million payroll, which was the lowest in the major leagues; the Yankees payroll in 2005 was over $208 million. Tensions eventually made Piniella step down as the Devil Rays&#x27; manager on September 21. He finished with a record of 200 wins and 285 losses. He had a season remaining on his four-year $13 million contract from October 2002, but agreed to a $2.2 million buyout, in lieu of $4.4 million that he was due for a fourth season. He would have also received $1.25 million in deferred salary from 2003.

===Chicago Cubs===
On October 16, , Piniella agreed to a three-year contract to manage the Chicago Cubs for $10 million with a $5 million option for a fourth year in 2010.

Though Piniella&#x27;s Cubs won the Central Division in his first two years (2007–2008), and boasted the best record in the NL in 2008, the Cubs were swept in the postseason both years, first by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 2007 NLDS and then the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2008 NLDS. Piniella was named NL Manager of the Year for 2008.
In 2010, Piniella announced on July 20 his intention to retire as manager of the Cubs at season&#x27;s end. However, on August 22, Piniella decided to resign after that day&#x27;s game, stating that he wanted to care for his ailing 90-year-old mother. He finished with a record of 316 wins and 293 losses.

===San Francisco Giants===
On February 2, 2011, Piniella was hired by the San Francisco Giants as a special consultant. He did not return to that position after the season.

===Return to Cincinnati Reds===
On February 5, 2016, Piniella rejoined the Cincinnati Reds as a special consultant.

==Managerial record==
==Broadcasting career==
In 1989, Piniella worked as a color analyst for Yankees telecasts on MSG Network. After parting ways with the Devil Rays in 2005, Piniella was an analyst for Fox Sports, first joining Joe Buck and Tim McCarver calling the 2005 American League Championship Series. He was then an analyst with the network for the 2006 season, and also joined Thom Brennaman and Steve Lyons for the postseason.

On February 22, 2012, it was announced Piniella would join the YES Network as an analyst for Yankees games. He made his YES debut on March 4 during a Yankees-Phillies spring training game. He left the network after the season.

==Personal life==
Piniella married his wife Anita (Garcia) in 1967, and together they have three children. 

Piniella suffered what was described as a &quot;mini-stroke&quot; in June 2017, but sufficiently recovered to resume his role as senior advisor to baseball operations with the Cincinnati Reds for the 2018 season.

==Hall of Fame consideration==
Piniella has been a candidate for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee three times, in 2016, 2018, and 2023 but has thus far failed to be elected. In 2018 he received 11 of a required 12 votes for the 2019 induction class. On the ballot for December 2023, he again received eleven votes, one short of induction.

==In other media==
Piniella made a cameo appearance in the 1994 film &quot;Little Big League&quot;.

In late 2007, Piniella appeared in a television commercial for Aquafina bottled water in which he parodies his famous June 2, 2007 meltdown at Wrigley Field.

Piniella and Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén appeared in one commercial to advertise a local car dealership during the first half of the 2008 Crosstown series. The creators of the commercial used their likeness in three other commercials, which featured stunt doubles riding bicycles and jumping rope.

In 2009, Piniella did a commercial for DirecTV and in 2018, commercials in the Seattle area for Sustainable Housing for Ageless Generations (SHAG), formerly Senior Housing Assistance Group, a non-profit senior citizen affordable living organization.

<text>The Cat in the Hat Comes Back is a 1958 children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by American author Theodor Geisel under his pen name Dr. Seuss. Published by Random House as one of its five original Beginner Books, it is the sequel to &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; (1957). In the book, the Cat in the Hat leaves a pink stain in the bathtub and spreads it around the house while cleaning it. He unveils a series of increasingly small cats from beneath his hat until the smallest one lifts his hat and unleashes a force called Voom that cleans all of the pink stain. The book uses under 300 distinct words with a plot inspired by Geisel&#x27;s earlier story &quot;The Strange Shirt Spot&quot; (1951). It reuses several aspects of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, such as poor weather preventing the children from playing and the absence of an adult figure. The children are quicker to confront the Cat compared to the first book, and the character of Sally engages more with other characters instead of staying silent. &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; was well-received but did not garner as much critical praise as &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. A film adaptation was planned but ultimately canceled after the failure of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; (2003).

== Plot ==
A boy and his sister Sally are shoveling snow while their mother is out. The Cat in the Hat arrives, and Sally reminds her brother about the tricks the Cat played during his last visit. The Cat promises he only wants to go inside to get out of the snow, but they find him eating cake in a tub. The boy turns off the water, but a pink stain is left along the side of the tub. The Cat uses their mother&#x27;s dress to clean it, staining the dress pink. The Cat tries new methods to clean the pink spot, wiping it onto a wall, a shoe, a rug, and a bed. 

To get help, Cat lifts his hat and a smaller version of himself, Little Cat A, comes out. Little Cat A lifts his hat to let out a smaller cat, Little Cat B, who then lifts his hat to let out Little Cat C. They move the pink spot to a broom and a television set before blowing it out of the house with a fan. It stains the snow, so Little Cat C takes off his hat to let out Little Cat D, who lets out Little Cat E, who lets out Little Cat F, who lets out Little Cat G. They play in the snow and make a bigger mess of the pink spot, so they let out little cats H through V, each smaller than the last. They play until all of the snow is pink, so they let out little cats X, Y, and Z. Little Cat Z is microscopic, but he lifts his hat to let out the Voom, which cleans the pink from the snow and puts the little cats back in the Cat&#x27;s hat. 

== Writing and publication ==
&quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; is a sequel to the book &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; by Theodor Geisel. He did not wish to write a sequel, especially as he was more focused on his work running the Beginner Books imprint, but there was an unspoken implication from his publisher that a sequel was expected for such a popular book. Geisel wrote &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; at his home in La Jolla. He incorporated elements of his short story &quot;The Strange Shirt Spot&quot; (1951) when writing &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot;. The images of the Cat in the bathtub are reminiscent of his political cartoons from the early-1940s which feature vulnerable characters in bathtubs. Geisel discarded six drafts of possible sequels for &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; before settling on what became &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot;. Little of his draft work was preserved, with no existing color-pencil sketches.

Geisel drew from a list of 348 words, selecting them from a list of words appropriate for early readers with the exception of &quot;Voom&quot;. Depending on how a distinct word is defined, the final draft used 253, 266, or 290 words. There are only four three-syllable words in &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot;: &quot;anything&quot;, &quot;somebodies&quot;, &quot;somebody&quot;, and &quot;W&quot;. Another 26 words were two-syllables. The most common words are &quot;the&quot; with 87 uses followed by &quot;and&quot; and &quot;cat&quot; with 54 uses each. While no words beginning with Q or Z appear in &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; features the letters as standalone names of two characters along with the other letters. Geisel made use of S-shaped curves throughout the book, including the Cat&#x27;s path when skiing, the rug as it is moved, and the tails of the little cats.

&quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; was published in 1958. It was one of the original five books published in the Beginner Books line, along with &quot;A Big Ball of String&quot; by Marion Holland, &quot;The Big Jump and Other Stories&quot; by Benjamin Elkin and Katherine Evans, &quot;A Fly Went By&quot; by Michael McClintock, and &quot;Sam and the Firefly&quot; by P. D. Eastman. Geisel&#x27;s book was the most popular of the group. He immediately began working on &quot;Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories&quot; while &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; was prepared for publication. To promote the two books, Geisel went on a tour for book signing, which was an unusual marketing strategy for children&#x27;s books at the time.

&quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; was the first of Giesel&#x27;s books to feature the &quot;I can read it all by myself&quot; logo of the Beginner Books series, which was then added to future printings of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. The original cover art featured an image on page six where the Cat walks up a snowy hill, but it was tilted so that the Cat appeared to walk on level ground. This design had the title printed in blue text, used the original Beginner Books logo, and erroneously had the Cat wearing a white bowtie instead of a red one. After it had already sold 100,000 copies, Geisel decided that a line on the cover was drawn too dark and that a new cover needed to be printed. Subsequent editions used a solid blue background and the updated Beginner Books logo, which itself featured the Cat. Seuss was unhappy with the first printing, feeling that the colors bled too much in some places and that the black lines were not crisp enough. The title page of &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; includes an exclamation point in the title, but the cover does not. This contrasts with &quot;On Beyond Zebra!&quot; and &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;, where exclamation points appeared on the cover but were omitted on the title page.

== Literary analysis ==
&quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; mirrors and contrasts with its predecessor. Both take place at the same house, but the first takes place entirely indoors on a rainy day while the second moves in and out of the house on a snowy day. Like the original, &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; begins with the children unable to play, but it is because they are busy shoveling snow outside instead of rain keeping them inside. The Cat&#x27;s tone shifts from one of carelessness in the first book, saying that their mother will not mind his antics, to deception as he tells the children their parents will never know of his actions. The plot of &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; is dependent on the absence of an adult figure—a common theme in Dr. Seuss books, including its predecessor &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. The two children are more alert to chaos caused by the Cat in &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; relative to the original, telling him off immediately instead of waiting until the end of the book. Sally takes on what would be the mother&#x27;s role, warning the narrator about the Cat. Here she replaces the Fish, who played this role in the first book. This deviates from the first book, in which Sally was a silent observer. The Cat&#x27;s possession of hats underneath his hat is reminiscent of Geisel&#x27;s earlier book &quot;The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins&quot; (1938), which centers on this premise.

&quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; teaches the letters of the alphabet. This foreshadows one of Geisel&#x27;s later books, &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27;s ABC&quot;, which also demonstrates the alphabet in a whimsical fashion. English professor George R. Bodmer categorizes these, along with Geisel&#x27;s &quot;On Beyond Zebra!&quot; (1955), as examples of &quot;anti-alphabet&quot; books. &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; explores how different spellings can produce the same sounds with the words &quot;news&quot;, &quot;shoes&quot;, &quot;use&quot;, and &quot;whose&quot;. Geisel used the removal of the spot from various objects to add several nouns into the book, borrowing the technique from the first book where the cat juggles several objects.

Children&#x27;s literature professor Philip Nel noted the frequent refrain of &quot;work to be done&quot; in &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; and suggested that it came from Geisel&#x27;s own beliefs about hard work. Nel suggested that descriptions of the Cat&#x27;s mischief in &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; were drawn from a passage in &quot;The Bad Child&#x27;s Book of Beasts&quot; (1896) by Hilaire Belloc, whom Geisel described as an influence on his work. Literature professor Lois Einhorn cited the Cat&#x27;s return and the title of the book as an example of circularity found in the works of Dr. Seuss, as well of his plot structure of order, disorder, and then return to order. Einhorn compared the Voom to atomic energy and the pink stain as communism, both of which were major concerns of the world at the time of publication. Feminist professor Naomi Goldenberg symbolized the Cat removing the spot from their father&#x27;s bed as removing their mother&#x27;s role in their conception, and the creation of his own little cats as putting men&#x27;s production of language above women&#x27;s birth of children. &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; was published amid the Red Scare, and academics such as Robert Coover, Louis Menand, and Philip Nel have compared the pink spots to communism, either in the context of the Cat spreading communism or using the Voom as an atomic weapon to destroy it. Engineer Akhlesh Lakhtakia suggested that the small cats are an example of fractals, but mathematician Michael Frame challenged this because each layer has only a single new iteration of the cat and instead likened them to Matryoshka dolls. As one of several examples of physically small characters making the most difference in his stories, Geisel depicts Z, the smallest character in the book, as the one with the solution that resolves the story.

Geisel incorporated a conversational tone into &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot;. He used contractions and exclamations, and he spoke directly to the reader with the phrase &quot;Now, don&#x27;t ask me what Voom is, I never will know.&quot; The picture of the Cat entering the home uses its composition to build tension. The children are drawn at a distance from the Cat as he enters so that it is a greater challenge to stop him, and Sally&#x27;s shovel is positioned in a way that snow is about to drop from it onto her head. The mother and father have separate bedrooms in the characters&#x27; home. The father has a double bed with a blue headboard, while the first book shows the mother has a single bed with a pink headboard. &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; is the first of Geisel&#x27;s children&#x27;s books to depict a television set, corresponding with the increasing popularity of television at the time.

An earlier draft of the book had the little cats act as extensions of the original Cat, repeating what he says. Geisel changed this by having the little cats say they would think on the issue, implying independence from the Cat. The little cats are quicker to express their mischievous nature as well, with a draft showing them leap over Sally&#x27;s head out the door before they begin playing in the snow. One of the playing cats uses a device identical to the FLIT insecticide for which Geisel created had a popular advertising campaign in 1928. The scene escalates as it goes on, with the white snow turning entirely pink, a smiling snowman adopting a frowning face as it is destroyed, and a bird being almost entirely covered in the pink snow. The bird becomes happy again after the snow is cleaned, presenting a common technique of Geisel&#x27;s to have silent observers indicate the emotional tone of the scene. The imagery of the cats playing in the snow draws from &quot;The Brownies&quot; as drawn by Palmer Cox.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; was positively received. Critics viewed it as an excellent book for early readers, though it was considered slightly inferior to the first. &quot;Booklist&quot; and E.C. Mann of &quot;The Chicago Sunday Tribune&quot; celebrated the book for its humor. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; praised both its humor and its rhythm, complimenting how it combined this with a simple vocabulary. Warren T. Greenleaf of the National Association of Elementary School Principles said that &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; is among Geisel&#x27;s strongest books in terms of plot structure. Ellen Lewis Buell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented positively on how the action builds throughout the story. Literature professor Donald E. Pease criticized the book as a rehash of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. Geisel himself felt that it was not as good as the original. A list published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; as the 7th best-selling children&#x27;s book in the year of its release. &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; ranked 26th in a 2001 list by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; of all-time best-selling children&#x27;s hardcover books in the United States. It was the 7th best-selling book by Dr. Seuss on this list.

Although the Cat indicates he may return again at the end of the story, Geisel never wrote a sequel to &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot;. Instead, the Cat was used in a variety of other projects such as &quot;The Cat in the Hat Songbook&quot; (1967), &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Quizzer&quot; (1976), and &quot;I Can Read with My Eyes Shut!&quot; (1978), as well as adaptations of Seuss&#x27;s characters in other media. The song &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot; (1992) by R.E.M. references &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; with the line &quot;The Cat in the Hat came back, wrecked a lot of havoc on the way, always had a smile and a reason to pretend&quot;. A film adaptation of &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; was planned as a sequel to &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; (2003), but after the first film&#x27;s critical failure, Geisel&#x27;s widow Audrey Geisel decided not to allow any more live-action adaptations of her husband&#x27;s works.

<text>The Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) was a professional ice hockey league in Western Canada and the Western United States, which operated from 1911 to 1924 when it then merged with the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). The PCHA was considered to be a major league of ice hockey and was important in the development of the sport of professional ice hockey through its innovations.

The league was started by the Patrick family, professional hockey players from Montreal, building new arenas in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. After a few years of play, the league was accepted by the Stanley Cup trustees as being of a high enough standard that teams from its league were accepted for Stanley Cup challenges. Starting in 1915, the league entered into an agreement where the Stanley Cup was to be contested between the National Hockey Association and the PCHA after the regular seasons were finished. The league struggled to make money, and various teams moved into different cities in an attempt to be successful financially. Eventually, the league, to survive, merged with the WCHL in 1924.

== History ==
After playing for the Renfrew Millionaires in 1910, the brothers Frank and Lester Patrick moved west to Nelson, British Columbia to work in their father Joe&#x27;s lumbering business. Lester and Frank had both played with the Nelson Hockey Club in the West Kootenay Hockey League priorly, during the 1908–09 season. After Joe Patrick decided to sell the business in January 1911, the Patricks decided then to form a new professional ice hockey league, risking the family fortune. The decision was made to put new rinks in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, locations which necessitated the use of artificial ice, as the locations&#x27; climate prevented natural ice. Three teams: the New Westminster Royals, the Victoria Senators, and the Vancouver Millionaires would be formed. The Patricks moved quickly, buying property for the arenas in February. Ground was broken for the arenas in April and the arenas were completed in December. Victoria&#x27;s arena seated 4,000, and cost $110,000 and the flagship arena in Vancouver had 10,500 seats and cost $210,000 to build.

Once it became clear that the arenas would be built in time, the Patricks raided the National Hockey Association (NHA) for players, although with only three teams and no substitutes, the entire league only had 23 players under contract (including two reserves in case of injury). All players were paid by the league, unlike the NHA with its competing teams. The PCHA distributed players amongst the teams. Newsy Lalonde of the Canadiens would be the most notable player to move west, to play for Vancouver. The league was formally organized on December 7, 1911 to be run by Frank and Lester, who would also play for and manage the Vancouver and Victoria teams. The Victoria arena would open to the public on Christmas Day 1911, and the first game of the PCHA was played on January 3, 1912, only a year after the Patricks decided to form the new league. The first league championship for the Patterson Cup trophy was won by the New Westminster Royals.
The league did not challenge for the Stanley Cup the first year. Despite the raiding of the NHA, a March 1912 west coast tour of the NHA&#x27;s all-stars was arranged, billed as a sort of &quot;World Series&quot; of hockey. The NHA all-stars included Cyclone Taylor, a marquee name in the East, who had injured his hand refereeing a benefit game for Bruce Ridpath before coming out west and didn&#x27;t play the first two games. After the PCHA all-stars won the first two games 10–4 and 5–1, leaving the series outcome in no doubt, the NHA manager Art Ross decided to let Taylor play at the Patrick&#x27;s request. Taylor would put on an outstanding display of ice hockey prowess for the British Columbia fans and receive a two-minute ovation. Taylor, already rumoured to have signed with Vancouver, would later turn down a contract offer of the Ottawa Hockey Club of the NHA to join the Millionaires in December 1912 for a yearly salary of $1,800, the top salary of any player at the time.

For the 1912–13 season the PCHA continued to raid the east for players. Besides Taylor, Goldie Prodgers, Eddie Oatman, Jack McDonald and Ernie Johnson moved out west, although Newsy Lalonde returned to Montreal. The New Westminster rink, to be built by local interests, was not ready and the Royals continued to play in Vancouver. Victoria would win the season and the club arranged for an exhibition series of the Stanley Cup champion Quebec Bulldogs. Victoria would defeat the Bulldogs, two victories to one.

During the 1913–14 season, the PCHA and the NHA started to act together, coming to agreements to recognize each other&#x27;s player suspensions and contracts, and instituting a controlled &quot;draft&quot; process to facilitate the transfer of players. In a further agreement, the champions of each league would face each other for the Stanley Cup. After the 1914 season, league champion Victoria came east to play the first &quot;World Series of hockey&quot; challenge series with the Toronto Blueshirts for the Stanley Cup. After the series, the Stanley Cup trustees came to agreement with the NHA and PCHA and the challenge era of the Stanley Cup came to an end. Yearly playoffs between the leagues would become the new manner of deciding the Stanley Cup champion. In the 1914–15 season, Vancouver defeated the Ottawa Senators in a best-of-five series to become the PCHA&#x27;s first Stanley Cup champions.

The league expanded into the United States in 1914 (Portland, Oregon) and again in 1915 (Seattle, Washington). In 1916, the Portland Rosebuds became the first American team to play for the Stanley Cup and the following year the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup—forever changing the mandate of the Cup, which had initially been to recognize the top hockey club in Canada.

Relations with the NHA turned sour in 1915, with the Patricks accusing the league of reneging on their agreements. In retaliation, the PCHA again went on a raid for NHA players, particularly ones with the Toronto Blueshirts. Five players from Toronto became the core of the new Seattle team.

In 1918, the PCHA introduced playoffs for the first time. Until that year, the team with the best record over the season had been declared the champion and challenged for the Stanley Cup. With the creation of playoffs, it was the winner in the post-season who would be league champion.

In 1921, the Western Canada Hockey League, another western major league of hockey, was formed, and the Stanley Cup playoffs were modified to include teams from the WCHL. The following two years, which would turn out to be the last two years of the PCHA, the league played interleague games with the WCHL. In the last year of the PCHA, all three remaining teams finished with losing records.

In 1924, the Seattle Metropolitans folded, and the two remaining teams in Vancouver and Victoria joined the WCHL (renamed the Western Hockey League), putting an end to the PCHA. The Victoria Cougars would win the Stanley Cup in 1925, but this win would be the last by a non-NHL team, and the last by a team from the west coast until the Anaheim Ducks won the Stanley Cup in 2007.

The merged league did not last long, as the WHL was unable to match the NHL&#x27;s American expansion and its player salaries, which led the Patrick brothers to sell players or, in the case of the Portland Rosebuds and the Victoria Cougars, the team itself. The expansion Chicago Black Hawks bought the Rosebud players for a reported $15,000, while the expansion Detroit team bought the Victoria players for $25,000 and named itself the Detroit Cougars in tribute; this team became the present-day Detroit Red Wings.

==Innovations==
The league introduced numerous innovations to the sport of ice hockey:
* blue lines and goal creases
* forward passing
* penalty shots
* playoffs
* removed rule that goalies must stay on their feet

The PCHA also developed a farm system for players, and were the first Canadian league to expand into the United States.

The PCHA is also credited with introducing numbers to player sweaters for identification purposes (starting in 1911–12), but this had also been experimented with in the NHA at the same time.

Among professional ice hockey leagues in North America, the PCHA was the last to play &quot;seven-man hockey&quot;, which included the rover position. In 1923, the PCHA decided to drop the rover position, as it was seen to be crowding the ice and therefore reducing the speed of play.

==Women&#x27;s ice hockey==

As early as January 1916, Frank and Lester Patrick talked of the formation of a women&#x27;s league to complement the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The proposal included teams from Vancouver, Victoria, Portland and Seattle. The league never formed.

In February 1921, Frank Patrick announced a women&#x27;s international championship series that would be played in conjunction with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The three teams that competed were the Vancouver Amazons, Victoria Kewpies, and Seattle Vamps.

On February 21, 1921, the Seattle Vamps competed against the Vancouver Amazons in Vancouver, and were vanquished by a 5–0 score. Two days later, the Vamps played against a team from the University of British Columbia and won the game. Jerry Reed scored three goals (a hat trick) in the game for the Vamps. In both games, the Vancouver media referred to the Seattle team as the Seattle Sweeties. The Amazons would travel to Seattle and defeat them again. On March 2, 1921, the Vamps were defeated by the Kewpies 1–0 in Seattle. In the rematch on March 12, the Vamps travelled to Victoria. The result was a 1–1 tie, and Jerry Reed scored the goal for Seattle. The goaltender for the Vamps was Mildren Terran. After the 1921 season, the Vamps and the Kewpies ceased operations.

<doc id="572954" wikidata="Q1148022" url="?curid=572954" title="Edgar Martínez">
<text>Edgar Martínez (born January 2, 1963), nicknamed &quot;Gar&quot; and &quot;Papi&quot;, is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball player who is currently the senior director of hitting strategy coach for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB as a designated hitter and third baseman for Seattle from 1987 to 2004. He served as the Mariners&#x27; hitting coach from 2015 to 2018, and currently in 2024. He has also been a hitting advisor with the Mariners from 2019 through 2024.

Martínez grew up in Dorado, Puerto Rico. Not highly regarded as a prospect, he signed with the Mariners as a free agent in 1982, and was given a small signing bonus. He made his major league debut in 1987, but did not establish himself as a full-time player until 1990, at age 27. In the 1995 American League Division Series, he hit &quot;The Double&quot;, which won the series and increased public support for Mariners baseball as they attempted to fund a new stadium. He continued to play until 2004, when injuries forced him to retire.

Martínez was a seven-time MLB All-Star, five-time Silver Slugger, and two-time batting champion. He is one of 18 MLB players to record a batting average of .300, an on-base percentage of .400, and a slugging percentage of .500 in 5,000 or more plate appearances. The Mariners retired his uniform number 11 and inducted him into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame. In 2019, Martínez was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Martínez was born in New York City on January 2, 1963, to José and Christina Salgado Martinez, who were from Puerto Rico. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and he was taken in by his grandparents, who lived in the barrio of Maguayo in Dorado, Puerto Rico. Martínez taught himself how to speak English and how to use computers. When he was 11 years old, his parents reconciled. His brother and sister returned to New York to live with their parents, but Edgar opted to remain in Dorado with his grandparents.

Martinez became inspired to play baseball after watching fellow Puerto Rican Roberto Clemente play in the 1971 World Series. He played with his cousin Carmelo Martínez in the backyard of his home. Scouts watched Carmelo with interest, but Edgar did not draw their attention. He attended the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, studying business administration. He played semiprofessional baseball and worked two jobs, as a supervisor in a furniture store by day and in a General Electric factory at night.

==Playing career==
===Prospect===
At the suggestion of the owner of his semiprofessional team, Martínez attended a tryout held by the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB). Despite nearly missing the tryout after a long night working at the factory and being &quot;so tired [he] couldn&#x27;t swing the bat,&quot; the Mariners signed him to a contract with a $4,000 signing bonus (a small amount at the time) on December 12, 1982. He initially considered declining the offer, due to the money he was making in Puerto Rico, but Carmelo convinced him to sign.

Martínez made his professional debut in Minor League Baseball with the Bellingham Mariners of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League in 1983 as a third baseman. He had a .173 batting average, zero home runs and only 18 hits. The scout who signed Martínez convinced Hal Keller, the Mariners&#x27; general manager, to assign him to the Arizona Instructional League (AIL) after the season. Keller did not believe Martínez would be able to hit in the major leagues, and initially did not want to assign him to the AIL, which is reserved for the best prospects. Keller included Martínez in the AIL that year, where he batted .340.

In 1984, Martínez batted .303 with 15 home runs and 84 walks for the Wausau Timbers of the Class A Midwest League. Martínez played for the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Class AA Southern League and Calgary Cannons of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1985, batting .258 in 111 games for Chattanooga and .353 in 20 games for Calgary. He returned to Chattanooga in 1986 and had a .960 fielding percentage, which led all third basemen. Playing for Calgary in 1987, Martínez had a .327 batting average, 10 home runs, and 31 doubles in 129 games. He led Calgary in batting average, as well as hits, doubles, batting average, on base percentage, games played, and walks.

===Early career (1987–1989)===
Martínez made his major league debut on September 12, 1987, as a third baseman, and proceeded to hit .372 over his first 13 career games. However, the Mariners were committed to using Jim Presley as their third baseman. In 1988, Martínez began the season with Calgary, but was called up to the major leagues in early May. He played in four games with the Mariners before being returned to Calgary, where he hit .363, the best batting average in the PCL. In September he was called up again, and over 10 games hit .389. In his second MLB season, he hit .281 with a .351 on-base percentage (OBP) and a .406 slugging percentage over 14 games.

The Mariners named Martínez their starting third baseman on their Opening Day roster in 1989. He struggled and was sent back down to Calgary in May. He hit .345 over 32 games for the Cannons and .240 in 65 games for the Mariners in 1989. After the regular season, Martínez played winter baseball in the Puerto Rican Baseball League. He batted .424 in 43 games, leading the league, and was named co-MVP with Carlos Baerga.

===First seasons and batting title (1990–1992)===
In 1990, Martínez signed a one-year contract for $90,000. Though Presley was no longer a Mariner, Darnell Coles began the season as the Mariners&#x27; starting third baseman, with manager Jim Lefebvre telling &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; during spring training: &quot;I think Darnell Coles is going to surprise a lot of people. He knows there is no one in the wings, just Edgar Martinez to back him up.&quot; However, Coles committed five errors in Seattle&#x27;s first six games. Lefebvre moved Coles to the outfield and began playing Martínez at third base. Over 144 games, Martínez hit .302, and had a .397 on-base percentage, both of which led the team.

Martínez signed a two-year contract worth $850,000 before the 1991 season. In 1991, he won his first MLB Player of the Week Award for the week ending July 14. He finished the 1991 season hitting .307/.405/.452, all career highs. In 1992, Martínez was selected to his first All-Star Game, and won his first MLB Player of the Month Award for July and his second for August, During the season, Martínez signed a three-year contract with Seattle worth $10 million, the largest contract given out by Seattle to that point. At the end of the 1992 season, Martínez had a .343 batting average, which led all of MLB. It was the first batting title for Seattle and the franchise&#x27;s highest single-season batting average (this has since been surpassed by Ichiro Suzuki). He also tied Frank Thomas for the most doubles in MLB, and set a team record for most in a season (this has since been surpassed by Alex Rodriguez). After the season, he was awarded his first American League (AL) Silver Slugger Award as a third baseman.

===Injuries (1993–1994)===
During an exhibition game at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, before the 1993 season, Martínez tore his hamstring on an unzipped seam in the turf between first and second base. He missed 42 games at the start of the season, and was placed on the disabled list two more times before the season ended. In 1994, in his first plate appearance of the season, opposing pitcher Dennis Martínez hit him in the right wrist, and he was placed on the disabled list. Between the injuries and the 1994 MLB strike, he played in 131 games during the 1993 and 1994 seasons. In 89 games played in 1994, he played 65 games as a third baseman and 23 as a designated hitter, with one appearance as a pinch runner.

===Career year (1995)===
Martínez became a full-time designated hitter in 1995. He won the Player of the Month Award for June, hitting .402 with a .537 OBP and a .761 SLG, and another Player of the Week Award. He was also selected to the 1995 All-Star Game and set career highs in eleven offensive categories. At the end of the year he won his second AL batting title with a team record .356, while also leading the league in runs scored with 121, doubles with 52, OBP with .479 and on-base plus slugging (OPS) with 1.109 (all team highs at that point). He also finished third in AL Most Valuable Player Award voting behind Mo Vaughn and Albert Belle. He won his second Silver Slugger Award and his first Outstanding Designated Hitter Award.

====The Double====
In the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the New York Yankees, Martínez hit .571 and was on base 18 times in five games. In Game 4 of that series, he hit a three-run home run, then a grand slam home run that broke a 6–6 tie, en route to an 11–8 victory. His seven runs batted in (RBIs) in that game tied a single-game postseason record. The win knotted the best-of-five series at two games apiece and forced Game 5. Down 5–4 in the 11th inning of that decisive game, Martínez hit a two-run double off Jack McDowell, winning the game for the Mariners, 6–5, and series, 3–2. The win sent the Mariners to the American League Championship Series for the first time in franchise history, against the Cleveland Indians, a series they would eventually lose in six games.

The double entered baseball lore, referred to as &quot;The Double&quot;, by Mariners fans. The Mariners&#x27; 1995 postseason run helped build the groundswell of public support that led the Washington State Legislature to enact legislation to fund a dedicated baseball stadium in Seattle to replace the Kingdome. Mariners&#x27; manager Lou Piniella referred to it as &quot;the hit, the run, the game, the series and the season that saved baseball in Seattle.&quot;

===Continued success (1996–2001)===

In 1996, Martínez batted .327 and was selected for the 1996 MLB All-Star Game. He played one game at third base during the season, during which he collided with John Marzano, breaking four ribs and missing 21 games. On August 21, 1996, Martínez recorded his 1,000th career MLB hit. Martínez was selected to the 1997 MLB All-Star Game and won the Silver Slugger Award at the end of the 1997 season. He finished second in the AL with a .330 average. The Mariners made the 1997 ALDS, but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in four games. Martínez batted .188 in the series. He won his second Outstanding Designated Hitter Award. In 1998, Martínez batted .320 with 29 home runs. He led the AL with a .429 OBP, and won his third Outstanding Designated Hitter Award.

In 1999, Martínez was diagnosed with strabismus, a condition which causes the eyes to not properly align. For Martínez, his right eye would intermittently drift and cause him to lose depth perception. For the 1999 season, he led the AL with a .447 OBP and batted .337. He recorded his 1,500th hit on August 14. In 2000, Martínez earned his fifth All-Star Game selection. He hit 37 home runs, his single-season best, and led the American League with 145 RBIs. The Mariners reached the postseason, and Martínez batted .364 in the 2000 ALDS, defeating the Chicago White Sox. The Mariners lost to the Yankees in the 2000 American League Championship Series (ALCS). Martínez finished sixth in AL MVP Award balloting, and won the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award.

In 2001, Martínez was again elected to the All-Star Game. He batted .306 with 116 RBIs, his tenth season with a .300 or better batting average (his seventh consecutive) and his sixth season with 100 RBIs. Seattle tied the major league record set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs with 116 wins on the season. Martínez hit .313 with two home runs in the 2001 ALDS as Seattle defeated Cleveland, but he batted .150 in the 2001 ALCS as they lost to the Yankees. He won the Silver Slugger Award and the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award in 2001.

===Later career (2002–2004)===
Martínez dealt with leg injuries in 2002, playing in 97 games. He left a game after pulling his hamstring and had surgery to repair a ruptured tendon in his left knee. Though he was batting .301 on September 8, he entered a slump late in the season and ended the year with a .277 batting average. In 2003, Martínez again dealt with hamstring injuries. He batted .304 in the first half of the season and was named to the 2003 MLB All-Star Game. On May 2, Martínez had his 2,000th career hit. He broke a toe when it was hit by a foul ball in September, which limited him until the end of the season. He ended the season with a .294 batting average, 24 home runs, and a .403 OBP. He won his fifth Silver Slugger Award in 2003.

In 2004, Martínez struggled with a sore back, leg injuries, and difficulties with his eyesight. The Mariners struggled, falling out of the postseason chase, and the team began to give playing time at designated hitter to Bucky Jacobsen. On August 9, 2004, Martínez announced his retirement, effective at the end of the season. Martínez said this about his choice of retiring and career in Seattle:
Martínez won the Roberto Clemente Award after the 2004 season.

===Career statistics===
In 2055 games over 18 seasons, Martinez posted a .312 batting average (2247-for-7213) with 1219 runs, 514 doubles, 15 triples, 309 home runs, 1261 RBI, 49 stolen bases, 1283 walks, .418 on-base percentage, and .515 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded an overall .952 fielding percentage primarily as a third baseman. In 34 postseason games, he batted .266 (34-for-128) with 16 runs, 7 doubles, 8 home runs, 24 RBI and 19 walks.

===Legacy===

Hall of Fame pitcher Mariano Rivera, when asked whether there was anyone he was afraid to face, said that he was never afraid, but &quot;I will put it like this: The only guy that I didn&#x27;t want to face, when a tough situation comes, was Edgar Martínez. The reason is because I couldn&#x27;t get him out. (laughs) I couldn&#x27;t get him out. It didn&#x27;t matter how I threw the ball. I couldn&#x27;t get him out. Oh, my God, he had more than my number. He had my breakfast, lunch and dinner. He got everything from me.&quot; Versus Rivera, Martínez was able to log a .579 batting average, with 11 hits during 19 at bats. Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martínez (no relation) also named Edgar Martínez as one of the toughest hitters he had to pitch against in his career because, Pedro said, he was very disciplined at the plate and &quot;would foul off pitches that would wipe out anybody else.&quot;

Martínez was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on September 9, 2003, in a pregame on field ceremony at Safeco Field. In October 2004, following his retirement, a section of South Atlantic Street (State Route 519) in Seattle adjacent to Safeco Field was renamed Edgar Martínez Drive South. At his retirement ceremony, a portrait &quot;featuring his high stepping batting style&quot; painted by artist Michele Rushworth was presented to him by the Mariners. In 2004, MLB renamed the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award in Martínez&#x27;s honor. In 2005, fans voted Martínez as the third baseman on the Latino Legends Team. Since his retirement, the Mariners did not issue Martinez&#x27; uniform number 11 to any other player. Under Mariners&#x27; team policy, he was not eligible to have his uniform number formally retired until 2010, when he became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame for the first time. The Mariners inducted Martínez into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame on June 2, 2007, and retired Martinez&#x27;s #11 jersey on August 12, 2017.
First eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in the 2010 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, and with 75% of the vote required for induction, Martínez received 36.2% of the vote. While some sports writers felt that his batting numbers do not overcome the one-dimensional aspect of his career as a DH, others have compared this to the specialty of closers whose contribution to their teams victories resides on working one inning to preserve an advantage and the fact that these late inning relievers are not involved in other facets of the game such as hitting and base running. By the 2018 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, his ninth year on the ballot, Martínez&#x27;s vote total increased to 70.4%. The 2019 ballot, his last chance for election by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, elected him to the Hall of Fame, appearing on 85.4% of the ballots cast. He became the second player to enter the Hall of Fame as a Mariner, after Ken Griffey Jr., and the sixth player to be elected in his final year of eligibility, after Red Ruffing, Joe Medwick, Ralph Kiner, Jim Rice, and Tim Raines. He entered the Hall with the aforementioned Rivera, who was elected in his 1st year of eligibility, along with the late Roy Halladay (1st ballot, posthumous). A statue of Martínez was installed outside Seattle&#x27;s T-Mobile Park in 2021.

The , named after Martínez, was built in barrio Higuillar in Dorado. Sustaining structural damages as a result of Hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017, a $700,000 restoration of the sports complex was completed in 2021. The complex hosts school sports competitions and has a baseball field, a track field, a basketball court and a gym.

==Coaching career==
On June 20, 2015, the Mariners hired Martínez as their hitting coach, reassigning Howard Johnson. The team&#x27;s offense improved from a .233 batting average and 3.4 runs scored per game in the 68 games coached by Johnson to a .260 average and 4.6 runs per game with Martínez in 94 games. Though Jerry Dipoto, newly hired as general manager, fired Lloyd McClendon as manager after the season, he retained Martínez. Martínez coached the Mariners through to the end of the 2018 season. Out of a desire to spend more time with his family, Martínez moved from hitting coach to a hitting advisor role with the Mariners organization after the 2018 season.

Following the firing of Jarret DeHart on August 22, 2024, the Mariners announced that Martínez would be serving as the team&#x27;s hitting coach for the remainder of the season. On November 25, Martínez would be replaced by Kevin Seitzer as the hitting coach but will remain with the Mariners in overseeing the club&#x27;s hitting program.

==Personal life==

Martínez met Holli (née) Beeler on a blind date; they married in October 1992. They live in Kirkland, Washington, with their three children: Alex, Tessa, and Jacqueline. Martínez is one of the founders of Plaza Bank, founded in 2005 as Washington&#x27;s first 

Martínez and his wife Holli have contributed their time and money to Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital, including the Edgar Martínez Endowment for Muscular Dystrophy Research, established by the Mariners in honor of his retirement, and the Children&#x27;s Hospital Annual Wishing Well Night at T-Mobile Park. Martínez has also supported the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Overlake Hospital, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Wishing Star Foundation, United Way, Esperanza, Page Ahead Children&#x27;s Literacy Program, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, and Mariners Care. Because of his contributions, on June 20, 2007, Martínez was inducted into the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame in Boise, Idaho. In 2006, Martínez co-founded Branded Solutions, a corporate merchandise category, with two executives from ImageSource. He sold the company to ImageSource in 2010. For the 2013 season, the Mariners worked with Martínez, local chef Ethan Stowell and bartender Anu Apte to create &quot;Edgar&#x27;s Cantina&quot; at T-Mobile Park.

<text>Below is a list of lieutenant governors of the U.S. state of California, 1849 to present. In California, the Lieutenant Governor and the Governor do not run together on the same ticket. The Lieutenant Governor can therefore be affiliated with a different political party than that of the Governor. Per the 1879 California Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor is the President of the State Senate.

<doc id="572961" wikidata="Q1052530" url="?curid=572961" title="Cedar River (Iowa River tributary)">
<text>The Cedar River is a river in Minnesota and Iowa. It is a tributary of the Iowa River, which flows to the Mississippi River. The Cedar River takes its name from the red cedar (&quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;) trees growing there, and was originally called the Red Cedar River by the Meskwaki. The first Mississippi steamboat reached Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 1844, and during the next decade, the Red Cedar (as it was still called) was an important commercial waterway. The surrounding region is known officially as the Cedar River Valley, though it is more commonly referred to simply as the Cedar Valley. The stream is young geologically, and only in places where the glacial material has been removed is the underlying bedrock exposed.

==Geography==
The headwaters of the Cedar River are located in Dodge County, Minnesota, consisting of a west fork and middle fork approximately three miles northeast of the town of Blooming Prairie, and an east fork approximately one mile south of the town of Hayfield. It then flows into Mower County, Minnesota through the townships of Udolpho, Lansing, Austin (where Turtle Creek and Dobbins Creek join it), and Lyle. It then flows into Mitchell County, Iowa and Floyd County, Iowa with the endpoint being located in Louisa County, Iowa at the town of Columbus Junction, where it joins with the Iowa River which then winds its way to the Mississippi River. Despite being a tributary of the Iowa River, it appears larger than the Iowa River at their confluence point. Palisades-Kepler State Park is located on the Cedar River near Cedar Rapids.

At Conesville, Iowa, the Cedar River is approximately 5,798 cubic feet per second.

Cedar County, Iowa is named for the river.

Major cities (with populations greater than 20,000) located along the Cedar River include Austin, Minnesota, Cedar Falls, Iowa, Waterloo, Iowa, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

==Flooding==

===1993===

In 1993, the river flooded some areas of downtown Cedar Rapids. The river crested at 19.83 feet. This was the worst flood in Iowa&#x27;s recorded history, before the Cedar River flooded again in 2008.

===2008===

In 2008, flooding of the river caused the evacuation of around 20,000 of Cedar Rapids&#x27; residents and flooded over 1,200 blocks of the city. Upriver, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls metropolitan area was less affected, thanks mainly to the large dikes that protect the downtowns of both cities. To the north, the flooding Cedar River collapsed Charles City&#x27;s landmark suspension bridge, as well as destroying many homes and community parks.

<doc id="572962" wikidata="Q1775326" url="?curid=572962" title="6th (UK) Division">
<text>The 6th (United Kingdom) Division was a division of the British Army, which had been raised and disbanded numerous times as needed over the last 200 years. It was first established by Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley in 1810, for service in the Peninsular War (part of the Coalition Wars of the Napoleonic Wars) as part of the Anglo-Portuguese Army. Over the following four years, the division took part in numerous battles and sieges. Notably, on 22 July 1812, the division was heavily engaged during the Battle of Salamanca and suffered the most casualties of any allied formation in that battle. Following the invasion of France, the formation played a prominent role in the 1814 Battle of Toulouse where it assaulted and seized numerous French redoubts protecting the city. While successful, the formation suffered heavy losses from the fighting. This battle marked the end of the Peninsular War and the War of the Sixth Coalition, and the division was broken-up. It was reformed and active for most of the following year, during the War of the Seventh Coalition; held in reserve at the beginning of the Battle of Waterloo, it was committed in the evening to bolster the centre-left of the British line and suffered heavy casualties in the process.

The division also took part in the Second Boer War and the First World War. It was active in the early stages of the Second World War, with its component brigades engaged in various parts of the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre. In the twenty-first century, the division was reformed on 1 February 2008, for Operation Herrick service in the War in Afghanistan. It was disbanded following deployment to Afghanistan as a combined joint task force, in 2011. The division was again reformed, by the renaming of Force Troops Command, in August 2019. 

It was disbanded again in 2024, with its units moved to Field Army Troops.

==Napoleonic Wars==

===Initial service in the Peninsular War===

Following the Battle of Bussaco, on 27 September 1810 during the Peninsular War, Arthur Wellesley (later, the duke of Wellington) ordered the Anglo-Portuguese Army to retreat towards the Portuguese capital of Lisbon and the nearby prepared fortifications, the Lines of Torres Vedras. There, they were met by reinforcements that had arrived from other theaters of the Napoleonic Wars (which the Peninsular War formed part of). These troops were used to bring the 5th Division up to strength, and then, on 6 October 1810, Wellesley ordered the formation of the 6th Division with the remainder. Under the command of Major-General Alexander Campbell, the division comprised one brigade of British infantry and one brigade of Portuguese troops that included the Loyal Lusitanian Legion. Minus the Portuguese, the division was 1,948 strong. After serving in the Lines of Torres Vedras, the division took up winter quarters at Alenquer.

During March 1811, the French started to withdraw from Portugal and were followed by the majority of the Anglo-Portuguese Army. After the Battle of Redinha, the division (alongside the 3rd and the Light Divisions) was used as the spearhead of the pursuit after the French. The presence of these three divisions, at the end of the month, intimidated the French into a further withdrawal from Guarda. It then moved to join the Blockade of Almeida and was present at the connected Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro. Now 5,250 strong, it was posted on the flank of the main British force with a deep ravine to its front that hindered any prospect of a French assault. While some ineffective skirmishing took place, the division suffered the loss of just four Portuguese troops. It remained in the vicinity of Almeida until its capture. By September, having moved into Spain, the Anglo-Portuguese Army fought the Battle of El Bodón on 25 September. The same day, to the north of that battleground, the 6th Division engaged in a skirmish with French forces and inflicted 11 dead and captured 37 more, for the loss of 12 of their own. Later in the month, the formation was withdrawn to Beira, Portugal, for winter.

In January 1812, the division (alongside the rest of the army) left winter quarters and marched through heavy snow back into Spain. The division acted as a covering force for the initial part of the campaign, while other parts of the army undertook engagements such as the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo. In June, the division escorted Wellington as he entered Salamanca. This was followed by an active role in the Siege of the Salamanca forts and criticism of their engineering work, due to a lack of experience in digging siege works. During the siege, the division launched an unsuccessful attack on one fort and lost 126 men, including one brigadier. Following the successful end to the siege, the Anglo-Portuguese Army prepared for an engagement with the main French force in the theater that eventually occurred at the Battle of Salamanca on 22 July. The division formed part of the army&#x27;s second line behind the 4th Division. When the latter came under heavy attack, the 6th Division moved forward to assist. They fended off French cavalry attacks, halted the main infantry assault, and forced the French to withdraw. The formation advanced after the French but ran into reformed troops, and then engaged in a ferocious prolonged duel until dark descended. The division&#x27;s final assault was led by the Portuguese brigade, which was unsuccessful and lost 487 men in 15-minutes (including the wounded brigade commander). However, the overall pressure and supporting attacks by other elements of the Anglo-Portuguese Army resulted in a French retreat. The British losses within the division amounted to 1,193, with the formation&#x27;s overall losses being the highest of any of the Anglo-Portuguese in the battle. While the army then marched towards Madrid, the Spanish capital, the division moved to Cuéllar to be in a position to intercept any French forces that might have moved to interfere. The division was chosen for this task due to its losses, and to also allow for recently arrived sick troops to be assigned to a formation in a secondary area so that they could acclimatize to Spain and not hinder combat operations. The Anglo-Portuguese Army left Madrid in August and linked up with the 6th Division on 3 September. Over the course of the month, the division unsuccessfully attempted to outflank French forces to bring them to battle, before joining the Siege of Burgos. A failed assault soon followed, and the division was allocated a larger role in October although this attack did not materialize. On 21 October, the siege was abandoned, and the army withdrew. By the end of the year, the division was back in winter quarters in Portugal.

===Invasion of France===
During 1813, the division was used to guard the army&#x27;s lines of communication and was based around Medina de Pomar for a time. In June, the formation arrived in the vicinity of Vitoria (but did not take part in the battle) and then took part in the sieges of Pamplona and the siege of San Sebastián (retreating towards Pamplona following the unsuccessful siege of the latter). This was followed by the Battle of Sorauren (part of the larger Battle of the Pyrenees) in July, where it suffered 820 casualties over the two days it was engaged in combat. The division then moved to Navarre, where it and several other formations aimed to deter a French attack while the main body undertook the second siege of San Sebastián. It then took part in the October Battle of the Bidassoa and skirmished with French troops. Success here resulted in the invasion of France and the division spearheaded the advance towards the bridge at Amotz during the Battle of Nivelle. The division forded the Nivelle, then climbed a steep hill to assault the entrenched French positions that protected the bridge. By the time they had made the climb, the 3rd Division had already forced their way across the bridge and the presence of the two formations prompted the French to retreat without much further fighting. During the battle, the division suffered 272 casualties, largely from exposure to artillery fire. The following month, the Nive was crossed at Ustaritz, during the Battle of the Nive. While the main body of the army moved forward to fight the Battle of St. Pierre on 13 December, the division was initially ordered to remain at Ustaritz. After a long march to catch up, it arrived in the rear of the British positions towards the end of the battle and played a minor role in the final stages of the fighting and suffered a mere 33 casualties. This marked the end of fighting for the year.

In February 1814, the army broke winter quarters and the division moved towards Hasparren to be in a position to interdict any French attempts to lift the siege of Bayonne. It then moved to Orthez, and took part in the Battle of Orthez where it suffered 89 losses. On 20 March, near Tarbes, the division outflanked French troops who were engaged by other British forces. However, Wellington ordered an end to the battle before the division could launch an assault. It then marched on Toulouse, skirmished with French forces at various locations en route, and then took part in the April Battle of Toulouse and stormed several redoubts at Mont Rave. While successful, the division suffered 1,515 casualties. This was roughly one third of the formation&#x27;s strength, which included one battalion that suffered over 50 per cent losses. Meanwhile, Napoleon, Emperor of the French, had abdicated following the capture of Paris on 31 March, which ended the War of the Sixth Coalition. With the war over, the formation was broken up along with the remainder of the army&#x27;s divisions. The troops marched to Bordeaux, from where they either returned to the UK or were transported to North America to take part in the ongoing War of 1812.

===Waterloo campaign===
At the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition, British and Hanoverian troops moved into the Southern Netherlands—previously Austrian Netherlands—as part of an Anglo-Dutch effort to secure the territory while awaiting a political outcome to the war at the Congress of Vienna. On 11 April 1815, after the outbreak of the War of the Seventh Coalition upon Napoleon&#x27;s return to power and the arrival of allied reinforcements, the force in the Southern Netherlands was reorganised into divisions of the Anglo-Allied Army. The 6th Division was reformed, under the command of Lieutenant-General Galbraith Lowry Cole, and consisted of the British Tenth Brigade and the Hanoverian Fourth Brigade. The latter, while remaining an official part of the division, was attached to the 5th Division and dispatched to take part in the Battle of Quatre Bras and stayed with them during the fighting at Waterloo. The Tenth Brigade remained at Brussels during the initial part of the Waterloo campaign and Cole went on his honeymoon. Around 16/17 June, Major-General John Lambert, commanding the Tenth Brigade and the temporary divisional commander, was ordered to move his formation up to Waterloo. While the brigade consisted of four battalions, the 81st Regiment of Foot (Loyal Lincoln Volunteers) was left behind as a reserve.

The brigade arrived just prior to the battle commencing and became the final reserve of the Anglo-Allied Army. It was initially based behind the Mont-Saint-Jean farm, which was located behind the centre of the army&#x27;s line, but moved progressively forward as reserves were committed into the battle. During the evening, the French succeeded in capturing La Haye Sainte, an occupied farm complex to the front of the Anglo-Allied centre-left, and then immediately pushed forward skirmishers to attack the British frontline. Under increasing pressure, as French line infantry arrived, additional British reserves were committed including two of the Tenth Brigade&#x27;s battalions who quickly became heavily engaged. Fearing the French could collapse this part of the line, the brigade&#x27;s final battalion, the 1st Battalion, 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot, was ordered forward. They took up a position on the Wavre–Charleroi crossroad, which bisected the Anglo-Allied Army&#x27;s position, and formed square with the intent that they could engage a French breakthrough on either of their flanks while also supporting the frontline. The 27th came under such heavy fire that they suffered 50 per cent losses within a few minutes, and by the end of the battle had suffered 68 per cent casualties (478 men). Both sides remained heavily engaged, while a key moment of the battle unfolded on the centre-right of the line: the French Imperial Guard assaulted and were repulsed. As the Guard fell back, panic spread among the French infantry, facing the Anglo-Allied centre-left who joined the retreat with the battle ending soon after. The Tenth Brigade&#x27;s three battalions had a strength of 2,198 at the start of the battle, and suffered 834 casualties including 170 killed over the course of the day. 

Following Waterloo, the entire army marched into France and arrived on the outskirts of Paris on 1 July. The war ended a short while later, following the French capitulation. Cole rejoined the division on 7 July. On 30 November, following the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the British force in France was reorganised into the Army of Occupation that consisted of four divisions and did not count the 6th among them.

==Second Boer War==
The Second Boer War broke out on 11 October 1899, after tensions arose between the British Empire, the South African Republic, and the Orange Free State. In response, the British Government mobilised the three-division strong Natal Field Force in the UK and then dispatched it to reinforce the British military presence in southern Africa. By November, it had been decided that additional troops were needed. The order to form a new 6th Division was given on 2 December 1899, although actual mobilisation did not start until two days later and was completed by the 11th. On formation, the division consisted of the 12th and the 13th Brigades, and had a strength of 8,811 men, 1,287 horses, and 26 artillery pieces. The first elements embarked ships on 16 December and started to arrive at Port Elizabeth on 12 January 1900, while the final dispatch (the division&#x27;s medical unit) did not leave the UK until 5 January and arrived in Africa on the final day of the month. The division (minus the 12th Brigade, which had been reassigned to other duties after landing) assembled at Teebus during late January, to guard the lines of communication. By 8 February (and having been reinforced with the newly formed 18th Brigade), the division had moved to the &quot;Modder River Camp&quot; (also known as the &quot;Modder Position&quot;), south of Magersfontein and the conflux of the Riet and Modder Rivers, to join the effort to lift the siege of Kimberley.

In mid-February, the 6th Division supported the Cavalry Division during its advance on Kimberley, by occupying captured terrain and keeping the supply lines secure. This included some small-scale clashes with Boer forces. Between 14–15 February, the division&#x27;s infantry covered in 24-hours to cross the Modder River at Klip Drift in support of the general advance (in total, the division had covered around in five days). This move threatened a large body of Boers who were positioned near Magersfontein, which faced the Modder Position and was now outflanked, and facilitated the Cavalry Division&#x27;s seizure of Kimberley on 15 February. That evening, the Boers (under the command of Piet Cronjé) abandoned Magersfontein and marched east across the frontline and skirted around the 6th Division&#x27;s positions and linked up with other Boer troops. Louis Creswicke, who wrote about the conflict, described the scene: &quot;One may imagine the midnight picture. The dark immensity of veldt—the dust-driven, sweltering veldt—and Cronje, miles ahead with his horde, the remnant of his convoy, his women and children, fleeing along the north bank of the Modder, harassed by the Sixth Division...&quot;. While the majority of the 18th Brigade was left to guard the ford across the Modder, one battalion was dispatched towards Magersfontein to determine if any Boers remained and to capture leftover supplies. The remainder of the division chased the Boer force and skirmished with their retreating rearguard over the course of the 16th and suffered 101 casualties in the process. The pursuit continued the following day, which included an isolated supply convoy from the 13th Brigade being overrun. As additional infantry divisions and the cavalry division joined the pursuit, the Boers ultimately entrenching themselves in a position on the Modder River and the Battle of Paardeberg followed.

By the middle of the year, conventional warfare had ended and the Boers adopted guerrilla warfare tactics. Resultingly, the field divisions were broken up by the end of the year, and the troops were dispersed to garrison towns or to create more mobile forces to counter the new Boer tactics.

==First World War==
The 6th Division was a Regular Army division that was sent to France on 9 September 1914. It served on the Western Front for the duration of the First World War, first seeing action in the First Battle of Ypres as part of III Corps.

In 1915 the division moved into the Ypres Salient to relieve troops that had fought in the Second Battle of Ypres. The Salient was relatively quiet for the rest of the year, except for an attack on the chateau at Hooge on 9 August.

At the end of July 1916 the division was withdrawn, having suffered 11,000 casualties, and in September it was attached to XIV Corps where it joined in the Battle of the Somme by attacking the German fortification known as the Quadrilateral. It captured this area on 18 September. They then participated in the attacks on Morval and Le Transloy before being withdrawn on 20 October and moved into Corps Reserve. Total casualties on the Somme were 277 officers and 6,640 other ranks. In November the division moved to the relatively quiet La Bassée sector, and in March 1917 it went to the Loos sector where it conducted operations and trench raids around Hill 70.

It was withdrawn on 25 July, shortly before the final assault on the hill. From reserve, it then went to take part in the Battle of Cambrai as part of III Corps. Four days after the battle ended, the division was withdrawn to rest at Basseux. By February 1918 the division was manning the Lagnicourt Sector and was there on 22 March when the Germans launched their Spring Offensive which drove the division back and caused 3,900 casualties out of its 5,000 infantry. On 25 March the division was withdrawn to the Ypres Salient again as part of the Second Army.

By September the division was part of IX Corps and took part in the Battle of Épehy, participating in the general attack on St Quentin and The Quadrilateral (not the same as the position of the same name attacked at the Somme (see above)) that began on 18 September and ended with the Quadrilateral&#x27;s capture on the 25th.

The division&#x27;s last two major assaults of the war were in October. On the 8th they captured Bohain and on the 18th they took the high ground overlooking the Sambre–Oise Canal that prepared the way for the Battle of the Sambre.

==Second World War==

During the Second World War the division did not fight as a complete formation. On 3 November 1939 it was formed in Egypt by the redesignation of the British 7th Infantry Division, under the command of Major-General R.N.O&#x27;Connor. On 17 June 1940 Divisional H.Q. became H.Q. Western Desert Force. The Division effectively ceased to exist. The Division reformed in Egypt on 17 February 1941, under the command of Major-General John Evetts. From 7 to 19 April it was temporarily under command of Brigadier C.E.N. Lomax.

On 18 June, when command of the allied forces fighting in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign on the southern front were reorganised, the divisional HQ was placed under Australian I Corps to command the remnants of &quot;Gentforce&quot; (5th Indian Infantry Brigade and 1st Free French Light Division). Two days later the division was joined from Egypt by 16th Infantry Brigade and on 29 June by 23rd Infantry Brigade. &quot;Gentforce&quot; force captured Damascus on 21 June. For the rest of the campaign, which ended with the Vichy French surrender on 11 July, the division was engaged with the support of Australian units in attempts to force the Damascus to Beirut road through the Anti-Lebanon Mountains the entrance to which was dominated by the high Jebel Mazar. Despite intense efforts Vichy forces maintained control of the position and the main allied effort was switched to the advance on the coast.

On 29 September 1941 Major-General Evetts left and Brigadier G.N.C. Martin took acting command. Eleven days later on 10 October that year it was redesignated the 70th Infantry Division, and Major-General Ronald Scobie assumed command.

==Operation Herrick==
On 26 July 2007 the Secretary of State for Defence announced that a new &#x27;HQ 6 Division&#x27; would reform to direct the International Security Assistance Force&#x27;s Regional Command South in Afghanistan. Des Browne said &#x27;In order to meet these temporary demands we have decided to augment the forces&#x27; command structure, and will temporarily establish an additional 2-Star deployable HQ. It will be based in York and will be known as HQ 6 Division, with a core of 55 Service personnel, drawn from existing structures. We will keep our planning assumption under review but currently we assess this HQ will be established until 2011.&#x27; Major General Jacko Page OBE took command of the new HQ with effect from 1 February 2008.

Headquarters 6th (United Kingdom) Division marked its formation with a parade and flag presentation in York on 5 August 2008. It focused on preparing brigades for Afghanistan and was based at Imphal Barracks, Fulford, York. During summer 2009, the divisional headquarters was significantly reinforced and transformed into Combined Joint Task Force 6 before deploying to Afghanistan as Regional Command South in November 2009. 
The division headquarters closed in April 2011.

<text>Office Depot, Inc. is an American office supply retailer headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. The company operates 960 retail stores in the United States under the Office Depot and OfficeMax brands, as well as e-commerce sites and a business-to-business sales organization. The company has combined annual sales of approximately $11 billion, and employs about 38,000 people in the United States.

==History==
Office Depot was founded in by F. Patrick Sher, Stephen Dougherty, and Jack Kopkin, who became the company&#x27;s chairman and chief executive officer, the president, and executive vice president respectively. All three were formerly associated with Mr. HOW Warehouse, a home improvement company that Sher sold to Service Merchandise in 1983. The first store, located at the Lakes Mall in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, opened in October 1986. The company announced its initial public offering of stock, and went public in December 1988.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
In April 1991, it merged with Office Club, which provided an expansion to the West Coast. In 1995, Office Depot entered the Mexican marketplace in a joint venture with Grupo Gigante, making it the retailer&#x27;s first international expansion. Office Depot then entered the European and Australian direct mail market, after acquiring Viking Direct in May 1998.

In 1997, Office Depot and Staples attempted a merger. On July 18, 1997, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that a federal district court in Washington, D.C. granted their request for a preliminary injunction, blocking Office Depot and Staples from merging as one company.

In December 2001, Viking Direct expanded to Central America with new retail stores in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Costa Rica through a joint licensing agreement. Office Depot sold Office Depot Europe (Viking Direct&#x27;s parent) to an investment firm in September 2017.

On February 20, 2013, it was announced that Office Depot and OfficeMax would combine in an all-stock deal, pending regulatory approval and stockholder approval. The merger was completed on November 5, 2013. In May 2014, Office Depot announced the closure of four hundred stores, due to declining sales and customer migration to e-retailers.

On February 4, 2015, it was announced that rival Staples had agreed to purchase Office Depot, in a cash and stock deal worth approximately $6.3 billion. However, the Federal Trade Commission voted to block the merger in December 2015. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted the FTC a preliminary injunction against the merger on May 10, 2016, resulting in the proposed merger&#x27;s termination.

In January 2017, Gerry Smith was named as the company&#x27;s new CEO, effective February 27. Smith was the chief operating officer at Lenovo Group.

Office Depot bought technology services firm CompuCom in 2017 to position the company to provide technology services.

In January, 2021, Office Depot acquired enterprise procurement software provider BuyerQuest.

===Environmental initiatives===
Office Depot built a LEED Gold-certified retail store in Austin, Texas, in April 2008. The Boca Raton headquarters was also awarded a LEED Gold certification in September 2010.

== Private label brands ==
The company&#x27;s portfolio of brands includes Ativa, TUL, Foray, Realspace, and DiVOGA.

==Sponsorships==
In January 2005, Office Depot became a partner of NASCAR, with the title &quot;Official Office Products Partner of NASCAR&quot;. In the same year, the company signed on as the primary sponsor of the #99 Ford Fusion, owned by Roush Fenway Racing and previously driven by Carl Edwards. They sponsored Edwards until the end of the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season.

In December 2008, Office Depot announced that it would become the co primary sponsor for Tony Stewart and the No. 14 Chevrolet at Stewart-Haas Racing in 2009. In September 2012, Office Depot announced it would not renew sponsorship with Tony Stewart or Stewart-Haas Racing.

In November 2012, Office Depot partnered with the Born This Way Foundation to sell limited edition office supplies and give 25% of earnings to the organization.

==FTC settlement==

In March 2019, Office Depot and Support.com, Inc., a California-based tech support software provider, agreed to pay a total of $35 million to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that the companies tricked customers into buying millions of dollars&#x27; worth of computer repair and technical services by deceptively claiming their software had found malware symptoms on the customers&#x27; computers.

<text>Haemotoxins, hemotoxins or hematotoxins are toxins that destroy red blood cells, disrupt blood clotting, and/or cause organ degeneration and generalized tissue damage. The term &quot;haemotoxin&quot; is to some degree a misnomer since toxins that damage the blood also damage other tissues. Injury from a haemotoxic agent is often very painful and can cause permanent damage and in severe cases death. Loss of an affected limb is possible even with prompt treatment.

Haemotoxins are frequently employed by venomous animals, including snakes (vipers and pit vipers) and spiders (brown recluse). Animal venoms contain enzymes and other proteins that are haemotoxic or neurotoxic or occasionally both (as in the Mojave rattlesnake, the Japanese mamushi, and similar species). In addition to killing the prey, part of the function of a haemotoxic venom for some animals is to aid digestion. The venom breaks down protein in the region of the bite, making prey easier to digest.

The process by which a haemotoxin causes death is much slower than that of a neurotoxin. Snakes which envenomate a prey animal may have to track the prey as it flees. Typically, a mammalian prey will stop fleeing not because of death, but due to shock caused by the venomous bite. Symptoms are dependent upon species, size, location of bite and the amount of venom injected. In humans, symptoms include nausea, disorientation, and headache; these may be delayed for several hours.

Haemotoxins are used in diagnostic studies of the coagulation system. Lupus anticoagulant is detected by changes in the dilute Russell&#x27;s viper venom time, which is a laboratory assay based on—as its name indicates—venom of the Russell&#x27;s viper.

<doc id="572995" wikidata="Q2208719" url="?curid=572995" title="Imee Marcos">
<text>Maria Imelda Josefa Remedios &quot;Imee&quot; Romualdez Marcos-Manotoc (; born November 12, 1955) is a Filipino politician and film producer serving as a senator since 2019. She previously served as governor of Ilocos Norte from 2010 to 2019 and as the representative of Ilocos Norte&#x27;s 2nd district from 1998 to 2007. She is a daughter of 10th Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos and former first lady Imelda Marcos, and the older sister of the current president, Bongbong Marcos.

Imee Marcos&#x27; political career began during her father&#x27;s martial law regime, becoming chairperson of the Kabataang Barangay (KB) Foundation in 1977 and a member of the Batasang Pambansa in 1984. It was during her KB term that activist Archimedes Trajano was abducted, tortured, and murdered in 1977 shortly after publicly questioning her appointment to the office. With her interest in media, she produced various film projects such as Nonoy Marcelo-directed propaganda films: the 1977 short documentary &quot;Da Real Makoy&quot; and the 1978 television film &quot;Tadhana&quot;, the first Philippine animated feature film; she helped establish the Metro Manila Popular Music Festival in 1978, and was made director general of the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines in 1982. After her family was ousted from power in the People Power Revolution of 1986, she and her husband Tommy Manotoc were exiled in Morocco.

After the death of Ferdinand Marcos in 1989, President Corazon Aquino allowed the Marcoses to return to the Philippines in 1991. Imee ran for political office in 1998, and won three terms in the House of Representatives and three terms as governor of Ilocos Norte. She was elected to the Senate in the 2019 elections.

Imee Marcos&#x27;s conviction in the 1993 &quot;Trajano v. Marcos&quot; case (978 F 2d 493) before the U.S. district court in Honolulu is noted in U.S. legal circles for exposing the weaknesses of the act of state doctrine, allowing for similar suits to be filed.

She has been linked to the stolen wealth of her family, identified as a beneficiary of various Marcos offshore holdings as revealed in the Panama Papers and the findings in the court convictions of her mother Imelda Marcos. These holdings were defined as &quot;ill-gotten wealth&quot; by the Supreme Court of the Philippines, and are the subject of repatriation efforts by the Presidential Commission on Good Government. Amidst the growing rift between the Marcos and Duterte families during her brother Bongbong&#x27;s administration, she has frequently sided with the Dutertes and their allies.

==Early life==
Imee Marcos was born on the morning of November 12, 1955 at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Mandaluyong (then a municipality in Rizal) to Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos. She has three other siblings: Ferdinand &quot;Bongbong&quot; Marcos Jr., the current president; Irene Marcos-Araneta; and Aimee Marcos, who was adopted.

She turned ten years old the day afterwards her father was elected in 1965. In an interview with her family-backed &quot;Filipinas Magazine&quot; in 1999, she admitted that she was uncomfortable living in the palace because it was too confining, very formal, and fixed. She also added that it is &quot;not necessarily the most appropriate place to bring up a kid but it was quite nice&quot;.

While residing at the palace, Marcos asserted that she attended &#x27;regular&#x27; schools in Manila. However, she had to discontinue her education due to the challenges faced by the First Family in going out caused by protest rallies outside Malacañang. These rallies, met with military assaults resulting in numerous Filipino deaths, were a response to her family&#x27;s enduring conjugal dictatorship that spanned over two decades.

==Education==
During the 2019 elections, Marcos&#x27;s educational background has been steeped in controversy. Under her parents&#x27; conjugal dictatorship, Marcos graduated from at least four schools (including three universities), she graduated as &quot;Cum Laude&quot; and &quot;class valedictorian&quot; in two public occasions.

===Primary and secondary education===
* Marcos attended the &quot;Institucion Teresiana&quot; (now Saint Pedro Poveda College) in Quezon City from Kindergarten through Grade 4 where she earned first honors.
* She transferred to the Convent of Our Lady of Assumption at Herran Street in Manila for Grade 5 to first year high school, where she also earned first honors.
* Marcos later transferred to the &quot;American School&quot; (now International School Manila) in Makati.

====Falsification of Santa Catalina high school graduation====
Marcos claimed that she graduated as class valedictorian from Santa Catalina Convent (now called Santa Catalina School) in Monterey, California.

On 21 March 2019, the assistant head of the Santa Catalina school, John Aimé, stated the following: &quot;&#x27;(Imee Marcos) attended our school for a brief period in the fall of 1972 — she is &quot;not&quot; a graduate&quot;.

=== Undergraduate education ===
In 1973, Imee Marcos enrolled at Princeton University, where she took a variety of courses in religion and politics though she did not declare an academic major.

Marcos&#x27;s stay at Princeton was marred with controversy with black and Asian students (Asian-American Students Association - AASA) protesting her admission for allowing the daughter of a dictator to study at the university and as a potential threat to students who opposed the Marcos regime.

* She withdrew from Princeton in 1976, returned in 1977, and then withdrew for the last time in 1979. She did not receive any degree from Princeton University.
* According to a Princeton alumnus Richard Klein in the August 1983 issue of &quot;Town Topics&quot;, Marcos had flunked out.

In the book &quot;Some Are Smarter Than Others&quot;, author Ricardo Manapat reveals that after the EDSA revolution, investigators from the Presidential Commission on Good Government found out that Marcos&#x27;s tuition, monthly allowance, and the 18th-century estate she stayed in while studying at Princeton was paid for using taxpayer money that could be traced partly to the intelligence funds of the Office of the President, and partly to some of the 15 bank accounts that the Marcoses had secretly opened in the US under assumed names.

==== Falsified claims of graduation from Princeton University ====
Imee Marcos&#x27;s time as a student at Princeton became a public issue once again in 2018, when she filed her candidacy for the Philippine Senate in the 2019 elections.

Marcos claimed in numerous venues, including a campaign leaflet and her official website, that she had graduated from Princeton. This resulted in social media uproar which brought up old news articles to show that Imee Marcos had not.

On her campaign website, Marcos uploaded an official biography that claimed that she was &quot;one of the first female graduates from an Ivy League School—Princeton University, graduating with honors,&quot; but this claim was quickly disproved by news reports and on social media. In addition, she had stated in her curriculum vitae during her stay in the House of Representatives that she had graduated with honors from Princeton with an &quot;Independent Major in Religion and Politics&quot;.

In a later interview with news anchor Tina Marasigan on DZMM TeleRadyo, she was asked whether she really graduated from Princeton or not, and whether her status as a Princeton graduate could be proven. She evaded the question and answered:

The ABS-CBN News network noted that the video went viral as Marcos opted not to answer the question.
 This was seconded by InterAksyon, pointing out that Marcos &quot;avoided answering the question and instead diverted the topic to the scholastic records of her brother Bongbong Marcos.&quot;

* In January 2019, the deputy spokesperson of Princeton university, Michael Hotchkiss, stated that their university records &quot;do not show that Ms Marcos was awarded a degree.&quot;
* On 26 February 2019, the student newspaper of Princeton, &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;, reported that Marcos falsely claims that she graduated from the university. In an e-mail message to &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;, Hotchkiss repeated the statement: &quot;Our records do not show that Ms. Marcos was awarded a degree.&quot;

=== Time at the University of the Philippines, College of Law ===
After her stay at Princeton, she then enrolled at the University of the Philippines College of Law. Accordingly, her admission was controversial because the student body protested the fact that she had failed to meet the normal requirement of having a college degree, while they had to go through a stringent admissions process.

* According to University of the Philippines Cebu, Professor Madrileña de la Cerna, Marcos did not take 35 units worth of courses at the College of Law by the time she was supposed to graduate. Despite the missing units, the college faced political pressure to allow her to graduate, but the faculty, led by Ms. Haydee Yorac, refused to approve her graduation.

==== Staged ceremony, mock graduation and honorary claims ====
A few days after the University of the Philippines held its recognition ceremonies for 1983, a televised recognition ceremony held at the Meralco Theater showed Imee Marcos graduating, and being honored &quot;magna cum laude&quot; even though she had not actually graduated. The ceremony was pushed by her parents, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, who ruled the Philippines under their conjugal dictatorship.

In the book &quot;Some Are Smarter Than Others&quot; published in 1991 and written by Ricardo Manapat, the author detailed, &quot;It appeared that Imee never had the proper qualification to enter the school and that her name never appeared in the list of approved graduates nor among the candidates endorsed for graduation by a committee.&quot;

Marcos claimed in her curriculum vitae during her time at the House of Representatives that she graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the UP College of Law. She also claimed that she graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

* The Executive Vice President of University of the Philippines, Teodoro Herbosa, declared: &quot;There is no record of her graduation from UP nor any honors or academic distinctions received with the University Registrar&#x27;s office&quot;.

A viral Facebook post later circulated in the social platform, claiming that Imee graduated from the University of the Philippines in 1983 as class valedictorian. The post included an alleged yearbook, which had Marcos in it. The yearbook&#x27;s authenticity was later proven to be false, as Marcos did not appear in any authenticated UP yearbook from 1983. Coincidentally, Marcos&#x27;s eldest son Borgy was also born in 1983, making it impossible for Marcos to graduate from UP Law on time.

According to former UP Law dean Froilan Bacungan in the book &quot;The Turning Point: Twenty-six accounts of February events in the Philippines&quot;:

=== Falsification of Master in Management degree ===
The Asian Institute of Management refused to provide any public information on whether Marcos was enrolled or had graduated from their school, as Marcos has claimed through her government resume that she also earned a &quot;MA Management and Business Administration (MA MBA)&quot; from the school.

* On 22 March 2019, the Registrar and Student Enterprise Director of the school, Bryan Magbutay, officially declared the following: &quot;In our fifty years of providing world class programs, we &quot;never&quot; offered an MA—MBA&quot;.

== Career under the Marcos administration ==
=== Declaration of martial law ===
Marcos and her siblings (Ferdinand Jr. and Irene) were studying overseas before Marcos signed Proclamation No. 1081 on September 21, 1972. The siblings stayed there until they ended their studies, but would come home for Christmas and summer holidays She turned 18 - the Philippines&#x27; age of majority, fourteen months after the declaration of Martial Law, and played various political roles in the Martial Law administration - as chairperson of the Kabataang Barangay and as assemblyman to the Batasang Pambansa. She was already 30 when the People Power revolution finally deposed the Marcos administration in 1986.

=== Administrative and political roles ===
==== Kabataang Barangay Foundation ====
After returning from Princeton, Marcos entered the world of politics as chairperson of the Kabataang Barangay Foundation in September 1977. On the same day she became chairperson, student Archimedes Trajano of Mapúa Institute of Technology was found brutally murdered after questioning her appointment at his school&#x27;s open forum the day prior. She would later be convicted on the torture and killing of Trajano in later life.

==== Assemblyman for Ilocos Norte to the Batasang Pambansa ====
On June 30, 1984, she won a seat as one of two assemblyman to the Batasang Pambansa for Ilocos Norte (the other assemblyman was Antonio V. Raquiza) under the wing of her father&#x27;s dictatorship. She formally held this role until the Batasang Pambansa was dissolved in the aftermath of the 1986 EDSA Revolution, which ousted their family from power.

====National Media Production Center and Experimental Cinema of the Philippines====
From 1979 to 1986, she was consultant to the minister of the National Media Production Center in Quezon City. From 1982 to 1985, she was director general of the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP) after recommendation from her parents, who were controlling the country through a conjugal dictatorship. She served as co-producer of the films &quot;The Boatman&quot;, &quot;Brutal&quot;, and &quot;Scorpio Nights&quot;, but was not listed as producer or co-producer of other ECP films.

In a 2002 interview with Philippine cinema academician Joel David, Marcos confirmed that she had &quot;half-jokingly&quot; named the “&quot;Experimental Cinema of the Philippines&quot;” as a reference to Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, the institution founded during the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini - a reference to a cinema institution put up under a prior dictatorship which Professor David surmised to also be a tease aimed at Imee&#x27;s parents.

As the mid-1980s approached, the collapse of the Philippine economy forced government to reduce the budget of the ECP, and to raise funds, it began screening what critics deemed skin flicks, which were called &quot;Bomba&quot; or &quot;Bold&quot; films in the local slang. At around this time, Imee Marcos promoted Johnny Litton, who had been deputy director general to chief executive officer of the ECP under her, and Litton&#x27;s decision to screen extremely explicit films such as Scorpio Nights (Regal Films), Company Of Women (Athena Productions, Inc.) and Hubo (lit. &quot;Naked&quot; FLT Films International) were scored by industry critics. By 1985 ECP was producing &quot;about twenty sexually explicit quickies&quot; which they hoped to screen at the three screening rooms of the National Film Center. The films were assured of a neat profit despite the few screening venues.

==== Unexplained Marcos wealth ====
The Marcoses got much criticism during the last part of Ferdinand Marcos&#x27;s reign because of their conspicuous spending, which was far beyond their legal means, as expressed in the Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos&#x27;s legally-required Statements of Assets Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN).

Some of the specific things Imee Marcos enjoyed were her own &quot;Marcos Mansions&quot; in Baguio and in the Metro Manila area, and her own purchases of Marcos jewels just like her mother.

In one instance recounted by British journalist Caroline Kennedy, Imee Marcos effectively used Philippine Airlines flights as a courier for breastmilk when she was traveling in Europe but had left her child in the Philippines. According to Kennedy, Imee had explained that she &quot;expressed her milk every day and then Daddy sent a Philippine Airlines plane to wherever she was and it would bring the milk back.&quot; Kennedy noted that this coincided with a time when many Europe-based Philippine expats complained of a lot of flight delays and cancellations.

All this was aside from the uber-VIP treatment that the Marcoses regularly received. For example, when Imee Marcos enrolled in the University of the Philippines, the university broke its own policy of not having airconditioned classrooms and made sure the lecture halls Imee had classes in were equipped with AC.

=== Other roles before the 1986 revolution ===
==== Other media work ====
From 1975 to 1986, Marcos produced the television shows &quot;Kulit Bulilit&quot; and &quot;Kaluskos Musmos&quot;. She was also a consultant/writer of the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop for Asia and New York (1977–1979). She also collaborated as a producer with cartoonists José Zabala-Santos and his nephew Nonoy Marcelo to work for the first-ever Philippine full-length animated film titled &quot;Tadhana&quot; (&quot;Destiny&quot;), which originally conceived as a television pilot, premiered on Philippine television during the anniversary of Martial law in 1978.

Marcos was once a columnist of &quot;Manila Bulletin&quot; (then known as &quot;Bulletin Today&quot;) in Manila, publisher of the Filipino Film Review, publisher and editor of the Kabataang Barangay Foundation, Makati, Metro Manila, and special consultant to the chairperson of the board of BBC-2, RPN 9, and IBC 13. She was also the producer of &quot;Metro&quot; Magazine (1975–1986).

==Torture and murder of Archimedes Trajano==

The torture and killing of Archimedes Trajano was attributed to Imee Marcos, then the National Chairman of the Kabataang Barangay. &quot;On August 31, 1977, Archimedes Trajano, a 21-year-old student of Mapua Institute of Technology, attended an open forum with Imee Marcos, 21-year-old daughter of the dictator. Her father had appointed her National Chairman of the Kabataang Barangay youth organization. When Trajano questioned her about her appointment, Imee apparently became irritated. Her guards seized Trajano and dragged him away. His body was found hours later: he had been severely tortured and beaten to death.&quot;

Nine years after the killing of Archimedes Trajano, his mother, Agapita Trajano, pressed charges against Imee Marcos and her accomplices for &quot;false imprisonment, kidnapping, wrongful death, and a deprivation of rights&quot; of her son. Marcos and her lawyers did not deny that Trajano was tortured—instead, they argued that as agents of the state, the soldiers who killed Trajano were immune from suit in a foreign state. The Honolulu district court awarded $2.5 million in punitive damages, $1.25 million for mental anguish to Agapita Trajano and $246,966 in attorney&#x27;s fees and costs against Imee Marcos for the murder of Archimedes Trajano, by Marcos&#x27;s personal bodyguards. Imee Marcos responded by saying, &quot;Yes, Archimedes Trajano was tortured and killed but it&#x27;s none of your business.&quot;&quot;

== 1986 ouster and life in exile ==
Increasing unrest springing from the economic collapse of the Philippines in the years after the assassination of Senator Benigno Aquino in 1983 came to a head in February 1986, when the EDSA Revolution succeeded in unseating the Marcoses from Malacañang palace.

Fearful of a scenario in which Marcos&#x27;s presence in the Philippines would lead to a civil war, the Reagan administration flew Marcos and a party of about 80 individuals - the extended Marcos family and a number of close associates - from the Philippines to Hawaii despite Marcos&#x27;s objections. Imee and her family were on the flight with her parents.

The exiles stayed at Hickam Air Force Base at the expense of the US Government. A month later, they moved into a pair of residences in Makiki Heights, Honolulu, which were registered to Antonio Floirendo and Bienvenido and Gliceria Tantoco.

Marcos would eventually die in exile in 1989.

President Corazon Aquino eventually allowed the Marcoses, including Imee, to return to the Philippines in order to face various charges. News reports from the period record that Marcos supporters organized a crowd from Manila&#x27;s slums to welcome the Marcoses on their return.

== Post-exile career ==
=== Return to politics ===

Twelve years after her family&#x27;s exile, Marcos returned to politics. She ran as Congresswoman of the 2nd District of Ilocos Norte and won. She assumed office on June 30, 1998. She was then reelected in 2001 and 2004. Her term ended on June 30, 2007.

In the 2010 elections, she ran as governor of Ilocos Norte against her cousin, Michael Marcos Keon, who was the governor during that time. She defeated her cousin in the elections. Imee had 196,160 votes while Keon had 86,005 votes. She assumed office on June 30, 2010. She was re-elected in 2013, unopposed. She was reelected in the 2016 elections, securing a third consecutive and final term.

During the third Sulong Pilipinas Convention in 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte named Imee as one of his campaign contributors, saying that she borrowed money to fund his campaign. However, Duterte&#x27;s Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE) does not include her as a donor. Imee denied the claim saying that she just helped him get votes from the Ilocos Region.

On January 25, 2019, Marcos tweeted that Ilocos Norte&#x27;s poverty incidence rate lessened under her governorship; however, the very same tweet showed poverty incidence rate actually increased during her rule. Poverty &quot;reduction&quot; rate was 17% in 2006, while it dropped to 5% in 2015. The tweet was afterwards deleted.

=== Establishment of the Marcos political dynasty ===

Imee Marcos&#x27;s entrance into politics, beginning with her term as congresswoman of the 2nd District of Ilocos Norte in 1998, saw her taking over the position previously held by her brother, Bongbong Marcos, who became governor of Ilocos Norte that same year. In the context of their mother Imelda Marcos&#x27;s similar return to politics as congresswoman in Leyte in 1995, journalists and academics noted that the Marcoses had cemented a political dynasty after their return from exile, despite the explicit anti-dynasty provision in Article II Section 26 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines.

Saying that this was a common occurrence because of the way Philippine society is structured, Imee Marcos asserted in a November 2012 interview with the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; that: 

Political scientist Ramon Casiple, in an interview with the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, noted:

=== Renegade and establishment of CREAM ===
Marcos has been president and executive producer of Renegade Filmmakers since 1996.

In 2007, along with some industry luminaries, Imee Marcos established the Creative Media and Film Society of the Philippines (CREAM). A year after CREAM evolved into CREAM Content Distribution, Inc., a production company that specializes in animation, game and film production. She is currently the president of CREAM.

===Unexplained wealth===
Imee Marcos was named in the Offshore Leaks – Panama Papers, along with her three sons, Fernando Martin, Matthew Joseph, Ferdinand Richard Michael, her sister Irene Marcos, her brother-in-law Gregorio Maria Araneta III, and her estranged husband Tommy Manotoc&#x27;s relatives Ricardo Gabriel Kalaw Manotoc and Teodoro Kalaw Manotoc. According to records uncovered by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Imee and her three sons are beneficiaries of the Sintra Trust, which was formed in June 2002 in the British Virgin Islands. Other documents, the latest dated 2010, also name Imee as a financial adviser for the Sintra Trust as well as ComCentre Corporation, which was formed in January 2002 and is still in operation. She is also identified as a &quot;master client&quot; for the M Trust, which was formed in July 1997 and closed July 2009. However, these three offshore accounts do not appear in Imee&#x27;s Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net worth (SALN). The SALN is required of all public officials and employees, and should include all of the officials&#x27; assets and liabilities.

=== Misuse of tobacco funds ===

On March 2, 2017, House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas, along with Pampanga representatives Aurelio Gonzales Jr. and Juan Pablo Bondoc, filed House Resolution 882, which requested the House Committee on Good Government to &quot;conduct an inquiry&quot; about the misuse of PHP66.45 million from Ilocos Norte&#x27;s share of excise tax funds to obtain more than 110 units of motor vehicles. The resolution cited that the &quot;highly irregular purchase&quot; violated 2 republic acts—RA No. 7171, &quot;An Act to Promote the Development of the Farmer in the Virginia Tobacco Producing Provinces,&quot; and RA No. 9184, &quot;Government Procurement Reform Act --and 1 presidential decree: PD No. 1445, Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. The investigation began on May 2, 2017.

The vehicles were said to be for distribution to the different barangays and municipalities. Marcos justified the purchase as a response to the multiple requests of farmers asking for vehicles, although Fariñas had pointed out that RA 7171 does not include purchasing vehicles as a means to utilize the excise tax. He also pointed out that a barangay captain from Laoag City received vehicles, despite the fact that there are no tobacco farms in that area. Other barangay captains have also complained that the vehicles were not duly registered under the Land Transportation Office (LTO), or filed as government property, so costs for oil and gas could not be reimbursed by the barangay budget.

At a July 24, 2017 hearing, six local officials confessed that they have access to tobacco excise tax funds used to pay 70 mini-trucks. Pedro Agcaoili, Eden Batulayan, Josephine Calajete, Encarnacion Gaor, Genedine Jambaro, and Evangeline Tabulog also acknowledged that their signatures were written on pertinent documents, a fact that they had previously denied. Marcos also admitted that the said mini-trucks were bought from a direct contractor, and was not up for public bidding, as was the protocol when government property is procured.

Upon continued investigation and hearings, the House committee discovered that all the purchased vehicles &quot;were overpriced by PHP21,450,000.&quot; The direct contractor who sold 40 units of mini cab was identified as Mark Chua, who is also currently Marcos&#x27;s long-time boyfriend, who overpriced the mini cabs by PHP7,800,000 overall. The committee also verified the complaints from barangay captains that the vehicles did not have registrations from the LTO. Committee Report No. 638 therefore concluded and recommended that charges be filed against Marcos, Chua, and several local officials. As of July 2018, another &quot;fact-finding investigation&quot; initiated by the Office of the Ombudsman is underway. If they find enough cause, the Ombudsman will then open a formal investigation.

=== As beneficiaries of illegal Swiss foundations ===
In the conviction of her mother Imelda Marcos for seven counts of graft in November 2018, the Sandiganbayan anti-graft court found that illegal Swiss foundations were used to earn from investments and interests to benefit Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos and their beneficiaries Imee Marcos, Bongbong Marcos, and Irene Marcos-Araneta.

The Sandiganbayan&#x27;s 5th Division convicted former Imelda Marcos for creating and maintaining seven private foundations in Switzerland while holding government positions from 1968 to 1986. Imee and her siblings were named as beneficiaries of two of the illegal foundations: the Trinidad Foundation and the Xandy Foundation.

=== Senator (2019-present) ===


Marcos filed her certificate of candidacy on October 16, 2018, accidentally arriving at the same time as human rights advocate Chel Diokno, who was also filing his candidacy. Because Chel Diokno&#x27;s crowds supported his human rights advocacy, political chants quickly transitioned into protest chants concerning the Marcos martial law legacy, including the traditional protest chants &quot;Never Again to Martial Law&quot; and &quot;Marcos Hitler Diktador Tuta!&quot; (Marcos: Hitler, Dictator, Lapdog&quot;). Imee Marcos did not acknowledge either Chel Diokno or the protest chants of his supporters.

On November 10, 2018, the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan found that she and her siblings benefited from the illegal Swiss foundations that her mother, Imelda Marcos, created and maintained. On November 25, 2018, Marcos proposed to expand the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) by providing a monthly income to fishermen and farmers. Marcos also proposed a rescue package to support coconut farmers.

Despite the senatorial campaign not yet in effect, Marcos began a premature senatorial campaign in numerous provinces. On January 17, 2019, Cebu City mayor Tomas Osmeña ordered the taking down of political tarpaulins of Marcos during the Sinulog Festival; the mayor criticized Marcos for &#x27;politicizing&#x27; a religious festivity.

In her campaigns, she noted that she was a graduate of Princeton University in the United States. However, Princeton deputy university spokesperson Michael Hotchkiss stated that Imee&#x27;s claim was false and completely fabricated, as she never graduated from Princeton University. At the same time, Imee&#x27;s claim that she was a cum laude from the University of the Philippines Diliman was found to be fabricated. UP Executive Vice President Teodoro Herbosa noted that &quot;there is no record of Imee&#x27;s graduation from UPD (University of the Philippines Diliman) &quot;nor&quot; any honors or academic distinctions received with the University Registrar&#x27;s office.&quot; During a February 9, 2019, senatorial debate, Marcos called on the government to remove term limits in elections, sparking criticism. Term limit removal was used by her father, the late former President Ferdinand Marcos, in the 1970s which led to a 21-year brutal regime. On March 6, 2019, amid Imee&#x27;s fake degrees controversy, President Duterte&#x27;s daughter, Sara Duterte, backed Marcos, stating, &quot;Honesty should not be an election issue,&quot; effectively yielding to Imee&#x27;s fabricated claims. Marcos has also claimed she graduated from Santa Catalina School as &quot;class valedictorian&quot; for more than four decades. On March 21, 2019, Santa Catalina School assistant head of school John Aimé disproved Imee&#x27;s claims, stating: &#x27;Imee Marcos attended our school for a brief period in the fall of 1972, she is &quot;not&quot; a graduate.&#x27; After Imee&#x27;s third educational attainment claim was disproved, the Asian Institute of Management (AIM)&#x27;s Registrar and Student Enterprise Director, Bryan Magbutay, reiterated, &quot;In our 50 years of providing world class programs we &quot;never&quot; offered an MA MBA,” effectively disproving Imee&#x27;s fourth educational attainment claim.

In another campaign meet-up, Marcos stated that she was &quot;too young&quot; to have any power during her father&#x27;s dictatorship, and that she should not be blamed for the things she did due to her youth. However, records show that she was already 30 years old when her family was ousted from power in 1986.

On January 25, 2019, Marcos tweeted that Ilocos Norte&#x27;s poverty incidence rate lessened under her governorship; however, the very same tweet showed poverty incidence rate actually increased during her rule. Poverty &quot;reduction&quot; rate was 17% in 2006, while it dropped to 5% in 2015. The tweet was afterwards deleted. In April 2019, Marcos stated that she intends to make working abroad a &quot;matter of choice&quot;, however, she dodged questions on her father&#x27;s dictatorship - which led to the country&#x27;s economic collapse, forcing Filipinos to work abroad in the first place.

On April 11, 2019, after China again reiterated its claims in the South China Sea, Marcos announced that she &quot;trusts China&quot;, falsely claiming that China never invaded any Philippine territory. She also blamed the Philippines, falsely claiming that Filipinos started the territorial conflicts with China, earning criticism from Filipinos.
After the 2019 Philippine Senate election, she placed eighth and won one of the twelve contested seats. On June 30, 2019, Marcos officially took office in the Senate and filed various bills during her first months including her own version of the SOGIE bill or the Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity or Expression Bill that was first filed by fellow Senator Risa Hontiveros.

====18th Congress====
On July 22, 2019, Marcos was appointed as chair of the Philippine Senate Cultural Communities Committee.

On August 6, 2019, Marcos filed a bill that would make men also liable for committing adultery. Following the controversial transfer of 42 billion by the Department of Health to the Department of Budget and Management-Procurement Service (DBM-PS) for the purchase of COVID-19 pandemic personal protective equipment, in September 2021, Marcos filed a bill seeking to abolish the DBM-PS and the Philippine International Trading Corporation to &quot;address systemic corruption&quot; in the DBM-PS. In September 2021, the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) Law was signed into law by President Duterte. Senator Imee Marcos voted in favor of the law, which regulated and legalized POGOs, which are gambling corporations. The illegal activities of the POGOs were known since 2016, and were widely exposed to the public even before the law that legalized them was enacted.

====19th Congress====
In the 19th Congress, Marcos was named as chair of four Senate committees: Cooperatives; Electoral Reforms and People&#x27;s Participation; Foreign Relations; and Social Justice, Welfare and Rural Development. In December 2022, Marcos filed &quot;fruit salad&quot; bills promoting and protecting the Philippine&#x27;s pineapple, moringa, dragon fruit, and mango industries.

In June 2023, Marcos filed a Senate resolution seeking to investigate a &quot;request&quot; by the United States government for the Philippines to temporarily house Afghan refugees. Marcos maintained the request lacked transparency and said some refugees, who are &quot;supporters of the US and possibly, even former employees of the US government or US companies&quot;, pose a threat to public safety and national security.

In November 2023, Marcos reaffirms her support and loyalty to former president Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Sara Duterte regarding the issue of confidential funds, while stating that the Philippines does not need to cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) as it will &quot;cause great shame for the Filipinos&quot; citing the courts are working, free and strong.

== Party affiliation ==
Marcos formerly belonged to the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL), the political party of her father. In 2009, she and her family joined the alliance of the Nacionalista Party in support of its 2010 presidential candidate, then-Senator Manny Villar. Incidentally, her father used to be a member of Nacionalista before he founded KBL in 1978.

== Martial law denialism ==

As with other Marcos family members who have stayed in the public eye since their return to the Philippines, Imee Marcos has received significant criticism for instances of historical revisionism, and the denial or trivializing of the human rights violations and economic plunder that took place during the Marcos administration, and of the role she played in the administration.

Prominent examples of statements by Imee Marcos which have received such criticism include her 2016 statement that she was &quot;too young&quot; to have any power during her father&#x27;s administration (although she was already 30 years old when her father was ousted in February 1986), and her 2018 assertion that critics should just &quot;move on&quot; regarding the crimes and excesses of the martial law era.

=== &quot;Move on&quot; remark regarding martial law abuses ===
On August 21, 2018, the anniversary of the assassination of Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. who had flown back to the Philippines to face her father, Imee Marcos told Filipinos to &quot;move on&quot; from the abuses, murders and massacres during her father&#x27;s dictatorship. Imee Marcos stated, ”The millennials have moved on, and I think people at my age should also move on as well&quot;.

To this, various sectors of the youth protested, releasing statements such as &quot;She has no right to claim what our stand is on the issue. Not in our name, Imee Marcos,&quot; &quot;The millennials, the youth in general, have not moved on and we will never move on from the Marcoses’ crimes against the Filipino people. Not until justice has been served to the thousands of Filipinos who were killed, abducted and tortured under their reign, we will not move on&quot;, &quot;Binubuo pa lang ako ng magulang ko may utang na ako. Paano ako nagmo-move on Imee Marcos?&quot; (I was still being formed by my parents in the womb, already I had debts. How can I move on, Imee Marcos?), &quot;When your family&#x27;s in jail, when you return what you stole, when Marcos is taken out of Libingan ng mga Bayani, then we move on,&quot; and &quot;The gall of Imee Marcos to ask why many have not “moved on” from the turbulent past they caused is like asking someone who got robbed to just think of the stolen item as donation. Isauli niyo mga ninakaw ninyo! (Return what you stole!)&quot;

In a statement before media, Marcos said &quot;...what I&#x27;ve heard is that there are calls for an apology tantamount on admission, which we would never do&quot; and stated that she did not know what her family should admit to in the first place.

=== Family denial ===
Imee Marcos denies that human rights abuses occurred during her family&#x27;s regime and called them political accusations.

In a press briefing, she said &quot;&quot;Kung ang dinedemand ay admission (of guilt) ay palagay ko hindi pwede &#x27;yun&quot; (If what is demanded is an admission of guilt, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible).

When asked why, she replied: &quot;Bakit kami mag-aadmit sa hindi namin ginawa?&quot;&quot; (Why would we admit to something we did not do?)

She then falsely claimed: &quot;As we all know, these are political accusations that have not been proven in court.&quot; She was convicted before a U.S. district court through the 1993 &quot;Trajano v. Marcos&quot; case (978 F 2d 493).

==Personal life==
Marcos is the eldest daughter of Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Romuáldez Marcos. Her full siblings are Bongbong Marcos, Irene Marcos, and Aimee Marcos. She also has a number of half-siblings who are not as known by the public at large. This includes three siblings which her father had with Carmen Ortega of the Ortega clan of La Union, who was his common-law wife before he married Imelda Romuáldez as a political strategy.

Marcos was married to golfer and former professional basketball coach Tommy Manotoc. Their marriage was controversial since the Philippines did not have a divorce law and Manotoc&#x27;s October 1981 divorce obtained in the Dominican Republic from wife Aurora Pijuan was not recognized under Philippine law. Marcos and Manotoc have three sons: Fernando Martín (&quot;Borgy&quot;), a commercial model and club DJ; Ferdinand Richard Michael (&quot;Mike&quot;), a lawyer; and Matthew Joseph (&quot;MJ&quot;), a sports agent and incumbent governor of Ilocos Norte since June 30, 2019. She had two stepchildren during her marriage to Manotoc, including ABS-CBN reporter and news anchor TJ Manotoc.

On October 19, 2000, a 27-year-old film producer from Leyte, Leyte named Cesar Bendigo who was allegedly in a romantic relationship with Marcos was killed in an ambush by New People&#x27;s Army rebels; Marcos last visited his residence on August 24, 2000.

Since her legal separation from Manotoc, Marcos has been in a long-term relationship with Singaporean and ethnic Chinese businessman and resident Mark Chua, since the 1990s. Marcos and Chua have been linked to the Ilocos Norte Tobacco Excise Tax Funds Scandal.

<text>In computer science, a generator is a routine that can be used to control the iteration behaviour of a loop. All generators are also iterators. A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array, in that a generator has parameters, can be called, and generates a sequence of values. However, instead of building an array containing all the values and returning them all at once, a generator &quot;yields&quot; the values one at a time, which requires less memory and allows the caller to get started processing the first few values immediately. In short, a generator &quot;looks like&quot; a function but &quot;behaves like&quot; an iterator.

Generators can be implemented in terms of more expressive control flow constructs, such as coroutines or first-class continuations. Generators, also known as semicoroutines, are a special case of (and weaker than) coroutines, in that they always yield control back to the caller (when passing a value back), rather than specifying a coroutine to jump to; see comparison of coroutines with generators.

==Uses==

Generators are usually invoked inside loops. The first time that a generator invocation is reached in a loop, an iterator object is created that encapsulates the state of the generator routine at its beginning, with arguments bound to the corresponding parameters. The generator&#x27;s body is then executed in the context of that iterator until a special &quot;yield&quot; action is encountered; at that time, the value provided with the &quot;yield&quot; action is used as the value of the invocation expression. The next time the same generator invocation is reached in a subsequent iteration, the execution of the generator&#x27;s body is resumed after the &quot;yield&quot; action, until yet another &quot;yield&quot; action is encountered. In addition to the &quot;yield&quot; action, execution of the generator body can also be terminated by a &quot;finish&quot; action, at which time the innermost loop enclosing the generator invocation is terminated. In more complicated situations, a generator may be used manually outside of a loop to create an iterator, which can then be used in various ways.

Because generators compute their yielded values only on demand, they are useful for representing streams, such as sequences that would be expensive or impossible to compute at once. These include e.g. infinite sequences and live data streams.

When eager evaluation is desirable (primarily when the sequence is finite, as otherwise evaluation will never terminate), one can either convert to a list, or use a parallel construction that creates a list instead of a generator. For example, in Python a generator codice_1 can be evaluated to a list codice_2 via codice_3, while in F# the sequence expression codice_4 evaluates lazily (a generator or sequence) but codice_5 evaluates eagerly (a list).

In the presence of generators, loop constructs of a language – such as for and while – can be reduced into a single loop ... end loop construct; all the usual loop constructs can then be comfortably simulated by using suitable generators in the right way. For example, a ranged loop like codice_6 can be implemented as iteration through a generator, as in Python&#x27;s codice_7. Further, codice_8 can be implemented as sending &quot;finish&quot; to the generator and then using codice_9 in the loop.

==Timeline==

Generators first appeared in CLU (1975), were a prominent feature in the string manipulation language Icon (1977) and are now available in Python (2001), C#, Ruby, PHP, ECMAScript (as of ES6/ES2015), and other languages. In CLU and C#, generators are called &quot;iterators&quot;, and in Ruby, &quot;enumerators&quot;.

===Lisp===

The final Common Lisp standard does not natively provide generators, yet various library implementations exist, such as SERIES documented in CLtL2 or pygen.

===CLU===

A yield statement is used to implement iterators over user-defined data abstractions.
string_chars = iter (s: string) yields (char);
 index: int := 1;
 limit: int := string$size (s);
 while index &lt;= limit do
 yield (string$fetch(s, index));
 index := index + 1;
 end;
end string_chars;

for c: char in string_chars(s) do
end;
===Icon===

Every expression (including loops) is a generator. The language has many generators built-in and even implements some of the logic semantics using the generator mechanism (logical disjunction or &quot;OR&quot; is done this way).

Printing squares from 0 to 20 can be achieved using a co-routine by writing:

 local squares, j
 squares := create (seq(0) ^ 2)
 every j := |@squares do
 if j &lt;= 20 then
 write(j)
 else
 break
However, most of the time custom generators are implemented with the &quot;suspend&quot; keyword which functions exactly like the &quot;yield&quot; keyword in CLU.

===C===

C does not have generator functions as a language construct, but, as they are a subset of coroutines, it is simple to implement them using any framework that implements stackful coroutines, such as libdill. On POSIX platforms, when the cost of context switching per iteration is not a concern, or full parallelism rather than merely concurrency is desired, a very simple generator function framework can be implemented using pthreads and pipes.

===C++===

It is possible to introduce generators into C++ using pre-processor macros. The resulting code might have aspects that are very different from native C++, but the generator syntax can be very uncluttered. The set of pre-processor macros defined in this source allow generators defined with the syntax as in the following example:
$generator(descent)
 int i;

 // place the constructor of our generator, e.g. 
 // descent(int minv, int maxv) {...}
 // from $emit to $stop is a body of our generator:
 $emit(int) // will emit int values. Start of body of the generator.
 for (i = 10; i &gt; 0; --i)
 $yield(i); // similar to yield in Python,
 // returns next number in [1..10], reversed.
 $stop; // stop, end of sequence. End of body of the generator.


This can then be iterated using:
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
 descent gen;
 for (int n; gen(n);) // &quot;get next&quot; generator invocation
 printf(&quot;next number is %d\n&quot;, n);
 return 0;


Moreover, C++11 allows foreach loops to be applied to any class that provides the codice_10 and codice_11 functions. It&#x27;s then possible to write generator-like classes by defining both the iterable methods (codice_10 and codice_11) and the iterator methods (codice_14, codice_15 and codice_16) in the same class. For example, it is possible to write the following program:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
 for (int i: range(10))
 std::cout « i « std::endl;
 return 0;


A basic range implementation would look like that:
class range
private:
 int last;
 int iter;

public:
 range(int end):
 last(end),
 iter(0)

 // Iterable functions
 const range&amp; begin() const { return *this; }
 const range&amp; end() const { return *this; }

 // Iterator functions
 bool operator!=(const range&amp;) const { return iter &lt; last; }
 void operator++() { ++iter; }
 int operator*() const { return iter; }


===Perl===

Perl does not natively provide generators, but support is provided by the Coro::Generator module which uses the Coro co-routine framework. Example usage:
use strict;
use warnings;
# Enable generator { BLOCK } and yield
use Coro::Generator;
# Array reference to iterate over
my $chars = [&#x27;A&#x27;...&#x27;Z&#x27;];

# New generator which can be called like a coderef.
my $letters = generator {
 my $i = 0;
 for my $letter (@$chars) {
 # get next letter from $chars
 yield $letter;
};

# Call the generator 15 times.
print $letters-&gt;(), &quot;\n&quot; for (0..15);

===Raku===

Example parallel to Icon uses Raku (formerly/aka Perl 6) Range class as one of several ways to achieve generators with the language.

Printing squares from 0 to 20 can be achieved by writing:

for (0 .. *).map(* ** 2) -&gt; $i {
 last if $i &gt; 20;
 say $i


However, most of the time custom generators are implemented with &quot;gather&quot; and &quot;take&quot; keywords in a lazy context.

===Tcl===

In Tcl 8.6, the generator mechanism is founded on named coroutines.
proc generator {body} {
 coroutine gen[incr ::disambiguator] apply $body

# Use a simple &#x27;for&#x27; loop to do the actual generation
set count [generator {
 for {set i 10} {$i &lt;= 20} {incr i} {
 yield $i
}]

# Pull values from the generator until it is exhausted
while 1 {
 puts [$count]


===Haskell===

In Haskell, with its lazy evaluation model, every datum created with a non-strict data constructor is generated on demand. For example,

countFrom :: Integer -&gt; [Integer]
countFrom n = n : countFrom (n + 1)

from10to20 :: [Integer]
from10to20 = takeWhile (&lt;= 20) $ countFrom 10

primes :: [Integer]
primes = 2 : 3 : nextPrime 5
 where
 nextPrime n
 | notDivisible n = n : nextPrime (n + 2)
 | otherwise = nextPrime (n + 2)
 notDivisible n =
 all ((/= 0) . (rem n)) $ takeWhile ((&lt;= n) . (^ 2)) $ tail primes

where codice_17 is a non-strict list constructor, &quot;cons&quot;, and codice_18 is just a &quot;called-with&quot; operator, used for parenthesization. This uses the standard adaptor function,

takeWhile p [] = []
takeWhile p (x:xs) | p x = x : takeWhile p xs
 | otherwise = []

which walks down the list and stops on the first element that doesn&#x27;t satisfy the predicate. If the list has been walked before until that point, it is just a strict data structure, but if any part hadn&#x27;t been walked through before, it will be generated on demand. List comprehensions can be freely used:

squaresUnder20 = takeWhile (&lt;= 20) [x * x | x &lt;- countFrom 10]
squaresForNumbersUnder20 = [x * x | x &lt;- takeWhile (&lt;= 20) $ countFrom 10]
===Racket===
Racket provides several related facilities for generators. First, its for-loop forms work with &quot;sequences&quot;, which are a kind of a producer:

(for ([i (in-range 10 20)])
 (printf &quot;i = ~s\n&quot; i))

and these sequences are also first-class values:

(define 10-to-20 (in-range 10 20))
(for ([i 10-to-20])
 (printf &quot;i = ~s\n&quot; i))

Some sequences are implemented imperatively (with private state variables) and some are implemented as (possibly infinite) lazy lists. Also, new struct definitions can have a property that specifies how they can be used as sequences.

But more directly, Racket comes with a generator library for a more traditional generator specification. For example,

#lang racket
(require racket/generator)
(define (ints-from from)
 (generator ()
 (for ([i (in-naturals from)]) ; infinite sequence of integers from 0
 (yield i))))
(define g (ints-from 10))
(list (g) (g) (g)) ; -&gt; &#x27;(10 11 12)

Note that the Racket core implements powerful continuation features, providing general (re-entrant) continuations that are composable, and also delimited continuations. Using this, the generator library is implemented in Racket.

===PHP===

The community of PHP implemented generators in PHP 5.5. Details can be found in the original Request for Comments: Generators.

Infinite Fibonacci sequence:

function fibonacci(): Generator
 $last = 0;
 $current = 1;
 yield 1;
 while (true) {
 $current = $last + $current;
 $last = $current - $last;
 yield $current;
}

foreach (fibonacci() as $number) {
 echo $number, &quot;\n&quot;;


Fibonacci sequence with limit:

function fibonacci(int $limit): Generator 
 yield $a = $b = $i = 1;
 while (++$i &lt; $limit) {
 yield $a = ($b = $a + $b) - $a;
}

foreach (fibonacci(10) as $number) {
 echo &quot;$number\n&quot;;


Any function which contains a yield statement is automatically a generator function.

===Ruby===
Ruby supports generators (starting from version 1.9) in the form of the built-in Enumerator class.
# Generator from an Enumerator object
chars = Enumerator.new([&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;Z&#x27;])

4.times { puts chars.next }

# Generator from a block
count = Enumerator.new do |yielder|
 i = 0
 loop { yielder.yield i += 1 }
end

100.times { puts count.next }
===Java===
Java has had a standard interface for implementing iterators since its early days, and since Java 5, the &quot;foreach&quot; construction makes it easy to loop over objects that provide the codice_19 interface. (The Java collections framework and other collections frameworks, typically provide iterators for all collections.)

record Pair(int a, int b) {};

Iterable&lt;Integer&gt; myIterable = Stream.iterate(new Pair(1, 1), p -&gt; new Pair(p.b, p.a + p.b))
 .limit(10)
 .map(p -&gt; p.a)::iterator;

myIterable.forEach(System.out::println);

Or get an Iterator from the Java 8 super-interface BaseStream of Stream interface.
record Pair(int a, int b) {};

// Save the iterator of a stream that generates fib sequence
Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; myGenerator = Stream
 // Generates Fib sequence
 .iterate(new Pair(1, 1), p -&gt; new Pair(p.b, p.a + p.b))
 .map(p -&gt; p.a).iterator();

// Print the first 5 elements
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
 System.out.println(myGenerator.next());

System.out.println(&quot;done with first iteration&quot;);

// Print the next 5 elements
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
 System.out.println(myGenerator.next());


Output:

1
1
2
3
5
done with first iteration
8
13
21
34
55
===C#===
An example C# 2.0 generator (the codice_20 is available since C# version 2.0):
Both of these examples utilize generics, but this is not required. yield keyword also helps in implementing custom stateful iterations over a collection as discussed in this discussion.
// Method that takes an iterable input (possibly an array)
// and returns all even numbers.
public static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; GetEven(IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; numbers)
 foreach (int number in numbers)
 if ((number % 2) == 0)
 yield return number;
 }


It is possible to use multiple codice_21 statements and they are applied in sequence on each iteration:

public class CityCollection : IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;
 public IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; GetEnumerator()
 yield return &quot;New York&quot;;
 yield return &quot;Paris&quot;;
 yield return &quot;London&quot;;
}
===XL===
In XL, iterators are the basis of &#x27;for&#x27; loops:
import IO = XL.UI.CONSOLE

iterator IntegerIterator (var out Counter : integer; Low, High : integer) written Counter in Low..High is
 Counter := Low
 while Counter &lt;= High loop
 yield
 Counter += 1

// Note that I needs not be declared, because declared &#x27;var out&#x27; in the iterator
// An implicit declaration of I as an integer is therefore made here
for I in 1..5 loop
 IO.WriteLn &quot;I=&quot;, I
===F#===

F# provides generators via &quot;sequence expressions,&quot; since version 1.9.1. These can define a sequence (lazily evaluated, sequential access) via codice_4, a list (eagerly evaluated, sequential access) via codice_5 or an array (eagerly evaluated, indexed access) via codice_24 that contain code that generates values. For example,

seq { for b in 0 .. 25 do
 if b &lt; 15 then
 yield b * b }

forms a sequence of squares of numbers from 0 to 14 by filtering out numbers from the range of numbers from 0 to 25.

===Python===

Generators were added to Python in version 2.2 in 2001. An example generator:
from typing import Iterator

def countfrom(n: int) -&gt; Iterator[int]:
 while True:
 yield n
 n += 1

# Example use: printing out the integers from 10 to 20.
# Note that this iteration terminates normally, despite
# countfrom() being written as an infinite loop.

for i in countfrom(10):
 if i &lt;= 20:
 print(i)
 else:
 break

# Another generator, which produces prime numbers indefinitely as needed.
import itertools

def primes() -&gt; Iterator[int]:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Generate prime numbers indefinitely as needed.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 yield 2
 n = 3
 p = [2]
 while True:
 # If dividing n by all the numbers in p, up to and including sqrt(n),
 # produces a non-zero remainder then n is prime.
 if all(n % f &gt; 0 for f in itertools.takewhile(lambda f: f * f &lt;= n, p)):
 yield n
 p.append(n)
 n += 2
In Python, a generator can be thought of as an iterator that contains a frozen stack frame. Whenever codice_25 is called on the iterator, Python resumes the frozen frame, which executes normally until the next codice_20 statement is reached. The generator&#x27;s frame is then frozen again, and the yielded value is returned to the caller.

PEP 380 (implemented in Python 3.3) adds the codice_27 expression, allowing a generator to delegate part of its operations to another generator or iterable.

====Generator expressions====

Python has a syntax modeled on that of list comprehensions, called a generator expression that aids in the creation of generators.
The following extends the first example above by using a generator expression to compute squares from the codice_28 generator function:

squares = (n * n for n in countfrom(2))

for j in squares:
 if j &lt;= 20:
 print(j)
 else:
 break
===ECMAScript===

ECMAScript 6 (a.k.a. Harmony) introduced generator functions.

An infinite Fibonacci sequence can be written using a function generator:
function* fibonacci(limit) {
 let [prev, curr] = [0, 1];
 while (!limit || curr &lt;= limit) {
 yield curr;
 [prev, curr] = [curr, prev + curr];
}

// bounded by upper limit 10
for (const n of fibonacci(10)) {
 console.log(n);

// generator without an upper bound limit
for (const n of fibonacci()) {
 console.log(n);
 if (n &gt; 10000) break;

// manually iterating
let fibGen = fibonacci();
console.log(fibGen.next().value); // 1
console.log(fibGen.next().value); // 1
console.log(fibGen.next().value); // 2
console.log(fibGen.next().value); // 3
console.log(fibGen.next().value); // 5
console.log(fibGen.next().value); // 8

// picks up from where you stopped
for (const n of fibGen) {
 console.log(n);
 if (n &gt; 10000) break;


===R===

The iterators package can be used for this purpose.
library(iterators)

# Example ------------------
abc &lt;- iter(c(&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;,&#x27;c&#x27;))
nextElem(abc)
===Smalltalk===

Example in Pharo Smalltalk:

The Golden ratio generator below returns to each invocation &#x27;goldenRatio next&#x27; a better approximation to the Golden Ratio. 
goldenRatio := Generator on: [ :g | | x y z r | 
 x := 0.
 y := 1.
 z := x + y.
 r := (z / y) asFloat.
 x := y.
 y := z.
 g yield: r
 ] repeat 

goldenRatio next.
The expression below returns the next 10 approximations.
Character cr join: ((1 to: 10) collect: [ :dummy | ratio next ]).
See more in A hidden gem in Pharo: Generator.

<doc id="572999" wikidata="Q2783877" url="?curid=572999" title="Wood (wuxing)">
<text>In Chinese philosophy, wood (), sometimes translated as Tree, is the growing of the matter, or the matter&#x27;s growing expanding stage. Wood is the first phase of Wu Xing when observing or discussing movement or growth. Wood is the lesser yang character (yin within yang) of the Five elements, fuelling Fire. It stands for springtime, the east, the planet Jupiter, the color green, windy weather, and the Azure Dragon (Qing Long) in Four Symbols.
Blue and cyan-type colors also represent wood.

==Attributes==
In Chinese Taoist and Traditional Chinese medicine thought, &quot;Wood&quot; attributes are considered to be strength and flexibility, as with bamboo. It is also associated with qualities of warmth, generosity, cooperation, and idealism. The Wood person will be expansive, outgoing and socially conscious and courageous but when feeling confined, held back, or misunderstood by others can become easily frustrated and angry. The wood element is one that seeks ways to grow and expand. Wood heralds the beginning of life, dawn, springtime and buds, sensuality and fecundity. Wood needs moisture from Water it preceding phase element to thrive.

In Chinese medicine, wood is associated with negative feelings of anger, hopelessness and positive feelings of optimism, courage, patience and the Virtue of benevolence (Ren 仁). The soul associated with wood is the Hun (魂). 

Organs associated with this element are the Zung organ the liver (yin), and the Fu organ the gall bladder (yang), the taste sour, the rancid smell also the eyes and tendons.

==Astrology==
In Chinese astrology, wood is included in the 10 heavenly stems (the five elements in their yin and yang forms), which combine with the 12 earthly branches (or Chinese signs of the zodiac), to form a 60 year cycle.
* Yang wood year (e.g. 1974).
* Yin wood year(e.g. 1975).

Wood governs the Chinese zodiac signs Tiger and Rabbit.

==Cycle of Wu Xing==
In the regenerative cycle of the Wu Xing, water engenders Wood, &quot;as rain or dew makes plant life flourish&quot;; Wood begets fire as &quot;fire is generated by rubbing together two pieces of wood&quot; and it must be fueled by burning wood.
Since wood also represents wind, it also nourishes fire with the flow of oxygen.

In the conquest cycle:

Wood overcomes earth by binding it together with the roots of trees and drawing sustenance from the soil; 

Metal overcomes Wood, as the metal axe can topple the largest trees.
In the less figurative sense, the dryness and coldness of Metal causes wood, like the trees to loose their leaves by the sap going inwards and returning to the roots in Autumn or in the fall.

<text>The 7th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army, first established by The Duke of Wellington as part of the Anglo-Portuguese Army for service in the Peninsular War, and was active also during the First World War from 1914 to 1919, and briefly in the Second World War in 1939.

==Peninsular War==
During the French Revolutionary Wars and early in the Napoleonic Wars, the largest permanent organised structure within the British Army was the brigade. The brigade, which consisted of two or more battalions grouped together under the command of a major-general, suited the small size of the army and the operations that it conducted. When needed, larger forces were organised on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis. This included multiple brigades grouped into &#x27;lines&#x27; or &#x27;columns&#x27;. As the army and its operations grew, it implemented divisions—a single formation of two or more brigades, usually commanded by a lieutenant-general. The division concept was not new and had been used by other European armies towards the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). On 18 June 1809, Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley, commander of British forces in Spain and Portugal during the Peninsular War, reorganised his force into four divisions. The following year, with the further expansion of his force, Wellington created the 7th Division. It consisted of British, German, Portuguese, and French troops. Due to the mixture of nationalities as well as line and light regiments, the division had a multitude of uniforms. This coined the nickname of &quot;The Mongrels&quot;.

The division was present at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro the Battle of Vitoria the Battle of the Pyrenees the Battle of Nivelle the Battle of the Nive and the Battle of Orthez.

==Second Boer War==
The 7th Division was re-activated during the Second Boer War. The division took part in the Battle of Poplar Grove (March 1900) and the following occupation of Bloemfontein, then took part in Lord Roberts′ march to Pretoria.

==First World War==

The 7th Division was a Regular Army formation that was formed in September 1914 by combining units returning from garrison outposts in the British Empire at the outbreak of the First World War the previous month. During the war, the division fought in the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, the Battle of Aubers Ridge, the Battle of Festubert, the Battle of Loos, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Passchendaele, and the Battle of Vittorio Veneto.

The division landed at Zeebrugge in Belgium on 6 October 1914 in an attempt to support the Belgian Army&#x27;s defence of Antwerp, but was soon forced to retreat south-west as that city fell a few days later. It then played a crucial part in the stabilisation of the front during the First Battle of Ypres, preventing a German breakthrough, although at a high cost in terms of casualties. A floating division, the 7th was the first British Division to enter Ypres on 14 October. It was ordered to hold the line, while Field Marshal French brought up his remaining six divisions and redeployed them from the Aisne to the sea. The division held an 8 mile front for two weeks, opposite some 340,000 Germans. Some 18,000 soldiers strong on 15 October, the 7th left the line on 31 October, with just 2,000 troops remaining, mostly transport and supply.

The 7th Division fought in most of the major battles on the Western Front through to 1917 before being sent to the Italian Front for the remainder of the war. At the battle of Loos in late 1915, the division&#x27;s General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major-General Thompson Capper, was killed in action at the height of the fighting. Unlike the first six regular divisions of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), a third of whose strength was made up of regular reservists, the 7th Division was originally composed entirely of serving regular soldiers, which gave rise to the division&#x27;s nickname, &#x27;The Immortal Seventh&#x27;.

==Arab Revolt==
In 1936, the Arab Revolt broke out in the British Mandate of Palestine. British troops were dispatched, ending the first phase of the war by the close of the year. Fighting soon resumed and reached its zenith during the summer of 1938. With rising tensions in Europe, the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement—on 30 September 1938—calmed the rising tensions in Europe and averted war, allowing the British to resume their military build-up in Palestine.

The 7th Division was reformed the following month, and placed under the command of Major-General Richard O&#x27;Connor. The division was deployed to Palestine on internal security duties as part of a build-up of 18,500 men in the region. This force then began to suppress the revolt. Meanwhile, Palestinian guerrillas had overrun the Old City of Jerusalem. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s men proceeded to sweep the area, declaring the Old City free of militants on 19 October. The same day, the division seized Acre and by the end of the month were clearing Jaffa of rebels. Many Palestinians were detained and rebel activity significantly dropped off in the area. In the north, the 8th Infantry Division, under Major-General Bernard Montgomery, and Special Night Squads engaged in counter-terror operations, with O&#x27;Connor writing that one brigadier &quot;always encouraged his men to be brutal&quot;. General Officer Commanding (GOC) British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan Robert Haining wrote in late 1938 that &quot;unnecessary violence, vindictiveness ..., [and] killing in cold blood&quot; had to be curbed. O&#x27;Connor was likewise opposed to the measures in the north, and wrote &quot;harshness and unnecessary violence on the part of our soldiers&quot; had to be curbed. During the operation in Jerusalem, only four to nineteen guerrillas were killed. In early 1939, the revolt finally came to an end.

==Second World War==
On 31 August, just prior to the war beginning, the headquarters of the 7th Infantry Division relinquished command of all its troops. O&#x27;Connor and the divisional staff then left Jerusalem bound for Cairo, Egypt. From Cairo, the men moved forward to Mersa Matruh arriving on 7 September. The headquarters was then assigned all troops based there, with the exception of the 7th Armoured Division. The British Official Historian, I. S. O. Playfair, comments that this decision was undertaken to relieve the burden on Lieutenant-General Henry Maitland Wilson, GOC British Troops in Egypt, of &quot;direct control of operations which had been his in addition to the command of all troops in Egypt&quot;. Due to the logistical problems in maintaining substantial forces across the Western Desert and on the Libya–Egypt border, Mersa Matruh was the forward British base of operations and supplied by rail. Positioned west of Alexandria and from the border, the location had been chosen to shield forward Royal Air Force (RAF) landing strips behind it and to defend the Nile Delta. Mersa Matruh also offered the British the strategy of drawing Italian or other forces forward to them, to allow a counter-attack after they ran into supply difficulties. On 3 November, the division was renamed the 6th Infantry Division.

<text>The Pratchett Portfolio is a small collection of the artistic works of Paul Kidby, illustrating the characters of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot;. It includes a small blurb on each character, and a picture of said person. In addition to the art, each blurb talks about how Pratchett created the characters. The portfolio was published in 1996 and followed in 2004 by &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot;.

The portfolio includes entries for characters such as Lady Ramkin, Detritus, Mustrum Ridcully, the Death of Rats, as well as Rincewind running around in the Dungeon Dimensions.

<text>Office supplies are consumables and equipment regularly used in offices by businesses and other organizations, required to sustain office operations. For example, office supplies may be used by individuals engaged in written communications, record-keeping and bookkeeping. The range of items classified as office supplies varies, and typically includes small, expendable, daily use items, and consumable products.

==Typical products==


Office supplies are typically divided by type of product and general use. Some of the many different office supply products include
*Blank sheet paper: various sizes from small notes to letter and poster-size; various thicknesses from tissue paper to 120 pound; construction paper; photocopier and inkjet printer paper;
*Preprinted forms: time cards, tax reporting forms (1099, W-2), &quot;while you were out&quot; pads, desk and wall calendars;
*Label and adhesive paper: name tags, file folder labels, post-it notes, and address labels;
*Media: ink and toner cartridges; memory cards and flash drives;
*Communication equipment: desk telephones, cell phones, and VOIP adapters; Wi-Fi adapters, ethernet cable, network routers and switches;
*Paper in roll or reel form: label tape, fax machine thermal paper, and adding machine tape;
*Educational and entertainment items: books (business, time management and self-help), tax, business application and game software, desk accessories such as a Newton&#x27;s cradle;
*Mechanical fasteners: paper clips, binder clips, staples;
*Chemical fasteners: duct tape, transparent tape, glue, mucilage;
*Comestibles: usually on-the-go snacks such as coffee, cookies, candy, chips, pretzels, trail mixes, and other snacks;
*Janitorial supplies: mops, buckets, wastebaskets, recycling bins, brooms, soap, air fresheners, disinfectants, detergents, paper towels, and toilet paper;
*Merchant supplies: price tags; time clocks; credit card processing machines and cash registers;
*Small machines: hole punches, rubber stamps, numbering machines, staplers, pencil sharpeners, and laminators;
*Containers: binders, envelopes, boxes, crates, shelves, folders, and desk organizers;
*Writing pads and books: notebooks, composition books, legal pads, and steno pads;
*Writing utensils and corrections: pens, pencils, paints, markers, correction fluid, correction tape, and erasers;
*Office food e.g. convenience food, bottled water

Common supplies and office equipment items before the advent of suitably priced word processing machines and PCs in the 1970s and 1980s were: typewriters, slide rules, calculators, adding machines, carbon- and carbonless paper.

Some vendors in the office supply industry may provide ancillary services for businesses, such as copy centers, printing and binding services. Some vendors may provide services for shipping, including packaging and bulk mailing.

==Market size==

The global office supplies market, valued at USD 151.46 billion in 2022, is projected to witness a 2.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2030. The industry&#x27;s expansion is attributed to the flourishing global services sector and increased product consumption in education. Rising environmental consciousness is driving consumers towards sustainable sourcing, production, and packaging to minimize carbon footprint. However, the COVID-19 crisis adversely affected the market, with lockdowns and social distancing measures leading to decreased demand for traditional office supplies in corporate settings worldwide.

<text>The 8th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army that was active in both the First and Second World Wars. The division was first formed in October 1914 during the First World War, initially consisting mainly of soldiers of the Regular Army and served on the Western Front throughout the war, sustaining many casualties, before disbandment in 1919. The division was reactivated in Palestine, under the command of Major-General Bernard Montgomery, in the late 1930s in the years running up to the Second World War before being disbanded in late February 1940. It was briefly reformed in Syria in an administrative role during 1942-3.

==History==

The 8th Division was a Regular Army division that was formed by combining battalions returning from outposts in the British Empire at the outbreak of the First World War. Major-General Francis Davies took command on 19 September 1914. The division moved to France in November, 1914, following the First Battle of Ypres. The division fought on the Western Front for the duration of the war, taking part in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, the Battle of Aubers Ridge, both in 1915, the Battle of the Somme, in 1916, and the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917.

===Second World War===

The 8th Infantry Division was never a full-strength formation during the Second World War. In 1939 it was based in Palestine and consisted of two infantry brigades (14th and 16th Brigades). Due to the needs of defence against German and Italian forces these units were sent to places of need and reformed as different formations. Although it had infantry it had no divisional troops due to the shortage of artillery and engineers in the Middle East. Its units were dispersed and the division was disbanded on 28 February 1940.

On 2 June 1942, the division headquarters was reformed as the 8th Division (Syria) following the redesignation of the 5th Cavalry Brigade. The division, in name only, was composed of administration units and intended to provide internal security within Syria, under the command of the Ninth Army. On 3 September the divisional headquarters role was taken by the headquarters of 89 Sub-Area, Ninth Army (Lines of Communications). In this second incarnation R.A.C. units from Ninth Army were attached. The division Headquarters were disbanded on 31 October 1943.

<doc id="573031" wikidata="Q545044" url="?curid=573031" title="Ganon">
<text>is a character and the main antagonist of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game series and franchise, as well as the final boss in many &quot;Zelda&quot; titles. In his humanoid Gerudo form, he is known as A massive and malevolent porcine creature, Ganon first appeared in the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; game in 1986, while his alter ego, Ganondorf, was introduced in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. He has since appeared in the majority of the games in the series in various forms. He is the archenemy of the protagonist Link and Princess Zelda of Hyrule and originally the leader of the Gerudo, a race of humanoid desert nomads before becoming the ruler of his demon army.

His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often involve capturing Princess Zelda and planning to conquer Hyrule and the world at large. To this end, he seeks the Triforce, an omnipotent artifact that grants any wish its bearer desires, and usually manipulates several other villains to realize his ambitions. In most games, he possesses the Triforce of Power, which gives him godlike strength, boundless mystical power, and invulnerability to all but the most powerful sacred weapons, such as the Master Sword.

As the main villain of the series, Ganon has also appeared in a variety of media, including an animated television series and manga. He appears in various spin-off games, such as &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot; and &quot;Age of Calamity&quot;, and also appears in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. The character has been well received by critics and is one of the most recognizable villains in gaming. He has been praised for providing some of the most memorable boss battles and has been named as one of the greatest video game villains of all time.

== Concept and creation ==
Ganon was conceived as the antagonist of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game by Shigeru Miyamoto working alongside Takashi Tezuka.

=== Characterisation ===
Ganon has two basic forms that appear throughout the series: one is a gigantic porcine form and the other is his humanoid Gerudo form. In the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;, &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot;, &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Echoes of Wisdom&quot; he is depicted as a blue, bipedal pig wielding either a large sword or a trident. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; marks the first appearance of his humanoid form named Ganondorf, the physically imposing and armor-clad king of the Gerudo.

For the development of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, Ganon was designed by character designer Satoru Takizawa. He imagined Ganon as a &quot;crooked and complex thief, who was basically an all-around abominable human being&quot;. However, script director Toru Osawa thought that Ganondorf should have &quot;parts where he is rather good&quot;, comparing him to the character of Raoh in &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;. With this idea in mind, Takizawa created a tentative model of Ganondorf based on actor Christopher Lambert, but the resulting designs were very different. Since Ganon had appeared earlier as a boar-like creature, Takizawa decided that Ganondorf should transform into such at the end of the game and wanted to consult Shigeru Miyamoto on this, but realised that he had no opinion on the matter. He decided on making Ganon a beast &quot;with the feeling of a pig&quot; to reference &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, the game&#x27;s director Hidemaro Fujibayashi said that he had approached Ganondorf as a main character due to his long history in the series. He added that he considered Ganondorf to be the perfect opposing character to Princess Zelda due to being a king of the Gerudo with his own motivations. Series producer Eiji Aonuma said that although Ganondorf had been portrayed throughout the series as an evil character, &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; was the first game to firmly establish him as overwhelmingly evil by including a violent scene where he kills another character.

=== Names ===
Ganon was originally known as &quot;Hakkai&quot; during development of the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, in reference to a humanoid pig character known as Zhu Bajie (&quot;Cho Hakkai&quot; in Japanese) from the 16th century Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. The character was given the name &quot;Ganondorf Dragmire&quot; in the English version of the &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; instruction manual while his monster form&#x27;s name was &quot;Mandrag Ganon&quot;. In 2017, Nintendo reconfirmed that &quot;Dragmire&quot; is the character&#x27;s surname on its official Zelda website.

Ganon was sometimes spelled inconsistently in earlier games. In the Japanese versions of the first three games, his name is anglicized as &quot;Gannon&quot;. This spelling appears in two Western releases: the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and the non-canonical &quot;Zelda&#x27;s Adventure&quot;.

=== Character design ===
Like all Gerudo, Ganondorf possesses olive dark skin, amber eyes, and red hair. Ganondorf is around and was first drawn with a &quot;sharp, birdlike nose&quot; that is characteristic of the Gerudo and &quot;strong, supple muscles&quot;. Ganondorf&#x27;s clothing in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was designed in the style of a 1980s visual kei band, with producer Toru Osawa suggesting that his design incorporate a color scheme of red, black, and gold.

In &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, Ganondorf was designed as an older version of his &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; incarnation. The artists depicted him as middle-aged and created drawings of him &quot;with an Eastern flavor&quot;. His robe was decorated with patterns that were designed to be a twist on the mark of the Gerudo seen previously. Ganondorf&#x27;s reappearance in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; returned him to a similar age to his original appearance in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. His design was created to look like a warrior, dressed in armour. He also transforms into Demonic Beast Ganon and this concept art was created with the caption &quot;Pig Ganon&quot;.

Ganon evolved into other monstrous forms for his appearance in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;. He is presented as a primal evil force that is visible as a serpentine cloud circling around Hyrule Castle. His physical form Calamity Ganon is a grotesque monster that resembles a spider equipped with various weapons. His final form is Dark Beast Ganon, a giant boar similar to previous iterations. Artist Yuki Hamada explained that his enormous size was due to the team wanting the game to end in the vast open plain of Hyrule Field. In addition, the Blight Ganons that Link encounters in the Divine Beasts were designed with similar design features, such as his red hair, as the artist Takafumi Kiuchi wanted players to feel Ganon&#x27;s presence at all times.

For the return of Ganondorf in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; the character&#x27;s design was reassigned to Takizawa. Fujibayashi said that he had given him the task of making him a &quot;very cool, very awesome demon king&quot; due to him being a crucial character within the series. He said that the designer intended to give Ganondorf an evil appearance but also wanted him to appear good so that anyone could fall in love with him. The team spent time designing his facial expressions to give him brutality but also a sense of humanity. Ganondorf&#x27;s appearance was designed with the flavour of a Japanese warlord. Every aspect of his design was carefully considered to give the impression of strength, elegance and intelligence and to portray a character with fine tastes who takes care of his appearance.

=== Portrayal ===

Ganon has been voiced by several voice actors. In the 1989 &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; animated television series and &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;, he was voiced by Len Carlson. In the &quot;Zelda&quot; series and other spin-off games, the character has been voiced by several Japanese voice actors, including Takashi Nagasako in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot;; Hironori Miyata in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;; Taiten Kusunoki in &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot;; and Kōsuke Takaguchi in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;. In the English dub of &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, he is voiced by Matthew Mercer, who unofficially portrayed the character in the live action web series &quot;There Will Be Brawl&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Ganon is the main antagonist in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. He usually appears as the final boss at the end of each game. A recurring storyline in the series centres around the protagonist Link fighting to save Princess Zelda after she is captured by Ganon. Over the course of the series, Ganon has been depicted in various physical forms. His humanoid form known as Ganondorf is the king and only male member of the Gerudo, a race predominantly consisting of female warriors. His monstrous bestial form, Ganon, resembles a giant boar. In some games, either Ganon or Ganondorf appear as the final boss, whereas in others, he transforms between the two.

Throughout the series, Ganon has been characterised as the embodiment of evil and is placed in direct opposition to the protagonist Link and Princess Zelda across multiple generations in the fictional timeline. In &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, he is implied to be the manifestation of the antagonist Demon King Demise&#x27;s hatred following the character&#x27;s defeat. The game was presented as the start of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; fictional timeline and the origin of his endless battle with Link and Zelda. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, his Dark Beast Ganon form is described as &quot;Hatred and Malice Incarnate&quot;.

The character&#x27;s motivations typically centre around destroying Hyrule or placing himself in a position of power as ruler. His destructive influence is illustrated in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, when Link awakens from a seven-year sleep to discover Hyrule transformed from a peaceful kingdom to a place of fear shrouded in darkness following Ganondorf&#x27;s rise to power. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, his destructive power is so great, that he almost wipes out the entire civilisation of Hyrule in a cataclysm known as the Great Calamity.

In the fictional lore of the series, Ganon is the bearer of the Triforce of Power, one of three components that form a core symbol of the series, a divine relic called the Triforce. The three pieces of the Triforce represent the qualities of the three characters, with Ganon being the bearer of the Triforce of Power and Link and Zelda bearing the Triforce of Courage and Wisdom respectively. A recurring plot element in the series is Ganon&#x27;s desire to obtain the completed Triforce, which offers limitless power to its bearer. This struggle for control of the Triforce has been a central aspect of several games, such as &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, and binds the three main characters in an eternal battle across the fictional &quot;Zelda&quot; timeline.

=== Powers and abilities ===
Ganon/Ganondorf is presented as a dangerous foe who is difficult to defeat. He is a formidable warrior and sorcerer, capable of dual-wielding large blades, such as great swords. He is typically only defeated by Link with the use of a legendary weapon like the Master Sword or Light Arrows. Due to his near-immortality and indestructible power, he often needs to be sealed away in another realm by magic to prevent him from causing more destruction. Like Link and Zelda, he is repeatedly reincarnated in subsequent games.

In addition to his combat skills, he also demonstrates various magical powers that originate in his use of dark magic. He can use various defensive measures in combat, such as creating magical barriers. In the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; game and &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; he is able to turn himself invisible. Ganondorf also has the ability of teleportation, giving him the advantage of sneaking behind his opponent in combat, a skill that he displays in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. In &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; he has the ability to levitate. He has also demonstrated that he can pass between dimensions, such as the Dark World and the Twilight Realm.

In several games, he is able to create a mini boss in his own likeness named Phantom Ganon. In &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, Phantom Ganon is the boss of the Forest Temple and appears as a ghostly rider that can jump in and out of paintings. In &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, he creates Puppet Ganon, a marionette that takes three forms, each requiring a different strategy to defeat. In &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, Phantom Ganon is a powerful foe that deals additional damage with an expanding pool of gloom. He also has the power to possess and control other characters. In &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; he possesses Princess Zelda and uses her body like a puppet to fight Link. He can also manipulate other characters for his own benefit, such as Zant in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, Calamity Ganon is able to corrupt creatures with the spread of a substance called Malice. He reinstates his influence over the land of Hyrule in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; by conjuring a Blood Moon, which resurrects fallen monsters.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series ===
Ganon made his first appearance in the original NES video game &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; in 1986 in the form of a blue monstrous pig. The game established the character&#x27;s desire for power, which was reiterated in subsequent games. The storyline involves the character invading Hyrule with his army and stealing the Triforce of Power. To prevent him from obtaining the Triforce of Wisdom, Princess Zelda scatters the eight pieces across the kingdom. Link is then sent on a quest to retrieve the eight fragments and finally defeats Gannon using a silver arrow. The second entry in the &quot;Zelda&quot; series, which is titled &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;, does not feature the physical presence of Ganon, but his image appears in the final game over screen, signifying his return.

He was reintroduced in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. It expands on Ganon&#x27;s backstory by revealing that he used to be a man named Ganondorf, the leader of a group of thieves, who enters the Sacred Realm and steals the Triforce, which plunges the Sacred Realm into darkness. After he is sealed in the Dark World, Link and Zelda are sent there by the wizard Agahnim, who is an avatar used to contain Ganon&#x27;s spirit. Once Link defeats Agahnim in the Dark World, Ganon rises from his body and turns into a bat. He is finally defeated by Link at the Pyramid of Power. In &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, the fourth Shadow Nightmare that Link faces in the final boss battle is based on Ganon from &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;.

&quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, which was released for the Nintendo 64, introduced the character in his humanoid form as Ganondorf, the king of the Gerudo thieves, expanding upon the backstory in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. Ganondorf schemes to take the Triforce from the Sacred Realm in order to conquer Hyrule and, after a young Link is put in a seven-year sleep, Link wakes as an adult to discover that Ganondorf is now ruling over Hyrule. After stealing the Triforce, Ganondorf&#x27;s evil heart breaks it into three pieces, with Ganondorf keeping the Triforce of Power. In the final boss fight, Link and Ganondorf battle at Ganon&#x27;s Castle, but before the fight is over, he transforms into his beast form, Ganon. He is finally defeated by Link before being sealed away in the Dark Realm.

In 2001, two games titled &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot; were released for the Game Boy Color handheld console. They feature their own antagonists, but upon completing either game, the player receives a password that provides access to a linked game in the opposite title. The linked game reveals Ganon as the secret final boss, who was resurrected by two witches named Twinrova.

Ganondorf resumes his plans to obtain the Triforce and conquer Hyrule in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;. Although he is not initially presented as the main villain, he is revealed to be the master of the Helmaroc King. He kidnaps multiple young girls with pointed ears in order to find Zelda so he can complete the Triforce and take over Hyrule, including Link&#x27;s sister Aryll. In the final boss battle, Link defeats him by thrusting the Master Sword into his forehead, turning him to stone.

In &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot;, the antagonists are initially shown to be Shadow Link and Vaati. However, Ganon is revealed to be the true villain who stole a powerful magical trident and Dark Mirror to create the evil version of Link. Ganon uses Shadow Link to kidnap the shrine maidens of Hyrule and murders the Knights of Hyrule, trapping them in the World of Darkness. Link and his clones free the shrine maidens and seal Ganon inside the Four Sword to return peace to Hyrule.

In &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, Ganondorf manipulates the sorcerer Zant to usurp the throne of the Twilight Realm. In the game&#x27;s backstory, the Sages banish Ganon with the Mirror of Twilight for trying to steal the Triforce. After Link and his companion Midna defeat Zant, they face Ganondorf for the final battle at Hyrule Castle. Ganondorf battles Link by possessing Zelda and using her like a puppet and afterwards transforms into his beast form. After Link slays Ganon, Midna safely transports Link and Zelda to Hyrule field, but Link is forced to again face Ganondorf in his humanoid form. Ganondorf is defeated with the help of Zelda&#x27;s Light Arrows when Link finally plunges the Master Sword into Ganondorf&#x27;s chest.

Ganon was replaced by two new antagonists named Ghirahim and Demon King Demise in &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;. Speaking to &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, Eiji Aonuma explained that he wanted a different kind of villain and that Ghirahim was created to contrast with Ganon&#x27;s &quot;very masculine, powerful, evil&quot; image. Despite his absence, the game suggests that Ganon is the manifestation of the game&#x27;s demonic god named Demise when Link&#x27;s companion Fi says that Demise is &quot;the source of all monsters&quot;. Demise&#x27;s final curse also establishes that Ganon, Link and Zelda are placed in an eternal cycle of conflict. Ganon appears in the final boss battle of &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;. The antagonist Yuga summons him from his seal with the power of the Seven Sages and fuses with Ganon to become a massive creature called Yuga Ganon.

In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, Ganon gives into malice and hatred to become the malevolent force called Calamity Ganon. In the backstory, he returns from an earlier defeat to take control of an army of Guardian robots, which he uses against the Hyruleans with the aim of destroying Hyrule. Using his Blight Ganon doppelgängers he murders the four Champions who pilot an ancient technology known as the Divine Beasts. He is confined in Hyrule Castle by Zelda&#x27;s powers until a hundred years later, when Link awakens to prevent his complete destruction of Hyrule.

Ganondorf returns in his humanoid form for the first time since &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;. The game&#x27;s cutscenes reveal that he is present thousands of years in the past when the first king Rauru founded Hyrule. Rauru sacrifices himself to seal Ganondorf beneath Hyrule Castle where his corpse rots for thousands of years. He is reawakened in the present when Link and Zelda investigate the depths of Hyrule Castle and, in the confrontation, his power breaks the Master Sword. In the final boss fight, which takes place deep in the chasm beneath Hyrule Castle, he regenerates into his Demon King form. After the initial fight, he uses his Secret Stone to transform into a dragon, pulling Link into the sky, and is destroyed with the help of the Light Dragon.

&quot;Echoes of Wisdom&quot;, the first mainline &quot;Zelda&quot; game to feature Zelda rather than Link as the player character, begins with a sequence in which Link saves Zelda from an Echo of Ganon but is sucked through a rift into the still world, and Ganon vanishes. An Echo of Ganon also appears as the boss of Hyrule Castle dungeon halfway through the game.

=== Other video games ===
Ganon makes an appearance in &quot;Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce&quot; for Barcode Battler II. The game was released by Epoch Co. and involves scanning barcodes to battle enemies on cards with a story based on &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. He also appears in his &quot;demon boar&quot; form in the CD-i &quot;Zelda&quot; titles: . The games center on Ganon attacking the worlds of Koridai and Gamelon. In &quot;Zelda&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, he takes over the kingdom of Tolemac and captures Link.

Ganondorf made his first appearance in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series in his &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; design as a playable character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;. He reappears in all subsequent installments, including &quot;Brawl&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot;. In &quot;Melee&quot;, Ganondorf&#x27;s moveset is a version of Captain Falcon&#x27;s and his Warlock Punch was based on the Falcon Punch. For &quot;Brawl&quot;, his design was based on his appearance in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. He also appears in the single-player &quot;The Subspace Emissary&quot; story mode. In &quot;Ultimate&quot;, his design resembles his &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; appearance. He transforms into his beast form for his final smash. As one of the bosses of &quot;Ultimate&quot;, he takes the form of Demon King Ganon, wielding two swords and combining his attacks with dark magic.

Ganondorf appears as a playable character in the &quot;Zelda&quot; spin-off title &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot;. He can also be customised with several outfits, including his Demon King costume set. Calamity Ganon appears in the next entry, &quot;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&quot;. In addition to being the main antagonist of the game, he can also be unlocked as a playable character at the end of the game after the player completes all of the challenges.

Ganon can be summoned into a player&#x27;s village in &quot;Animal Crossing: New Leaf&quot; by scanning a compatible amiibo that was released for the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. Ganondorf is available as an unlockable &quot;Mystery Mushroom&quot; costume in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;. He is also playable in the Nintendo Switch version of &quot;Diablo III: Eternal Collection&quot;, with the Switch version of the game exclusively offering amiibo support and additional content based on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. Ganon also makes a cameo appearance alongside Link in &quot;Scribblenauts Unlimited&quot;.

In the rhythm game &quot;Cadence of Hyrule&quot; Ganon is the final boss. The storyline involves Link, Zelda and Cadence searching for four magic instruments to defeat him.

=== Television series ===
Ganon appears as the main villain of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; cartoon, which was shown as part of &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot; in 1989. Ganon is a brown-skinned anthropomorphic boar and wizard with a squeally voice. He is in possession of the Triforce of Power and spends each episode plotting to steal the Triforce of Wisdom and take over Hyrule. His plan is usually thwarted by Link and Zelda by the end of the episode. He was voiced by Len Carlson.

He also appears in &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;, in which he is defeated by Link using a mirror shield.

In the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Imaginationland Episode III&quot;, Ganondorf makes an appearance in his &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; incarnation as one of many evil characters battling the good characters.

=== Comics and manga ===
Alongside Zelda and Link, Ganon appears in a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; style of manga titled &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Mirage Castle&quot;, which was published just after the first game in 1986 and includes some scrapped concepts such as Ganon&#x27;s younger brother named Demon General Gaia. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; comic series published in the 1990s by Valiant Comics was based on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; games and featured Ganon as an antagonist in the stories and bonus stories. Ganon appears in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; manga. In the &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; manga, which was originally published in two volumes and written by Akira Himekawa, the storyline provides additional details to the game&#x27;s plot in which Link defeats Ganondorf and restores peace to Hyrule.

== Merchandise ==
Ganondorf was recreated as a figure that was bundled with a limited edition of physical copies of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; HD in 2013. In September 2015, Nintendo released an amiibo of Ganondorf, which was primarily associated with &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, a compatible Ganondorf amiibo was released in November 2023. His image has also appeared on other official merchandise, including a &quot;Power&quot; t-shirt that was released for a Triforce-themed Splatfest held in &quot;Splatoon 3&quot; in May 2023.

== Reception and legacy ==
Ganon was one of the first villains in video game history and has been described by critics, including &quot;Guinness World Records 2013 Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; as one of the greatest video game villains. Aaron Greenbaum, writing for &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, remarked that throughout the series there have been confusing shifts between the characterisation of Ganon and his humanoid counterpart. He noted that in the original game and again in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, Ganon appears as a mute monster with no dialogue or personality and only exists for the purposes of the gameplay, while in other games his portrayal shifts around. This contrasts with Ganondorf&#x27;s intelligence and egomaniacal nature, which is emphasised each time the player interacts with him. Jay Castello, writing for &quot;Polygon&quot;, considered Ganondorf&#x27;s depiction as an evil character who originates from the desert to have racist undertones that have underpinned his backstory throughout the series. Ollie Reynolds of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; considered Ganondorf&#x27;s introduction in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; to be one of the best in gaming and said that, despite being on screen for just a few seconds, his entrance is so well crafted it immediately creates trepidation.

Following a demo at Space World 2000, &quot;IGN&quot; responded to Ganondorf&#x27;s character model, highlighting his battle-worn sword and noting that his face was an improvement on the N64 model and represented &quot;the pure evil within&quot;. The demo was cancelled by Nintendo and replaced by &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; demo at Space World 2001. Jose Oteru of &quot;IGN&quot; praised Ganondorf&#x27;s &quot;Wind Waker&quot; design, noting its samurai-esque and Eastern influences and describing it as a &quot;visual foil to all of the pirates and sea-driven art direction&quot;. He opined that these small design details help to give the character personality. Oli Welsh, writing for &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, said that the dialogue in the final scenes of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; expresses Ganondorf&#x27;s motivations and results in a more human villain to which players can more easily relate. &quot;GameSpot&quot;&#x27;s Rob Crossley appreciated the imaginative characterisation of Ganondorf&#x27;s sidekick Zant in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. While he thought that Nintendo was engaging in &quot;fan service&quot; when they had Ganondorf replace Zant, the final battle between Link and Ganondorf was &quot;symbolic and epic&quot;. In a review of &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, Kyle Hilliard, writing for &quot;Game Informer&quot;, considered that Calamity Ganon&#x27;s threatening presence, seen from any vantage point in the game&#x27;s world, creates a tangible goal that makes the final effort to defeat him seem like &quot;the culmination of a lifetime of preparation&quot; and makes the finale more rewarding.
Anticipation grew for the return of Ganondorf with the release of the third trailer for &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; in April 2023, due to him being absent for almost 17 years since &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. This incarnation of Ganondorf received widespread praise for his sex appeal, with Jenni Lada of &quot;Siliconera&quot; commenting that this added more mystery to the character by making him appear &quot;charismatic and charming&quot; rather than just an evil villain. Carolyn Petit of &quot;Kotaku&quot; considered Ganondorf&#x27;s characterisation in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; to be disappointing, describing him as a &quot;one-note character...without any real character or moral texture&quot;. She opined that this results in the game squandering the sense of loss that resonates at its beginning and is in contrast to his more compelling appearance in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;. Jim Norman of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; thought that Nintendo needs to do more with Ganondorf&#x27;s character depth, as his appearances throughout the series follow a common narrative structure where he is largely absent until the final battle.

The boss fights between Link and Ganon have received a mixed reception. Mark Langshaw of &quot;Digital Spy&quot; considered &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; to be one of the most memorable boss battles in gaming, commenting that the dual contest against Ganondorf and Ganon offers &quot;two epic boss battles for the price of one&quot;. Chris Freiburg for &quot;Den of Geek&quot; also chose it as the best boss fight, describing Ganon as &quot;a towering pig beast wielding two massive swords in an arena surrounded by a ring of fire&quot; and opined, &quot;it&#x27;s hard not to consider it the best boss fight in franchise history&quot;. Brian Shea, writing for &quot;Game Informer&quot;, chose the boss battle in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; as the greatest moment, stating the final blow &quot;is in stark contrast to the cute cel-shaded visual style in the best way possible&quot;, which &quot;delivers players one of the most memorable final sequences in gaming&quot;. Marco Vito Oddo of &quot;Collider&quot; also considered this as the best Ganondorf duel and compared it to the final boss battle in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, which he described as &quot;another giant blob of dark energy that fights just like every other Ganon Blight the player already fought and defeated&quot; and &quot;an unsatisfactory ending to a fantastic game&quot;. Julian Benson of &quot;TechRadar&quot; noted the extreme difficulty of the final boss fight against Demon King Ganondorf in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, but felt that the game does not prepare the player with the right skillset to successfully defeat him, resulting in him being &quot;the wrong final boss&quot; for the finale.

<text>Bodega Bay () is a shallow, rocky inlet of the Pacific Ocean on the coast of northern California in the United States. It is approximately across and is located approximately northwest of San Francisco and west of Santa Rosa. The bay straddles the boundary between Sonoma County to the north and Marin County to the south. The bay is a marine habitat used for navigation, recreation (including swimming and surfing, especially by the Dillon Beach area), and commercial and sport fishing (including shellfish harvesting).

Bodega Bay is protected on its north end from the Pacific Ocean by Bodega Head, which shelters the small Bodega Harbor and is separated from the main bay by a jetty. The San Andreas Fault runs parallel to the coastline and bisects Bodega Head, which lies on the Pacific Plate; the town is on the North American Plate. The village of Bodega Bay sits on the east side of Bodega Harbor. The bay connects on its south end to the mouth of Tomales Bay.

Streams flowing into Bodega Bay include the Estero de San Antonio and the Americano Creek.
Accessible beaches on Bodega Bay include Doran Regional Park (on the jetty) and Pinnacle Gulch.
Apart from the harbor, all of Bodega Bay lies within the boundaries of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.

==History==
Coast Miwok Native Americans lived on the shores of Bodega Bay. Documented village names include: &quot;Helapattai&quot;, &quot;Hime-takala&quot;, &quot;Ho-takala&quot;, and &quot;Tokau&quot;.
There is speculation that Bodega Bay may have been Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s Nova Albion landing location on the California coast.

Bodega Bay was first charted by Europeans in 1775 by the Spanish Peruvian explorer Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra of the Spanish Navy. The bay that was originally named for him was not present day Bodega Bay, but Tomales Bay. His ship, the &quot;Sonora&quot;, anchored in the lee of Tomales Point on October 3, 1775, departing the next day. Bodega y Quadra named Tomales Bay &quot;Puerto de la Bodega&quot;. &quot;There is no evidence in the journal or on the charts that Bodega y Quadra ever saw the entrance to [present day] Bodega Harbor or knew of the lagoon to the north&quot;. Bodega y Quadra planned to return, but was not able to. Later, as commandant of the naval base at San Blas, New Spain, Bodega y Quadra sent other expeditions to Bodega Bay with the intention of establishing a colony and mission there. It was decided, however, that the location was not ideal.

The first Russians to see Bodega Bay were the Russian-American Company (RAC) supervisors of the Aleut hunting parties aboard the American maritime fur trade sea otter hunting ship &quot;Peacock&quot; in 1807. Timofei Nikitich Tarakanov of the RAC returned to Novo Arkhangelsk, Alaska, and reported the location to Alexander Andreyevich Baranov, the chief administrator of the RAC. Baranov instructed his assistant Ivan Kuskov to survey the area for a settlement. Kuskov, the Commerce Counselor of the RAC sailing in the &quot;Kodiak&quot; (also transliterated as &quot;Kadiak&quot; and &quot;Kad&#x27;iak&quot;), entered Bodega Bay on January 8, 1809. Temporary buildings were erected to house the ship&#x27;s complement of 190 crew (130 native Alaskan males, 20 native females, and 40 Russians).

The &quot;Kodiak&quot; remained in Bodega Bay until October, 1809, returning to Alaska with more than 2,000 sea otter pelts. Kuskov returned to Novo Arkhangelsk, reporting abundant fur bearing mammals, fish, timber and tillable lands. Baranov instructed Kuskov to return and establish a permanent settlement in the area. In 1811, Kuskov returned, this time aboard the &quot;Chirikov&quot;, but found fewer otter in Bodega Bay (1,160 otter skins were taken). Three American ships were also operating in the area from a base in Drake&#x27;s Bay, sending hunters into San Francisco Bay and the surrounding bays.

Kuskov sailed the brig &quot;Chirikov&quot; back to present day Bodega Harbor on March 15, 1812. Kuskov named it in honor of the Russian Minister of Commerce, Count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev. During 1812 Kuskov had Fort Ross built. Bodega Bay, located about south, served as the primary port for Fort Ross. RAC ships often stopped at Bodega Bay for repairs, such as the &quot;Il&#x27;mena&quot;, which was laid up at Bodega Bay for repairs from September 1815 to April 1816.
&quot;Zaliv Rumyantsev&quot; (Rumyantsev Bay, also transliterated &quot;Rumiantsov&quot; and &quot;Rumiantsev&quot;) appears on the earliest Russian charts of Bodega Bay (1817–1819) identifying present day Bodega Bay and Bodega Harbor. Bodega Head was named &quot;Mouis Rumyantsev&quot; (Point Rumyantsev). Tomales Point was named &quot;Point Great Bodega&quot; and Tomales Bay &quot;Great Bodega Bay&quot;, more or less conforming to Bodega y Quadra&#x27;s original naming.

On his return trip, Kuskov found the otter population scarce in Bodega Bay, and the harbor being frequented by numerous American and British otter-hunting expeditions. After exploring the area, they ended up selecting a place north that the native Kashaya Pomo people called &quot;Mad shui nui&quot; or &quot;Metini&quot;. &quot;Metini&quot;, the seasonal home of the native Kashaya Pomo people, had a modest anchorage and abundant natural resources and would become the Russian settlement of Fort Ross.

By 1817, sea otters in this area were practically eliminated by international over-hunting. &quot;Zaliv Rumyantsev&quot; continued to be the main &quot;entrepôt&quot; for the Russian Colony until January 1842, and the earliest European structures built at Bodega Bay were the RAC wharf, warehouse, and barracks.

After the Mexican–American War and the 1848 Mexican Cession Bodega Bay became United States territory. It remained an active harbor for shipping lumber until the 1870s, when the North Pacific Coast Railroad was built, bypassing the coast in favor of a more inland route.

A plan by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to build a nuclear power plant received significant negative attention from local citizens, beginning in 1958. By 1964, the plans for the plant were abandoned.

Bodega Bay was the setting for the 1963 Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;The Birds&quot; starring Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren and Suzanne Pleshette.

In October, 2017, Bodega Bay, on the northwest edge of Sonoma County, served as a site of refuge and supply depot for evacuees who are escaping from a historic, fast-moving, destructive fire in northern California, especially residents from that area. People from Santa Rosa and other regions affected by the raging wildfire started pouring in not long after the blazes started.

<text>Giovanni Capurro (February 5, 1859 – January 18, 1920) was an Italian poet, best remembered today as the co-creator, with singer/composer Eduardo Di Capua, of the world famous song, &quot;&#x27;O sole mio&quot;.

Capurro was born in Naples. He made his living as a poet and playwright. He is considered to be among the finest nineteenth-century Italian poets. The actor Viviani gave his first performance in an established theatre, the Teatro Perella in Basso Porto, in &quot;The Street Urchin&quot;, a sketch by Capurro.

In 1898, Giovanni Capurro wrote the words to&quot; &#x27;O Sole mio&quot; and asked Eduardo Di Capua (who at the time was in Odessa with his orchestra-violinist father) to set it to music. The song was later presented at Piedigrotta 1898, organized by the &quot;Round Table&quot; promoted by the publisher Bideri, and came in second place after a piece called &quot;Napule Bello!&quot;. But in popular appeal, this result was quickly overturned.&quot; &#x27;O Sole mio&quot; became famous. Even so, it made little money for its creators.

Capurro lived in financial scarcity his entire life. An artist for art&#x27;s sake, he was not concerned about receiving credit for his best-known creation. For thirty years he was associated with the newspaper &quot;Rome&quot; as a reporter, drama critic, and, late in life, as an administrative employee. Capurro was a devotee of lounges where he sang, played the piano and did amusing imitations.

Capurro died in 1920; some sources say in Naples while others say Mexico City.

<doc id="573040" wikidata="Q2720470" url="?curid=573040" title="Freezepop">
<text>Freezepop is an American electronic band from Boston, Massachusetts, United States, formed in 1999 by Liz Enthusiasm, Sean T. Drinkwater, and The Duke of Pannekoeken (an alias for Kasson Crooker). Since December 2009, the current lineup includes Enthusiasm, Drinkwater, Robert John &quot;Bananas&quot; Foster, and Christmas Disco-Marie Sagan. The band is named after the frozen snack, and they have described their music as &quot;sweet and cold and fruity and plastic-y&quot;.

Several of the band&#x27;s songs have appeared in video games, including the Harmonix titles &quot;Frequency&quot;, &quot;Amplitude&quot;, &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot;, &quot;Phase&quot;, the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series, the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series, and Neon FM. Their music has also been included in &quot;Downhill Domination&quot; and &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3&quot;. Freezepop songs continue to appear in certain Harmonix titles. Former member Kasson Crooker currently works as a senior producer at Harmonix.

The group is popular with college students in Boston and has become part of the US synthpop scene.

==Early life==
Christmas Disco-Marie Sagan (Ashley Holtgraver) once wrote a letter to &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; that was read out-loud in the episode &quot;Fire Maidens from Outer Space&quot;. She later appeared with &quot;Joel Hodgson&quot; in the series&#x27; Turkey Day 2015.

==Background==
Originally, their music was entirely composed on a small portable MIDI sequencer, a Yamaha QY70, which has often been mistaken for a Game Boy. On more recent albums, they have expanded their toolkit due to a lack of variety in the sounds the QY70 provided, but it still remains an important part of the composing process. The release of &quot;Future Future Future Perfect&quot; only features the QY70 in a single song, that being &quot;Pop Music Is Not a Crime&quot;.
In addition to Freezepop, Kasson, who had previously been in fellow Boston band Splashdown, still records as a solo artist Symbion Project. Drinkwater is also a member of the bands Lifestyle and Karacter, and worked with the band Polystar on their debut album. Enthusiasm appears on the song &quot;Boom Box Chic&quot; by Los Angeles-based LeMans Electro.

In addition to dozens of remixes released over the years, Freezepop released a remix of their song &quot;Shark Attack&quot; done by chiptune band 8 Bit Weapon in October 2007. The remix was done with a Nintendo Entertainment System and a Commodore 64 computer. 
A recurring theme in Freezepop&#x27;s music is references to science, technology, and mathematics. As examples, the &quot;hi-phive&quot; mix of &quot;Science Genius Girl&quot; features Enthusiasm reciting the first thirty digits of Phi. Additionally, the &quot;Robotron 2002&quot; &quot;All Your Base Are Belong to Us&quot; remix by DJ Nebula pays homage to the Internet meme All your base are belong to us.

Freezepop was arrested in Canada in November 2006 for trying to enter the country under false pretenses. Harmonix pokes fun at them for this in the loading screens for their songs, in &quot;Rock Band&quot; and &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;.

On June 4, 2009, it was announced on Freezepop&#x27;s official website that founding member the Duke of Pannekoeken (originally the Duke of Candied Apples, as well as the Duke of Belgian Waffles, all three pseudonyms of Crooker) would be leaving the band. Crooker stated, &quot;My responsibilities at Harmonix making games continue to increase which takes away from my time and energy to compose and go out on the road to play shows.&quot; He also added that he had plans to focus on his side endeavor Symbion Project while also doing Freezepop remixes in the future. His last show as a member of the band was at the Penny Arcade Expo 2009 in Seattle on September 5.

On November 25, 2009, the band announced the addition of two new members: Robert John &quot;Bananas&quot; Foster and Christmas Disco-Marie Sagan.

On April 25, 2016, the band launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to raise money for a fifth studio album to follow &quot;Imaginary Friends&quot; (2010). They posted a video, along with a photo of a royalty check of $2.93 that they received for online music streaming services. The band&#x27;s initial goal was US $30,000, which was reached in less than 24 hours. Their next goal of $40,000 was reached, which allowed the band to also release the album on vinyl. More stretch goals have been set for additional content, such as collaborations and a remix album. The album, titled &quot;Fantasizer&quot;, was released on October 6, 2020.

=== Soundtrack appearances ===
Along with bands such as The Aquabats, Bad Credit, and Slowdraw the Hungry Eskimo, their music is featured in the comedy series &quot;Mega64&quot;, which also produced the music video for Freezepop&#x27;s song &quot;Brainpower&quot;.

Freezepop&#x27;s song &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; was featured in the episode &quot;Liquid Heat&quot; in the fifth season of &quot;The L Word&quot;, originally aired March 2, 2008. &quot;Frontload&quot; was featured in the final episode of the fourth season of MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Hills&quot;, which originally aired on December 22, 2008. In 2010. their song &quot;Less Talk, More Rokk&quot; was featured in &quot;The Fourth Panel&quot;, a web TV series from the webcomic &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Freezepop won Best New Band at the 2002 American Synthpop Awards and were semifinalists on WBCN&#x27;s Rumble competition. In early 2006, Freezepop&#x27;s &quot;Stakeout&quot; won in the Dance/Electronica – Song category at The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards.

<doc id="573041" wikidata="Q4043083" url="?curid=573041" title="Live in Las Vegas (Elvis Presley album)">
<text>Live in Las Vegas is a four-disc box set by American singer and musician Elvis Presley, released in July 2001 on RCA Records, catalogue 07863 69354-2. It comprises live recordings from shows given by Presley in Las Vegas through every decade of his career.

==Content==
Disc one comprises a complete show from August 24, 1969, and disc two a complete show from August 11, 1970. Discs three and four present recordings from shows over a time span from 1956 through 1975, not in chronological order.

In his review of the album, music critic Lindsay Planer stated:
:A vibrant and overwhelmingly energetic Presley is the focus of the first two discs - containing complete performances from August 24, 1969, and August 11, 1970, respectively. As one may well anticipate, the sets feature a healthy sampling of Presley&#x27;s voluminous back catalogue. &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, and &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; are given a workout during each performance. As were the more current hits such as &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot;. Presley&#x27;s knack for inimitable remakes is also displayed as he gains inspiration from concurrent chart-toppers such as &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;, and &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot;. Unlike the first two discs, the final pair do not contain complete performances and likewise are not presented chronologically. For the sake of contrast, the four song mini-set documenting the final performance of Presley&#x27;s first Vegas stand on May 6, 1956, begins disc four. What remains consistent - in both the brief 1956 set as well as on the remainder of the mid-&#x27;70s recordings - is Presley&#x27;s impeccable taste in cover material.

<doc id="573043" wikidata="Q1494550" url="?curid=573043" title="Reserve Bank of New Zealand">
<text>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) () is the central bank of New Zealand. It was established in 1934 and is currently constituted under the &quot;Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 2021&quot;. The governor of the Reserve Bank, currently Adrian Orr, is responsible for New Zealand&#x27;s currency and operating monetary policy.

==History==
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand was established from 1 August 1934 by the &quot;Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1933&quot;. The Reserve Bank first issued banknotes in 1934, see New Zealand pound.

The &quot;Banking (Prudential Supervision) Act 1989&quot;, which came into effect in February 1990, resulted in the Reserve Bank becoming independent of government control in RBNZ&#x27;s role of managing monetary policy by introducing an inflation targeting mandate. New Zealand was the first country in the world to try this regime, which was later adopted in other countries.

The &quot;Reserve Bank of New Zealand Amendment Act 2008&quot; 
included amendments to the &quot;BPSA 1989&quot;, including the introduction of capital requirements for deposit takers.

The &quot;Non-Bank Deposit Takers Act 2013&quot;
gave RBNZ the role of prudential regulator and licensing authority for non-bank deposit takers.

The bank&#x27;s primary functions and responsibilities have been modified several times over its history. In 2018, the Labour-led coalition government passed the &quot;Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Monetary Policy) Amendment Act 2018&quot;, which created the bank&#x27;s monetary policy committee and codified &quot;maximum sustainable employment&quot; as an objective of monetary policy alongside price stability.

In 2021, the Government passed the &quot;Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 2021&quot;, which created a new statutory governance board that was appointed by the Governor-General of New Zealand at the advice of the Government and Reserve Bank Governor. The &quot;RBNZA 2021&quot; also designated the New Zealand Treasury as the bank&#x27;s external monitor, mandated that the bank publish annual performance expectations and financial risk management statements, and establish a new Foreign Reserves Coordination Framework.

2021 also saw the &quot;Financial Market Infrastructures Act 2021&quot; enacted, creating a regulatory regime for financial market infrastructures.

In December 2023, the National-led coalition government passed the &quot;Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Economic Objective) Amendment Act 2023&quot; which eliminated maximum sustainable employment as an objective of the Bank and returned the Bank to its primary focus of managing price stability.

===Museum===
The Reserve Bank Museum, based at the bank&#x27;s headquarters in Wellington Central, has been open to the public since 2006.

==Ownership==
The Reserve Bank has been wholly owned by the New Zealand Government since 1936. The Reserve Bank is established by &quot;the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 2021&quot; and has statutory independence. The Reserve Bank is accountable to Parliament and provides an annual dividend to the Government.

==Monetary policy==
The Reserve Bank&#x27;s primary function, as defined by the RBNZ Act 2021 is to provide &quot;stability in the general level of prices&quot; and &quot;maximum sustainable employment&quot;.

The Reserve Bank is responsible for independent management of monetary policy to maintain price stability. The degree of price stability is determined through a Policy Target Agreement with the Minister of Finance. Policy Target Agreements are public documents and hence a government cannot secretly change the targets to gain a short term surge in economic growth.

The mechanism of this is the official cash rate which affects short-term interest rates. The bank will provide cash overnight at 0.50% above the cash rate to banks against good security with no limit. Furthermore, the bank will accept deposits from financial institutions with interest usually at the official cash rate.

Banks that offer loans at interest higher than the official cash rate will be undercut by banks that offer cheaper loans, and banks that loan out lower than the official cash rate will make less compared to other banks which can simply deposit their money in the Reserve Bank with a higher rate of return. The Reserve Bank borrows and offers loans with no limit on volumes in order to ensure that the interest rate in the market remains at the official cash rate level.

Through controlling this, the Reserve Bank can then influence short term demand in the New Zealand Economy and use this to control prices.

Adjustments to the official cash rate are made eight times a year. It can make unscheduled adjustments but does not usually do so.

==Fractional-reserve banking==
Like all modern monetary systems, the monetary system in New Zealand is based on fiat and fractional-reserve banking. In a fractional-reserve banking system, the largest portion of money created is not created by the Reserve Bank itself. Private sector commercial banks create 80% or more.

== Issuing of currency ==
The bank by virtue of the Reserve Bank Act has the sole right of issuing New Zealand legal tender notes and coins. The Reserve Bank controls the issuing of currency to banks and also replaces used and damaged money from circulation. In March 2005, the bank decided to remove the 5 cent coin from circulation (the following year), as well as reducing the size of 10, 20 and 50 cent coins.

The Reserve Bank accepts all New Zealand currency for payment at face value. This applies to all demonetised or withdrawn currency, however such currency need not be accepted by money changers as it is no longer legal tender. All decimal notes are legal tender except $1 and $2 notes as these have been withdrawn.
Damaged notes are still worth something so long as they are recognisable. The Reserve Bank website notes that as a rule of thumb if there is more than half a bank note they will pay its full value. To receive payment people have to turn in the note to either the Reserve Bank in Wellington or any bank.

New Zealand Banknotes are signed by the RBNZ Governor. Between 1940 and 1984 they were signed by the RBNZ Chief Cashier, the first of whom was T. P. Hanna.

===Central Bank Digital Currency===
The RBNZ has been evaluating the pros and cons of issuing a central bank digital currency since 2018. 
In April 2024, the RBNZ held a public consultation on the move toward a digital dollar. This digital currency would coexist with physical cash while offering privacy, security, and trust for users.

=== Collectors coins ===
The Reserve Bank from time to time produces limited runs of legal tender coins for collectors and have a New Zealand theme and design. These coins generally do not circulate, but are legal tender. The coins are sold for the Reserve Bank via New Zealand Post&#x27;s business unit.

==Prudential regulation==
The Reserve Bank is responsible for the Prudential regulation of the New Zealand banking system to ensure that the system remains healthy, however it does not guarantee that a bank will not fail, or face problems. 
 there are 27 registered banks.

===Capital Adequacy, BS2===

New Zealand-incorporated registered banks are required to maintain a minimum level of capital relative to their risk-weighted assets, measured by their Capital adequacy ratio. This helps ensure that banks have enough money to cover any losses they might incur.

===Liquidity, BS13===

policy mandating the minimum amount that a commercial bank must hold in liquid assets. The liquidity policy of New Zealand&#x27;s locally incorporated registered banks is primarily governed by two banking prudential requirements documents: &#x27;Liquidity policy&#x27; (BS13) and &#x27;Liquidity policy annex – liquid assets&#x27; (BS13A). These documents are part of the banks&#x27; conditions of registration. Additionally, reporting requirements are imposed under section 93 of the Banking (Prudential Supervision) Act 1989.

===Disclosure, BS7===
All registered banks operating in New Zealand must issue a quarterly disclosure statement, which the Reserve Bank scrutinise. The purpose of these disclosure statements is to assist depositors to make sound decision and encourage banks to maintain sound banking practices

The disclosure comprises:
* A key information summary that provides a brief overview of the bank&#x27;s financial condition
* General disclosure statement to provide comprehensive information on the bank
* Supplemental disclosure statement

===Credit Ratings===
Under section 80 of the BPSA 1989, the RBNZ requires that all registered banks must have a valid credit rating for their long-term, senior, unsecured obligations in New Zealand dollars. These ratings, provided by independent agencies, assess a bank&#x27;s financial stability and likelihood of repaying its debts. The RBNZ maintains a register of these ratings for each registered bank, which are also disclosed in the banks&#x27; semi-annual statements.

===Outsourcing, BS11===
The RBNZ outsourcing policy, Banking Standard 11, applies to large New Zealand-incorporated registered banks. 
Outsourcing occurs when a bank uses another party to perform business functions that would traditionally have been undertaken by the bank itself. Common examples include IT processing, accounting, and call centers.
The outsourcing policy aims to ensure that large banks have the legal and practical ability to control and execute outsourced functions. It ensures that outsourcing arrangements do not compromise a bank&#x27;s ability to be effectively administered under statutory management and operate for the purposes of continuing to provide and circulate liquidity to the financial system and the wider economy.
The bank must be able to facilitate basic banking services by any new owner of all or part of the bank. They must also address the impact of service or function provider failures on the bank&#x27;s ability to carry on its business.
Large banks must achieve specific outcomes, including:
* Meeting daily clearing, settlement, and other time-critical obligations.
* Monitoring and managing financial positions (credit, liquidity, and market risk).
* Providing basic banking services to existing customers, including liquidity and account activity reporting.

===Connected Exposures, BS8===
NZ registered banks are required to report their large exposures to RBNZ. This includes not only the large exposures but also the 20 largest exposures, even if they do not meet the large exposure threshold.

Connected exposures occur when multiple counterparties are linked through control relationships or economic interdependence. For example, if one company controls another, or if the financial health of one entity directly affects another, they are considered connected.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has set guidelines to limit large exposures. A large exposure is defined as any exposure that is 10% or more of a bank’s Tier 1 capital. For global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), the limit is stricter, capping exposures to other G-SIBs at 15% of Tier 1 capital.

These regulations aim to prevent banks from incurring significant losses due to the default of a single counterparty or a group of connected counterparties. This helps in maintaining the stability of the financial system by reducing the risk of cascading failures.

===Open Bank Resolution, BS17===
&#x27;Open Bank Resolution (OBR)&#x27; is a tool for dealing with a bank failure. OBR allows authorities to reopen a failed bank the next day under statutory control. It seeks to prevent abrupt disruptions to the bank&#x27;s essential functions. while a long-term solution to the bank&#x27;s failure is found, customers can promptly access their accounts to make and receive payments. 
OBR places the cost of a bank failure on the bank&#x27;s shareholders and creditors, rather than taxpayers. Shareholders lose their investment first, followed by creditors if necessary.
Creditor claims may be frozen to absorb losses, and they may suffer financial loss if the bank is unable to satisfy its obligations.
In the absence of OBR, the only ways to deal with a bank failure are liquidation, government bailout, or acquisition by a competitor.
OBR covers banks with local incorporation that have more than $1 billion in retail deposits. The OBR programme is voluntary for other registered banks to participate in.

===Macroprudential regulation===
The goal of Macroprudential regulation is to reduce the likelihood of a financial crisis by limiting excessive lending during upturns and making banks and households more resilient during downturns. It focuses on risks to the financial system as a whole.

A Memorandum of Understanding between the Minister of Finance and the RBNZ Governor defines macroprudential policy and has guidelines for how we use the policy.
===Trans-Tasman Council on Banking Supervision===
The RBNZ is a member of the council, which promotes the coordination and harmonisation of trans-Tasman bank regulation, where appropriate. Its mandate also covers potential issues relating to financial stability, efficiency, and integration throughout the wider financial sector.
===Basel Committee on Banking Supervision===
 Supervision
The Reserve Bank largely follows the 2010 Basel III standards in implementing its bank capital requirements.

===Deposit Takers Act===
In June 2023 the Deposit Takers Act replaced the &quot;RBNZ Act 1989&quot; and the &quot;NBDTA 2013&quot; as the foundational law regulating Deposit Takers (New Zealand banks, building societies and credit unions).

It creates a single regulatory regime for all deposit takers and a deposit insurance scheme.

== Insurance industry supervision ==
Under section 12 of the &quot;Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010&quot;, the RBNZ is charged with the prudential supervision of the New Zealand insurance industry. This includes the licensing of persons to carry on insurance business in New Zealand.

=== Regulation of non-bank deposit takers (NBDTs) ===
Under Part 5D of the &quot;RBNZ Act 1989&quot;, the RBNZ was charged with the enforcement of the credit rating and prudential requirements applying to non-bank deposit takers (NBDTs) in New Zealand. These functions were introduced by the enactment of the &quot;Reserve Bank of New Zealand Amendment Act 2008&quot;.

Under the &quot;NBDT 2013&quot; the RBNZ acts as the prudential regulator and licensing authority for NBDTs.

==Governors==

<text>Crystal City is an urban neighborhood in the southeastern corner of Arlington County, Virginia, approximately 5 miles south of Downtown Washington, D.C. Due to its extensive integration of office buildings and residential high-rise buildings using underground corridors, travel between stores, offices, and residences, it is possible to travel much of the neighborhood without going above ground, making at least part of Crystal City an underground city.

Crystal City includes several aerospace manufacturing and defense industry companies, public sector consulting firms, government contractors, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Marshals Service, satellite offices for the Pentagon, and various nonprofit organizations, including the International Foundation for Electoral Systems and the national headquarters for PBS.

Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the busiest airport in the Washington metropolitan area and 23rd-busiest airport in the nation with 11,553,850 passengers as of 2022, is located in Crystal City.

==Cityscape==
Crystal City is centered along a stretch of U.S. Route 1, also known as Richmond Highway, just south of the Pentagon, east of Pentagon City, and within walking distance of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the busiest of the three major airports in the Washington metropolitan area. Characterized as one of several urban villages by Arlington County, Crystal City is almost exclusively populated by high-rise apartment buildings, corporate offices, hotels, and numerous shops and restaurants. There is also an extensive network of underground shopping areas and connecting corridors beneath Crystal City.

Crystal City has a station on the Washington Metro&#x27;s Blue and Yellow Lines, and another on the Virginia Railway Express commuter train system.

Crystal City&#x27;s layout was considered avant-garde at the time of construction in 1963 with superblocks bounded by arterial and circulating roads and pedestrian traffic and the businesses serving it relocated from the streets to pedestrian tunnels. Crystal City has since been redesigned to give it a more traditional, urban feel, with restaurants at street level, and with traffic patterns changed to make major streets like Crystal Drive function as city streets, rather than as circulating roads.

==History==
===20th century===

Before Crystal City&#x27;s development by the Charles E. Smith Company, the area was underutilized with light industrial activity and motels next to National Airport before the age of more consistent business travel. A drive-in theater existed at the intersection of Jefferson Davis Highway and 20th Street South between 1947 and 1963 is visible on aerial photos from this period. Tracks from the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad were moved closer to National Airport to provide additional room for development.

Though it is not a planned community, Crystal City unfolded in much that fashion after construction began on the first few condominiums and office buildings in 1963. The name &quot;Crystal City&quot; came from the first building, which was called &quot;Crystal House&quot; and had an elaborate crystal chandelier in the lobby. Every subsequent building initially took on the Crystal name, including Crystal Gateway and Crystal Towers, and others. Crystal City is largely integrated in layout with extensive landscaping with most of its high-rise buildings featuring speckled granite exteriors.

Crystal City&#x27;s Crystal Underground shopping mall opened in September 1976. Billed as a &quot;turn-of-the-century shopping village,&quot; it featured antique leaded glass shop windows and cobblestone &quot;streets&quot;. Emphasis was on locally owned and operated businesses and personalized service. The largest retail outlets were a Jelleff&#x27;s women&#x27;s store, Larimers gourmet grocery and delicatessen, and a Drug Fair. The mall also featured an Antique Alley with small antique and craft stores. At its opening in 1976, there were 40 stores and anticipated expansion of with 70 more shops, including the Crystal Palace food court.

===21st century===
Beginning in June 2004, the Crystal City area underwent a number of changes. Many buildings&#x27; addresses were changed on this date, several major roads were turned into two-way streets, and many of the markings for the traditional building names, including Crystal Gateway 1, were removed. As a result, local residents often refer to building names that are difficult for visitors to find.

In 2010, Arlington County developed the Crystal City Sector Plan, which presented the community&#x27;s vision to transform Crystal City into a more inviting, lively, and walkable community with more ground-floor retail, better quality office space, and more housing options. This 40-year plan, which won the American Planning Association’s 2013 National Planning Achievement Award for Innovation in Economic Planning and Development, was credited with pioneering the use economic analysis for planning purposes and closely studying the economic impact of demolishing and replacing major commercial buildings.

==Economy==
Crystal City currently has over 22,000 residents, while around 60,000 come to work there every weekday.

Crystal City is home to the headquarters of the U.S. Marshals Service and several Department of Defense offices. It also has offices of the General Services Administration and satellite offices for the Pentagon, many of which were built or occupied during the Pentagon Renovation Program. Pentagon offices in Crystal City include the headquarters of the Warrior Transition Command and the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

US Airways once maintained its headquarters in the Crystal Park Four building in Crystal City. After US Airways merged with America West Airlines in 2005, the combined company closed the Virginia headquarters and moved the management to Tempe, Arizona, in Greater Phoenix.

Several companies, associations, and organizations are headquartered in Crystal City, including Boeing, Bloomberg Industry Group, the American Diabetes Association, PBS, the American Public Power Association, and the Consumer Technology Association, and others.

===Amazon HQ2===
On November 13, 2018, Amazon.com announced that Crystal City would be the location of one of two campuses for its Amazon HQ2; the other campus will be located in Long Island City in Queens, New York City. Both campuses are expected to employ approximately 25,000 workers.

In Amazon&#x27;s announcement with Northern Virginia bidders, it announced that its HQ2 neighborhood location would be jointly marketed as &quot;National Landing&quot;, which encompasses Crystal City and part of Pentagon City and Potomac Yard. In February 2019, Amazon decided to cancel its plans for the Queens location for HQ2 and instead focus exclusively on the Crystal City location, and construction for it is ongoing.

<doc id="573054" wikidata="Q11183742" url="?curid=573054" title="Niter">
<text>Niter or nitre is the mineral form of potassium nitrate, KNO3. It is a soft, white, highly soluble mineral found primarily in arid climates or cave deposits.

Historically, the term &quot;niter&quot; was not well differentiated from natron, both of which have been very vaguely defined but generally refer to compounds of sodium or potassium joined with carbonate or nitrate ions.

== Characteristics ==
Niter is a colorless to white mineral crystallizing in the orthorhombic crystal system. It is the mineral form of potassium nitrate, , and is soft (Mohs hardness 2), highly soluble in water, and easily fusible. Its crystal structure resembles that of aragonite, with potassium replacing calcium and nitrate replacing carbonate. It occurs in the soils of arid regions and as massive encrustations and efflorescent growths on cavern walls and ceilings where solutions containing alkali potassium and nitrate seep into the openings. It occasionally occurs as prismatic acicular crystal groups, and individual crystals commonly show pseudohexagonal twinning on [110]. Niter and other nitrates can also form in association with deposits of guano and similar organic materials.

==History and etymology==
Niter as a term has been known since ancient times, although there is much historical confusion with natron (an impure sodium carbonate/bicarbonate), and not all of the ancient salts known by this name or similar names in the ancient world contained nitrate. The name is from the Ancient Greek from Ancient Egyptian , related to the Hebrew , for salt-derived ashes (their interrelationship is not clear).

The Hebrew may have been used as, or in conjunction, with soap, as implied by Jeremiah 2:22, &quot;For though thou wash thee with niter, and take thee much soap...&quot; However, it is not certain which substance (or substances) the Biblical &quot;neter&quot; refers to, with some suggesting sodium carbonate.

The Neo-Latin word for sodium, , is derived from this same class of desert minerals called (French) through Spanish from Greek (), derived from Ancient Egyptian , referring to the sodium carbonate salts occurring in the deserts of Egypt, not the nitratine (nitrated sodium salts) typically occurring in the deserts of Chile (classically known as &quot;Chilean saltpeter&quot; and variants of this term).

A term (, or aphronitre) which translates as &quot;foam of niter&quot; was a regular purchase in a fourth-century AD series of financial accounts, and since it was expressed as being &quot;for the baths&quot; was probably used as soap.

Niter was used to refer specifically to nitrated salts known as various types of saltpeter (only nitrated salts were good for making gunpowder) by the time niter and its derivative nitric acid were first used to name the element nitrogen, in 1790.

== Availability ==

Because of its ready solubility in water, niter is most often found in arid environments and often in conjunction with other soluble minerals like halides, iodates, borates, gypsum, and rarer carbonates and sulphates. Potassium and other nitrates are of great importance for use in fertilizers and, historically, gunpowder. Much of the world&#x27;s demand is now met by synthetically produced nitrates, though the natural mineral is still mined and is still of significant commercial value.

Niter occurs naturally in certain places like the &quot;Caves of Salnitre&quot; (Collbató) known since the Neolithic. In the &quot;Cova del Rat Penat&quot;, guano (bat excrements) deposited over thousands of years became saltpeter after being leached by the action of rainwater.

In 1783, Giuseppe Maria Giovene and Alberto Fortis together discovered a &quot;natural nitrary&quot; in a doline close to Molfetta, Italy, named Pulo di Molfetta. The two scientists discovered that niter formed inside the walls of the caves of the doline, under certain conditions of humidity and temperature. After the discovery, it was suggested that manure could be used for agriculture, in order to increase the production, rather than to make gunpowder. The discovery was challenged by scholars until chemist Giuseppe Vairo and his pupil Antonio Pitaro confirmed the discovery. Naturalists sent by academies from all Europe came in large number to visit the site; since niter is a fundamental ingredient in the production of gunpowder, these deposits were of considerable strategic interest. The government started extraction. Shortly thereafter, Giovene discovered niter in other caves of Apulia. The remnants of the extraction plant is a site of industrial archaeology, although currently not open to tourists.

== Similar minerals ==
Related minerals are soda niter (sodium nitrate), ammonia niter or gwihabaite (ammonium nitrate), nitrostrontianite (strontium nitrate), nitrocalcite (calcium nitrate), nitromagnesite (magnesium nitrate), nitrobarite (barium nitrate) and two copper nitrates, gerhardtite and buttgenbachite; in fact all of the natural elements in the first three columns of the periodic table and numerous other cations form nitrates which are uncommonly found for the reasons given, but have been described. Niter was used to refer specifically to nitrated salts known as various types of saltpeter (only nitrated salts were good for making gunpowder) by the time niter and its derivative nitric acid were first used to name the element nitrogen, in 1790.

<doc id="573060" wikidata="Q1372850" url="?curid=573060" title="Trevanian">
<text>Rodney William Whitaker (June 12, 1931 – December 14, 2005) was an anti American film scholar and writer who wrote several novels under the pen name Trevanian. Whitaker wrote in a wide variety of genres, achieved bestseller status, and published under several other names, as well, including Nicholas Seare, Beñat Le Cagot, and Edoard Moran. He published the nonfiction book &quot;The Language of Film&quot; under his own name.

Between 1972 and 1983, five of his novels sold more than a million copies each. He was described as &quot;the only writer of airport paperbacks to be compared to Zola, Ian Fleming, Poe, and Chaucer.&quot; Whitaker adamantly avoided publicity to hide his antisemitism and hatred of America for most of his life, his real name a closely held secret for many years. The 1980 reference book &quot;Twentieth-Century Crime and Mystery Writers&quot; listed his real name in its Trevanian entry.

==Life==
Born in Granville, New York, Whitaker became enthralled with stories as a boy. His family struggled with poverty. He lived for several years in Albany, New York, as a youth (a time portrayed in his last published work).

Whitaker earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in drama at the University of Washington. While there, he wrote and directed his three-act play &quot;Eve of the Bursting&quot;, which was his master&#x27;s thesis production in the UW Playhouse. The company manager and assistant director of the production was Jerry Pournelle. Whitaker went on to earn a doctorate in communications and film at Northwestern University.

He taught at Dana College in Blair, Nebraska, where he was chairman of the communications division. He served in the US Navy during the Korean War. Later, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship for study in England.

When Whitaker wrote his first two novels, he was chairman of the Department of Radio, TV, and Film at the University of Texas at Austin, where he continued to teach for many years.

Whitaker married the former Diane Brandon, and they had three children: Christian, and daughters Alexandra and Tomasin. They lived for years in the Basque countryside of France. He had a son, Lance, from a previous marriage. 

Whitaker died December 14, 2005, in Somerset, England. He was survived by his wife and grown children.

==Literary works==
Whitaker said his wife chose the pen name Trevanian based on her appreciation of English historian G. M. Trevelyan. Trevanian wrote many bestselling novels in different genres, which received highly favorable critical reviews.

His first novel, published at the age of 40 when he was teaching at the University of Texas, was &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot;, a thriller that became a worldwide best seller. In 1975, it was adapted as a movie directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. Trevanian described the movie as &quot;vapid&quot; in a footnote in his later novel &quot;Shibumi&quot;. He requested (and received) a screenwriting credit as Rod Whitaker. The balance of the script was written by Warren Murphy, the mystery writer perhaps best known for co-writing the &quot;Destroyer&quot; series of action novels.

Saddened that some critics did not recognize the story as a spoof, Trevanian followed it with a more intense spoof, &quot;The Loo Sanction&quot; (1973), which depicted an ingenious art theft. Then came &quot;The Main&quot; (1976), a detective novel set in a poor neighborhood of Montreal, featuring widowed, 50-ish police lieutenant Claude LaPointe. Trevanian originally intended to publish &quot;The Main&quot; under the pen name Jean-Paul Morin.

Next came &quot;Shibumi&quot; in 1979, a meta-spy novel, which received the most critical acclaim. In 1983, he published &quot;The Summer of Katya&quot;, a psychological horror novel. The wide diversity of genres led to a popular theory that &quot;Trevanian&quot; was a collective pen name for a group of writers working together. Under the name Nicholas Seare, Trevanian also published &quot;1339...or So: Being an Apology for a Pedlar&quot; (1975), a witty medieval tale of love and courage; and &quot;Rude Tales and Glorious&quot; (1983), a bawdy retelling of Arthurian tales.

After a 15-year hiatus, Trevanian returned with a Western novel called &quot;Incident at Twenty-Mile&quot; (1998), and then a collection of short stories, &quot;Hot Night in the City&quot; (2000). His last published novel, written while he was in declining health, was &quot;The Crazyladies of Pearl Street&quot; (2005), an autobiographical coming-of-age story of a boy surviving with his mother and sister in the slums of Albany, New York, in the years preceding and during World War II. In November 2005, it was selected as one of 11 Editors&#x27; Choice books by the Historical Novel Society.

&quot;Street of the Four Winds&quot;, Trevanian&#x27;s tale of Parisian artists caught in the 1848 revolution, based on his research of the era, remains unpublished. An excerpt is posted on Trevanian&#x27;s web site.

In 2005, Crown Publishers reprinted five of Trevanian&#x27;s early books—&quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot;, &quot;The Loo Sanction&quot;, &quot;The Main&quot;, &quot;The Summer of Katya&quot;, and &quot;Shibumi&quot;—as a trade paperback set.

Whitaker kept his true identity unknown for years. He refused to grant interviews or contribute to the publicity efforts of his publishers. His first known interview was granted to Carol Lawson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; for a June 10, 1979 article coinciding with the release of &quot;Shibumi&quot;. In this article, Trevanian stated that &quot;Trevanian is going out of business. Now he can talk.&quot;

It was rumored that Trevanian was Robert Ludlum writing under a pen name. Trevanian rejected that idea, stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know who he is. I read Proust, but not much else written in the 20th century.&quot;

Trevanian wrote successfully in several genres. In a 1998 interview with &quot;Newsweek&quot;, he said that with each new book, he first decided what author should tell the story. He used method-acting techniques to imagine himself as the author to work into the story he wanted to tell. Trevanian fans followed his style changes with delight.

Trevanian said of his fans:

The Trevanian Buff is a strange and wonderful creature: an outsider, a natural elitist, not so much a cynic as an idealist mugged by reality, not just one of those who march to a different drummer, but the solo drummer in a parade of one.

This was another poke at the masses—most notably the United States and Americans in general—since his apparent disillusion with the country led him to abandon it. In later years, Trevanian was more outspoken about the reasons surrounding his voluntary exile from the country of his birth; he cited US material obsession as one of the main reasons behind the declining quality of life in the United States. He said that one day Americans would wake up and realize that cheaper is not necessarily better. Trevanian also addressed the issue of value on his website.

<doc id="573069" wikidata="Q473986" url="?curid=573069" title="Southeast Asian mancala">
<text>Southeast Asian mancalas are a subtype of mancala games predominantly found in Southeast Asia. They are known as congkak in Malaysia; congklak (VOS Spelling: tjongklak), congkak, congka, and dakon in Indonesia and Brunei; and sungkâ in the Philippines. They differ from other mancala games in that the player&#x27;s store is included in the placing of the seeds. Like other mancalas, they vary widely in terms of the rules and number of holes used.

==Names==
Southeast Asian mancalas are generally known by variations of similar cognates which are likely onomatopoeiac. The names have also come to mean the cowrie shells, predominantly used as the seeds of the game. These names include &quot;congkak&quot; in Malaysia, (VOS Spelling: &quot;tjongklak&quot;; also spelled as &quot;tsjongklak&quot; in Dutch sources), , , and in Indonesia, Brunei, and Singapore, and &quot;sungkâ&quot; (also spelled &quot;chonca&quot; or &quot;chongca&quot; by Spanish sources) in the Philippines.

Historical records show that similar games also existed in Sri Lanka (where it is known as &quot;chonka&quot;) and India. In Tamil Nadu, India, it is known as Pallanguzhi. A similar game is still found in the Maldives, where it is known as &quot;ohlvalhu&quot; (where &quot;valhu&quot; means &quot;eight&quot;, so literally &quot;eight holes&quot;). It has also spread to the Marianas (where it is known as &quot;chongka&quot;) and Taiwan via relatively recent Filipino migrations.

Other names for the game include &quot;&quot; or &quot;dhakon&quot; (Javanese), &quot;kunggit&quot; (Philippines), &quot;dentuman lamban&quot; (Lampung), &quot;mokaotan&quot;, &quot;maggaleceng&quot;, &quot;aggalacang&quot; or &quot;nogarata&quot; (Sulawesi), and &quot;naranj&quot; (Maldives).

==History==
The oldest mancala game boards were found in a ruined fort of Roman Egypt and date back to the 4th century AD. The original route of dispersal of mancalas into Southeast Asia is unknown. It may have originally entered Southeast Asia via Austronesian trading routes with South Asia.

Indonesia has the largest variation of Southeast Asian mancalas and thus may be likely to be at least one of the major entry points, though this may also be just an artifact of the country&#x27;s size. Where the characteristic Southeast Asian ruleset originates from is still unknown.

==Description==

Southeast Asian mancalas are played by two people on carved wooden elongated boat-shaped boards with cup-shaped holes. Most variants have two sets of seven holes for each player, plus two larger holes at each end which are known as the &quot;stores&quot; of the players. However, the number of holes can vary, ranging from three to nine or more (excluding the stores), and these variants (which can also differ in the rules) can coexist in one area.

Mancala games are played with &quot;seeds&quot; or &quot;counters&quot;, which are usually made from small cowrie shells, pebbles, or tamarind seeds. The holes in Southeast Asian mancalas are typically deeper and larger than variants in mainland Asia and Africa, since the seeds used are larger. A total of 98 pieces are used in the seven-hole board version.

In Malaysia, the holes are called &quot;lubang&quot; (&quot;hole&quot;), while the larger store holes are called &quot;rumah&quot; (&quot;house&quot;). In Indonesia, the holes are called &quot;anak&quot; (&quot;child&quot;), while the larger store holes are called &quot;indung&quot; (&quot;mother&quot;). In the Philippines, the holes are called &quot;bahay&quot; or &quot;balay&quot; (&quot;house&quot;), while the store hole is called &quot;ulo&quot; (&quot;head&quot;).

==Rules==
The rules for the most common seven-hole mancala versions in Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, the Maldives, Marianas, and the Philippines are almost identical. Each player controls the seven holes on the side of the board to their left and their score is the number of seeds in their store holes. Seven seeds are placed in each small hole except for the players&#x27; store hole. The objective of the game is to capture more seeds in the store than one&#x27;s opponent.

Both players begin simultaneously by scooping up all the seeds in any hole on their side. Each drops a seed into the next hole and continues clockwise depositing one seed into every hole thereafter. A player drops a seed into their store each time they pass it but does not deposit any into their opponent&#x27;s store.

How the game continues, depends on where the last seed of each scoop is deposited.

*If the seed drops into the player’s own store: the player scoops up the seeds from any of their holes and distributes them in the holes round the board but not in their opponent&#x27;s store.
*If the seed drops into a hole (on either side of the board) containing seed: The player scoops up all of the seeds in that hole and continues distributing them as described above.
*If the seed drops into an empty hole belonging to the player: the player is entitled to collect the seeds in their opponent&#x27;s store directly opposite their own. These seeds collected from their opponent&#x27;s holes together with their last seed are deposited in their own store. If the opponent&#x27;s store opposite their own is empty, they deposit only their last seed in their own store. They forfeit their turn and stop playing. It is the opponent&#x27;s turn now to distribute the seeds.
*If the seed drops into an empty hole belonging to the opponent: the player forfeits their turn and stops playing. They also forfeit their seeds and leave it in the opponent&#x27;s hole. It is the opponent&#x27;s turn now to distribute the seeds.

The first round ends when a player has no more seeds in their holes. The remaining seeds are awarded to their opponent.

Play resumes in the second round with players redistributing seeds from their own store to their own holes. Beginning from left to right, seven seeds are placed in each hole. If a player does not have sufficient seeds to fill their own holes, the remaining holes are left empty and are considered &#x27;burnt&#x27;. The leftover seeds are deposited into their own store. The opponent deposits excess seeds they have won into their own store.

The loser gets to start the second round. Play is continued as before but players will bypass &#x27;burnt&#x27; holes and no seeds are to be dropped into these holes. If a seed is accidentally dropped into a &#x27;burnt&#x27; holes, it is confiscated and stored in the opponent&#x27;s store.

Play continues until one player loses all of their holes or concedes defeat.

==Cultural significance==
The game is regarded as useful for developing certain mathematical principles.

The second series Malaysian Ringgit 10 sen coin has a Congkak board on the reverse in recognition of the long history of congkak in Malaysia.

==Dakon stones==
In Java, the term &quot;dakon stone&quot; refers to the similarly pitmarked stones from the bronze-iron age period of Indonesia. These stones have rows of 4 or 5 cup-shaped holes (called &quot;cupules&quot; in archaeology) and two holes at each end, a formation which has much in common with that of &quot;congklak&quot;. This prehistoric dakon stones is unrelated to the game and were probably employed in ceremonies to propitiate ancestors. Such stones can be found around Java.

Similar cup-shaped depressions are also found in other Austronesian cultures, most notably in Polynesia.

<text>SUNY Adirondack is a public community college in Queensbury, New York.

<text>Frequency (usually stylized as FreQuency) is a rhythm video game developed by Harmonix and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It was the first game to be developed by Harmonix. A sequel, &quot;Amplitude&quot;, was released in 2003.

==Gameplay==
In the game, a player portrays a virtual avatar called a &quot;FreQ&quot;, and travels down an octagonal tunnel, with each wall containing a musical track. These tracks contain sequences of notes. As the player hits buttons corresponding to the note placement on the track, the &quot;sonic energy&quot; from within is released and the music plays. If the player plays two measures of the track without any errors, the track is &quot;captured&quot; and the music plays automatically until the next pre-determined section of the song. All songs featured in the game are edited for ease of play.

Some tracks are bonus tracks and only open up when all notes are played, allowing the user to pick up &quot;freestyle&quot; points. Powerups are available which allow the immediate capturing of the track or the doubling of points. If a player continually misses notes, their energy meter reduces until the game is over.

High scores are achieved in the game by quickly moving from track to track, as they are completed, which increases a point multiplier. Tracks with more notes are worth more points, so choosing those over simple tracks is advantageous as well.

The game features eight different &#x27;arenas&#x27; that the player could attempt the song in. These arenas, as well as the tracks and notes, take on the appearance of &quot;Tron&quot;-style graphics, including limited video screens that would show the player&#x27;s FreQ if the player was doing well, or static if the player was about to run out of power. Depending on the arena chosen, the track would curve and loop around indefinitely until the end of the song. One arena is noted for being a completely straight track, thus working well as a practice arena for some of the more difficult songs.

&quot;Frequency&quot; allowed players to create remixes of any of the songs in the game. While the player was limited to the instruments and structure of the song, the remix could include different melodies or beat lines, change in tempo, and modulation of the sound of an instrument. Remixes could then be saved and played as normal songs, though no high score records are kept for these.

&quot;Frequency&quot; was one of the first games to be supported by the PS2 Network Adapter, allowing for up to four players to play against each other as well as to trade their remixes. Online play was added with an online-capable demo version (4 songs), supplied with the network adapter. The original disk could also be swapped after loading the demo disk, allowing online play with all songs. Multiplayer mode has all players attempting to complete the song on the same track, allowing for players to fight for the highest score. New powerups only available in multiplayer mode are able to disrupt the performance of another player. However, Sony has shut down the matchmaking server for online play and has made no provisions for third-party replacements.

==Songs==
Some of the songs are actually &quot;in-house&quot; productions by Kasson Crooker, who served as a musical director for the game and is also a former member of the band Freezepop. Some of his aliases include: DJ HMX (HMX standing for Harmonix, the game&#x27;s developer), Symbion Project, and Komputer Kontroller. Several of the artist featured in the game would contribute to its sequel &quot;Amplitude&quot;. These artists include The Crystal Method, BT, Akrobatik, Chris Child (Kodomo, of Surgecore), Melissa Kaplan, Freezepop, as well as Crooker himself returning with his various pseudonyms.

&quot;Cosmic Assassins&quot; by DJ Q-Bert is the version featured in the movie Wave Twisters, not the version found on the album of the same name. In the European version, there is one extra song on the first stage, called &quot;Reeload - Why&quot;. Hidden within the game&#x27;s files there are two more songs, named &quot;BT - Godspeed&quot; and &quot;Kareem Caines - Scratchotronic&quot;. These are accessible through a patch.

==Development==
Harmonix had originally pitched the concept of &quot;Frequency&quot; to Microsoft but were told by now-former vice-president of game publishing Ed Fries that no music-rhythm game would succeed without a custom hardware controller. This advice indirectly led Harmonix to become involved with &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; with a custom guitar-shaped controller, and leading to a multi-billion dollar franchise.

==Reception==
Peter Suclu reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;America&#x27;s first homegrown rhythm action game is a lot of fun&quot;.

The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Despite the positive reception, Ryan Lesser, an art director at Harmonix, said that &quot;Frequency&quot; &quot;didn&#x27;t sell very well&quot;. &quot;Frequency&quot; won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Music/Rhythm Game&quot; award among console games, and was a runner-up for the publication&#x27;s &quot;Best Music&quot; and &quot;Most Innovative&quot; prizes.

During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Frequency&quot; for the &quot;Sound Design&quot; award.

<text>Independent People: An Epic () is a novel by Nobel laureate Halldór Laxness, originally published in two volumes in 1934 and 1935. It deals with the struggle of poor Icelandic farmers in the early 20th century, only freed from debt bondage in the last generation, and surviving on isolated crofts in an inhospitable landscape.

The novel is considered among the foremost examples of social realism in Icelandic fiction in the 1930s. It is an indictment of materialism, the cost of the &quot;self-reliant spirit&quot; to relationships, and capitalism itself. This book, along with several other major novels, helped Laxness win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Independent People&quot; is the story of the sheep farmer Guðbjartur Jónsson, generally known in the novel as Bjartur of Summerhouses, and his struggle for independence. As the story begins, Bjartur (&quot;bright&quot; or &quot;fair&quot;) has recently managed to put down the first payment on his own farm, after eighteen years working as a shepherd at Útirauðsmýri, the home of the well-to-do local bailiff, a man he detests. The land that he buys is said to be cursed by Saint Columba, referred to as &quot;the fiend Kolumkilli&quot;, and haunted by an evil woman named Gunnvör, who made a pact with Kólumkilli. The novel charts the drudgery and the battle for survival of life in Summerhouses, the misery, dreams and rebellions of the inhabitants, and what appears to be the curse of Summerhouses taking effect. 

Bjartur is newly married to a young woman called Rósa, a fellow worker at Rauðsmýri, and is determined that they should live as independent people. However, Rósa is miserable in her new home, which does not compare well to the luxury she was used to at Rauðsmýri. Bjartur also discovers that she is pregnant by Ingólfur Arnarson Jónsson, the son of the bailiff. In the autumn, Bjartur and the other men of the district ride up into the mountains on the annual sheep round-up, leaving Rósa behind with a ewe to keep her company. Terrified by a storm one night, desperate for meat, and convinced that the gimmer is possessed by the devil, Rósa kills and eats the animal.

When Bjartur returns, he assumes that Rósa has set the animal loose. When he cannot find her when it comes time to put the sheep inside for the winter, he once more leaves his wife, by now heavily pregnant, to search the mountains for the gimmer. He is delayed by a blizzard, and nearly dies of exposure. On his return to Summerhouses he finds that Rósa has died in childbirth. His dog Titla is curled around the baby girl, still clinging to life due to the warmth of the dog. With help from Rauðsmýri, the child survives; Bjartur decides to raise her as his daughter, and names her Ásta Sóllilja (&quot;beloved sun lily&quot;).

The narrative begins again almost thirteen years later. Bjartur is now remarried to a woman who had been a charity case in the parish, Finna. The other new inhabitants are Hallbera, Finna&#x27;s mother, and the three surviving sons of Bjartur&#x27;s second marriage: Helgi, Gvendur (Guðmundur) and Nonni (Jón). Most of the pregnancies are stillborn. The family lives in hardship but the arrival of a cow makes everyone in the family but Bjartur happy, especially Finna who develops a strong bond to the animal and takes it on walks. It is later found out that the cow is a gift from the Women&#x27;s Institute. Bjartur refuses to accept the gift and pays them back. 

The family faces a harsh winter that kills several sheep. Bjartur refuses to ask for help and borrow hay from other farmers or from Rauðsmýri. Bjartur kills the feeble family cow and Finna dies shortly thereafter. Afterwards a mysterious ghost starts killing sheep. The countrymen gather at the croft to pray. It is later found out that it was Helgi, who then flees his house. His body is found later in the book by Bjartur.

Bjartur travels to Vik to work as hired labor but sends the Teacher to the croft to give the children an education. The Teacher is sick with consumption and seems also to be addicted to a stimulant drug. One night he rapes Ásta, who becomes pregnant as a consequence, and is banished from Summerhouses by Bjartur for this reason.

Bjartur allows Nonni to leave for America. Some years after Nonni sends Gvendur money to come as well. On the day of his departure Gvendur chases a village girl, and misses his ship to America. He becomes infatuated and decides to buy a horse with his money. When he meets the girl again, she is not impressed, and Gvendur ends up staying and working with Bjartur at Summerhouses.

In the middle of the novel, World War I commences and the prices for Icelandic mutton and wool soar, so that even the poorest farmers begin to dream of relief from their poverty. Since Bjartur profits from the war, he takes a loan in order to build a new house. The build quality ends up being poor, and after the war ends he is unable to pay his loan. Summerhouses ends up being sold by the bank and Bjartur leaves Summerhouses to go to Hallbera&#x27;s land. On the way, he reunites with Ásta Sóllilja who is now a mother of two children, has tuberculosis, and will likely die soon.

==Themes==
The most important theme of the novel is independence, what it means and what it is worth giving up in order to achieve it. Bjartur is a stubborn man, often callous to the point of cruelty in his refusal to swerve from his ideals. Though undoubtedly a principled man, his attitude leads to the death and alienation of those around him.

There are strong economic themes, a discussion of the co-operative movement in Iceland and the exploitation of crofters like Bjartur by Danish merchants and rich Icelanders like Jón the Bailiff.

&quot;Independent People&quot; also reveals Laxness&#x27;s anti-war leanings in a chapter that depicts Icelandic farmers sitting around talking about the economic benefits of the Great War.

The ancient Icelandic sagas and Icelandic folklore are still alive in the stories and fables that the characters live with on a daily basis. The imaginations of the characters are inhabited by elves, ghosts and demons. Bjartur is also a talented poet, a living embodiment of the great oral tradition of the sagas.

&quot;The author&#x27;s ironical appraisal is already expressed in the title of the novel, and also in the titles of some of the chapters ... : &quot;Free of Debt&quot;, &quot;Years of Prosperity&quot;.&quot;

==Reaction==
The popular Icelandic poet Hulda wrote the two-volume novel, &quot;Dalafólk&quot; (People of the Valleys) as a reaction to &quot;Independent People&quot;. In contrast to Laxness&#x27; bleak view of rural life in Iceland, Hulda presents a somewhat idealized picture of the old manorlike farmsteads.

In her review of the 1997 Vintage International reissue of the English translation of the novel, Annie Dillard wrote, &quot;The greatest Scandinavians&#x27; work shows opposing strains of lyricism and naturalism... &quot;Independent People&quot; fits the dual bill: it is a mythic tale -- cum Marx.&quot;

<text>Franklin W. Dixon is the pen name used by a variety of different authors who were part of a team that wrote The Hardy Boys novels for the Stratemeyer Syndicate (now owned by Simon &amp; Schuster). Dixon was also the writer attributed for the &quot;Ted Scott Flying Stories&quot; series, published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap.

Canadian author Charles Leslie McFarlane is believed to have written the first sixteen Hardy Boys books, but worked to a detailed plot and character outline for each story. The outlines are believed to have originated with Edward Stratemeyer, with later books outlined by his daughters Edna C. Squier and Harriet Adams. Edna and Harriet also edited all books in the series through the mid-1960s. Other writers of the original books include MacFarlane&#x27;s wife Amy, John Button, Andrew E. Svenson, and Adams herself; most of the outlines were done by Adams and Svenson. A number of other writers and editors were recruited to revise the outlines and update the texts in line with a more modern sensibility, starting in the late 1950s.

The principal author for the Ted Scott books was John W. Duffield.

<doc id="573096" wikidata="Q377662" url="?curid=573096" title="Jeffrey Jones">
<text>Jeffrey Duncan Jones (born September 28, 1946) is an American actor, known for his roles as Emperor Joseph II in &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984), Edward R. Rooney in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986), Charles Deetz in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988), Dr. Skip Tyler in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), Eddie Barzoon in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1997), and A. W. Merrick in both &quot;Deadwood&quot; (2004–2006) and &quot;&quot; (2019).

His career started in Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, and advanced to London and Broadway. In film and television, Jones has had many roles which capitalized on his deadpan portrayal of characters in unusual situations, often to comic effect. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance in &quot;Amadeus&quot; and a Screen Actors Guild Award as part of the ensemble cast of &quot;Deadwood&quot;.

In 2003, Jones was charged with soliciting a minor to pose for nude photographs. He pleaded no contest and had two subsequent arrests for failing to update his sex offender status.

== Early life ==
Jones was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of Ruth (née Schooley) and Douglas Bennett Jones. His mother was an art historian, who urged him towards a career in acting. His father died when Jones was an infant.

==Early career==
After graduating from The Putney School in 1964, Jones enrolled in Lawrence University as a premed student, where his performances in university productions brought him to the attention of Tyrone Guthrie, who recruited him for the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

His stage career included more than 125 productions, starting with the Guthrie Theater, then internationally in South America, Canada, and London, and in New York Off-Broadway in &quot;Cloud 9&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;, among other productions, as well as on Broadway in productions including &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot; and &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;. His transition from stage to film began in 1970.

==Film and television career==
Jones began acting in small parts in film and television in the 1970s. In his best-known roles as Emperor Joseph II in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, Charles Deetz in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, and Edward R. Rooney in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, his dead-pan expression and distinctive face bring a comic flavor to his characters through their reactions to the situations in which they find themselves, more so than the wit in their scripted lines. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ biographic profile reads: &quot;Although he has tried to steer clear of playing only sinister roles, the actor&#x27;s imposing height, bugged-out eyes, easy sneer, and shock of reddish-blond hair give him vaguely devilish features that have prompted villain typecasting. However, the actor is also widely respected and considered a boon wherever he appears.&quot; The profile describes his portrayals variously as a &quot;hissable, cartoonish high school principal&quot; in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, a &quot;good-natured father&quot; in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;an interplanetary freedom fighter&quot; in &quot;Mom and Dad Save the World&quot;, a &quot;demon stand-in&quot; in &quot;Stay Tuned&quot;, and &quot;evil bespectacled twins&quot; in &quot;Out on a Limb&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s work in the Lucille Lortel Theatre production of &quot;Cloud 9&quot; was noticed by the casting team of &quot;Easy Money&quot; (1983), earning Jones a supporting role opposite Rodney Dangerfield.

===&quot;Amadeus&quot;===
&quot;Cloud 9&quot; further attracted the attention of director Miloš Forman, who cast Jones as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor in &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984), an adaptation of the Peter Shaffer play of the same name. Critic James Berardinelli noted that Jones portrayed the Emperor &quot;as a superficial and self-absorbed ruler who can&#x27;t tell the difference between a great opera and a mediocre one&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Jones&#x27;s performance, citing the film&#x27;s most memorable line, when the Emperor complains of &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; that &quot;there are too many notes&quot;. Jones&#x27;s work earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.

===&quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;===
Jones&#x27;s performance as Edward R. Rooney in the film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986) made him a cultural icon. Rooney, self-important and obsessed with catching the chronic truant Ferris Bueller, became a symbol of pomposity and authoritarian hatefulness. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ review characterized Jones&#x27;s performance as having &quot;fine cartoon like ferocity&quot;, wherein his character &quot;gets scratched, bitten, attacked by ferocious dogs and covered with mud while pursuing his weaker, but craftier prey, and emerges each time bruised but undaunted, thinking up some new (and futile) plan&quot;. The review likened Jones&#x27;s role as akin to that of Wile E. Coyote as a character who is fated to be unable to catch The Road Runner (Ferris Bueller). Jones expressed concern about being remembered more for this role than for &quot;Amadeus&quot;. Regarding its premise, he said: &quot;What&#x27;s amazing about Ferris Bueller, is that we&#x27;re asked to, and do, sympathize with a kid whose only complaint in life is that his sister got a car for her birthday and he got a computer.&quot;

===&quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and Tim Burton===
In the horror comedy film &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988), Jones and Catherine O&#x27;Hara portrayed a married couple (Charles and Delia Deetz) who unwittingly become co-owners of a haunted house. To highlight this couple&#x27;s status as boors, director Tim Burton cast Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet to appear as their guests at a dinner party, at which the ghosts of the previous owners cause everyone to sing &quot;Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)&quot;.

Jones collaborated with Burton again on the films &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), in which he portrays The Amazing Criswell, and &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1999). Shortly prior to the release of &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, Jones said of Burton, &quot;I&#x27;ve known Tim now for quite some time and really enjoy working with him. I like his sensibility, and he&#x27;s great fun.&quot;

===Other films===
Jones played Dr. Walter Jenning in the George Lucas film &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (1986). He portrayed Inspector Lestrade in the Sherlock Holmes spoof film &quot;Without a Clue&quot; (1988). In &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), he played ex-submarine commander Skip Tyler, who identifies the Red October&#x27;s propulsion system to Alec Baldwin&#x27;s Jack Ryan. He also appeared as real-life figure Thomas Putnam in &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996). He also played Uncle Crenshaw Little in &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (1999). As lumber mogul Joe Potter, Jones was the primary antagonist of the Eddie Murphy comedy &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; (2001).

===Television roles===
One of Jones&#x27;s earliest television roles was in an episode of the short-lived CBS series &quot;Sara&quot; (1976). He showcased his villain persona as the sinister Mister Acme (owner of Acme Toxic Waste) in the satirical comedy miniseries &quot;Fresno&quot; (1986), starring Carol Burnett, Charles Grodin and Dabney Coleman. For Disney, Jones hosted the 1987 D-TV Monster Hits musical special (as the Magic Mirror) and later co-starred with Tyra Banks, Kathy Najimy and Kevin Pollak in the video storyline portion of the Walt Disney World attraction Extraterrorestrial Alien Encounter, a staple of Tomorrowland from 1995 to 2003. He has had guest roles on a number of television series, including &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He was the star of another short-lived CBS program: the sitcom &quot;The People Next Door&quot; (1989), portraying a cartoonist whose imagination could make things come to life.

Jones&#x27;s most prominent television role is that of newspaper publisher A. W. Merrick on the acclaimed HBO drama series &quot;Deadwood&quot; (2004–2006). Keith Uhlich of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; referred to both Jones and the character of Merrick as &quot;perversely appropriate additions&quot; to the program, further citing Merrick as its &quot;secular soul&quot;. Along with the ensemble cast, Jones was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

==Later career==
Following his appearance in the golf comedy &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Caddy?&quot; (2007), he was absent from film and television for several years. He returned with an uncredited cameo as &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; editor Charles Colebaugh in the HBO original film &quot;Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn&quot; (2012), followed by the supporting role of scientist Gladstone in the independent disaster film &quot;10.0 Earthquake&quot; (2014). Jones went on to play a fictional version of himself in the short film &quot;7 Days&quot; (2016) and reprised the role of A. W. Merrick in &quot;&quot; (2019).

In May 2015, Jones returned to the stage with the New American Theatre production of &quot;63 Trillion&quot;, directed by Steve Zuckerman. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said his portrayal of financial adviser Dick had &quot;malevolent gusto that Satan himself might envy&quot;. Beginning in March 2018, Jones portrayed ailing patriarch Bradley in a production of the A. R. Gurney play &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot;, staged at the Annenberg Theater in the Palm Springs Art Museum.

Jones was not brought back to reprise his role as Charles Deetz in &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; (2024) due to his legal controversies. His character is explained to have been killed by being eaten by a shark after his plane crashed in the ocean, and his likeness is used through means of stop-motion in flashback sequences, as well as archival photos and footage throughout the film thereafter. In scenes set in the afterlife, Deetz is portrayed by a body double (with half of his body missing) and a voice impersonator, in a rare instance of a fake Shemp being used on a living actor with consent.

==Personal life==
Jones has one son, actor Julian Coutts, whose mother was Lloy Coutts (1941–2008), a Canadian voice coach. She and Jones met in Stratford, Ontario.

One interviewer in 1989 found Jones to value anonymity and the enjoyment of everyday tasks, like home repairs, and found him to be uninterested in status symbols and fan adulation. Jones pointed out that greater public recognition makes it more difficult to transition between roles and allow the character to come to the fore and the actor to recede from view.

==Legal issues==
=== Child sexual abuse materials ===
Jones was arrested in 2002 for possession of child sexual abuse material and soliciting a 14-year-old boy to produce sexually explicit images between September 2000 to May 2001. Jones photographed the child, and paid him to pose nude on multiple occasions wearing a cowboy hat, with stuffed animals, and dressed as a Native American. Jones surrendered himself and was released on bond prior to arraignment. Jones pleaded not guilty to the possession charge and no contest to a charge of soliciting a minor. The victim initiated a separate civil action against Jones seeking damages and compensation. The misdemeanor charge of possession of child pornography was dropped following the no-contest plea. His attorney emphasized that there was no allegation of improper physical contact. His punishment was five years&#x27; probation, counseling, and the requirement to register as a sex offender. Jones is listed in sex offender registries in California and Florida.

=== Other offenses ===
Jones was arrested twice for failing to update his sex offender status, first in Florida in 2004, and then in California in 2010. Jones pleaded guilty to the felony charges in California, receiving a sentence of 250 hours of community service and three years of probation. 

In 2006, Jones&#x27;s record became the subject of a community complaint during production of &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Caddy?&quot; in Aiken, South Carolina. Upon learning of his involvement, locals insisted that the public should have been alerted, considering that families were being invited to visit the set. Surrounding the 2019 release of &quot;Deadwood: The Movie&quot;, Jones&#x27;s crime was noted by the media.

<text>Joseph Warren (June 11, 1741 – June 17, 1775), a Founding Father of the United States, was an American physician who was one of the most important figures in the Patriot movement in Boston during the early days of the American Revolution, eventually serving as President of the revolutionary Massachusetts Provincial Congress. Warren enlisted Paul Revere and William Dawes on April 18, 1775, to leave Boston and spread the alarm that the British garrison in Boston was setting out to raid the town of Concord and arrest rebel leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams. Warren participated in the Battles of Lexington and Concord the following day, the opening engagements of the American Revolutionary War.

Warren had been commissioned a major general in the colony&#x27;s militia shortly before the June 17, 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. Rather than exercise his rank, Warren chose to participate in the battle as a private soldier, and was killed in combat when British troops stormed the redoubt atop Breed&#x27;s Hill. His death, immortalized in John Trumbull&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker&#x27;s Hill, June 17, 1775&quot;, galvanized the rebel forces. Warren has been memorialized in the naming of many towns, counties, streets, and other locations in the United States, by statues, and in numerous other ways.

==Biography==

Joseph Warren was born in Roxbury, Province of Massachusetts Bay, to Joseph and Mary (née Stevens) Warren. His father was a respected farmer who died in October 1755 when he fell off a ladder while gathering fruit in his orchard. After attending the Roxbury Latin School, Joseph enrolled in Harvard College, graduating in 1759, and then taught for about a year at Roxbury Latin. While teaching at Roxbury, Warren pursued postgraduate studies at Harvard, graduating with a Master of Arts degree in 1763 after defending a thesis against the proposition that all disease was caused by obstruction of bodily vessels. He married 18-year-old heiress Elizabeth Hooten on September 6, 1764. She died in 1773, leaving him with four children: Elizabeth, Joseph, Mary, and Richard. Before his death in 1775, he was engaged to Mercy Scollay.

While practicing medicine and surgery in Boston, he became involved in politics, associating with John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and other leaders of the broad movement labeled Sons of Liberty. He was one of the leaders of Patriot activities during the Liberty Affair and facilitated an agreement with Hancock and government customs officials prior to the Boston demonstrations.

Warren conducted an autopsy on the body of young Christopher Seider in February 1770, and was a member of the Boston committee that assembled a report on the following month&#x27;s Boston Massacre. Earlier, in 1768, Royal officials tried to place his publishers Edes and Gill on trial for an incendiary newspaper essay Warren wrote under the pseudonym &quot;A True Patriot&quot;, but no local jury would indict them.

In 1774, he authored the song &quot;Free America,&quot; which was published in colonial newspapers. The poem was set to a traditional British tune, &quot;The British Grenadiers.&quot;

Warren owned at least one enslaved person. This unnamed man, formerly held by Joshua Green, helped Warren with his medical practice.

==Lexington and Concord==
As Boston&#x27;s conflict with the royal government came to a head in 1773–1775, Warren was appointed to the Boston Committee of Correspondence. He twice delivered orations in commemoration of the Massacre, the second time in March 1775 while the town was occupied by army troops. Warren drafted the Suffolk Resolves, which were endorsed by the Continental Congress, to advocate resistance to Parliament&#x27;s Coercive Acts, which were otherwise known as the Intolerable Acts. He was appointed President of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, the highest position in the revolutionary government.

In mid-April 1775, Warren and Benjamin Church were the two top members of the Committee of Correspondence left in Boston. On the afternoon of April 18, the British troops in the town mobilized for a long-planned raid on the nearby town of Concord, and already before nightfall word of mouth had spread knowledge of the mobilization widely within Boston. It had been known to rebel leadership for weeks that General Gage in Boston had plans to destroy munitions stored in Concord by the colonials, and it was also known that they would be taking a route through Lexington.

Unsupported stories argue that Warren received additional information from a highly placed informant (usually claiming it was from Margaret Kemble Gage, the wife of General Thomas Gage), that the troops had orders to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock. However, there is little evidence of this as the troops apparently had no such orders. There is growing consensus in new scholarship that Mrs. Gage did not conspire against the British and that Warren needed no informant to deduce that the British were mobilizing.

Regardless, Warren learned there was some British expedition likely to begin that night, and so sent William Dawes and Paul Revere on their famous &quot;midnight rides&quot; to warn Hancock and Adams in Lexington.

Warren slipped out of Boston early on April 19, and during that day&#x27;s Battle of Lexington and Concord, he coordinated and led militia into the fight alongside William Heath as the British Army returned to Boston. When the enemy were returning from Concord, he was among the foremost in hanging upon their rear and assailing their flanks. During this fighting Warren was nearly killed, a musket ball striking part of his wig. When his mother saw him after the battle and heard of his escape, she entreated him with tears again not to risk life so precious. &quot;Wherever danger is, dear mother,&quot; he answered, &quot;there will your son be. Now is no time for one of America&#x27;s children to shrink from the most hazardous duty; I will either set my country free, or shed my last drop of blood to make her so.&quot; He then turned to recruiting and organizing soldiers for the Siege of Boston, promulgating the Patriots&#x27; version of events, and negotiating with Gen. Gage in his role as head of the Provincial Congress.

==Death==
Warren was commissioned into the Continental Army at the rank of major general by the Second Continental Congress on June 14, 1775. Three days later, he arrived at Charlestown just before the battle of Bunker Hill began and made his way to where Patriot militiamen were forming. Upon meeting General Israel Putnam, Warren asked where he thought the heaviest fighting would be; Putnam responded by pointing to Breed&#x27;s Hill. Warren subsequently volunteered to join the militia at the rank of private against the wishes of both Putnam and Colonel William Prescott, both of whom unsuccessfully requested that he serve as their commander instead. Warren declined their request due the fact that Putnam and Prescott held more military experience. 

During the early stages of the battle, Warren repeatedly stated that &quot;These fellows say we won&#x27;t fight! By Heaven, I hope I shall die up to my knees in blood!&quot; Defending the Patriot redoubt against two failed attacks by British troops, he kept firing his gun until running out of ammunition and was killed in action during the third and final assault by British gunfire. The man who killed him was possibly Lieutenant Lord Rawdon, who personally recognized him, or by a British officer&#x27;s servant, an account supported by a forensic analysis conducted in 2011. 

After the battle, Warren&#x27;s body was stripped of his clothing, repeatedly bayoneted and then buried in a shallow ditch by British forces. Captain Walter Laurie, who participated in the battles of Lexington and Concord, later wrote that he &quot;stuffed the scoundrel with another rebel into one hole, and there he and his seditious principles may remain.&quot; American soldier Benjamin Hichborn subsequently wrote a letter to John Adams on December 10, 1775, claiming that Lieutenant James Drew, a Royal Navy officer stationed onboard the sloop HMS &quot;Scorpion, went to Breed&#x27;s Hill &quot;a day or two&quot; after the battle and exhumed Warren&#x27;s body, &quot;spit in his face, jumped on his stomach, and at last cut off his head and committed every act of violence upon his body... In justice to the officers in general I must add, that they despised Drew for his Conduct.&quot; Warren&#x27;s body was exhumed again ten months after his death by his brothers and Paul Revere, who identified the remains by an artificial tooth Warren had installed in his jaw. His body was interred in the Granary Burying Ground. In 1825, it was exhumed and reinterred in St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Boston before being moved one final time in 1855 to his family&#x27;s vault in Forest Hills Cemetery.

==Legacy==
General Gage is rumored to have said that Warren&#x27;s death was equal to the death of 500 ordinary colonials. It encouraged the revolutionary cause because it was viewed by many Americans as an act of martyrdom.

At the time of Warren&#x27;s death, his children were staying with his fiancée, Mercy Scollay, in Worcester as refugees from the Siege of Boston. She continued to look after them, gathering support for their education from John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, Benedict Arnold, and even the Continental Congress. Joseph&#x27;s youngest brother and apprentice in medicine, John Warren, served as a surgeon during the Battle of Bunker Hill and the rest of the war, and afterwards founded Harvard Medical School and co-founded the Massachusetts Medical Society. 
There are at least four statues of Joseph Warren on public display. Three are in Boston: one in the exhibit lodge adjacent to the Bunker Hill Monument, another on the grounds of the Roxbury Latin School, and the third atop the puddingstone at his grave site at the Forest Hills Cemetery (this statue was commissioned by the 6th Masonic District, and dedicated in a ceremony by the Grand Master of Masons in Massachusetts on October 22, 2016). The fourth is in a small park on the corner of Third and Pennsylvania avenues in Warren, Pennsylvania, a city, borough, and county all named after the general.

Fort Warren on George&#x27;s Island in Boston harbor, started in 1833, was named in his honor. In 1840, the first Warren School was built on Salem Street in Charlestown, Massachusetts near Bunker Hill. It relocated to School and Summer Streets in 1868, and later merged with the Prescott School to form the Warren-Prescott School.

Fourteen states have a Warren County named after him. Additionally, Warren, Pennsylvania; Warren, Michigan; Warren, New Jersey; Warrenton, Missouri; Warrenton, Virginia; Warren, Maine; Warren, Massachusetts; Warrenton, North Carolina; Warren, Connecticut and 30 Warren Townships as well as Warrensville, Eldred Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania are also named in his honor.

The New York county of Warren is named after him, but the town of Warrensburg within that county is not; the town is in fact named after James Warren, a prominent early settler.

The streets of Detroit, Michigan, were redesigned after the 1806 fire, based on the Pierre L&#x27;Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C.; Warren Avenue in Detroit is named after Joseph Warren.

Five ships in the Continental Navy and United States Navy were named &quot;Warren&quot; in his honor.

Warren Square in Savannah, Georgia, is also named for him, as well as Warren Street in Trenton, New Jersey.

==Freemasonry==
Warren joined the Freemasons, being initiated in the St. Andrew&#x27;s Lodge, and later became Past Provincial Grand Master of Massachusetts.

Warren was a Scottish Freemason. He was a member of Lodge St Andrews, No.81, (Boston, Massachusetts), which held a Charter from the Grand Lodge of Scotland. The Lodge continues to meet in Boston under the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. The date he joined the Lodge is not known but was during the period after the inauguration of the Lodge on St Andrew&#x27;s Day, 30 November 1756 and 15 May 1769 when he is recorded in the Grand Lodge of Scotland&#x27;s membership register as being the Master of the Lodge. Paul Revere and William Palfrey are also recorded, in the same entry, with Revere being named as Secretary of the Lodge. Warren was appointed Grand Master of all Scottish Freemasonry in the 13 colonies by the Grand Lodge of Scotland.

He was appointed Grand Master of the newly established Provincial Grand Lodge of Massachusetts in that same year. Upon his death, Joseph Webb became Acting Grand Master.

The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts has an award in his name for Masons who have served the fraternity, the country, or humanity with distinction. It is the second-highest honor conferred by the Grand Lodge, surpassed by only the Henry Price medal. The Henry Price medal is usually awarded to those who served with distinction in the Grand Lodge, while the Joseph Warren medal may be conferred upon any Mason within the Grand jurisdiction.

==In popular culture==
Warren Lodge No. 32 of the Grand Lodge of New York is a historic Masonic lodge that meets in Schultzville, New York. It was founded in 1807 and named in memory of Joseph Warren.

Walter Coy portrayed Warren in the 1957 film &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot;. Warren also appeared in episodes 5 and 9 of the 2002 animated television show &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Kids&quot;.

Ryan Eggold was cast as Warren in the 2015 miniseries &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;.

Warren is featured in the song &quot;Wildfire&quot; by the band Mandolin Orange (renamed Watchhouse) on their 2016 album &quot;Blindfaller&quot;.

Joseph Warren is referenced in the A. W. Burns/George W. Hewitt song &quot;America Shall Aye Be Free&quot;.

<doc id="573098" wikidata="Q920305" url="?curid=573098" title="Dominant seventh chord">
<text>In music theory, a dominant seventh chord, or major minor seventh chord, is a seventh chord composed of a root, major third, perfect fifth, and minor seventh; thus it is a major triad together with a minor seventh. It is often denoted by the letter name of the chord root and a superscript &quot;7&quot;. In most cases, dominant seventh chord are built on the fifth degree of the major scale. An example is the dominant seventh chord built on G, written as G7, having pitches G–B–D–F:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&quot; {
 \clef treble 
 \time 4/4
 \key c \major
 &lt;g b d f&gt;1
&lt;/score&gt;

The leading note and the subdominant note combined form a diminished fifth, also known as a tritone. The clashing sound produced by playing these two notes together gives the dominant seventh chord its dissonant quality (i.e. its harmonic instability). 

Dominant seventh chords are often built on the fifth scale degree (or dominant) of a key. For instance, in the C major scale, G is the fifth note of the scale, and the seventh chord built on G is the dominant seventh chord, G7 (shown above). In this chord, F is a minor seventh above G. In Roman numeral analysis, G7 would be represented as V7 in the key of C major. 

This chord also occurs on the seventh degree of any natural minor scale (e.g., G7 in A minor). 

The dominant seventh is perhaps the most important of the seventh chords. It was the first seventh chord to appear regularly in classical music. The V7 chord is found almost as often as the V, the dominant triad, and typically functions to drive the piece strongly toward a resolution to the tonic of the key.

A dominant seventh chord can be represented by the integer notation {0, 4, 7, 10} relative to the dominant.

==History==
The majority of Renaissance composers conceived of harmony in terms of intervals rather than chords, &quot;however, certain dissonant sonorities suggest that the dominant seventh chord occurred with some frequency.&quot; Monteverdi (usually credited as the first to use the V7 chord without preparation) and other early Baroque composers begin to treat the V7 as a chord as part of the introduction of functional harmony.

An excerpt from Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Lasciatemi Morire&quot;, &quot;Lamento d&#x27;Arianna&quot; (1608) is shown below. In it, a dominant seventh chord (in red) is handled conservatively, &quot;prepared and resolved as a suspension, clearly indicating its dissonant status.&quot;

&lt;/score&gt;

The V7 was in constant use during the Classical period, with similar treatment to that of the Baroque. In the Romantic period, freer voice-leading was gradually developed, leading to the waning of functional use in the post-Romantic and Impressionistic periods including more dissonant dominant chords through higher extensions and lessened use of the major minor chord&#x27;s dominant function. Twentieth-century classical music either consciously used functional harmony or was entirely free of V7 chords while jazz and popular musics continued to use functional harmony including V7 chords.

An excerpt from Chopin&#x27;s Mazurka in F minor (1849), Op. 68, No. 4, mm. 1–4 is shown below with dominant sevenths in red: &quot;the seventh factor had by this time achieved nearly consonant status.&quot;

===Inversions===


The opening bars of Mozart’s Piano Sonata in C, K545 features dominant seventh chords in both second and first inversions:The concluding cadence of the same movement features the chord in root position:A striking use of inversions of the dominant seventh can be found in this passage from the first movement of Beethoven’s String Quartet Op. 127. Here, the second and third inversions contribute to the &quot;magnificently rich harmony&quot; :

===Function===

The function of the dominant seventh chord is to resolve to the tonic note or chord.

This dominant seventh chord is useful to composers because it contains both a major triad and the interval of a tritone. The major triad confers a very &quot;strong&quot; sound. The tritone is created by the co-occurrence of the third degree and seventh degree (e.g., in the G7 chord, the interval between B and F is a tritone).

In a diatonic context, the third of the chord is the leading-tone of the scale, which has a strong tendency to pull towards the tonic of the key (e.g., in C, the third of G7, B, is the leading tone of the key of C). The seventh of the chord acts as an upper leading-tone to the third of the scale (in C: the seventh of G7, F, is a half-step above and leads down to E). This, in combination with the strength of root movement by fifth, and the natural resolution of the dominant triad to the tonic triad (e.g., from GBD to CEG in the key of C major), creates a resolution with which to end a piece or a section, often in a cadence.

 »
&lt;/score&gt;

Because of this original usage, it also quickly became an easy way to trick the listener&#x27;s ear with a deceptive cadence. The dominant seventh may work as part of a circle progression, preceded by the supertonic chord, ii.

A non-diatonic dominant seventh chord (sometimes called a &quot;chromatic&quot; seventh) can be borrowed from another key, and this can provide a way for the composer to modulate to that other key. This technique is extremely common, particularly since the Classical period, and it has led to further innovative uses of the dominant seventh chord such as secondary dominant (V7/V, shown below), extended dominant (V7/V/V), and substitute dominant (V7/V) chords.

===Voice leading===
For common practice voice leading or &quot;strict resolution&quot; of the dominant seventh chord:
* In the V7–I resolution, the dominant, leading note, and supertonic resolve to the tonic, whereas the subdominant resolves to the mediant.
*:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \new PianoStaff «
 \new Staff «
 \relative c&#x27; {
 \voiceOne \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4

 »
&lt;/score&gt;
* In the other resolutions, the dominant remains stationary, the leading note and supertonic resolve to the tonic, and the subdominant resolves to the mediant.
*:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

 »
&lt;/score&gt;
* All four tones may be present, though the root may be doubled and the fifth omitted.
* The diminished fifth (if the seventh is above the third, as in the first measure below) resolves inwards while the augmented fourth (if the seventh is below the third, as in the second measure below) resolves outward. This means that the seventh resolves stepwise downwards while the third resolves upwards to the tonic though in such cases the root of the tonic chord may need to be tripled.
*:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;
* The root of the V7, when in the bass, resolves to the root of the I, in the bass.
* In an incomplete V7, with a missing fifth, the doubled root remains stationary.
* The &quot;free resolution of the seventh&quot; features the seventh in an inner voice moving stepwise upwards to the fifth of I

According to Heinrich Schenker, &quot;The dissonance is always passing, &quot;never a chord member&quot; (&quot;Zusammenklang&quot;),&#x27;&quot; and often (though by no means always) the voice leading suggests either a passing note:
:8 7 3
:5 5 1

or resolution of a (hypothetical) suspension:
:(8) 7 3
:(4) 5 1

=== In blues progressions ===
In rock and popular music songs following the blues progression, the IV and V chords are &quot;almost always&quot; dominant seventh chords (sometimes with extensions) with the tonic chord most often being a major triad. Examples include Bill Haley and the Comets&#x27; &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and Buster Brown&#x27;s &quot;Fanny Mae&quot;, while in Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot; and Loggins and Messina&#x27;s &quot;Your Mama Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; the tonic chord is also a dominant seventh. Used mostly in the first fifteen years of the rock era and now sounding somewhat &quot;retrospective&quot; (e.g., Oasis&#x27; &quot;Roll With It&quot;), other examples of tonic dominant seventh chords include Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Lucille&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Coconut&quot;, Jim Croce&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around With Jim&quot;, and The Drifters&#x27; &quot;On Broadway&quot;. Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; uses the dominant seventh on I, IV, and V.

The dominant seventh is enharmonically equivalent to the German sixth. For example, the German sixth A–C–E–F (which typically resolves to G) is equivalent to the dominant seventh A–C–E–G (which typically resolves to D):

The dominant seventh chord is frequently used to approximate a harmonic seventh chord, which is one possible just tuning, in the ratios 4:5:6:7 , for the dominant seventh. Others include 20:25:30:36 , found on I, and 36:45:54:64, found on V, used in 5-limit just tunings and scales.

Today, the dominant seventh chord enjoys particular prominence in the music of barbershop quartets, with the Barbershop Harmony Society describing the chord as the &quot;signature&quot; of the barbershop sound. A song may use the chord type (built on any scale degree, not just ), for up to 30 percent of its duration. As barbershop singers strive to harmonize in just intonation to maximize the audibility of harmonic overtones, the practical sonority of the chord tends to be that of a harmonic seventh chord. This chord type has become so ingrained into the fabric of the artform that it is often referred to as the &quot;barbershop seventh chord&quot; by those who practice it.

<text>Cordelia is a feminine given name. It was borne by the tragic heroine of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; (1606), a character based on the legendary queen Cordelia.

<doc id="573107" wikidata="Q2844464" url="?curid=573107" title="Amplitude (2003 video game)">
<text>Amplitude is a 2003 rhythm video game developed by Harmonix and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It is the sequel to &quot;Frequency&quot; (2001).

In &quot;Amplitude&quot; the player controls a beat blaster ship across a lane of six tracks, each track representing a musical instrument and containing note gems that the player shoots at in time with the music. The player earns points for accurate playing and increases their scoring multiplier by playing a series of flawless sequences; the player loses energy by missing too many notes and can end the song prematurely if they run out of energy. Compared to the original &quot;Frequency&quot; which used more electronica and trance music, &quot;Amplitude&quot; included additional pop rock songs in its soundtrack.

The game was met with a critical applause and a decent financial success, elevating Harmonix into a major studio in the development of music games. In 2014, Harmonix successfully offered a Kickstarter campaign to raise over $840,000 in funds to build a new &quot;Amplitude&quot; game for PlayStation 3 and 4 consoles; the reboot was released in January 2016 under license from Sony.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Amplitude&quot;, the player controls a ship (referred to as a &quot;Beat Blaster&quot;) moving down a path of varying shapes and lengths, containing up to six tracks. Each color-coded track corresponds to a different aspect of the song, such as percussion, synth, bass, or vocals, and contains a sequence of notes. As the player hits buttons corresponding to the note placement on the track, the notes activate a small portion of the track. If the player successfully activates enough notes in sequence, the track is &quot;captured&quot; and the section will play automatically for a number of bars, freeing the player to capture another section.

The object of the game is to capture a sufficient number of sections to reach the end of the song. If the player continually misses notes, an energy meter empties until the game is over.

There are several different powerups available to the player to make gameplay easier. Powerups are gained by activating a series of specially shaped and colored notes. Such powerups allow immediate capturing of tracks, doubling of points scored, slowing down the speed of play, and jumping into freestyle mode (which allows the player to riff to the music, gaining points without the difficulty of playing predefined tracks).

===Modes===
&quot;Amplitude&quot; offers four different modes of play: single player game, remix, multiplayer and online.

In single player, the object is to unlock and complete all of the songs. There are four levels of gameplay difficulty: Mellow, Normal, Brutal, and Insane. Certain songs are only available to play on harder difficulty settings. Often the player is rewarded with pieces to construct and customize their &quot;FreQ&quot; avatar.

The remix mode in &quot;Amplitude&quot; is much like the one in &quot;Frequency&quot;. The player may place notes to every section of the song (except the vocal section) in whatever patterns they so choose, creating a unique version of the song. The effects (chorus, delay, etc.) and tempo of the song are also controllable. Finished remixes are available for gameplay in both single player and multiplayer modes.

Multiplayer mode offers three distinct modes: a typical gameplay mode, a head-to-head mode and a remix mode. The main multiplayer mode offers up to four players simultaneous gameplay through any of the unlocked songs. The head-to-head mode features Simon says-esque gameplay between two players, in which the players alternate creating riffs and then attempting to play them back. The remix mode is identical to the single player remix mode, but with the participation of more players.

Online mode offered multiplayer play with an internet connection. Sony of America shutdown the online &quot;Amplitude&quot; servers on February 26, 2007, with the online servers in the European version of the game continuing to function until late 2011.

==Songs==
There are 26 songs in &quot;Amplitude&quot;, the majority of which are tracks by popular music artists, with genres ranging from electronica and dance to hip hop and alternative rock. Some of the tracks, however, were produced &quot;in-house&quot; specifically for &quot;Amplitude&quot;. Kasson Crooker, who served as the musical director for the game, contributed the songs &quot;Cool Baby&quot;, &quot;Synthesized&quot;, &quot;Robot Rockerz&quot; and &quot;Spaztik&quot;, as well as &quot;Super Sprøde&quot; as performed by his band Freezepop.

The following is a list of artists who contributed songs to the game, with a corresponding song title, in order of gameplay. The fourth song in each section is a &quot;boss&quot; song while the fifth is an unlockable bonus song. &quot;Spaztik&quot; is unlockable only in the Insane difficulty.

==Development==
&quot;Amplitude&quot; is the sequel to Harmonix&#x27;s previous title, &quot;Frequency&quot;, released in 2001. &quot;Frequency&quot; was funded and published by Sony, and while not a commercial success, was considered by Harmonix&#x27;s Ryan Lesser as the game that helped to give Harmonix a positive reputation in the game industry. Sony funded and published the game&#x27;s sequel.

In making the sequel, the team considered lessons they learned from &quot;Frequency&quot; to make &quot;Amplitude&quot; more enjoyable. One aspect was the &quot;tunnel&quot; approach they used in &quot;Frequency&quot;; this was borne out from trying to create a cyberspace-like environment based on concepts from the movie &quot;Tron&quot; as to help create a synaesthesia for the player. However, on reflection, they found this tunnel to be limiting and claustrophobic; further, in testing an initial prototype for &quot;Amplitude&quot;, they found that when they left the tunnel, the experience of seeing the tunnel from the outside inspired the idea of vaster landscapes. The tunnel approach also limited an effective means for local multiplayer. This prompted the team to change from the tunnel to a spread-out track for &quot;Amplitude&quot;. The flatter track enabled players to have a better concept of where they were on the instrument spread, though the decision was criticized by fans of &quot;FreQuency&quot;.

The second factor they considered was that both &quot;Frequency&quot; and &quot;Amplitude&quot;, published at a time where most video game coverage was based on print media, did not come off clearly in static screenshots. The screens appeared confusing and had little personality to them, according to Lesser. They came up with the idea of the &quot;FreQ&quot;, an avatar that would be on-screen, performing with the music, as to help create some personality with the game; the FreQs would also help to emphasise the player-vs-player nature during multi-player.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Star Dingo of &quot;GamePro&quot; called it &quot;a purveyor of positive energy, a game that rewards you for acts of creation instead of destruction...the world would be a happier place with more games like it.&quot;

&quot;Amplitude&quot; sold more units than its predecessor, &quot;Frequency&quot;, but it wasn&#x27;t considered a financial success for Harmonix.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best PlayStation 2 game of March 2003 in review. It also won the award for &quot;Best Game No One Played&quot; in &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2003 Awards.

<doc id="573110" wikidata="Q308644" url="?curid=573110" title="G-Unit">
<text>G-Unit (short for Gorilla-Unit) was an American hip hop group formed by longtime friends and East Coast rappers 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, and Lloyd Banks. After amassing a string of self-released mixtapes in the early 2000s, the group released their debut album &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot; in 2003, which went on to ship over four million copies in the US and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
During Tony Yayo&#x27;s imprisonment in 2003, the group recruited Tennessee-based rapper Young Buck as a temporary replacement and later an official member. Californian rapper The Game was also made a member in late 2003 after &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot;, in an effort to promote him after he was signed to Aftermath/Interscope; he was ousted from the group in February 2005 for alleged disloyalty according to 50 Cent. In April 2008, Young Buck was ousted from the group due to his problematic behavior. In July 2008, the group released their second studio and final album, &quot;T·O·S (Terminate on Sight)&quot;, featuring the original trio.

In early 2014, Yayo and 50 Cent both separately stated that G-Unit was no more. However, the group members reconciled and reunited soon thereafter, now becoming a quintet, with the rejoining of Young Buck and the addition of G-Unit Records artist Kidd Kidd. The group performed at Summer Jam 2014 and then released their first collaborative project in six years, the EP &quot;The Beauty of Independence&quot;, in August of the same year.

In 2018, Kidd Kidd announced that he was leaving both the group and label to become independent; Lloyd Banks and Young Buck followed suit after revolved disputes with 50 Cent. In 2022, 50 Cent confirmed that the group had once again disbanded and stated that there would never be a reunion, citing disaffection with the other members.

==History==
===Formation and early years (2001–2002)===

The group&#x27;s founding members, 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo were all friends raised in South Jamaica, a neighborhood in the Queens borough of New York City, New York, and began rapping together. After 50 Cent lost his record deal with Columbia Records in 2000, the group began recording music independently, and released several mixtapes between 2002 and 2003, the most prominent of these being &quot;50 Cent Is the Future&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Plan&quot;, &quot;No Mercy, No Fear&quot; and &quot;Automatic Gunfire&quot;.

===Debut album and success (2002–03)===

In 2002, 50 Cent was discovered by Eminem and signed a $1 million contract with Shady Records, under the aegis of Dr. Dre&#x27;s Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. After signing to Interscope, he was granted his own record label, which led to the creation of G-Unit Records. 50 Cent immediately signed both Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo to the label, and they began working on G-Unit&#x27;s debut album, however, Tony Yayo was incarcerated at the time and was unable to record any new material for the album, which led to 50 Cent signing Tennessee-based rapper Young Buck to G-Unit Records and subsequently adding him to the group. After the signing of Young Buck, G-Unit made their first major label appearance as a group on the remix to 50 Cent&#x27;s single &quot;P.I.M.P.&quot;, which featured Snoop Dogg, Banks and Young Buck.

Later in November 2003, the group released their debut studio album, &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot;. The album featured guest appearances from R&amp;B singers Joe and Butch Cassidy, and production was handled by high-profile producers such as Hi-Tek, Dr. Dre and Scott Storch, among several others. 50 Cent also served as the album&#x27;s executive producer. Due to Tony Yayo&#x27;s incarceration, he only made two appearances on the album, both of which used pre-recorded material. His face is seen on the brick wall of the album cover because he could not be photographed on account of his jail sentence. &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot; went on to sell over 3.9 million units in the U.S., 5.8 million copies worldwide, and has since been certified quadruple Platinum by the RIAA.

===Feud with The Game/solo albums (2004–07)===

During the production of &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot;, Los Angeles rapper The Game was discovered and placed into G-Unit by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine of Interscope Records. Their plan was to market The Game as a devotee, or a loyal member of 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;camp&quot;. The Game made his first appearances as a member of G-Unit on Lloyd Banks&#x27; and Young Buck&#x27;s debut albums, &quot;The Hunger for More&quot; and &quot;Straight Outta Cashville&quot;. Throughout 2004, The Game began working on his debut studio album, which was set to be executive produced by 50 Cent and Dr. Dre. In November 2004, the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;How We Do&quot; featuring 50 Cent became a top 5 hit, as did the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Hate It or Love It&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, being held back from the top spot by 50 Cent&#x27;s single, &quot;Candy Shop&quot; featuring Olivia.

Beginning in 2005, tensions began to rise between 50 Cent and The Game, and shortly after the release of &quot;The Documentary&quot;, tensions escalated into a full-scale feud which led to 50 Cent announcing that The Game had been kicked out of G-Unit, with 50 Cent saying he had not received full credit for writing six songs from &quot;The Documentary&quot;. The two held a press conference on March 9, 2005, calling a truce between the two of them and seeming to publicly squash the feud. However, shortly after, The Game and G-Unit continued to attack one another, releasing numerous diss tracks throughout 2005 and 2006.

In 2006, rapper Lil&#x27; Scrappy joined G-Unit for one album, Bred 2 Die, Born 2 Live, selling 82,000 copies.

50 Cent offered Lil Scrappy a joint deal with G-Unit and BME after the head busser rapper got into an incident that left him unable to rap.

In 2007 while leaving a studio, Tony Yayo (one third of G-Unit), and his friend Lodi Mack saw Jimmy Henchman&#x27;s (The Game&#x27;s manager) 14-year-old son. The two proceeded to assault the 14 year old which would lead to Lodi Mack&#x27;s arrest. He was sentenced to two years in Prison and in 2009 Jimmy Henchman hired a hitman to kill Lodi Mack. In 2017, Jimmy Henchman was found guilty of murder and is now spending 2 life sentences in prison.

===Second album and dissension (2008–13)===
On April 7, 2008, in an interview with Shanna Leviste on New York&#x27;s Hot 97 FM, 50 Cent stated that Young Buck was no longer a member of G-Unit, but was still signed to G-Unit Records. 50 Cent said problems involving excessive spending and Young Buck&#x27;s public statement to not being paid royalty checks and &quot;inconsistent behavior&quot; from Young Buck, such as appearing on stage with his former Cash Money label-mate Lil Wayne, then seemingly dissing him on records with G-Unit were the main reasons for his removal.

On June 17, 2008, Young Buck responded to 50 Cent&#x27;s allegations with the song &quot;Taped Conversation&quot;. 

Their second album, &quot;T&quot;·&quot;O&quot;·&quot;S (Terminate on Sight)&quot;, was released on July 1, 2008. As a result of Young Buck&#x27;s removal from the group, Young Buck still appeared on songs previously recorded with the group, but was credited as a featured artist. As of August 8, 2008, the album had sold 507,000 copies in the United States. Along with Young Buck, reggae singer Mavado appears on the album, while production came from Swizz Beatz, Street Radio, Tha Bizness, Rick Rock and Polow da Don, among several others.

===Reunion and EPs (2014–17)===
On February 20, 2014, Tony Yayo said that G-Unit had officially broken up, saying he and 50 Cent were no longer friends, and also announced his retirement from music, saying it had caused him too much stress and that he had already accomplished everything he wished to do. Then, after what seemed like condescending comments made about Lloyd Banks and Yayo in multiple interviews, on April 25, 2014, 50 Cent said that due to the recent inside-fighting, G-Unit was currently &quot;dismantled.&quot; Despite this, on June 1, 2014, G-Unit reunited at the 21st annual Summer Jam with 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, and G-Unit&#x27;s newest member, Louisiana rapper Kidd Kidd appearing on stage together. The following day, G-Unit released a song titled &quot;Nah I&#x27;m Talkin&#x27; Bout&quot;, a remix of HS87&#x27;s &quot;Grindin My Whole Life&quot;, making their comeback official. Throughout June 2014, G-Unit released numerous remixes to popular songs by other artists, including Drake, Trey Songz, and Jeremih, as well as an original song, &quot;They Talked About Jesus&quot;. On June 4, 50 Cent announced they were working on a studio album and revealed plans to release it by late November 2014, and on June 25, 2014, announced they would be releasing a mixtape prior to the album. On August 25, 2014, G-Unit surprised fans with an extended play (EP) titled &quot;The Beauty of Independence&quot;, which was released at midnight, via digital retailers.

After the first EP, the group released music videos for &quot;Watch Me&quot; and &quot;Changes&quot;. G-Unit planned to release the second EP in November, but after the release of &quot;The Beauty of Independence&quot;, it was announced that the album would divided into two parts, &quot;The Beauty of Independence&quot; and &quot;The Beast Is G-Unit&quot;. The group planned to release &quot;The Beast&quot; in late October, but the EP was pushed back to a later release in 2015. On November 10, 2014, a deluxe version of &quot;The Beauty of Independence&quot; was released, containing two new songs, &quot;Ease Up&quot; and &quot;Big Body Benz&quot;. On January 20, 2015, the cover art for &quot;The Beast Is G-Unit&quot; was revealed via social media. The Beast Is G-Unit was released on March 3, 2015.

In August 2016, they released &quot;The Lost Flash Drive&quot;, composed of numerous unreleased songs.

===Final projects and disbandment (2018–22)===
On April 11, 2018, Kidd Kidd announced his departure from both the group and G-Unit Records to focus on his own label, RLLNR Entertainment.

On February 1, 2018, in his single &quot;Crazy&quot; featuring PnB Rock, 50 Cent said he and Lloyd Banks were no longer on speaking terms, and in June, Banks and 50 Cent announced his departure from both the group and the label via Instagram.

On September 2, 2020, 50 Cent stated during an Instagram Live interview with DJ Whoo Kid that he wanted to erase the group and their success from his memories &quot;forever&quot;. He also echoed accusations that Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo&#x27;s inconsistencies were what caused him to blame himself for their failures as solo artists. With him and Tony Yayo left as the only members of the original lineup by this time, on August 3, 2022, 50 Cent stated on &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; that he was done &quot;carrying&quot; the group and there would not be another G-Unit album; this was confirmation that G-Unit had officially broken up for the second time.

==Other ventures==
===Clothing line===
The G-Unit Clothing Company was established in 2009, when 50 Cent teamed up with Marc Ecko (the founder of Eckō Unlimited), to create a line of clothing and accessories inspired by 50 Cent and fellow members of G-Unit.

===G-Unity Foundation===
G-Unit has founded G-Unity Foundation Inc. (often called simply G-Unity), a public foundation that provides grants to nonprofit organizations that focus on improving the quality of life for low-income and under served communities.

==Controversies==
===Ja Rule===
Before signing with Interscope Records, 50 Cent had been in disputes with rapper Ja Rule and his label Murder Inc. Records. 50 Cent said that the feud began in 1999 after Ja Rule spotted him with a man who took his chain. However, Ja Rule said the conflict stemmed from a video shoot in Queens because 50 Cent did not like Ja Rule &quot;getting so much love&quot; from the neighborhood. A confrontation occurred in a New York studio where rapper Black Child, a Murder Inc. artist, stabbed 50 Cent, which resulted in him having four stitches.

Although it seemed that the feud was over, Ja Rule returned with a track entitled &quot;21 Gunz&quot;. In response, Lloyd Banks and 50 Cent released the track &quot;Return of Ja Fool&quot; on Lloyd Banks&#x27; mixtape &quot;Mo Money in the Bank Pt. 4, Gang Green Season Starts Now&quot;.

In an interview with MTV, Ja Rule has stated that his new album, &quot;The Mirror&quot;, will not be continuing any past feuds that he has engaged in. He said: 
===The Game===
In early 2005, a feud between The Game and G-Unit began. Even before The Game&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Documentary&quot;, was released and their feud became public, there was tension between The Game and 50 Cent. Soon after &quot;The Documentary&quot;″s release, 50 Cent felt that the rapper was disloyal for saying he did not want to participate in G-Unit&#x27;s feud with other rappers, and even wanting to work with artists with whom G-Unit were feuding, such as Nas and Jadakiss.

50 Cent also said that he was not getting his proper credit for the creation of the album. He also said that he wrote five of the songs, but The Game denied that. During that dispute, The Game confronted 50 Cent at the Hot 97 studio in New York City and members of The Game&#x27;s entourage began shooting at 50 Cent and other members of the G-unit entourage, causing them to flee the building and causing Hot 97 radio security to shoot a member of The Game&#x27;s entourage. After the situation between them escalated, 50 Cent and The Game held a press conference to announce their reconciliation. Fans had mixed feelings as to whether the rappers created a publicity stunt to boost the sales of the two albums the pair had just released. Nevertheless, even after the situation had apparently deflated, G-Unit continued to feud with The Game who responded during a performance at Summer Jam and launched a boycott of G-Unit called &quot;G-Unot&quot;.

After the performance at Summer Jam, The Game responded with &quot;300 Bars and Runnin&#x27;&quot;, an extended track aimed at G-Unit as well as members of Roc-A-Fella Records on the mixtape &quot;You Know What It Is Vol. 3&quot;. 50 Cent responded through his &quot;Piggy Bank&quot; music video, which features The Game as a Mr. Potato Head doll and also parodies other rivals. Since then both groups continued to attack each other. The Game released two more mixtapes, &quot;Ghost Unit&quot; and a mixtape/DVD called &quot;Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin&quot;.

50 Cent&#x27;s rebuttal was &quot;Not Rich, Still Lyin&#x27;&quot; where he mocks The Game. In addition, G-Unit started to respond on numerous mixtapes and new G-Unit Records artist Spider Loc began insulting The Game in various songs. The Game responded with &quot;240 Bars (Spider Joke)&quot;, a song mainly aimed at Spider Loc, but also addressing Tony Yayo and rap group M.O.P., and on the song 100 Bars (The Funeral).

The feud seemed to have gained steam after Tony Yayo allegedly slapped the fourteen-year-old son of Czar Entertainment CEO, Jimmy Henchman. The Game responded with &quot;Body Bags&quot; on his mixtape, &quot;You Know What It Is Vol. 4&quot;. G-Unit have released a song named &quot;We on Some Shit &quot; which is aimed at Czar Entertainment as well as Cam&#x27;ron and Fat Joe. In June 2010 Game expressed that he would not object to a G-Unit reunion. After the G-Unit reunion idea circulated around the internet a Facebook group was launched to help encourage the G-Unit comeback. In late 2016, the two ended their long standing feud.

===Fat Joe===

50 Cent pointed out that Fat Joe painted a target on himself for partnering up with Ja Rule on the song &quot;New York&quot;. 50 Cent recorded the track &quot;Piggy Bank&quot;, in which he attacked Fat Joe. Fat Joe responded with a track entitled &quot;My Fofo&quot; and although he said that he would not respond in songs after this, he made one more track, &quot;Victim&quot; which 50 Cent is purportedly the subject of as well as a guest appearance on Rick Ross&#x27; Mafia Music remix. 50 Cent and Tony Yayo took more shots at him on &quot;I Run NY&quot;.

Even though things died down, at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, Fat Joe mentioned that all of the police presence in the venue was &quot;courtesy of G-Unit&quot; which related to his lyrical accusations that 50 Cent was a &quot;snitch&quot;. 50 Cent and Tony Yayo retaliated on set later in the show at the end of their performance by shouting obscenities towards Fat Joe and Terror Squad, which were censored by MTV. Tony Yayo said Fat Joe ran from them at the VMAs.

When asked about the 50 Cent and G-Unit situation in an interview Fat Joe said he will no longer be responding and that he has left it to his close friend Pistol Pete and his crew Kill All Rats (K.A.R) to handle. Pistol Pete appeared on The Game&#x27;s &quot;Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin&quot; DVD and disrespected Tony Yayo, Chris Lighty (owner of Violator Records who had ties with 50 Cent), and James Cruz (50 Cent&#x27;s manager) and said he chased Tony Yayo near a jewelry store. Lloyd Banks, Spider Loc, and Young Buck have also been insulted by Fat Joe.

In 2007, the feud was continued in interviews and by affiliates from both parties. In 2008, the beef boiled over when 50 Cent released a mixtape entitled &quot;Elephant In the Sand&quot;, which is a mock title of Fat Joe&#x27;s album &quot;The Elephant in the Room&quot;. The front and back covers contain photos of Fat Joe on a beach. In response Fat Joe and his group K.A.R. released a mixtape titled &quot;Gay-Unit&quot; hosted by Fat Joe himself.

The feud between 50 Cent and Fat Joe ended in 2012 when 50 Cent approached Fat Joe&#x27;s trailer at the BET Awards where he was confronted by Fat Joe&#x27;s entourage he told them he wanted to make peace out of respect for Chris Lighty, however Fat Joe was unsure of his intentions until later that day when they shook hands while appearing on stage together amongst other past and present Violator artists at the BET Awards segment that paid tribute to the label&#x27;s founder Chris Lighty who died that year.

In 2014 Fat Joe gave a track titled &quot;Free&quot; to DJ Kay Slay to use as he was working on his final album and told him he can do whatever he wants with it. In light of the 2012 BET Awards Kay Slay decided to get 50 Cent to do a verse for it and put his on his mixtape &quot;The Rise Of A City&quot;. Although Fat Joe was unaware Kay Slay was putting 50 Cent on his track he approved stating unity is good for hip-hop.
That same year, Tony Yayo shouted out Fat Joe, saying that there was &quot;no beef&quot;.

===Cam&#x27;ron===
A feud between 50 Cent and Cam&#x27;ron began when 50 Cent was on Hot 97 giving an interview and Cam&#x27;ron called in. Cam’ron asked 50 Cent whether he had the power to stop records from being released on Koch Records and 50 Cent said that he does in some respects. As the conversation escalated into an argument, 50 Cent called Koch Records the &quot;industry graveyard&quot;. Cam&#x27;ron pointed out that Jim Jones&#x27; newest album sold just as much as Lloyd Banks&#x27; album did, despite the fact that Dipset is on an independent label while G-Unit is on a major label. 50 Cent took offense to this and said that Lloyd Banks has more money than Lil Wayne and Jim Jones, which makes record sales irrelevant. Cam&#x27;ron became upset and rebutted 50 Cent&#x27;s statements. Most notably, he brought up the poor record sales of the Mobb Deep album, &quot;Blood Money&quot;. Eventually the debate became so heated that the radio station was forced to end the call.

<doc id="573113" wikidata="Q2313920" url="?curid=573113" title="Cressida">
<text>Cressida (; also Criseida, Cresseid or Criseyde) is a character who appears in many Medieval and Renaissance retellings of the story of the Trojan War. She is a Trojan woman, the daughter of Calchas, a Greek seer. She falls in love with Troilus, the youngest son of King Priam, and pledges everlasting love, but when she is sent to the Greeks as part of a hostage exchange, she forms a liaison with the Greek warrior Diomedes. In later culture she becomes an archetype of a faithless lover.

==Character history==

The character&#x27;s name is derived from that of Chryseis, a character who appears in the &quot;Iliad&quot; but has no connection with Troilus, Diomedes or Calchas. Indeed, the story of Troilus and Cressida does not appear in any Greek legends but was invented by the twelfth century French poet Benoît de Sainte-Maure in the &quot;Roman de Troie&quot;. The woman in the love triangle is here called not Cressida but Briseida, a name derived from that of Briseis, a different character in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, who again is neither related to Calchas nor involved in any love affairs with Troilus or Diomedes. Initially, after the &quot;Roman&quot; appeared, other authors who refer to the story, for example, Azalais d&#x27;Altier in her poem &quot;Tanz salutz e tantas amors&quot; and Guido delle Colonne in his &quot;Historia destructionis Troiae&quot;, continue to use names derived from that of Briseis.

It is the Italian author and poet Boccaccio who makes the decisive shift in the character&#x27;s name in &quot;Il Filostrato&quot;. This poem is the first work dedicated to telling the story of the love triangle rather than to the larger tale of the Trojan War. Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; is an expanded version of the story based on Boccaccio. Several other authors then took up the tale, including the Scottish poet Robert Henryson in his &quot;The Testament of Cresseid&quot;, which &#x27;completes&#x27; Cressida&#x27;s story (left unfinished by Chaucer), and William Shakespeare in his play of the Trojan War, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;.

Cressida has most often been depicted by writers as &quot;false Cressida&quot;, a paragon of female inconstancy. As soon as she has betrayed Troilus, she has fulfilled her purpose and the men who have written about her do not mention her again. Such is the case in Benoît, Guido, Boccaccio, Chaucer and Shakespeare. Chaucer&#x27;s poem, however, at least portrays a more sympathetic Criseyde showing a self-conscious awareness of her literary status: &quot;Alas, of me until the world&#x27;s end shall be wrote no good song&quot;. Henryson&#x27;s treatment is unusual in that he looks at events after the end of the traditional tale. His poem takes up the repentant Cresseid&#x27;s story after she has been abandoned by Diomedes and developed leprosy.

Some authors have attempted to exonerate the character by having her choose Troilus over Diomedes. Such is the case in John Dryden&#x27;s rewriting of Shakespeare in an attempt at that heap of Rubbish, under which many excellent thoughts lay bury&#x27;d&quot;. William Walton and Christopher Hassall&#x27;s 1954 opera &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; did likewise. In both of these cases, Cressida&#x27;s being true to Troilus is associated with her death as part of the concluding tragic events.

Other modern fiction has introduced further departures from the traditional narrative. Jack Lindsay&#x27;s novel &quot;Cressida&#x27;s First Lover: A Tale of Ancient Greece&quot; explores another area untouched in standard narratives, some of her earlier life.

==Shakespeare==
In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, we first hear of Cressida in Act 1 Scene 1. Pandarus and Troilus are discussing how the latter&#x27;s unspoken love for the former&#x27;s niece, Cressida, is preventing him from performing on the battlefield. She first appears in person in the following scene, speaking to her manservant before Pandarus enters. They commence into witty banter while a parade of Trojan soldiers heads past. When Troilus walks by Pandarus tries to convince Cressida of his merit, but she teases him, saying she has heard Achilles, a Grecian warrior, is far more impressive. Once Pandarus exits Cressida admits in a soliloquy that she does in fact love Troilus, but is worried about publicising it. In her own words:

She next appears in Act 3 Scene 2, when Pandarus leads her on stage wearing a veil to meet with Troilus. Pandarus then heads back &quot;inside&quot; and the two are left alone. Cressida struggles to practise her maxim as planned while Troilus professes his love for her. When Pandarus re-enters she eventually admits her own reciprocal love of Troilus. In a confused speech she battles with her own fate as a woman, even speaking in a collective woman&#x27;s voice, revealing a greater intelligence than the male characters give her credit for:

Cressida becomes increasingly affected by her own qualities, saying &#x27;I show more craft than love&#x27; (line 124). She begs to be allowed to leave, but Troilus and Pandarus want her to stay, so that they can marry to immediate effect. She seems to prophesise her own failings, repeating the word &#x27;false&#x27; seven times before Pandarus &#x27;seals&#x27; the match. In Act 4 Scene 2 we see the couple on the morning after their first night together. They are euphoric, but Cressida does not want Troilus to leave her, showing an awareness of her own vulnerability in that moment. On line 20, she says &#x27;you men will never tarry&#x27; as he begins to contemplate leaving. Pandarus enters and cracks some jokes about how she had now lost her innocence, and Cressida is flustered. Once Troilus and Cressida are dressed, Aeneas visits in a panic to say that for the return of one of Troy&#x27;s men from the Greeks, Antenor, they must trade Cressida over to Diomedes, a Greek general. Cressida becomes an object to trade, and Troilus does nothing to prevent the sad event, though he is miserable for it. In Act 4 Scene 4 Cressida is informed of the plans to trade her to the Greeks. Troilus gives her his sleeve as a love token and she gives him a glove. Their relationship becomes an inversion of Paris and Helen&#x27;s. Diomedes enters and Cressida is handed over.

In the following scene we again see Cressida in a less vulnerable state. Although she is now being led through the Greek encampment by Diomedes, surrounded by men, she engages with the men, Ulysses in particular, with defensive banter. Ulysses predicts her behaviour using coarse phrases such as &quot;sluttish spoils&quot;. Act 5 Scene 2 is the most poignant scene containing Cressida, and the most memorable. Troilus has crept into the camp and is accompanied by Ulysses, and they are watch the scene unfolding between Diomedes and Cressida unnoticed. Thersites is also present and unseen, the clown of dark humour making distasteful comments exaggerating the sexual inference of what he sees. Cressida flirts with Diomedes, yet is occasionally struck by guilt. She appears to lust after him, even giving him Troilus&#x27;s sleeve as a love token, though quickly tries to retrieve it from him in a struggle, offering her own body in trade. Diomedes insists he will have both. He exits, having planned a return visit. Troilus is mad with jealousy and anger throughout the scene, but she never realises he is close by. Her final lines of the play are:

Later, we are told of things that concern her: for example, the letter Troilus receives which he tears up, and Troilus&#x27; horse which Diomedes sends to her as a prize after knocking him out of the saddle in battle.

In All&#x27;s well that ends well act 2 scene 1 line 97 Lafew says: I am Cressida&#x27;s uncle that dare leave two together i.e. the king and Helena who has come to cure him. Cressida&#x27;s uncle serves as a go-between for Cressida and Troilus.

===Contemporary criticism===
&quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; has little performance history prior to the 20th century. Cressida&#x27;s character is as isolated from framing as the rest of the story—we never know how her life ends, there is no &quot;ever after&quot; for her, and even her beginning is mysterious to us. She appears a witty young girl, only to become a serious, thoughtful, and thought-provoking woman in moments of reflection. Carol Rutter explores the reasons why Cressida is so fascinating. She writes &quot;[...] the challenge Shakespeare constructs for this play is to put before us a Cressida, who, like the fair (but dark) lady of the sonnets is, in Eve Sedgwick&#x27;s memorable term, &#x27;oxymoron militant&#x27;, a genuine contradiction.&quot;

Rutter has much to say on Cressida&#x27;s self-awareness. Firstly, that Cressida is unique, that she &quot;is something entirely, radically new, the woman who behaves like a man, who betrays the man,&quot; secondly, that, &quot;two voices seem to be speaking [...] Where has Cressida learnt this &#x27;instruction&#x27;? [...] the speech is neurotic, pragmatic, anti-romantic – yet its form is a sonnet [...] it discloses strategic schizophrenia [...] by this agenda, to win at love, a woman must play false, act double. She must separate instinct from sexual performance [...]&quot;.

Juliet Stevenson commented in Rutter&#x27;s book &quot;Clamorous Voices&quot; that such roles inspire an actor to &quot;react against the way tradition and prejudice have stigmatised them – Cressida the whore [...] every time they&#x27;re judged you feel protective. Perhaps too protective. So you might end up playing a Cressida who is above reproach.&quot;

The main question as regards Shakespeare&#x27;s Cressida is centralised around whether she is simply a &quot;whore&quot;, or if she is more complex, and worth further attention due to her obvious intelligence and duality.

== In popular culture ==

In &quot;The Myth Makers&quot;, a 1965 storyline by Donald Cotton in the time-travel–based British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the character Vicki (played by Maureen O&#x27;Brien), a teenaged travelling companion of the Doctor, meets Priam, King of Troy who, disliking her name, dubs her Cressida. During the course of the story, Vicki/Cressida falls in love with Priam&#x27;s son Troilus, and after the fall of Troy elects to stay with Troilus and rebuild the city. The story inverts the traditional fates of Troilus and Cressida, a change made to facilitate the departure of the Vicki character (and actress O&#x27;Brien) from the series.

The name &quot;Cressida&quot; is sometimes given, as a literary allusion, as a first name to faithless characters. In his 1969 novel &quot;Clean Straw for Nothing&quot; George Johnston&#x27;s wife Charmian Clift is the basis for the character Cressida Morley; academics Paul Genoni and Tanya Dalziell suggest in their 2018 book &quot;Half the Perfect World&quot; that it was the impending publication of Johnston&#x27;s novel, which Clift knew would lay bare her infidelities whilst on the island of Hydra, which prompted her to suicide in 1969. In the 2005 movie &quot;Hitch&quot;, a flashback scene shows the character of Cressida Baylor (played by Robinne Lee) betray the fidelity of the main character Hitch (played by Will Smith), thus negatively affecting his judgement and attitude toward love and women.

The progressive rock band Cressida is named after the character.

The Toyota Cressida, a mid-size car manufactured until 1992, was named after the character.

<doc id="573128" wikidata="Q7369880" url="?curid=573128" title="Rosslyn, Virginia">
<text>Rosslyn ( ) is a heavily urbanized unincorporated area in Northern Virginia located in the northeastern corner of Arlington County, Virginia, north of Arlington National Cemetery and directly across the Potomac River from Georgetown and Foggy Bottom in Washington, D.C.

Rosslyn encompasses the Arlington neighborhoods of North Rosslyn and Radnor/Ft. Myer Heights, and is located east of Court House, another urbanized Arlington neighborhood. Characterized as one of several &quot;urban villages&quot; by the county, the numerous skyscrapers in the dense business section of Rosslyn make its appearance in some ways more urban than nearby Washington. Rosslyn residents have an average household income of $105,000 and 81% are college graduates.

Establishments in the neighborhood include Sinclair Broadcast Group-owned ABC affiliate WJLA located in the Rosslyn Twin Towers, and Marriott International&#x27;s longest operating hotel, the former Key Bridge Marriott. Notable structures include the United States Marine Corps War Memorial, and the Netherlands Carillon and Freedom Park offer views of the Washington Monument and other Washington landmarks.

== History==


During Virginia&#x27;s colonial period, Rosslyn&#x27;s shoreline included a landing for Awbrey&#x27;s ferry, which transported travelers to and from Georgetown. A community that gradually developed behind the shore became known as &quot;Ross Lynn&quot;, the name of a local farm owned by William and Carolyn Ross.

===19th century===
During the 1830s and 1840s, the Aqueduct Bridge was constructed between Georgetown and Rosslyn. When completed in 1843, this bridge carried the Alexandria Canal, which transported canal boats from the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in Georgetown to the downstream port of Alexandria, Virginia.

Following the American Civil War in the 1860s, a lawless community developed at the base of the bridge. Known primarily for its gambling halls, pawnshops, saloons, brothels and unsavory inhabitants, the community failed to attract much development other than the Arlington Brewery, which became a Cherry Smash soft drink bottling plant after Prohibition went into effect. Eventually, spurred by the real estate potential that the arrival of electric trolleys in the 1890s inspired, developers and reformers ousted Rosslyn&#x27;s more unsavory elements in the early 20th century. They organized under the name &quot;Good Citizen&#x27;s League&quot; and nominated Captain Crandal Mackey as the Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney to fight corruption. Mackey, after being unsuccessfully challenged by the incumbent on legal grounds, won the election by two votes. When the sheriff did not execute Mackey&#x27;s orders to clean up in Rosslyn, Mackey organized a group of thirty citizens to raid and destroy the saloons and gambling houses. This expedition took place of 30 May 1904.

The area around Rosslyn remained dangerous, especially at night on the Falls Church Turnpike, now U.S. Route 29, Langston Boulevard. A short way past Rosslyn heading west was Dead Man&#x27;s Hollow, near today&#x27;s intersection with Spout Run. The name came from the occasional gruesome murders as the result of robberies.

===20th century===
In 1923, the Aqueduct Bridge connecting Rosslyn to Georgetown was replaced by the Francis Scott Key Memorial Bridge.
In 1964, the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge opened to carry Interstate 66 (I-66) between Washington, D.C., and Rosslyn. Soon afterwards, a development boom in the 1960s began to revitalize Rosslyn with the construction of a large number of high-rise office buildings and hotels in its center and a smaller number of residential buildings on its outskirts. Arlington County widened Rosslyn&#x27;s major streets to accommodate the increased motor vehicle traffic that this new development would bring. A skywalk system carried pedestrian traffic over these widened streets. While planners expected retail establishments to develop along the skywalks, few such establishments actually opened. As a result, the skywalk system attracted few pedestrians. The Arlington County government has since announced plans to dismantle some or all of the bridges that carry the skywalks over Rosslyn&#x27;s broad streets.

During the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s, &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (W. Mark Felt) passed information to &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Bob Woodward in the middle of the night in an underground parking garage at 1401 Wilson Boulevard in Rosslyn.

In 1977, Metrorail&#x27;s Blue Line reached Rosslyn. In subsequent years, the Blue Line and the Orange Line were extended from an underground junction near the Rosslyn station to serve Northern Virginia&#x27;s suburbs. In the early 1980s, I-66 was extended through Rosslyn to reach the Capital Beltway. The extensions of Metrorail and I-66 attracted additional high-rise development to Rosslyn.

===21st century===
In 2003, the Virginia Baseball Stadium Authority attempted to attract the relocating Montréal Expos to Northern Virginia by proposing three Arlington County locations for a new baseball stadium. Two sites were in the urban village of Pentagon City; the third was a site in the southeastern corner of Rosslyn that was already occupied by four cooperative buildings, formerly the historic &quot;Arlington Towers&quot;, which were the first high-rise towers in Arlington County, now known as River Place. The issue proved highly divisive, and Virginia&#x27;s bid failed when Virginia Governor Mark Warner ruled out state financing for stadium construction. The Expos moved to D.C. after the 2004 season to become the Washington Nationals, with a new stadium built in southeast Washington.

In 2013, the Georgetown Business Improvement District proposed a gondola lift between Georgetown and Rosslyn as an alternative to placing a Metro stop at Georgetown in its 2013-2028 economic plans. Washington, D.C., and Arlington County have been conducting feasibility studies for it since 2016.

==Economy==
The original corporate headquarters of &quot;USA Today&quot;, owned by the Gannett Company, was located in Rosslyn. Both the company and the newspaper occupied two high-rise silver-colored towers, built in the early 1980s, which adjoin each other at 1000 and 1100 Wilson Boulevard. Gannett did not own these buildings, and moved from their original home to a new campus in Fairfax County, Virginia, in 2002. In the same year, the ABC-affiliate in Washington, D.C., WJLA-TV, &quot;ABC 7&quot;, moved their main studios into the space in Rosslyn previously occupied by &quot;USA Today.&quot;

Federal agencies based in Rosslyn include the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. The Department of State has several office locations in Rosslyn.

Nonprofits based in Rosslyn include the American Institute in Taiwan.

As of 2010, Rosslyn has of office space and 6,365 housing units. Some of the tallest condominium buildings in the Washington metropolitan area are located in Rosslyn, including Waterview tower, River Place, and Turnberry tower.

Construction of 1812 N Moore in Rosslyn began in 2010, and in late 2013 it became the tallest building in the Washington metropolitan area. In 2017, the international food and beverage company Nestlé S.A. announced that it would move its U.S. corporate headquarters from California to this building.

In order to make the area more walkable, Rosslyn&#x27;s elevated walkways and other urban peculiarities are planned to be demolished or modified, along with lanes being removed or reversed.

== Arts and culture ==
===Annual cultural events===
The Arlington County Government operates the 367-seat Rosslyn Spectrum Theater. Five annual film festivals are held in Rosslyn. The Washington D.C. Independent Film Festival runs for nearly two weeks in March showing independent films from around the world in various locations in and around Washington, DC. In 2011 Rosslyn hosted over 30 film screenings as well as classes, seminars and workshops led by industry professionals.

The Annual NoVa International Jewish Film Festival is held each spring in Rosslyn and other Virginia locations. The Rosslyn Outdoor Film Festival runs in the spring and summer months showing popular films for free in Gateway Park Friday evenings at dusk. Slapsticon is a four-day film festival in July that features silent films, occasionally accompanied by live musicians, as well as early films with audio tracks. The Rosebud Film &amp; Video Festival is an all day event in November that features original works by regional film and video makers. The Rosslyn Jazz Festival, started in 1991, attracted 10,000 attendees in 2006. The annual US FreedomWalk Festival, started in 2000, draws walkers from around the world each Fall for a weekend of walks in Rosslyn and nearby areas.

===Education===

Rosslyn is part of Arlington Public School, the public school district for Arlington County, Virginia.

The Art Institute of Washington is located at North Fort Myer Drive. Rosslyn is a location for some of the University of Virginia&#x27;s business programs, including McIntire School of Commerce Master of Science in the Management of Information Technology at the Waterview Conference Center, and Darden School of Business Master of Business Administration&#x27;s Executive/Global Executive at the Rosslyn Twin Towers.

===Museums and other points of interest===
The Marine Corps War Memorial in Rosslyn is visited by over one million annually. Among these visitors are audiences for the Sunset Parades performed Tuesday evenings during the summer months by the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps with the Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon. Crowds also gather at the Memorial on the 4th of July to watch the national fireworks display.

The Netherlands Carillon in Rosslyn is a set of 50 bells housed in a 12-story tower between Arlington National Cemetery and the Marine Corps War Memorial. The carillon is a gift from the Netherlands to the US in recognition of support received during World War II. Originally installed with 49 bells, a 50th was added by the Netherlands in 1995 on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands. Each spring the grounds are planted with thousands of tulips imported from the Netherlands. During the summer months carilloneurs play concerts on the bells using a keyboard located in the tower. The tower is occasionally open to the public and offers views of the national monuments in Washington, DC, the Marine Corps War Memorial, and Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="573135" wikidata="Q15644" url="?curid=573135" title="Portia (moon)">
<text>Portia is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 1. The moon is named after Portia, the heroine of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. It is also designated Uranus XII.

Portia is the second-largest inner satellite of Uranus after Puck. The Portian orbit, which lies inside Uranus&#x27;s synchronous orbital radius, is slowly decaying due to tidal deceleration. The moon will one day either break up into a planetary ring or hit Uranus.

It is the namesake of a group of satellites called the Portia group, which includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda, and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties.

Little is known about Portia beyond its dimensions of about 156 × 126 km, orbit, and geometric albedo of about 0.08.

In &quot;Voyager 2&quot; imagery, Portia appears as an elongated object whose major axis points towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of the Portia&#x27;s prolate spheroid is 0.8 ± 0.1. Its surface is grey in color. Observations with Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water ice absorption features in the spectrum of Portia. Observations with James Webb Space Telescope have also found evidence for water ice or hydrated minerals on Portia&#x27;s surface, and have also confirmed that Portia group members Juliet, Belinda, and Cressida have roughly similar spectra to Portia.
