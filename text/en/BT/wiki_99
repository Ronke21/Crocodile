<text>In mathematics, more specifically in group theory, a group is said to be perfect if it equals its own commutator subgroup, or equivalently, if the group has no non-trivial abelian quotients.

== Examples ==
The smallest (non-trivial) perfect group is the alternating group &quot;A&quot;5. More generally, any non-abelian simple group is perfect since the commutator subgroup is a normal subgroup with abelian quotient. However, a perfect group need not be simple; for example, the special linear group over the field with 5 elements, SL(2,5) (or the binary icosahedral group, which is isomorphic to it) is perfect but not simple (it has a non-trivial center containing formula_1).

The direct product of any two simple non-abelian groups is perfect but not simple; the commutator of two elements is [(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;),(&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;)] = ([&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;],[&quot;b&quot;,&quot;d&quot;]). Since commutators in each simple group form a generating set, pairs of commutators form a generating set of the direct product.

The fundamental group of formula_2 is a perfect group of order 120.

More generally, a quasisimple group (a perfect central extension of a simple group) that is a non-trivial extension (and therefore not a simple group itself) is perfect but not simple; this includes all the insoluble non-simple finite special linear groups SL(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) as extensions of the projective special linear group PSL(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) (SL(2,5) is an extension of PSL(2,5), which is isomorphic to &quot;A&quot;5). Similarly, the special linear group over the real and complex numbers is perfect, but the general linear group GL is never perfect (except when trivial or over formula_3, where it equals the special linear group), as the determinant gives a non-trivial abelianization and indeed the commutator subgroup is SL.

A non-trivial perfect group, however, is necessarily not solvable; and 4 divides its order (if finite), moreover, if 8 does not divide the order, then 3 does.

Every acyclic group is perfect, but the converse is not true: &quot;A&quot;5 is perfect but not acyclic (in fact, not even superperfect), see . In fact, for formula_4 the alternating group formula_5 is perfect but not superperfect, with formula_6 for formula_7.

Any quotient of a perfect group is perfect. A non-trivial finite perfect group that is not simple must then be an extension of at least one smaller simple non-abelian group. But it can be the extension of more than one simple group. In fact, the direct product of perfect groups is also perfect.

Every perfect group &quot;G&quot; determines another perfect group &quot;E&quot; (its universal central extension) together with a surjection &quot;f&quot;: &quot;E&quot; → &quot;G&quot; whose kernel is in the center of &quot;E,&quot;
such that &quot;f&quot; is universal with this property. The kernel of &quot;f&quot; is called the Schur multiplier of &quot;G&quot; because it was first studied by Issai Schur in 1904; it is isomorphic to the homology group formula_8.

In the plus construction of algebraic K-theory, if we consider the group formula_9 for a commutative ring formula_10, then the subgroup of elementary matrices formula_11 forms a perfect subgroup.

== Ore&#x27;s conjecture ==
As the commutator subgroup is &quot;generated&quot; by commutators, a perfect group may contain elements that are products of commutators but not themselves commutators. Øystein Ore proved in 1951 that the alternating groups on five or more elements contained only commutators, and conjectured that this was so for all the finite non-abelian simple groups. Ore&#x27;s conjecture was finally proven in 2008. The proof relies on the classification theorem.

==Grün&#x27;s lemma==
A basic fact about perfect groups is Otto Grün&#x27;s proposition of Grün&#x27;s lemma : the quotient of a perfect group by its center is centerless (has trivial center).

Proof: If &quot;G&quot; is a perfect group, let &quot;Z&quot;1 and &quot;Z&quot;2 denote the first two terms of the upper central series of &quot;G&quot; (i.e., &quot;Z&quot;1 is the center of &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;2/&quot;Z&quot;1 is the center of &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;1). If &quot;H&quot; and &quot;K&quot; are subgroups of &quot;G&quot;, denote the commutator of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;K&quot; by [&quot;H&quot;, &quot;K&quot;] and note that [&quot;Z&quot;1, &quot;G&quot;] = 1 and [&quot;Z&quot;2, &quot;G&quot;] ⊆ &quot;Z&quot;1, and consequently (the convention that [&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;] = [[&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;], &quot;Z&quot;] is followed):

:formula_12
:formula_13

By the [[three subgroups lemma]] (or equivalently, by the [[Commutator#Identities (group theory)|Hall-Witt identity]]), it follows that [&quot;G&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;2] = [[&quot;G&quot;, &quot;G&quot;], &quot;Z&quot;2] = [&quot;G&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;2] = {1}. Therefore, &quot;Z&quot;2 ⊆ &quot;Z&quot;1 = &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), and the center of the quotient group &quot;G&quot; / &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the [[trivial group]].

As a consequence, all [[Center (group theory)#Higher centers|higher centers]] (that is, higher terms in the [[upper central series]]) of a perfect group equal the center.

==Group homology==
In terms of [[group homology]], a perfect group is precisely one whose first homology group vanishes: &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;, Z) = 0, as the first homology group of a group is exactly the abelianization of the group, and perfect means trivial abelianization. An advantage of this definition is that it admits strengthening:
* A [[superperfect group]] is one whose first two homology groups vanish: formula_14.
* An [[acyclic group]] is one &quot;all&quot; of whose (reduced) homology groups vanish formula_15 (This is equivalent to all homology groups other than formula_16 vanishing.)

==Quasi-perfect group==
Especially in the field of [[algebraic K-theory]], a group is said to be quasi-perfect if its commutator subgroup is perfect; in symbols, a quasi-perfect group is one such that &quot;G&quot;(1) = &quot;G&quot;(2) (the commutator of the commutator subgroup is the commutator subgroup), while a perfect group is one such that &quot;G&quot;(1) = &quot;G&quot; (the commutator subgroup is the whole group).

<text>Pennywise is the debut studio album by the American punk rock band Pennywise, released on Epitaph Records in 1991.

==Writing and production==
Writing for the first Pennywise album began around 1989/1990. The band recorded it in 1991 at Westbeach Recorders in Hollywood, California. Epitaph owner/founder Brett Gurewitz actually produced the album. However, constant disagreements with guitarist Fletcher over the album&#x27;s production and his dislike of the sound of the album prompted him to have his name taken off the credits in the liner notes.

==Reception==

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote: &quot;As a skatepunk answer to Bad Religion, Pennywise&#x27;s eponymous debut weds driving, warp-speed punk-rock to intelligent, positive-thinking lyrics. The clean production, tight vocal harmonies and crisp ensemble playing provide a fine showcase for the Hermosa Beach, California band&#x27;s high-energy odes to self-reliance and camaraderie.&quot;

<doc id="585278" wikidata="Q149121" url="?curid=585278" title="Lobata">
<text>Lobata is an order of transparent marine invertebrates belonging to the phylum of Ctenophora in the class Tentaculata, and are commonly referred to as comb jellies or sea gooseberries. There are currently 19 extant known species in the order of Lobata. Members of Lobata exhibit a compressed body in the vertical plane and a pair of oral lobes. They are known to inhabit marine pelagic surfaces and the marine shores.

==Anatomy==
The lobates have a pair of lobes, which are muscular, cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes on either side of the mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.

Lobates have eight comb-rows, originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes; in species with (four) auricles, the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows. Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water, using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion, although &quot;Leucothea&quot; has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion. Members of the lobate genera &quot;Bathocyroe&quot; and &quot;Ocyropsis&quot; can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly.

Unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates&#x27; combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, and combs on the same row beat together rather than in Mexican wave style. This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg-like.

== Reproduction ==
Most members of Lobata exhibit hermaphroditism, where the individual carries both male and female sexual organs. Each comb jelly will release roughly 8,000 eggs during spawning, which occurs during the night when the temperature reaches between . Thirteen days after spawning, young Comb jellies will have grown to a size in which they can release eggs and sperm daily. 

== Feeding ==
Members of Lobata are carnivores and are major predators of planktonic organisms such as copepods and fish larvae. By continuously pumping water into its body cavity, comb jellies are able to trap small prey on adhesive cells, known as colloblast, which are found on the tentacles and on the underside of their lobes.

<doc id="585295" wikidata="Q4915729" url="?curid=585295" title="Birchfield Harriers">
<text>Birchfield Harriers is an athletics club, founded in 1877. Its home is at Birmingham&#x27;s Alexander Stadium, England.

As well as welcoming recreational runners they cater for all levels of experience up to and including Olympic athletes whether able-bodied or wheelchair-using athletes.

The Club&#x27;s motto is &quot;Fleet and Free&quot;.

== History ==

The Harriers were named after the Birchfield district of Birmingham. Their previous home (from 1929 to 1977), at nearby Perry Barr, was Alexander Sports Ground. It still carries their badge, a running stag, rendered in this case in Art Deco style, carved in 1929 and attributed to William Bloye. Both venues were named for members of the Alexander family, who were prominent members of the club.

Tom McCook, a former athlete and club chairman, was the club&#x27;s President from 2001 until standing down at the end of 2013.

==Honours==
*800m and relay runner Pat Cropper was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for her running achievements.
*In the 2000 New Year Honours, heptathlete Denise Lewis was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).
*Coach Norma Blaine was made an MBE in the New Years Honours announced on 31 December 2010, for her services to athletics.

<text>A return merchandise authorization (RMA), return authorization (RA) or return goods authorization (RGA) is a part of the process of returning a product to receive a refund, replacement, or repair to which buyer and seller agree during the product&#x27;s warranty period.

== Reverse logistics ==
The issuance of an RMA/RGA is a key gatekeeping point in the reverse logistics cycle, providing the vendor with a final opportunity to diagnose and correct the customer&#x27;s problem with the product. The reasons for a product return vary and include improper installation by the customer or inability to configure the product. RMA/RGA comes before the customer permanently relinquishes ownership of the product to the manufacturer, commonly referred to as a return. A return is costly for the vendor and inconvenient for the customer; any return that can be prevented benefits both parties.

Returned merchandise requires management by the manufacturer after the return. The product has a second life cycle after the return. An important aspect of RMA management is learning from RMA trends to prevent further returns. Depending on what the rules are, the manufacturer may send the customer an advance replacement. RMAs may be minimized in a number of ways. Adding a customer survey capability may prevent RMAs by detecting problems in advance of returns.

Returns are sometimes minimized by reducing transaction errors prior to the merchandise leaving the seller. Providing additional information to consumers also reduces returns.

== Return to vendor ==
Return to vendor (RTV) is the process where goods are returned to the original vendor instead of the distributor. In many cases the RTV was originally returned to the seller by the end consumer. While RTV transactions usually occur between the seller and the vendor, in some instances the end consumer returns the product directly to the vendor, sidestepping the distributor.

<doc id="585303" wikidata="Q239558" url="?curid=585303" title="Jane Leeves">
<text>Jane Elizabeth Leeves (born 18 April 1961) is an English actress, best known for her role as Daphne Moon on the NBC sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; (1993–2004), for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 50th Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 52nd Golden Globe Awards. She also played Joy Scroggs on TV Land&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;.

Leeves made her screen debut with a small role in 1983 on the British television comedy programme &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, and appeared as a dancer in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot;. She moved to the United States, where she performed in small roles. From 1986 to 1988, she played her first leading character in the sitcom &quot;Throb&quot;, then secured brief recurring parts in the sitcoms &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. She was cast in films such as &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1994), &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1996), &quot;Music of the Heart&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Event&quot; (2003). In 2018, she began appearing in the Fox medical drama &quot;The Resident&quot;.

== Career ==

The daughter of an engineer and a nurse, Jane Leeves was born in Ilford, Essex, England. She was raised in East Grinstead, Sussex, along with two sisters and a brother.
She was a regular on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, in the dance troupe Hill&#x27;s Angels. She made use of her experience as a dancer in a scene in the 1983 film &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot;. In the US, she appeared as a tourist with a baby in the video for David Lee Roth&#x27;s song &quot;California Girls&quot;, but struggled for several years to establish an acting career. She had a role as Serena, a lesbian avant-garde dancer, the girlfriend of the girlfriend of Willem Dafoe&#x27;s character Eric Masters, in the 1985 film &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;.

During this period, Leeves was cast as Holly for the pilot of the US version of the science-fiction comedy &quot;Red Dwarf.&quot; 

In 1993, Leeves joined the cast of the television series &quot;Frasier&quot; as the eccentric, forthright and psychic Mancunian Daphne Moon. By the start of the eighth season, Leeves was pregnant, and the writers incorporated her pregnancy into shows as weight gain due to her character&#x27;s stress from her relationship with Niles Crane (portrayed by David Hyde Pierce). By the conclusion of &quot;Frasier&quot;, Leeves had been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 50th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1998, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 52nd Golden Globe Awards in 1995.

In 2002, she appeared in the Broadway musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;. In 2004, she hosted an episode of the television comedy quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. Her 2006 show, The WB&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Misconceptions&quot;, went unaired.
Leeves provided guest vocals in &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot; as Lulu, a female chimp with whom Phil fell in love. With her &quot;Frasier&quot; costar Peri Gilpin, Leeves also set up the production company Bristol Cities (cockney rhyming slang for &#x27;titties&#x27;). Their last project was in 2007, a pilot for a US remake of the British sitcom &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; titled &quot;The Minister of Divine&quot; with Kirstie Alley in the title role. In 2010, Leeves guest starred in two episodes in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman)&#x27;s and Tom Scavo (Grant Show)&#x27;s therapist Dr. Graham.

From 2010 until 2015, Leeves played the 40-something ex-&quot;eyebrow artist to the stars&quot; Joy Scroggs in the TV Land comedy &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, with Valerie Bertinelli, Wendie Malick (also her co-star in the final season of &quot;Frasier&quot;) and Betty White. In 2011, she was nominated Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series with the rest of the cast at the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards. The series ended in 2015 after six seasons and 128 episodes. She returned to television in 2018 with her first regular role in a dramatic series, orthopaedic surgeon Kit Voss. the Fox medical drama &quot;The Resident&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Leeves is married to Marshall Coben, a CBS Studios executive. Peri Gilpin, Leeves&#x27;s co-star on &quot;Frasier&quot;, is her neighbor and close friend&lt;ref name=&quot;clevelandmagazine/leeves&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was in the delivery room when Leeves&#x27;s first child was born. In the season 8 episode 17 of &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;It Takes Two to Tangle&quot;, Niles tells Gilpin&#x27;s character Roz Doyle that Leeves&#x27; character Daphne has lost 9 lb 12 oz at the health spa: a reference to the actual weight of Leeves&#x27; baby girl.

<text>Edomite is a Northwest Semitic Canaanite language, very similar to Biblical Hebrew, Ekronite, Ammonite, Phoenician, Amorite and Sutean, spoken by the Edomites in Idumea (modern-day southwestern Jordan and parts of Israel) in the 2nd and 1st millennium BCE. It is extinct and known only from an extremely small corpus, attested in a scant number of impression seals, ostraca, and a single late 7th or early 6th century BCE letter, discovered in Horvat Uza.

Like Moabite, but unlike Hebrew, it retained the feminine ending &quot;-t&quot; in the singular absolute state. In early times, it seems to have been written with a Phoenician alphabet. However, by the 6th century BCE, it adopted the Aramaic alphabet. Meanwhile, Aramaic or Arabic features such as &quot;whb&quot; (&quot;gave&quot;) and &quot;tgr/tcr&quot; (&quot;merchant&quot;) entered the language, with &quot;whb&quot; becoming especially common in proper names. Like many other Canaanite languages, Edomite features a prefixed definite article derived from the presentative particle (for example as in &quot;h-ʔkl&quot; ‘the food’). The diphthong /aw/ contracted to /o/ between the 7th and 5th century BCE, as foreign transcriptions of the divine name &quot;Qos&quot; indicate a transition in pronunciation from &quot;Qāws&quot; to &quot;Qôs&quot;.

<text>Door to Door is the sixth studio album by American new wave band the Cars, released on August 25, 1987, by Elektra Records. The album was produced by frontman Ric Ocasek, with additional production by keyboardist Greg Hawkes. Three singles were released from the album, though only &quot;You Are the Girl&quot; reached the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 17. &quot;Door to Door&quot; became the Cars&#x27; lowest-charting studio album, peaking at number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and within a year of its release the band would break up.

==Background==
&quot;Door to Door&quot; was both the group&#x27;s last studio album with the original lineup before they disbanded in 1988 and the last to feature bassist Benjamin Orr before his death in 2000. The band would not release another studio album until &quot;Move Like This&quot; (2011).

Although by 1987, the Cars had reached the heights of superstardom, their last few albums had relied heavily on studio tricks and machines, but this album was an attempt to return to the group&#x27;s original roots. For example, where the previous album, &quot;Heartbeat City&quot;, extensively used sampled and sequenced drums (a move that had somewhat alienated drummer David Robinson), this album returned to having Robinson performing the drums in the studio, often simultaneously with other band members.

During a writing jam session, the band began to play &quot;Ta Ta Wayo Wayo&quot;, a song from their earliest days together. It had never been recorded in studio, except as a demo in 1977. They enjoyed the tune so much that the 1987 version of the song made it onto the album. The opening track, &quot;Leave or Stay&quot;, also was originally a 1977 demo that was not properly recorded until &quot;Door to Door&quot;, although they had often played the song live in the band&#x27;s early days. Both tracks had their respective 1977 demo versions eventually issued on the 1995 compilation &quot;Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology&quot;.

The lead single from the album, &quot;You Are the Girl&quot;, reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number two on the Album Rock Tracks chart. The follow-up single, &quot;Strap Me In&quot;, peaked at number 85 on the Hot 100, while reaching number four on the rock chart. The final single, &quot;Coming Up You&quot;, peaked at number 74 on the Hot 100, as well as number 37 on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart.

The tour to promote &quot;Door to Door&quot; would turn out to be their last with the original lineup and the show on December 12, 1987 (the final show on the tour) at the Cobo Arena in Detroit would be the last time they performed with Orr.

<doc id="585308" wikidata="Q175297" url="?curid=585308" title="Chroot">
<text>codice_1 is an operation on Unix and Unix-like operating systems that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot name (and therefore normally cannot access) files outside the designated directory tree. The term &quot;chroot&quot; may refer to the system call or the wrapper program. The modified environment is called a chroot jail.
==History==
The chroot system call was introduced during development of Version 7 Unix in 1979. One source suggests that Bill Joy added it on 18 March 1982 – 17 months before 4.2BSD was released – in order to test its installation and build system. All versions of BSD that had a kernel have chroot(2). An early use of the term &quot;jail&quot; as applied to chroot comes from Bill Cheswick creating a honeypot to monitor a hacker in 1991.

The first article about a jailbreak has been discussed on the security column of SunWorld Online which is written by Carole Fennelly; the August 1999 and January 1999 editions cover most of the chroot() topics.

To make it useful for virtualization, FreeBSD expanded the concept and in its 4.0 release in 2000 introduced the jail command.

By 2002, an article written by Nicolas Boiteux described how to create a jail on Linux.

By 2003, first internet microservices providers with Linux jails provide SAAS/PAAS (shell containers, proxy, ircd, bots, ...) services billed for consumption into the jail by usage.

By 2005, Sun released Solaris Containers (also known as Solaris Zones), described as &quot;chroot on steroids.&quot;

By 2008, LXC (upon which Docker was later built) adopted the &quot;container&quot; terminology and gained popularity in 2013 due to inclusion into Linux kernel 3.8 of user namespaces.

==Uses==
A chroot environment can be used to create and host a separate virtualized copy of the software system. This can be useful for:
; Testing and development : A test environment can be set up in the chroot for software that would otherwise be too risky to deploy on a production system.
; Dependency control : Software can be developed, built and tested in a chroot populated only with its expected dependencies. This can prevent some kinds of linkage skew that can result from developers building projects with different sets of program libraries installed.
; Compatibility : Legacy software or software using a different ABI must sometimes be run in a chroot because their supporting libraries or data files may otherwise clash in name or linkage with those of the host system.
; Recovery : Should a system be rendered unbootable, a chroot can be used to move back into the damaged environment after bootstrapping from an alternate root file system (such as from installation media, or a Live CD).
; Privilege separation : Programs are allowed to carry open file descriptors (for files, pipelines and network connections) into the chroot, which can simplify jail design by making it unnecessary to leave working files inside the chroot directory. This also simplifies the common arrangement of running the potentially vulnerable parts of a privileged program in a sandbox, in order to pre-emptively contain a security breach. Note that chroot is not necessarily enough to contain a process with root privileges.

==Limitations==
The chroot mechanism is not intended to defend against intentional tampering by privileged (root) users. A notable exception is NetBSD, on which chroot is considered a security mechanism and no escapes are known. On most systems, chroot contexts do not stack properly and chrooted programs with sufficient privileges may perform a second chroot to break out. To mitigate the risk of these security weakness, chrooted programs should relinquish root privileges as soon as practical after chrooting, or other mechanisms – such as FreeBSD jails – should be used instead. Note that some systems, such as FreeBSD, take precautions to prevent a second chroot attack.

On systems that support device nodes on ordinary filesystems, a chrooted root user can still create device nodes and mount the file systems on them; thus, the chroot mechanism is not intended by itself to be used to block low-level access to system devices by privileged users. It is not intended to restrict the use of resources like I/O, bandwidth, disk space or CPU time. Most Unixes are not completely file system-oriented and leave potentially disruptive functionality like networking and process control available through the system call interface to a chrooted program.

At startup, programs expect to find scratch space, configuration files, device nodes and shared libraries at certain preset locations. For a chrooted program to successfully start, the chroot directory must be populated with a minimum set of these files. This can make chroot difficult to use as a general sandboxing mechanism. Tools such as Jailkit can help to ease and automate this process. 

Only the root user can perform a chroot. This is intended to prevent users from putting a setuid program inside a specially crafted chroot jail (for example, with a fake and file) that would fool it into a privilege escalation.

Some Unixes offer extensions of the chroot mechanism to address at least some of these limitations (see Implementations of operating system-level virtualization technology).

==Graphical applications on chroot==
It is possible to run graphical applications on a chrooted environment, using methods such as:
* Use xhost (or copy the secret from .Xauthority)
* Nested X servers like Xnest or the more modern Xephyr (or start a real X server from inside the jail)
* Accessing the chroot via SSH using the X11 forwarding (ssh -X) feature
* xchroot an extended version of chroot for users and Xorg/X11 forwarding (socat/mount)
* An X11 VNC server and connecting a VNC client outside the environment.
* Atoms is a Linux Chroot Management Tool with a User-Friendly GUI.

==Notable applications==
The Postfix mail transfer agent may operate as a pipeline of individually chrooted helper programs.

Like 4.2BSD before it, the Debian and Ubuntu internal package-building farms use chroots extensively to catch unintentional build dependencies between packages. SUSE uses a similar method with its &quot;build&quot; program. Fedora, Red Hat, and various other RPM-based distributions build all RPMs using a chroot tool such as mock.

Many FTP servers for POSIX systems use the chroot mechanism to sandbox untrusted FTP clients. This may be done by forking a process to handle an incoming connection, then chrooting the child (to avoid having to populate the chroot with libraries required for program startup).

If privilege separation is enabled, the OpenSSH daemon will chroot an unprivileged helper process into an empty directory to handle pre-authentication network traffic for each client. The daemon can also sandbox SFTP and shell sessions in a chroot (from version 4.9p1 onwards).

ChromeOS can use a chroot to run a Linux instance using Crouton, providing an otherwise thin OS with access to hardware resources. The security implications related in this article apply here.

==Linux host kernel virtual file systems and configuration files==
To have a functional chroot environment in Linux, the kernel virtual file systems and configuration files also have to be mounted/copied from host to chroot.
# Mount Kernel Virtual File Systems
TARGETDIR=&quot;/mnt/chroot&quot;
mount -t proc proc $TARGETDIR/proc
mount -t sysfs sysfs $TARGETDIR/sys
mount -t devtmpfs devtmpfs $TARGETDIR/dev
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs $TARGETDIR/dev/shm
mount -t devpts devpts $TARGETDIR/dev/pts

# Copy /etc/hosts
/bin/cp -f /etc/hosts $TARGETDIR/etc/

# Copy /etc/resolv.conf 
/bin/cp -f /etc/resolv.conf $TARGETDIR/etc/resolv.conf

# Link /etc/mtab
chroot $TARGETDIR rm /etc/mtab 2&gt; /dev/null 
chroot $TARGETDIR ln -s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab

<text>Bernard Saisset () was an Occitan bishop of Pamiers, in the County of Foix in the south of France, whose outspoken disrespect for Philip IV of France incurred charges of high treason in the overheated atmosphere of tension between the king and his ministry and Pope Boniface VIII, leading up to the papal bull &quot;Unam sanctam&quot; of 1302.

== Biography ==
Saisset is famous in French history for his opposition to Philip IV. As an ardent Occitan aristocrat of an old noble family, he despised the northern “Frankish” French, and publicly demonstrated it by decrying the Parisian bishop of Toulouse, Pierre de la Chapelle-Taillefer, as “useless to the Church and the country, because he was of a speech that was always an enemy... because the people of the country hate him because of that language.”
Further, Saisset was sent in 1301 as a papal legate to Philip IV to protest the king’s anticlerical measures. But on his return to Pamiers he was denounced to the king as having tried to raise a rebellion of Occitan independence, associated with Navarre, under the banner of the Count of Foix (with whom Saisset had until very recently been embroiled in the courts). The king charged two northerners, Richard Leneveu, archdeacon of Auge in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lisieux, and Jean de Picquigni, vidame of Amiens, to make an investigation, which lasted several months. Philip’s ministry had a well-earned reputation for judicial violence, and Saisset was on the point of escaping to Rome when the vidame of Amiens surprised him by night in his episcopal palace at Pamiers. He was brought to Senlis, and on October 24, 1301 he appeared before Philip and his court. The chancellor Pierre Flotte charged him with high treason, and the old charges of heresy and blasphemy that were always easily levelled against 13th century Occitans, and for saying that Saint Louis was in Hell and should never have been canonized, and other less than credible charges. By a judicial fiction he was placed in the comparative safe keeping of his own metropolitan, the archbishop of Narbonne, Gilles I Aycelin de Montaigu.

Philip IV tried to obtain from the pope the canonical degradation of Saisset that was necessary before proceeding against him. Boniface VIII, instead, ordered the king to free the bishop, in order that he might go to Rome to justify himself, which opened a new stage in the quarrel between the pope and king that had been simmering since the Bull &quot;Clericis laicos&quot; of 1296. In the heat of the new struggle, Saisset was fortunately forgotten. He had been turned over in February 1302 into the keeping of Jacques des Normands, the papal legate, and was ordered to leave the kingdom at once. He lived at Rome until after the incident at Anagni.

In 1308, with a more tractable new pope (Clement V) in residence at Avignon, the king pardoned Saisset, and restored him to his see. He died in Pamiers, still its bishop, about 1314.

<text>Christophe Réaux (born December 16, 1965, France) largely and mainly known by the pseudonym Croc, is a French games designer, specialized in role-playing games (RPG) although he also has designed at least both a board game (&quot;L&#x27;Âge des dieux&quot;, &quot;Age of Gods&quot;) and a miniatures game (&quot;Hell Dorado&quot;). He is considered in his own country as a role-playing games pioneer and one of the most important designers in the ambit of such games. Croc&#x27;s games are edited by Siroz (a homophone of the French word &quot;cirrhose&quot;, meaning &quot;cirrhosis&quot;), now called Asmodée éditions, French for Asmodeus. Croc met the founders of Siroz (Nicolas Théry, Éric Bouchaud and Laurent Tremmel) in the &quot;20 Naturel&quot; RPG club of Vélizy (near Versailles) in the mid-1980s at secondary school (high school).

One of his games, &quot;In Nomine Satanis/Magna Veritas&quot; (1989), led to the less controversial English-language game, &quot;In Nomine&quot;.

==Games==
Croc&#x27;s first game, &quot;Bitume&quot; (&quot;bitume&quot; being the French word for &quot;asphalt&quot;) (created in 1984 and edited in 1986) is a post-apocalyptic &quot;Mad Max&quot;-style game. In the game, Harley&#x27;s comet comes too close to Earth and causes a cataclysm that destroys civilisation.

&quot;Animonde&quot; (1988) is &quot;poetic-fantasy&quot; world, where technology (Middle-Age level) is replaced by animals (e.g. door hinges are crabs and swords are the legs of praying mantises).

In &quot;In Nomine Satanis/Magna Veritas&quot; (INS/MV, 1989), the contemporary world is the battleground of heaven and hell, in what looks like a war between two gangs or secret services. The character may adopt the role an angel or a demon, but these are very similar.

In &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (1991), in a futuristic world, a great wall separates the rich inhabitants of the north and the poor of the south (Africa). This ultra-violent society is controlled by the CRU, the Cybernetic Repression Units (&quot;Unités de répression cybernétiques&quot;, URC). The player may play a robot from the CRU or a rebel standing against this situation. By interacting with humans, the CRU&#x27;s begin to acquire human emotions and a conscience.

In &quot;Bloodlust&quot; (1991), a heroic fantasy world inspired by characters such as Conan and Elric, the gods have incarnated themselves into weapons with great magical powers, and exist in a symbiotic relationship with their human wielders.

&quot;Stella Inquisitorus&quot; (1993) is a space opera version of &quot;In Nomine Satanis/Magna Veritas&quot; that takes place in the year 6993.

In &quot;Scales&quot; (1994), a contemporary world, the player characters are dragons in human incarnations ignorant of their true nature that discover their powers little by little.

&quot;Nightprowler&quot; (1995) is a heroic fantasy game dedicated to thieves and assassins.

In &quot;C.O.P.S.&quot; (2003), the situation is close to the style of the John Carpenter movie &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, all of United States&#x27; pollution and criminals are sent to California; the state decides to stop this and declares its independence as a land of freedom. It is now 2030, and a strong police force is created to avoid the abuse of freedom and control that the criminal situation has inherited from the past. The characters are members of the C.O.P.S. (Central Organisation for Public Security), a section of the LAPD. This game is sometimes considered as the fourth edition of &quot;Berlin XVIII&quot;, a game edited in 1988 that took place in Berlin (Germany), with a social and political context marked by the Cold War (recall that this date was before the fall of the Berlin Wall); &quot;Berlin XVIII&quot; was edited by Siroz (first in the &quot;Universom&quot; collection then as a standalone game), created by Laurent Tremmel and Nicolas Thery (Croc contributed to the third edition).

==Translation work==
Croc also translated the &quot;Car Wars&quot; boardgame and its GURPS &quot;Autoduel&quot; version (both edited and owned by Steve Jackson Games) into French, and contributes to &quot;Le Livre des cinq anneaux&quot;, the French version of AEG&#x27;s &quot;Legend of the Five Rings&quot;, edited by Siroz/Asmodée, for which he had yet participated (among others) in the translation of the adventures supplement &quot;City of Lies&quot; (into French: &quot;La Cité des mensonges&quot;).

The International Broadcast Centre was constructed at Angkasapuri, Kuala Lumpur, while Mint Hotel (now Nouvelle Hotel) served as the Main Press Centre. stage broadcaster Radio Televisyen Malaysia was the host broadcaster of the event.

=== Opening ceremony ===
The 16th Commonwealth Games opening ceremony took place on 11 September 1998 at 20:00 MST (UTC+08:00). During the ceremony, approximately 4,840 Soka Gakkai Malaysia volunteers displayed coloured flip cards which depicted sporting images, flags of the Commonwealth nations and messages that heralded the first games in Asia in the 68 years since their inception. The ceremony was preceded by a pre-show concert by Malaysian pop singers such as Noraniza Idris, Jamal Abdillah, Amy Search, Saleem, Zamani, Ella, Anuar Zain, Ziana Zain, Sheila Majid, Amy Mastura, Ning Baizura and Siti Nurhaliza, performance by local comedian Harith Iskander and 16 paratroopers who descended down the stadium.

The ceremony began with the arrival of dignitaries including the Chairman of Commonwealth Games Federation Michael Fennel, Prince Edward, Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the Yang Dipertuan Agong and Malaysian minister of Youth and Sports Muhyiddin Yassin. This was followed by the parade of nations — 69 participating nations, led by mascot Wira and previous games&#x27; mascots (Canada being the first country to come into the stadium as host country of the previous games, and Malaysia entering last as hosts).The Singaporean delegation was jeered by the crowd during the parade of nations.
Then came a performance about a Malaysian rainforest by 2,000 school children who dressed as birds, bees and flowers.

After the performance, the Queen&#x27;s message was delivered in the ceremonial baton, which had begun the final stages of its journey on the back of an elephant. 1978 Commonwealth Games badminton gold medal winner Sylvia Ng took the last lap with the baton and handed it off to Koh Eng Tong, a weightlifter who won a gold medal in weightlifting for Malaya in the 1950 British Empire Games, to take the final few feet to Prince Edward.

Contrary to tradition, the games were officially opened by the Malaysian head of stage, Yang di Pertuan Agong Tuanku Jaafar by striking the gong three times. A burst of fireworks and blurring of the giant bunga raya and a 16-gun salute which represents 1998 Commonwealth Games being the 16th-edition games, signified the beginning of the games. The Commonwealth Games flag was then brought into the stadium raised to the theme song of the Games &quot;Forever As One&quot; written by local composer, Goh Boon Hoe. Malaysian bowler Shalin Zulkifli later take the oath on behalf of the athletes.

The ceremony concluded with a 40-minute performance, titled &quot;Aur di Tebing&quot; (Bamboo at the riverside) with the theme &#x27;Unity towards Progress&#x27;, which was conveyed through dance, music, and intricate human graphics. 2,000 performers swirled and danced carrying trays of &quot;bunga emas&quot; (golden flowers) on their heads during a mass silat display. The show told the Malaysian history from ancient Malacca to the present development in Malaysia, its political, economical and technological achievements as well as its people&#x27;s vision of peace, prosperity and unity and lifestyle.

===Closing ceremony===
The closing ceremony took place on 21 September 1998 at 20:00 MST (UTC+08:00). The attendees of the ceremony included Raja Permaisuri Agong, Tuanku Najihah, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his wife, Commonwealth Games Federation President (CGF), Sir Michael Fennel; Commonwealth of Nations Secretary-general Chief Emeka Anyaoku; Minister of youth and sports Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Executive Chairman of Sukom Ninety Eight Berhad, Tan Sri Hashim Mohd. Ali.

The ceremony began with Queen Elizabeth and King Ja&#x27;afar&#x27;s arrival in a limousine, for inspection of guards of honour of the Royal Malay Regiment. The British national anthem &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; was played followed by Malaysia&#x27;s national anthem &quot;Negaraku&quot;. This was followed by a 3-part cultural performance led by a band performance by 400 school students from Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor and Kuala Lumpur followed by an upbeat song performance from local artist Jay Jay.

As the protocol says, a 15-minute presentation from Manchester, England, host city of the 2002 edition, was staged which included songs, videos and a live performance from the group New Order at the Albert Square, also the main moment was when message from British Prime Minister Tony Blair was delivered.

A contemporary farewell dance performance by local artists, featured Siti Nurhaliza and Noraniza Idris concludes the cultural performance. Soon afterwards, all the participants, flag-bearers and the volunteers march into the main ground of the stadium and Olympic council of Malaysia president Tan Sri Hamzah Abu Samah later declared the returning of the flags of all the participating nations.

Then the protocol was resumed and the 69 Commonwealth Games Associations flagbearers positioned themselves in a rostrum and the Commonwealth Games flag was lowered by the Malaysian armed forces. Next, the flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation is lowered by Malaysian Armed Forces personnel to the games theme song, Forever as one and is paraded around the stadium before being folded and handed over to the mayor of Kuala Lumpur, Tan Sri Kamarulzaman Sharif, who handed it over to the president of the Commonwealth Games Federation, Jamaican Michael Fennel.Fennel handed the flag to the Chief Citizen of Manchester city, Gordon Conquest. Following, the official speeches were delivered and Queen Elisabeth was invited to declare the Games closed. In a new protocol step, the Queen has withdrawn from the stadium alongside the King of Malaysia and other authorities, after the guard of honour march song has played, followed by Auld Lang Syne. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, later made an announcement to declare 28 September 1998 as a national public holiday to commemorate the nation&#x27;s success in hosting the games. The ceremony concluded with a concert performed by Six Commonwealth Top Singers representing the six regions of the Commonwealth Federation and local artists.

== Participating teams ==

Sixty-nine countries appeared at the 1998 Games. The only absent country was Nigeria, suspended from the Commonwealth due to the tyrannical dictatorship of Sani Abacha who had died earlier that year.

== Calendar ==

== Sports overview ==
The host nation achieved its best-ever haul of ten gold medals which has since been surpassed by its achievement in the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where Malaysia won twelve gold medals.

This is an edition marked by several unprecedented facts in the history of the Commonwealth Games. Not only because it is the first in Asia and the first that was not opened by a member of the royal family.And taking advantage of these factors, the Commonwealth Games Federation decided in 1994 that from this edition onwards, team sports could enter the Games program.As a result, the number of sports played rose from 10 to 16.The case studies determined that three team sports were eligible to become mandatory: field hockey (men and women), netball (women) and rugby 7&#x27;s (men). Adding to aquatics (swimming) (athletics), boxing, badminton, cycling (road), weightlifting, and lawn bowls as compulsory sports. As decided also in 1994, the Organizing Committee could choose up to six sports from a list previously approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) and which reflect their respective popularity in the organizing country. And they were the following: aquatics (synchronized swimming and diving), cricket, cycling (track), gymnastics (artistic and rhythmic), and shooting sports. Another spot was reserved for squash, which was an evaluation sport and could become mandatory in the next edition. There was still a spot for a local sport and the organizers chose ten-pin bowling because of the local infrastructure. Which was included as an extra sport because of its popularity in the country and also because of infrastructure spending. However, there was some controversy surrounding the removal of wrestling that had been present in all previous editions because of its low popularity in Malaysia.

In front of 20,000 fans at the Petaling Jaya Stadium, rugby sevens in particular were an enormous success with New Zealand collecting its 100th Commonwealth Games medal with a 21–12 win over plucky Fiji, (the reigning world champions). Man of the match was the giant Jonah Lomu who had worked tirelessly during the 10-minutes-each-way final. Led by veteran star David Campese, Australia took the bronze beating Samoa 33–12.
In the squash event many had anticipated a close match between Michelle Martin and Sarah Fitz-Gerald who had both comfortably won their respective semi-finals. Fitz-Gerald had won the previous two years&#x27; World Opens and Martin the three prior to that and so it was with some surprise to many that Martin took the gold in three straight sets 9–0, 9–6, 9–5. Fitz-Gerald did avenge this defeat in the final of the world championship later that year, in what many people regard as the greatest women&#x27;s final ever, coming back from 8–2 down in the fifth to retain her title.Martin also teamed up with Craig Rowland to take the Commonwealth mixed doubles gold.
Erika-Leigh Stirton took five of the six available gold medals in the rhythmic gymnastics only being beaten into second place in the team event in the hosts took gold.

== Medal table ==
Only the top ten successful nations are displayed here.

The ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a &quot;nation&quot; is an entity represented by a Commonwealth Games Association). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their three-letter country code.

=== Logo ===

The logo of the 1998 Commonwealth Games is an image of the national flower of Malaysia, the hibiscus (the &quot;bunga raya&quot;), the first games logo to introduce the colour yellow. (All previous logos had been red, white and blue to reflect the colours of the British Union Flag.) The red, blue, white and yellow colours represents the colours of the Malaysian national flag and Malaysia as a confident, young, dynamic nation. The yellow pollens represent the six regions of the world that includes the 68 Commonwealth member nations.

===Mascot===
The official mascot of the 1998 Commonwealth Games is an orangutan named &quot;Wira&quot; (Malay for &quot;warrior&quot; or &quot;hero&quot;). It is said that the orangutan is the largest and probably the most intelligent primate in Asia which lives in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia. The adoption of orangutan as a games&#x27; mascot is to represent the friendly personality of Malaysia as the games&#x27; host as well as the charm, intelligence, and sporting ability of the participating athletes.

=== Sponsors ===
A total of 55 companies and organisations sponsored the games, including Malaysian state-owned enterprises.

=== 1998 Klang Valley Water Crisis ===
The 1998 Klang Valley water crisis was a water shortage that affected the biggest metropolitan region of the country. This water shortage affected almost all the residents in the Klang Valley, causing the government to impose water rationing prior to the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.

This crisis was blamed on El Niño despite actual rainfall in the months leading up to February 1998 in Federal Territory not being significantly below average. In fact in November 1997, Klang Gates Dam had its highest recorded rainfall. Similarly in October 1997 the Kajang station not far from the Semenyih dam had its highest rainfall in record.

<doc id="585325" wikidata="Q3269760" url="?curid=585325" title="Battle of the Indus">
<text>The Battle of the Indus was fought on the banks of the Indus River, on 24 November 1221, between the armies commanded by Jalal al-Din of the Khwarazmian Empire, and Genghis Khan of the Mongol Empire. The battle, which resulted in an overwhelming Mongol victory, was the concluding engagement in the Mongol conquest of the Khwarazmian Empire.

After his father Muhammad II had died on an island in the Caspian Sea, Jalal al-Din assumed the title of Khwarazmshah and travelled eastwards. Escaping the Mongols several times, he reached Ghazni and started assembling a large force; he then defeated the Mongol commander Shigi Qutuqu at the Battle of Parwan. This upset victory drew the attention and ire of Genghis Khan, who gathered a force of at least 50,000 and moved towards the Shah, who had lost a large proportion of his force because of a dispute over plunder. Now unable to effectively combat the Khan, he retreated eastwards towards the Indus river; the Mongols caught up to the Khwarazmians on the morning they were due to cross the Indus.

The Shah&#x27;s army, now numbering around 30,000, assumed a strong defensive position on the banks of the river. They acquitted themselves well in the early fighting, managing to drive back the Mongol forces despite being heavily outnumbered. However, after an elite Mongol detachment managed to outflank the Khwarazmians, the Shah realized the battle was lost; in full armour, he rode his horse off a cliff into the Indus. As a mark of respect for his enemy&#x27;s bravery, the Khan ordered his archers not to fire, and so the Shah managed to gain the opposite bank; however, his family and nearly all his army were slaughtered.

== Background ==

Genghis Khan had invaded Khwarazm with an army of between 75,000 and 200,000 soldiers in late 1219. Shah Muhammad II, wary of Mongol skill in battle and doubtful of his commanders&#x27; loyalties, adopted a defence in depth strategy based on garrisoning his cities, especially Otrar, Samarkand and Gurganj. However, the Khan demonstrated superior strategic ability, splitting the Shah&#x27;s forces to take Bukhara in February 1220 and Samarkand in March; the border town of Otrar held out for six months until it fell in April. Genghis sent a 30,000 to 40,000 strong Mongol army led by Jebe and Subutai to hunt down the Shah, who had begun to flee west with his eldest son Jalal al-Din. The Mongol army sacked numerous cities during their long pursuit, including Tus, Qazvin and Ardabil; however, the Shah found refuge on an island in the Caspian Sea, where he died in December 1220.

Jalal al-Din reached the city of Gurganj, the former capital of the empire, after his father&#x27;s death, but found that the nobility was hostile to him, preferring his half-brother Uzlaq-Shah. Discovering a plot against his life, Jalal al-Din left the city and set out southwards across the Karakum Desert, emerging near Nisa where he defeated a Mongol detachment. Meanwhile, two large Mongol forces, led by the Khan&#x27;s two eldest sons Jochi and Chagatai, converged on Gurganj from the northeast and southeast respectively; the capture of the city would take another six months and additional Mongol forces, led by Ögedei, to be accomplished. At the same time, Genghis had sent his youngest son Tolui to conquer the region of Khorasan, which Tolui completed speedily and with extreme devastation — the cities of Merv, Nishapur were destroyed and their populations massacred, while Herat was betrayed to the Mongols and escaped destruction. Jalal al-Din narrowly escaped being caught at Nishapur, where he had hoped to raise an army; he evaded his pursuers and managed to reach Bost, where his maternal uncle Amin Malik joined him with a reasonable force. The Shah then moved to Ghazni, where many Khwarazmian loyalists, including Qurlaq, Khalaj and Turkmens, joined him and within a few weeks he had amassed a well-equipped, if not firmly united, army of around 65,000 soldiers.

==Battle of Parwan and prelude==

After Jalal al-Din moved against some Mongol forces in the area, Genghis Khan sent Shigi Qutuqu with force of between thirty and fifty thousand to defeat the Shah; however, Qutuqu was unexpectedly defeated at the Battle of Parwan in the autumn of 1221. News of this defeat led to large rebellions in several cities, including Merv and Herat. Unfortunately for Jalal al-Din, a large proportion of his force, mostly Afghans under Saif al-Din Ighrak, deserted after the battle because of a dispute over spoils. The Shah knew that the sudden loss of nearly half his army would probably prove fatal, so he decided to seek refuge in India. He returned to Ghazni and then marched east, making for the Indus River to cross into India. However, his pace was slow because a large number of refugees was accompanying his army.

The Mongols had conducted two month-long sieges at Rang Castle and Bamyan, but Genghis Khan marched towards Ghazni after receiving news of the defeat at Parwan. The Mongols sent detachments ahead to seize several passes that led from Ghazni to Peshawar, so when the deserters under Ighrak finally decided to rejoin Jalal al-Din, he found the way barred. One Mongol detachment was defeated by Jalal al-Din at Gadriz, but the Mongols, travelling at the fastest possible pace, managed to catch up on the banks of the Indus, defeating his rearguard.

===Battle deployment===
Both armies formed up for battle at dawn. Jalal al-Din took command of the center with 5,000 troops, including 700 bodyguards in reserve. Amin Malik took command of the Turks on the right wing, while the Afghans manned the left wing, probably commanded by Temur Malik. The Shah anchored his left wing on a ridge that ran straight into the river, while the flank on the right wing was protected by the riverbank. With this placement, the Shah had taken away the Mongol advantage of fighting a mobile battle of outflanking manoeuvres, and by fighting in a confined space, their advantage of having superior numbers were reduced.

Genghis deployed his forces in a crescent-shape, pinning the Khwarazmians against the river; he personally commanded the reserve to make sure the Shah wouldn&#x27;t be able to break through the Mongol lines and escape. The Mongol right was commanded by Chagatai and the left by his brother Ögedei. The Mongol army outnumbered Jalal al-Din&#x27;s forces by a large margin, but they probably were exhausted from their forced march across the mountains and Genghis Khan may have engaged the enemy before his full force had gathered.

== Battle ==

At dawn on 24 November, the battle began with the wings engaging each other; the Khwarazmian left held their strong defensive position despite the Khan consistently feeding in new troops, while Ögedei was driven back on the Mongol left. Realizing the strength of the ridge, Genghis sent a general named Bela Noyan with an elite &quot;bahadur&quot; tumen to climb it and outflank the Khwarazmians. Jalal al-Din attacked the Mongol center; although his personal biographer al-Nasawi has him reach Genghis Khan and put him to flight. Even though the Mongols could not use their arrows effectively in the crowded conditions, they managed to stop the Khwarazmian advance, killing Temur Malik in the mêlée.

Although many men were lost during Bela Noyan&#x27;s climb, the Mongol detachment successfully scaled the ridge and attacked the Shah&#x27;s left wing from the flank and rear. The Khwarazmian right was also retreating, and eventually broke; Amin Malik was intercepted and killed as he tried to flee to Peshawar. Even though it was evident that the battle was now lost, Jalal al-Din continued to fight until noon. After his maternal cousin Akhash Malik implored him to flee, he charged the now Mongol-controlled ridge, breaking through the lines. He then rode his horse off the edge of the 30-foot cliff, but managed to reach the opposite shore. Witnessing the feat and calling his sons to witness, Genghis forbade his archers to shoot the Shah and stated &quot;Fortunate should be the father of such a son&quot;.

Although the Shah&#x27;s life was spared, the lives of his men, most of whom had followed their leader&#x27;s example, were not. In total, only around four thousand reached the other bank, with many being shot in the water by Mongol archers. The Shah’s camp, harem and treasures were captured, and all male members of his family, including his seven year old and infant sons, were killed.

== Aftermath ==
Jalal al-Din managed to collect the survivors of his army; displaying his military acumen, he defeated local rulers and started establishing a small state in India. Genghis did not make any great effort to pursue his defeated foe, only sending troops when Jalal al-Din recrossed the Indus to bury his dead. The Khan was mostly occupied with subjugating the Afghans near Jalalabad, and the Mongol army then wintered in the Swat valley. Genghis Khan next sent his son Ögedei to sack Ghazni and subdue some of the Afghan mountain forts, a task which took fifteen months to fully accomplish. With that done, the Khan returned to Mongolia leisurely, reaching it in 1224–25.

A small force commanded by Dorbei Doqshin failed to make contact with Jalal al-Din; when he rejoined the Khan at Samarkand, he was immediately sent out once again on the same mission, with orders not to fail. They besieged the Shah for forty days in spring 1224, before the summer heat forced them to retreat. Jalal al-Din later received news from his brother Ghiyath al-Din, who had established dominion over the Khwarazmian territories in Western Iran and Iraq, inviting him to return and re-establish Khwarazmian power. Leaving his lands in the Punjab in the hands of a lieutenant, the Shah then marched across Makran, leaving India after a stay of three years, to set up his rule in parts of Persia and Anatolia. Before the Battle of Garni in 1225, Jalal al-Din sent a letter to Queen Rusudan demanding Georgian submission; Rusudan responded with an insulting letter, mocking how badly the Khwarazmshah had been beaten by Genghis Khan at the Indus.

<text>The Bücker Bü 131 &quot;Jungmann&quot; (freshman, young man) is a basic biplane trainer aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Bücker Flugzeugbau. It was the company&#x27;s first aircraft, as well as being the final biplane to be produced in Germany.

On 27 April 1934, the first prototype Bü 131 performed its maiden flight, which was roughly two years after the company had been founded in Berlin-Johannisthal by Carl Bücker. Anders J. Andersson had led the aircraft&#x27;s design effort. Comprising both metal and wooden construction, the Bü 131 was designed to be suitable in the trainer role, and even to perform aerobatic manoeuvres. The first deliveries of the Bü 131 occurred in 1934, the &quot;Deutscher Luftsportverband&quot; (DLV) being a key early customer for the type. Later on, the Bü 131B was selected as the primary basic trainer for the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. In this capacity, it was operated in large numbers throughout the Second World War.

Throughout the 1930s, there had been substantial demand for the Bü 131, multiple large export orders and production licenses were issued as a result. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was the largest pre-war export customer for the type, flying as many as 400 Bü 131s at one point. Hundreds were produced locally by the Spanish aircraft company Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA). In excess of 1,300 Bü 131s were operated by the military air services of Imperial Japan under local designations of &quot;Kokusai Ki-86&quot; and &quot;Kyushu K9W&quot;. The Bü 131 remained operation with numerous air forces for decades after the conflict, some choosing to retain the type through to the late 1960s. It has proved to be a relatively popular biplane with private pilots, who have often elected to have their aircraft refitted with modern engines for increased performance.

==Development==
The origins of the Bü 131 can be traced back to the work of one man, Carl Bücker. After serving in the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; during the First World War, Bücker relocated to Sweden and became the managing director of Svenska Aero AB (Not to be confused with &quot;Svenska Aeroplan AB&quot;, SAAB). He later returned to Germany with Anders J. Andersson, a young designer from SAAB, and founded a new company, &quot;Bücker Flugzeugbau GmbH&quot;, in Berlin-Johannisthal during 1932. From the onset, Anderson headed up the company&#x27;s design team, and immediately set about developing the company&#x27;s first aircraft, out of the efforts for which ultimately emerged the Bü 131.

The aircraft was designed to be suitable for aerobatic manoeuvres and training activities. It featured numerous conventional features for such aircraft at that time, being a biplane with two open cockpits in tandem along with fixed landing gear. Both the upper and lower wings were broadly identical in terms of design, to the extent that they could be readily interchanged with on another. Accordingly, all of the wings, which had an 11 degree sweep back and positive stagger, were equipped with ailerons. The wings had a structure largely composed of I-section wooden spars along with a fabric covering.

The fuselage of the Bü 131 comprised a structure of welded steel tubing, the covering of which was metal for the front section and fabric around the rear section. Both fuel and oil were accommodated in tanks within the fuselage. Hinged to the side of the fuselage was the twin main legs of the undercarriage, which were furnished with both spring and oil-based shock absorbers, while a spring tailwheel was also present on the underside of the aft fuselage. The mainwheels were outfitted with balloon tyres and brakes.

On 27 April 1934, the first prototype, &quot;D-3150&quot;, performed its maiden flight; it was piloted by Joachim von Koppen. Early aircraft were powered by a single Hirth HM60R four-cylinder inverted air-cooled inline engine, capable of producing up to . Initial deliveries to customers commenced later that same year, making it the company&#x27;s first aircraft to attain production status. It would ultimately be the final biplane to be manufactured in quantity within Germany.

During 1936, production was transitioned to a revised model, designated &quot;Bü 131B&quot;. This model featured a more powerful Hirth 504A-2, which could produce up to . The &quot;Bü 131C&quot; model, which never entered quantity production, was powered by the British Blackburn Cirrus Minor, capable of up to .

Due to the copious demand for the type, multiple companies were granted licenses to produce the Bü 131. One such license was secured by the rival German manufacturer Dornier, which built 88 aircraft of the 94 ultimately operated by Switzerland. Eleven aircraft (one prototype and ten production aircraft) were built as the &quot;T 131&quot; in Czechoslovakia by Ringhoffer-Tatra prior to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, with further aircraft under production being completed for the Germany before Tatra was ordered to cease aircraft production. While Tatra was ordered to stop production by the German occupiers, the Prague-based aircraft manufacturer Aero, was assigned to build the Bu-131D-2 for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, with production reaching 24 per month. Production at Aero continued until September 1940, before the factory transitioned to production of the Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Uhu, with about 300 built. Perhaps the most ambitious licensee was the Spanish aircraft company Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA), which ultimately locally produced roughly 530 aircraft until the line was finally closed down sometime in the early 1960s.

In 1945, Aero restarted production of the Bü 131 to meet the needs of the Czechoslovak Air Force for training aircraft. Initial production, designated the Aero C-4, was powered by the Hirth HM 504A engine, with deliveries starting in April 1946. After building 20–30 C-4s, production switched to the Aero C-104, powered by the Czechoslovak Walter Minor 4-III engine. Production continued until 1949, with 260 built.

==Operational history==

Being both a sturdy and agile aircraft, the Bü 131A was first delivered to the &quot;Deutscher Luftsportverband&quot; (DLV) during 1934. Shortly thereafter, the Bü 131B was selected as the primary basic trainer for the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. During the Second World War, the aircraft served with nearly all of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s primary flying schools, as well as with night harassment units such as &quot;Nachtschlacht Gruppen&quot; (NSGr) 2, 11, and 12. During the latter half of the conflict, the Bü 131 was gradually supplanted by the Bücker Bü 181 Bestmann, a newer monoplane trainer.

Prior to the outbreak of war, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was the leading export customer for the type; it has been claimed that as many as 400 Bü 131s may have found their way there. Another pre-war operator was the Kingdom of Bulgaria, which had 15 aircraft, while the Kingdom of Romania procured around 40 Bü 131s.

The Bü 131 was also widely used by Imperial Japan, where they were normally equipped with locally-built &quot;Hatsukaze&quot; engines. 1,037 aircraft were built under the &quot;Kokusai Ki-86&quot; designation for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service while a further 339 aircraft were produced as the &quot;Kyushu K9W&quot; for the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service.

During the post-war era, the type continued to be flown by several operators. Most substantially, the Bü 131 remained the primary basic trainer of the Spanish Air Force through to 1968. The Czechoslovak C-4 and C-104 were used to equip the Czechoslovak military air academy, and from 1947, aircraft were released to civilian use. In the 1950s, C-104s were phased out of Czechoslovak Air Force duties, being transferred to aeroclubs, with the last aircraft being retired from Svazarm flying clubs in 1964. 

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Spanish, Swiss, and Czech governments disposed their Bü 131s, often to private owners, leading to numerous aircraft being exported to the United States. About 200 Bü 131 survived through to the twenty-first century, although many of these have been outfitted with newer engines such as the Lycoming O-320 or Lycoming O-360 four-cylinder horizontally-opposed engines, which have inverted fuel and oil systems for aerobatic flight. Well known aerobatic pilot Marion Cole flew a Bucker Jungman fitted with a Lycoming IO-360 with an inverted fuel system in many airshows and in the World Championship held in East Germany in 1968 as a member of the American Team.

The Bü 131 has often been praised for its outstanding handling characteristics when compared to other biplanes and even some modern aerobatic types. Upkeep and maintenance for the Jungmann is comparable to other antique aircraft and is often superior when fitted with the Lycoming engines. Airframe parts are available from sources both in the United States and Europe.

During 1994, the Bü 131 was briefly restored to production using leftover CASA jigs by Bücker Prado in Spain, resulting in 21 aircraft being constructed as the &quot;BP 131&quot;. Also in the 1990s, Janusz Karasiewicz also started production of a derivative of the Bü 131 in Poland, basing the aircraft on original Czech design information. A total of 20 aircraft were reportedly manufactured in Poland between 1994 and 2000.

<text>The Ensemble Georgika was formed in Tbilisi in 1989. The thirteen members of Ensemble Georgika, likely the first group of their kind to exist without government funding or support, grew up among a variety of Georgian folk music and ritual dances. 

Beginning as an a cappella troupe that performed working, table, and ritual songs, as well as Georgian Orthodox liturgical chants, in 1990 the group was joined in performance by Aleko Khizanishvili and his trio of instrumentalists who play Salamuri and Panduri.</text><links>

<doc id="585332" wikidata="Q1542680" url="?curid=585332" title="Steel Pulse">
<text>Steel Pulse are a roots reggae band from the Handsworth area of Birmingham, England. They originally formed at Handsworth Wood Boys School, and were composed of David Hinds (lead vocals, guitar), Basil Gabbidon (lead guitar, vocals), and Ronald McQueen (bass); along with Basil&#x27;s brother Colin briefly on drums and Mykaell Riley (vocals, percussion). Steel Pulse were the first non-Jamaican act to win the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. Collectively the band has won one Grammy award with nine nominations.

==History==

Basil Gabbidon and David Hinds became inspired to form Steel Pulse after listening to Bob Marley and The Wailers&#x27; &quot;Catch a Fire&quot;. The band formed in 1975; their debut single release &quot;Kibudu, Mansetta And Abuku&quot; arrived on the small independent label Dip, and linked the plight of urban black youth with the image of a greater African homeland. They followed it with &quot;Nyah Luv&quot; for Anchor. They were initially refused live dates in Caribbean venues in Birmingham due to their Rastafarian beliefs. During the popularization of punk rock in the mid-1970&#x27;s, Steel Pulse began to play punk venues such as the Hope and Anchor in London and The Electric Circus in Manchester in 1976.

Aligning themselves closely with the Rock Against Racism organization and featuring in its first music festival in early 1978, they chose to tour with sympathetic elements of the punk movement, including the Stranglers and XTC. Eventually they found a more natural home in support slots for Burning Spear, which brought them to the attention of Island Records.

=== Island Records era (1977–1980) ===
Their first release for Island was the &quot;Ku Klux Klan&quot; single, about the evils of racism, and one often accompanied by a visual parody of the sect on stage; the song was ranked the 460th-greatest song of all time in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2020 edition of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. By this time, their ranks had swelled to include Selwyn Brown (keyboards), Steve &quot;Grizzly&quot; Nisbett (drums), Alphonso Martin (vocals, percussion) and Mykaell Riley (vocals). Their debut album, &quot;Handsworth Revolution&quot; (recorded in 1977 and released in early 1978), was part the evolution of roots reggae outside Jamaica. However, despite critical and moderate commercial success over three albums, the relationship with Island Records had soured by the advent of their third album, &quot;Caught You&quot; (released in the US as &quot;Reggae Fever&quot;).

The band made their US concert debut at the Mudd Club in New York in 1980.

Tom Terrell, who would later serve as their manager, was instrumental in masterminding a Steel Pulse concert on the night of Bob Marley&#x27;s funeral, which was broadcast live around the world from the 9:30 Club, 930 F Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., on 21 May 1981.

=== Wise Man Doctrine and Elektra era (1982–1985) ===
In 1982 Steel Pulse formed their own label Wise Man Doctrine Records. They also reached a distribution deal with Elektra Records for the US market. They released &quot;True Democracy&quot;, distinguished by the Garvey-eulogizing &#x27;Rally Round&#x27; cut. A further definitive set arrived in &quot;Earth Crisis&quot; in 1984. However, Elektra chose to take a leaf out of Island&#x27;s book in trying to coerce Steel Pulse into a more mainstream vein, asking them to emulate the pop-reggae stance of Eddy Grant. &quot;Babylon the Bandit&quot; was consequently weakened, but did contain &quot;Not King James Version&quot;.

Steel Pulse released &quot;Babylon The Bandit&quot; in 1985, for which the band won a Grammy award.

=== MCA Records era (1988–1997) ===
Their next move was to MCA for &quot;State of Emergency&quot; (1988), which retained some of the synthesized dance elements of its predecessor.

&quot;Rastafari&quot; &quot;Centennial,&quot; Steel Pulse&#x27;s first live record, was recorded live at the Elysee Montmartre in Paris, over three nights in January 1992, and dedicated to the hundred-year anniversary of the birth of Haile Selassie. It was the first recording since the defection of Alphonso Martin, leaving the trio of Hinds, Nisbett and Selwyn. While they still faced criticism at the hands of British reggae fans, in the United States their reputation was growing, becoming the first ever reggae band to appear on the &quot;Tonight&quot; television show. Their profile was raised further when, in 1992, Hinds challenged the New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission in the Supreme Court, asserting that their cab drivers discriminated against black people in general and Rastafarians in particular. The lawsuit was later dropped by Steel Pulse.

In 1989 the group contributed &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand it&quot; to the soundtrack of Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Do The Right Thing&quot;.
In 1994 the group headlined some of the world&#x27;s biggest reggae festivals including Reggae Sunsplash USA, Jamaican Sunsplash, Japan Splash and Northern California annual Reggae on the River Festival. In 1986, Steel Pulse contributed a version of &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Tower&quot; on Pow Wow Records&#x27; &quot;Fire on the Mountain: Reggae Celebrates the Grateful Dead&quot; compilation. They recorded The Police&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot; for a reggae compilation of Police tunes that appeared on the Ark 21 label. &quot;Rastanthology&quot;, a 17-song collection of Steel Pulse classics, was released on the band&#x27;s own Wise Man Doctrine label in 1996.

=== Later years (1997–present) ===

In 1997 the band released &quot;Rage and Fury&quot;.

Until February 2001 it had been many years since Pulse had performed in their hometown of Birmingham. They decided to perform at the Ray Watts memorial concert, which was held at the Irish Centre. Pulse shared the stage with Watts&#x27; band, Beshara, along with other artists from Birmingham.

In 2004 Steel Pulse returned to their militant roots with &quot;African Holocaust&quot; – their eleventh studio album. With guest appearances by Damian Marley, Capleton, and Tiken Jah Fakoly (on the track African Holocaust), the album is a collection of protest and spiritual songs, including &quot;Global Warning&quot; (a dire warning about climate change), &quot;Tyrant&quot;, a protest song against political corruption, and &quot;No More Weapons&quot;, an anti-war song. Also featured on the album is a cover of the Bob Dylan song, &quot;George Jackson&quot;.

In 2007 the band released a music video for the track &quot;Door of No Return&quot;. The video was produced by Driftwood Pictures Ltd., and was shot on location in Senegal and New York City. The video was directed by Trishul Thejasvi and produced by Yoni Gal. The video had its world premier at the Times 51st BFI London Film Festival in October 2007.

In a 2013 interview with &quot;Midnight Raver&quot;, David Hinds indicated that a new studio album and documentary, tentatively titled &quot;Steel Pulse: The Definitive Story&quot;, would be released in 2014. However, on 10 July 2014 &quot;Midnight Raver&quot; reported that, according to Hinds, both the studio album and documentary will be delayed until at least 2015.

In anticipation of a new Steel Pulse album, the Roots Reggae Library has indexed two compilation albums of the latest Steel Pulse singles. The albums are called &quot;Positivity&quot; and &quot;Jah Way&quot;, both named after tracks on the albums.

In October 2018 Steel Pulse announced their new album, the first in 14 years, &quot;Mass Manipulation&quot;, was released on Rootfire Cooperative a non-traditional label which provides interest free loans and label services to independent musicians. The single &quot;Stop You Coming and Come&quot; was released on 7 December. The album was nominated for the 2020 Grammy Awards.

On 22 March 2023 the Easy Star All-Stars released a cover of &quot;Five Years&quot; in collaboration with Steel Pulse, from their album &quot;Ziggy Stardub&quot;, a reggae reimagining of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;. A music video, directed by Robert Bartolome, was released on the same day.

Former drummer Conrad Kelly died on 8 May 2024, at the age of 65.

== Awards and nominations ==
A Grammy Award was given for their 1986 album &quot;Babylon the Bandit.&quot; Steel Pulse has also been nominated for albums &quot;Victims&quot; (1991), &quot;Rastafari Centennial&quot; (1992), &quot;Rage and Fury&quot; (1998), &quot;Living Legacy&quot; (2000). and &quot;Mass Manipulation&quot; (2019).

<doc id="585336" wikidata="Q1078424" url="?curid=585336" title="Operators in C and C++">
<text>This is a list of operators in the C and C++ programming languages. 

All listed operators are in C++ and lacking indication otherwise, in C as well. Some tables include a &quot;In C&quot; column that indicates whether an operator is also in C. Note that C does not support operator overloading.

When not overloaded, for the operators codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3 (the comma operator), there is a sequence point after the evaluation of the first operand.

Most of the operators available in C and C++ are also available in other C-family languages such as C#, D, Java, Perl, and PHP with the same precedence, associativity, and semantics.

Many operators specified by a sequence of symbols are commonly referred to by a name that consists of the name of each symbol. For example, codice_4 and codice_5 are often called &quot;plus equal(s)&quot; and &quot;minus equal(s)&quot;, instead of the more verbose &quot;assignment by addition&quot; and &quot;assignment by subtraction&quot;.

==Operators==
In the following tables, lower case letters such as codice_6 and codice_7 represent literal values, object/variable names, or l-values, as appropriate. codice_8, codice_9 and codice_10 stand for a data type, and codice_11 for a class or enumeration type. Some operators have alternative spellings using digraphs and trigraphs or operator synonyms.

===Arithmetic===

C and C++ have the same arithmetic operators and all can be overloaded in C++.

===Relational===

All relational (comparison) operators can be overloaded in C++. Since C++20, the inequality operator is automatically generated if codice_12 is defined and all four relational operators are automatically generated if codice_13 is defined.

===Logical===

C and C++ have the same logical operators and all can be overloaded in C++.

Note that overloading logical &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;OR&quot; is discouraged, because as overloaded operators they always evaluate both operands instead of providing the normal semantics of short-circuit evaluation.

===Bitwise===

C and C++ have the same bitwise operators and all can be overloaded in C++.

===Assignment===

C and C++ have the same assignment operators and all can be overloaded in C++.

For the combination operators, codice_14 (where codice_15 represents an operation) is equivalent to codice_16, except that codice_6 is evaluated only once.

===Member and pointer===
===Other===
=== Synonyms ===
C++ defines keywords to act as aliases for a number of operators:
Each keyword is a different way to specify an operator and as such can be used instead of the corresponding symbolic variation. For example, and specify the same behavior. As another example, the codice_18 keyword may be used to replace not only the &quot;bitwise-and&quot; operator but also the &quot;address-of&quot; operator, and it can be used to specify reference types (e.g., ). 

The ISO C specification makes allowance for these keywords as preprocessor macros in the header file . For compatibility with C, C++ also provides the header , the inclusion of which has no effect. Until C++20, it also provided the corresponding header  which had no effect as well.

==Expression evaluation order==
During expression evaluation, the order in which sub-expressions are evaluated is determined by precedence and associativity. An operator with higher precedence is evaluated before a operator of lower precedence and the operands of an operator are evaluated based on associativity. The following table describes the precedence and associativity of the C and C++ operators. Operators are shown in groups of equal precedence with groups ordered in descending precedence from top to bottom (lower order is higher precedence).

Operator precedence is not affected by overloading. 

===Details===
Although this table is adequate for describing most evaluation order, it does not describe a few details. The ternary operator allows any arbitrary expression as its middle operand, despite being listed as having higher precedence than the assignment and comma operators. Thus codice_19 is interpreted as codice_20, and not as the meaningless codice_21. So, the expression in the middle of the conditional operator (between codice_22 and codice_23) is parsed as if parenthesized. Also, the immediate, un-parenthesized result of a C cast expression cannot be the operand of codice_24. Therefore, codice_25 is interpreted as codice_26 and not codice_27.

===Chained expressions===
The precedence table determines the order of binding in chained expressions, when it is not expressly specified by parentheses.
* For example, codice_28 is ambiguous without some precedence rule(s). The precedence table tells us that: is &#x27;bound&#x27; more tightly to than to , so that whatever does (now or later—see below), it does it ONLY to (and not to codice_29); it is equivalent to (codice_30, codice_29).
* Similarly, with codice_32, where though the post-fix is designed to act AFTER the entire expression is evaluated, the precedence table makes it clear that ONLY gets incremented (and NOT codice_33). In fact, the expression (codice_34, codice_35) is evaluated with being a temporary value. It is functionally equivalent to something like (codice_36, codice_30, codice_38).

* Abstracting the issue of precedence or binding, consider the diagram above for the expression 3+2*y[i]++. The compiler&#x27;s job is to resolve the diagram into an expression, one in which several unary operators (call them 3+( . ), 2*( . ), ( . )++ and ( . )[ i ]) are competing to bind to y. The order of precedence table resolves the final sub-expression they each act upon: ( . )[ i ] acts only on y, ( . )++ acts only on y[i], 2*( . ) acts only on y[i]++ and 3+( . ) acts &#x27;only&#x27; on 2*((y[i])++). It is important to note that WHAT sub-expression gets acted on by each operator is clear from the precedence table but WHEN each operator acts is not resolved by the precedence table; in this example, the ( . )++ operator acts only on y[i] by the precedence rules but binding levels alone do not indicate the timing of the postfix ++ (the ( . )++ operator acts only after y[i] is evaluated in the expression).

===Binding===
The binding of operators in C and C++ is specified by a factored language grammar, rather than a precedence table. This creates some subtle conflicts. For example, in C, the syntax for a conditional expression is:
logical-OR-expression ? expression : conditional-expression
while in C++ it is:
logical-OR-expression ? expression : assignment-expression
Hence, the expression:
e = a &lt; d ? a++ : a = d
is parsed differently in the two languages. In C, this expression is a syntax error, because the syntax for an assignment expression in C is:
unary-expression &#x27;=&#x27; assignment-expression
In C++, it is parsed as:
e = (a &lt; d ? a++ : (a = d))
which is a valid expression.

To use the comma operator in a function call argument expression, variable assignment, or a comma-separated list, use of parentheses is required. For example, 
int a = 1, b = 2, weirdVariable = (++a, b), d = 4;
===Criticism of bitwise and equality operators precedence===
The precedence of the bitwise logical operators has been criticized. Conceptually, &amp; and | are arithmetic operators like * and +.

The expression is syntactically parsed as whereas the expression is parsed as . This requires parentheses to be used more often than they otherwise would.

Historically, there was no syntactic distinction between the bitwise and logical operators. In BCPL, B and early C, the operators didn&#x27;t exist. Instead had different meaning depending on whether they are used in a &#x27;truth-value context&#x27; (i.e. when a Boolean value was expected, for example in it behaved as a logical operator, but in it behaved as a bitwise one). It was retained so as to keep backward compatibility with existing installations.

Moreover, in C++ (and later versions of C) equality operations, with the exception of the three-way comparison operator, yield bool type values which are conceptually a single bit (1 or 0) and as such do not properly belong in &quot;bitwise&quot; operations.

<text>Handsworth Revolution is the debut album by British reggae band Steel Pulse. It is named after the Handsworth district of Birmingham, England, the band&#x27;s home district to which the album was dedicated.

Handsworth Revolution peaked at No. 9 on the UK Pop Album charts and No. 34 on the Swedish Pop Album charts.

==Background==
The first Steel Pulse single for Island Records, &quot;Ku Klux Klan&quot; (a call for resistance against forces of racism), was released in February 1978. Five months later, their debut album was released to critical acclaim. &quot;Handsworth Revolution&quot; was produced by Karl Pitterson, who had worked with Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh. The album reached #9 on the British charts ten days after its release. The band would soon support Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers on a 12-date European tour in June and July 1978, including concerts in Paris, Ibiza, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Oslo, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Brussels. The tour kicked off with an outdoor festival at the New Bingley Hall in Stafford. David Hinds recalls:

We learned a lot of discipline on that tour that rubbed off - rehearsal, execution on stage, how to tour, stability [...] that&#x27;s when the doors really started to open for us. It has always been one of the most memorable moments of my career. To play as part of that package exposed Steel Pulse to audiences that literally were in awe of our message. Of course, being formally introduced through Bob Marley helped us tremendously. Playing for audiences, especially those in Paris who saw the force of Steel Pulse and the force of Bob Marley play on the same bill, enabled us to sell out shows every time since then.

Steel Pulse headlined its own tour in 1978 and released two more singles from the album: &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; and &quot;Prediction.&quot; Mykaell Riley left the band because of musical differences and went on to success with the Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra and as producer for a number of top artists and TV themes. His departure propelled Hinds into the spotlight and in an attempt to draw a stronger black audience, the group adopted the banner of the Rastafari movement. Appearances on television included mainstream shows like Top of the Pops and Rock Goes to College. At one of their &#x27;Rock Against Racism&#x27; appearances, in Victoria Park, East London in April 1978, more than 80,000 people watched a concert that also included The Clash, Tom Robinson Band and X-Ray Spex.

A live performance of the track &quot;Macka Splaff&quot; appeared on a 1978 Virgin Records compilation album called &quot;Live at the Electric Circus&quot;, alongside offerings by The Fall, Joy Division, Buzzcocks and John Cooper Clarke.

<text>The (&quot;Belgian Radio-television of the French Community&quot;), shortened to RTBF (branded as rtbf.be), is a public service broadcaster for the French-speaking Community of Belgium. Its counterpart in the Flemish Community is the Dutch-language VRT (), and in the German-speaking Community it is BRF ().

The RTBF operates five television channels (, , , and ) together with a number of radio channels, including , , , , , and .

The organisation&#x27;s headquarters in Brussels, which is shared with VRT, is sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;Reyers&quot;. This comes from the name of the avenue where the RTBF/VRT&#x27;s main building is located, the /.

== History ==
Originally named the Belgian National Broadcasting Institute (; ), the state-owned broadcasting organisation was established by law on 18 June 1930, and from 1938 was housed in the Flagey Building, also known as the &quot;Radio House&quot;, a purpose-built building in the &quot;paquebot&quot; style of Art Deco architecture.

On 14 June 1940, the INR was forced to cease broadcasting as a result of the German invasion. The German occupying forces, who now oversaw its management, changed the INR&#x27;s name to &#x27;. A number of INR personnel were able to relocate to the BBC&#x27;s studios in London from where they broadcast as &quot; / &quot; under the &#x27; (RNB) established by the Belgian government in exile&#x27;s Ministry of Information.

At the end of the war the INR and the RNB coexisted until 14 September 1945, when a Royal Decree merged the two and restored the INR&#x27;s original mission. The INR was one of 23 broadcasting organisations that founded the European Broadcasting Union in 1950. Television broadcasting from Brussels began in 1953, with two hours of programming each day. In 1960 the INR was subsumed into the RTB (&#x27;) and moved to new quarters at the Reyers building in 1967. The RTB&#x27;s first broadcast in colour, &#x27; (a gardening and nature programme), was transmitted in 1971. Two years later, the RTB began broadcasting news in colour.

In 1977, broadcasting became a concern for Belgium&#x27;s language communities, rather than the national government as a whole. Accordingly, the French-language section of the RTB became the RTBF (&#x27;) and a second television channel was set up with the name . In 1979 became . Along with French channels , , and Swiss channel TSR, the RTBF jointly established the European French-speaking channel in 1984. On 21 March 1988, became . On 27 September 1989 a joint-venture company of the RTBF and Vivendi was set up with the name , which subsequently became &#x27; in May 1995. In 1993, was replaced by and .

In mid-January 2010, the RTBF adopted the new branding of RTBF.be in its main logo. The change was made because of the growing importance of new media; the &quot;.be&quot; suffix stressed those new developments.

On 11 June 2013, the RTBF was one of the few European public broadcasters to join in condemning the closure of Greece&#x27;s public broadcaster, ERT.

By 2011, the analogue systems for RTBF.be were planned to be phased out for Wallonia.

===&quot;Bye Bye Belgium&quot;===
On 13 December 2006, at 20:21 CET (19:21 UTC), the RTBF replaced an edition of its regular current affairs programme &quot;&quot; with a fake special news report in which it was claimed that Flanders had proclaimed independence, effectively dissolving the Belgian state. The programme had been preceded by a caption reading &quot;This may not be fiction&quot;, which was repeated intermittently as a subtitle to the images on the screen. After the first half-hour of the 90-minute broadcast, however – by which point RTBF.be&#x27;s response line had been flooded with calls – this was replaced with a caption reading &quot;This is fiction&quot;.

The video featured images of news reporters standing in front of the Flemish Parliament, while Flemish separatists waved the flag of Flanders behind them. Off to the side, Francophone and Belgian nationalists were waving Belgian flags. The report also featured footage of King Albert and Queen Paola getting on a military jet to Congo, a former Belgian colony.

The RTBF justified the hoax on the grounds that it raised the issue of Flemish nationalism, but others felt that it raised the issue of how much the public can trust the press.

==Editorial independence==
, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the RTBF to be &quot;Independent State Funded and State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

===Controversies===
In September 2024, French Community of Belgium Minister of Media Jacqueline Galant criticized RTBF for airing a segment titled &quot;How to be less racist?&quot;, which in her opinion was biased and lacked pluralism. Galant was in turn criticized by the European Federation of Journalists for alleged editorial interference.

RTBF notably caused controversy in January 2025 by delaying the broadcast of Donald Trump&#x27;s second inaugural speech by two minutes, in order to prevent the live broadcast of statements inciting hatred. The decision was condemned as censorship by Reformist Movement party leader Georges-Louis Bouchez and prompted an investigation from Galant.

<text>The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) () is a commercial semi-state company in Ireland responsible for the regulation of safety aspects of air travel. Its head office is in The Times Building in Dublin.

==Background==
The authority regulates the safety standards of Irish civil aviation. The authority was originally established on 1 January 1994 under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. The new IAA was established on 30 April 2023.

==ANSP functions until 30 April 2023==
Until 30 April 2023, the IAA was also responsible for providing air traffic control services to Ireland&#x27;s three main airports, namely Dublin, Shannon and Cork, and en-route air traffic control services over Irish airspace. On that date, the ANSP (Air Navigation Service Provider) section of the IAA became a separate organisation, 
Irish Air Navigation Service, trading as AirNav Ireland or , which now provides air traffic management and aeronautical communications services in Irish controlled airspace. 

From 30 April 2023, the IAA (merged with the Commission for Aviation Regulation) remains as the civil aviation authority of Ireland, retaining the name Irish Aviation Authority.

==Background of the IAA from 1994 to 2023==

The authority controlled air traffic for the three major international airports in Ireland.
*Shannon – The majority of air traffic controllers in Ireland work in the Shannon ATC centre. It is from here that 80% of all flights transiting between Europe and North America are controlled. These are flights that don&#x27;t touch down on Irish soil. Shannon controls these flights as far as 15 degrees west, approximately 385 kilometres off the Irish coast. From here they are handed over to Shanwick for their journey across the Atlantic Ocean.
*Dublin – There are approximately 79 air traffic controllers in Dublin. The vertical limit of Dublin&#x27;s airspace is Flight Level 245 (24,500 ft). Dublin Airport is by far the busiest airport in Ireland. Estimates for 2017 show 29.6 million passengers going through the airport.
*Cork – Cork ATC provides an approach and an aerodrome service to traffic arriving and departing Cork. The Cork Control Zone has a radius of and a vertical limit of .
The smaller airports such as Ireland West Airport provide their own approach and aerodrome service.

In recent years, the authority has invested more than €115 million in air traffic control systems. This includes a new air traffic control centre (ATCC) at Ballycasey Cross, Shannon. Built on a Greenfield site, this ATCC became fully operational in February 2004 and replaces the ATC Centre at Shannon Airport which had been in operation since 1966. The new ATC centre houses the Shannon element of the new Air Traffic Management (ATM) system introduced in Shannon and Dublin in 2004.

The authority was also responsible for providing communications in Shanwick airspace, with NATS providing the ATC from Prestwick. Shannon Aeradio, as it is known, is based in Ballygirreen, Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare.

In October 2009, it was announced that the regulatory aspects of the IAA&#x27;s remit would be transferred to the Dublin Transport Authority, later renamed the National Transport Authority. However, this plan never went ahead.

In July 2015, the Irish government revealed plans to purchase a long-range radar system at a cost of €10 million for the Irish Aviation Authority and Irish Defence Forces (military) to keep track of covert aircraft flying in Irish-controlled airspace, including military aircraft that do not file a flight plan and do not have their transponders switched on. Minister for Defence Simon Coveney said the increased surveillance capability would give better coverage of the Atlantic airspace over which the IAA has responsibility for civil and military aircraft.

The safety and regulatory division and the air navigation services of the IAA were split into two separate organisations on 30 April 2023. The Safety and Regulatory Division of the IAA merged with the Commission for Aviation Regulation to become the new Irish Aviation Authority. The air navigation service provider functions of the IAA were transferred to a new ANSP called AirNav Ireland.

<doc id="585352" wikidata="Q3269746" url="?curid=585352" title="Battle of Parwan">
<text>The Battle of Parwan was fought between Sultan Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu of the Khwarazmian Empire and the Mongols ruled by Genghis Khan in September 1221 AD at Parwan, north of Kabul, in present-day Afghanistan. Jalal ad-Din had previously attacked a detachment of Mongols near Wilan (Waliyan), which provoked Genghis Khan into sending an army of 30,000 troops under Shigi Qutuqu. As a result of the tactics adopted by Jalal ad-Din, the Mongol army was destroyed in a two-day battle. As news of the Mongol defeat spread, several cities, including Merv and Herat, which had previously surrendered and accepted Mongol rule, rebelled. In response, Genghis Khan moved to battle Jalal ad-Din, who had lost half of his troops to desertion due to a quarrel over the division of spoils after the battle, and was forced to move to Ghazni to prepare to retreat to India. Genghis Khan intercepted Jalal ad-Din&#x27;s army as he was preparing to cross the Indus River, and in the ensuing battle he lost his army, treasury and family, but survived to eventually establish a power base in Punjab and Sindh.

== Background ==

Genghis Khan invaded the Khwarazmian Empire to avenge the murder of a Mongol trade caravan by the government of Otrar and the subsequent refusal of Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad II to bring the governor of Otrar to task for his crime. Genghis Khan commanded a skilled, disciplined, combat-proven army of 150,000 to 200,000 soldiers, mostly Mongols and other allied tribes who were well-drilled in their method of warfare. The army also included a corps of Chinese siege engineers. Genghis Khan was a charismatic, inelegant and experienced leader, his sons Jochi, Chagatai, Ogedei and Tolui were competent generals, and he was also served by brilliant generals like Jebe and Subutai, adept in employing flexible and innovative tactics.

Shah Muhammad II may have been able to mobilize a mercenary army numbering 200,000 to 400,000 men, but his Turkish soldiers were undisciplined, and unity was lacking between the Turks, Iranians, Arabs and Afghans in the army. The mistrust that the Shah had for his Qanqli Turk troops and commanders meant he could only offer battle under favorable conditions with superior numbers. He adopted a defence in depth strategy based on fortified cities, and stationed garrisons of veteran soldiers at various cities including Otrar, Bukhara, Banakat and Samarkand, trusting to the Mongol inexperience with siegecraft and their unfamiliarity with the terrain to delay their progress and give him the chance to offer battle at his own initiative. He planned to raise a new army beyond the Amu Darya near Kelif and then strike the Mongols in Transoxania, or defend the Amu Darya barrier by preventing the Mongols from crossing the river, and if needed retreat to Ghazni and then to India.

Genghis Khan invested Otrar with his entire field army in September 1219. After some time, he divided his army, sending a detachment under his eldest son Jochi down the Syr Darya, and another division to march on Banakat. Leaving Chagatai and Ogedei to maintain the siege of Otrar, Genghis Khan and Tolui crossed the Kyzylkum Desert to attack Bukhara, which fell in February 1220, and Samarkand, which was taken in March 1220. Banakat was also occupied, Otrar fell in April 1220, and the Mongol armies from Banakat and Otrar joined Genghis Khan near Nasaf, where they spent the summer of 1220 resting the army and the horses. Jochi had taken all the towns along Syr Darya, including Sighnaq and Jend, by April 1220, then camped on the Kipchak steppes. Genghis Khan sent a 30,000–40,000 man army led by Jebe and Subutai and his own son-in-law Toghachar to hunt down the Shah.

The rapid fall of Transoxania further unnerved Shah Muhammad II, who began to retreat west along with Jalal al-Din. He had halted for a while at Nishapur, but when the Mongol army under Jebe and Subutai crossed the Amu Darya, the Shah moved across Persia, then eluded the Mongols by pretending to make for Baghdad, and eventually found refuge on an island in the Caspian Sea, where he died in December 1220, naming Jalal ad-Din his heir. The Mongol army sacked several cities, including Zaveh, Quchan, Tus, Qazvin and Ardabil, and then wintered in the Mughan steppes.

Jalal al-Din needed an army to confront the Mongols. The Sultan went to Gurganj, a city reportedly housing 90,000 troops, but the city officials preferred his brother Uzlaq Shah as the Sultan. After discovering a plot against his life, the Sultan with 300 cavalry crossed the Karakum Desert in 16 days and defeated a Mongol detachment near Nisa to reach Nishapur. Jalal al-Din intended to raise an army at Nishapur, but abandoned the city when Mongols arrived unexpectedly. The Mongols chased the Sultan across Khuistan, but Jalal al-Din managed to elude his enemies to reach Bost. Here, an army of 10,000 Turks commanded by his maternal uncle Amin Malik joined him, and the Sultan reached Ghazni after driving off a Mongol army from Qanhahar after a three-day battle.

===Prelude===

Jalal al-Din spent the summer of 1221 in Ghazni where thousands of people from all over Afghanistan joined his ranks to defend their homelands after hearing the fate of Bamiyan. He assembled a coalition of Afghan and Turkic warriors. From there, he went first to Valiyan, which was under siege by the Mongols, defeated their two armies under the leaderships of Tekejik and Molger, and lifted the siege of Valiyan, with about 1,000 Mongol casualties. Jalal ad-Din regrouped at Parwan. A week later, Genghis Khan sent his chief justice Shigi Qutuqu to hunt down Jalal al-Din, but only gave the inexperienced general 30,000–50,000 troops.

Medieval scholarship differed on the strength of the Mongol army. Ata Malik Juvayni reported Shigi Qutuqu&#x27;s strengths as 30,000, Juzjani reported it as 45,000, and Ibn Abd Allah al-Umari reported it as 70,000. Juzjani, Nasawi, Juvayni, Ibn al-Athir and Handmir all report the Khwarazmian strength as 60,000.

However, modern scholarship differs on the strength of both armies. The lowest estimate for Jalal al-Din&#x27;s strength is 30,000, while the highest is 120,000. In &quot;The Harper Encyclopedia of Military History&quot;, Richard and Trevor Dupuy give Jalal al-Din&#x27;s force as 120,000. Tucker similarly gives Jalal al-Din&#x27;s strength as 120,000.

Estimates for Shigi Qutuqu&#x27;s strength range between 30,000 and 70,000. Mclynn Frank estimates the Mongol forces were around 45,000–50,000, whereas he estimates Jalal al-Din had 60,000–70,000; he further adds that while the numbers are exaggerated, the proportion of Jalal al Din&#x27;s army&#x27;s numerical superiority is probably accurate. On the other hand, Carl Sverdrup assesses that Jalal al-Din probably had 15,000 men in total whereas Shigi Qutuqu commanded as many as 10,000 men. The larger Khwarazmian army was ill-equipped and consisted mostly of infantry, whereas Shigi Qutuqu&#x27;s entire army was well-equipped cavalry.

== Battle ==
Shigi Qutuqu was overconfident after the continuous Mongol successes, and he quickly found himself on the back foot against the more numerous Khwarazmian force. The battle took place in a narrow valley, which was unsuitable for the Mongol cavalry.

Jalal al-Din had mounted archers, whom he ordered to dismount and fire on the Mongols. Jalal al-Din gave Saif al-Din Ighraq command of the left flank and Malik Khan the right flank, consisting of 10,000 soldiers. On the first day of the battle, Malik Khan&#x27;s division pushed the Mongol left into their base. Because of the narrow terrain, the Mongols could not use their normal tactics. On the second day of the battle, to deceive the Khwarazmians, Shigi Qutuqu mounted straw warriors on spare remounts, which may have spared him from a killing stroke, but Jalal al-Din was not fooled by the ruse. On the third day, the Mongol right flank charged on Ighraq&#x27;s division, and Ighraq&#x27;s division responded by shooting arrows on foot to which the Mongols feigned flight. Ighraq&#x27;s men charged, but 500 were killed when the Mongols suddenly counter-attacked. Seeing this, Jalal al-Din personally attacked the Mongols and forced them to flight. Large numbers of the Mongols were captured alive, and the Khwarazmians killed them by nailing stakes into their ears. Shigi Qutuqu was driven off in defeat, losing over half his army.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
According to Ibn Al-Athir&#x27;s account, after the battle of Parwan was won, Jalal al-Din sent a message to Genghis Khan, stating:

Genghis Khan responded by sending a larger army under the leadership of one of his sons. Jalal al-Din confronted the new army when the army arrived at Kabul and the Mongols were defeated again. Carl Sverdrup on the other hand talks of 2 battles following the Battle of Parwan, 1 battle between a Khwarezmian army led by a general named Orkhan in which Khwarezmians were defeated and second battle between a Mongol general Caqan and Jalal al-Din in which Jalal al-Din triumphed. Sverdrup also mentions that &quot;there might have been more than one action.&quot;

Regardless of whether those battles occurred or not, both contemporary and medieval scholarship agree that in the evening of the day the battle ended, a dispute over the division of the spoils, specifically a Mongolian white horse, led to the desertion of the Afghan contingent. Amin Malik, leader of the Turks and the Sultan&#x27;s father-in-law, struck Saif al-Din Ighraq, leader of the Afghans, with a whip. Sultan Jalal ad-Din refused to discipline Amin Malik, and Ighraq reproached the Sultan, and he along with the Khalaj, Afghan, and some of the Qanqli troops deserted after nightfall.

Jalal ad-Din left Parwan for the Punjab with only 30,000 men after the Afghans abandoned him. When Genghis Khan heard the news of the defeats, he made forced marches to catch Jalal al-Din before he escaped into India. Genghis marched with Shigi Qutugu and instructed him on where he had gone wrong on the battleground. The Shah attempted to cross the Indus River to the area north of the present city of Kalabagh, Pakistan. However, the Mongols caught up with him on the banks of the Indus and defeated him, in what is now referred to as the Battle of the Indus.

The Battle of Parwan is considered a significant battle, as it is considered the resurrection of the Khwarazmians and the first serious defeat of the Mongols against the Khwarezmians. Medieval contemporary Muslim accounts all hailed this victory. According to Rashid al-Din Hamadani&#x27;s account, Genghis Khan personally visited the battlefield and the fallen Mongol soldiers, and addressing Shigi Qutuqu, said:

The Khwarezmians started an insurgency after the news of Shigi Qutuqu&#x27;s defeat at the battle of Parwan spread throughout the empire. Inspired by Jalal al-Din&#x27;s back-to-back victories against the Mongol army, Kush Tegin Pahlawan led an insurgency in Merv and seized it successfully, followed by a successful attack on Bukhara. People in Herat also rebelled and disposed the Mongol vassal leadership. An insurgency leader named Muhammad the Marghani twice attacked Genghis Khan&#x27;s camp at Baghlan and returned with loot. As a response, Genghis Khan sent a large army under the leadership of Oghedei Khan back to Ghazni. The Battle of Parwan had grave repercussions in Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Iran since the illusion of Mongol invincibility had been broken. Cities that had peacefully surrendered rose up in arms, which forced Genghis and his son Tolui to spend extra months subduing the revolts. Genghis Khan appointed Yelü Ahai to restore Mongol sovereignty in Samarqand and Bukhara; he managed to restore order in the cities in 1223.

<text>A plastic model kit, ( in Eastern influenced parlance), is a consumer-grade plastic scale model manufactured as a , primarily assembled by hobbyists, and intended primarily for display. A plastic model kit depicts various subjects, ranging from real life military and civilian vehicles to characters and machinery from original kit lines and pop fiction, especially from eastern pop culture. A kit varies in difficulty, ranging from a &quot;snap-together&quot; model that assembles straight from the box, to a kit that requires special tools, paints, and plastic cements.

==Subjects==

The most popular subjects of plastic models by far are vehicles such as aircraft, ships, automobiles, and armored vehicles such as tanks. The majority of models throughout its early history depict military vehicles, due to the wider variety of form and historical context compared to civilian vehicles. Other subjects include science fiction vehicles and mecha, real spacecraft, buildings, animals, human(oid) dolls/action figures, and characters from pop culture.

While military, ship, and aircraft modelers prize accuracy above all, modelers of automobiles and science-fiction themes may attempt to duplicate an existing subject, or may depict a completely imaginary subject. The creation of custom automobile models is related to the creation of actual custom cars and often an individual may have an interest in both, although the cost of customizing a real car is obviously enormously greater than that of customizing a model.

==Construction and techniques==
The first plastic models were injection molded in cellulose acetate (e.g. Frog Penguin and Varney Trains), but currently most plastic models are injection-molded in polystyrene, and the parts are bonded together, usually with a plastic solvent-based adhesive, although experienced modelers may also use epoxy, cyanoacrylate, and white glue where their particular properties would be advantageous. While often omitted by novice modellers, specially formulated paint is sold for application to plastic models. Complex markings such as aircraft insignia or automobile body decorative details and model identification badges are typically provided with kits as screen-printed water-slide decals.
Recently, models requiring less skill, time, and/or effort have been marketed, targeted to younger or less skilled modelers as well as those who just wish to reduce the time and effort required to complete a model. One such trend has been to offer a fully detailed kit requiring normal assembly and gluing, but eliminate the often frustrating task of painting the kit by molding it out of colored plastic, or by supplying it pre-painted and with decals applied. Often these kits are identical to another kit supplied in normal white or gray plastic except for the colored plastic or the prepainting, thus eliminating the large expense of creating another set of molds.

Another trend which has become very extensive is to produce kits where the parts snap together, with no glue needed; sometimes the majority of the parts snap together with a few requiring glue. Often there is some simplification of detail as well; for instance, automotive kits without opening hoods and no engine detail, or sometimes opaque windows with no interior detail. These are often supplied in colored plastic, although smaller details would still require painting. Decals are usually not supplied with these but sometimes vinyl stickers are provided for insignia and similar details.

Resin casting and vacuum forming are also used to produce models, or particular parts where the scale of production is not such as to support the investment required for injection molding.

Plastic ship model kits typically provide thread in several sizes and colors for the rigging. Automobile kits typically contain vinyl tires, although sometimes these are molded from polystyrene as well, particularly in very inexpensive kits. Thin metal details produced by photoetching have become popular relatively recently, both as detailing parts manufactured and sold by small businesses, and as parts of a complete kit. Detail parts of other materials are sometimes included in kits or sold separately, such as metal tubing to simulate exhaust systems, or vinyl tubing to simulate hoses or wiring.

==Scales==
Almost all plastic models are designed in a well-established scale. Each type of subject has one or more common scales, though they differ from one to the other. The general aim is to allow the finished model to be of a reasonable size, while maintaining consistency across models for collections. The following are the most common scales for popular subjects:

* Aircraft: 1/24, 1/32, 1/48, 1/72, 1/100, and 1/144. The most popular scales are 1/48 and 1/72.
* Military vehicles: 1/16, 1/24, 1/32, 1/35, 1/48, 1/72, and 1/76.
* Automobiles: 1/8, 1/12, 1/16, 1/18, 1/20, 1/24, 1/25, 1/32, 1/35, and 1/43.
* Ships: 1/72, 1/96, 1/144, 1/200, 1/350, 1/400 1/450, 1/600, and 1/700.
* Figures: 1/72, 1/48, 1/35, 1/24, 1/16, 1/13, 1/8, 1/6, and 1/4. The smaller scale figures are usually used in dioramas; the larger scales (1/8 and 1/6) are popular for stand-alone subjects.
* Figurine busts: 1/12, 1/10, 1/9
* Railways: 1:43.5 (7 mm/1 ft : O scale), 1:76.2 (4 mm/1 ft : OO scale), 1:87 (3.5 mm/1 ft : HO scale)
* Mecha: 1/144, 1/100, 1/72, 1/60, and 1/35.
In reality, models do not always conform to their nominal scale; there are 1/25 scale automobile models which are larger than some 1/24 scale models, for instance. For example, the engine in the recent reissue of the AMT &quot;Ala Kart&quot; show truck is significantly smaller than the engine in the original issue. AMT employees from the 1960s note that, at that time, all AMT kits were packaged into boxes of a standardized size, to simplify shipping; and the overriding requirement of designing any kit was that it had to fit into that precise size of box, no matter how large or small the original vehicle. This practice was common for other genres and manufacturers of models as well. In modern times this practice has become known as fit-the-box scale. In practice, this means that kits of the same subject in nominally identical scales may produce finished models which actually differ in size, and that hypothetically identical parts in such kits may not be easily swapped between them, even when the kits are both by the same manufacturer.

The shape of the model may not entirely conform to the subject, as well; reviews of kits in modeling magazines often comment on how well the model depicts the original.

==History==
The first plastic models were manufactured at the end of 1936 by Frog in the UK, with a range of 1/72nd scale model kits called &#x27;Penguin&#x27;. In the late 1940s several American companies such as Hawk, Varney, Empire, Renwal and Lindberg began to produce plastic models. Many manufacturers began production in the 1950s and gained ascendancy in the 1960s such as Aurora, Revell, AMT, and Monogram in America, Airfix in UK and Heller SA in France. Other manufacturers included; Matchbox (UK), Italeri, ESCI, (both Italian) Novo {ex-Frog moulds} (former Soviet Union), and Fujimi, Nichimo and Bandai (Japan).

American model companies who had been producing assembled promotional scale models of new automobiles each year for automobile dealers found a lucrative side business selling the unassembled parts of these &quot;promos&quot; to hobbyists to assemble, thus finding a new revenue stream for the injection molds which were so expensive to update each year. These early models were typically lower in detail than currently standard, with non-opening hoods and no engines, and simplified or no detail on the chassis, which attached to the body with very visible screws. Within a short time, the kit business began to overshadow the production of promos, and the level of accuracy and detail was raised to satisfy the demands of the marketplace.

In the 1960s, Tamiya manufactured aircraft kits in the peculiar (at the time) scale of 1/100. Although the range included famous aircraft such as the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, North American F-86 Sabre, Dassault Mirage III, Grumman A-6 Intruder and the LTV A-7 Corsair II, it never enjoyed the same success as 1/72 scale kits did. Soon, Tamiya stopped manufacturing 1/100 scale aircraft but re-issued a small selection of them in 2004.

Since the 1970s, Japanese firms such as Hasegawa and Tamiya, and since the 1990s also Chinese firms such as DML, AFV Club and Trumpeter have dominated the field and represent the highest level of technology. Brands from Russia, Central Europe, and Korea have also become prominent recently with companies like Academy Plastic Model. Many smaller companies have also produced plastic models, both in the past and currently.

Prior to the rise of plastic models, shaped wood models were offered to model builders. These wood model kits often required extensive work to create results easily obtained by the plastic models.

With the development of new technologies, modeling hobby can also be practiced in the virtual world. The Model Builder game, produced by Moonlit studio, available on Steam (service), consists of cutting, assembling, and painting airplanes, helicopters, tanks, cars, and others and making dioramas with them. Transferring the hobby to the game world allows novice modelers and people who do not have space, time, or money to buy multiple models to pursue their interests. Another form of practicing in the virtual world is a 3D modeling with the use of such software like Blender, FreeCAD, Lego Digital Designer (superseded by BrickLink Studio) or LeoCAD, etc.

==Manufacture==
While injection-molding is the predominant manufacturing process for plastic models, the high costs of equipment and making molds make it unsuitable for lower-yield production. Thus, models of minor and obscure subjects are often manufactured using alternative processes. Vacuum forming is popular for aircraft models, though assembly is more difficult than for injection-molded kits. Early manufacturers of vacuum formed model kits included Airmodel (the former DDR), Contrail, Airframe (Canada), Formaplane, and Rareplanes (UK). Resin-casting, popular with smaller manufacturers, particularly aftermarket firms (but also producers of full kits), yields a greater degree of detail moulded in situ, but as the moulds used don&#x27;t last as long, the price of such kits is considerably higher. In recent times, the latest releases from major manufacturers offer unprecedented detail that is a match for the finest resin kits, often including high-quality mixed-media (photo-etched brass, turned aluminum) parts.

== Variations ==
Many modellers build dioramas as landscaped scenes built around one or more models. They are most common for military vehicles such as tanks, but airfield scenes and 2-3 ships in formation are also popular.

Conversions use a kit as a starting point, and modify it to be something else. For instance, kits of the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;) are readily available, but the &quot;Constitution&quot; was just one of six sister ships, and an ambitious modeller will modify the kit, by sawing, filing, adding pieces, and so forth, to make a model of one of the others.

Scratch building is the creation of a model &quot;from scratch&quot; rather than a manufactured kit. True scratchbuilt models consist of parts made by hand and do not incorporate parts from other kits. These are rare. When parts from other kits are included, the art is technically called &quot;Kit Bashing.&quot; Most pieces referred to as &quot;scratchbuilt&quot; are actually a combination of kit bashing and scratchbuilding. Thus, it has become common for either term to be used loosely to refer to these more common hybrid models.

Kitbashing is a modelling technique where parts from multiple model kits are combined to create a novel model form. For example, the effects crews on the various Star Trek TV shows frequently kitbashed multiple starship models to quickly create new classes of ship for use in background scenes where details would not be particularly obvious.

==Issues==
The demographics of plastic modeling have changed in its half-century of existence, from young boys buying them as toys to older adults building them to assemble large collections. In the United States, as well as some other countries, many modelers are former members of the military who like to recreate the actual equipment they used in service.

Technological advances have made model-building more and more sophisticated, and the proliferation of expensive detailing add-ons have raised the bar for competition within modeling clubs. As a result, a kit built &quot;out of the box&quot; on a weekend cannot compare with a kit built over months where a tiny add-on part such as an aircraft seat can cost more than the entire kit itself.

Though plastic modeling is generally an uncontroversial hobby, it&#x27;s not immune to social pressures:
* In the 1990s, various countries banned Formula One race cars from carrying advertising for tobacco sponsors. In response, manufacturers such as Tamiya removed tobacco logo decals from their race car kits, even those of cars which appeared before the tobacco ban.
* The Nazi swastika, which appears on World War 2 Luftwaffe aircraft, is illegal to display in Germany, and disappeared from almost all manufacturers&#x27; box illustrations in the 1990s. Some makers still include the emblem on the decal sheet, others have &quot;broken&quot; it into two elements which must be reassembled by the builder, while others have omitted it altogether. Aftermarket decal sheets exist that consist entirely of Luftwaffe swastikas.
* A long lasting legal conflict exists between aerospace corporations and the manufacturers of plastic models. Manufacturers of aircraft have sought royalties from model makers for using their designs and intellectual property in their kits. Hobbyists argue that model kits provide free advertising for the makers of the real vehicles and that any royalties collected would be insignificant compared to the profits made from aircraft construction contracts. They also argue that forcing manufacturers to pay royalties and licensing fees would financially ruin all but the largest model kit makers. Some proponents of the aerospace industry contest that the issue is not of financial damages, but of intellectual property and brand image. In contrast, most of the world&#x27;s commercial airlines allow their fleet to be modeled, as a form of publicity. Many cottage industry manufacturers, particularly of sci-fi subjects, avoid the issue by selling their products under generic untrademarked names (e.g. selling a figure that clearly depicts Batman as &quot;Bat Hero Figure&quot;). Similarly, automobile manufacturers occasionally make an effort to collect royalties from companies modeling their products.
* The UK&#x27;s Ministry of Defence prohibits use of its logos and insignias on commercial products without permission, and according to its licensing policy model and decal manufacturers are required to pay a license fee in order to use Royal Air Force insignia or insignias and logos of any other military unit that was or is a sub-unit of the UK&#x27;s MOD.

<doc id="585360" wikidata="Q4686290" url="?curid=585360" title="Advanced Tactical Fighter">
<text>The Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) was a program undertaken by the United States Air Force to develop a next-generation air superiority fighter to replace the F-15 Eagle in order to counter emerging worldwide threats in the 1980s, including Soviet Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29 fighters under development, Beriev A-50 airborne warning and control systems (AWACS), and increasingly sophisticated surface-to-air missile systems. 

The ATF would make a leap in performance and capability by taking advantage of emerging technologies, including advanced avionics and flight control systems, more powerful propulsion systems, and stealth technology. Lockheed and Northrop were selected in 1986 to respectively develop the YF-22 and YF-23 technology demonstrator prototype aircraft, the associated avionics prototypes, and the system specification for the program&#x27;s Demonstration and Validation (Dem/Val) phase; the prototype aircraft were flight tested in 1990. 

After evaluations, the Lockheed team was selected in 1991 for ATF full-scale development, or Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). The Lockheed team then developed the F-22 Raptor, which first flew in 1997, for production and operational service. The U.S. Navy considered using a naval version of the ATF (called NATF) as a replacement for the F-14 Tomcat, but these plans were later canceled due to costs.

==Background==
Although the term &quot;Advanced Tactical Fighter&quot; (ATF) appeared in U.S. Air Force (USAF) parlance as far back as 1971 to describe potential future tactical aircraft, the program that would eventually result in the F-22 began in 1981. This was motivated by the shift in U.S. military doctrine towards striking the enemy&#x27;s rear echelon as eventually outlined in the AirLand Battle concept, as well as intelligence reports of multiple emerging worldwide threats emanating from the Soviet Union. Between 1977 and 1979, American satellite photographs of the &quot;&quot;Ram-K&quot; and &quot;Ram-L&quot;&quot; fighter prototypes at Ramenskoye air base in Zhukovsky—later identified as the Su-27 &quot;Flanker&quot; and the MiG-29 &quot;Fulcrum&quot; respectively—indicated that a new generation of Soviet fighter aircraft comparable to the recently introduced F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon would soon enter service.

Also concerning were Soviet reports of &quot;look-down/shoot-down&quot; capability being introduced on an advanced MiG-25 derivative, later revealed to be the MiG-31 &quot;Foxhound&quot;, as well as the appearance of an Il-76-based airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft called the A-50 &quot;Mainstay&quot;; these systems, revealed in 1978, greatly reduced the effectiveness and survivability of low-altitude penetration. Furthermore, experience and data from the Vietnam War and the more recent 1973 Arab-Israeli war demonstrated the increasing lethality and sophistication of Soviet surface-to-air missile systems.

==Program history==
===Concept development===

In 1981, USAF began forming requirements for the ATF, eventually codenamed &quot;Senior Sky&quot;. In May, a request for information (RFI) was published by the USAF Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD), followed by another RFI for the ATF propulsion systems in June. Design concepts were provided by defense contractors and analyzed by the ASD, which released their final report in December 1982. During this time, the ASD also established an internal ATF Concept Development Team in October 1982 to manage concept development studies. As the ATF was still early in its requirements definition, including whether the aircraft should be focused on air-to-air or air-to-surface, there was great variety in the RFI responses; the submitted designs generally fell into four concepts.

* &quot;Numbers Fighter&quot; (N): Lightweight, low-cost design trading lower individual capability for quantity.
* &quot;Supersonic Cruise and Maneuver&quot; (SCM): Approximately takeoff weight fighter with high maneuverability and specific excess power at transonic and supersonic speeds.
* &quot;Subsonic Low Observable&quot; (SLO): An internal ASD concept that sacrificed fighter-like performance and speed for low radar cross-section and infrared signature.
* &quot;High-Mach/High-Altitude&quot; (HI): Large and fast missileer aircraft over at takeoff intended to operate well above Mach 2 and .

Further analysis by ASD would indicate that the best air-to-surface concept was &quot;SLO&quot;, while the best air-to-air concept was &quot;SCM&quot;; neither &quot;N&quot; nor &quot;HI&quot; were rated highly, and responses from contractors also broadly agreed on avoiding either extremes of the quality-versus-quantity spectrum. Even with the variety of the submitted designs in the responses, the common areas among some or all the concepts were reduced observability, or stealth (though not to the extent of the final requirements), short takeoff and landing (STOL) and sustained supersonic cruise without afterburners, or supercruise. It was envisioned that the ATF would incorporate emerging technologies including advanced alloys and composite material, advanced avionics and fly-by-wire flight control systems, higher power propulsion systems, and low-observable, or stealth technology.
By October 1983, the ATF Concept Development Team had become the System Program Office (SPO) led by Colonel Albert C. Piccirillo at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. After discussions with Tactical Air Command (TAC), the CDT/SPO determined that the ATF should focus on air-to-air missions; the air-to-surface missions would be handled by the upgraded F-111, the upcoming Dual-Role Fighter (DRF) (which would result in the F-15E Strike Eagle) as well as the then-classified F-117 Nighthawk (&quot;Senior Trend&quot;), while the air-to-air threat from the new Soviet fighters and AWACS remained. Additionally, as with ASD and industry responses, TAC did not want the ATF to be at either extremes of the quality-versus-quantity spectrum. Thus, the ATF would be a new air superiority fighter in the vein of the SCM concept with outstanding aerodynamic performance, and intended to replace the capability of the F-15 Eagle; in the potential scenario of a Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in Central Europe, the ATF was envisaged to support the air-land battle by performing offensive and defensive counter-air missions against the Soviet air-to-air threats that would then allow the DRF and other strike aircraft to perform air interdiction against ground targets.

With the ATF&#x27;s mission now focused on air-to-air, another round of requests were sent to the industry for concept exploration and study contracts were awarded to seven airframe manufacturers for further definition of their designs. A request for proposals (RFP) for the fighter&#x27;s engine, initially called the Joint Advanced Fighter Engine (JAFE) due to its potential joint application with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s short-lived Advanced Carrier-Based Multirole Fighter (VFMX), was released in May 1983. Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric each received $202 million contracts (~$ in ) for the development and production of prototype engines in September 1983. Avionics were also expected to be a major component of the ATF in light of rapidly advancing semiconductor technology; requests for advanced avionics components such as the integrated electronic warfare system were sent out that November.

During this time, the SPO took an increasing interest in stealth as results from classified &quot;black world&quot; programs such as the &quot;Have Blue&quot;/F-117, &quot;Tacit Blue&quot;, and the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) program (which would result in the B-2 Spirit, or &quot;Senior Ice&quot;) promised greatly reduced radar cross sections (RCS) that were orders of magnitude smaller than existing aircraft. The ATF requirements would place increasing emphasis on stealth to improve survivability over the course of concept exploration, while still demanding fighter-like speed and maneuverability; the combination of low observables with the SCM concept was expected to greatly reduce the lethal zone of hostile surface-to-air missiles. As a result of stealth technology, the design details became &quot;black&quot; even though the ATF was a publicly acknowledged program. By late 1984, the SPO had settled on the ATF requirements and released the Statement of Operational Need (SON), which called for a fighter with a takeoff gross weight of , a mission radius of mixed subsonic/supersonic or subsonic, supercruise speed of Mach 1.4–1.5, the ability to use a runway, and signature reduction particularly in the frontal sector.

===Request for proposals===
A request for proposals (RFP) for demonstration and validation (Dem/Val) was issued in September 1985, with proposals initially to be due that December. The top four proposals, later reduced to two to reduce program costs, would proceed with Dem/Val. The RFP not only had the ATF&#x27;s demanding technical requirements, but also placed great importance on systems engineering, technology development plans, and risk mitigation; in fact, these areas were deemed more important than the aircraft designs themselves as contractors would later discover in their debriefs after Dem/Val selection. This was because the SPO anticipated that the ATF would need to employ emerging technologies beyond even the contemporary state-of-the-art and did not want a point aircraft design frozen at then-mature technology readiness levels; as such, the SPO needed to evaluate its confidence in a contractor&#x27;s ability to effectively and affordably develop new technology. Initially, there was no requirement for flying prototype air vehicles.

At this time, the SPO had anticipated procuring 750 ATFs at a unit cost of $35 million in fiscal year (FY) 1985 dollars (~$ in ) with final design selection in 1989 and service entry in 1995 with a peak production rate of 72 aircraft per year, although even at this point the peak rate was being questioned and the entry date was at risk of slipping to the late 1990s due to potential RFP adjustments and budget constraints. Shortly afterwards, the Navy under Congressional pressure joined the ATF program initially as an observer to examine the possibility using a navalised derivative, named the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), to replace the F-14 Tomcat; the Navy would eventually announced in 1988 that they would procure 546 aircraft under the NATF program at a peak rate of 48 per year.

The Dem/Val RFP would indeed see some changes after its first release that pushed the due date to July 1986; in December 1985, following discussions with Lockheed and Northrop, the two contractor teams with prior stealth experience from the &quot;Have Blue&quot;/F-117 and ATB/B-2 respectively, all-aspect stealth requirements were drastically increased. Furthermore, the Packard Commission, a federal commission by President Ronald Reagan to study Department of Defense procurement practices, had released its report in February 1986 and one of its recommendations was a &quot;fly-before-buy&quot; competitive procurement strategy that encouraged prototyping. The ATF SPO was pressured to followed the recommendations of the Packard Commission, and in May 1986, the RFP was changed so that final selection would involve flying prototypes. Because of this late addition due to political pressure, the prototype air vehicles were to be &quot;best-effort&quot; machines not meant to perform a competitive flyoff or represent a production aircraft that meets every requirement, but to demonstrate the viability of its concept and mitigate risk. The increased costs associated with aircraft prototyping was also partly why the number of Dem/Val finalists was reduced from four to two.
In July 1986, proposals were provided by Boeing, General Dynamics, Grumman, Lockheed, Northrop, McDonnell Douglas, and North American Rockwell; Grumman and North American Rockwell would drop out shortly afterwards. Because contractors were expected to make immense investments of their own — likely approaching the amount awarded by the contracts themselves when combined — in order to develop the necessary technology to meet the ambitious requirements, teaming was encouraged by the SPO. Following proposal submissions, Lockheed (through its Skunk Works division), Boeing, and General Dynamics formed a team to develop whichever of their proposed designs was selected, if any. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas formed a team with a similar agreement.
On 31 October 1986, Lockheed and Northrop, the two industry leaders in stealth aircraft, were selected as first and second place respectively and would proceed as the finalists. Noteworthy is the divergent approach of the two finalists&#x27; proposals. Northrop&#x27;s proposal leveraged its considerable experience with stealth to produce a refined and well-understood aircraft design that was very similar to the eventual flying prototype. While Lockheed also had extensive prior stealth experience, their actual aircraft design was quite immature and only existed as a rough concept that would be extensively redesigned; instead, Lockheed primarily focused on systems engineering and trade studies in its proposal, which pulled it ahead of Northrop&#x27;s to take top rank. The two teams, Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics and Northrop/McDonnell Douglas, were awarded $691 million firm fixed-price contracts in FY 1985 dollars (~$ in ) and would undertake a 50-month Dem/Val phase, culminating in the flight test of two technology demonstrator prototypes, the YF-22 and the YF-23; Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric would also receive $341 million (~$ in ) each for the development and prototyping of the competing engines (designated YF119 and YF120 respectively), and the JAFE propulsion effort would later be renamed ATF Engine (ATFE) and directly managed by the ATF SPO.

===Demonstration and validation===

The Dem/Val phase was intended to develop and mature ATF technologies that would facilitate the fighter&#x27;s eventual full-scale development and production, and focused on three main activities: requirements and system specification development, avionics ground prototypes and flying laboratories, and prototype air vehicles. During Dem/Val, the ATF SPO program manager was Colonel James A. Fain, while the technical director (or chief engineer) was Eric &quot;Rick&quot; Abell. The director of ATF requirements was Colonel David J. McCloud of TAC, and the draft System Operational Requirements Document (SORD), derived from the 1984 SON, was released in December 1987. In addition to the government contract awards, company investments during Dem/Val would amount to $675 million and $650 million (~$ and ~$ in ) for the Lockheed and Northrop teams respectively, not counting additional investments during prior phases or by subcontractors; Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric would each invest $100 million as well (~$ in ).

With the ATF system specification, the SPO had set the technical requirements without specifying the &quot;how&quot;; this was meant to give the contractor teams flexibility in developing the requisite technologies and offer competing methods. Furthermore, the SPO was also open to adjusting requirements if necessary. Both contractor teams conducted performance and cost trade studies and presented them in system requirement reviews (SRRs) with the SPO periodically during Dem/Val. This enabled the SPO to adjust ATF requirements and delete ones that were significant weight and cost drivers while having marginal operational value. For instance, the number of internal missiles (represented by the AIM-120A) was reduced from eight to six to reduce weight and cost. Because of the added weight for thrust vectoring/reversing nozzles and related systems on the F-15 STOL/MTD research aircraft, the SPO changed the runway length requirement to and removed the thrust reverser requirement in late 1987. The ejection seat requirement was downgraded from a fresh design to the existing McDonnell Douglas ACES II. However, both contractor teams still found the takeoff gross weight goal unachievable, so this was increased to , resulting in engine thrust requirement increasing from class to class. Furthermore, Dem/Val would be extended several times to better mature technologies and reduce near-term budgets.
Aside from advances in air vehicle and propulsion technology, the ATF would make a leap in avionics performance with a fully integrated avionics suite that fuses sensor information together into a common tactical picture, thus improving the pilot&#x27;s situational awareness and reducing workload; the avionics were expected to make up about 40% of the ATF&#x27;s flyaway cost. The avionics system was to employ the &quot;PAVE PILLAR&quot; system architecture and leverage technology from the Very High Speed Integrated Circuit program; software would primarily be written in Ada. The Dem/Val phase for avionics development was marked by demonstrations of the hardware and software with Avionics Ground Prototypes (AGP) to evaluate performance and reliability. The SPO gave the teams flexibility to pick their own vendors for some subsystems; for instance, the Lockheed team&#x27;s infrared search and track (IRST) sensor was supplied by General Electric, while Northrop team&#x27;s was from Martin Marietta; both teams chose the Westinghouse/Texas Instruments active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The integrated electronics warfare and integrated communication, navigation, and identification avionics were selected by the SPO. Although not required, both teams would employ flying avionics laboratories as well, with the Lockheed team using a modified Boeing 757 and the Northrop team using a modified BAC One-Eleven. The avionics requirements were also the subject of SRRs and adjustments; as avionics was a significant cost driver, side-looking radars were deleted, and the dedicated IRST system was downgraded from multicolor to single color before changing from requirement to goal and provision for future addition. In 1989, a $9 million per aircraft cost cap on avionics in FY 1985 dollars (~$ in ) was imposed by the SPO to contain requirements creep.

Finally, two examples of each prototype air vehicles were built and flown for Dem/Val: one with General Electric YF120 engines, the other with Pratt &amp; Whitney YF119 engines. Contractor teams made extensive use of analytical and empirical methods for their air vehicle designs, including wind tunnel testing, RCS pole testing, and software for computational fluid dynamics, RCS calculations, and computer-aided design. Consistent with the SPO&#x27;s willingness to give contractor teams the flexibility in determining how to achieve the ATF requirements, the flight test plans were created and executed by the teams themselves and the prototype air vehicles were not flown against each other for direct comparisons; neither the YF-22 nor YF-23 would share the same test points, which were set by their own teams to demonstrate concept viability and validate engineering predictions. Noteworthy is the Lockheed team&#x27;s complete redesign of the YF-22&#x27;s entire shape and configuration in summer 1987 due to weight concerns, with prototype design freeze relatively soon afterwards resulting in its shape being rather unrefined and immature. In contrast, the YF-23 was a continual refinement of Northrop&#x27;s design concept even prior to Dem/Val proposal submission. Accurate artwork of the prototypes, which had been highly classified due to the stealth shaping, was first officially released in 1990 ahead of their public unveiling; the aforementioned Dem/Val extensions also pushed flight testing from 1989 to 1990. While the prototype air vehicle designs were frozen in 1988 in order to build the aircraft and begin flight tests by 1990, both teams continued to refine their F-22 and F-23 designs, or Preferred System Concepts, for full-scale development.
The first YF-23 made its maiden flight on 27 August 1990 and the first YF-22 first flew on 29 September 1990. Flight testing began afterwards at Edwards Air Force Base and added the second aircraft for each competitor in late October 1990. The first YF-23 with P&amp;W engines supercruised at Mach 1.43 on 18 September 1990 and the second YF-23 with GE engines officially reached over Mach 1.6 on 29 November 1990, topping out at Mach 1.72. The first YF-22 with GE engines achieved Mach 1.58 in supercruise on 3 November 1990 and the second YF-22 with P&amp;W engines also achieved Mach 1.43 on 27 December 1990. Maximum speed of both prototype designs in afterburner was in excess of Mach 2. Flight testing continued until December 1990 with the YF-22s accumulating 91.6 flight hours in 74 sorties while the YF-23s flew 65.2 hours in 50 sorties. Following flight testing, the contractor teams submitted their ATF full-scale development proposals on 31 December 1990. The teams&#x27; NATF designs, often referred to as &quot;NATF-22&quot; and &quot;NATF-23&quot; (they were never formally designated), were included in their proposals as well.

==Selection and full-scale development==

Following a review of the flight test results and proposals, the Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice announced the Lockheed team and Pratt &amp; Whitney as the competition winner for full-scale development, or Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), on 23 April 1991; by this time, the 1990 Major Aircraft Review by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had reduced the planned total ATF buy to 650 aircraft and peak production rate to 48 per year. Both air vehicle designs met or exceeded all performance requirements; the YF-23 was stealthier and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile. The U.S. Navy had begun considering a version of the ATF called Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) in 1986, and it has been speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more adaptable to the NATF. However, by late 1990 to early 1991, the Navy was beginning to back out of NATF due to escalating costs, and abandoned NATF completely by FY 1992.

The selection decision has been speculated by aviation observers to have involved industrial factors and perception of program management as much as the technical merit of the aircraft designs. At the time, Northrop was viewed as riskier because it was struggling with the B-2 and AGM-137 TSSAM programs in meeting cost, schedule, and predicted stealth performance. In contrast, Lockheed&#x27;s program management on the F-117 was lauded for meeting performance and delivering on schedule and within budget, with the aircraft achieving operational success over Panama and during the Gulf War. While the YF-23 air vehicle was in a higher state of maturity and refinement compared to the YF-22 due to the latter&#x27;s late redesign and partly as a result had better flight performance, the Lockheed team executed a more aggressive flight test plan with considerably higher number of sorties and hours flown; furthermore, Lockheed chose to execute high-visibility tests such as firing missiles and high angle-of-attack maneuvers that, while not required, improved its perception by the USAF in managing weapons systems risk. With the overall final F-22 and F-23 designs competitive with each other in technical performance and meeting all requirements, the USAF decision then took into consideration non-technical aspects such as confidence in program management when determining the winner.

The Lockheed team and Pratt &amp; Whitney were awarded the EMD contracts to fully develop and build the Advanced Tactical Fighter in August 1991, initially worth $9.55 billion and $1.375 billion respectively for a total of approximately $11 billion (~$ in ) as cost-plus contracts (which did eventually grow considerably). The YF-22 design was evolved and significantly refined to become the EMD/production F-22 Raptor version, which first flew in September 1997. However, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent reductions in defense spending, the F-22&#x27;s development would be &quot;re-phased&quot;, or drawn out and extended multiple times. The program was scrutinized for its costs and less expensive alternatives such as modernized F-15 or F-16 variants were continually being proposed, even though the USAF considered the F-22 to provide the greatest capability increase against peer adversaries for the investment. While the service adjusted its procurement goal down to 381 aircraft, the funded number in the program of record continued to decline, dropping to 339 at a peak rate of 36 per year by the time the EMD/production aircraft first flew. Both the F-22 and F-23 designs were later considered for modification as a medium-range supersonic regional bomber (FB-22 and FB-23 respectively), but the proposals have not come to fruition. Following flight and operational testing, the F-22 entered service in December 2005, but with no apparent air-to-air threat present and the Department of Defense focused on counterinsurgency at that time, F-22 production only reached 195 aircraft — 187 of them operational models — and ended in 2011.

<doc id="585363" wikidata="Q49203" url="?curid=585363" title="Sanyo">
<text>was a Japanese electronics manufacturer founded in 1947 by Toshio Iue, the brother-in-law of Kōnosuke Matsushita, the founder of Matsushita Electric Industrial, now known as Panasonic. Iue left Matsushita Electric to start his own business, acquiring some of its equipment to produce bicycle generator lamps. In 1950, the company was established. Sanyo began to diversify in the 1960s, having launched Japan&#x27;s first spray-type washing machine in 1953. In the 2000s, it was known as one of the 3S along with Sony and Sharp. Sanyo also focused on solar cell and lithium battery businesses. In 1992, it developed the world&#x27;s first hybrid solar cell, and in 2002, it had a 41% share of the global lithium-ion battery market. In its heyday in 2003, Sanyo had sales of about ¥2.5 trillion. However, it fell into a financial crisis as a result of its huge investment in the semiconductor business. In 2009, Sanyo was acquired by Panasonic, and in 2011, it was fully consolidated into Panasonic and its brand disappeared. The company still exists as a legal entity for the purpose of winding up its affairs. The world famous Sanyo sign, located at Piccadilly Circus in London, is well known for outlasting competing billboards like McDonalds, Conran Enterprises, Kodak and BradCorp. 

==History==
===Beginnings===

Sanyo was founded when Toshio Iue, the brother-in-law of Konosuke Matsushita and also a former Matsushita employee, was lent an unused Matsushita plant in 1947 and used it to make bicycle generator lamps. Sanyo was incorporated in 1949; it made Japan&#x27;s first plastic radio in 1952 and Japan&#x27;s first pulsator-type washing machine in 1954. The company&#x27;s name means &quot;three oceans&quot; in Japanese, referring to the founder&#x27;s ambition to sell their products worldwide, across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.

===Sanyo in America===
In 1969, Howard Ladd became the Executive Vice President and COO of Sanyo Corporation. Ladd introduced the Sanyo brand to the United States in 1970. The ambition to sell Sanyo products worldwide was realized in the mid-1970s after Sanyo introduced home audio equipment, car stereos and other consumer electronics to the North American market. The company embarked on a heavy television-based advertising campaign.

Ladd negotiated a purchase of the Fisher Electronics audio equipment manufacturer by Sanyo in May 1975. Under Ladd&#x27;s leadership, the Fisher Corporation under Sanyo grew to be a multi-million dollar leader in the consumer electronics industry. The new, profitable Fisher Corporation moved its headquarters from New York to Ladd&#x27;s Los Angeles. Ladd was named president and CEO of the combined Sanyo / Fisher Corporation in 1977, serving until 1987.

Ladd was instrumental at Sanyo in promoting Quadraphonic sound audio equipment for the American market, producing 4-channel audio equipment in both discrete and matrix formats. He said &quot;we make all kinds of quadrasonic equipment because this is the business we&#x27;re in... let the consumer buy the kind of software he prefers and we&#x27;ll provide him the hardware to play it on&quot;.

Sanyo realized tremendous growth during Ladd&#x27;s tenure in the 1970s; annual sales grew from $71.4 million () in 1972 to $855 million () in 1978.

After a fairly slow selling line in their own V-Cord video format, Sanyo adopted Sony&#x27;s Betamax video cassette format around 1977 with initial success, including SuperBeta and Beta Hi-Fi models. From around 1984 onwards, production switched entirely to VHS.

In 1976, Sanyo expanded their North American presence with the purchase of Whirlpool Corporation&#x27;s television business, Warwick Electronics, which manufactured televisions for Sears.

In 1986, Sanyo&#x27;s U.S. affiliate merged with Fisher to become Sanyo Fisher (U.S.A.) Corporation (later renamed Sanyo Fisher Company). The mergers made the entire organization more efficient, but also resulted in the departure of certain key executives, including Ladd, who had first introduced the Sanyo name to the United States in the early 1970s.

In 1982, Sanyo started selling the MBC-1000 series of CP/M computers. In 1983, it introduced the MBC-550 PC, the lowest-cost IBM PC compatible personal computer available at the time, but its lack of full compatibility drove Sanyo from the market and no follow-on models were released.

===1990s corporate culture===
An article on &quot;Sanyo Style&quot; written in 1992 described that Sanyo utilizes an extensive socialization process for new employees, so that they will be acclimatized to Sanyo&#x27;s corporate culture. New employees take a five-month course during which they eat together and sleep together in accommodation. They learn everything from basic job requirements to company expectations for personal grooming and the appropriate way in which to dress for their co-workers and superiors.

Technologically, Sanyo has had good ties with Sony, supporting the Betamax video format from invention until the mid-1980s (the best selling video recorder in the UK in 1983 was the Sanyo VTC5000), while producing the VHS video format at the same time for the Fisher brand during the early 1980s, and later being an early adopter of the highly successful Video8 camcorder format. More recently, though, Sanyo decided against supporting Sony&#x27;s format, the Blu-ray Disc, and instead gave its backing to Toshiba&#x27;s HD DVD. This was ultimately unsuccessful, however, as Sony&#x27;s Blu-ray triumphed.

In North America, Sanyo manufactured CDMA cellular phones exclusively for Sprint&#x27;s Sprint PCS brand in the United States and for Bell Mobility in Canada.

===Acquisition===
The 2004 Chūetsu earthquake severely damaged Sanyo&#x27;s semiconductor plant and as a result Sanyo recorded a huge financial loss for that year. The 2005 fiscal year financial results saw a 205 billion yen net income loss. The same year the company announced a restructuring plan called the Sanyo Evolution Project, launching a new corporate vision to make the corporation into an environmental company, plowing investment into strong products like rechargeable batteries, solar photovoltaics, air conditioning, hybrid car batteries and key consumer electronics such as the Xacti camera, projectors and mobile phones.

Sanyo posted signs of recovery after the announcement of positive operating income of 2.6 billion yen. Sanyo remains the world number one producer of rechargeable batteries. Recent product innovations in this area include the Eneloop Low self-discharge NiMH battery, a &quot;hybrid&quot; rechargeable NiMH (Nickel-metal hydride battery) which, unlike typical NiMH cells, can be used from-the-package without an initial recharge cycle and retain a charge significantly longer than batteries using standard NiMH battery design. The Eneloop line competes against similar products such as Rayovac&#x27;s &quot;Hybrid Rechargeable&quot; line.

On November 24, 2006, Sanyo announced heavy losses and job cuts.

Tomoyo Nonaka, a former NHK anchorwoman who was appointed chairwoman of the company, stepped down in March 2007. The President, Toshimasa Iue, also stepped down in April of that year; Seiichiro Sano was appointed to head the company effective April 2007.
In October 2007, Sanyo cancelled a 110 billion yen sale of its semiconductor business, blaming the global credit crisis for the decision and stating that after exploring its other options, it had decided to keep the business and develop it as part of its portfolio.


In 2008, Sanyo&#x27;s mobile phone division was acquired by Kyocera.

On November 2, 2008, Sanyo and Panasonic announced that they have agreed on the main points of a proposed buyout that would make Sanyo a subsidiary of Panasonic. They became a subsidiary of Panasonic on December 21, 2009.

In 2010, Sanyo sold its semiconductor operations to ON Semiconductor.

On July 29, 2010, Panasonic reached an agreement to acquire the remaining shares of Panasonic Electric Works and Sanyo shares for $9.4 billion.

By March 2012, parent company Panasonic plans to terminate the Sanyo brand, however it will remain on some of the products where the Sanyo brand still holds value to consumers. In the same month, Sanyo&#x27;s Southeast Asian unit, responsible for the manufacturing of consumer electric appliances in the region, was announced to be formally acquired by Haier.

In August 2013, a 51% majority stake in Chinese company Hefei Royalstar Sanyo, a 2000 joint venture between Sanyo and Chinese government investment company Hefei, was purchased by American multinational manufacturer Whirlpool Corporation for $552 million.

==Energy==

===Solar cells and plants===

The Sanyo HIT (Heterojunction with Intrinsic Thin layer) solar cell is composed of a mono thin crystalline silicon wafer surrounded by ultra-thin amorphous silicon layers.

Sanyo Energy opened its solar module assembly plants in Hungary and in Mexico in 2004, and in 2006 it produced solar modules worth $213 million. In 2007, Sanyo completed a new unit at its solar module plant in Hungary that was to triple its annual capacity to 720,000 units in 2008.

Plans to expand production were based on rising demands for Sanyo Hungary products, whose leading markets are Germany, Italy, Spain and Scandinavia. The plant at Dorog, outside Budapest, became Sanyo&#x27;s largest solar module production facility in the world. Germany, Italy, Spain and the Scandinavian countries. The plant at Dorog, outside Budapest, will be Sanyo Electric&#x27;s largest facility producing solar modules in the entire world.

In late September 2008, Sanyo announced its decision to build a manufacturing plant for solar ingots and wafers (the building blocks for silicon solar cells) in Inagi, Japan. The plant began operating in October 2009 and was to reach its full production capacity of 70 megawatts (MW) of solar wafers per year by April 2010. Sanyo and Nippon Oil decided to launch a joint company, known as Sanyo Eneos Solar Co., Ltd., for the production and sale of thin-film solar panels. The new joint company began production and sales at an initial scale of 80 MW, while gradually increasing its production capacity. For this joint project, Sanyo drew on its solar cell technologies, based on the technology acquired through the development of the HIT solar cell.

Sanyo is also responsible for the construction of the Solar Ark.

===Rechargeable batteries===
Sanyo pioneered the production of nickel cadmium batteries in 1964, nickel metal hydride batteries (NiMh) in 1990, lithium-ion batteries in 1994, and lithium polymer batteries in 1999. In 2000, it acquired Toshiba&#x27;s NiMh business, including the Takasaki factory. Since the acquisition of Sanyo by Panasonic, ownership of the Takasaki factory was transferred to the FDK Corporation.

===Electric vehicle batteries===
Sanyo supplies NiMh batteries to Honda, Ford, Volkswagen and PSA Peugeot Citroen. Sanyo is developing NiMH batteries for hybrid electric vehicles with the Volkswagen group, while their lithium-ion batteries for plug-in HEV will also be housed in Suzuki fleet vehicles.

Sanyo planned to raise monthly production of NiMH batteries for hybrid vehicles from 1 million units to up to 2.5 million by the end of fiscal 2005.

==Sanyo India==

===Televisions===
Panasonic reintroduced the Sanyo brand in India, with the launch of Sanyo LED TV range on August 8, 2016. On July 11, 2017, Sanyo launched its range of smart TVs on Amazon Prime Day. In August 2017, Sanyo unveiled its NXT range of LED televisions exclusively on Flipkart. In December 2017, Sanyo introduced its first 4K smart TV range in India.

In September 2019, Sanyo introduced a range of Android TV sets known as the Sanyo Kaizen Series.

===Air conditioners===
Sanyo worked with Energy Efficiency Services Limited to develop a 1.5-ton inverter air conditioner (AC) with an Indian Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (ISEER) of 5.2. Distribution of these air conditioners began in September 2017.

On April 4, 2019, Sanyo launched a new AC range exclusively on Amazon.

==Sanyo TV USA==
Though founded in Japan, Sanyo has sold TVs in America for over 50 years; Sanyo TV USA was headquartered in San Diego, California with facilities located in Tijuana, Mexico.

Many of Sanyo&#x27;s television sets offer MHL compatibility along with Roku-ready branding via HDMI, meaning the TVs are compatible with Roku&#x27;s MHL-specific streaming stick. Sometimes included with purchase, such as with the Sanyo FVF5044, this stick enables video streaming and other online functions as an affordable alternative to certain smart TVs; the TV&#x27;s original remote is capable of browsing the service. Multiple models also have USB ports which allow for immediate photo sharing directly off the stick without any additional software/upgrades.

=== Funai Era ===
In October 2014, Panasonic announced its intent to transfer the Sanyo TV unit to Funai in the US market in return for annual royalty payments. Funai is a major Walmart supplier that also supplies Philips and Emerson TV sets to the retail chain. Consumer Reports commented in 2018 that Sanyo TVs &quot;seem to turn up mostly in Walmart stores, almost as a private label for the retailer.&quot;

<doc id="585371" wikidata="Q191493" url="?curid=585371" title="Sommelier">
<text>A sommelier ( , , ), or wine steward, is a trained and knowledgeable wine professional, normally working in fine restaurants, who specializes in all aspects of wine service as well as wine and food pairing. The role of the &quot;sommelier&quot; in fine dining today is much more specialized and informed than that of a wine waiter. &quot;Sommeliers Australia&quot; states that the role is strategically on par with that of the &quot;chef de cuisine&quot;.

==Description==
A sommelier may be responsible for the development of wine lists and books and for the delivery of wine service and training for the other restaurant staff. Working along with the culinary team, they pair and suggest wines that will best complement each particular food menu item. This entails the need for a deep knowledge of how food and wine, beer, spirits and other beverages work in harmony. A professional sommelier also works on the floor of the restaurant and is in direct contact with restaurant customers. The sommelier has a responsibility to work within the taste preference and budget parameters of the patron.

In modern times, a sommelier&#x27;s role may be considered broader than working only with wines, and may encompass all aspects of the restaurant&#x27;s service, with an enhanced focus on wines, beers, spirits, soft-drinks, cocktails, mineral waters, and tobaccos.

==Etymology==
The modern word is French, deriving from Middle French where it referred to a court official charged with transportation of supplies. This use of the term dates to a period when pack animals would be used to transport supplies. The Middle French probably finds its origin in Old Provençal where a &quot;saumalier&quot; was a pack animal driver. &quot;Sauma&quot; referred to a pack animal or the load of a pack animal. In Late Latin, &quot;sagma&quot; referred to a packsaddle.

==Education and certification==
Though &quot;sommelier&quot; is a job title potentially anyone may claim, becoming a professional certified sommelier often requires some combination of experience, training, formal education (a bachelor&#x27;s degree is not required, but individuals may do a two-year associate degree), classes and examinations. It is possible to become a sommelier by starting at the entry level in the hospitality or wine industry and working up, though many choose to become educated and professionally certified by one (or more) of the many certifying bodies. Various certifications are offered by a wide range of educators. A very basic education in wine may be attained over the course of months at a cost in the hundreds of dollars, but advanced professional certification typically requires years of study, practice and experience costing thousands of dollars. A thorough education in wine is still less expensive than typical graduate school costs in the US.

===The Court of Master Sommeliers===
The &#x27;Court of Master Sommeliers&#x27; (CMS), established in 1977, is an independent examining body that offers the &#x27;Master Sommelier Diploma&#x27;, the &#x27;Advanced Sommelier Certificate&#x27;, the &#x27;Certified Sommelier Certificate&#x27;, and the &#x27;Introductory Sommelier Certificate&#x27;. It was created under the supervision of the Worshipful Company of Vintners, the Institute of Masters of Wine, the British Hotels &amp; Restaurants Association, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association of Great Britain, and the Wholesale Tobacco Trade Association. Since the Master Sommelier Diploma was introduced in 1969, a total of 249 people from around the world had become Master Sommeliers by the end of 2017. The Court also offers intermediate levels of education including the annual &quot;Advanced Sommelier Course&quot;, which prepares invited candidates to sit for the Advanced Exam, generally offered 2–3 times per year. Taking the Advanced Course and passing the Advanced Exam are mandatory before sitting for the Masters Exam.

===International Sommelier Guild===
The &#x27;International Sommelier Guild&#x27; (ISG) educates and certifies sommeliers throughout America, Canada, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. It was founded in 1982 and the programme consists of Level 1 Wine Fundamentals, Level 2 Wine Fundamentals and a Sommelier Diploma. They also offer a &#x27;Certified Sommelier Instructor&#x27; diploma.

===International Wine &amp; Spirits Guild===
The International Wine Guild was founded in 1998 and is approved and regulated by the Colorado Department of Higher Education. The independent school offers the Level IV &#x27;Guild Master Wine Educator Diploma&#x27;, the Level III &#x27;Guild Wine Master Diploma and Certification&#x27;, the Level II &#x27;Advanced Wine Course and Executive Sommelier Certification&#x27; and the Level I &#x27;Introductory Wine Sommelier Certification&#x27;. The International Wine &amp; Spirits Guild was established to encourage study to develop technical and professional understanding and increased knowledge of wine throughout all areas of the wine, spirits and food service industry. IWSG also offers professional courses and certifications for Wine Judges, Wine Instructors, and in Fine Spirits and &quot;Sake&quot;.

===North American Sommelier Association===
The North American Sommelier Association was founded in 2006 and is the official representative in the United States and Canada of the Worldwide Sommelier Association (WSA). Its Certified Sommelier course is divided into three phases but is offered as one entire course and includes extensive class time, lectures, educational visits to wineries, and educational dinners. Unlike other groups, NASA has only two tiers of Sommelier qualification: Silver-Pin and Gold-Pin. The Gold-Pin qualification is obtained through a series of extensive requirements and certifications (Master Wine Taster, Master Of Service...) as well as proof of experience in the industry. Aside from the Sommelier Certification, NASA also provides various smaller proprietary specialization courses, such as &#x27;Italian Wine Specialist&#x27;, &#x27;American Wine Specialist&#x27;, &#x27;Spanish Wine Specialist&#x27; and various master-classes such as &#x27;Master Of Terroir&#x27;, &#x27;Master of Sangiovese&#x27;, &#x27;Master of Service&#x27;, and &#x27;Master Wine Taster&#x27;.

===National Wine School===
The National Wine School was founded in 2009 in Los Angeles, California. The school offers ANSI-compliant professional certification for the wine trade in the United States. They offer five levels of wine certification. To earn a sommelier pin, one must complete level three certification. To earn the advanced sommelier pin, the student must complete the level four certification.

===&quot;Union de la Sommellerie Française&quot;===
In France, the &quot;Union des Sommeliers&quot; (UDS) was founded in 1907 to ensure social protection for its members, both sommeliers and cellar masters in Paris region. The approach and role of the association developed throughout the years as it lost its autonomy by merging with the &quot;Mutualité Hôtelière&quot; in 1959. Ten years later, sommeliers regained their independence as the &quot;Association des Sommeliers de Paris&quot; (ASP) was founded in 1969. In the same year the &quot;Association de la Sommellerie Internationale&quot; (ASI) was created and federated other organisations in the world, and in 1970 the old UDS was renamed in &quot;Union de la Sommellerie Française&quot;, UDSF, which supervises today the 21 regional associations in France (including ASP). The title of &quot;Mention Complémentaire Sommellerie&quot; (MCS) and &quot;Brevet Professionnel de Sommelier&quot; (BP) can be achieved studying for many different approved providers, and the final qualification of &quot;Maître Sommelier&quot; can be achieved after an accurate career assessment, requiring at least 10 years of professional experience.

===&quot;Associazione Italiana Sommelier&quot;===
In Italy, the Italian Sommelier Association, &#x27;AIS&#x27;, founded on 7 July 1965, is one of the oldest sommelier associations of the world. It is officially recognised and legally acknowledged by the Italian government. The Italian Sommelier Association is part and founding member of the &quot;Worldwide Sommelier Association&quot; (WSA), which is officially recognized throughout the world. It is actually the largest sommelier association ever featuring over 33,000 members only in Italy. AIS / WSA is famous worldwide for its technical tasting approach and methodology, patented food &amp; wine pairing technique, publications, service standards and three-levels course structure which leads to the &quot;Certified Sommelier&quot; qualification. A &quot;Professional Sommelier&quot; qualification and diploma is issued by AIS, after a candidate&#x27;s career assessment, for those sommeliers actually working in a food and beverage establishment.

===Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust===
The Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust, often referred to as &#x27;WSET&#x27;, does not offer sommelier certifications. Despite this, many sommeliers choose to earn these qualifications due to similar curriculum and the WSET&#x27;s structured approach that allows one to gain knowledge through tutored coursework.

=== Contest for the Best Sommelier in the World ===
The &quot;Association de la Sommelerie Internationale&quot; (ASI) organizes the World’s Best Sommelier Contest every 3 years since 1969. The event in 2019 crowned the German candidate named Marc Almert. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 17th edition of the contest took place in 2023 instead of 2022 in Paris.

<doc id="585373" wikidata="Q191488" url="?curid=585373" title="Ornithischia">
<text>Ornithischia () is an extinct clade of mainly herbivorous dinosaurs characterized by a pelvic structure superficially similar to that of birds. The name &quot;Ornithischia&quot;, or &quot;bird-hipped&quot;, reflects this similarity and is derived from the Greek stem &#x27; (), meaning &quot;bird&quot;, and&#x27; (), meaning &quot;hip&quot;. However, as theropod dinosaurs, birds are only distantly related to this group.

Ornithischians with well known anatomical adaptations include the ceratopsians or &quot;horn-faced&quot; dinosaurs (e.g. &quot;Triceratops&quot;), the pachycephalosaurs or &quot;thick-headed&quot; dinosaurs, the armored dinosaurs (Thyreophora) such as stegosaurs and ankylosaurs, and the ornithopods. There is strong evidence that certain groups of ornithischians lived in herds, often segregated by age group, with juveniles forming their own flocks separate from adults. Some were at least partially covered in filamentous (hair- or feather- like) pelts, and there is much debate over whether these filaments found in specimens of &quot;Tianyulong&quot;, &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Kulindadromeus&quot; may have been primitive feathers.

== Description ==
Ornithischia is a very large and diverse group of dinosaurs, with members known from all continents, habitats, and a very large range of sizes. They are primarily herbivorous browsers or grazers, but some members may have also been opportunistic omnivores. Ornithischians are united by multiple features of the skull, teeth, and skeleton, including especially the presence of a and , an increased number of , the absence of , and an . Early ornithischians ranged around in length, with them increasing in size over time so that the largest armoured ornithischians were around and , the largest horned ornithischians were around and , and the largest crested ornithischians were around and .

Much of the knowledge of early ornithischian anatomy comes from &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot;, which is a taxon known from multiple skulls and skeletons from the Early Jurassic of Lesotho. The rear of its skull is box-like, while the snout tapers to a point. The is small, the that opens from the side of the skull into the palate is large, shallow and triangular, the is large and round and has a palpebral creating a brow, and the lower jaw has a large .

The skulls of &quot;Emausaurus&quot; and &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot;, two early members of the armoured group Thyreophora, show similarities in the box-like skull that tapers to the front. The antorbital fossa is smaller and forming an elongate oval in both taxa, and the palpebral which is elongate and slender in &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; is widened in &quot;Emausaurus&quot; and completely incorporated into the skull as a flat bone in &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot;. Skulls in members of the thyreophoran group Stegosauria are much longer and lower, with the width at the back being greater than the height in &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. The snout and lower jaw are long and deep, and in some genera the does not have any teeth. As in &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot;, the palpebral forms the top border of the orbit as a flat brow bone, but the antorbital fossa is reduced to the point of absence in some genera.

Ankylosaurs, the other group of armoured ornithischians, have very robust, immobile skulls, with three significant features that separate them from other groups. The antorbital fossa, and mandibular fenestra are all closed, the sutures separating skull bones are almost completely obliterated by surface texturing, and there is bony armour above the orbits, and at the top and bottom corners of the back of the skull. Teeth are sometimes absent from the premaxilla, and both the upper and lower jaws have deeply inset teeth creating large cheeks. Ankylosaurs also have very extensive and complicated network of sinuses, formed by bone growth in the palate.

The skulls are known from many early ornithopods and some heterodontosaurids, showing similar general features. Skulls are relatively tall with shorter snouts, but the snout is elongated in some later taxa like &quot;Thescelosaurus&quot;. The orbit and antorbital fossa are large, but the nasal opening is small, and while teeth are present in the premaxilla, there is a toothless front tip that likely formed a keratinous beak. The premaxillary teeth and the first lower tooth in &quot;Heterodontosaurus&quot; are enlarged into sizeable canines. In later ornithopods, the skulls are more elongate and sometimes fully rectangular, with a very large nasal opening, and a thin, elongate palpebral that can extend the entire way across the orbit. Teeth are almost always absent from the premaxilla, the antorbital fossa is reduced and round to slit-like, the tip of the snout is sometimes flared to form a broad beak. Members of the ornithopod family Hadrosauridae show further adaptations, including the formation of where teeth are continuously replaced, and in many genera the development of prominent cranial crests formed by multiple different bones of the skull.

Pachycephalosauria, at one time thought to be close to ornithopods and now known to be related instead to ceratopsians, show a unique skull anatomy that is unlike any other ornithischian. The bones of the top of the skull are thickened and in many taxa expanded significantly to form round bony domes as the top of the head, as well as possessing small nodes or elongate spikes along the back edge of the skull. Many taxa are only known from these thick skull domes, which are fused from the and bones. As in many other ornithischians, the snout is short and tapering, the nasal opening is small, the antorbital fossa is sometimes absent, and there are premaxillary teeth, though only three. The two palpebrals are also incorporated into the skull roof as in thyreophorans, rather than free.

Ceratopsians, the sister group to pachycephalosaurs, also display many cranial adaptations, most importantly the evolution of a bone called the that forms the top beak opposite the predentary. The bones flare to the sides to create a pentagonal skull seen from above, the nasal opening is closer to the top of the snout than the teeth, and while the snout tapers in some taxa, it is very deep and short in &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot;. The ceratopsian palpebral is generally triangular, and the back edge of the skull roof forms a flat frill that is enlarged in more derived ceratopsians. The ceratopsian family Ceratopsidae progresses on these features with the addition of horns above each orbit and on the top of the snout, as well as substantial elongation of the frill and in many genera the development of two large forming holes in the frill. The skull and frill elongation makes the skulls of &quot;Torosaurus&quot; and &quot;Pentaceratops&quot; the largest of any known terrestrial vertebrate, at over long.

Early ornithischians were relatively small dinosaurs, averaging about 1–2 meters in body length, with a triangular skull that had large circular orbits on the sides. This suggests that early ornithischians had relatively huge eyes that faced laterally. The forelimbs of early ornithischians are considerably shorter than their hindlimbs. A small forelimb such as those present in early ornithischians would not have been useful for locomotion, and it is evident that early ornithischians were bipedal dinosaurs. The entire skeleton was lightly built, with a largely fenestrated skull and a very stout neck and trunk. The tail is nearly half of the dinosaurs&#x27; overall length. The long tail presumably acted as a counterbalance and as a compensating mechanism for shifts in the creature&#x27;s center of gravity. The hindlimbs of early ornithischians show that the tibia is considerably longer than the femur, a feature that suggests that early ornithischians were adapted for bipedality, and were fast runners.

=== &quot;Bird-hip&quot; ===
The ornithischian pelvis was &quot;opisthopubic&quot;, meaning that the pubis pointed down and backwards (posterior), parallel with the ischium (Figure 1a). Additionally, the ilium had a forward-pointing process (the preacetabular process) to support the abdomen. This resulted in a four-pronged pelvic structure. In contrast to this, the saurischian pelvis was &quot;propubic&quot;, meaning the pubis pointed toward the head (anterior), as in ancestral reptiles (Figure 1b).

The opisthopubic pelvis independently evolved at least three times in dinosaurs (in ornithischians, birds and therizinosauroids). Some argue that the opisthopubic pelvis evolved a fourth time, in the clade Dromaeosauridae, but this is controversial, as other authors argue that dromaeosaurids are mesopubic. It has also been argued that the opisthopubic condition is basal to maniraptorans (including among others birds, therizinosauroids and dromaeosaurids), with some clades having later experienced a reversal to the propubic condition.

===History===

The first recognition of an herbivorous group of dinosaurs was named Orthopoda in 1866 by Edward Drinker Cope, a name that is now recognized as a synonym of Ornithischia. Discussions on the taxonomy of dinosaurs by Othniel Charles Marsh identified two major groups of herbivorous dinosaurs, Ornithopoda and Stegosauria, containing genera from a broad geographic and stratigraphic distribution. While often these groups were placed within Dinosauria, Harry Govier Seeley suggested instead in 1888 that ornithopods and stegosaurs, which shared many features in the skull, limbs, and hip, were unrelated to other dinosaurs, and so he proposed that Dinosauria was an unnatural grouping of two independently-evolved suborders, Saurischia and Ornithischia. It is from the anatomy of the hip that Seeley chose the name Ornithischia, referencing the bird-like anatomy of the ischium bone. Many researchers did not follow the division of Seeley at first, with Marsh naming the group Predentata to unite ornithopods, stegosaurs, and Ceratopsia within Dinosauria, but with additional work and new discoveries the unnatural nature of Dinosauria came to be accepted, and the names Seeley proposed found common use. After further decades, in 1974 Robert T. Bakker and Peter M. Galton provided new evidence in support of the grouping of ornithischians and saurischians together within a natural Dinosauria, which has been supported since.

The first cladistic studies on Ornithischia were published simultaneously in 1984 by David B. Norman, Andrew R. Milner, and Paul C. Sereno. These studies differed somewhat in their results, but found that &quot;Iguanodon&quot; was closer to hadrosaurs than other ornithopods, followed by &quot;Dryosaurus&quot;, &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; and then &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; and its relatives. While the study of Norman placed ceratopsians between &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; and more derived ornithopods, the study of Sereno placed ceratopsians with ankylosaurs and stegosaurs. It has since been recognized by that ceratopsians are closer to ornithopods than the armoured ankylosaurs and stegosaurs, but the relationships of some groups are still in states of change, with some more consistent results than others. An early study that looked at the relationships within Ornithischia with greater detail was that of Sereno in 1986, who provided features that supported the evolution of all ornithischian groups and shared similarities with earlier studies. Sereno found that &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; was the most primitive ornithischian, with all other ornithischians united within the clade Genasauria, which has two subgroups. The first subgroup, Thyreophora, unites ankylosaurs and stegosaurs along with more primitive taxa like &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot;, while the second subgroup, Cerapoda, contained ornithopods, ceratopsians, pachycephalosaurs, and small primitive forms. One group of the small primitive forms considered to be cerapodans by Sereno, Heterodontosauridae, has since been found to be a group of very early ornithischians of similar evolutionary status as &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot;, although this result is not definitive.

The first large-scale numerical analysis of the phylogenetics of Ornithischia was published in 2008 by Richard J. Butler and colleagues, including many primitive ornithischians and members from all of the major subgroups, to test some of the hypotheses given previously about ornithischian evolution and the relationships of the groups. Thyreophora was found to be a supported group, as well as the clade of pachycephalosaurs and ceratopsians that Sereno named Marginocephalia in 1986. Some taxa considered earlier to be ornithopods, like heterodontosaurids, &quot;Agilisaurus&quot;, &quot;Hexinlusaurus&quot; and &quot;Othnielia&quot;, were instead found to be outside of both Ornithopoda and Ceratopsia, but still closer to those two groups than thyreophorans. The early Argentinian taxon &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot; was found to be the most primitive ornithischian, but while overall results agreed with earlier studies and showed some stability, areas of the evolutionary tree were found to be problematic, and with potential for later change. In 2021, a new phylogenetic study was published authored by Paul-Emile Dieudonné and colleagues that instead found Heterodontosauridae to nest alongside Pachycephalosauria within Marginocephalia, changing the early evolution of ornithopods considerably, and showing that the evolution of ornithischians was far from definitive. Below are the cladograms of Sereno, Butler and colleagues, and Dieudonné and colleagues, restricted to the major clades of Ornithischia, Heterodontosauridae, &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; and &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot;.

===Subgroups===
When Ornithischia was first named, Seeley united the orders Ornithopoda and Stegosauria of Marsh&#x27;s taxonomy within the new group. Ceratopsia was then recognized as a unique group related to ornithopods and stegosaurs by Marsh by 1894, with each of the three suborders still being recognized as distinct groups today. Ceratopsians are recognized as group that grew in diversity later in the Cretaceous after evolving in the Late Jurassic, encompassing a diverse array of bodyforms from the small, bipedal &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; up to the very large, quadrupedal, horned and frilled ceratopsids like &quot;Torosaurus&quot;, which has the longest skull of any terrestrial vertebrate. Ornithopods, which range from the Early Jurassic in some studies until the end of the Cretaceous with continuous diversity, are generally bipedal and unarmoured, though some later groups like Hadrosauridae evolved complex dental anatomy in the form of batteries of teeth. Stegosaurs are comparatively limited, restricted to a primarily Jurassic group of moderate to large, quadrupedal herbivores with two rows of vertical plates ornamenting their spine, which possibly did not go extinct until the Late Cretaceous, though at the time of Marsh Stegosauria was used for all armored and quadrupedal taxa, many of which are now separated into Ankylosauria. Ankylosaurs were only recognized as a distinct group from stegosaurs in the 1920s despite many members being known for decades before, with the group now encompassing a broad array of heavy, quadrupedal ornithischians with extensive armour covering their body and skull. The fifth recognized major subgroup of ornithischians is Pachycephalosauria, which was first named in 1974 after being confused for a long time with the theropod &quot;Troodon&quot; on account of their similarly omnivorous and unique teeth. Pachycephalosaurians are unique for their tall, thickened skulls and small, bipedal bauplan, suggesting that their domes were for sexual display or combat in the form of head-butting or flank-butting. Some taxa, particularly those at one point groupt together in the ornithopod family Hypsilophodontidae, are now recognized to not fall within any of the major ornithischian groups, and either be outside Genasauria, or on the basal stem of Neornithischia outside Cerapoda.

Following the publication of the PhyloCode to provide rules and regulations on the use of taxonomic names for groups, the internal classification of Ornithischia was revised by Daniel Madzia and colleagues in 2021 to provide a framework of definitions and taxa for other studies to follow and modify from. They names the new clade Saphornithischia to unite heterodontosaurids with more derived ornithischians to encompass the concept of the well-supported clear ornithischians, as the origins of the group and the relationships of primitive taxa like &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot; and members of Silesauridae may sometimes be found to be ornithischians outside this core grouping. Madzia and colleagues also provided a composite cladogram of Ornithischia to illustrate the consensus of internal divisions, which can be seen below. Ornithischia has been defined as all taxa closer to &quot;Iguanodon&quot; than &quot;Allosaurus&quot; or &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;. Genasauria has been defined as the smallest clade containing &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Triceratops&quot;.

Multiple taxa within Ornithischia fall around the origin of the group, or cannot be classified definitively. &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; and &quot;Laquintasaura&quot; have been found as basal thyreophorans or basal ornithischians, &quot;Chilesaurus&quot; is either a theropod or a basal ornithischian, &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot; has been found as a basal ornithischian or a non-ornithischian silesaurid, &quot;Eocursor&quot; has been a basal ornithischian or a basal member of Neornithischia, &quot;Serendipaceratops&quot; cannot be classified beyond Ornithischia as it is either an ankylosaur or a ceratopsian, and &quot;Alocodon&quot;, &quot;Fabrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ferganocephale&quot;, &quot;Gongbusaurus&quot;, &quot;Taveirosaurus&quot;, &quot;Trimucrodon&quot; and &quot;Xiaosaurus&quot; are dubious ornithischians of uncertain basal classification. Depending on the phylogenetic results, Silesauridae could either be a clade within Ornithischia, its members could form an evolutionary gradient, or some members found form a clade while others are part of a gradient.

===Evolution===

For a long time, the only understanding of the origins of Ornithischia came from &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; and &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot;, which together represented the best-known Early Jurassic and Triassic ornithischians respectively. Many suggestions of taxa and specimens that could be referred to Ornithischia from the Triassic were based on teeth and jaw bones, as they showed similar adaptations for herbivory. The genera &quot;Revueltosaurus&quot;, &quot;Galtonia&quot;, &quot;Pekinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tecovasaurus&quot;, &quot;Lucianosaurus&quot;, &quot;Protecovasaurus&quot;, &quot;Crosbysaurus&quot;, and &quot;Azendohsaurus&quot; were all at one time considered to be Triassic ornithischians with only their teeth known, but are now recognized to be completely unrelated. The only early ornithischians that were considered to be diagnostic in a 2004 review by Norman and colleagues were &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot;, &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot; and &quot;Technosaurus&quot;, limiting the early ornithischian record to only two Triassic genera from Argentina and the United States and one Early Jurassic genus from South Africa, with all the tooth taxa being considered undiagnostic. Referrals of isolated teeth to Ornithischia based on herbivorous features began to be extensively questioned by William G. Parker and colleagues in 2005 after the discovery of skull and skeleton material clearly from &quot;Revueltosaurus&quot; showing that the &quot;ornithischian-like&quot; teeth were from an animal more closely related to crocodiles than birds, and there were multiple occurrences of herbivory throughout Triassic reptiles. Removing the list of Triassic tooth taxa from Ornithischia, the early diversity of the group was substantially reduced, especially in comparison to the known Triassic diversity of theropods and sauropodomorphs. If &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot; represented the earliest ornithischian, there would be at least a 20 million year gap in the evolution of Ornithischia until &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; and heterodontosaurids. It is possible that the limited early record of ornithischians is due to them inhabiting environments that were less conducive to fossilization, or that the phylogenetics of the group were incorrect and that early ornithischians were already known but identified as members of other groups.

First noted in the 2003 naming of the early taxon &quot;Silesaurus&quot;, some taxa generally considered non-dinosaurs show similarities to ornithischians in the teeth and jaw anatomy. These basal taxa, which were then grouped within Silesauridae and commonly as the sister group to Dinosauria, may instead be the earliest ornithischians. They show adaptations for the evolution of herbivory, and can fill in the gap in early evolution of ornithischians that were otherwise only clearly known since the beginning of the Jurassic. This hypothesis has found support in multiple different phylogenetic analyses, but the results are not yet accepted as definitive enough to contradict other possible evolutionary strategies of dinosaurs. Alternatively, and more in line with earlier studies on dinosaur evolution, silesaurids may be the sister taxa to the Saurischia-Ornithischia split, or even other arrangements of the three main dinosaur groups Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda. The 2017 phylogenetic study of Matthew G. Baron and colleagues suggested that instead of a Saurischia-Ornithischia split, ornithischians were instead closest to theropods in the clade Ornithoscelida, with sauropodomorphs being outside the grouping. Under this case, the omnivory in the earliest sauropodomorphs and ornithischians would be the ancestral condition for dinosaurs, along with the grasping abilities seen in the earliest ornithischians and theropods. While Ornithoscelida is a possible hypothesis for the evolution of dinosaurs and the close relationships of Ornithischia, follow-up studies have not found it statistically more likely than the traditional dichotomy of Ornithischia and Saurischia, or the third alternative, Phytodinosauria, where ornithischians and sauropodomorphs are closer to each other than theropods.

Along with &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot;, which was supported as the earliest ornithischian for a time before being considered just as likely to be a silesaur rather than an ornithischian, an additional problematic taxon is &quot;Chilesaurus&quot; from the Late Jurassic of Chile. While it was originally named as a derived theropod with unique anatomy, it was found in studies based on Baron and colleagues results to instead be either the basalmost ornithischian, or a sauropodomorph. As the earliest ornithischian, &quot;Chilesaurus&quot; tied multiple details of ornithischian and theropod anatomy together supporting their union in Ornithoscelida, though when it is not the basalmost ornithischian, a traditional Saurischia is recovered. The problematic nature of &quot;Chilesaurus&quot; requires further revisiting of its anatomy, but the details of vertebral air pockets, pelvis shape, and hand support it as a theropod. &quot;Daemonosaurus&quot;, typically a theropod or close relative of herrerasaurs, has also been found as the basalmost ornithischian at times when Ornithoscelida is recovered, but it does not share any unique features with ornithischians and redescribing its anatomy found it fairly confidently to be a basal dinosaur not related closely to Ornithischia.

The phylogenetic analysis of Norman and colleagues in 2022 recovered the members of Silesauridae as forming an ancestral grade within Ornithischia even with the inclusion of &quot;Chilesaurus&quot;, supporting the earlier results of Müller and Garcia and their evolutionary trends for early ornithischian anatomy. Norman and colleagues used Prionodontia over both Saphornithischia and Genasauria, since all were recovered as encompassing the same node. The earliest ornithischians under this reconstruction were faunivorous, as seen by &quot;Lewisuchus&quot;, which has typical teeth like theropods. Serrations on teeth become larger for taxa more derived than &quot;Asilisaurus&quot;, the development of a cingulum in teeth is seen in &quot;Technosaurus&quot; and later ornithischians, the lower jaw becomes more elongate in taxa above &quot;Silesaurus&quot;, and core ornithischians are united by the pubic bone angling backwards, and the modification of the ankle joint.

== Palaeoecology ==
Ornithischians shifted from bipedal to quadrupedal posture at least three times in their evolutionary history and it has been shown primitive members may have been capable of both forms of movement.

Most ornithischians were herbivorous. In fact, most of the unifying characters of Ornithischia are thought to be related to this herbivory. For example, the shift to an opisthopubic pelvis is thought to be related to the development of a large stomach or stomachs and gut which would allow ornithischians to more effectively digest plant matter. The smallest known ornithischian is &quot;Fruitadens haagarorum&quot;. The largest &quot;Fruitadens&quot; individuals reached just 65–75 cm. Previously, only carnivorous, saurischian theropods were known to reach such small sizes. At the other end of the spectrum, the largest known ornithischians reach about 15 meters (smaller than the largest saurischians).

However, not all ornithischians were strictly herbivorous. Some groups, like the heterodontosaurids, were likely omnivores. At least one species of ankylosaurian, &quot;Liaoningosaurus paradoxus&quot;, appears to have been at least partially carnivorous, with hooked claws, fork-like teeth, and stomach contents suggesting that it may have fed on fish. The members of Genasauria were primarily herbivores. Genasaurians most often had their head at the level of one meter, which suggests they were feeding primarily on “ground-level plants such as ferns, cycads, and other herbaceous gymnosperms.&quot;

There is strong evidence that some ornithischians lived in herds. This evidence consists of multiple bone beds where large numbers of individuals of the same species and of different age groups died simultaneously.

<doc id="585377" wikidata="Q3518574" url="?curid=585377" title="Anagarika Dharmapala">
<text>[[Anagarika|Anagārika]] Dharmapāla (Pali: &quot;Anagārika&quot;, ; Sinhala: Anagārika, lit., ; 17 September 1864 – 29 April 1933) was a Sri Lankan Buddhist revivalist and a writer. 

Anagarika Dharmapāla is noted because he was:
* the first global Buddhist missionary
* one of the founding contributors of non-violent Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism 
* a leading figure in the Sri Lankan independence movement against British rule
* a pioneer in the revival of Buddhism in India after it had been virtually extinct for several centuries
* the first Buddhist in modern times to preach the Dhamma in three continents: Asia, North America, and Europe.
* kept a close and cordial relationship with Ven. Kripasaran, a pioneer in the revival of Buddhism in Bengal and India 

Along with Henry Steel Olcott and Helena Blavatsky, the creators of the Theosophical Society, he was a major reformer and revivalist of Sinhala Buddhism and an important figure in its western transmission. He also inspired a mass movement of South Indian Dalits including Tamils to embrace Buddhism, half a century before B. R. Ambedkar. In his later life, he became a Buddhist monk with the name of Venerable Sri Devamitta Dharmapala.

== Early life and education ==

Anagarika Dharmapala was born on 17 September 1864 in Colombo, Ceylon to Don Carolis Hewavitharana of Hiththetiya, Matara and Mallika Dharmagunawardhana (the daughter of Andiris Perera Dharmagunawardhana), who were among the richest merchants of Ceylon at the time. He was named Don David Hewavitharane. His younger brothers were Dr Charles Alwis Hewavitharana and Edmund Hewavitarne. He attended Christian College, Kotte; St Benedict&#x27;s College, Kotahena; S. Thomas&#x27; College, Mutwal and the Colombo Academy (Royal College).

== Buddhist revival ==
In 1875, during a period of Buddhist revival, Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott had founded the Theosophical Society in New York City. They were both very sympathetic to what they understood of Buddhism, and in 1880 they arrived in Ceylon, declared themselves to be Buddhists, and publicly took the Refuges and Precepts from a prominent Sinhalese bhikkhu. Colonel Olcott kept coming back to Ceylon and devoted himself there to the cause of Buddhist education, eventually setting up more than 300 Buddhist schools, some of which are still in existence. It was in this period that Hewavitarne changed his name to Anagarika Dharmapala.

&#x27;Dharmapāla&#x27; means &#x27;protector of the dharma&#x27;. &#x27;Anagārika&#x27; in Pāli means &quot;homeless one&quot;. It is a midway status between monk and layperson. As such, he took the eight precepts (refrain from killing, stealing, sexual activity, wrong speech, intoxicating drinks and drugs, eating after noon, entertainments and fashionable attire, and luxurious beds) for life. These eight precepts were commonly taken by Ceylonese laypeople on observance days. But for a person to take them for life was highly unusual. Dharmapala was the first &quot;anagarika&quot; – that is, a celibate, full-time worker for Buddhism – in modern times. It seems that he took a vow of celibacy at the age of eight and remained faithful to it all his life. Although he wore a yellow robe, it was not of the traditional bhikkhu pattern, and he did not shave his head. He felt that the observance of all the vinaya rules would get in the way of his work, especially as he flew around the world. Neither the title nor the office became popular, but in this role, he &quot;was the model for lay activism in modernist Buddhism.&quot; He is considered a bodhisattva in Sri Lanka.

His trip to Bodh-Gaya was inspired by an 1885 visit there by Sir Edwin Arnold, author of The Light of Asia, who soon started advocating for the renovation of the site and its return to Buddhist care. Arnold was directed towards this endeavour by Weligama Sri Sumangala Thera.

At the invitation of Paul Carus, he returned to the U.S. in 1896, and again in 1902–04, where he traveled and taught widely.

Dharmapala eventually broke with Olcott and the Theosophists because of Olcott&#x27;s stance on universal religion. &quot;One of the important factors in his rejection of theosophy centred on this issue of universalism; the price of Buddhism being assimilated into a non-Buddhist model of truth was ultimately too high for him.&quot; Dharmapala stated that Theosophy was &quot;only consolidating Krishna worship.&quot; &quot;To say that all religions have a common foundation only shows the ignorance of the speaker; Dharma alone is supreme to the Buddhist.&quot;

At Sarnath in 1933 he was ordained as a bhikkhu, and he died at Sarnath in December of that year, aged 68.

== Religious work ==
The young Dharmapala helped Colonel Olcott in his work, particularly by acting as his translator. Dharmapala also became quite close to Madame Blavatsky, who advised him to study Pāli and to work for the good of humanity – which is what he did. It was at this time that he changed his name to &quot;Dharmapala&quot; (meaning &quot;Guardian of the Dharma&quot;).

In 1891 Anagarika Dharmapala was on a pilgrimage to the recently restored Mahabodhi Temple, where Siddhartha Gautama – the Buddha – attained enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, India. Here he experienced a shock to find the temple in the hands of a Saivite priest, the Buddha image transformed into a Hindu icon and Buddhists barred from worship. As a result, he began an agitation movement.

The Maha Bodhi Society at Colombo was founded in 1891 but its offices were soon moved to Calcutta the following year in 1892. One of its primary aims was the restoration to Buddhist control of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the chief of the four ancient Buddhist holy sites. To accomplish this, Dharmapala initiated a lawsuit against the Brahmin priests who had held control of the site for centuries. After a protracted struggle, this was successful only after Indian independence (1947) and sixteen years after Dharmapala&#x27;s own death (1933), with the partial restoration of the site to the management of the Maha Bodhi Society in 1949. It was then the temple management of Bodh Gaya was entrusted to a committee comprised in equal numbers of Hindus and Buddhists. A statue of Anagarika Dharmapala was established in College Square near Kolkata Maha Bodhi Society.
Maha Bodhi Society centers were set up in many Indian cities, and this had the effect of raising Indian consciousness about Buddhism. Converts were made mostly among the educated, but also among some low caste Indians in the south.


Due to the efforts of Dharmapala, the site of the Buddha&#x27;s parinibbana (physical death) at Kushinagar has once again become a major attraction for Buddhists, as it was for many centuries previously. Mahabodhi Movement in 1890s held the Muslim rule in India responsible for the decay of Buddhism in India. Anagarika Dharmapala did not hesitate to lay the chief blame for the decline of Buddhism in India at the door of Muslim fanaticism.

In 1893 Dharmapala was invited to attend the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago as a representative of &quot;Southern Buddhism&quot; – which was the term applied at that time to the Theravada. There he met Swami Vivekananda and got on very well with him. Like Swami Vivekananda, he was a great success at the Parliament and received a fair bit of media attention. By his early thirties he was already a global figure, continuing to travel and give lectures and establish viharas around the world during the next forty years. At the same time he concentrated on establishing schools and hospitals in Ceylon and building temples and viharas in India. Among the most important of the temples he built was one at Sarnath, where the Buddha first taught. On returning to India via Hawaii, he met Mary E. Foster, a descendant of King Kamehameha who had emotional problems. Dharmapala consoled her using Buddhist techniques; in return, she granted him an enormous donation of over one million rupees (over $2.7 million in 2010 dollars, but worth much more due to low labor costs in India). In 1897 he converted Miranda de Souza Canavarro who as &quot;Sister Sanghamitta&quot; came to establish a school in Ceylon.

Dharmapala&#x27;s voluminous diaries have been published, and he also wrote some memoirs.

== Dharmapala, science, and Protestant Buddhism ==
The term &#x27;Protestant Buddhism,&#x27; coined by scholar Gananath Obeyesekere, is often applied to Dharmapala&#x27;s form of Buddhism. It is Protestant in two ways. First, it is influenced by Protestant ideals such as freedom from religious institutions, freedom of conscience, and focus on individual interior experience. Second, it is in itself a protest against claims of Christian superiority, colonialism, and Christian missionary work aimed at weakening Buddhism. &quot;Its salient characteristic is the importance it assigns to the laity.&quot; It arose among the new, literate, middle class centred in Colombo.

The term &#x27;Buddhist modernism&#x27; is used to describe forms of Buddhism that suited the Modern World, usually influenced by modern thinking, and often adapted by Buddhists as a counter to claims of European or Christian superiority. Buddhist modernists emphasize certain aspects of traditional Buddhism, while de-emphasizing others. Some of the characteristics of Buddhist modernism are: importance of the laity as against the sangha; rationality and de-emphasis of supernatural and mythological aspects; consistency with (and anticipation of) modern science; emphasis on spontaneity, creativity, and intuition; democratic, anti-institutional character; emphasis on meditation over devotional and ceremonial actions.

Dharmapala is an excellent example of a Buddhist modernist, and perhaps the paradigmatic example of Protestant Buddhism. He was particularly concerned with presenting Buddhism as consistent with science, especially the theory of evolution.

== Survey of writings ==
Most of Dharmapala&#x27;s works are collected in &quot;Return to Righteousness: A Collection of Speeches, Essays, and Letters of the Anagarika Dharmapala&quot;. (Edited by Ananda Guruge. Colombo, Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs (1965)).

=== &quot;The World&#x27;s Debt to The Buddha&quot; (1893) ===

This paper was read to a crowded session of the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago, 18 September 1893. At this early stage of his career, Dharmapala was concerned with making Buddhism palatable to his Western audience. This talk is full of references to science, the European Enlightenment, and Christianity. While presenting Buddhism in these familiar terms, he also hints that it is superior to any philosophy of the West. In addition, he spends considerable time discussing the ideal Buddhist polity under Asoka and the Buddha&#x27;s ethics for lay people.

=== &quot;The Constructive Optimism of Buddhism&quot; (1915) ===
Buddhism was often portrayed in the West, especially by Christian missionaries, as pessimistic, nihilistic, and passive. One of Dharmapala&#x27;s main concerns was to counter such claims, and this concern is especially evident in this essay.

=== &quot;Message of the Buddha&quot; (1925) ===
In the later stages of his career, Dharmapala&#x27;s vociferous anti-Christian tone is more evident. Dharmapala must be understood in the context of British colonization of Ceylon and the presence of Christian missionaries there. This work is a good example of &quot;Protestant Buddhism,&quot; as described above.

=== &quot;Evolution from the Standpoint of Buddhism&quot; (1926) ===
Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution was the cutting edge of science during Dharmapala&#x27;s life. As part of his attempt to show that Buddhism is consistent with modern science, he was especially concerned with evolution.

== Contributions to Sinhalese Buddhist Nationalism ==
Dharmapala was one of the primary contributors to the Buddhist revival of the 19th century that led to the creation of Buddhist institutions to match those of the missionaries (schools, the YMBA, etc.), and to the independence movement of the 20th century. DeVotta characterizes his rhetoric as having four main points: &quot;(i) Praise – for Buddhism and the Sinhalese culture; (ii) Blame – on the British imperialists, those who worked for them including Christians; (iii) Fear – that Buddhism in Sri Lanka was threatened with extinction; and (iv) Hope – for a rejuvenated Sinhalese Buddhist ascendancy&quot; (78). He illustrated the first three points in a public speech:

== Later life ==

In the last years of his life, he visited Ceylon in 1931, during which he established the &#x27;Dharmapala Trust&#x27;. That year he was ordained a Buddhist monk with the name Sri Devamitta Dharmapala. Two years later he took his higher ordination. He died on 29 April 1933 at the Mulagandhakuti Viharaya in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh, India.

== Legacy ==
In 2014, India and Sri Lanka issued postage stamps to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Dharmapala, along with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka which issued a commemorative coin. In Colombo, a road has been named in his honour as &quot;Anagarika Dharmapala Mawatha&quot; (Angarika Dharmapala Street).

The biographical film, &quot;Anagarika Dharmapala Srimathano&quot;, on life history of Dharamapala was released in 2014, where Palitha Silva played the role.

<doc id="585379" wikidata="Q645787" url="?curid=585379" title="Socialist Party (Belgium)">
<text>The Socialist Party (, , PS) is a social democratic French-speaking political party in Belgium. As of the 2024 elections, it is the fourth largest party in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives and the second largest Francophone party. The party is led by Paul Magnette. The party supplies the Minister-president of the French Community (Rudy Demotte), and the Brussels-Capital Region (Rudi Vervoort). In the German-speaking community, the party is known as the &quot;Sozialistische Partei&quot; (SP).

The PS is very commonly part of governing coalitions, and dominates most local authorities because of the extremely fragmented nature of Belgian political institutions, particularly in Francophone areas. In the years since 1999, the PS has simultaneously controlled five regional executive bodies: the Government of the French Community, the Walloon Government, the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region, as well as the COCOF, a local subsidiary in Brussels of the French Community Government, and the Government of the German-speaking Community.

The party, or its members, have from time to time been brought into connection with criminal activities and political scandals, mostly concerning bribery and financial fraud (Cools assassination, Agusta scandal, Dassault Affair, Carolorégienne affair, ICDI affair). The Carolorégienne affair caused Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe to step down as Minister-President of the Walloon region.

== Electoral results ==
The PS performed well in the 2003 general election but were overtaken as the largest Francophone party by the Reformist Movement in the 2007 general election.

In the 10 June 2007 general elections, the party won 20 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and 4 out of 40 seats in the Senate. The PS was a member of the Leterme I Government, Van Rompuy I Government, Leterme II Government and currently the Di Rupo I Government of 6 December 2011, with former PS leader Elio Di Rupo serving as Prime Minister of Belgium.

<doc id="585383" wikidata="Q203337" url="?curid=585383" title="Pulmonology">
<text>Pulmonology (, , from Latin &quot;pulmō, -ōnis&quot; &quot;lung&quot; and the Greek suffix &quot;study of&quot;), pneumology (, built on Greek πνεύμων &quot;lung&quot;) or pneumonology () is a medical specialty that deals with diseases involving the respiratory tract. It is also known as respirology, respiratory medicine, or chest medicine in some countries and areas.

Pulmonology is considered a branch of internal medicine, and is related to intensive care medicine. Pulmonology often involves managing patients who need life support and mechanical ventilation. Pulmonologists are specially trained in diseases and conditions of the chest, particularly pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, emphysema, and complicated chest infections.

Pulmonology/respirology departments work especially closely with certain other specialties: cardiothoracic surgery departments and cardiology departments.

== Journals of pulmonology ==
* American Association for Respiratory Care
* American College of Chest Physicians
* American Lung Association
* American Thoracic Society
* British Thoracic Society
* European Respiratory Society

== History of pulmonology ==
One of the first major discoveries relevant to the field of pulmonology was the discovery of pulmonary circulation. Originally, it was thought that blood reaching the right side of the heart passed through small &#x27;pores&#x27; in the septum into the left side to be oxygenated, as theorized by Galen; however, the discovery of pulmonary circulation disproves this theory, which had previously been accepted since the 2nd century. Thirteenth-century anatomist and physiologist Ibn Al-Nafis accurately theorized that there was no &#x27;direct&#x27; passage between the two sides (ventricles) of the heart. He believed that the blood must have passed through the pulmonary artery, through the lungs, and back into the heart to be pumped around the body. This is believed by many to be the first scientific description of pulmonary circulation.

Although pulmonary medicine only began to evolve as a medical specialty in the 1950s, William Welch and William Osler founded the &#x27;parent&#x27; organization of the American Thoracic Society, the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis. The care, treatment, and study of tuberculosis of the lung is recognised as a discipline in its own right, phthisiology. When the specialty did begin to evolve, several discoveries were being made linking the respiratory system and the measurement of arterial blood gases, attracting more and more physicians and researchers to the developing field.

== Pulmonology and its relevance in other medical fields ==
Surgery of the respiratory tract is generally performed by specialists in cardiothoracic surgery (or thoracic surgery), though minor procedures may be performed by pulmonologists. Pulmonology is closely related to critical care medicine when dealing with patients who require mechanical ventilation. As a result, many pulmonologists are certified to practice critical care medicine in addition to pulmonary medicine. There are fellowship programs that allow physicians to become board certified in pulmonary and critical care medicine simultaneously. Interventional pulmonology is a relatively new field within pulmonary medicine that deals with the use of procedures such as bronchoscopy and pleuroscopy to treat several pulmonary diseases. Interventional pulmonology is increasingly recognized as a specific medical specialty.

== Diagnosis ==
The pulmonologist begins the diagnostic process with a general review focusing on:
* hereditary diseases affecting the lungs (cystic fibrosis, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency)
* exposure to toxicants (tobacco smoke, asbestos, exhaust fumes, coal mining fumes, e-cigarette aerosol,)
* exposure to infectious agents (certain types of birds, malt processing)
* an autoimmune diathesis that might predispose to certain conditions (pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension)

Physical diagnostics are as important as in other fields of medicine.
* Inspection of the hands for signs of cyanosis or clubbing, chest wall, and respiratory rate.
* Palpation of the cervical lymph nodes, trachea and chest wall movement.
* Percussion of the lung fields for dullness or hyper-resonance.
* Auscultation (with a stethoscope) of the lung fields for diminished or unusual breath sounds.
** Rales or rhonchi heard over lung fields with a stethoscope.

As many heart diseases can give pulmonary signs, a thorough cardiac investigation is usually included.

==Procedures==

=== Clinical procedures ===
Pulmonary clinical procedures include the following pulmonary tests and procedures:
* Medical laboratory investigation of blood (blood tests). Sometimes arterial blood gas tests are also required.
* Spirometry the determination of maximum airflow at a given lung volume as measured by breathing into a dedicated machine; this is the key test to diagnose airflow obstruction.
* Pulmonary function testing including spirometry, as above, plus response to bronchodilators, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity, the latter being a measure of lung oxygen absorptive area
* Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endobronchial and transbronchial biopsy and epithelial brushing
* Chest X-rays
* CT scan
* Scintigraphy and other methods of nuclear medicine
* Positron emission tomography (especially in lung cancer)
* Polysomnography (sleep studies) commonly used for the diagnosis of sleep apnea

=== Surgical procedures ===
Major surgical procedures on the heart and lungs are performed by a thoracic surgeon. Pulmonologists often perform specialized procedures to get samples from the inside of the chest or inside of the lung. They use radiographic techniques to view vasculature of the lungs and heart to assist with diagnosis.

== Treatment and therapeutics ==
Medication is the most important treatment of most diseases of pulmonology, either by inhalation (bronchodilators and steroids) or in oral form (antibiotics, leukotriene antagonists). A common example being the usage of inhalers in the treatment of inflammatory lung conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Oxygen therapy is often necessary in severe respiratory disease (emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis). When this is insufficient, the patient might require mechanical ventilation.

Pulmonary rehabilitation has been defined as a multidimensional continuum of services directed to persons with pulmonary disease and their families, usually by an interdisciplinary team of specialists, with the goal of achieving and maintaining the individual&#x27;s maximum level of independence and functioning in the community. Pulmonary rehabilitation is intended to educate the patient, the family, and improve the overall quality of life and prognosis for the patient. Interventions can include exercise, education, emotional support, oxygen, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, optimization of airway secretion clearance, promoting compliance with medical care to reduce numbers of exacerbations and hospitalizations, and returning to work and/or a more active and emotionally satisfying life. These goals are appropriate for any patients with diminished respiratory reserve whether due to obstructive or intrinsic pulmonary diseases (oxygenation impairment) or neuromuscular weakness (ventilatory impairment). A pulmonary rehabilitation team may include a rehabilitation physician, a pulmonary medicine specialist, physician assistant and allied health professionals including a rehabilitation nurse, a respiratory therapist, a speech-language pathologist, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a psychologist, and a social worker among others. Additionally, breathing games are used to motivate children to perform pulmonary rehabilitation.

== Education and training ==

=== Pulmonologist ===
In the United States, pulmonologists are physicians who, after receiving a medical degree (MD or DO), complete residency training in internal medicine, followed by at least two additional years of subspeciality fellowship training in pulmonology. After satisfactorily completing a fellowship in pulmonary medicine, the physician is permitted to take the board certification examination in pulmonary medicine. After passing this exam, the physician is then board certified as a pulmonologist. Most pulmonologists complete three years of combined subspecialty fellowship training in pulmonary medicine and critical care medicine.

=== Pediatric pulmonologist ===
In the United States, pediatric pulmonologists are physicians who, after receiving a medical degree (MD, DO, MBBS, MBBCh, etc.), complete residency training in pediatrics, followed by at least three additional years of subspeciality fellowship training in pulmonology. Pediatric pulmonologists treat diseases of the airways, lungs, respiratory mechanics and aerodigestive system.

== Scientific research ==
Pulmonologists are involved in both clinical and basic research of the respiratory system, ranging from the anatomy of the respiratory epithelium to the most effective treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Scientific research also takes place to look for causes and possible treatment in diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer.

<doc id="585384" wikidata="Q4439259" url="?curid=585384" title="Stalky &amp; Co.">
<text>Stalky &amp; Co. is a novel by Rudyard Kipling about adolescent boys at a British boarding school. It is a collection of school stories whose three juvenile protagonists display a know-it-all, cynical outlook on patriotism and authority. It was first published in 1899 after the stories had appeared in magazines during the previous two years. It is set at a school dubbed &quot;the College&quot; or &quot;the Coll.&quot;, which is based on the actual United Services College that Kipling attended as a boy.

The stories have elements of revenge, the macabre, bullying and violence, and hints about sex, making them far from childish or idealised. For example, Beetle pokes fun at an earlier, more earnest, boys&#x27; book, &quot;Eric, or, Little by Little&quot;, thus flaunting his more worldly outlook. The final chapter recounts events in the lives of the boys when, as adults, they are in the armed forces in India. It is implied that the mischievous pranks of the boys in school were splendid training for their role as instruments of the British Empire.

George Orwell wrote in 1940 that &quot;Stalky&quot; had &quot;had an immense influence on boys&#x27; literature&quot;.

== Characters ==
===Boys===
* &quot;Stalky&quot; (real name: Arthur Lionel Corkran). He knows that he is destined for Sandhurst, so he does not care about many academic subjects. Stalky later turns out to be brilliant in battle. He is based on Lionel Dunsterville.
* Reginald (or Reggie) Beetle, based on Kipling himself.
* William &quot;Turkey&quot; M&#x27;Turk (pronounced McTurk; he comes from a landed estate in Ireland). He is based on George Charles Beresford.

===Staff===
* Mr. Bates - the Headmaster, always wise and usually firm. Based on Cormell Price, headmaster of the United Services College.
* Mr. Prout – a housemaster in charge of Stalky&#x27;s House, the victim of many of their deceptions
* Mr. King – a housemaster who sometimes bedevils the boys; &quot;generally held to be based on W. C. Crofts,&quot; plus F. W. Haslam 
* Mr. Hartopp – a housemaster, President of the Natural History Society; he seldom comes into conflict with the three boys and is more objective about them than Prout or King
* the Reverend John Gillett – the school&#x27;s chaplain, who understands the three boys and has friendly chats with them
* Foxy – a &quot;subtle red-haired school Sergeant&quot;

== Contents with summaries ==
The novel is a compilation of nine previously published stories, with a prefatory untitled poem beginning &quot;Let us now praise famous men&quot; (Sirach 44:1).

Several of the stories appeared in more than one magazine before being collected in book form. The stories are listed below in the order in which they appeared in the book, along with the date and location of their magazine appearances:

* &quot;In Ambush&quot; (August 1898, &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot;; December, 1898, &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot;): The three boys, reading and smoking in their &quot;bunker&quot; (hide-out), see a gamekeeper shooting a fox, something anathema in a place where foxhunting is practised. When M&#x27;Turk tells the keeper&#x27;s employer, a colonel who owns land adjoining their school, he gratefully invites them to visit his land. Later Sergeant Foxy, Mr. King, and Mr. Prout follow the boys to see what they&#x27;re up to when far from the school, and Stalky leads them onto the colonel&#x27;s land. The colonel upbraids them for trespassing, amusing the boys, who are eavesdropping. Though the Head finds out that the boys are technically innocent, he canes them for causing trouble.
* &quot;Slaves of the Lamp, Part I.&quot; (April 1897, &quot;&quot;;): While the three boys and the three in the study (private room) below are rehearsing a pantomime of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, Mr. King interrupts, as he has found lampoons Beetle wrote about him. He takes Beetle to his study and reprimands him in front of the younger boy who showed King the verses. By shooting a drunken carter with a catapult, Stalky induces him to throw stones at King. Beetle takes the opportunity to increase the damage that the stones do to King&#x27;s study and to the tale-bearer.
* &quot;An Unsavoury Interlude&quot; (January, 1899, &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Windsor Magazine&quot;): Mr. King taunts Beetle for having formerly been afraid of bathing in the sea, leading the boys of King&#x27;s house (dormitory) to taunt those of Prout&#x27;s house as &quot;stinkers&quot;. With the help of architectural knowledge Beetle has recently learned, the boys put a cat that they killed above the ceiling in King&#x27;s house, causing a real stink, to King&#x27;s house&#x27;s much greater embarrassment.
* &quot;The Impressionists&quot; (February, 1899, &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Windsor Magazine&quot;): Mr. Prout evicts the three boys from their study because each has been doing the others&#x27; work in the classes that he is good at. They give the impression of conspiracies, intrigues, and systematic usury in the house till he sends them back to their study to get them away from the other pupils.
* &quot;The Moral Reformers&quot; (March, 1899, &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Windsor Magazine&quot;): The Rev. John Gillett suggests that the three boys protect a small boy who is being bullied. They trick the bullies (two older boys) into letting themselves be tied up for a game, and in a scene that has horrified many readers, torment the bullies without mercy until they convincingly agree to behave themselves.
* A Little Prep.&quot; (April, 1899, &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Windsor Magazine&quot;): The Head catches the three boys out of bounds and smoking and has them caned, and they intend revenge. Some Old Boys (former pupils) visit at the end of the term. One of them, Crandall, an army officer in India, had seen another Old Boy die after a skirmish. The Head has Crandall sleep in his old dormitory, and boys crowd in to hear his story. To punish them for leaving their beds, the Head has them do prep. (study) on the last night. The pupils riot. The three boys had learned that when the Head had happened upon them out of bounds, he had been out to save another pupil from diphtheria by sucking the pseudo-membrane out of his throat, at great risk to the Head&#x27;s life. They spread the report of the Head&#x27;s heroism. When he comes to stop the rioting, all the pupils cheer him incessantly despite his punishment.
* &quot;The Flag of Their Country&quot; (May 1899, &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot;; July, 1899, &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot;): A general on the College&#x27;s Board of Council sees Sergeant Foxy drilling boys, including Stalky and Beetle, as a punishment for lateness. He thinks they&#x27;re drilling voluntarily and decides the school should have a well-equipped cadet-corps. A number of boys participate enthusiastically to prepare for their intended careers as military officers. However, a Member of Parliament is invited to give a speech on &#x27;patriotism&#x27; to the school. He tactlessly outrages the boys&#x27; deep and private feelings about their military families and future, culminating by waving a Union Jack, an action which baffles them. Led by Stalky, the members of the cadet-corps quit the next morning.
* &quot;The Last Term&quot; (May, 1899, &quot;Windsor Magazine&quot;): The three boys enjoy flirting with and kissing a local young woman, Mary Yeo. When a shy and intellectual prefect named Tulke sees them, they persuade Mary to kiss him. The prefects try to criticise the three for immorality, but they turn the tables by reporting Tulke&#x27;s &quot;immorality&quot; and suggesting that the other prefects are conspiring with him. The three boys grudgingly agree not to tell the rest of the school, but do so on the last day, when they&#x27;re leaving but the prefects will be back.
* &quot;Slaves of the Lamp, Part II.&quot; (May 1897, &quot;&quot;): The characters are now about thirty, and most are civil servants or soldiers in India. All the participants in the Aladdin pantomime except Stalky reunite in England at the estate of a friend (&quot;the Infant&quot;, who narrated Kipling&#x27;s story &quot;A Conference of the Powers&quot;). They tell Beetle (the narrator of this story) how Stalky, an army captain, got his small force out of a siege by shooting at his enemies to get them to fight each other, as he had got the carter to throw stones at Mr. King; meanwhile Stalky used his charisma and language skills to keep his Sikh and Pathan allies together and then to set himself up as almost a local ruler.

===Other stories===

An expanded version of &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot; called &quot;The Complete Stalky and Co.&quot; was published in 1929. It contains all of the stories in the 1899 book plus five more, most of which had appeared in magazines in the 1920s. They appear in the following order:

* &quot;Stalky&quot; (originally published 1898, collected in &quot;Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides&quot; in 1923). Several pupils at the Coll. are caught and locked in a barn while trying to steal cattle for fun. Corkran leads Beetle and M&#x27;Turk in rescuing them and locking the farmhands in the barn. The boys change Corkran&#x27;s nickname &quot;Corky&quot; to &quot;Stalky&quot; (which rhymes with it in the non-rhotic accents of England, and is based on their slang &quot;to stalk&quot;, meaning &quot;to use clever tactics, to outwit others&quot;). Kipling describes &quot;Stalky&quot; as the first of the Stalky &amp; Co tales to be written: it was originally published in &quot;The Windsor Magazine&quot; and &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1898.
* &quot;In Ambush&quot;
* &quot;Slaves of the Lamp (Part I)&quot;
* &quot;An Unsavoury Interlude&quot;
* &quot;The Impressionists&quot;
* &quot;The Moral Reformers&quot;
* &quot;The United Idolaters&quot; (1924, collected in &quot;Debits and Credits&quot; in 1926): A school fad for the Uncle Remus stories leads to wilder and wilder behaviour until a climactic fight between King&#x27;s house, with a terrapin painted in their colours, and Prout&#x27;s house, with a tar baby improvised by Stalky, Beetle, and M&#x27;Turk. As the school is nearly set on fire, the Head punishes many pupils. A new master obsessed with the possibility of homosexuality at the school thinks the Tar Baby was indecent, and the resulting quarrel with the other masters ends with his resignation.
* &quot;Regulus&quot; (1917, collected in &quot;A Diversity of Creatures&quot; in 1917): In Latin class, Mr. King speaks enthusiastically about Horace&#x27;s Ode III.5, which tells how the general Regulus took a message of war to Carthage though he knew that the Carthaginians would kill him. A normally serious boy releases a mouse in a class. Teased by other boys about his forthcoming punishment, he goes berserk (Beetle&#x27;s diagnosis) and fights one of them viciously. He accepts his punishments without trying to delay or diminish them, so Stalky compares him to Regulus—giving King ammunition in arguing to the science teacher Hartopp that the pupils learn valuable things from Latin.
* &quot;A Little Prep.&quot;
* &quot;The Flag of Their Country&quot;
* &quot;The Propagation of Knowledge&quot; (1926, collected in &quot;Debits and Credits&quot;): In King&#x27;s class, Beetle guides M&#x27;Turk in bringing up the theory that Francis Bacon wrote the plays ascribed to Shakespeare, which distracts King, as he loathes it. An examiner for the Army comes to the school. After Beetle and M&#x27;Turk elicit hints that he supports the Baconian theory, various boys pretend interest in it, getting high marks. King endures the examiner&#x27;s praise of his pupils.
* &quot;The Satisfaction of a Gentleman&quot; (1920): Beetle and one of the &quot;Aladdin&quot; players have a war of pranks. They conclude with a duel that turns into a chaotic battle on the nearby golf course using guns loaded with dust shot (very small shotgun pellets). As Beetle flees, he collides with an elderly golfer who turns out to be on the school&#x27;s Council. The Head canes Beetle, Stalky, and M&#x27;Turk to appease him.
* &quot;The Last Term&quot;
* &quot;Slaves of the Lamp (Part II)&quot;

Other Stalky stories:

*&quot;A Deal in Cotton&quot;: Stalky only listens to and comments on the main character&#x27;s narration. Collected in &quot;Actions and Reactions&quot;.
*&quot;The Honours of War&quot; (1917 in &quot;A Diversity of Creatures&quot;): Stalky (now a lieutenant-colonel) and Beetle learn that two subalterns are in trouble for playing pranks on a fellow subaltern named Wontner, including abducting him to the Infant&#x27;s mansion. As Wontner intends to create a scandal that will end their careers, Stalky diverts him by helping to tie up and embarrass the pranksters, after which Wontner is as guilty as they are.

== Criticism ==

When the stories were published, some critics praised them, including most of those in the daily papers. The &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, for example, emphasised the stories&#x27; humour and realism. On the other hand, many reviews were harsh, notably Robert Buchanan&#x27;s essay on Kipling in &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot;, in which Buchanan saw Kipling&#x27;s work as a sign of British culture&#x27;s reversion to barbarism, and said of the book, &quot;The vulgarity, the brutality, the savagery reeks on every page.&quot;

Henry James called the book &quot;deplorable&quot;; Somerset Maugham, &quot;odious&quot;. Teddy Roosevelt said it was &quot;a story which ought never to have been written, for there is hardly a single form of meanness which it does not seem to extol, or of school mismanagement which it does not seem to applaud.&quot; Other harsh criticisms have come from George Sampson in &quot;The Concise Cambridge History of English Literature&quot;, A. C. Benson, and Edmund Wilson. H. G. Wells called Stalky and his friends &quot;mucky little sadists&quot;. In his &quot;Outline of History&quot;, noting that a master incites the three boys to bully the two bullies with &quot;gusto&quot; (shared by the author) and that the Head seems to approve it, he saw authority and supposed morality as the typical justification for cruelty. He added, &quot;In this we have the key to the ugliest, most retrogressive, and finally fatal idea of modern imperialism; the idea of &quot;a tacit conspiracy between the law and illegal violence&quot;.&quot; [Italics in original.] He compared the boys&#x27; actions to the Black Hundreds&#x27; massacres in tsarist Russia, the Jameson Raid, and &quot;the adventures of Sir Edward Carson and F. E. Smith (now Lord Birkenhead) in Ireland&quot;. On the other hand, Richard Le Gallienne called it &quot;perhaps the best school story ever written&quot; and replied to its detractors by quoting the story &quot;An Unsavoury Interlude&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s not brutality... It&#x27;s boy; only boy.&quot;

== Language and allusions ==
The stories contain a good deal of language, from slang and Devon dialect to legal Latin, that is unfamiliar to modern readers, especially those outside Britain. Also Kipling portrays the boys as being widely read in the literature available to them. Their casual talk includes Latin and French (often distorted), not unusual for schoolboys of the time, and they quote or purposefully misquote classical authors such as Cicero and Horace. At least two editions have provided notes to help modern readers understand these words and references. Allusions include:

* &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot;
* &quot;Eric, or, Little by Little&quot; (referred to often in mockery) Example: &quot;Wasn&#x27;t it glorious? Didn&#x27;t I &quot;Eric&quot; &#x27;em splendidly?&quot; (&quot;Stalky&quot;: Ch. 8, &quot;The Last Term&quot;)
* &quot;Fors Clavigera&quot;, by John Ruskin
* &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot;, by Edgar Allan Poe
* &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, by Lewis Carroll. M&#x27;Turk uses the word &quot;frabjous&quot; on two occasions, one of them in a direct quotation, and Stalky uses it once.
* A &quot;Jorrocks&quot; novel, probably &quot;Handley Cross&quot; (1843), by Robert Smith Surtees. Stalky quotes the line, &quot;Hellish dark and smells of cheese.&quot; (&quot;Stalky&quot;: Ch. 8, &quot;The Last Term&quot;)
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, by William Shakespeare. When Beetle points out Tulke&#x27;s embarrassing admission that he couldn&#x27;t stop a girl from kissing him, Stalky adds, &quot;And Tulkus [...] is an honourable man.&quot; 
* &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, by James Fenimore Cooper. In the story &quot;In Ambush&quot;, Beetle twice calls Sgt. Foxy &quot;Chingachgook&quot;.
* &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, by Charles Dickens (an allusion to Fagin)
* &quot;Uncle Remus and His Legends of the Old Plantation&quot;, by Joel Chandler Harris, London edition, 1881. The principal basis for &quot;The United Idolaters.&quot;
* &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, by E. Nesbit

==Posthumously published manuscript==
Kipling wrote an additional story about Stalky and Co., &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot;, that remained unpublished in his lifetime. It depicts Stalky and his friends catching a colonel cheating at golf near Appledore in North Devon. The story existed only in manuscript form, attached to the end of the original manuscript of &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot;: it may have been planned as the opening chapter. On his death in 1936 Kipling bequeathed the manuscript to the Imperial Service Trust, the body that administered the Imperial Service College (successor institution to the United Services College). That school merged with Haileybury in 1942 to form Haileybury and Imperial Service College. The manuscript was displayed at Haileybury in 1962, in an exhibition to mark the school&#x27;s centenary; and in 1989, after spending many years in a bank vault, was transferred to the College archives.

While &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot; was known to exist, it had never been transcribed or widely discussed. It was &quot;discovered&quot; in 2004 by Jeremy Lewins, a former Kipling Fellow at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The school subsequently decided to publish it, in association with the Kipling Society.

==Television adaptation==
The tales were adapted for television by the BBC in 1982. The six-part series starred Robert Addie as Stalky and David Parfitt as Beetle. It was directed by Rodney Bennett and produced by Barry Letts.

<doc id="585388" wikidata="Q1502277" url="?curid=585388" title="Homology sphere">
<text>In algebraic topology, a homology sphere is an &quot;n&quot;-manifold &quot;X&quot; having the homology groups of an &quot;n&quot;-sphere, for some integer formula_1. That is,

:formula_2 

and

:formula_3 for all other &quot;i&quot;.

Therefore &quot;X&quot; is a connected space, with one non-zero higher Betti number, namely, formula_4. It does not follow that &quot;X&quot; is simply connected, only that its fundamental group is perfect (see Hurewicz theorem).

A rational homology sphere is defined similarly but using homology with rational coefficients.

==Poincaré homology sphere==

The Poincaré homology sphere (also known as Poincaré dodecahedral space) is a particular example of a homology sphere, first constructed by Henri Poincaré. Being a spherical 3-manifold, it is the only homology 3-sphere (besides the 3-sphere itself) with a finite fundamental group. Its fundamental group is known as the binary icosahedral group and has order 120. Since the fundamental group of the 3-sphere is trivial, this shows that there exist 3-manifolds with the same homology groups as the 3-sphere that are not homeomorphic to it.

===Construction===
A simple construction of this space begins with a dodecahedron. Each face of the dodecahedron is identified with its opposite face, using the minimal clockwise twist to line up the faces. Gluing each pair of opposite faces together using this identification yields a closed 3-manifold. (See Seifert–Weber space for a similar construction, using more &quot;twist&quot;, that results in a hyperbolic 3-manifold.)

Alternatively, the Poincaré homology sphere can be constructed as the quotient space SO(3)/I where I is the icosahedral group (i.e., the rotational symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron, isomorphic to the alternating group A5). More intuitively, this means that the Poincaré homology sphere is the space of all geometrically distinguishable positions of an icosahedron (with fixed center and diameter) in Euclidean 3-space. One can also pass instead to the universal cover of SO(3) which can be realized as the group of unit quaternions and is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. In this case, the Poincaré homology sphere is isomorphic to formula_5 where formula_6 is the binary icosahedral group, the perfect double cover of I embedded in formula_7.

Another approach is by Dehn surgery. The Poincaré homology sphere results from +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot.

===Cosmology===
In 2003, lack of structure on the largest scales (above 60 degrees) in the cosmic microwave background as observed for one year by the WMAP spacecraft led to the suggestion, by Jean-Pierre Luminet of the Observatoire de Paris and colleagues, that the shape of the universe is a Poincaré sphere. In 2008, astronomers found the best orientation on the sky for the model and confirmed some of the predictions of the model, using three years of observations by the WMAP spacecraft.
Data analysis from the Planck spacecraft suggests that there is no observable non-trivial topology to the universe.

==Constructions and examples==

*Surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere &quot;S&quot;3 with framing +1 or −1 gives a homology sphere.
*More generally, surgery on a link gives a homology sphere whenever the matrix given by intersection numbers (off the diagonal) and framings (on the diagonal) has determinant +1 or −1.
*If &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; are pairwise relatively prime positive integers then the link of the singularity &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; + &quot;y&quot;&quot;q&quot; + &quot;z&quot;&quot;r&quot; = 0 (in other words, the intersection of a small 3-sphere around 0 with this complex surface) is a Brieskorn manifold that is a homology 3-sphere, called a Brieskorn 3-sphere Σ(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;). It is homeomorphic to the standard 3-sphere if one of &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; is 1, and Σ(2, 3, 5) is the Poincaré sphere.
*The connected sum of two oriented homology 3-spheres is a homology 3-sphere. A homology 3-sphere that cannot be written as a connected sum of two homology 3-spheres is called irreducible or prime, and every homology 3-sphere can be written as a connected sum of prime homology 3-spheres in an essentially unique way. (See Prime decomposition (3-manifold).)
*Suppose that formula_8 are integers all at least 2 such that any two are coprime. Then the Seifert fiber space

:: formula_9

:over the sphere with exceptional fibers of degrees &quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;r&quot; is a homology sphere, where the &quot;b&quot;&#x27;s are chosen so that

:: formula_10

:(There is always a way to choose the &quot;b&quot;′s, and the homology sphere does not depend (up to isomorphism) on the choice of &quot;b&quot;′s.) If &quot;r&quot; is at most 2 this is just the usual 3-sphere; otherwise they are distinct non-trivial homology spheres. If the &quot;a&quot;′s are 2, 3, and 5 this gives the Poincaré sphere. If there are at least 3 &quot;a&quot;′s, not 2, 3, 5, then this is an acyclic homology 3-sphere with infinite fundamental group that has a Thurston geometry modeled on the universal cover of SL2(R).

==Invariants==
*The Rokhlin invariant is a formula_11-valued invariant of homology 3-spheres.
*The Casson invariant is an integer valued invariant of homology 3-spheres, whose reduction mod 2 is the Rokhlin invariant.

==Applications==
If &quot;A&quot; is a homology 3-sphere not homeomorphic to the standard 3-sphere, then the suspension of &quot;A&quot; is an example of a 4-dimensional homology manifold that is not a topological manifold. The double suspension of &quot;A&quot; is homeomorphic to the standard 5-sphere, but its triangulation (induced by some triangulation of &quot;A&quot;) is not a PL manifold. In other words, this gives an example of a finite simplicial complex that is a topological manifold but not a PL manifold. (It is not a PL manifold because the link of a point is not always a 4-sphere.)

Galewski and Stern showed that all compact topological manifolds (without boundary) of dimension at least 5 are homeomorphic to simplicial complexes if and only if there is a homology 3 sphere Σ with Rokhlin invariant 1 such that the connected sum Σ#Σ of Σ with itself bounds a smooth acyclic 4-manifold. Ciprian Manolescu showed that there is no such homology sphere with the given property, and therefore, there are 5-manifolds not homeomorphic to simplicial complexes. In particular, the example originally given by Galewski and Stern is not triangulable.

<text>Johann Balthasar Neumann (; c. 27 January 1687 – 19 August 1753), usually known as Balthasar Neumann, was a German architect and military artillery engineer who developed a refined brand of Baroque architecture, fusing Austrian, Bohemian, Italian, and French elements to design some of the most impressive buildings of the period, including the Würzburg Residence and the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers (called &quot;Vierzehnheiligen&quot; in German).

The Würzburg Residence is considered one of the most beautiful and well proportioned palaces in Europe and the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers is considered by some as the crowning work of the period.

==Early life==

Neumann is believed to have been born on 27 January 1687 in Eger, Kingdom of Bohemia (today Cheb, Czech Republic), the seventh of nine children of cloth-maker Hans Christoph Neumann (d. 1713) and his wife Rosina (1645–1707). Neumann was baptized on 30 January 1687. His first apprenticeship was spent working at a bell and gun foundry in Eger. However, during his Journeyman years he came to Würzburg in 1711. In 1712, he attended lessons on geometry, architecture and land surveying and joined the local military, in which he remained until his death, then holding the rank of colonel of the artillery. He created measurement instruments (1712, Deutsches Museum/Munich and 1713, Mainfränkisches Museum, Würzburg), a map of Würzburg (1715, copy at the War Archive, Munich) and some drawings for a new abbey at Ebrach Abbey (1716, now lost).

In 1717, he served in the Austro–Turkish War, advancing with his unit from Vienna to Belgrade. In 1718, he travelled through northern Italy to study buildings and briefly worked on civilian construction projects at Milan (details not known).

==Service for the Prince-Bishops of Würzburg==

Neumann&#x27;s career as an architect took off under Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn, Prince-Bishop of Würzburg, who asked the young engineer in 1719 to plan, and in 1720 to lead construction of, his new palace, the Würzburg Residence. Although other architects participated, Neumann was able to give the project his personal imprint, which became his life&#x27;s work.

The second task for the Prince-Bishop was the &quot;Schönbornkapelle&quot; of Würzburg Cathedral (from 1721). In 1723 Neumann traveled and studied in France. At Paris and Versailles he met with royal architects Germain Boffrand and Robert de Cotte and consulted them on the Würzburg projects. Back at Würzburg, Neumann started to build a hunting lodge known as Mädelhofen (1724, unfinished, demolished in 1725).

In 1725, Neumann married Maria Eva Engelberts (b. 1704 – d. 1745); they had three sons and 5 daughters.

Under von Schönborn&#x27;s successor, Christoph Franz von Hutten (1673–1729) he was less busy at Wurzburg and mainly worked for various abbeys. His new church at Münsterschwarzach Abbey (after 1727, demolished after 1821) laid the groundwork for his fame as a builder of churches. Another work of this period was the church at Kloster Holzkirchen (1728–30) where he combined features of the French, Italian and German Baroque.

The next Prince-Bishop was Friedrich Karl von Schönborn (1674–1746), who also was Prince-Bishop of Bamberg. As &quot;Reichsvizekanzler&quot; von Schönborn lived at the imperial court at Vienna until 1734. He named Neumann director of all military, civilian and ecclesiastical construction in both bishoprics and in 1729 and 1739 ordered him to Vienna, where he exchanged views with Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, von Schönborn&#x27;s architect, whose influence is visible in some parts of the Residence and also at the hunting lodge of Werneck (after 1733).

As chief engineer of the joint &quot;Hochstifts&quot;, Neumann was responsible for overseeing fortifications, transport and water engineering and for improving urban planning in practical and aesthetical terms. From 1731, he also taught military and civilian architecture at Würzburg University.

Neumann also worked for Damian Hugo Philipp von Schönborn (1676–1743) and Franz Georg von Schönborn (1682–1756). Neumann built the &quot;Corps de Logis&quot; of the Schloss Bruchsal (after 1731), with its notable stairway. In the same town, he also designed the church of St. Peter (1740–1746) which was to be the burial site for the Prince-Bishops of Speyer. Among his work for the Elector of Trier are the &quot;Dikasterialgebäude&quot; of Ehrenbreitstein Fortress (1739–1748) and the summer palace Schönbornslust (1748–1752, demolished 1806) at Kesselheim, also near Koblenz.

This work, in turn, led to Neumann being contacted for further work in the west of Germany. Out of many mooted projects only the stairway and New Apartments of the Brühl Palace (from 1743). Plans he made for the ducal palace at Stuttgart (after 1747), for Schwetzingen Palace (1749) and the Residence at Karlsruhe (after 1750) were never implemented.
As a builder of churches, Neumann recurred to Guarino Guarini, the architecture of his native Bohemia and its transmittance to Franconia by Johann Dientzenhofer. He emphasized the use of the rotunda as a central feature of his churches. This reached its pinnacle at &quot;Vierzehnheiligen&quot; (after 1742) and Neresheim (after 1747).

One of his last large projects was a rebuilding of the Hofburg Palace at Vienna (after 1746), which was not put into practice, however.

Neumann worked on St. Paulinus&#x27; Church in Trier, designing most of the internal elements.

==Death and legacy==

He died in Würzburg on 19 August 1753 and is buried at the &quot;Marienkapelle&quot; there. The final German 50 Deutsche Mark note showed a picture of him together with the famous staircase located in the Residence of Würzburg. Neumann was also depicted by Tiepolo in the ceiling fresco above the stairway of the Residence, in pseudo-military uniform, leaning over a cannon. He had boasted that the ceiling was so well constructed that not even the roar of a cannon would make the roof fall.

<text>Serang Regency (Sundanese: ) is a regency of Banten province, Indonesia. It is located in the northwest corner of the island of Java. The administrative center of the regency is at Ciruas, while the capital of the province is the independent municipality of Serang (&quot;Kota Serang&quot;) which was split off the regency on 17 July 2007.

Serang municipality is about 10 km from Old Banten, the eponymous former sultanate&#x27;s capital. Merak, a major port and ferry terminal, is located at the northwest tip of Java, within the independent municipality of Cilegon, which was split off from the regency on 20 April 1999. Serang Regency and its semi-enclaved cities have experienced a heavy influx of residents as Jakarta continues its outward growth; some planning agencies consider it to be part of the metropolitan area. It shares its eastern border with Tangerang Regency of Jabodetabek.

Serang Regency covers an area of 1,369.91 km2, and had a population of 1,402,818 at the 2010 Census and 1,622,630 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,730,532. Including Cilegon and Serang cities which the regency surrounds on their landward sides, the mid 2023 population amounted to 2,936,561 inhabiting 1,795.58 km2, for an overall density of 1,635.4 per km2. Both Cilegon and Serang cities are semi-enclaves within Serang Regency.

Serang Regency is bounded by Java Sea to the north, Sunda Strait to the west, Tangerang Regency of Greater Jakarta to the east, Lebak Regency and Pandeglang Regency to the south.

== Administrative districts ==
As at time of the 2010 Census, the Regency was divided into twenty-eight districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;). However, an additional district - Lebakwangi - was created in 2017 from the southeastern part of Pontang District and other neighbouring districts. The districts are tabulated below with their current areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages (all classed as &quot;desa&quot;) within each district, and its postal code.

Note: (a) including offshore Panjang Island (7.4 km2) with 3,420 inhabitants in 2023. &lt;br&gt;(b) the 2010 population on the new Lebakwangi District is included in the figures for the districts from which it was cut out.

<text>Carl Peters (27 September 1856 – 10 September 1918) was a German explorer and colonial administrator. He was a major promoter of the establishment of the German colony of East Africa (part of the modern republic Tanzania) and one of the founders of the German East Africa Company. He was a controversial figure in Germany for his views and his brutal treatment of native Africans, which ultimately led to his dismissal from government service in 1897.

==Early life==
Peters was born on 27 September 1856 at Neuhaus an der Elbe in the Kingdom of Hanover, the son of a Lutheran clergyman. Peters studied history and philosophy at the universities of Göttingen and Tübingen, and at the Humboldt University of Berlin as a student of Heinrich von Treitschke. In 1879, he was awarded a gold medal by the Frederick William University for his dissertation concerning the 1177 Treaty of Venice and habilitated with a treatise concerning Arthur Schopenhauer.

== Career ==
===German East Africa Company===
After his studies, instead of becoming a teacher, Peters moved to London, where he stayed with his recently widowed maternal uncle, Carl Engel, on Addison Road. Engel was a distinguished composer and musical essayist, the brother-in-law of the ophthalmologist Sir William Bowman, and lived the life of a gentleman. During his time in London, Peters was offered the opportunity of becoming a British subject, which he rejected due to his German nationalist sympathies. Having studied the principles of European colonialism during his foreign sojourn, when Peters returned to Berlin he initiated the Society for German Colonization &quot;(Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation)&quot;, a pressure group for the acquisition of colonies by Germany.

In the autumn of 1884, he proceeded with two companions to East Africa, and concluded in the name of his society treaties with the chiefs of Usagara and neighbouring areas. The treaties were written in German and had little legal value. Even Karl Jühlke, who was a member of Peters&#x27; expedition, conceded that &quot;it is true that the natives were probably not clear as to the significance of the treaties.&quot; Returning to Europe early in 1885, Peters formed the German East Africa Company, as successor to the Society for German Colonization.

The German government of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, fearing the effect on relations with the British, was originally opposed to these plans, and had refused any funding when Peters began. Bismarck refused a second time when Peters returned to Germany during the last days of the Berlin Conference of 1884, demanding an imperial charter. Peters threatened the Chancellor successfully by threatening to sell his acquisitions to King Leopold II of Belgium who was eager to expand his territory of Congo. As Bismarck&#x27;s National Liberal Party allies in the Reichstag parliament were pro-colonial anyway, he finally agreed and the charter was granted on 27 February 1885. This constituted the necessary beginning for further expansion on the East African mainland in the years ensuing.

Peters had no training or experience in running a business, and the German East Africa Company was soon in financial difficulties. With government intervention it was reorganised and refinanced in March 1887 and Peters had to renounce his control. He was appointed as the company&#x27;s director in Zanzibar, where he served during 1887-88. However he failed to negotiate a treaty with Barghash bin Said, sultan of Zanzibar, for the leasing of the coastal zone, and he was recalled to Germany early in 1888. Later that year the German East Africa Company reached an agreement with Barghash&#x27;s successor, Sultan Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar, who leased his coastal dominions in what was to be Tanganyika to the German East Africa Company.

=== Emin Pasha Relief Expedition ===
In the same year Peters began an expedition from the east coast of Africa, avowedly for the relief of Emin Pasha, actually to extend the area of German influence in Uganda and Equatoria. This expedition was not sanctioned by the German government and was regarded by local British authorities as a filibuster (in the 19th century sense of the word). Peters and his expedition &quot;lived off the land,&quot; seizing foodstuffs from the local population. Several years later the Danish explorer, Peder Scavenius, was travelling in the Tana valley, and reported that&quot;On every side I came on traces of war. In the neighborhood of Obangi I found even villages that had been destroyed by fire, and everywhere skeletons of men, women, and children, those of women and children being especially numerous… It was almost impossible for me to procure the necessary rice for my people, for as soon as we approached the whole populace fled panic-stricken. The natives were terrified at my white face, for the last white man they had seen was Dr. Peters.&quot;Reaching Uganda in early 1890, Peters learnt that Emin Pasha had already been located by the American explorer, Henry Moreton Stanley. Peters concluded a treaty with Kabaka Mwanga II of Buganda in favour of Germany. He had to leave Uganda hastily on the approach of an expedition commanded by Frederick Lugard, the representative of the Imperial British East Africa Company. On reaching Zanzibar he learned that his efforts were useless, as on 1 July 1890 the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty between Germany and the UK had been signed, whereby Uganda was left as an area of British influence and Peters&#x27;s agreement with Mwanga became null and void. Meanwhile, the power of his company had ended when the coastal population rebelled in the Abushiri Revolt against the implementation of the lease agreement between the Sultan and the Germans. The German government had to intervene by sending troops commanded by Hermann Wissmann, who ended the insurrection. The German government took over the administration of the territory as a crown colony.

Nevertheless, on his return to Germany Peters was received with great honours, and in 1891 published an account of his expedition entitled &quot;Die deutsche Emin Pasha Expedition&quot;, which was translated into English. He also endorsed the foundation of the &quot;Alldeutscher Verband&quot; in protest against the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty.

===Reichskommissar===
On 18 March 1891, he went out again to East Africa as &quot;Reichskommissar for the Kilimanjaro Region&quot; in Moshi, however subordinate to governor Freiherr von Soden. Peters soon moved the German station from Moshi to Marangu, and he undertook a punitive mission against the Rombo in September 1891. In October 1891 Mabruk, one of Peters&#x27; African servants, broke into the station house at Marangu one night and possibly had sexual relations with one of the African women who were kept as sex-slaves by the Germans. Peters was furious and had the man hanged as punishment. In January 1892 one of those African women, Jagodjo, was also hanged, because Peters suspected her of having been a spy. It was Anglican missionaries who brought this matter to the attention of Governor von Soden, who initiated an inconclusive investigation.

Soden recalled Peters to the coast and gave him the task of working on a commission with the British to delineate the boundary between German East Africa and the British colony which would later become Kenya. Shortly after Peters&#x27; departure from Kilimanjaro the German forces there suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of chief Meli of Moshi. There were those who believed that Peters&#x27; political ineptitude had sown the seeds of this disaster, and reports criticising Peters began to appear in the German press in June 1892.

Peters was recalled to Berlin and employed in the Colonial Section of the Foreign Office from 1893 to 1895, while official accusations were brought against him of excesses in regard to his treatment of the African population. In a session of the Reichstag on 13 March 1896 August Bebel, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, finally made the killings public, citing from an alleged letter written by Peters to Bishop Alfred Tucker. Peters correctly denied the authenticity of the letter but had to admit the executions. After three investigations, in 1897, he was dishonourably deprived of his commission for misuse of official power, losing all his pension benefits.

== Later life and death ==
Peters evaded final sentencing and further criminal prosecution by relocating to London, where he occupied himself with schemes for exploiting parts of Rhodesia and Portuguese East Africa. In the interests of a gold mining company he formed, Peters explored the Fura district and Macombes country on the Zambezi river, where in 1899 he discovered ruins of cities and deserted gold mines of the medieval Kingdom of Mutapa, which he identified as the legendary ancient lands of Ophir. He returned in 1901 and gave an account of his explorations in &quot;Im Goldland des Altertums&quot; (The Eldorado of the Ancients) (1902). In 1905, he again visited the region between the Zambezi and Save rivers.

In 1907–1908 Peters, who had again taken up residence in Germany, brought actions for libel against a Munich journal and the &quot;&quot;, seeking to clear his character in regard to his administration in East Africa. These actions wrought no change in public opinion in Germany and Peters remained on the retired list.

In 1914, Peters was able to return to Germany, after Emperor Wilhelm II by personal decree had bestowed upon him the right to use the title of an Imperial Commissioner again and had given him a pension from his personal budget, while the sentence by the disciplinary court remained in effect.

Peters published an autobiography in February 1918 and died on 10 September.

==Legacy==
Besides the books already mentioned and some smaller treatises, Peters published a philosophical work entitled &quot;Willenswelt und Weltwille&quot; (1883), and a disquisition on early gold production entitled &quot;Das goldene Ophir Salomo&#x27;s&quot; (1895), translated into English in 1899.

A proponent of Social Darwinism and the &quot;Völkisch&quot; philosophy, his attitude towards the indigenous population made him one of the most controversial colonizers even during his lifetime. Critics among Social Democrats, Catholic, and Free-minded politicians considered Peters a national shame. The Austrian Africanist Oscar Baumann referred to him as &quot;half crazy&quot;. One of his nicknames in the German critical press was &quot;Hänge-Peters&quot; (&quot;Hangman-Peters&quot;). He was known by natives as &quot;mkono wa damu&quot;, meaning &quot;the man with blood on his hands&quot;.

However, Peters was feted as a national hero among colonial-minded people. Peters was celebrated as a national hero in Nazi Germany, and was officially rehabilitated by personal decree of Adolf Hitler in 1936. During World War II, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; fleet tender &quot;Carl Peters&quot; was named after him. He was also the subject of a 1941 propaganda film, &quot;Carl Peters&quot;, by Herbert Selpin, starring Hans Albers as Peters.

A number of towns in Germany had streets named after Peters, but many were later renamed following debate concerning his legacy. For example, &quot;Petersallee&quot; in the Afrikanisches Viertel in Berlin was originally named after Carl Peters, but was rededicated in 1986 to Hans Peters, a member of the anti-Nazi resistance. After decades of demands for renaming the Petersallee in Berlin, spearheaded by African and BPoC activists, the street was renamed on 23 August 2024. One part became Maji-Maji-Allee, in remembrance of the Maji-Maji War, the other was baptised Anna-Mungunda-Street, in honour of Anna Mungunda, a Namibian hero of the Anti-Apartheid Struggle.

<doc id="585399" wikidata="Q57430" url="?curid=585399" title="Carl Friedrich Goerdeler">
<text>Carl Friedrich Goerdeler (; 31 July 1884 – 2 February 1945) was a German conservative politician, monarchist, executive, economist, civil servant and opponent of the Nazi regime. He opposed anti-Jewish policies while he held office and was opposed to the Holocaust.

Had the 20 July plot to overthrow Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship in 1944 succeeded, Goerdeler would have served as the Chancellor of the new government. After his arrest, he gave the names of numerous co-conspirators to the Gestapo, causing the arrests and executions of hundreds. Goerdeler was executed by hanging on 2 February 1945.

==Early life and career==
Goerdeler was born into a family of Prussian civil servants in Schneidemühl in the Prussian Province of Posen of the German Empire (now Piła in present-day Poland). Goerdeler&#x27;s parents supported the Free Conservative Party, and after 1899 Goerdeler&#x27;s father served in the Prussian Landtag as a member of that party. Goerdeler&#x27;s biographer and friend Gerhard Ritter described his upbringing as one of a large, loving middle-class family that was cultured, devoutly Lutheran, nationalist and conservative. As a young man, the deeply religious Goerdeler chose as his motto to live by &quot;omnia restaurare in Christo&quot; (to restore everything in Christ). From 1902 to 1905 Goerdeler studied economics and law at the University of Tübingen. From 1911 he worked as a civil servant for the municipal government of Solingen in the Prussian Rhine Province. The same year, Goerdeler married Anneliese Ulrich, by whom he would have five children.Goerdeler&#x27;s own career had been both impressive and idiosyncratic. He came of conservative Prussian stock with a strong sense of duty and service to the State; his father had been a district judge. His upbringing had been happy, but sternly intellectual and moral; his legal training had pointed to a career in local administration and economics...He was a born organiser, an able, voluble speaker and writer, tough and highly individual; in politics, he became a right-wing liberal. Although at heart a very humane man, Goerderler&#x27;s frigid, spartan belief in hard work and his austere, puritanical morality—he would not tolerate a divorced man or woman in his house—lacked warmth and comradeship. He was, in fact, an autocrat by nature and his commanding personality, combined with his utter belief in the rightness of his point of view, enabled him to persuade weak or uncertain men over-easily to accept his own particular point of view while he was with them 


During the First World War, Goerdeler served as a junior officer on the Eastern Front, rising to the rank of captain. From February 1918 he worked as part of the German military government in Minsk. After the war ended, Goerdeler served on the headquarters of the XVII Army Corps based in Danzig (now Gdańsk in Poland). In June 1919, Goerdeler submitted a memorandum to his superior, General Otto von Below, calling for the destruction of Poland as the only way to prevent territorial losses on Germany&#x27;s eastern borders.

After his discharge from the German Army, Goerdeler joined the ultraconservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). Like most other Germans, Goerdeler strongly opposed the Versailles Treaty of 1919, which forced Germany to cede territories to the restored Polish state. In 1919, before the exact boundaries of the Polish-German border were determined, he suggested restoring West Prussia to Germany. Despite his strong hostile feelings towards Poland, Goerdeler played a key role during the 1920 Polish–Soviet War in breaking a strike by Danzig dockers, who wished to shut down Poland&#x27;s economy by closing its principal port. He thought that Poland was a less undesirable neighbour than Bolshevik Russia.

In 1922, Goerdeler was elected as mayor (&quot;Bürgermeister&quot;) of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) in East Prussia and later, on 22 May 1930, as mayor of Leipzig. During the Weimar Republic era (1918-1933), Goerdeler was widely regarded as a hard-working and outstanding municipal politician.

On 8 December 1931, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning, a personal friend, appointed Goerdeler as &quot;Reich&quot; Price Commissioner and entrusted him with the task of overseeing his deflationary policies. The sternness with which Goerdeler administered his task as Price Commissioner made him a well-known figure in Germany. Later he resigned from the DNVP because its leader, Alfred Hugenberg, was a committed foe of the Brüning government.

In the early 1930s, Goerdeler became a leading advocate of the viewpoint that the Weimar Republic had failed, as shown by the Great Depression, and that a conservative revolution was needed to replace democracy.

After the downfall of the Brüning government in 1932, Goerdeler was considered a potential Chancellor. General Kurt von Schleicher sounded him out for the post but eventually Franz von Papen was chosen instead.

After the fall of Brüning&#x27;s government on 30 May 1932, Brüning recommended Goerdeler to President Paul von Hindenburg as his successor. Hindenburg rejected Goerdeler because of his former membership of the DNVP. (From 1928, under the leadership of Alfred Hugenberg, the DNVP had waged a vituperative campaign against Hindenburg and had even labelled him as one of the &quot;November Criminals&quot; who had allegedly &quot;stabbed Germany in the back&quot; in 1918. As a result, by 1932, no current or even former member of the DNVP was acceptable to Hindenburg as chancellor.)

The fall of Brüning led to Goerdeler&#x27;s resignation as Price Commissioner. Later in 1932, Goerdeler refused an offer to serve in Papen&#x27;s cabinet.

===Mayor in the Third Reich===
As late as 1935, Goerdeler considered Adolf Hitler an &quot;enlightened dictator&quot;, who, with the proper advice, would be a force for good. Goerdeler later called the period in which he supported the Nazis the only chapter of his life that he found embarrassing. On 1 April 1933, the day of the national boycott declared against all Jewish businesses in the &quot;Reich&quot;, Goerdeler appeared in full uniform of the &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; of Leipzig to order the SA not to enforce the boycott and ordered the Leipzig police to free several Jews taken hostage by the SA. Several times, he attempted to help Leipzig Jewish businessmen threatened with the &quot;Aryanisation&quot; economic policies of the Nazi regime. A few days after the boycott, Goerdeler found himself as mayor of Leipzig enforcing the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which, unlike the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, did not give him cause for complaint.

As part of his efforts to influence the Nazi regime, Goerdeler had sent Hitler long memoranda containing his advice on economic policy, and in the second half of 1935, he wrote up a new draft law on the powers and responsibilities of municipal governments. He served as a member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law. Despite his early sympathy for the regime and considerable pressure from the National Socialists, Goerdeler always refused to join the NSDAP. By the mid-1930s, Goerdeler grew increasingly disillusioned with the Nazis as it became more and more apparent that Hitler had no interest in reading any of Goerdeler&#x27;s memoranda but was instead carrying out economic and financial policies that Goerdeler regarded as highly irresponsible.

In addition, the massive increase in spending by the Leipzig municipal government caused the city&#x27;s debts to be a major source of worry for Goerdeler. By 1934 he clashed with Hitler over his foreign policy, as Germany signed a nonaggression treaty with Poland to which Goerdeler was opposed and demanded annexation of Polish territories. He wrote to Hitler that continued Polish possession of territories in Gdańsk Pomerania and Greater Poland was a &quot;thorn in country&#x27;s economic flesh and honour&quot; and that &quot;the German people must fight for security of their existence&quot;.

In 1933, a &quot;Reich&quot; law forbade doctors who were members of the Communist Party of Germany or were &quot;non-Aryans&quot; from participating in public health insurance, exempting only those who were First World War veterans or children or parents of veterans. A second decree of 1934 banned all physicians from participating in public health insurance who had one or more Jewish grandparents regardless of their religion or if they were married to a &quot;non-Aryan&quot;. However, the laws did not affect those physicians who received their approbation under the Weimar Republic.

On 9 April 1935, the Deputy Mayor of Leipzig, the National Socialist Rudolf Haake, overstepping existing laws, banned all Jewish doctors from participating in public health insurance and advised all municipal employees not to consult Jewish doctors. In response, the &quot;Landesverband Mitteldeutschland des Centralvereins deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens e. V&quot; (Middle German Regional Association of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith) complained to Goerdeler and asked him to enforce the existing anti-Semitic laws, which allowed at least some Jewish doctors to practice.

On 11 April 1935, Goerdeler ordered the end of Haake&#x27;s boycott and provided a list of &quot;non-Aryan&quot; physicians permitted to operate and those excluded. Critics of Goerdeler, such as the American political scientist Daniel Goldhagen, have considered the exclusion list as evidence of Goerdeler&#x27;s anti-Semitism. By contrast, defenders like the Canadian historian Peter Hoffmann have argued that Goerdeler&#x27;s insistence on enforcing the laws served to protect at least some Jewish physicians.

===Price Commissioner: making economic policy===
In November 1934, Goerdeler was again appointed &quot;Reich&quot; Price Commissioner, and ordered to combat the increasingly unpopular inflation caused by rearmament. Gestapo reports from 1934 record that the German public greeted the news of Goerdeler&#x27;s reappointment as Price Commissioner as a positive development. Despite the great fanfare that greeted Goerdeler&#x27;s appointment, he was given little real power.

In 1934, Goerdeler was vehemently opposed to the idea of devaluing the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; and had supported Hitler and Schacht against the advocates of devaluation. During his second term as Price Commissioner in 1934–35, Goerdeler often came into conflict with the Economics Minister and &quot;Reichsbank&quot; President Hjalmar Schacht over his inflationary policies. In Goerdeler&#x27;s opinion, they posed a grave danger to the German economy, and finally prompted his resignation in 1935 as Price Commissioner. As Price Commissioner, Goerdeler became increasingly troubled by Nazi economic policies and disgusted by rampant corruption within the Nazi Party. In September 1935, as mayor of Leipzig, Goerdeler found himself enforcing the Nuremberg Laws, which he found deeply distasteful.

In October 1935, Goerdeler sent Hitler a memorandum in which he urged that the priorities for the use of German foreign exchange should be shifted from buying raw materials that Germany lacked for rearmament and instead should be used to buy food that Germany lacked such as fats. In his report, Goerdeler wrote that the foremost goal of German economic policy should be &quot;the satisfactory provisioning of the population with fats, even in relation to armaments, as having political priority&quot;. In the same report, Goerdeler argued that the root of German economic problems was rearmament, and he advocated as the solution reducing military spending, increasing German exports and returning to a free-market economy.

Goerdeler warned that to continue the present course of increasing statism in the economy and the current levels of high military spending would result in the total collapse of the economy with an extremely drastic drop in living standards. After Hitler ignored Goerdeler&#x27;s report, Goerdeler asked Hitler to dissolve the Reich Commissariat for Price Surveillance since there was nothing for that office to do. In the spring of 1936, Goerdeler came into increasing conflict with Haake over the question of demolition of a monument to the German-Jewish composer Felix Mendelssohn.

In the summer of 1936, Goerdeler was heavily involved in trying to influence the decisionmaking regarding the great economic crisis, which gripped Germany that year. Despite his earlier differences with Schacht, Goerdeler and Schacht headed the &quot;free-market&quot; faction in the German government and, during the economic crisis of 1936, urged Hitler to reduce military spending, turn away from autarkic and protectionist policies and reduce statism in the economy. Supporting the &quot;free-market&quot; faction were some of Germany&#x27;s leading business executives, most notably Hermann Duecher of AEG, Robert Bosch of Robert Bosch GmbH and Albert Voegeler of Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG. Goerdeler and Schacht were opposed by another faction centred around Hermann Göring calling for the opposite.

Despite his disagreements with Göring over the best economic course to follow, on 6 August 1936, Göring commissioned a report from Goerdeler as a leading economic expert about whether or not Germany should devalue the &quot;Reichsmark&quot;. Goerdeler began his report by rejecting the policies of Schacht&#x27;s New Plan of 1934 as untenable. Making a U-turn from his stance of 1934, Goerdeler now embraced devaluation of the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; as the best solution to the economic crisis. Goerdeler argued that the tolerance of other Western nations, especially the United States for the German state&#x27;s subsidising the dumping of exports was wearing thin and would soon result in harsh new tariffs being applied against German goods.

Goerdeler argued that the only way out of the economic crisis, which gripped the German economy in 1936, was the devaluation of the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; and abandoning all of the restrictions on foreign exchange in Germany. Goerdeler argued that for devaluation of the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; to be successful would require co-ordination with other nations, especially the United States, the United Kingdom and France, which otherwise might be tempted to engage in competitive devaluations of the dollar, the pound and the franc respectively. To secure their co-operation, Goerdeler argued for rapprochement with the Western powers. In his memorandum for Göring, Goerdeler wrote of the &quot;grandiose possibility&quot; that a German reengagement with the world economy and the end of protectionism and autarchism would lead to a new age of economic co-operation among the world&#x27;s largest economies.

To that end, Goerdeler argued in exchange for Anglo-French-American economic co-operation and support, Germany should at least cease its unilateral economic policies and sharply cut military spending. In addition, Goerdeler felt that the price of Western economic support would be a moderation of the Nazi regime&#x27;s policies in regards to the &quot;Jewish question, freemasonry question, question of the rule of law, Church question&quot;. Goerdeler wrote, &quot;I can well imagine that we will have to bring certain issues... into a greater degree of alignment with the imponderable attitudes of other peoples, not in substance, but in the manner of dealing with them&quot;.

The British historian Adam Tooze has argued that Goerdeler was following his own agenda in seeking to moderate the regime&#x27;s domestic policies in his memorandum and that it is highly unlikely that outside powers would have required the concessions on anti-Semitic and other domestic policies that Goerdeler advocated as the price of Western economic support. However, Tooze feels that Goerdeler was correct in arguing that the West would have made cutting military spending a precondition of economic support. Goerdeler argued his policies of economic liberalisation and devaluation would, in the short run, cause 2 million–2.5 million unemployed in Germany but argued that, in the long run, the increase in exports would make the German economy stronger.

In public, Göring called Goerdeler&#x27;s memorandum &quot;completely unusable.&quot; Göring&#x27;s copy of Goerdeler&#x27;s memorandum is covered with handwritten personal comments by Göring on the side such as &quot;What cheek!&quot;, &quot;Nonsense!&quot;, and &quot;Oho!&quot; When Göring forwarded a copy of Goerdeler&#x27;s memorandum to Hitler, his covering letter stated: This may be quite important, my &quot;Führer&quot;, for your memorandum, since it reveals the complete confusion and incomprehension of our bourgeois businessmen, limitation of armaments, defeatism, incomprehension of the foreign policy situation alternate. His [Goerdeler&#x27;s] recommendations are adequate for a mayor, but not for the state leadership.

Goerdeler&#x27;s advice was rejected by Hitler in his &quot;Four-Year Plan Memorandum&quot; of August 1936. Instead, in the autumn of 1936, the Nazi regime launched the Four Year Plan as a way out of the 1936 economic crisis. Hitler himself found Goerdeler&#x27;s report objectionable, and Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Four-Year Plan Memorandum&quot; may have been written in part as a reply to Goerdeler&#x27;s memorandum (Gerhard Ritter favoured this theory whereas Gerhard Weinberg rejects it). 

On 4 September 1936, speaking before the German Cabinet, Göring cited Goerdeler&#x27;s memorandum as an example of flawed economic thinking and announced that Germany would pursue heavy military spending, protectionism and autarky, regardless of the economic consequences.

===Resignation===
In the autumn of 1936, Goerdeler&#x27;s ongoing dispute with Haake over the Mendelssohn statue came to a head. After much argument, Goerdeler agreed to have the statue moved from its location in front of the Gewandhaus concert hall to a lower-profile position. In the autumn of 1936, Goerdeler left for a trip to Finland promoted by the German Chamber of Commerce. Before leaving, Goerdeler met with Adolf Hitler and the propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and received their promise that nothing would happen to the statue during his trip.

During his trip, the statue was demolished on Haake&#x27;s orders. Upon his return, Haake stated that the matter of the statue was &quot;only the outward occasion of the conflict&quot; and declared that &quot;Dr. Goerdeler&#x27;s attitude in the Jewish Question had been revealed particularly clearly in the matter of the Mendelssohn-Bartholdy statue&quot;. Goerdeler tried to have the statue rebuilt. After failing that, he declined to accept his reelection as mayor of Leipzig and resigned from office on 31 March 1937.

==Opposition to Nazi regime==

===Into opposition===
After his resignation as &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; of Leipzig, Goerdeler was offered the position of heading the finance department at the firm of Krupp AG, then Germany&#x27;s largest corporation. However, Hitler forbade Goerdeler to take up this appointment and ordered Krupp to withdraw the offer. Goerdeler instead became the director of the overseas sales department at the firm of Robert Bosch GmbH.

Shortly after his resignation, Goerdeler became involved in anti-Nazi plots. Bosch, a friend, agreed to turn a blind eye to his anti-Nazi work. As a conservative and self-proclaimed follower of the Bismarckian tradition, Goerdeler was opposed to what he considered the extreme radicalism of the Nazis and was fearful of what the results of Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy might be. From 1936, Goerdeler worked to build an opposition faction out of his circle, comprising mostly civil servants and businessmen.

Despite his anti-Nazi plotting, Goerdeler continued to submit memoranda to Hitler and the other Nazi leaders in the hope that he might somehow convince them to change course. The case of Goerdeler has been used by the historian Hans Mommsen to support his view of &quot;resistance as a process&quot;, with Goerdeler going from an ally of the regime to increasing disillusionment by Nazi economic policies in the mid-1930s and finally becoming committed to the regime&#x27;s overthrow by 1937.

By early 1938, Goerdeler was convinced that &quot;something must be done&quot; about the Nazi regime. Describing Goerdeler during this period, the American journalist William L. Shirer wrote that Goerdeler was &quot;A conservative and a monarchist at heart, a devout Protestant, able, energetic and intelligent, but also indiscreet and headstrong&quot; who &quot;went to work with heart and soul in opposition to Hitler&quot;.

Using the &quot;cover&quot; of his job as chief of overseas sales at Bosch, between 1937 and 1938, Goerdeler often travelled abroad, mostly to France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Balkans, the Middle East and Canada, to warn anyone who would listen about what he considered to be the aggressive and dangerous foreign policy of Nazi Germany. Though opposed to what he considered to be a reckless foreign policy, Goerdeler often demanded in his meetings with his foreign friends for the Great Powers to back the cession of the Sudetenland, the Polish Corridor, the Memelland (modern Klaipėda, Lithuania), and the Free City of Danzig and the return of the former German colonies in Africa, to Germany. At the same time, Goerdeler became a member of General Ludwig Beck&#x27;s private intelligence network.

Goerdeler&#x27;s reports were received not only by Beck but also by General Werner von Fritsch. The German historian observed that Goerdeler, in his contacts abroad, tended to falsely portray himself as leading a movement that was more organised than it really was. and that he presented himself to his foreign contacts as the secret spokesman of a well-organised &quot;German Opposition&quot;.

Besides trying to influence foreign governments, Goerdeler attempted to use his reports to the Army leadership to try to influence the Army into considering an anti-Nazi &quot;putsch&quot;. During one of his visits to London, in June 1937, Goerdeler told Sir Robert Vansittart that he would like to see the Nazi regime replaced by a right-wing military dictatorship that would seek British friendship, and Goerdeler wanted, in exchange, British support for annexing parts of Poland and Czechoslovakia. In October 1937, during a visit to the United States, Goerdeler stayed with the British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett at the latter&#x27;s estate in Virginia and informed him of his desire to restore the monarchy in Germany. During the same trip, Goerdeler drafted his &quot;Political Testament&quot;, attacking Nazi economic policies and criticized the regime for its anti-Christian policies, widespread corruption and lawlessness. Goerdeler met several times with Winston Churchill and Vansittart.

===1938: first attempt at a &quot;putsch&quot;===
During the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair and the attendant crisis caused by the court-martial of General Werner von Fritsch, Goerdeler became closely associated with several loose groupings of German rightists in the Civil Service and the military who, for various reasons, were unhappy with aspects of the Third Reich. Goerdeler attempted to use the Fritsch crisis to try to turn the Army leadership against the Nazi regime, but his efforts were in vain.

In April 1938, Goerdeler visited London, where he advised the British government both to resist the Nazi claim to the Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia and to declare that he wanted to see the area transferred to Germany as soon as possible. As Gerhard Weinberg observed, Goerdeler&#x27;s contradictory statements left the British somewhat confused. In the spring of 1938, Goerdeler, in association with Hans von Dohnanyi, Colonel Hans Oster and Johannes Popitz, became involved in planning a &quot;putsch&quot; against the Nazi regime should the regime launch &quot;Fall Grün&quot;, the codename for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. In June 1938, Beck often consulted with Goerdeler over the question of whether or not he should resign as Chief of the General Staff as a way of stopping &quot;Fall Grün&quot;.

Vansittart introduced Goerdeler to one of his spies, the British industrialist A.P. Young, who was a close business partner to several German corporations and so often visited Germany. Because Young did frequent business with Bosch and because of Goerdeler&#x27;s position there, the two could meet often without raising suspicion. In August 1938, Goerdeler started to leak information to London and informed the British that Hitler intended to launch &quot;Fall Grün&quot; in September 1938. In August 1938, Goerdeler met with Young in the village of Rauschen Dune in East Prussia. During his meeting with Young, Goerdeler asked for Young to convey a message to the British government to the effect that London should apply diplomatic and economic pressure on Germany to cease the persecution of the Jews. To have more frequent meetings with his British contacts, Goerdeler stayed in Switzerland in August–October 1938.

Though the British politicians and civil servants who met with Goerdeler were impressed with his honesty and earnestness, it was judged too risky by the Chamberlain government in 1938 to stake all upon the Goerdeler&#x27;s projected &quot;putsch&quot;, especially since success was uncertain at best, and discovery of British backing for an unsuccessful &quot;putsch&quot; was likely to cause the war the Chamberlain government was seeking to avert in 1938.

Moreover, as one British civil servant wrote on August 22, 1938:We have had similar visits from other emissaries of the &quot;Reichsheer&quot;, such as Dr. Goerdeler, but those for whom these emissaries claim to speak have never given us any reasons to suppose that they would be able or willing to take action such as would lead to the overthrow of the regime. The events of June 1934 [the Night of the Long Knives] and February 1938 [the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair] do not lead one to attach much hope to energetic action by the Army against the regime. Ulrich von Hassell wrote in his diary that Goerdeler was &quot;imprudent&quot; but at least &quot;wants to act rather than grumble&quot;, which was a marked difference to the generals who indicated that perhaps they would or perhaps they would not act against the Nazi regime should Czechoslovakia be attacked.

In the tense atmosphere of September 1938, with the crisis in Central Europe looking likely to explode into war at any moment, Goerdeler was waiting anxiously for the &quot;putsch&quot; to overthrow the Nazi regime, and his taking over the reins of the German state as the new Chancellor. During his planning for the coup, Goerdeler was in contact with Chinese intelligence, using General Alexander von Falkenhausen as intermediary. Like most German conservatives, Goerdeler favoured Germany&#x27;s traditional informal alliance with China, and was strongly opposed to the &quot;volte-face&quot; in Germany&#x27;s Far Eastern policies effected in early 1938 by the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, who abandoned the alliance with China for an alignment with Japan. In a September 1938 meeting with Young, the latter reported that &quot;X&quot; (as Goerdeler was code-named by the British) had stated about the domestic situation in Germany: &quot;the working classes are nervous, distrustful of the Leader. Their allegiance is doubtful. In another meeting on September 11, 1938, in Zurich, Young recorded Goerdeler as saying: the feeling among the people against the war is welling up at an alarming rate. His [Goerdeler&#x27;s] recent talks with leading industrialists had satisfied him that the workers&#x27; feelings have been bitterly roused to the point where, if they were in possession of arms, they would physically revolt against the regime On September 29, 1938, Goerdeler informed the British, through one of Vansittart&#x27;s contacts, Colonel Graham Christie, that the mobilization of the Royal Navy was turning German public opinion against the regime. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew Goerdeler well, noted that Goerdeler failed to realize that Hitler was not bluffing with &quot;Fall Grün&quot; and had every intention of attacking Czechoslovakia on October 1, 1938, and that he regarded Munich as a personal set-back.

In 1938, Goerdeler was deeply disappointed with the Munich Agreement, which in his view, though it turned over the Sudetenland to Germany, was undesirable in that it removed what Goerdeler considered to be best chance of a &quot;putsch&quot; against the Nazi regime. After the Munich Agreement, Goerdeler wrote to one of his American friends: ...The German people did not want war; the Army would have done anything to avoid it;...the world had been warned and informed in good time. If the warning had been heeded and acted upon Germany would by now be free of its dictator and turning against Mussolini. Within a few weeks we could have begun to build lasting world peace on the basis of justice, reason and decency. A purified Germany with a government of decent people would have been ready to solve the Spanish problem without delay in company with Britain and France, to remove Mussolini and with the United States to create peace in the Far East. The way would have been open for sound co-operation in economic and social fields, for the creation of peaceful relations between Capital, Labour and the State, for the raising of ethical concepts and for a fresh attempt to raise the general standard of living. In the same letter, Goerdeler wrote &quot;You can hardly conceive the despair that both people and the Army feel about the brutal, insane and terroristic dictator and his henchmen&quot;. Wheeler-Bennett commented that Goerdeler was vastly exaggerating the extent of anti-Nazi feelings, both in the German Army and among the German public. After Munich, Goerdeler told Young that:It is vitally important to realise that Hitler is deeply and definitely convinced that after his unexpected victory at Munich, anything is possible to him...He says that he [Hitler] is now convinced that England is degenerate, weak, timid and never will have the guts to resist any of his plans. No war will ever be needed against either England or France In November 1938, when Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany went on sick leave, the acting heads of the Embassy in Berlin sent a series of reports to the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax intended to effect a change in British policy towards Germany. Goerdeler emerged as one of the Embassy&#x27;s leading informants.

===As agent &quot;X&quot;===
In November 1938, Goerdeler met with Young in Switzerland and asked if the British government could intercede on the behalf of 10,000 Polish Jews the Germans had expelled from Germany, whom the Poles refused to accept. Goerdeler declared that the treatment of the Polish Jews, stranded on the German-Polish border, was &quot;barbaric&quot;. In December 1938-January 1939, Goerdeler had a further series of meetings with Young in Switzerland, where he informed Young that the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom of November 1938 had been ordered by Hitler personally and was not a &quot;spontaneous&quot; demonstration as the Nazis had claimed.

Goerdeler recommended that Young inform London that as soon as &quot;the new persecution of the Jews is started, it is absolutely essential to break diplomatic relations&quot;. Goerdeler also informed Young of his belief that Hitler was seeking world conquest, and that the &quot;Führer&quot; had &quot;decided to destroy the Jews-Christianity-Capitalism&quot;. Speaking to Young about the economic situation in Germany, Goerdeler stated: Economic and financial situation gravely critical. Inner situation desperate. Economic conditions getting worse.

In another meeting with Young, Goerdeler claimed &quot;the working classes are nervous, distrustful of the leader. Their allegiance is doubtful&quot;. Goerdeler maintained to Young: the feeling among the people against war is welling up at an alarming rate. His [Goerdeler&#x27;s] recent talks with leading industrialists had satisfied X that the workers&#x27; feeling have been bitterly roused to the point where, if they were in possession of arms, they would physically revolt against the present regime. Goerdeler&#x27;s reports to Young were later published by the latter in 1974 as &quot;The &quot;X&quot; Documents&quot;.

In December 1938, Goerdeler again visited Britain, where he alienated the British civil servants he met by his extreme German nationalist language and demands for British support for the return of Danzig, the Polish Corridor and the former German colonies in Africa, and for making a huge loan to a post-Nazi Germany. Goerdeler asked Frank Ashton-Gwatkin of the Foreign Office to ensure that Britain gave a post-Nazi government an interest-free loan of £500 million in exchange for which Goerdeler would end protectionism, end the efforts to place the Balkans into the German sphere of influence and support Britain in the Mediterranean against Italy and in the Far East against Japan. In addition, both Goerdeler&#x27;s exaggeration of extent of anti-Nazi feeling in Germany and his inability to organise a &quot;putsch&quot; were increasingly clear to the British. Sir Alexander Cadogan wrote about Goerdeler&#x27;s offer, &quot;We are to deliver the goods and Germany gives I.O.Us&quot;. Chamberlain was more hostile and wrote, &quot;These people must do their own job&quot;.

In the same month, Goerdeler wrote his &quot;World Peace Programme&quot; calling an international conference of all the world&#x27;s leading powers to consider disarmament, a &quot;moral code&quot; for relations between the states and the stabilisation of the various currencies. The end of Goerdeler&#x27;s &quot;World Peace Programme&quot; read &quot;Whoever abstains from co-operating wants war and is a breaker of the peace.&quot;

==German Resistance==
===Prelude to Second World War===
Despite what Goerdeler perceived as a major setback after Munich, he continued with his efforts to bring about the downfall of the Nazi regime. Goerdeler, an unyielding optimist, believed that if only he could convince enough people, he could overthrow the Nazi regime. Goerdeler believed that through sheer force of will and the goodness of his cause that he could bring down the Nazi regime. Goerdeler spent much of the winter of 1938–39 holding discussions with General Beck, the diplomat Ulrich von Hassell and Erwin Planck about how best to overthrow the Nazi regime. At the same time, Hitler grew increasingly annoyed with Goerdeler&#x27;s memoranda urging him to exercise caution. Goerdeler, together with Dr. Schacht, General Beck, Hassell and the economist Rudolf Brinkmann, were described by Hitler as &quot;the overbred intellectual circles&quot; who were trying to block him from fulfilling his mission by their appeals to caution, and but for the fact that he needed their skills &quot;otherwise, perhaps we could someday exterminate them or do something of this kind to them&quot;.

During the winter of 1938–39, Goerdeler sent reports to the British that stated that Hitler was pressuring Italy into attacking France, planning to launch a surprise air offensive against Britain to achieve a &quot;knock-out blow&quot; by razing British cities to the ground sometime in the second half of February 1939, and considering an invasion of Switzerland and the Low Countries before an attack on France and Britain. Unknown to Goerdeler, he was transmitting false information provided by the Abwehr chief Admiral Wilhelm Canaris and General Hans Oster, who was hoping that the reports might lead to a change in British foreign policy. Canaris and Oster achieved their purpose as Goerdeler&#x27;s disinformation resulted in first the &quot;Dutch War Scare&quot;, which gripped the British government in late January 1939 and led to the public declarations by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in February that any German attack upon France, Switzerland and the Low Countries would be automatically considered the &quot;casus belli&quot; for an Anglo-German war and would lead to the British &quot;continental commitment&quot; to defend France with a large ground force.

On 16 March 1939, Goerdeler suggested to Young that Britain call an international conference to discuss &quot;legitimate&quot; German demands for changes in the international order. Goerdeler claimed that Hitler would refuse to attend the conference, which would so discredit him as to bring about his downfall. Young passed on Goerdeler&#x27;s conference idea to Cordell Hull, who was so impressed that he offered to bring about the proposed conference to be chaired by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. That was the origin of Roosevelt&#x27;s famous appeal to Hitler and Mussolini on 15 April 1939 for both leaders to publicly promise not to disturb the peace for the next ten years. In exchange, Roosevelt promised a new economic international order.

In the second half of March 1939, Goerdeler together with Schacht and Hans Bernd Gisevius visited Ouchy, Switzerland, to meet with a senior French &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; intelligence agent representing French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier Goerdeler told the agent that the strain of massive military spending had left the German economy on the verge of collapse; that Hitler was determined to use the Danzig issue as an excuse to invade Poland, which in itself was only a prelude for a German seizure of all of Eastern Europe; that a forceful Anglo-French diplomatic stand could deter Hitler; and that if Hitler were deterred long enough, the economic collapse of Germany would cause the downfall of his regime. In April 1939, during a secret meeting with the British diplomat Sir Gladwyn Jebb, Goerdeler stated that if the British continued with their &quot;containment&quot; policy adopted in March 1939, then they might see the &quot;Hitler adventure... liquidated before the end of June [1939].&quot; There is considerable debate as to the accuracy of that information, with some historians such as Richard Overy arguing that Goerdeler and other German conservatives had exaggerated German economic problems to the British and the French. Overy charged that Goerdeler wanted a very firm Anglo-French stand in favour of Poland in the hope that if confronted with such a situation, the German Army would overthrow Hitler, rather than risk a world war, and so Goerdeler exaggerated the economic problems of the &quot;Reich&quot; to encourage such a stand.

The &quot;X documents&quot; and how to interpret them played a key role in the debate in the late 1980s between Overy and the Marxist Timothy Mason about whether the German attack on Poland was a &quot;flight into war&quot; forced on Hitler by an economic crisis. Other historians have contended that Goerdeler&#x27;s information about German economic problems was correct and have pointed to the fact that only massive Soviet economic support, combined with plundering occupied lands, saved the German economy from collapse during the winter of 1939–40. Even with Soviet economic support (especially oil) and the exploitation of Poland and the &quot;Reich&quot; Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia, the impact of the British blockade caused a 75% decline in value and tonnage of German imports during the Phoney War.

On 6 May 1939, Goerdeler leaked information to the British Foreign Office stating that the German and Soviet governments were secretly beginning a rapprochement, with the aim of dividing Eastern Europe between them. In May 1939, Goerdeler visited London to repeat the same message to the British government. During his London trip, Goerdeler told the British that the state of the German economy was so deplorable that war, even if it occurred, would only accelerate the German economic collapse and that Germany simply lacked the economic staying power for an extended war. During the same visit to London in May 1939, Goerdeler claimed that the German Army leadership was willing to overthrow the regime, that he himself favoured launching a &quot;putsch&quot; immediately, but that &quot;the leaders of the whole movement... still considered it too early&quot;. The German historian Klaus-Jürgen Müller commented that Goerdeler in making these claims was either lying to the British or else was seriously self-deluded. Goerdeler&#x27;s assessment of the German diplomatic-military-economic situation had considerable influence on decision-makers in the British and French governments in 1939, who, based on his reports, believed that a firm Anglo-French diplomatic stand for Poland might bring about the fall of Hitler without a war or, at least, would ensure that the Allies faced war on relatively auspicious economic terms.

Besides trying to influence opinion abroad, Goerdeler urged the German military to overthrow Hitler and frequently found himself frustrated by the unwillingness of the generals to consider a &quot;putsch&quot;. In a memo written at the end of July 1939 during a visit to Turkey, Goerdeler took the view that Hitler was bluffing in his demands against Poland, and if he could be forced to stand down by a firm Anglo-French stand, that would be such a blow as to topple the Nazi regime. Later, as the summer of 1939 went on, Goerdeler changed his views about Hitler&#x27;s intentions towards Poland. In August 1939, Goerdeler contacted General Walter von Brauchitsch and advised him if Germany attacked Poland, the result would not be the limited war that Hitler expected but a world war pitting Germany against Britain and France. Goerdeler advised Brauchitsch that the only way to save Germany from such a war would be a &quot;putsch&quot; to depose Hitler. Brauchitsch was not interested in Goerdeler&#x27;s opinions, and told him that he shared Hitler&#x27;s belief that Germany could destroy Poland without causing a world war in 1939. On August 25, 1939, discovering that the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact had not led as intended to the Anglo-French abandonment of Poland, Hitler ordered the temporary postponement of &quot;Fall Weiss&quot;, which had been due to begin the next day. Goerdeler was convinced that the postponement was a fatal blow to Hitler&#x27;s prestige.

On 26 August, he went to a trip to Sweden that he had been considering cancelling because of the international situation. On 27 August 1939 Goerdeler told the British diplomat Gladwyn Jebb to continue to make a firm diplomatic stand for Poland as the best way of bringing down the Nazi regime. At the same time, Goerdeler&#x27;s insistence on restoring Germany to its 1914 borders and his intense German nationalism left many British diplomats to mistrust Goerdeler as they regarded him as not much different from Hitler. At the beginning of September 1939, Goerdeler returned to Germany a dejected man. Goerdeler was most disappointed and unpleasantly surprised when Germany attacked Poland on 1 September, the Anglo-French declarations of war on 3 September and then the German Army doing nothing to overthrow Hitler. That marked the beginning of a recurring pattern where Goerdeler would invest great hopes in his beloved German Army rising up against Hitler, only to discover repeatedly that Army officers much preferred to fight for the &quot;Führer&quot; to fighting against him.

===Phoney War, the Zossen &quot;putsch&quot; attempt of November 1939 and attack on the West===
In 1939–40, Goerdeler assembled conservative politicians, diplomats and generals, most notably Ulrich von Hassell, General Ludwig Beck and Johannes Popitz, in opposition to Adolf Hitler. On 11 October 1939 speaking to Hassel of German war crimes in Poland, Goerdeler commented that both General Halder and Admiral Canaris were afflicted with nervous complaints as a result of &quot;our brutal conduct of the war&quot; in Poland. In October 1939, Goerdeler drafted peace terms that a post-Nazi government would seek with Great Britain and France. Under Goerdeler&#x27;s terms, Germany would retain all the areas of Poland that had been part of Germany prior to 1918, Austria and the Sudetenland with independence being restored to Poland and Czechoslovakia with general disarmament, the restoration of global free trade and the ending of protectionism as the other major goals for the new regime. On 3 November 1939, Goerdeler paid another visit to Sweden, where he met Marcus Wallenberg, Gustav Cassell, and Dr. Sven Hedin. Hedin wrote in his diary that &quot;he [Goerdeler] believed in Göring and thought that a speedy peace was the only thing to save Germany, but that peace was unthinkable so long as Hitler remained at the head of affairs&quot;. At the same time, Goerdeler was deeply involved in the planning of an abortive &quot;putsch&quot; intended to be launched on 5 November 1939, and as such was in very high spirits prior to that day. Hassell wrote in his diary that with worry that &quot;He [Goerdeler] often reminds me of Kapp.&quot; (Wolfgang Kapp, the nominal leader of the Kapp Putsch was notorious for his irresponsibility). The proposed &quot;putsch&quot; became stillborn when Field Marshal Walter von Brauchitsch and General Franz Halder, the leaders of the planned &quot;putsch&quot; got cold feet, and dropped their support. Brauchitsch and Halder had decided to overthrow Hitler after the latter had fixed &quot;X-day&quot; for the invasion of France for 12 November 1939; an invasion that both officers believed to be doomed to fail. During a meeting with Hitler on 5 November, Brauchitsch had attempted to talk Hitler into putting off &quot;X-day&quot; by saying that morale in the German Army was worse than what it was in 1918, a statement that enraged Hitler who harshly berated Brauchitsch for incompetence. After that meeting, both Halder and Brauchitsch told Goerdeler that overthrowing Hitler was simply something that they could not do, and he should find other officers if that was what he really wanted to do. Equally important, on 7 November 1939 following heavy snowstorms, Hitler put off &quot;X-Day&quot; until further notice, which removed the reason that had most motivated Brauchitsch and Halder to consider overthrowing Hitler. On 23 November 1939, Goerdeler met with Halder to ask him to re-consider his attitude. Halder gave Goerdeler the following reasons why he wanted nothing to do with any plot to overthrow Hitler:
*That General Erich Ludendorff had launched the &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; in March 1918, which led directly to Germany&#x27;s defeat in November 1918, but most people in Germany still considered Ludendorff one of Germany&#x27;s greatest heroes. By contrast, the men who staged the November Revolution and signed the armistice that took Germany out of a losing war were hated all over the &quot;Reich&quot; as the &quot;November Criminals&quot;. Even if Hitler were to launch an invasion of France that signally failed, most people would still support Hitler, just as the failure of the &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; had failed to hurt Ludendorff&#x27;s reputation as it should have, so the Army could do nothing to overthrow Hitler until the unlikely event that his prestige was badly damaged. Until Hitler was discredited, anyone who acted against him to end the war would be a &quot;new November Criminal&quot;.
*That Hitler was a great leader, and there was nobody to replace him.
*Most of the younger officers in the Army were extreme National Socialists who would not join a &quot;putsch&quot;.
*Hitler deserved &quot;a last chance to deliver the German people from the slavery of English capitalism&quot;.
*Finally, &quot;one does not rebel when face to face with the enemy&quot;.
Despite all of Goerdeler&#x27;s best efforts, Halder would not change his mind.

In January–February 1940, Goerdeler together with Popitz, Beck and Hassell spent most of their time working on the sort of constitutional, economic, social and educational system that a post-Nazi government would have to carry out. The basis of all their planning was the restoration of the monarchy. Goerdeler believed that the main reason why the Army would not overthrow Hitler was the lack of a positive goal to inspire them with the hope of a better tomorrow, and if he and his colleagues could work out plans for a better future, then the Army leaders would change their minds. During their discussions for a post-Hitler future, it was agreed that various Nazi leaders like Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler, provided that they were willing to break with Hitler could have a leading role in a post-Nazi government. The only Nazi leader besides Hitler whom Goerdeler and his circle were adamant could play no role in a post-Nazi government was the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop who Goerdeler personally hated as an obnoxious bully, and whose foreign policy Goerdeler viewed as criminally inept. In early April 1940, Goerdeler met secretly with General Franz Halder, the Chief of the General Staff, and asked him to consider a &quot;putsch&quot; while the Phoney War was still on, while the British and French were still open to a negotiated peace. Halder refused Goerdeler&#x27;s request. Goerdeler told Halder that too many people had already died in the war, and this refusal to remove Hitler at this point would ensure that the blood of millions would be on his hands.

Halder told Goerdeler that his oath to Hitler and his belief in Germany&#x27;s inevitable victory in the war precluded his acting against the Nazi regime. Halder told Goerdeler that &quot;The military situation of Germany, particularly on account of the pact of non-aggression with the Soviet Union is such that a breach of my oath to the &quot;Führer&quot; could not possibly be justified&quot; [Halder was referring to the Hitler oath], that only if Germany was faced with total defeat would he consider breaking his oath, and that Goerdeler was a fool to believe that the Second World War could be ended with a compromise peace. Halder ended his meeting with Goerdeler on 6 April 1940 with the remark: Britain and France had declared war on us, and one had to see it through. A peace of compromise was senseless. Only in the greatest emergency could one take the action desired by Goerdeler In June 1940, much to Goerdeler&#x27;s intense disappointment, following the German victory over France, the German Army lost all interest in anti-Nazi plots.

Not until December 1941, after the first German defeats in the Soviet Union, were Army officers again to show interest in becoming involved in Goerdeler&#x27;s anti-Nazi plots. In June 1941, Goerdeler experienced a brief surge of hope that he learned that Hitler had issued a set of orders to the Army for the upcoming Operation Barbarossa that violated international law and made it clear that he wanted the war against the Soviet Union to be waged in the most inhumane, brutal way possible. Goerdeler argued that the Army would now overthrow Hitler because no self-respecting German officer would wage war in such an inhumane fashion and become a war criminal. The sequel was recorded in Hassell&#x27;s diary on 16 June 1941: &quot;Brauchitsch and Halder have already agreed to Hitler&#x27;s tactics [in the Soviet Union]. Thus the Army must assume the onus of the murders and burnings which up to now have been confined to the SS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A series of conferences with Popitz, Goerdeler, Beck and Oster to consider whether certain orders which Army commanders have received (but which they have not yet issued) might suffice to open the eyes of the military leaders to the nature of the regime for which they are fighting. These orders concern brutal...measures the troops are to take against the Bolsheviks when the Soviet Union is invaded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We came to the conclusion that nothing was to be hoped for now...They [the generals] delude themselves...Hopeless sergeant majors!&quot;

===Leader of the national conservative opposition===
====Plans for the future====
During the winter of 1940–1941, Goerdeler spent much of his time discussing with Popitz, Beck and Hassell which of the Hohenzollerns would occupy the throne of Germany after the overthrow of the Nazis. Goerdeler supported the claim of Prince Oskar of Prussia. The idea of restoring the former Emperor Wilhelm II to his throne was rejected by Goerdeler under the grounds that the personality of the former Kaiser and the way he had behaved during his thirty-year reign made him a completely unsuitable candidate. The Crown Prince Wilhelm was rejected by Goerdeler partly because his well deserved reputation as a womaniser, a heavy drinker and an irresponsible playboy made him offensive to the austere, God-fearing Lutheran Goerdeler and partly because of his outspoken support for the Nazi regime. Popitz by contrast, while agreeing with Goerdeler that the unstable former Kaiser was unsuitable, insisted on dynastic grounds that the Crown Prince Wilhelm be the next emperor, and was to spend much time arguing with Goerdeler over which of the sons of the former emperor was to sit on the throne. They developed a future constitution for Germany and even a list of potential ministers. Popitz favored a return to the pre-1918 authoritarian political system. However, Goerdeler argued with his fellow conspirators in favor of a British-style constitutional monarchy with an emperor who was &quot;not meant to govern, but to watch over the Constitution and to represent the State&quot;.

Goerdeler&#x27;s proposed constitution called for a strong executive, a high degree of decentralisation, a &quot;Reichstag&quot; elected partially by the people on a British-style &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; basis (instead of by party lists) and partially by members of local councils, and a &quot;Reichsrat&quot; composed of representatives nominated by Christian churches, trade unions, universities, and business groups. To assist with the drafting of the future constitution, Goerdeler enlisted the help, through his friend Dietrich Bonhoeffer, of the so-called &quot;Freiburger Kreis&quot; (Freiburg Circle), an anti-Nazi discussion group of professors at Freiburg University founded in 1938 that included , , Walter Eucken, Constantin von Dietze, and Gerhard Ritter. Had the July 20 Plot succeeded, Goerdeler would have served as Chancellor in the new government that would have been formed after Hitler&#x27;s assassination and the overthrow of the Nazi regime. In August 1941, Goerdeler was most disappointed with the Atlantic Charter. He felt that the demands contained in Clause 8, calling for the disarmament of Germany, would make both the task of recruiting the German Army to overthrowing the regime more difficult and were unacceptable since Goerdeler believed in maintaining a strong military&quot;. Starting in 1941, Goerdeler expanded his network of anti-Nazi contacts to include Social Democrats like Wilhelm Leuschner and Hermann Maas.

====Reaction to news of genocide====
In late 1941, under the impact of the news of the deportations of German Jews to be shot in Eastern Europe, Goerdeler submitted a memo to the German government calling for all Jews who had been German citizens or were descended from Jews who had been German citizens before 1871 to be classified as Germans, and those Jews who were descended from Jews who had not lived within the borders of Germany prior to 1871 to be considered citizens of a Jewish state whose creation would occur later. In the memo entitled &quot;Das Ziel&quot; (&quot;The Goal&quot;), Goerdeler wrote that a Jewish state should be created somewhere in South America or Canada to which almost the entire Jewish population of Europe would be deported; only German-Jewish veterans of World War I or those German Jews descended from Jews who were German citizens in 1871 would be allowed to stay. Meanwhile, pending the deportation of the Jews to the Americas, Goerdeler called in &quot;The Goal&quot; for the Nuremberg Laws to stay in force while demanding the repeal of the post-&quot;Kristallnacht&quot; anti-Semitic laws. Some controversy has been attracted by this memo. Goerdeler&#x27;s critics are offended by his suggestion that German Jews whose ancestors had not lived within the borders of the German Empire before July 1, 1871, should not be considered German citizens, but Goerdeler&#x27;s defenders such as the Canadian historian Peter Hoffmann have argued that Goerdeler was trying to present the Nazi regime with an alternative to genocide. The German historian Hans Mommsen wrote that Goerdeler&#x27;s anti-Semitism was typical of the German right in which Jews were widely considered to be part of an alien body living in Germany. Mommsen went on to comment that given Goerdeler&#x27;s background in the fiercely anti-Semitic German National People&#x27;s Party, what is surprising was not his anti-Jewish prejudices, but rather that he was able to make any sort of moral objection to Nazi anti-Semitism. In January 1942, Goerdeler submitted another memo to the German government protesting at the deportation of Leipzig Jews. In April 1942, during another visit to Sweden, Goerdeler contacted the Wallenberg family and asked it to contact Winston Churchill about the peace terms that the British would conclude with Germany once the Nazi regime was overthrown. In May 1942, Goerdeler was much saddened when his son Christian was killed in action while serving on the Eastern Front.

====Recruiting for the resistance====
In November 1942, Goerdeler made a secret and illegal visit to Smolensk using forged papers provided by Colonel Hans Oster to meet Field Marshal Günther von Kluge and Henning von Tresckow to gain their support for overthrowing Hitler. Both Kluge and Tresckow promised to arrest Hitler when he visited the Eastern front. Tresckow in particular was very favourably impressed with Goerdeler, whom he saw as a kindred spirit. Goerdeler returned to Berlin feeling assured about the future, and was most disappointed when he received a message from Kluge via General Beck stating he changed his mind about acting against the Nazi regime, and to count him out of any &quot;putsch&quot;. Kluge&#x27;s change of mind about attempting to overthrow Hitler was related to the &quot;gifts&quot; he had received from Hitler in the fall of 1942. On October 30, 1942, Kluge was the beneficiary of an enormous bribe from Hitler who mailed a letter of good wishes together with a huge cheque totaling 250,000 marks made out to him from the German treasury and a promise that whatever improving his estate might cost could be billed out to the German treasury. Hitler was unaware of Goerdeler&#x27;s plotting, but had heard rumours that Kluge was unhappy with his leadership. After receiving another &quot;gift&quot; of 250,000 marks from Hitler later in November that was intended to buy his loyalty, it had the desired effect with Kluge&#x27;s message to Goerdeler not to involve him in anti-Nazi plots.

The corruption of the German officer corps by the Nazi regime via generous bribes was a source of considerable disgust and exasperation to Goerdeler. One of Goerdeler&#x27;s contacts with the Army, a Captain Hermann Kaiser informed Goerdeler that all of the senior officers were taking huge bribes from Hitler in exchange for their loyalty. By May 1943, Goerdeler was well aware that Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, General Heinz Guderian and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt had accepted 250,000 &quot;Reichsmark&quot; cheques as birthday presents from Hitler that were intended to bribe them into loyalty, and that in addition, Guderian had received an estate in Poland. Since these were all men that Goerdeler had hopes of recruiting, their refusal to join the conspiracy because of their greed for more bribes enraged Goerdeler. Goerdeler wrote with disgust in May 1943 that the senior officers &quot;think only of helping themselves&quot;.

In December 1942, the &quot;Freiburg Circle&quot; who were continuing their work helping Goerdeler develop a constitution submitted the &quot;Great Memorandum&quot; to Goerdeler for the proposed post-Nazi German government, which also included &quot;Proposals for a Solution of the Jewish Question in Germany&quot;. The &quot;Proposals&quot; rejected Nazi racial theories but stated that after the overthrow of the Nazis, German Jews would not have their German citizenship restored but be restricted to living in ghettos and be allowed only minimal contact with German Christians, and he called for continuing the Nazi ban on marriage and sex between Jews and German Christians. The Israeli historian Saul Friedländer used the &quot;Proposals&quot; to argue that Goerdeler was anti-Semitic, and that his differences with the Nazis on the &quot;Jewish Question&quot; were ones of degree, not kind.

After the Battle of Stalingrad, the pace of Goerdeler&#x27;s conspiratorial activities gathered speed. Between November 1942 and November 1943, Goerdeler was in regular contact with his friends, the Wallenberg family of Sweden whom he used as middle-men in his efforts to make contact with the British and American governments. On January 22, 1943, at the home of Peter Yorck von Wartenburg Goerdeler met with the Kreisau Circle during which he argued and debated forcefully about the social and economic policies to be pursued by a post-Nazi government. Only with some difficulty were Ulrich von Hassell and Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg able to patch up a measure of agreement between the Kreisau Circle and Goerdeler. Those present at the meeting of January 22 were Goerdeler, Hassell, General Beck, Johannes Popitz and Jens Jessens for the conservative faction and von der Schulenburg, Yorck von Wartenburg, Eugen Gerstenmaier, Adam von Trott zu Solz and Helmuth James Graf von Moltke for the left-learning Kreisau Circle. In March 1943, Goerdeler wrote a letter addressed to several German Army officers appealing to them to overthrow the Nazis and demanding that just one line divide Germans: &quot;...that between decent and non-decent.&quot; Goerdeler went on to write: &quot;How is it possible that so basically decent a people as the Germans can put up for so long with such an intolerable system? Only because all offences against law and decency are carried out under the protection of secrecy and under the pressures of terror&quot; Goerdeler argued that if only a situation were created &quot;in which, if only for twenty-four hours, it [were] possible for the truth to be spoken again&quot;, then the Nazi regime would collapse like a house of cards.

In May 1943, Goerdeler submitted a memo to the Wallenbergs, which he asked them to pass on to the Anglo-Americans outlining his thoughts on the German–Polish border. In the same memo, Goerdeler called for a &quot;European community&quot; comprising a German-dominated confederation, which in turn was to be sub-divided into an Eastern European confederation consisting of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, a confederation of the Scandinavian states, a South European confederation, and a Balkan confederation. The &quot;European confederation&quot; was to be one economic unit with one military ruled over by a Council consisting of two representatives from every state, who would elect a European President for a four-year term. Helping the Council and the President was to be a Federal Assembly to which each of the various confederations would send five to ten members based on their populations. Finally, the European confederation was to serve as the nucleus of a &quot;World Confederation of Nations&quot; that would banish war everywhere, and promote peace and prosperity.

During the spring of 1943, Goerdeler grew increasingly impatient with the military end of the conspiracy, complaining that those officers involved in the plot were better at finding excuses for inaction than reasons for action, a sentiment he expressed in a 1943 letter to General Friedrich Olbricht

Goerdeler had great faith in his idea that if only he could meet with Hitler and explain to him that his leadership was grossly inadequate on military and economic grounds, then Hitler could be persuaded to resign in his favor, thereby ending Nazi Germany through non-violent means. It took considerable effort on the part of Goerdeler&#x27;s friends to talk him out of this plan. After a visit to western Germany, where Goerdeler was horrified by the damage caused by Anglo–American bombing, Goerdeler, in July 1943 wrote a letter to Field Marshal Günther von Kluge criticising him for his continued support of a regime that was leading the nation into ruin. Kluge refused to answer Goerdeler&#x27;s letter, despite the fact that Goerdeler was all but calling the Field-Marshal a coward for his refusal to join the conspiracy.

====Towards the &quot;putsch&quot; of 20 July: late 1943-early 1944====
In August 1943, Goerdeler and his friend, the &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; of Stuttgart, the disillusioned SA-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Karl Strölin sent a joint memo to the &quot;Reich&quot; Interior Minister, the &quot;Reichsführer&quot; SS Heinrich Himmler complaining about the anti-Semitic and anti-Christian policies of the Nazi regime, asking for the end of the &quot;emergency&quot; laws that had suspended civil rights in Germany since 1933, and called for the end of the NSDAP influence on the judiciary. Predictably enough, the memo drew the attention of the Gestapo, who visited both men at their homes to deliver a &quot;final warning&quot; telling them if they continued with &quot;trouble-making&quot;, they would be sent to a concentration camp. In September 1943, Goerdeler appealed to his friend Jacob Wallenberg to ask that the British suspend bombing attacks against Berlin, Stuttgart and Leipzig until the middle of October because &quot;the oppositional movement has its centres there and the interruption of communications would make the &quot;putsch&quot; more difficult&quot;. In a memo Goerdeler sent to the British and American governments in the autumn of 1943, he called for a negotiated peace between the Allies and Germany once the Nazis were overthrown. In the same memo, Goerdeler called for the &quot;1914 frontier&quot; to serve as the basis of Germany&#x27;s borders both in Western and Eastern Europe, called for Austria and the Sudetenland remaining part of the &quot;Reich&quot;, and for the annexation of the south Tyrol region of Italy. In the discussions within the German Opposition between the &quot;Easterners&quot; who favoured reaching an understanding with the Soviet Union after the overthrow of Hitler and the &quot;Westerners&quot; who favoured reaching an understanding with Britain and the United States, Goerdeler belonged to the &quot;Westerners&quot;, considering Communism to be no different from National Socialism, and regarding the &quot;Easterners&quot; as being dangerously naive about the Soviets.

In the summer of 1943, Goerdeler confidently told Jacob Wallenberg that the &quot;putsch&quot; to depose Hitler would happen for certain &quot;in September&quot;, even through Goerdeler had yet to win over any active-duty senior officers. After five years of trying, the only senior officers Goerdeler had recruited were Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, whom Hitler had forced into retirement in early 1942 and General Ludwig Beck who had resigned in 1938. In September 1943, Goerdeler attended a meeting at the home of Olbricht where together with his host Olbricht, General Beck and von Tresckow he finally won over the vacillating Field Marshal Kluge into joining the conspiracy. However, no sooner than Kluge was finally persuaded to join the plot than he was badly injured in a car accident that removed him from active command. As Goerdeler gloomily noted, Kluge&#x27;s successor, Field Marshal Ernst Busch, was a convinced National Socialist who was clearly not &quot;verschwörungsfähig&quot; (plot-worthy).

In the autumn of 1943, Goerdeler first met Colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg. The two men took an immediate dislike to each other. Goerdeler wrote that Stauffenberg &quot;revealed himself as a cranky, obstinate fellow who wanted to play politics. I had many a row with him, but greatly esteemed him. He wanted to steer a dubious political course with the left-leaning Socialists and Communists, and gave me a bad time with his overwhelming egotism&quot;. Goerdeler, who had been the unofficial leader of the German opposition since 1937, resented the efforts of Stauffenberg, who he regarded as a dangerous &quot;romantic socialist&quot;, to take over the conspiracy. Stauffenberg for his part, saw Goerdeler as the leader of &quot;the revolution of the greybeards&quot;. 

Despite his differences with Stauffenberg, Goerdeler appreciated Stauffenberg for solving a problem that had bedevilled him since 1938. Goerdeler had always assumed that to stage a &quot;putsch&quot; required recruiting a senior military figure who could order large bodies of troops into action against the Nazi regime, and it had been the unwillingness of senior military officers to be recruited like Kluge, who could never quite make up his mind, or Halder, who had severed relations with Goerdeler in 1940 once he became convinced that Hitler would win the war that had prevented him from staging a &quot;putsch&quot;. Stauffenberg solved that problem by devising Operation Valkyrie, a plan that ostensibly was meant to crush a slave labour uprising but really was the cover for a &quot;putsch&quot; that could be activated by officers of less than senior rank. Goerdeler was pleased that at long last, the means for a &quot;putsch&quot;, without the senior officers who were plainly not willing to break with the regime, had been devised by Stauffenberg, but his uneasy relations with Stauffenberg were described by the German historian Hans Mommsen as one of mutual &quot;misunderstandings&quot;.

Unlike the Kreisau Circle, Goerdeler was a strong champion of laissez-faire capitalism, and was very much opposed to what he saw as the socialism of the Kreisau Circle. In Goerdeler&#x27;s vision, the economic system was to serve as the basis of the &quot;democracy of the Ten Commandments.&quot; However, Goerdeler was heavily criticised by other members of the German resistance (for example by some members the Kreisau Circle) for objecting to killing Hitler (Goerdeler wanted to see Hitler tried and had no objection to him being executed after his conviction), for his sympathy for reintroducing monarchy, and for his extremely anticommunist ideology.

In late February 1944, Goerdeler sent Strölin to meet Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to see if he would like to join the anti-Nazi conspiracy and was delighted when Strölin gave him a positive report about Rommel&#x27;s attitude towards the conspiracy. Goerdeler decided that Rommel would be the ideal person to play a leading role in a post-Hitler government and asked Strölin to find out if Rommel would be willing to play that role. As Rommel was fully engaged in preparations to resist the expected Allied landing in France all through the spring of 1944, it proved difficult for Strölin to make contact again. After meeting Goerdeler in March 1944, Strölin described him in a high-strung state, constantly afraid that he could be arrested at any moment, and anxious to recruit Rommel while attempting to juggle Rommel&#x27;s demand that he be Wehrmacht Commander-in-Chief with his prior promise that position would go to Erwin von Witzleben if Hitler were overthrown. Not until May could a meeting be arranged to sort out where Rommel stood in regards to the conspiracy. On May 27, 1944, Goerdeler attended a secret meeting with Strölin, the former Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath and General Hans Speidel (who was representing Rommel) at Speidel&#x27;s flat in Freudenstadt. At the meeting, Speidel speaking on behalf of Rommel made clear that his chief wanted nothing to do with any attempt to assassinate Hitler, but was prepared to serve in a government headed by Goerdeler. Later in 1944, Goerdeler told Kunrath von Hammerstein, &quot;In those days your father stood at the helm of world history&quot;. Goerdeler meant that if General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord had carried out a &quot;putsch&quot; in 1933, the present state of world troubles in 1944 might have been avoided.

===Views on the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;===
A latter-day controversy about Goerdeler concerns his attitude towards anti-Semitism. Some historians such as Christof Dipper and Martin Broszat have argued that Goerdeler agreed with the antisemitic policy of the regime until 1938, though afterwards he did resist the Holocaust and other forms of mass murder. The German historian Christof Dipper in his 1983 essay &quot;Der Deutsche Widerstand und die Juden&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The German Resistance and the Jews&quot;) argued that the majority of the anti-Nazi national-conservatives such as Goerdeler were anti-Semitic. Dipper wrote that for Goerdeler and his social circle &quot;the bureaucratic, pseudo-legal deprivation of the Jews practised until 1938 was still considered acceptable.&quot; Though Dipper noted no one in the &quot;Widerstand&quot; movement supported the Holocaust, he also claimed that the national-conservatives like Goerdeler did not intend to restore civil rights to the Jews after the overthrow of Hitler.

By contrast, the Canadian historian Peter Hoffmann in his 2004 essay &quot;The German Resistance and the Holocaust&quot; has contended that Goerdeler was opposed to anti-Semitism in all forms, and that this opposition played a major role in motivating his efforts to overthrow the Nazi regime. Most recently in his 2011 book &quot;Carl Goerdeler and the Jewish Question, 1933-1942&quot; and in his 2013 book &quot;Carl Goerdeler gegen die Verfolgung der Juden&quot; Hoffmann has defended Goerdeler against the charge that he was an anti-Semite. Hoffmann quotes memoranda for Hitler from the years 1934–1939 in which Goerdeler urged the government to change its &quot;Jewish policy&quot; as a matter of justice and national interests; Goerdeler argued that Germany could enjoy good relations with Britain, France and the United States only if the policies concerning &quot;the Jewish Question, the Free-Masons´ Question, legal security, the Church Question&quot; were changed.

Before the war, Goerdeler had implored the British government to pressure Hitler to alleviate his &quot;Jewish policy&quot;. In 1941, he proposed for the League of Nations to found a Jewish state that would extend Jewish citizenship to all Jews in the world. Since Germans according to the German citizenship law of 1913 lost their German citizenship by acquiring another citizenship, Goerdeler declared that for German Jews there must be four categories of &quot;exceptions&quot; to this rule. Analysis of population, emigration, immigration and naturalization statistics shows that Goerdeler&#x27;s proposal guaranteed German citizenship to at least 94% of German Jews and sustain the legal fiction of &quot;exceptions&quot;. Goerdeler thus intended to protect, if possible, all German Jews against the loss of their German citizenship; the few who did not fall into one of Goerdeler&#x27;s categories of &quot;exceptions&quot; could have applied, under the 1913 German citizenship law, for re-instatement. As a leading civilian anti-Hitler conspiracy leader, Goerdeler worked tirelessly to bring about the pre-condition for his proposals&#x27; implementation: the overthrow of the Nazi government.

The Israeli historian Danny Orbach in his 2010 book &quot;Valkyrie: Hahitnagdut Hagermanit Lehitler&quot; (&quot;Valkyrie: Germans Against Hitler&quot;) defended Goerdeler against the charge that he was an anti-Semite by noting Goerdeler&#x27;s strong support for Zionism and his work with Chaim Weizmann in encouraging German Jews to move to the British Mandate for Palestine. In a recent article, Orbach also argued that Dipper&#x27;s accusations of anti-Semitism are based on a misreading, if not distortion, of Goerdeler&#x27;s memoranda, thus ignoring Goerdeler&#x27;s plan to restore emancipation to the German Jews and securing a national homeland for their Polish brethren. The Israeli historian Tom Segev has dismissed Orbach&#x27;s claims that Goerdeler was a philo-Semitic, stating that Goerdeler was an anti-Semitic who supported Zionism only because he disliked the idea of German Jews living in Germany, and he much preferred if they all move to Palestine. The Israeli historian David Bankier wrote in 2002 that Goerdeler was appalled by the Holocaust and was sincerely against the Nazis, but for him, Jews were not and never could be Germans, and instead were an alien, foreign element who would just have to be relocated from Germany whether they liked it or not. Bankier wrote that Goerdeler felt that the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot; was going too far and would have to be stopped, but &quot;[f]or Goerdeler, the solution of the Jewish question after the war was the establishment of a Jewish state in parts of Canada or South America and granting German citizenship only to a small, elitist minority of Jews willing to assimilate completely.&quot;

==20 July==

In May 1944, Goerdeler revived his idea of 1943 of talking Hitler into resigning as a way of achieving a peaceful end to Nazi Germany. Again, Goerdeler proposed to meet with Hitler, explain to him why his leadership was defective, and hope that Hitler would resign and appoint Goerdeler his successor. Again, it took considerable effort on the part of Goerdeler&#x27;s friends to talk him out of this plan, which they considered to be as bizarre as it was impractical. The British historian Ian Kershaw commented that Goerdeler&#x27;s plans to talk Hitler into resigning reflected a certain lack of realism on his part. In June 1944, Goerdeler finished his final Cabinet list. Had the &quot;putsch&quot; of 20 July 1944 succeeded, the Cabinet that would have taken power included the following:

*President of Germany (Regent-&quot;Reichsverweser&quot;): Colonel General Ludwig Beck
*State Secretary to the Regent: Ulrich Wilhelm Graf Schwerin von Schwanenfeld
*Chancellor: Goerdeler (DNVP)
*State Secretary to the Chancellor: Count Peter Yorck von Wartenburg
*Vice-Chancellor: Wilhelm Leuschner (SPD)
*Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Jakob Kaiser (Christian Trade Union leader)
*Minister of War: General Friedrich Olbricht
*State Secretary to the Minister of War: Colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg
*Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces: Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben
*Commander in Chief of the Army: Colonel General Erich Hoepner
*Minister of the Interior: Julius Leber (SPD)
*Minister of Economics: Dr. Paul Lejeune-Jung (lawyer and economist)
*Minister of Finance: Ewald Loeser (DNVP)
*Minister of Justice: Joseph Wirmer (Zentrum)
*Minister of Education: Eugen Bolz (Zentrum)
*Minister of Agriculture: Andreas Hermes (Zentrum)
*Minister of Reconstruction: Bernhard Letterhaus (Christian Trade Union leader)
*Minister of Information: Theodor Haubach (SPD).

The position of Minister of Foreign Affairs would have gone to either Ulrich von Hassell (former ambassador to Italy) or Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg (former ambassador to the Soviet Union) depending upon whether the Western powers or the Soviet Union signed an armistice with the new German government first. In the radio address Goerdeler planned to deliver once the &quot;putsch&quot; had triumphed was included the statement &quot;The persecution of the Jews, which has been carried out in the most inhuman, deeply shaming and quite irreparable ways, is to cease.&quot;

On 16 July 1944, Goerdeler saw his wife and children for the last time in Leipzig, and then departed for Berlin to prepare for the &quot;putsch&quot; planned for later that month. In the days preceding the &quot;putsch&quot; attempt of 20 July 1944, Goerdeler stayed at the home of General Beck in the Berlin suburb of Lichterfelde. Unlike Beck, Goerdeler was very confident of the success of the planned &quot;putsch&quot;, and in a most optimistic mood. On 17 July 1944, a warrant for Goerdeler&#x27;s arrest was issued, causing him to go into hiding. Goerdeler spent the day of the &quot;putsch&quot; hiding out at the estate of his friend, Baron Palombrini, in an anxious and agitated state, listening obsessively to the radio for news of success. Following the failure of the 20 July &quot;putsch&quot;, the Gestapo searched the room in which Goerdeler had been hiding out in the Anhalter Bahnhof hotel, in which they discovered a vast collection of documents relating to the &quot;putsch&quot;, such as the text of Goerdeler&#x27;s planned radio address to the German people as Chancellor. Much to Goerdeler&#x27;s deep disappointment, it was Army troops led by Major Otto Ernst Remer rather than the SS who crushed the &quot;putsch&quot; of 20 July, marking the final time Goerdeler&#x27;s hopes in the Army were to be dashed.

==Capture and execution==

Goerdeler managed to escape from Berlin, but he was apprehended on 12 August 1944 after being denounced by a book-keeper named in Marienwerder (modern Kwidzyn, Poland) while visiting the grave of his parents. After his arrest, eight members of Goerdeler&#x27;s family were sent to the concentration camps under the &quot;Sippenhaft&quot; law. His brother, Fritz, was also sentenced to death and executed on 1 March 1945. Under Gestapo interrogation, Goerdeler claimed that the Holocaust was the major reason for his seeking to overthrow the Nazi regime. On 9 September 1944, after a trial at the People&#x27;s Court, he was sentenced to death. Goerdeler was not physically tortured by the Gestapo, and freely co-operated with the Gestapo in naming names, which made him the object of a considerable hatred from the other prisoners, who saw him as a &quot;spineless rat.&quot;

Goerdeler&#x27;s friend, the historian Gerhard Ritter, who shared the same prison with him, reported that Goerdeler was never tortured but was instead subjected to &quot;the overheating of cells, painfully tight shackling especially at night, bright light shining on one&#x27;s face while one tried to sleep, completely insufficient food&quot;. One prisoner recalled that Goerdeler was often &quot;groaning aloud from hunger&quot;. Goerdeler&#x27;s hope in confessing all was to overload the Gestapo with information, and thereby buy time to save his life and the others imprisoned; in the process, he caused hundreds involved in the plot to be arrested. During his time in prison, Goerdeler was asked by the SS to assist with writing the constitution of a future SS-ruled Germany. Goerdeler agreed, and often met with Otto Ohlendorf and Dr. Mäding of the SD to provide his advice. Whether Goerdeler was sincere in wishing to help the SS or just trying to buy time to save his life remains unclear. When confronted with the loneliness of his imprisonment and the utter defeat of his cause, Goerdeler, who had always been a highly devout Lutheran, became increasingly preoccupied with spiritual matters. Goerdeler was overwhelmed with despair over what he considered to be the triumph of evil and the destruction of all that he loved. Ritter saw Goerdeler in prison in January 1945 and reported: I was...astonished at his undiminished intellectual power, but at the same time I was shocked by his outward appearance. It was a man grown old who stood before me, shackled hand and foot, in the same light summer clothes as had on when captured, shabby and collarless, face thin and drawn, strangely different. But it was his eyes that shocked me the most. They were once bright grey eyes and had flashed beneath the heavy eyebrows; that had always been the most impressive thing about him. Now there was no light in them; they were like the eyes of a blind man, yet like nothing I had seen before. His intellectual power was as it had always been; his spiritual strength was not. His natural cheerfulness had gone; his look seemed turned inward. What I beheld was a man with the weariness of death in his soul.
While Goerdeler was on death row, he wrote a letter that called the Holocaust the very worst of Nazi crimes. At the same time, Goerdeler remained anti-Semitic. In his &quot;Thoughts of a Man condemned to Death&quot;, written towards the end of 1944 in prison, Goerdeler wrote: We should not attempt to minimize what has been happening, but we should also emphasize the great guilt of the Jews, who had invaded our public life in ways that lacked customary restraint. He was finally executed by hanging on 2 February 1945 at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin with two other men: Johannes Popitz and Alfred Delp. While awaiting his death sentence, Goerdeler wrote a farewell letter, which ended with &quot;I ask the world to accept our martyrdom as penance for the German people.&quot;

After the war, Helene Schwärzel was arrested for denouncing Goerdeler. In 1946, she was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 15 years in prison, which was reduced to 6 years on appeal.

<doc id="585407" wikidata="Q6043290" url="?curid=585407" title="Integrative thinking">
<text>Integrative thinking is a field that was developed by Graham Douglas in 1986. It is defined as the process of integrating intuition, reason, and imagination in a human mind to develop a holistic continuum of strategy, tactics, action, review, and evaluation. This may be achieved by applying the SOARA (Satisfying, Optimum, Achievable Results Ahead) process to any problem. The SOARA Process facilitates finding associations between what may have been regarded as unrelated parts of a problem. 

== Definition used by Roger Martin ==
Integrative thinking is a discipline and methodology for solving complex or wicked problems. The theory was originally created by Roger Martin, Dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, and collaboratively developed with his colleague Mihnea C. Moldoveanu, Director of the Desautels Centre for Integrative Thinking.

The Rotman School of Management defines integrative thinking as: 
&quot;...the ability to constructively face the tensions of opposing models, and instead of choosing one at the expense of the other, generating a creative resolution of the tension in the form of a new model that contains elements of the individual models, but is superior to each.&quot;
The website continues:
&quot;Integrative thinkers build models rather than choose between them. Their models include consideration of numerous variables — customers, employees, competitors, capabilities, cost structures, industry evolution, and regulatory environment — not just a subset of the above. Their models capture the complicated, multi-faceted, and multidirectional causal relationships between the key variables in any problem. Integrative thinkers consider the problem as a whole, rather than breaking it down and farming out the parts. Finally, they creatively resolve tensions without making costly trade-offs, turning challenges into opportunities.&quot; 

==Background==

To develop the theory of integrative thinking, Martin interviewed more than 50 successful leaders, from the fields of business (Jack Welch, AG Lafley, Nandan Nilekani), the arts (Atom Egoyan, Piers Handling) and the not-for-profit world (Victoria Hale). He spoke with these leaders, some for more than 8 hours, about the decisions that they had made over their careers and about how they thought through those decisions. What he found was that some of them had a distinct common characteristic - &quot;the predisposition and capacity to hold two diametrically opposing ideas in their heads. And then, without panicking or simply settling for one alternative or the other, they&#x27;re able to produce a synthesis that is superior to either opposing idea.&quot;

==Theory==

Integrative thinkers differ from conventional thinkers in many dimensions.
They tend to consider most variables of a problem to be salient. Rather than seeking to simplify a problem as much as possible, they are inclined to seek out alternative views and contradictory data. 
They are willing to embrace a more complex understanding of how those salient features interconnect and influence one another, a more complex understanding of causality. Rather than limiting the possible causal relationships to simple, linear, one-way dynamics, they entertain the possibility that the causal forces may be multi-directional (i.e. circular) and complex. 
Integrative thinkers approach problem architecture differently. Rather than try to deal with elements in piece parts or sequentially, they strive at all times to keep the whole of the problem in mind while working on the individual parts.
When faced with two opposing options that seem to force a trade-off, integrative thinkers strive for a creative resolution of the tension rather than simply accepting the choice in front of them.

<doc id="585409" wikidata="Q236905" url="?curid=585409" title="Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire">
<text>Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire (born Elizabeth Howard; – 3 April 1538) was an English noblewoman, noted for being the mother of Anne Boleyn and as such the maternal grandmother of Elizabeth I of England. The eldest daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk and his first wife Elizabeth Tilney, she married Thomas Boleyn sometime in the later 15th century. Elizabeth became Viscountess Rochford in 1525 when her husband was elevated to the peerage, subsequently becoming Countess of Ormond in 1527 and Countess of Wiltshire in 1529.

==Family and early life==
Elizabeth was born around 1480 into the wealthy and influential Howard family, as the elder of the two daughters of Sir Thomas Howard, later 2nd Duke of Norfolk, and his first wife Elizabeth Tilney. Her paternal grandfather, Sir John Howard, was created Duke of Norfolk in 1483 by King Richard III.

Her family managed to survive the fall of their patron, King Richard III, who was killed at Bosworth in 1485 and supplanted by the victor, King Henry VII, when she was about five years old. Elizabeth became a part of the royal court as a young girl.

==Marriage and lady-in-waiting for the royal court==
It was while she was at court, that she wed Thomas Boleyn, an ambitious young courtier, sometime before 1500, probably in 1498. According to Thomas, his wife was pregnant many times in the next few years but only three children lived to adulthood. The three children were: 

*Mary Boleyn, mistress of Henry VIII of England (1499 – 19 July 1543).
*George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford (1504 – 17 May 1536).
*Anne Boleyn, Queen consort of Henry VIII of England ( 1507 – 19 May 1536)

The other two boys were Thomas born 1496 and Henry &#x27;Hal&#x27; born 1500. Both died of the sweating sickness plague during the outbreak in 1506. 

Throughout this time, Elizabeth was a lady-in-waiting at the royal court; first to Elizabeth of York, and then to Catherine of Aragon. Based on later gossip, Elizabeth Boleyn must have been a highly attractive woman. Rumours circulated when Henry was involved with Anne Boleyn that Elizabeth had once been his mistress, with the suggestion even being made that Anne Boleyn might be the daughter of Henry VIII. However, despite recent attempts by one or two historians to rehabilitate this myth, it was denied by Henry and never mentioned in the dispensation he sought in order to make his union with Anne lawful. Most historians believe it is likely that this rumour began by confusing Elizabeth with Henry&#x27;s more famous mistress Elizabeth Blount, or from the growing unpopularity of the Boleyn family after 1527.

==1519–1536==

In 1519, Elizabeth&#x27;s daughters, Anne and Mary, were living in the French royal court as Ladies-in-waiting to the French Queen consort Claude. According to the papal nuncio in France fifteen years later, the French King Francis I had referred to Mary as &quot;my English mare&quot;, and later in his life described her as &quot;a great whore, the most infamous of all&quot;.

In the words of historian M.L. Bruce, both Thomas and Elizabeth &quot;developed feelings of dislike&quot; for their daughter Mary. In later years, Mary&#x27;s romantic involvements would only further strain this relationship. Around 1520, the Boleyns managed to arrange Mary&#x27;s marriage to William Carey, a respected and popular man at court. It was sometime after the wedding that Mary became mistress to Henry VIII (the exact dates as to when the affair started and ended are unknown), although she never held the title of &quot;official royal mistress,&quot; as the post did not exist in England. It has long been rumoured that one or both of Mary Boleyn&#x27;s children were fathered by Henry and not Carey. Some historians, such as Alison Weir, now question whether Henry Carey was fathered by the King. Few of Henry&#x27;s mistresses were ever publicly honoured, except Elizabeth Blount, who was mentioned in Parliament and whose son, Henry Fitzroy, was created Duke of Richmond and Somerset in an elaborate public ceremony in 1525. Henry&#x27;s relationship with Mary was so discreet that within ten years, some observers were wondering if it had ever taken place.
In contrast to Mary, Elizabeth&#x27;s other daughter, Anne, is thought to have had a close relationship with her mother. Elizabeth had been in charge of her children&#x27;s early education, including Anne&#x27;s, and she had taught her to play on various musical instruments, to sing and to dance, as well as embroidery, poetry, good manners, arithmetic, reading, writing and some French. In 1525, Henry VIII fell in love with Anne, and Elizabeth became her protective chaperone. She accompanied Anne to Court, since Anne was attempting to avoid a sexual relationship with the King. Elizabeth travelled with Anne to view York Place after the fall of the Boleyn family&#x27;s great political opponent, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey – an intrigue which had given Anne her first real taste of political power. She was crowned queen four years later.

Elizabeth remained in her daughter&#x27;s household throughout her time as queen consort. Tradition has it that Anne&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth I, was named after her maternal grandmother. However, it is more likely that she was named after Henry&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth of York, although the possibility that she was named after both grandmothers cannot be ruled out.

Elizabeth Boleyn sided with the rest of the family when her eldest daughter, Mary, was banished in 1535 for eloping with a commoner, William Stafford. Mary had initially expected her sister&#x27;s support (Anne had been Mary&#x27;s only confidante within the Boleyn family since 1529), but Anne was furious at the breach of etiquette and refused to receive her.

Only a year later, the family was overtaken by a greater scandal. Elizabeth&#x27;s younger daughter, Anne, and her only living son, George, were executed on charges of treason, adultery, and incest. Anne&#x27;s two chief biographers, Eric Ives and Retha Warnicke, both concluded that these charges were fabricated. They also agree that the King wanted to marry Jane Seymour. Beyond this obvious fact, the sequence of events is unclear and historians are divided about whether the key motivation for Anne&#x27;s downfall was her husband&#x27;s hatred of her or her political ambitions. Despite the claims of several recent novels, academic historians agree that Anne was innocent and faithful to her husband. Nonetheless, the judges obeyed the King, condemning Anne, George Boleyn and four others to death. Elizabeth&#x27;s husband Thomas Boleyn and brother Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk provided no help to the condemned. The accused men were beheaded by the axe on 17 May 1536 and Anne was executed by a French swordsman two days later.

==Later life and death==
Following the annihilation of the family&#x27;s ambitions, Elizabeth retired to the countryside. She died only two years after her two younger children. Her husband died the following year. Elizabeth is buried in the Howard family chapel at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lambeth. The church, decommissioned in 1972, is now the Garden Museum.

<text>William Scott Gorham (born March 17, 1951) is an American guitarist and songwriter who is one of the &quot;twin lead guitarists&quot; for the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy. Although not a founding member of Thin Lizzy, he served a continuous membership after passing an audition in 1974, joining the band at a time when the band&#x27;s future was in doubt after the departures of original guitarist Eric Bell and his brief replacement Gary Moore. Gorham remained with Thin Lizzy until the band&#x27;s breakup in 1983. He and guitarist Brian Robertson, both hired at the same time, marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s most critically successful period, and together developed Thin Lizzy&#x27;s twin lead guitar style while contributing dual backing vocals as well. Gorham is the band member with the longest membership after founders Brian Downey (drummer) and frontman and bass guitarist, Phil Lynott.

Since 1996, Gorham has continued to perform with Thin Lizzy on guitar and backing vocals, having assembled various lineups after the death of band leader Lynott in 1986. In 2012, Gorham co-founded the Thin Lizzy spin-off band Black Star Riders to showcase new material. He left Black Star Riders in 2021 in order to concentrate on Thin Lizzy.

==Career==
===Early years===
Scott Gorham was born in Glendale, California and began his musical career at 13, learning to play the bass guitar, and joining several local teenage bands including The Jesters, Mudd and The Ilford Subway, the latter recording a single, &quot;The 3rd Prophecy&quot; in October 1967. He switched instruments when a close friend of his, a guitarist in his then-current band, 18-year-old Steve Schrage, died in a motorcycle crash in Glendale in 1968. Gorham&#x27;s friend (and bandmate in a number of bands) Bob Siebenberg later recalled, &quot;That incident devastated Scott. He decided the very day that he heard about the accident to take this kid&#x27;s place, to try to get to where this kid would have eventually gotten to. Scott stunned everybody by dropping the bass, which he was very proficient at, and switching to guitar.&quot; Gorham subsequently joined Redeye in 1969 with Siebenberg, and the two joined Benbecula in 1970 before Siebenberg moved to England in 1971.

In 1973 Siebenberg, by then also Gorham&#x27;s brother-in-law and drummer with Supertramp, convinced Gorham to join him in England, with hope of playing in the same outfit. Gorham was unable to find work with his friend, so he started playing with a number of bands in pubs around London, before starting his own band, Fast Buck. In 1974 a musician acquaintance, Ruan O&#x27;Lochlainn, suggested he attend auditions being held by Phil Lynott, Thin Lizzy&#x27;s primary songwriter, and one of the founders of the band. Thin Lizzy were at the time in a state of flux and reorganization, and while the drummer and bassist remained, two new guitarists were wanted. Brian Robertson, at age seventeen, had already been chosen before Gorham auditioned and joined. The two guitarists shared lead guitar roles, and harmonized with one another, as well as alternately playing rhythm and lead, which led to Thin Lizzy having what was considered a unique sound.

===Thin Lizzy===

Upon joining Thin Lizzy, Gorham took on a songwriting role as well as that of a guitarist. &quot;She Knows&quot;, the opening track of his first album with the band, &quot;Nightlife&quot;, began a long songwriting partnership with Lynott. They co-wrote two songs for Gorham&#x27;s next album with the band, &quot;Fighting&quot;, and Gorham contributed one of his own, &quot;Ballad of a Hard Man&quot;. This was to be the only Thin Lizzy song that was credited solely to Gorham. He also co-wrote &quot;Warriors&quot; and &quot;Emerald&quot; on &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, Lizzy&#x27;s breakthrough album. Gorham&#x27;s role in the band remained consistent until the recording of 1977&#x27;s &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; album, for which Brian Robertson was largely absent. Gorham played all the lead guitar parts for the majority of the songs, including the hit single &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight (It&#x27;s Caught Me in Its Spotlight)&quot;, though he convinced Lynott to bring back Robertson and have him record the solos for the songs &quot;Killer Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;Opium Trail&quot;.

When Gary Moore returned to the band, replacing Robertson in 1979 for the album &quot;Black Rose: A Rock Legend&quot;, Gorham took the new arrival as an impetus to improve his own playing, as he did with all his subsequent guitar partners in the band. At the same time however, drug use became more prevalent within the band, and Gorham and Lynott both became addicted to heroin. Gorham was unable to rid himself of the habit until 1985, after the band had split up. 1980 introduced another co-lead guitarist in Snowy White, culminating in the album &quot;Chinatown&quot; for which Gorham co-wrote two songs. His songwriting contributions increased on the band&#x27;s next effort, as he was credited with co-writing almost half the songs on the 1981 album &quot;Renegade&quot;. Thin Lizzy split up in 1983 after finishing a tour in support of &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;.

===Phenomena II and 21 Guns===

After Thin Lizzy broke up, Gorham joined Phenomena II, where he met Leif Johansen (ex-A-ha and Far Corporation) with whom he formed 21 Guns, releasing three albums. He has also played with Asia, the Rollins Band, and Supertramp. Gorham&#x27;s sister Vicki married Supertramp&#x27;s drummer Bob Siebenberg.

In 1997, he played guest guitars on the track &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; from Psycho Motel&#x27;s album, Welcome to the World.

===Reformation of Thin Lizzy===
Gorham reformed Thin Lizzy in 1996 with former band members, playing various tours in tribute to founding singer, songwriter, and bassist Phil Lynott, who died in 1986. The tour was named the 20/20 tour – 20 dates for 20 years. After John Sykes&#x27; departure in 2009, Brian Downey, Darren Wharton, and Marco Mendoza rejoined the band. New to the lineup were Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell and former The Almighty vocalist Ricky Warwick. After months of pre-production and two weeks of rehearsals in Los Angeles in November 2010, this version of Thin Lizzy started a world tour in January 2011. Touring continued throughout the year and into 2012, with Campbell eventually being replaced permanently by Damon Johnson.

To coincide with the fortieth anniversary of the release of the Thin Lizzy album &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, there was a selection of special Thin Lizzy shows in 2016–17. The band consisted of Gorham, Ricky Warwick, Damon Johnson, Darren Wharton, Scott Travis and Tom Hamilton.

===Black Star Riders===

After Johnson joined the band, Gorham stated that the band members were considering recording new material, which would be the first new Thin Lizzy studio recordings since 1983. In December 2012, he co-founded the Thin Lizzy spin-off band Black Star Riders as a vehicle for the new material, rather than release it under the Thin Lizzy name. Black Star Riders&#x27; first album &quot;All Hell Breaks Loose&quot; was released in May 2013.
In June 2013, he won the &quot;Riff Lord Award&quot; at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards for his work on the album.

A second Black Star Riders album, &quot;The Killer Instinct&quot;, was released in 2015, followed by touring throughout the UK and Europe during the remainder of the year. Gorham concentrated on a small number of Thin Lizzy festival appearances during 2016, and also began work on the third Black Star Riders album. &quot;Heavy Fire&quot; was released in February 2017, and Gorham confirmed his desire to create new music rather than simply continue to play material from his past, stating, &quot;I think it&#x27;s important if you are a musician, or at least a serious one, that you want to start breaking new ground and not doing the same thing over and over. It&#x27;s important to keep dipping into that songwriting well.&quot;

In September 2021, Gorham announced his departure from Black Star Riders in order to focus on Thin Lizzy.

He rejoined the band in 2023 for the 10 year anniversary tour.

==Guitar and equipment==
When he joined Thin Lizzy, Gorham was playing a Japanese Les Paul copy, which was quickly deemed not up to standard. He is often associated with a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe guitar with mini humbuckers. This guitar was purchased at the same time as his bandmate Brian Robertson&#x27;s Deluxe guitar. The two guitars could be distinguished by the fact that Gorham&#x27;s guitar had a redder finish and lacked a pick-guard. In 1978 he began playing a Les Paul Standard, which became his main guitar until Thin Lizzy broke up in 1983. He can be seen using a Schecter with a Lynott style mirror scratchplate on later videos. Nowadays, Gorham uses only Gibson Axcess Guitars which are lighter and thinner in body width than regular Les Paul guitars, with 100-watt 1970&#x27;s modded Marshall Amplifiers. Even before Thin Lizzy split up, Gorham started using Fender Stratocasters, but reverted to his Gibson Les Paul in 2006. For the Thin Lizzy 2011 tour of the UK, Gorham said that he would be returning to usage of a Gibson Les Paul, this time using a Les Paul Axcess as his main tour guitar. In an interview with &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine he said that he had made contact with Gibson Custom Shop and had used it during rehearsals. The Axcess is different from normal Les Pauls in the fact that it makes use of a Floyd Rose tremolo and also has a thinner body among other features. Gorham&#x27;s Axcess has a thinner neck than the normal models as well as a 500T pickup in the bridge position.

From 2007, Gorham was an endorsee of the German amp company, ENGL. His setup was either two or four E650 Ritchie Blackmore Signature heads, his modified Marshall, and four standard ENGL cabinets. In an interview for the August 2010 edition of &quot;Guitarist magazine&quot;, Gorham was quoted as saying that he would be using the ENGL Fireball head for the January 2011 tour of the UK with Thin Lizzy.

Early in 2016 Gorham returned to Marshall Amplification, playing through DSL100 heads and 1960BX cabs.

==Personal life==

Gorham is married and lives in London. His nephew Jesse Siebenberg is a professional guitarist currently performing with Lissie. His sister, Vickie, married close friend and Supertramp drummer Bob Siebenberg.

<doc id="585415" wikidata="Q660059" url="?curid=585415" title="Tentacle">
<text>In zoology, a tentacle is a flexible, mobile, and elongated organ present in some species of animals, most of them invertebrates. In animal anatomy, tentacles usually occur in one or more pairs. Anatomically, the tentacles of animals work mainly like muscular hydrostats. Most forms of tentacles are used for grasping and feeding. Many are sensory organs, variously receptive to touch, vision, or to the smell or taste of particular foods or threats. Examples of such tentacles are the eyestalks of various kinds of snails. Some kinds of tentacles have both sensory and manipulatory functions.

A tentacle is similar to a cirrus, but a cirrus is an organ that usually lacks the tentacle&#x27;s strength, size, flexibility, or sensitivity. A nautilus has cirri, but a squid has tentacles.

==Invertebrates==

=== Molluscs ===

Many molluscs have tentacles of one form or another. The most familiar are those of the pulmonate land snails, which usually have two sets of tentacles on the head: when extended the upper pair have eyes at their tips; the lower pair are chemoreceptors. Both pairs are fully retractable muscular hydrostats, but they are not used for manipulation or prey capture. Molluscs have one pair of tentacles close to their mouths that hold close to their captured prey before they can consume it.

Some marine snails such as abalone and top snails, Trochidae, have numerous small tentacles around the edge of the mantle. These are known as &quot;pallial tentacles&quot;.

Among cephalopods, squid have spectacular tentacles. They take the form of highly mobile muscular hydrostats with various appendages such as suction disks and sometimes thorny hooks. Up to the early twentieth century &quot;tentacles&quot; were interchangeably called &quot;arms&quot;. These tentacles are made of stalks of axial nerve cords that are covered by circular transverse muscle tissue that contract in response to stimuli. There is a layer of helical muscle that helps each tentacle to twist or turn in any direction where the prey is sensed.

The modern convention, however, is to speak of appendages as &quot;tentacles&quot; when they have relatively thin &quot;peduncles&quot; or &quot;stalks&quot; with &quot;clubs&quot; at their tips. In contrast the convention refers to the relatively shorter appendages as &quot;arms&quot;. By this definition the eight appendages of octopuses, though quite long, count as arms. While arms are distinct from tentacles (a definition specific to the limb featuring peduncles), arms do fall within the general definition of &quot;tentacle&quot; as &quot;a flexible, mobile, and elongated organ&quot; and &quot;tentacle&quot; could be used as an umbrella term.

The tentacles of the giant squid and colossal squid have powerful suckers and pointed teeth at the ends. The teeth of the giant squid resemble bottle caps and function like tiny hole saws, while the tentacles of the colossal squid wield two long rows of swiveling, tri-pointed hooks.

===Cnidarians===
Cnidarians, such as jellyfish, sea anemones, &quot;Hydra&quot; and coral have numerous hair-like tentacles. Cnidarians have huge numbers of cnidocytes on their tentacles. In medusoid form, the body floats on water so that the tentacles hang down in a ring around the mouth. In polyp form, such as sea anemone and coral, the body is below with the tentacles pointed upwards.

The tentacles of the lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish may be up to long. They are hollow and are arranged in 8 groups of between 70 and 150. The longer tentacles are equipped with cnidocytes whose venom paralyses and kills prey. The smaller tentacles guide food into the mouth.

===Ctenophores===
Many species of the jellyfish-like ctenophores have two tentacles, while some have none. Their tentacles have adhesive structures called &quot;colloblasts&quot; or &quot;lasso cells&quot;. The colloblasts burst open when prey comes in contact with the tentacle, releasing sticky threads that secure the food.

===Bryozoa===

Bryozoa (moss animals) are tiny creatures with tentacles around their mouths. The tentacles are almost cylindrical and have bands of cilia which create a water current towards the mouth. The animal extracts edible material from the flow of water.

===Trypanorhynch cestodes===

Trypanorhynch cestodes are parasitic in fish. Their scolex shows four tentacles which are covered by spines. These tentacles help the adult cestode to attach to the intestine of the shark or ray that they parasitize. The same tentacles are also present in the larvae.

==Vertebrates==

===Amphibians===
The legless amphibians called caecilians have two short tentacles, one on each side of the head, between their eyes and nostrils. The current opinion is that these tentacles supplement the normal sense of smell, possibly for navigation and to locate prey underground.

===Mammals===
The star-nosed mole, &quot;Condylura cristata&quot;, of North America, has 22 short but conspicuous tentacles around its nose. They are mobile and extremely sensitive, helping the animal to find its way about the burrow and detect prey. They are about 1–4 mm long and hold about 25,000 touch receptors called Eimer&#x27;s organs, perhaps giving this mole the most delicate sense of touch among mammals.

==Tentillum== 
The word tentillum (: tentilla) literally means &quot;little tentacle&quot;. However, irrespective of size, it usually refers to a side branch of a larger tentacle. In some cases, such tentilla are specialised for particular functions; for example, in the Cnidaria tentilla usually bear cnidocytes, whereas in the Ctenophora they usually have collocytes. Siphonophores are an example of Cnidaria that use tentilla.

<doc id="585416" wikidata="Q648716" url="?curid=585416" title="National Assembly (Hungary)">
<text>The National Assembly ( ) is the parliament of Hungary. The unicameral body consists of 199 (386 between 1990 and 2014) members elected to four-year terms. Election of members is done using a semi-proportional representation: a mixed-member majoritarian representation with partial compensation via transfer votes and mixed single vote; involving single-member districts and one list vote; parties must win at least 5% of the popular vote in order to gain list seats. The Assembly includes 25 standing committees to debate and report on introduced bills and to supervise the activities of the ministers. The Constitutional Court of Hungary has the right to challenge legislation on the grounds of constitutionality.

Under communist rule, the National Assembly existed as the supreme organ of state power as the sole branch of government in Hungary, and per the principle of unified power, all state organs were subservient to it. Since 1902, the assembly has met in the Hungarian Parliament Building in Budapest.

The current members are the members of the National Assembly of Hungary (2022–2026).

== History ==
The Diet of Hungary () was a legislative institution in the medieval kingdom of Hungary from the 1290s, and in its successor states, Royal Hungary and the Habsburg kingdom of Hungary throughout the Early Modern period. The name of the legislative body was originally &quot;Parlamentum&quot; during the Middle Ages, the &quot;Diet&quot; expression gained mostly in the Early Modern period. It convened at regular intervals with interruptions during the period of 1527 to 1918, and again until 1946.

In 1608, an English style(two houses) parliament(estate&#x27;s assembly) was enacted as the Royal Hungarian Diet, dividing the main board and the lower board (the board of envoys). The members of the main board ( &quot;Upper House&quot;, similar as the &quot; House of Lords&quot; in England) were the high nobles and high priests (archbishops and bishops), by birth or by office. The Lower House (similar as the &quot;House of Commons&quot; in England) was attended by representatives of the common nobility, clergy and civil order: elected representatives of the noble county, delegates of the free royal cities and representatives of the lower Church representatives.

Approximately 10% of the total voting age population could vote for the elected delegates of the lower board (5% county nobility, 5% residents of free royal cities). The election of the noble delegates (1-1 delegate from each county) took place in the county delegate elections, after a long, noisy courtier campaign, at the county hall. Delegates had issues from county assemblies about voting in exact things. 

The parliament consisted of about 500 people in the 17th–18th centuries

The articles of the 1790 diet set out that the diet should meet at least once every 3 years, but, since the diet was called by the Habsburg monarchy, this promise was not kept on several occasions thereafter. As a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, it was reconstituted in 1867.

The Latin term &quot;Natio Hungarica&quot; (&quot;Hungarian nation&quot;) was used to designate the political elite which had participation in the diet, consisting of the nobility, the Catholic clergy, and a few enfranchised burghers, regardless of language or ethnicity. Natio Hungarica was a geographic, institutional and juridico-political category.

The democratic character of the Hungarian parliament was reestablished with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the end of the communist dictatorship in 1989. Today&#x27;s parliament is still called the &quot;Országgyűlés,&quot; as in royal times, but is called the &#x27;National Assembly&#x27; to distance itself from the historical royal diet.

<doc id="585418" wikidata="Q923292" url="?curid=585418" title="Constitutional Court of Hungary">
<text>The Constitutional Court of Hungary () is a special court of Hungary, making judicial review of the acts of the Parliament of Hungary. The official seat of the Constitutional Court is Budapest. Until 2012 the seat was Esztergom.

The Constitutional Court is composed of 15 justices since September 1, 2011 (previously, the Court was composed of 11 justices). The members then elect the President of the Court (Chief Justice) from among its members in a secret ballot. One or two vice-presidents, appointed by the President of the Court, stand in for the President in the event of his absence for any reason. The constitutional court passes on the constitutionality of laws, and there is no right of appeal on these decisions. The Constitutional Court serves as the main body for the protection of the Constitution, its tasks being the review of the constitutionality of statutes, and the protection of constitutional order and fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The Constitutional Court performs its tasks independently. With its own budget and its justices being elected by Parliament it does not constitute a part of the ordinary judicial system.

==Establishment==
On 19 October 1989, the Hungarian Parliament passed a resolution on the establishment of the Constitutional Court. Its organization and authority, however, had been determined earlier in the framework of the trilateral political roundtable negotiations preparing the democratic transformation of the political system.
The basic provisions on the Constitutional Court were laid down in October 1989 by Parliament by way of amending the Constitution (Article 32/A). The court was set up in order to promote the establishment of a state governed by the rule of law as well as the protection of constitutional order and fundamental rights. Act XXXII of 1989 on the Constitutional Court was passed by Parliament on 19 October 1989, and the Constitutional Court started its work on 1 January 1990.

==Changes made by the 2011 Constitution==

The following changes were drafted:

==Chief Justices==

* László Sólyom (July 1, 1990 – November 24, 1998)
* János Németh (November 24, 1998 – July 31, 2003)
* András Holló (August 1, 2003 – November 12, 2005)
* Mihály Bihari (November 12, 2005 – July 2, 2008)
* Péter Paczolay (July 3, 2008 – February 24, 2015)
* Barnabás Lenkovics (February 25, 2015 – April 21, 2016)
* Tamás Sulyok (April 21, 2016 – March 4, 2024)
* &quot;László Salamon&quot; (&quot;acting&quot;, March 4, 2024 – June 11, 2024)
* Imre Juhász (June 11, 2024 – &quot;present&quot;)

==Justices==
The Hungarian Constitution declares that members of the Constitutional Court shall be elected by Parliament. It also determines the rules of such elections. Impartiality is guaranteed by having proposed members of the Constitutional Court to be put forward by a nominating committee consisting of one member each from the factions of parties represented in Parliament and shall be elected by a two-thirds majority of all Members of Parliament. Hungarian law provides that only jurists of outstanding theoretical knowledge or having at least twenty years of legal practice may be elected members of the Constitutional Court. Membership is for a term of nine years and members may be re-elected once. In December 2013, the upper age limit in place for Constitutional Court justices was abolished.

The present composition of the court includes the following justices:

* Elemér Balogh (1958)
* Egon Dienes-Oehm (1945)
* Imre Juhász (1963)
* László Kiss (1951)
* Barnabás Lenkovics (1950)
* Miklós Lévay (1954)
* Péter Paczolay (1956)
* Béla Pokol (1950)
* László Salamon (1947)
* István Stumpf (1957)
* Péter Szalay (1960)
* Mária Szívós (1949)
* András Zs. Varga (1968)

==Controversy over new constitution==
On 1 March 2013, the Princeton University international constitutional law scholar and Hungary specialist Kim Lane Scheppele reported that the Hungarian ruling party&#x27;s supermajority is re-introducing in one &quot;mega-amendment&quot; multiple constitutional amendments which had been introduced before and nullified by the Constitutional Court or changed at the insistence of European bodies. The new constitutional mega-amendment again puts an end to the independence of the judiciary, brings universities under still more governmental control, opens the door to political prosecutions, criminalizes homelessness, makes the recognition of religious groups dependent on their cooperation with the government and weakens human rights guarantees across the board. In addition, the constitution will now buffer the government from further financial sanctions by permitting it to pass on all fines for noncompliance with the constitution or with European law to the Hungarian population as special taxes, not payable by the normal state budget. The mega-amendment annuls all of the decisions made by the Court before 1 January 2012 so that they have no legal effect. Henceforth no longer can anyone in the country – neither the Constitutional Court, nor the ordinary courts, nor human rights groups nor ordinary citizens – rely on the Court&#x27;s prior string of rights-protecting decisions.

György Schöpflin—formerly Jean Monnet Professor of Politics at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College London and currently member of the European Parliament for Viktor Orban&#x27;s party, Fidesz—has stated that the assertions of Kim Lane Scheppele „are teeming with misunderstandings, errors of fact, misreadings and ill-will.&quot; Analyzing the blog entry of the Princeton constitutional law professor, Ferenc Kumin—Deputy State Secretary for International Communication of the Hungarian Government—also states that on the one hand it has conceptual errors, because it constructs a narrative based on half-information gained only from opposition sources. A typical example of this is the case of homelessness, which is of course not criminalized in Hungary. The amendment declares that &quot;in order to preserve the public order, public safety, public health and cultural values&quot; the government may prohibit living in the streets, but the same amendment also says that the government is to ensure the right to housing, and the government has invested a considerable amount in shelters in the interest of the homeless as well as the general public. These are not mentioned in the blog entry of Scheppele. On the other hand, according to Kumin, the entry is full of factual mistakes as well, of which the worst is the question of the decisions of the previous Court, which are and will be valid – contrary to Scheppele&#x27;s text. Therefore, Kumin – quoting her other mistakes as well - concludes that the blog-entry did not meet the criteria of an objective analysis, and can be seen only as a political opinion.

On 5 March 2013, Michael Link, undersecretary in the German Foreign Ministry, in &quot;Hungary must remain a country of the law,&quot; called on Hungary &quot;to demonstrate that the country has an effective separation of power between the legislative and the judicial.&quot;

On 6 March 2013, Europe&#x27;s main human rights watchdog, Council of Europe President Thorbjorn Jagland, said that the amendments set to be voted on next week by Hungarian lawmakers might have been incompatible with European legal principles and asked Hungary to postpone the approval of a series of constitutional amendments so legal experts can review the changes.

On 7 March 2013, Deputy Prime Minister Navracsics sent a letter to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe Thorbjorn Jagland, to give some additional written explanations to the Proposal on the Fourth Amendment to Fundamental Law of Hungary.

On 8 March 2013, the government of the United States raised its concerns both about the content of the proposed amendments &quot;as they could threaten the principles of institutional independence and checks and balances that are the hallmark of democratic governance&quot; and about the process by which they were to be accepted: &quot;[The USA] urges the Government of Hungary and the Parliament to ensure that the process of considering amendments to the constitution demonstrates respect for the rule of law and judicial review, openness to the views of other stakeholders across Hungarian society, and continuing receptiveness to the expertise of the Council of Europe&#x27;s Venice Commission.&quot;

On 8 March 2013, in a letter to the European Commission, Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, and counterparts in Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland called for the European Union to be given new powers allowing it to freeze EU budget funds to a member state in breach of Europe&#x27;s &quot;fundamental values.&quot; On the same day, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso too expressed concerns to Prime Minister Viktor Orban over the amendment vote in Hungary&#x27;s parliament next week to change the constitution, arguing it contravenes EU rules in areas such as the judiciary.

On 8 March 2013, Minister of Foreign Affairs, János Martonyi sent letter to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of EU-member states, in which he gave details on the text of the amendment.

On 11 March 2013, &quot;Hungary&#x27;s parliament, dominated by Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x27;s Fidesz party, adopted changes to the country&#x27;s constitution on Monday despite warnings from the European Union and the U.S. government that the changes could weaken Hungary&#x27;s democracy. The legislation was supported by 265 lawmakers in the 386-seat chamber, with 11 votes against and 33 abstentions.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot; column of Nobel Laureate economist Paul Krugman, Princeton University international constitutional scholar and Hungary specialist Professor Kim Lane Scheppele writes:
:&quot;The Hungarian Parliament [on March 11, 2013] passed a 15-page amendment to its one-year-old constitution against a storm of protest from both home and abroad. If it is signed by the Hungarian President, János Áder, the &quot;Fourth Amendment&quot; will wipe out more than 20 years of Constitutional Court decisions protecting human rights and it will reverse concessions made to Europe over the last year of difficult bargaining as the Fidesz government has tightened its grip on power…. But Hungary&#x27;s allies should see through the fog of amendment. By now it should be clear that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party recognize no limitations in their quest for power.&quot;

Critiques have also been made in the official working documents of the European Parliament and by the Venice Commission on Hungary.

<text>A roadblock is a temporary installation set up to control or block traffic along a road. The reasons for one could be:
*Roadworks
*Temporary road closure during special events
*Police chase
*Robbery
*Sobriety checkpoint
*Protests

In peaceful circumstances, they are usually installed by the police or road transport authorities; they are also commonly employed during wars and are usually staffed by heavily armed soldiers in that case. During protests and riots, both police and demonstrators sometimes use roadblocks.

<text>In fluid dynamics, the capillary number (Ca) is a dimensionless quantity representing the relative effect of viscous drag forces versus surface tension forces acting across an interface between a liquid and a gas, or between two immiscible liquids. Alongside the Bond number, commonly denoted formula_1, this term is useful to describe the forces acting on a fluid front in porous or granular media, such as soil. The capillary number is defined as:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid, formula_4 is a characteristic velocity and formula_5 is the surface tension or interfacial tension between the two fluid phases.

Being a dimensionless quantity, the capillary number&#x27;s value does not depend on the system of units. In the petroleum industry, capillary number is denoted formula_6 instead of formula_7.

For low capillary numbers (a rule of thumb says less than 10−5), flow in porous media is dominated by capillary forces, whereas for high capillary numbers the capillary forces are negligible compared to the viscous forces. Flow through the pores in an oil reservoir has capillary number values in the order of 10−6, whereas flow of oil through an oil well drill pipe has a capillary number in the order of unity.

The capillary number plays a role in the dynamics of capillary flow; in particular, it governs the dynamic contact angle of a flowing droplet at an interface.

== Multiphase formulation ==
Multiphase flows forms when two or more partially or immiscible fluids are brought in contact. The capillary number in multiphase flow has the same definition as the single flow formulation, the ratio of viscous to surface forces but has the added(?) effect of the ratio of fluid viscosities:  

formula_8

where formula_9 and formula_10 are the viscosity of the continuous and the dispersed phases respectively.

Multiphase microflows are characterized by the ratio of viscous to surface forces, the capillary number (Ca), and by the ratio of fluid viscosities:

formula_11 and formula_12

<text>The cherimoya (Annona cherimola), also spelled chirimoya and called chirimuya by the Quechua people, is a species of edible fruit-bearing plant in the genus &quot;Annona&quot;, from the family Annonaceae, which includes the closely related sweetsop and soursop. The plant has long been believed to be native to Ecuador and Peru, with cultivation practised in the Andes and Central America, although a recent hypothesis postulates Central America as the origin instead, because many of the plant&#x27;s wild relatives occur in this area.

Cherimoya is grown in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world including Central America, northern South America, Southern California, South Asia, Australia, the Mediterranean region, and North Africa. American writer Mark Twain called the cherimoya &quot;the most delicious fruit known to men&quot;. The creamy texture of the flesh gives the fruit its secondary name, the custard apple.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Quechua word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;cold seeds&quot;. The plant grows at high altitudes, where the weather is colder, and the seeds will germinate at higher altitudes. In Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, the fruit is commonly known as &quot;chirimoya&quot; (spelled according to the rules of the Spanish language).

==Description==
&quot;Annona cherimola&quot; is a fairly dense, fast-growing, woody, 
briefly deciduous 
but mostly evergreen, low-branched, spreading tree 
or shrub, tall.

Mature branches are sappy and woody. Young branches and twigs have a matting of short, fine, rust-colored hairs. The leathery leaves are long wide, and mostly elliptic, pointed at the ends and rounded near the leaf stalk. When young, they are covered with soft, fine, tangled, rust-colored hairs. When mature, the leaves bear hairs only along the veins on the undersurface. The tops are hairless and a dull medium green with paler veins, the backs are velvety, dull grey-green with raised pale green veins. New leaves are whitish below.

Leaves are single and alternate, dark green, and slightly hairy on the top surface. They attach to branches with stout long and densely hairy leaf stalks.

Cherimoya trees bear very pale green, fleshy flowers. They are long with a very strong, fruity odor. Each flower has three outer, greenish, fleshy, oblong, downy petals and three smaller, pinkish inner petals with yellow or brown, finely matted hairs outside, whitish with purple spots and many stamens on the inside. Flowers appear on the branches opposite to the leaves, solitary or in pairs or groups of three, on flower stalks that are covered densely with fine rust-colored hairs, long. Buds are long and wide at the base. The pollen is shed as permanent tetrads.

===Fruits===
The edible cherimoya fruit is a large, green, conical or heart-shaped compound fruit, long, with diameters of , and skin that gives the appearance of having overlapping scales or knobby warts. They ripen to brown with a fissured surface in late winter and early spring; they weigh on the average , but extra-large specimens may weigh or more.

Cherimoya fruits are commercially classified according to degree of surface irregularity, as follows: &#x27;Lisa&#x27;, almost smooth, difficult to discern areoles; &#x27;Impresa&#x27;, with &quot;fingerprint&quot; depressions; &#x27;Umbonata&#x27;, with rounded protrusions at the apex of each areole; &#x27;Mamilata&#x27; with fleshy, nipple-like protrusions; or &#x27;Tuberculata&#x27;, with conical protrusions having wart-like tips.

The flesh of the cherimoya contains numerous hard, inedible, black, bean-like, glossy seeds, long and about half as wide. Cherimoya seeds are poisonous if crushed open. Like other members of the family Annonaceae, the entire plant contains small amounts of neurotoxic acetogenins, such as annonacin, which appear to be linked to atypical parkinsonism in Guadeloupe. Moreover, an extract of the bark can induce paralysis if injected.

==Distribution and habitat==
Widely cultivated now, &quot;A. cherimola&quot; is believed to have originated in the Andes of South America at altitudes of , although an alternative hypothesis postulates Central America as the origin, instead, because many of the plant&#x27;s wild relatives occur in this area. From there it was taken by Europeans to various parts of the tropics. Unlike other &quot;Annona&quot; species, &quot;A. cherimola&quot; has not successfully naturalized in West Africa, and &quot;Annona glabra&quot; is often misidentified as this species in Australasia.

&quot;A. cherimola&quot; is not native to Chile. When it was introduced is unknown, but it happened likely in pre-Hispanic times. Traditionally, it has been cultivated in the valleys and oases of the north, as far south as the valley of Aconcagua.

==Ecology==
===Pollination===
The flowers of &quot;A. cherimola&quot; are hermaphroditic and have a mechanism to avoid self-pollination. The short-lived flowers open as female, then progress to a later, male stage in a matter of hours. This requires a separate pollinator that not only can collect the pollen from flowers in the male stage, but also deposit it in flowers in the female stage. Studies of which insect(s) serve as the natural pollinator in the cherimoya&#x27;s native region have been inconclusive; some form of beetle is suspected.

Quite often, the female flower is receptive in the early part of the first day, but pollen is not produced in the male stage until the late afternoon of the second day. Honey bees are not good pollinators of this plant, for example, because their bodies are too large to fit between the fleshy petals of the female flower. Female flowers have the petals only partially separated, and the petals separate widely when they become male flowers. So, the bees pick up pollen from the male flowers, but are unable to transfer this pollen to the female flowers. The small beetles which are suspected to pollinate cherimoya in its land of origin must therefore be much smaller than bees.

For fruit production outside the cherimoya&#x27;s native region, cultivators must either rely upon the wind to spread pollen in dense orchards or else use hand pollination. Pollinating by hand requires a paint brush. Briefly, to increase fruit production, growers collect the pollen from the male plants with the brush, and then transfer it to the female flowers immediately or store it in the refrigerator overnight. Cherimoya pollen has a short life, but it can be extended with refrigeration.

===Climate requirements===
The evaluation of 20 locations in Loja Province, Ecuador, indicated certain growing preferences of wild cherimoya, including altitude between , optimum annual temperature range between , annual precipitation between , and soils with high sand content and slightly acidic properties with pH between 5.0 and 6.5.

In Western horticulture, growers are often advised to grow cherimoya in full sun, while the plant has been considered shade-tolerant in Japan. In 2001, a study conducted by Kyoto University showed shading of 50–70% sunlight was adequate to obtain an optimal light environment.

==Cultivation==
===Cultivars===

The cherimoya of the Granada-Málaga tropical coast in Spain is a fruit of the cultivar &#x27;Fino de Jete&#x27; with the EU&#x27;s protected designation of origin appellation. &#x27;Fino de Jete&#x27; fruits have skin type Impressa and are smooth or slightly concave at the edges. The fruit is round, oval, heart-shaped, or kidney-shaped. The seeds are enclosed in the carpels and so do not detach easily. The flavor balances intense sweetness with slight acidity and the soluble sugar content exceeds 17° Bx. This variety is prepared and packed in the geographical area because &quot;it is a very delicate perishable fruit and its skin is very susceptible to browning caused by mechanical damage, such as rubbing, knocks, etc. The fruit must be handled with extreme care, from picking by hand in the field to packing in the warehouse, which must be carried out within 24 hours. Repacking or further handling is strictly forbidden.&quot;
&quot;Annona cherimola&quot;, preferring the cool Andean altitudes, readily hybridizes with other &quot;Annona&quot; species. A hybrid with &quot;A. squamosa&quot; called atemoya has received some attention in West Africa, Australia, Brazil, and Florida.

===Propagation===
The tree thrives throughout the tropics at altitudes of . Though sensitive to frost, it must have periods of cool temperatures or the tree will gradually go dormant. The indigenous inhabitants of the Andes say the cherimoya cannot tolerate snow.

In the Mediterranean region, it is cultivated mainly in southern Spain and Portugal, where it was introduced between 1751 and 1797, after which it was carried to Italy, but now can also be found in several countries of Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania. It is cultivated throughout the Americas, including Hawaii since 1790 and California, where it was introduced in 1871.

===Harvest===
Large fruits which are uniformly green, without cracks or mostly browned skin, are best. The optimum temperature for storage is , depending on cultivar, ripeness stage, and duration, with an optimum relative humidity of 90–95%. Unripe cherimoyas will ripen at room temperature, when they will yield to gentle pressure. Exposure to ethylene (100 ppm for one to two days) accelerates ripening of mature green cherimoya and other &quot;Annona&quot; fruits; they can ripen in about five days if kept at . Ethylene removal can also be helpful in slowing the ripening of mature green fruits.

==Nutrition and edibility==

Raw cherimoya fruit is 79% water, 18% carbohydrate, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a 100-gram reference amount providing 75 calories, cherimoya is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin B6 and a moderate source (10–19% DV) of vitamin C, dietary fiber, and riboflavin (table).

&quot;The pineapple, the mangosteen, and the cherimoya&quot;, wrote the botanist Berthold Carl Seemann, &quot;are considered the finest fruits in the world, and I have tasted them in those localities where they are supposed to attain their highest perfection – the pineapple in Guayaquil, the mangosteen in the Indian Archipelago, and the cherimoya on the slopes of the Andes, and if I were asked which would be the best fruit, I would choose without hesitation, cherimoya. Its taste, indeed, surpasses that of every other fruit, and Haenke was quite right when he called it the masterpiece of Nature.&quot;

Fruits require storage at to inhibit softening and maintain edibility. Different varieties have different flavors, textures, and shapes. The flavor of the flesh ranges from mellow sweet to tangy or acidic sweet, with variable suggestions of pineapple, banana, pear, papaya, strawberry or other berry, and apple, depending on the variety. The ripened flesh is creamy white. When ripe, the skin is green and gives slightly to pressure. Some characterize the fruit flavor as a blend of banana, pineapple, papaya, peach, and strawberry. The fruit can be chilled and eaten with a spoon, which has earned it another nickname, the &quot;ice cream fruit&quot;. In Chile and Peru, it is commonly used in ice creams and yogurt.

When the fruit is ripe and still has the fresh, fully mature green-yellow skin color, the texture is like that of a soft ripe pear or papaya. When the skin turns brown at room temperature, the fruit is no longer good for human consumption.

==Brand==

Chirimoya Cumbe is a well-known case involving collective marks in trademark law. The World Intellectual Property Organization has defined these collective marks as “signs which distinguish the geographical origin, material, mode of manufacturing or other common characteristics of goods or services of different enterprises using the collective mark.” The owner of a collective mark are members of an association of such enterprises. 

Cumbe is a valley in the Huarochiri province of Peru where the climatic conditions are favourable for growing chirimoya. The fruit produced in the Cumbe valley is considered of superior quality, with a large fruit size, soft skin, low seed index (number of seeds per 100 grams of fruit), and high nutrient value.

In 1997, Matildo Pérez, a peasant from a village community in the heights of Lima, decided to apply personally to the National Institute for the Defense of Competition and Intellectual Property of Peru (INDECOPI) for the registration of the trademark &quot;Chirimoya Cumbe.&quot; The application was refused since no exclusive rights in generic names can be granted to a single person. Mr. Pérez appeared at INDECOPI again, this time with a delegation headed by the Deputy Mayor of Cumbe, to register the “Chirimoya Cumbe” as a trademark which would give the community in Lima exclusive rights with respect to the name “Cumbe”. 

The INDECOPI officials explained that &quot;Chirimoya Cumbe&quot; is in fact an appellation of origin, not a trademark. To be more precise, the word “Cumbe” is an appellation of Peruvian origin, because the valley of Cumbe is a geographical area that gives certain distinctive properties to the Chirimoya grown there.

The people of Cumbe declined the proposition of appellation of origin: &quot;It is said that with appellations of origin the State is the owner, and it is the State that authorizes use, and that is why we are saying no. We do not want the State to be the owner of the ‘Cumbe’ name.&quot;

After lengthy search for solutions, it was suggested that “Chirimoya Cumbe” should be registered as a “collective mark”, the owners of which would be the people of Cumbe and which would be used according to rules that they themselves would lay down.

In 2022, the name &quot;Chirimoya Cumbe&quot; has its own characteristic logo and is registered as a collective mark in the name of the village of Santo Toribio de Cumbe (in Class 31 of the International Classification).

==Culture==
The Moche culture of Peru had a fascination with agriculture and represented fruits and vegetables in their art; cherimoyas were often depicted in their ceramics.

<text>Thyreophora (&quot;shield bearers&quot;, often known simply as &quot;armored dinosaurs&quot;) is a group of armored ornithischian dinosaurs that lived from the Early Jurassic until the end of the Cretaceous.

Thyreophorans are characterized by the presence of body armor lined up in longitudinal rows along the body. Primitive forms had simple, low, keeled scutes or osteoderms, whereas more derived forms developed more elaborate structures including spikes and plates. Most thyreophorans were herbivorous and had relatively small brains for their body size.

Thyreophora includes two major subgroups, Ankylosauria and Stegosauria. In both clades, the forelimbs were much shorter than the hindlimbs, particularly in stegosaurs. Thyreophora has been defined as the group consisting of all species more closely related to &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; than to &quot;Iguanodon&quot; and &quot;Triceratops&quot;. It is the sister group of Cerapoda within Genasauria.

== Characteristics ==
Members of Thyreophora are characterised by the presence of osteoderms (bony growths within the skin), with these osteoderms having lateral keels. Characters of the skull and jaws distinctive (synapomorphic) of thyreophorans include &quot;absence of a deep elliptic fossa along the sutural line of the nasals, presence of a wide jugal, remodeling of skull dermal bone, down-turned dentary tooth row&quot;. Among primitive thyreophorans, &quot;Scutellosaurus&quot; was likely primarily bipedal, while the more quadrupedally adapted &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot; may have been bipedal for some of the time, particularly as a juvenile. Stegosaurs and ankylosaurs are thought to have been obligately quadrupedal.

==Classification==

===Taxonomy===
While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, a few 21st century publications have retained the use of ranks, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most have listed Thyreophora as an unranked taxon containing the traditional suborders Stegosauria and Ankylosauria, though Thyreophora is also sometimes classified as a suborder, with Ankylosauria and Stegosauria as infraorders.

===Phylogeny===
Thyreophora was first named by Nopcsa in 1915. Thyreophora was defined as a clade by Paul Sereno in 1998, as &quot;all genasaurs more closely related to &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; than to &quot;Triceratops&quot;. Thyreophoroidea was first named by Nopcsa in 1928 and defined by Sereno in 1986, as &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants&quot;. Eurypoda was first named by Sereno in 1986 and defined by him in 1998, as &quot;&quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, their most recent common ancestor and all of their descendants&quot;.

In 2021, an international group of researchers led by Daniel Madzia registered almost all of the most commonly used ornithischian clades under the International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature, with the intent of standardizing their definitions. According to Madzia &quot;et al.&quot;, Thyreophora is defined as the largest clade containing &quot;Ankylosaurus magniventris&quot; and &quot;Stegosaurus stenops&quot; but not &quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot; and &quot;Triceratops horridus&quot;. They also defined the less inclusive Eurypoda as &quot;the smallest clade containing &quot;Ankylosaurus magniventris&quot; and &quot;Stegosaurus stenops&quot;&quot; to include the ankylosaurs and stegosaurs to the exclusion of basal thyreophorans. A later study conducted by André Fonseca and colleagues in 2024 gave a formal definition for Thyreophoroidea in the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; as &quot;the smallest clade containing &quot;Ankylosaurus magniventris&quot;, &quot;Scelidosaurus harrisonii&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus stenops&quot;&quot;.

The following cladogram shows the results of the phylogenetic analysis Soto-Acuña &quot;et al&quot;. (2021). In their description of &quot;Jakapil&quot; the following year, Riguetti &quot;et al&quot; modified the same matrix and found it to occupy a position as the sister taxon to the Eurypoda. A similar result was found by Fonseca et al. in 2024.

In 2020, as part of his monograph on &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot;, David Norman revised the relationships of early thyreophorans, finding that Stegosauria was the most basal branch, with &quot;Scutellosaurus&quot;, &quot;Emausaurus&quot; and &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot; being progressive stem groups to Ankylosauria, rather than to Stegosauria+Ankylosauria. A cladogram is given below:

<doc id="585472" wikidata="Q4996134" url="?curid=585472" title="Bulfinch's Mythology">
<text>Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology is a collection of tales from myth and legend rewritten for a general readership by the American Latinist and banker Thomas Bulfinch, published after his death in 1867. The work was a successful popularization of Greek mythology for English-speaking readers.

Carl J. Richard comments (with John Talbot of Brigham Young University concurring) that it was &quot;one of the most popular books ever published in the United States and the standard work on classical mythology for nearly a century&quot;, until the release of classicist Edith Hamilton&#x27;s 1942 &quot;Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot;. By 1987, there were more than 100 editions of &quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot; in the National Union Catalog, and in a survey of amazon.com in November 2014 there were 229 print editions and 19 ebooks. Talbot opined that, of the many available, Richard P. Martin&#x27;s 1991 edition is &quot;by far the most useful and extensive critical treatment&quot;.

==Contents==
The book is a prose recounting of myths and stories from three eras: Greek and Roman mythology, King Arthur legends and medieval romances. Bulfinch intersperses the stories with his own commentary, and with quotations from writings by his contemporaries that refer to the story under discussion. This combination of classical elements and modern literature was novel for his time.

Bulfinch expressly intended his work for the general reader, and not as a school textbook but as &quot;a classical dictionary for the parlour&quot;. In the preface to &quot;The Age of Fable&quot; he states &quot;Our work is not for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation.&quot; Despite this, the &quot;Mythology&quot; did actually displace earlier, and more comprehensive, school textbooks in the United States such as Andrew Tooke&#x27;s 1698 &quot;Pantheon&quot;, an English translation of 1659 Latin &quot;Pantheum Mysticum&quot;.

Five Colleges associate and classics teacher Marie S. Cleary described &quot;The Age of Fable&quot; as an &quot;abridged, bowdlerized, and rearranged Ovid&quot;, a description that was also applied by Victor Bers in his overview of mythographic literature in &quot;Yale Review&quot; in 1985. Most of the material in it was drawn from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, mainly in much the same arrangement including the story of Prometheus followed by Apollo and Daphne, Arachne being linked to Niobe, and Pythagoras following the classical myths. There are additional chapters on &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Northern&quot; mythology, Apuleius&#x27; &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;, and some material from Virgil. Some structural differences from Ovid include the combination of Latona with Io, Callisto, and Actaeon instead of Niobe.

As an example of the abridgment and bowdlerization, Ovid&#x27;s telling of the story of Proserpine in the Underworld is, at over 300 hexameters, twice as long as Bulfinch&#x27;s; from which the latter omits several subplots, condenses Ovid&#x27;s fragmentary account of Arethusa, and excludes or alters all of Ovid&#x27;s sexual references (e.g. Proserpine tucking flowers into her apron rather than into her bosom as Ovid had it). In general, Bulfinch excludes anything where Ovid is bawdy, and minimizes any violence and grotesquery. Prometheus is platonic rather than wily and cunning as Hesiod had him.

Bulfinch added to the stories what he termed &quot;poetical citations&quot;, drawn from the works of 40 poets (all but three of whom, Longfellow, Lowell, and Bullfinch&#x27;s brother Stephen Greenleaf, were British). These were illustrations of the use of the mythological tales in English literature.

The tales are structured to flow better than a straightforward encyclopedic or dictionary treatment of them would: Ariadne being used as a common character, for example, to link the tales of Bacchus and Theseus.

By combining classical learning with modern (19th century) literature, Bulfinch sought to give readers a way to connect such distant information to their contemporary lives, a pedagogical approach that, in contrast with Bulfinch&#x27;s later reputation for being a prudish Victorian, was actually advanced for its time and only later to be seen in the work of John Dewey. Although not aimed at reading solely &quot;for&quot; pleasure, Bulfinch sought to offer a means of learning &quot;as&quot; pleasure, a &quot;useful knowledge&quot; that in turn would enhance the pleasure in reading other works.

He viewed the fact that in order to learn about classical mythology, people first had to learn classical languages, which was a stumbling block on the road to learning, and that the era&#x27;s greater emphasis on learning the sciences meant that there was less time to learn the classics, and as a consequence less understanding of a broad range of literature which referenced classical mythology. Thus his target readership was that of people with no education in Latin or Greek, a growing section of the middle classes in North America and the United Kingdom at the time, who wished to learn the classics but were hampered by what was termed at the time an &quot;English education&quot;. In an age of science, he was not expecting people to &quot;devote study to a species of learning that relates wholly to false marvels of obsolete faiths&quot;, but rather he sought to enable people to better comprehend English literature, and his concluding every myth account with the &quot;poetical citations&quot; indicates that it was learning the English literature that was the point rather than learning the classical mythology.
This is further indicated by his selection of the mythology, and his preference for things like the Keats version of Glaucus and Scylla (from &quot;Endymion&quot;) rather than any classical poet&#x27;s version of the tale.

==Publication history==
Bulfinch originally published his work as three volumes: &quot;The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes&quot;, published in 1855; &quot;The Age of Chivalry, or Legends of King Arthur&quot;, published in 1858; and &quot;Legends of Charlemagne, or Romance of the Middle Ages,&quot; published in 1863. Bulfinch&#x27;s original three volumes were posthumously combined into a single volume by Edward Everett Hale in 1881, who gave them the title &quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot;.

Some, but not all, editions of &quot;The Age of Fable&quot; were dedicated to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

Bulfinch himself published the &quot;poetical citations&quot; standalone as &quot;Poetry of the Age of Fable&quot; in 1863. In contrast, Macmillan published a &quot;simplified&quot; edition in 1942 that omitted all of Bulfinch&#x27;s references to literature.

<text>The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) is a United Kingdom Ministry of Defence research facility responsible for the design, manufacture and support of warheads for the UK&#x27;s nuclear weapons. It is the successor to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) with its main site on the former RAF Aldermaston and has major facilities at Burghfield, Blacknest and RNAD Coulport.

AWE plc, responsible for the day-to-day operations of AWE, is owned by the Ministry of Defence and operated as a non-departmental public body.

Until June 2021, AWE plc was owned by a consortium of Jacobs Engineering Group, Lockheed Martin UK, and Serco through AWE Management Ltd, which held a 25‑year contract (until March 2025) to operate AWE, although all the sites remained owned by the Government of the United Kingdom which had a golden share in AWE plc. In November 2020, it was announced that the Ministry of Defence had triggered a contractual break point and would take ownership of AWE Plc in July 2021.

The establishment is the final destination for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament&#x27;s Aldermaston Marches march from Trafalgar Square, London. The first Aldermaston March was conceived by the Direct Action Committee and took place in 1958.

==History==

===Atomic Weapons Research Establishment===
The British nuclear weapons programme, then operating under the project name &#x27;High Explosive Research&#x27; within the Ministry of Supply, established operations on 1 April 1950 at the former RAF Aldermaston airfield. The airfield was constructed in World War II and had been used by the Royal Air Force and the United States&#x27;s Eighth and Ninth Air Force as a troop carrier (C‑47) group base, and was assigned USAAF station No 467. In 1952, the High Explosive Research project was renamed the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE), with William Penney appointed as the first director.

===Changes in ownership===
In 1954 AWRE was transferred to the newly created United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). In 1971, under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1971, the production activities of UKAEA were transferred to the newly created British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. (BNFL).

In 1973 AWRE was transferred to the Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence, see Atomic Energy Authority (Weapons Group) Act 1973. Parts of AWRE&#x27;s weapons production processes were carried out at two Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs): ROF Burghfield and ROF Cardiff. In 1984 these two ROFs were separated from the other ROFs, which were then formed into a government-owned defence company, Royal Ordnance plc and was privatised in 1987. ROF Burghfield and ROF Cardiff remained within the Procurement Executive and came under the control of AWRE.

===The formation of AWE===
In 1987, AWRE was combined with ROF Burghfield and ROF Cardiff to form the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), these sites being renamed AWE Burghfield and AWE Cardiff (the latter was closed in 1997).

It remained with the Ministry of Defence, Procurement Executive. However, in 1989, the UK government announced its intention to find a suitable private company to run AWE under a Government Owned/Contractor Operated (GO‑CO) arrangement.

===Private management===
In 1993 the government awarded a contract to Hunting-BRAE, a consortium of Hunting Engineering, Brown and Root and AEA Technology. During Hunting-BRAE&#x27;s management AWE decommissioned the RAFs WE177 freefall nuclear bomb. In 1998 the company suffered two prosecutions for safety breaches, one for discharge of tritium into a nearby stream and another for an incident where two workers inhaled plutonium.

In 1999 Hunting-BRAE lost the contract to AWE Management Ltd (AWE ML), a consortium of BNFL, Lockheed Martin and Serco. AWE ML&#x27;s subsidiary, AWE plc, assumed responsibility for the operation of all AWE sites on 1 April 2000. This was not full privatisation as the Ministry of Defence continued to own all the AWE sites as well as a golden share in AWE plc.

Critics pointed out that BNFL and Lockheed Martin did not have perfect safety records either. BNFL suffered embarrassing revelations of falsified quality checks in nuclear fuels and Lockheed was the subject of scathing reports on the operation of US nuclear facilities. Lockheed&#x27;s failings included safety concerns at the Y-12 facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, an American weapons plant similar in certain ways to Aldermaston.

During the 2007 United Kingdom floods, the flood waters affected the Atomic Weapons Establishment, which handles the United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear warheads, resulting in a suspension of work for almost a year.

In December 2008, the BNFL share in AWE Management Ltd was sold to Jacobs Engineering Group, an American engineering services company.

Since about 2013 the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has given both AWE sites enhanced regulatory attention due to &quot;safety and compliance concerns, and the continued undertaking of operations in ageing facilities due to delays to the delivery of modern standard replacement facilities.&quot; The ONR anticipated AWE would move back to normal regulatory attention in 2021 after the new facilities are completed.

Scientists at AWE were involved in testing for radioactive poison after the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. No gamma rays were detected; however, the BBC reported that a scientist at AWE, who had worked on Britain&#x27;s early atomic bomb programme decades before, recognised a small spike at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV) as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, a critical component of early nuclear bombs, which led to the correct diagnosis. Further tests using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha radiation confirmed the result.

In July 2015 the Office for Nuclear Regulation issued an improvement notice to AWE demanding that it demonstrate that it has a long-term strategy for managing Higher Active radioactive Waste in order to reduce the risk to the public and its employees.

In 2011 a project named MENSA to construct a new warhead assembly and disassembly facility at Burghfield had been approved, to be completed in 2017 at a cost £734 million. In 2020, a National Audit Office report found that costs had increased by £1.07 billion to £1.8 billion and completion date had slipped to 2023. Construction was begun before design had been finalised and risk was not shared with contractors, so they were not incentivised to control costs.

===Return to government management===
In November 2020, it was announced that the Ministry of Defence had triggered a contractual break point and would take ownership of AWE Plc in July 2021. Sir John Manzoni was announced as chair-designate, and he formally took on the role of chair of the board on 1 July 2021.

==Operations==

===AWE&#x27;s responsibilities===
AWE is tasked to help the United Kingdom maintain a credible and effective minimum nuclear deterrent:
* To maintain the warheads for the Trident nuclear deterrent safely and reliably in service.
* To maintain a capability to design a new weapon, should it ever be required.
* To complete the dismantling and disposal of redundant warheads replaced by Trident.
* To develop the skills, technologies and techniques that could underpin future arms limitation treaties.

A significant programme of investment took place over the three-year period from 2005 to 2008, of about £350 million per year, to provide assurance that the existing Trident missile warhead is reliable and safe throughout its intended in-service life. The new facilities and extra supporting infrastructure are required in the absence of live nuclear testing no longer allowed under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

AWE co-operates with the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States and other American nuclear weapons laboratories in carrying out subcritical nuclear tests at the Nevada underground test site to obtain scientific data to maintain the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons. Subcritical tests are not banned by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons. The most recent test took place in February 2006.

The cost of decommissioning AWE facilities when they become redundant, including nuclear waste disposal, was estimated at £3.4 billion in 2005.

===Safety record===
On 3 August 2010 a fire broke out in the explosives processing area at AWE Aldermaston, resulting in the evacuation of nearby residents from their homes. Investigations by a local newspaper revealed that from 1 April 2000, to 5 August 2011, 158 fires broke out at AWE sites, with the fire brigade being called out to deal with alarms on average four times a week over this period. The Health and Safety Executive took the decision to prosecute AWE plc on three charges relating to health and safety after their investigation into the fire in 2010, the first hearing in this case being held on 6 August 2012. On 16 May 2013 AWE pleaded guilty to a single offence contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

===Security breaches===
In 2013 a whistleblower alerted the authorities to lapses in security caused by misconduct among police officers guarding the base. The MoD said that security was never threatened, but MoD police considered it a &quot;critical&quot; incident. Six officers were dismissed for gross misconduct and 25 resigned.

==AWE Blacknest==
Formerly part of the Ministry of Defence, AWE Blacknest has, for over 40 years, specialised in forensic seismology, researching techniques to distinguish the seismic signals generated by underground nuclear explosions from those generated by earthquakes. It is approximately 1 mile west of the main AWE site.

Blacknest&#x27;s main function is to develop and maintain expertise in using seismic techniques to detect and identify underground explosions. This expertise and the techniques have been used in the past to provide assessments for the UK government on nuclear explosions carried out by other countries. The expertise is to be used as part of Britain&#x27;s contribution to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which was signed in 1996, but which, as of 2015, has not come into force.

<text>The Sydenham River is a river in Chatham-Kent, Lambton County and Middlesex County in southwestern Ontario, Canada, flowing southwest from its source west of London, Ontario and emptying into Lake Saint Clair. The length of the river is and it drains a watershed of approximately . The river flows through the towns of Strathroy and Wallaceburg. It was named after Lord Sydenham, governor of Canada from 1839 to 1841.

Unusual concretions, composed of calcite, can be found near this river. These are known as &quot;kettles&quot; because they resemble the bottom of a large kettle.

The river has been identified as a key biodiversity area.

==Fish species==
Because this river flows through a large agricultural area, its waters collect silt and fertilizer runoff. In spite of this, the river provides habitat for 80 fish species and 34 species of freshwater mussels; these include:
;Nine mussel species considered as &quot;endangered&quot; nationally
* Mudpuppy mussel (&quot;Simpsonaias ambigua&quot;)
* Northern riffleshell (&quot;Epioblasma torulosa rangiana&quot;)
* Rayed bean (&quot;Villosa fabalis&quot;)
* Wavy-rayed lampmussel (&quot;Lampsilis fasciola&quot;)
* Snuffbox (&quot;Epioblasma triquetra&quot;)
* Round pigtoe (&quot;Pleurobema sintoxia&quot;)
* Kidneyshell (&quot;Ptychobranchus fasciolaris&quot;)
* Round hickorynut (&quot;Obovaria subrotunda&quot;)
* Rainbow mussel (&quot;Villosa iris&quot;)
;Two fish species and one turtle subspecies considered to be &quot;threatened&quot;
* Spotted gar (&quot;Lepisosteus oculatus&quot;)
* Eastern sand darter (&quot;Ammocrypta pellucida&quot;)
* Eastern spiny softshell turtle (&quot;Trionyx spiniferus spiniferus&quot;)

The Northern madtom (&quot;Noturus stigmosus&quot;), once found in the river, is considered to be &quot;likely extirpated&quot;.

<doc id="585483" wikidata="Q7971803" url="?curid=585483" title="Washington Crossing State Park">
<text>Washington Crossing State Park is a New Jersey state park that is part of Washington&#x27;s Crossing, a U.S. National Historic Landmark area. It is located in the Washington Crossing and Titusville sections of Hopewell Township in Mercer County, north of Trenton along the Delaware River. The park is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry. It is supported by the Washington Crossing Park Association, a friends group that works to preserve, enhance, and advocate for the park.

This park area, together with Washington Crossing Historic Park on the Pennsylvania side, comprise the Washington&#x27;s Crossing National Historic Landmark, which was listed on January 20, 1961, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

The park&#x27;s natural area consists of of mixed hardwood forests and fields that offer locations for hiking, picnics, nature walks and cross-country skiing. The Nature Center offers exhibits, displays, and educational programs for children, families and school groups. During warmer months, concerts and plays were once held at the Washington Crossing Open Air Theatre, an outdoor theater with seating consisting of wooden benches and a stage, but this facility has been abandoned since 2017.

Goat Hill Overlook, located nearby in West Amwell Township in Hunterdon County, is administered by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry as part of Washington Crossing State Park.

==Johnson&#x27;s Ferry==
The park includes the site of George Washington&#x27;s crossing of the Delaware River at Johnson&#x27;s Ferry. This is where George Washington and a 2,400-man detachment of the Continental Army crossed the river overnight on December 25, 1776, and into the morning of December 26, 1776, to make a surprise attack on Trenton, a move that would prove to be a turning point in the American Revolutionary War. The corresponding ferry on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River was known as McConkey&#x27;s Ferry.

The Johnson Ferry House, an 18th-century farmhouse and tavern near the Delaware River, was owned by Garret Johnson, who operated a plantation and a ferry service across the Delaware. It was likely used by General Washington and other officers at the time of the crossing. Several rooms are furnished with period pieces, and an 18th-century kitchen garden has been planted. On weekends, living-history demonstrations are frequently held.

==Nelson House==
Built , the Nelson House, also known as the Alexander Nelson Tavern, is located near the landing site on the Delaware River and is used for park history demonstrations. The house includes period furnishings and old photographs of railroad and canal transportation.

==Washington Crossing Visitor Center Museum==

The Washington Crossing Visitor Center Museum focuses on the American Revolution and the military campaign known as the &quot;Ten Crucial Days&quot; from December 25, 1776, through January 3, 1777. During this time, the George Washington and the Continental Army crossed the Delaware River, and fought at the Battle of Trenton, the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, and the Battle of Princeton. It features the Harry Kels Swan Collection of Revolutionary War artifacts. Over 700 military items from the American and British Armies are included in the collection. The center also includes interpretive history exhibits that cover the Revolutionary War from its prelude in 1758 to the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

==Nature Center and Observatory==
The Washington Crossing State Park Nature Center offers nature education programs are for schools, youth groups, community organizations, and visitors to the park. The center is open Wednesday through Sunday, year round.

Nearby is the John W. H. Simpson Observatory, which is operated by the Amateur Astronomers Association of Princeton. The observatory houses two telescopes: a 6.25-inch Hastings-Byrne refractor and a 14-inch SCT. The observatory is open for public observing led by association volunteers on Friday nights April through October from 8 to 11 pm, weather permitting.

==Goat Hill Overlook==
Goat Hill Overlook is a scenic preserve administered as part of nearby Washington Crossing State Park. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection&#x27;s Green Acres program purchased the Goat Hill Overlook property in 2009 for $4.5 million from Constructural Dynamics Inc. of Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania. The company acquired Goat Hill Overlook from the Boy Scouts in 1983 and originally intended to use the land for mining operations. That plan was later changed in favor of constructing a residential development complex at the site. In addition to views of the Delaware River, the property features a prominent rock, known as Washington Rock. According to local legend, General Washington used the views from Goat Hill Overlook to assess battle conditions during the Revolutionary War. The site also offers miles of hiking trails and contains a variety of wildlife and plant species.

<text>Days of Future Passed is the second studio album by English progressive rock band the Moody Blues, released on 17 November 1967, by Deram Records. It has been cited by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and others as one of the earliest albums of the progressive rock genre and one of rock music&#x27;s first concept albums.

The album represents a significant creative turning point for the band. The album is their first with guitarist and singer Justin Hayward in place of Denny Laine and bassist John Lodge in place of Clint Warwick. The album is also their first to feature longtime producer and collaborator Tony Clarke and the first to feature keyboardist Mike Pinder on Mellotron. These changes, combined with a shift away from R&amp;B covers toward original compositions and a thematic concept, helped define the band&#x27;s sound for the next several albums and earned the group new critical and commercial success.

The album was recorded to showcase the stereo recording techniques of Decca Records&#x27; new imprint, Deram. The label had requested the group record covers of pop and classical music along with an orchestra. Instead, the album features original compositions expressing the day in a life of an everyday person, interspersed with orchestral interludes arranged and conducted by Peter Knight and performed by the London Festival Orchestra.

The album was a moderate success upon release, but steady FM radio airplay and the success of hit single &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;, caused the album to become a top ten US hit by 1972. It has since been listed among the most important albums of 1967 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

==Background==
The Moody Blues had started out as a rhythm and blues band, and had achieved commercial success in late 1964/early 1965 with the UK No.1 and US Top 10 single &quot;Go Now&quot;, but by late 1966, they had run into financial difficulties and personnel changes, and decided to change creative course. Guitarist Denny Laine and bassist Clint Warwick left the group to pursue other interests, allowing John Lodge, former bandmate and friend of Ray Thomas to join the group on bass. The band would find guitarist and singer Justin Hayward through Eric Burdon of the Animals, who had put out an advert for a new bandmember of his own. Thomas remembers, &quot;He&#x27;d advertised in the local musical press and found somebody. I was having a drink with him in a club, and he said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got a load of replies in my office; if you want to go through them, you&#x27;re more than welcome.&quot;

The addition of Lodge and Hayward brought two additional songwriters into the group, allowing the band to pursue a new creative direction. New singer and guitarist Justin Hayward explains, &quot;We were originally a rhythm-and-blues band, wearing blue suits and singing about people and problems in the Deep South. It was OK, but it was incongruous, getting us nowhere, and, in the end, we had no money, no nothing. When I came into the band as a songwriter in early 1966, Mike was the only one in the band who was writing, and the songs we were writing together were nothing like anything we were doing in our live act. And then, literally one day, we said we&#x27;ve got to do something entirely different. So we decided to write our own material and do only our own songs.&quot; New singer and bassist John Lodge continues, &quot;We hadn&#x27;t been to America. That was the amazing problem because, before we made &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, we were singing songs that originated in America and, having never been there, it seemed like a really strange thing to do – sing about a country or an environment I had no first-hand knowledge of. That&#x27;s why we said, &#x27;OK, let&#x27;s write about English blues. Let&#x27;s write about us.&#x27;&quot;

One particular concert experience gave the band new resolve and drove the band to make a clean break with their past style. Justin Hayward remembers, &quot;We were getting dwindling crowds and decreasing money. It all came to a head when we did a show in Stockton during March 1967. We were so bad, a fan accosted us afterwards and told us we were the worst band he&#x27;d ever seen, and we&#x27;d ruined the night for him and his wife who’d paid £12 for a night out and had seen the dreadful Moody Blues! On the way back in the van, Graeme – who was asleep lying over the equipment at the back – suddenly woke up and said quietly, &#x27;That guy was right. We are rubbish!&#x27; It was the moment we ditched the R&amp;B covers, got rid of our Moody Blues suits and decided to stand or fall by our own songs. What did we have to lose?&quot; Hayward continues, &quot;We had been playing music that wasn&#x27;t suited to our characters. We were lower middle class English boys singing about life in the deep south of the USA and it wasn&#x27;t honest. As soon as we began to express our own feelings and to create our own music our fortunes changed.&quot; &quot;Our audience was suddenly different. People started liking us for the right reasons. There was an honesty about our playing that was completely apparent.&quot;

One prominent element of the group&#x27;s new musical direction was the use of the Mellotron. Lodge remembers, &quot;When we sort of got together in 1966, we were trying to find the right keyboard for Mike. We tried the piano and it wasn&#x27;t really what we wanted in the sound. Then we tried a Hammond organ, a box organ, a Rhodes piano. We tried a Farfisa organ and that didn&#x27;t work and then Mike said, &#x27;You know, I used to work for a company called Mellotron and they invented this machine that sort of simulates strings.&#x27; So we went in search of one.&quot; The Mellotron is a keyboard instrument where each key plays a tape loop of a recording of another instrument, chorus or orchestra. Developed by the West Midlands company Streetly Electronics in the early 1960s, the instrument served as a precursor to sampling keyboards and synthesizers. Mike Pinder, a previous employee of Streetly, used his connections to purchase one of the instruments for the group. Lodge remembers, &quot;There was a social club at one of the factories in Birmingham, called Dunlop – &#x27;Fort Dunlop&#x27; they manufactured tyres – and, they had one of these Mellotrons that no one could play. So we went to see them. I think Mike and I went and spoke to them and we bought it from them. It had never been played. So, Mike set about finding out how to make it work.&quot; Pinder continues, &quot;Les Bradley of Streetly electronics gave me a call and told me that he had found me a suitable instrument at the Dunlop tyre factory social club. I went to see it and I just had to have it. At three hundred pounds, instead of the usual three thousand pounds, the instrument was a steal.&quot; An October 1967 &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; article gives the price of the band&#x27;s Mellotron at £1,300, which was paid for by an air conditioning business millionaire, Derek McCormick.

Though the instrument could prove fickle in concert, Pinder&#x27;s experience allowed him to overcome any challenges. He explains, &quot;I knew how they were built. I knew how to put the Mellotron together and how to take it apart.&quot; Lodge continues, &quot;It was basically tape loops on every note and after every 12 seconds, the notes stopped. So he had to find of way of playing other notes until the spring brought it back to playing mode again. It was all pretty complicated and Mike solved this. The Mellotron had two keyboards. One was for solo playing and the other had all rhythm sections. So, Mike took all the rhythm sections off and duplicated the solo parts, so he could use two sides of the Mellotron as an instrument. That was very clever.&quot; Edge remembers, &quot;Mike figured out to add horns, strings, bagpipes and all that sort of stuff behind it and turn it into a more natural musical instrument.&quot; The instrument&#x27;s ability to reproduce orchestral string sounds in the studio and in concert paired well with Ray Thomas&#x27; flute, which he had recently adopted in place of harmonica. He explains, &quot;I had been playing flute, so it was an ideal marriage for the flute with the strings. We decided to really do it like a classical-rock fusion, I suppose you&#x27;d call it.&quot;

Hayward reflects on the overall impact of the Mellotron on the band&#x27;s music: &quot;Mike and the mellotron made my songs work. That&#x27;s the simplest way I can put it. When he was playing piano it was difficult for me to try and find something that Moody Blues would be percussive on the piano and that would be interesting. And particularly because Mike had already played, you know, the greatest piano single ever, so that was going to be an impossible act to follow. But when he found the mellotron suddenly my songs worked, you know. When I played the other guys &#x27;Nights in White Satin&#x27; they weren&#x27;t that impressed until Mike went on the mellotron and then everyone was kind of interested. (laughs). Because it really started to hang together from the mellotron.&quot; Edge reflects on three distinct developments that drove the band&#x27;s change in sound and creative development: &quot;I think it was three different forces coming together. One was Tony Clarke, the producer. The other was the Mellotron, which Mike Pinder was playing. And the other was Justin Hayward joining the band, because he didn&#x27;t come the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll route, he came the English folk route. So his feel for chord structure was just that little bit different.&quot;

==Writing==
In October 1966, the group relocated to Mouscron, Belgium to write new material and embark on a Belgian tour. Their shows typically consisted of two sets, the first consisting of rhythm and blues covers including &quot;Go Now&quot; and the second consisting of newly written original songs. Lodge says, &quot;We loved playing together. It was really good. It was exciting when it was our own songs, we weren&#x27;t playing a song someone had written for us. So every part of every song we&#x27;d invented ourselves. We wanted to play each part exactly right and new and like no one else had ever played that particular part to a song before. That was exciting about &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, creating something that no one else ever created before. That gave a great feeling.&quot; Lodge continues, &quot;We went to a little village in Mouscron to start writing our own songs and we wrote a lot of songs before &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;. But &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; dictated its own album, really. When we knew what we wanted to do with &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, we dedicated the songwriting to exactly that album. And everything we did before was just left alone.

Graeme Edge remembers, &quot;We designed a stage show which was going to be &#x27;24 hours&#x27;: daylight 12 and night 12, and we had &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Nights&quot; and I think &quot;Peak Hour&quot; all written for that.&quot; Lodge continues, &quot;Ultimately, it was agreed that the record would be a concept album tracking a day in the life of Everyman, with original songs relating to different parts of the day performed in chronological order, introduced and interspersed with orchestral music. Considering that all five members of the group wrote material for the album prior to the concept being established, it&#x27;s remarkable how seamless the execution of it was.&quot; Pinder explains the desire for a cohesive theme, &quot;I had always wanted to create something that was conceptual. I loved the works of Mantovani. I wanted to have our albums on people&#x27;s shelves...albums that people would want to collect, and play in their entirety.&quot;

Keyboardist Mike Pinder wrote &quot;Dawn Is a Feeling&quot; and Hayward wrote &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;, which served as early bookends for the concept. Hayward explains, &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot; had been recorded quite a long time before it was for &quot;Days of Future Passed.&quot; &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot; and &quot;Dawn Is A Feeling&quot; were the two key songs that gave us the idea of the story of a day in the life of one guy, and that&#x27;s what our stage show was about before &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; was mentioned or thought about. So we had those two times of the day and the idea, then it was just a question of grubbing different times of the day to write about; it was quite frivolous, really ... nothing really too serious. I just put my hand up for the afternoon. So I ended up with &quot;Tuesday Afternoon,&quot; and Ray Thomas wrote &quot;Twilight Time.&quot;

Mike Pinder&#x27;s &quot;Dawn is a Feeling&quot; opens the concept with a sense of optimism. Its lyrics acknowledge the spirit of the ongoing Summer of Love and embrace the feeling that society was approaching a new sense of enlightmentment, a new spirituality. Lodge remembers the song as a step in a new direction for the group, and for Pinder&#x27;s songwriting: &quot;I would think it was like an awakening for him as well. He wanted to be a creative writer. Mike wrote fabulous songs. There&#x27;s something special about the morning. And I think that was the dawning of the Moody Blues, really.&quot;

The whimsical &quot;Another Morning&quot; was written by flautist Ray Thomas. Lodge remembers, &quot;He sang me the song. Ray plays flute and harmonica. He doesn&#x27;t play any chordal instruments. And so I remember him singing the song to me. And I remember getting the guitar out and playing it with him in the house. Ray has got this wonderful smiley attitude to life. It&#x27;s a childlike look on life, which is really nice.&quot;

Bassist John Lodge remembers the inspiration for &quot;Peak Hour&quot;: &quot;I wrote &quot;Peak Hour&quot; in the back of a truck. We were coming back from a gig and the rhythm of the wheels on the tarmac were giving a very strong rhythm. I was pounding my foot on the floor and I said to Graeme, &#x27;Could you keep this tempo up for about three minutes? I think I&#x27;ve written a song.&#x27;&quot; He continues, &quot;That&#x27;s where I basically wrote it. I got the main part, the rock and roll part of it, from there. And worked out the bass part. But I really wanted to do something different in the song. That&#x27;s why I broke it into a cathedral choir-type part in the middle. So it could build back up into a rock and roll song. One part of it would go up-tempo and then it stops and becomes really really quiet with the organ sounds and then it starts again rock and roll.&quot;

Hayward recalls writing &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot;: &quot;I was a little hung up with doing tempo changes in the middle of songs. If I got bored, in order to open up another door within the song, I wanted to just go to a different type of mood. In fact, &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; was the first time we did that. I knew by then, by the time I had written &quot;Tuesday Afternoon,&quot; that we were going to do this stage show that was based on a day in the life of one guy, even before we recorded the album. I already had &quot;Nights in White Satin,&quot; and we were already starting to learn that and play it. But there was a gap in this story of the day, so I went down to my parents&#x27; house in the west country, and I had a dog called Tuesday at the time. Not that the dog is in the song, in any way. I smoked a little joint on the side of a field with a guitar, and that song just came out.&quot; He continues, &quot;It was just about searching for some kind of enlightenment or some kind of religious or psychedelic experience in life. I didn&#x27;t really mean it to be taken too seriously, but six months later, there it was: Our first single in America.&quot;

Lodge explains the theme of &quot;(Evening) Time to Get Away&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s really about, if you can achieve something every day, it doesn&#x27;t matter how small it is, it just gives you that energy to carry on and have an enjoyable life. Concerning &quot;The Sun Set&quot; and &quot;Twilight Time&quot;, Lodge remembers, &quot;We were trying to make sure that every song on the album had a different aspect. That was the most important thing. That every song on the album, no one could say, &#x27;Oh, that sounds like that.&#x27;&quot;

Hayward wrote &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; about the changes between one relationship and another, using bedsheets as a metaphor. He remembers the inspiration: &quot;I was the end of one big love affair and at the beginning of another. When you&#x27;re just 20, as I was, that&#x27;s quite important in your life. A girlfriend had given me white satin sheets... It was a lovely romantic gesture, and that&#x27;s what I thought of it. I came home one night after a gig, and sat on the side of the bed, and a lot of these thoughts came out.
I do write letters never meaning to send. I find it a cathartic thing. If I have an issue with somebody or about something, I find it easier to write it down and get it out rather than turning it over in my mind. It&#x27;s a series of random thoughts and ideas from a very stoned 20-year-old young man who was desperately sad for himself over one love affair, and desperately excited by the next.&quot; Hayward continues, &quot;I came back from a gig one night and sat on the side of my bed. I was sharing a flat with Graeme at the time. It was very early, it was almost light. The verses of the songs just came out. I took it into the rehearsal room the next day and I played it to the rest of the group. I got to the end of it and everybody was like, &#x27;Well, it&#x27;s alright.&#x27; Mike Pinder said, &#x27;Play it again.&#x27; I played it again and he played the Mellotron line and suddenly everybody was interested. He put that sort of orchestration to it and suddenly it worked.&quot;

The album opens with the Graeme Edge poem &quot;Morning Glory&quot; and concludes with his &quot;Late Lament&quot;. Edge remembers, &quot;I&#x27;d written both those pieces of verse because the &#x27;Morning&#x27; section appeared rather empty when we first heard it. The latter part of the poem seemed a perfect end to the record. I&#x27;d originally written the words as lyrics for someone else to put some music to, but poetry has a rhythmic structure that makes it difficult to turn into a song, so Tony Clarke suggested recording it as a spoken word piece.&quot; In another interview, he elaborates further, &quot;As musicians, we knew a lot about life after mid-day. But we hadn’t seen that many mornings over the years (laughs). So we were a bit blank. And I set out to write a song that covered the mornings, &quot;Morning Glory,&quot; and as it progressed, I also did an evening part of it, which became &quot;Late Lament,&quot; but I was intending to write the lyrics to a song. I took it in and presented to the boys and said, &#x27;Can anybody put any music to this?&#x27; They all read it and said, &#x27;This is fantastic but there&#x27;s way too many words, you just can&#x27;t sing that. You have to have spaces where they can hold a vowel and sing instead of just talk.&#x27; I went &#x27;Oh yeah, let&#x27;s see, I can cut it down.&#x27; And Tony Clarke said &#x27;No, no, no, that is fantastic. You read it and we&#x27;ll put music behind it, some strings—make it into something,&#x27; which they did. And then they sort of sidled up to me and said, &#x27;You know, it&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s a bit better with Mike&#x27;s voice.&#x27; Like I was going to get upset! I was absolutely thrilled to have something on the album.&quot;

==Recording==
In the summer of 1967, the group made several BBC appearances, debuting &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; and &quot;Peak Hour&quot;. Hearing the final BBC mix of &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; heightened the band&#x27;s excitement for the song and their new material. Hayward remembers, &quot;A long time before we recorded it for Decca, we recorded it for the BBC. We recorded it and weren&#x27;t invited into the control room to listen to it back. And then in our van on the way to a gig we listened to it, because it was on a program called Saturday Club — on a Saturday, of course — and we were going up the motorway and we heard it on the radio. And we pulled the car over, or the van, over to the side of the road, and we said, &#x27;Hey, maybe there&#x27;s something in that song,&#x27; because there was something about it, it sounded really good. We hadn&#x27;t realised until we&#x27;d heard it back ourselves.&quot;

In October, the group were granted studio time to record a demonstration disc for Decca&#x27;s newly formed Deram Records division. The company was eager to demonstrate their latest recording techniques, which were named &quot;Deramic Sound&quot;. Decca had experimented with stereophonic sound for classical recordings, and hoped to capture the pop market in the same way, by interweaving classical recordings with the group&#x27;s interpretation of the same music. Hayward remembers, &quot;They were launching a label called the Deramic Sound System later to become Deram and every recording was in stereo—not just remastered later in stereo, like the Beatles—but actually recorded with a wide stereo sound, everything in its proper stereo place. Stereo then was confined to classical music and they wanted to demonstrate stereo could be as interesting for rock and roll as it was with classical.&quot;

For the demonstration record, Knight and the group were asked to record unoriginal material to demonstrate the new stereo technology, incorporating both orchestral and popular music. Band members remember being asked by the label to record an album incorporating elements of Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 9&quot;. Thomas explains, &quot;They wanted a demonstration disc made for all the salesmen to try and sell Deramic Sound and we could never get any studio time. We were developing &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; as a stage show. They wanted us to play tunes like &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and stuff like that, and wanted Peter Knight and the London Festival Orchestra to play Dvorák&#x27;s New World Symphony. We said that&#x27;s going to sound bloody awful. One minute they&#x27;re listening to &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; and then the next minute to the symphony and us playing someone else.&quot;

Eager to capitalize on the opportunity for studio time, and confident in the quality of their newly written material, the band agreed to the label&#x27;s plan and then quietly decided to record their live set of original songs instead. John Lodge remembers, &quot;The Decca Record company approached us and said they wanted to make what they called a sampler album for their new four-frequency range sound system in stereo, and they wanted to incorporate what they called a &#x27;pop&#x27; band. They wanted us to record Dvorak&#x27;s &#x27;New World Symphony&#x27; and we said, &#x27;Yeah, fantastic!&#x27; But we didn&#x27;t tell them we were going into the studio with the conductor, Peter Knight, and record basically our stage show. That&#x27;s what we did.&quot; Hayward remembers, &quot;We said, yeah, sure we&#x27;d do it, and then, after we said yes, we went down to the pub and decided to do our own songs instead. It was a conspiracy among all us musicians who were present, and we just went into the studio and recorded our own stage show.&quot; Session engineer and longtime studio collaborator Derek Varnals confirms that neither the band nor Knight and the orchestra made any effort to record unoriginal material during the sessions.

Recording sessions for the album took place at Decca Studios in West Hampstead, London beginning with &quot;Dawn Is a Feeling&quot; on 18 October and concluding on the 27th, with mixing complete by 3 November. &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; was recorded prior to the rest of the album, on 8 October. Lodge recalls, &quot;It took all of seven days. So, it took one whole week to record Days of Future Passed.&quot; Thomas remembers, &quot;We were recording one and two songs a day, which we were used to doing. Because you got no time at all in the studio in those days.&quot;

The band worked with record producer Tony Clarke, engineer Derek Varnals, and conductor Peter Knight. Hayward remembers, &quot;We got lucky. We had Decca, who had classically trained engineers, and our stuff was recorded beautifully. The engineer, Derek Varnals, and Tony Clarke had an influence on the way that our songs were presented. If you look at other things we did at the time that weren&#x27;t in the Decca studios, they&#x27;re much more rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and piano based and trying to be a little more up-front and thinking of singles. But all of the stuff that we did in Decca had a particular sound and a particular quality to it that did have that orchestral thing. They knew how to put that together. Decca was a company that was really committed to selling albums, not singles. They had a whole consumer division for stereo systems that they were trying to push. That was a big help to us in the early days because they wanted us to make beautiful stereo records that could demonstrate that stereo could be interesting for rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. It just happened to coincide with us going to America and the birth of FM radio. A lot of things came together.

In a departure from usual practice, the band was able to book the studio during the sessions for entire days at a time, instead of intermittent sessions. The extended sessions facilitated their work, allowing the group to record late into the night. Lodge explains: &quot;At the time, studios [followed a format] of three recording sessions a day. Like 10:00 to 1:00, 2:00 to 5:00 and 6:00 til 10:00. You used to book your sessions, and when they were over you had to leave the studio or wait for the engineers to come back. We knew that if we wanted to make something different, we wanted 24-hour &quot;lockout&quot;. We went to the chairman of the company and said we&#x27;d like a &quot;lockout&quot;. And I don&#x27;t think they had ever had a request for that before, but, fortunately, they agreed. And it was wonderful, because we were recording a tune a day, and as the evening came we&#x27;d relax for a while. Midnight would come and then we&#x27;d start again. As the early hours came – 2:00, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, we realized that was a great time to be constructive and creative. It was great to be able to do that.&quot;

The group recorded and mixed their sessions first, then passed the finished tapes over to Knight for arranging and recording the orchestral interludes. Hayward explains, &quot;It took us five days to finish, and, after each day we&#x27;d send them down to the orchestra&#x27;s conductor, Peter Knight, and he&#x27;d write these orchestral arrangements. We&#x27;d edited all the tapes to be the right length, and they just played live in the gaps.&quot; Pinder recalls, &quot;We were not there when the orchestra parts were done. But we had a wonderful group listening session after they added their contributions. We loved what they had done.&quot;

The orchestral interludes were recorded during a single session on 3 November, and were performed by the London Festival Orchestra conducted by Peter Knight. The orchestra was an ad hoc grouping of professional musicians who served as the house orchestra for Decca Records. Hayward explains, &quot;They were just a bunch of gypsies, what they called string players in London at the time. They were made up from a few different orchestras; they were great players. But the most important thing about that was Peter Knight who orchestrated and arranged the classical parts of the record was in my opinion the greatest romantic string arranger of the era. He was an inspiration to us. His work on the album will stand forever.&quot; The orchestral parts were recorded in a single session. Hayward remembers, &quot;The orchestra was recorded in one three-hour session — a run through and then one take. I was in the studio. I wasn&#x27;t invited in to the control room. Those were the days when the artist was certainly not invited into the control room for an opinion. But I was there at the Peter Knight session, and it was quite wonderful.&quot;

One memorable moment was the recording of the background vocals on &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;. Thomas remembers, &quot;When we did &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;, the four of us got &#x27;round a mic and sang in harmony. And then Tony said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s do another take.&#x27; He was doubling it up! When I heard the playback, it was like a mini choir. There were a few tears shed.&quot; Lodge remembers recording the song so that each element, each instrument had its own space: &quot;We said we&#x27;ve got to make it where in parts of the song, except for Justin&#x27;s vocal, you can hear a pin drop. It was really important so that the bass had its own space and the acoustic guitar had its own space in the verses, nothing else was playing. So that when the Mellotron came in, you heard the dimension.&quot; The band were pleased with the results. Drummer Edge remembers, &quot;When we recorded the song for Decca we all felt we had created something marvelous. It was quite an emotional experience to hear the finished mix of the song for the first time.&quot; He continues and compares the moment to &quot;Fairy dust. The invisible, unknowable thing. It&#x27;s just one of those songs where everything came together correctly.&quot;

The group held a playback session attended by the group, Decca executives and various associates in a dimly lit recording studio. Lodge remembers the moment: &quot;After the playback session finished and the studio lights came on once more the smiles on our faces said it all. We knew we had been right to stick to our principles and record our own music.&quot; The Moody Blues did not play any of the music to Decca executives until it was complete. Upon the first play, they were disappointed with the result as it was not the Dvorak arrangements they expected. Walt Maguire, representative for London Records (Decca&#x27;s North American arm), however, thought it would be a strong seller in the US, so it was agreed to release the album as recorded. Hayward remembers, &quot;When we played the finished product to all these old directors at Decca, which is a fine, upstanding old English music firm, they said, &#x27;This isn&#x27;t Dvorak,&#x27; and we said, &#x27;No, but this is what it is.&#x27; We had one ally there, and he really stood up for us; he said, &#x27;I think it could be quite interesting,&#x27; and besides, we had made a stereo demonstration record--it just wasn&#x27;t Dvorak. So eventually we got enough of them to believe in it to put it out, and it was an instant hit.&quot;

==Album cover==
The album cover was designed by David Anstey and was commissioned for the album. Hayward remembers, &quot;He was just thrown this idea, and we met him in a pub and told him about our songs, and he knocked that out, and they used it. It was reduced in scale from David Anstey’s original picture.&quot; The cover features a painted collage of various time-related images inspired by the album&#x27;s songs, including an hourglass, a sunset, moon phases and mounted knights.

==Release==
&quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; was released on 17 November 1967 in the UK (delayed from a 3 November 1967 announcement), and arrived in the US in March 1968. It reached number 27 in the UK Albums Chart. In the US, it was a steady seller in the late 1960s, helped by FM radio play of &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;, and eventually peaked at number 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in 1972.

The U.S. mono version (Deram DE-16012) was pressed in a limited quantity as it was released during the &quot;phase-out&quot; of mono LP releases by the major record companies, thus it is an often-sought item amongst record collectors.

&quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; was issued as a discrete Quadraphonic open-reel tape in 1977. This master was also used for a 2001 dts 5.1 channel audio CD release and again for a two-disc Deluxe Edition SACD release in 2006.

On 17 November 2017 this original mix was made available for the first time on CD as &quot;Days of Future Passed 50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition&quot;. Also released &quot;The Moody Blues Days of Future Past Live&quot; that was recorded live in Toronto on 13 July 2017 with a full orchestra backup.

==Reception==

Upon its release, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album an unenthusiastic review, writing &quot;The Moody Blues [...] have matured considerably since &#x27;Go Now&#x27;, but their music is constantly marred by one of the most startlingly saccharine conceptions of &#x27;beauty&#x27; and &#x27;mysticism&#x27; that any rock group has ever affected.&quot; &quot;New York&quot; magazine dismissed it as &quot;a ponderous mound of thought-jello.&quot; However, the album has since received acclaim; for example, &quot;Spin&quot; cited it as a classic of progressive rock. By 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; — which had originally described &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; as &quot;an English rock group strangling itself in conceptual goo&quot; — included it in its list of the essential albums of 1967.

Music writers cite the album as an early example of progressive rock music. Bill Holdship of Yahoo! Music remarks that the band &quot;created an entire genre here.&quot; David Fricke cites it as one of the essential albums of 1967 and finds it &quot;closer to high-art pomp than psychedelia. But there is a sharp pop discretion to the writing and a trippy romanticism in the mirroring effect of the strings and Mike Pinder&#x27;s Mellotron.&quot; Will Hermes cites the album as an essential progressive rock record and opines that its use of the Mellotron, a tape replay keyboard, made it a &quot;signature&quot; element of the genre. An influential work of the counterculture period, AllMusic editor Bruce Eder calls the album &quot;one of the defining documents of the blossoming psychedelic era, and one of the most enduringly popular albums of its era&quot;.

== Original and later mixes ==
In July 1978, it was discovered that the UK master tapes for &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; had deteriorated. As a result of this, the album was remixed in its entirety in August 1978, which was used for reissues between 1978 and 2017. Some compilations, however, continued to use the original 1967 stereo mix for certain songs. The album&#x27;s original mix was eventually released in its entirety on compact disc in November 2017.

The ways in which the later mix departs most noticeably from the original are:
* After the orchestral intro, &quot;Dawn Is a Feeling&quot; begins more abruptly, and there is less echo on Mike Pinder&#x27;s vocal on the bridge, making it more prominent.
* On &quot;Another Morning&quot; Ray Thomas&#x27;s double vocals are spread left and right in the stereo channel. The flute interlude is also played twice towards the end of the song before the orchestral segue.
* The orchestral intro &quot;Lunch Break&quot; goes on about 15 seconds longer before fading out.
* The bridges to &quot;(Evening) Time to Get Away&quot; have John Lodge singing alone; all the backing vocals on that part have been lost.
* The end of &quot;(Evening) Time to Get Away&quot; is missing a Mellotron part and only repeats twice, instead of three times.
* &quot;The Sun Set&quot; is missing some piano parts, percussion parts, and the reverb on &quot;through the night&quot; is different.
* &quot;Twilight Time&quot; begins more abruptly after the orchestral interlude.
* The backing vocals on &quot;Twilight Time&quot; are heard through the entire song instead of only coming in at certain points.
* At the beginning of &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;, as the orchestral prelude ends, there is one less beat of time before the rhythm section starts in.
* Some of the strings near the end of &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; (before &quot;Late Lament&quot;) are out of sync with the main body of the song.

<text>Adrianus Dingeman (Adriaan) de Groot (Santpoort, 26 October 1914 – Schiermonnikoog, 14 August 2006) was a Dutch chess master and psychologist, who conducted some of the most famous chess experiments of all time in the 1940s-60. In 1946 he wrote his thesis &quot;Het denken van den schaker&quot;, which in 1965 was translated into English and published as &quot;Thought and choice in chess&quot;. De Groot played for the Netherlands in the Chess Olympiads of 1937 and 1939. In 1973 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Study of chess players==
The studies involve participants of all chess backgrounds, from amateurs to masters. They investigate the cognitive requirements and the thought processes involved in moving a chess piece. The participants were usually required to solve a given chess problem correctly under the supervision of an experimenter and represent their thought-processes vocally so that they could be recorded.

De Groot found that much of what is important in choosing a move occurs during the first few seconds of exposure to a new position. Four stages in the task of choosing the next move were noted. The first stage was the &#x27;orientation phase&#x27;, in which the subject assessed the situation and determined a very general idea of what to do next. The second stage, the &#x27;exploration phase&#x27; was manifested by looking at some branches of the game tree. The third stage, or &#x27;investigation phase&#x27; resulted in the subject choosing a probable best move. Finally, in the fourth stage, the &#x27;proof phase&#x27;, saw the subject confirming with him/herself that the results of the investigation were valid.

De Groot concurred with Alfred Binet that visual memory and visual perception are important attributors and that problem-solving ability is of paramount importance. Memory is particularly important, according to de Groot (1965), in that there are no ‘new’ moves in chess, so those from personal experience (or from the experience of others) can be committed to memory.

<text>Free climbing is a form of rock climbing in which the climber can only use climbing equipment for climbing protection but not as an artificial aid to help them in ascending the route. Free climbing, therefore, cannot use any of the tools that are used in aid climbing to help overcome the obstacles encountered while ascending a route. The development of free climbing was an important moment in the history of rock climbing, including the concept and definition of what determined a first free ascent (or FFA) of a route by a climber.

Free climbing can be performed in several rock-climbing formats that vary with the type of climbing protection that is used. Thus, free climbing can be done as traditional climbing (which only uses temporary removable climbing protection), sport climbing (which only uses permanently fixed in-situ climbing protection), and bouldering and free solo climbing (both use no climbing protection whatsoever). Free climbing is sometimes mis-understood as only relating to the format of free-solo climbing or solo climbing, which is not correct.

==History==

The free climbing movement was an important development in the history of rock climbing. In 1911, Austrian climber Paul Preuss started what became known as the &quot;Mauerhakenstreit&quot; (or &quot;piton dispute&quot;), by advocating for a transition to &quot;free climbing&quot; via a series of essays and articles in the &quot;German Alpine Journal&quot; where he defined &quot;artificial aid&quot; and proposed 6 rules of free climbing including the important rule 4: &quot;The piton is an emergency aid and not the basis of a system of mountaineering&quot;. In 1913, German climber Rudolf Fehrmann published the second edition of &quot;Der Bergsteiger in der Sächsischen Schweiz&quot; (or &quot;The Climber in Saxon Switzerland&quot;), which included the first binding rules for climbing in the area to protect the soft sandstone rock. The rules said that only natural holds were allowed, and these &quot;rules for free climbing&quot; are in still use today.

In 1975, German climber Kurt Albert painted his first &quot;Rotpunkt&quot; (or redpoint) on the base of the aid climb &quot;Adolf Rott Ged.-Weg&quot; (V+/A1), in the Frankenjura, signifying he had &quot;free climbed&quot; it as a redpoint (i.e. after many failed attempts); the redpoint became the accepted definition of what constituted a &quot;first free ascent&quot;.

===First free ascent===

The first &quot;free climb&quot; of a climbing route is known as the first free ascent, or FFA, and is chronicled by climbing journals and guide books. They also chronicle whether the &quot;free climb&quot; was done onsight (i.e. first try without any prior information), flashed (i.e. first try with prior information), or redpointed (i.e. completed after a first failed attempt). FFAs that create new grade milestones are important events in climbing history.

===French free climbing===

The derived term French free climbing, refers to the French lead climbing technique of &quot;pulling upward&quot; on pieces of in-situ climbing protection equipment (e.g. quickdraws on bolted routes or SLCDs on traditional climbing routes), as a source of aid in ascending the climbing route. It is equivalent to an A0-graded aid climbing technique and is typically used on longer big wall climbing or alpine climbing routes where it is important that the climber(s) progress efficiently and not get overly delayed on a specific section.

Despite the name, &#x27;French free climbing&#x27; is not considered &#x27;free climbing&#x27; per se, and a climber that uses the technique could not claim a &#x27;first free ascent&#x27; of a new route.

==Types==

Free climbing means using no form of artificial or mechanical aid to help progression in ascending a route. Even the act of pulling on the climbing protection equipment as employed in &#x27;French free climbing&#x27; (either placed by the climber while climbing or already in situ with pre-placed bolts) is considered aid climbing and carries an aid climbing grade of A0.

Free climbing can be performed in a variety of types of climbing, and most importantly:

* Traditional climbing, where temporary climbing protection equipment is used, and placed by the climber as they ascend the route, but which is not for any form of artificial aid in upward progression on the climbing route.
* Sport climbing, where pre-placed fixed bolts are used for climbing protection, but again, not for any form of aid in upward progression on the climbing route.
* Bouldering, as no forms of mechanical devices are employed in bouldering (not even for protection), it is by definition, free climbing.
* Free solo climbing, as with bouldering, as no forms of mechanical devices are employed in free solo climbing, it is by definition, free climbing.

==Misunderstandings==

Free climbing has been called &quot;rock climbing&#x27;s most commonly mistaken term&quot;, with problems including:

* Incorrectly assuming that &quot;free climbing&quot; always means solo climbing, i.e. that you must always be alone and without any partner. Free climbing in traditional climbing and sport climbing uses a supporting belayer.
* Incorrectly assuming that &quot;free climbing&quot; always means free soloing, i.e. that you must never use any climbing protection equipment. Free climbing in traditional climbing and sport climbing uses climbing protection (but not to aid progression).
* Incorrectly assuming that &quot;free climbing&quot; always means onsighting or flashing, i.e. that you must always climb the route first try. Free climbing in traditional climbing and sport climbing also uses the &#x27;redpoint&#x27; as a definition of a first free ascent.

Free climbing is related to — but separate from — the broader climbing topic area of clean climbing; however, clean climbing does not support the use of bolted sport climbing routes on external natural rock, and thus redpointed first free ascents on bolted routes are not advocated.

<text>Charles Martin Hall (December 6, 1863 – December 27, 1914) was an American inventor, businessman, and chemist. He is best known for his invention in 1886 of an inexpensive method for producing aluminium, which became the first metal to attain widespread use since the prehistoric discovery of iron. He was one of the founders of Alcoa, along with Alfred E. Hunt; Hunt&#x27;s partner at the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory, George Hubbard Clapp; Hunt&#x27;s chief chemist, W. S. Sample; Howard Lash, head of the Carbon Steel Company; Millard Hunsiker, sales manager for the Carbon Steel Company; and Robert Scott, a mill superintendent for the Carnegie Steel Company. Together they raised $20,000 to launch the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which was later renamed Aluminum Company of America and then shortened to Alcoa.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Charles Martin Hall was born to Herman Bassett Hall and Sophronia H. Brooks on December 6, 1863, in Thompson, Ohio. Charles&#x27;s father, Herman, graduated from Oberlin College in 1847, and studied for three years at the Oberlin Theological Seminary, where he met his future wife, Sophronia Brooks. They married in 1849, and the next ten years were spent in missionary work in Jamaica, where the first five of their eight children were born. They returned to Ohio in 1860, after the outbreak of the Civil War forced the closing of foreign missions. Charles Hall had two brothers and five sisters; one brother died in infancy. One of his sisters was chemist Julia Brainerd Hall (1859–1925), who helped him in his research.

Hall began his education at home, and he was taught to read at an early age by his mother. At the age of six, he was using his father&#x27;s 1840s college chemistry book as a reader. At age 8, he entered public school, and progressed rapidly.

Hall&#x27;s family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, in 1873. He spent three years at Oberlin High School, and a year at Oberlin Academy in preparation for college. During this time, he demonstrated his aptitude for chemistry and invention, carrying out experiments in the kitchen and the woodshed attached to his house. In 1880, at the age of 16, he enrolled at Oberlin College.

In his second term, Hall attended, with considerable interest, Oberlin Professor Frank Fanning Jewett&#x27;s lecture on aluminum; it was here that Jewett displayed the sample of aluminum he had obtained from Friedrich Wöhler at Göttingen, and remarked, &quot;if anyone should invent a process by which aluminum could be made on a commercial scale, not only would he be a benefactor to the world, but would also be able to lay up for himself a great fortune&quot;.

===Discovery===
Hall&#x27;s initial experiments in finding an aluminum reduction process were in 1881. He attempted, unsuccessfully, to produce aluminum from clay by smelting with carbon in contact with charcoal and potassium chlorate. He next attempted to improve the electrolytic methods previously established by investigating cheaper methods to produce aluminum chloride, again unsuccessfully. In his senior year, he attempted to electrolyze aluminum fluoride in water, but was unable to produce aluminum at the cathode.

In 1884, after setting up a homemade coal-fired furnace and bellows in a shed behind the family home, Hall again tried to find a catalyst that would allow him to reduce aluminum with carbon at high temperatures: &quot;I tried mixtures of alumina and carbon with barium salts, with cryolite, and with carbonate of sodium, hoping to get a double reaction by which the final result would be aluminum. I remember buying some metallic sodium and trying to reduce cryolite, but obtained very poor results. I made some aluminum sulphide but found it very unpromising as a source of aluminum then as it has been ever since&quot;.

Hall had to fabricate most of his apparatus and prepare his chemicals, and was assisted by his older sister Julia Brainerd Hall. The basic invention, which he discovered on February 23, 1886, involves passing an electric current through a bath of alumina dissolved in cryolite, which results in a puddle of aluminum forming in the bottom of the retort. On July 9, 1886, Hall filed for his first patent. This process was also discovered at nearly the same time by the Frenchman Paul Héroult, and it has come to be known as the Hall–Héroult process.

After failing to find financial backing at home, Hall went to Pittsburgh, where he made contact with noted metallurgist Alfred E. Hunt. They formed the Reduction Company of Pittsburgh, which opened the first large-scale aluminum production plants. The Reduction Company later became the Aluminum Company of America, then Alcoa. Hall was a major stockholder, and became wealthy.

The Hall–Héroult process eventually resulted in reducing the price of aluminum by a factor of 200, making it affordable for many practical uses. By 1900, annual production reached about . Today, more aluminum is produced than all other non-ferrous metals combined.

Hall is sometimes suggested to be the originator of the American spelling of &quot;aluminum&quot;, but that spelling was used briefly by Humphry Davy in the early 1800s and was the spelling in Noah Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of 1828. &quot;Aluminium&quot; was used widely in the United States until 1895 or 1900, and &quot;aluminum&quot; was not officially adopted by the American Chemical Society until 1925. Hall&#x27;s early patents use the spelling &quot;aluminium&quot;. In the United Kingdom and other countries using British spelling, only the spelling &quot;aluminium&quot; is now used. The spelling in virtually all other languages is analogous to the &quot;-ium&quot; ending.

===Later years and death===
Hall continued his research and development for the rest of his life and was granted 22 US patents, most on aluminum production. He served on the Oberlin College Board of Trustees. He retained powerful influence over the business decisions at Alcoa until his death.

Hall died, unmarried and childless, on December 27, 1914, twenty-one days after he had reached the age of 51, in Daytona, Florida. He was buried in Westwood Cemetery in Oberlin. He died the same year as Héroult, and they both were born the same year.

In his last will and testament, Hall left the vast majority of his fortune to charity. His generosity contributed to the establishment of the Harvard–Yenching Institute, a leading foundation dedicated to advancing higher education in Asia in the humanities and social sciences.

==Awards and honors==
Hall was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1898. He won the Perkin Medal, the highest award that the American section of the Society of Chemical Industry bestows, in 1911. In 1997, the production of aluminum by electrochemistry discovered by Hall was designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society.

Hall eventually became one of Oberlin College&#x27;s most prominent benefactors, and an aluminum statue of him exists on the campus. Because of its light weight, Hall&#x27;s statue was once known for its frequent changes of location, often due to student pranks. Today the statue is glued to a large granite block and sits more permanently on the second floor of Oberlin&#x27;s science center, where students continue to decorate Hall with appropriate trappings on holidays and other occasions.

The Jewett home is preserved in Oberlin as the Oberlin Heritage Center. The center features an exhibit called &quot;Aluminum: The Oberlin Connection&quot;, which includes a re-creation of Hall&#x27;s 1886 woodshed experiment. The Hall House is also preserved in Oberlin, although the woodshed was demolished long ago.

<text>In computing, a line number is a method used to specify a particular sequence of characters in a text file. The most common method of assigning numbers to lines is to assign every line a unique number, starting at 1 for the first line, and incrementing by 1 for each successive line.

In the C programming language the line number of a source code line is one greater than the number of new-line characters read or introduced up to that point.

Programmers could also assign line numbers to statements in older programming languages, such as Fortran, JOSS, and BASIC. In Fortran, not every statement needed a line number, and line numbers did not have to be in sequential order. The purpose of line numbers was for branching and for reference by formatting statements.

Both JOSS and BASIC made line numbers a required element of syntax. The primary reason for this is that most operating systems at the time lacked interactive text editors; since the programmer&#x27;s interface was usually limited to a line editor, line numbers provided a mechanism by which specific lines in the source code could be referenced for editing, and by which the programmer could insert a new line at a specific point. Line numbers also provided a convenient means of distinguishing between code to be entered into the program and direct mode commands to be executed immediately when entered by the user (which do not have line numbers).

Largely due to the prevalence of interactive text editing in modern operating systems, line numbers are not a feature of most programming languages, even modern Fortran and Basic.

==History==
===FORTRAN===
In Fortran, as first specified in 1956, line numbers were used to define input/output patterns, to specify statements to be repeated, and for conditional branching. For example:
 DIMENSION ALPHA(25), RHO(25)
1) FORMAT(5F12.4)
2) READ 1, ALPHA, RHO, ARG
 SUM = 0.0
 DO 3 I=1, 25
 IF (ARG-ALPHA(I)) 4,3,3
3) SUM = SUM + ALPHA(I)
4) VALUE = 3.14159*RHO(I-1)
 PRINT 1, ARG, SUM, VALUE
 GO TO 2
Like assembler language before it, Fortran did not assume every line needed a label (line number, in this case). Only statements referenced elsewhere required a line number:
* Line 1 specifies a format pattern for input; the command in line 2 and the later command both reference this line.
* The loop executes line 3.
* The arithmetic IF statement branches to line 4 on a negative value, line 3 on zero, and again line 3 on a positive value.

While the line numbers are sequential in this example, in the very first &quot;complete but simple [Fortran] program&quot; published the line numbers are in the sequence 1, 5, 30, 10, 20, 2.

Line numbers could also be assigned to fixed-point variables (e.g., &quot;i&quot; &quot;n&quot;) for referencing in subsequent assigned GO TO statements (e.g., &quot;n,(n1,n2...nm)&quot;).

===COBOL===

In COBOL, line numbers were specified in the first six characters (the &quot;sequence number area&quot;) of punched cards. This was originally used for facilitating mechanical card sorting to assure intended program code sequence after manual handling. The line numbers were actually ignored by the compiler.

===DOPE===

In 1962, DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment) became one of the first programming languages to require a line number for every statement and to use sequential ordering of line numbers. Line numbers were specified as destinations for two commands, C (Compare operation, an arithmetic IF) and T (To operation, a GO TO).

===JOSS===

In 1963, JOSS independently made line numbers mandatory for every statement in a program and ordered lines in sequential order. JOSS introduced the idea of a single command line editor that worked both as an interactive language and a program editor. Commands that were typed without a line number were executed immediately, in what JOSS referred to as &quot;direct mode&quot;. If the same line was prefixed with a line number, it was instead copied into the program code storage area, which JOSS called &quot;indirect mode&quot;.

Unlike FORTRAN before it or BASIC after it, JOSS required line numbers to be fixed-point numbers consisting of a pair of two-digit integers separated by a period (e.g., 1.1). The portion of the line number to the left of the period is known as the &quot;page&quot; or &quot;part&quot;, while the portion to the right is known as the &quot;line&quot;; for example, the line number refers to page 10, line 12. Branches can target either a page or a line within a page. When the later format is used, the combined page and line is known as a &quot;step&quot;.

Pages are used to define subroutines, which return when the next line is on a different page. For instance, if a subroutine for calculating the square root of a number is in page 3, one might have three lines of code 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, and it would be called using The code would return to the statement after the Do when it reaches the next line on a different page, for instance, 4.1. There is no need for the equivalent of a at the end, although if an early return is required, accomplishes this. Example:
 *Routine to ask the user for a positive value and repeat until it gets one
 01.10 Demand X as &quot;Enter a positive value greater than zero&quot;.
 01.20 Done if X&gt;0.
 01.30 To step 1.1

=== BASIC ===
Introduced in 1964, Dartmouth BASIC adopted mandatory line numbers, as in JOSS, but made them integers, as in FORTRAN. As defined initially, BASIC only used line numbers for and (go to subroutine, then return). Some Tiny BASIC implementations supported numeric expressions instead of constants, while switch statements were present in different dialects ( ; ; ).

Line numbers were rarely used elsewhere. One exception was allowing the pointer used by (which iterated through statements) to be set to a specific line number using .
 1 REM RESTORE COULD BE USED IF A BASIC LACKED STRING ARRAYS
 2 DIM M$(9): REM DEFINE LENGTH OF 9 CHARACTERS
 5 INPUT &quot;MONTH #?&quot;; M: IF M&lt;1 OR M&gt;12 THEN 5
 7 RESTORE 10*M: READ M$: PRINT M$
 10 DATA &quot;JANUARY&quot;
 20 DATA &quot;FEBRUARY&quot;
 30 DATA &quot;MARCH&quot;


In the first editions of Dartmouth BASIC, could only be followed by a line number (for an &quot;implied GOTO&quot;), not - as in later implementations - by a statement.

The range of valid line numbers varied widely from implementation to implementation, depending on the representation used to store the binary equivalent of the line number (one or two bytes; signed or unsigned). While Dartmouth BASIC supported 1 to 99999, the typical microcomputer implementation supported 1 to 32767 (a signed 16-bit word).
1) While QBASIC does make use of structured programming and thus doesn&#x27;t need line numbers, it is still possible to run code with line numbers in QBASIC.

==Line numbers and style==
It was a matter of programming style, if not outright necessity, in these languages to leave gaps between successive line numbers—i.e., a programmer would use the sequence (10, 20, 30, ...) rather than (1, 2, 3, ...). This permitted the programmer to insert a line of code at a later time. For example, if a line of code between lines 20 and 30 was left out, the programmer might insert the forgotten line at line number 25. If no gaps were left in the numbering, the programmer would be required to renumber line 3 and all subsequent lines in order to insert the new line after line 2. Of course, if the programmer needed to insert more than nine additional lines, renumbering would be required even with the sparser numbering. However, this renumbering would be limited to renumbering only 1 line per ten lines added; when the programmer finds they need to add a line between 29 and 30, only line 30 would need to be renumbered and line 40 could be left unchanged.

Some BASICs had a command, which typically would go through the program (or a specified portion of it), reassigning line numbers in equal increments. It would also renumber all references to those line numbers so they would continue to work properly.

In a large program containing subroutines, each subroutine would usually start at a line number sufficiently large to leave room for expansion of the main program (and previous subroutines). For example, subroutines might begin at lines 10000, 20000, 30000, etc.

==Line numbers and GOTOs==
In &quot;unstructured&quot; programming languages such as BASIC, line numbers were used to specify the targets of branching statements. For example:
1 S=0: N=-1
2 INPUT &quot;ENTER A NUMBER TO ADD, OR 0 TO END&quot;; I
3 S=S+I: N=N+1: IF I&lt;&gt;0 THEN GOTO 2
4 PRINT &quot;SUM=&quot;; S: PRINT &quot;AVERAGE=&quot;; S/N
GOTO-style branching can lead to the development of spaghetti code. (See Considered harmful, Structured programming.) Even in some later versions of BASIC that still mandated line numbers, the use of line number-controlled GOTOs was phased out whenever possible in favor of cleaner constructs such as the for loop and while loop.

Many modern languages (including C and C++) include a version of the GOTO statement; however, in these languages the target of a GOTO is specified by a line label instead of a line number.

==Line numbers and syntax errors==
If a programmer introduces a syntax error into a program, the compiler (or interpreter) will inform the programmer that the attempt to compile (or execute) failed at the given line number. This simplifies the job of finding the error immensely for the programmer.

The use of line numbers to describe the location of errors remains standard in modern programming tools, even though line numbers are never required to be manually specified. It is a simple matter for a program to count the newlines in a source file and display an automatically generated line number as the location of the error. In IDEs such as Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse or Xcode, in which the compiler is usually integrated with the text editor, the programmer can even double-click on an error and be taken directly to the line containing that error.

<doc id="585538" wikidata="Q1773152" url="?curid=585538" title="Public participation (decision making)">
<text>Citizen participation or public participation in social science refers to different mechanisms for the public to express opinions—and ideally exert influence—regarding political, economic, management or other social decisions. Participatory decision-making can take place along any realm of human social activity, including economic (i.e. participatory economics), political (i.e. participatory democracy or parpolity), management (i.e. participatory management), cultural (i.e. polyculturalism) or familial (i.e. feminism).

For well-informed participation to occur, it is argued that some version of transparency, e.g. radical transparency, is necessary but not sufficient. It has also been argued that those most affected by a decision should have the most say while those that are least affected should have the least say in a topic.

== Classifying participation ==

Sherry Arnstein discusses eight types of participation in &quot;A Ladder of Citizen Participation&quot; (1969). Often termed as &quot;Arnstein&#x27;s ladder of citizen participation &quot;, these are broadly categorized as:
* Citizen Power: Citizen Control, Delegated Power, Partnership.
*Tokenism: Placation, Consultation, Informing.
*Non-participation: Therapy, Manipulation.
She defines citizen participation as the redistribution of power that enables the have-not citizens, presently excluded from the political and economic processes, to be deliberately included in the future.

Robert Silverman expanded on Arnstein&#x27;s ladder of citizen participation with the introduction of his &quot;citizen participation continuum.&quot; In this extension to Arstein&#x27;s work he takes the groups that drive participation into consideration and the forms of participation they pursue. Consequently, Silverman&#x27;s continuum distinguishes between grassroots participation and instrumental participation.

Archon Fung presents another classification of participation based on three key questions: Who is allowed to participate, and are they representative of the population? What is the method of communication or decision-making? And how much influence or authority is granted to the participation?

Other &quot;ladders&quot; of participation have been presented by D.M. Connor,
Wiedemann and Femers,
A. Dorcey et al., Jules N. Pretty
and E.M. Rocha.

The International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) has developed a &#x27;spectrum of public participation&#x27; based on five levels: information, consultation, involvement, collaboration and empowerment.

== Specific participation activities ==
*Town hall meeting
*Advisory committee
*Citizens&#x27; assembly
*Opinion poll
*Participatory design
*Participatory budgeting
*Referendum
*Protest
*Vote

== Corporate participation ==
Participation in the corporate sector has been studied as a way to improve business related processes starting from productivity to employee satisfaction.

== Cross cultural objective participation ==
A cultural variation of participation can be seen through the actions of &quot;Indigenous American Cultures&quot;. Participation draws from two aspects: respect and commitment to their community and family. The respect is seen through their participation in non-obligated participation in various aspects of their lives, ranging from housework to fieldwork.

Often the participation in these communities is a social interaction occurring as a progression for the community, rather than that of the individual. Participation in these communities can serve as a &quot;learning service&quot;. This learning ranges from everyday activities, in which community members gain a new skill to complete a task or participate through social events to keep their cultural practices alive. These social participation events allow newer generations to see the events and learn from this ongoing participation to continue these practices. Although there are different domains and objectives of participation in these communities, the bottom line to this participation is that it is non obligated and often community orientated.

A social interaction that continues to thrive because of this high level of non-obligation is the everyday action of &quot;translating&quot;.

== Objectives of participation ==
Participation activities may be motivated from an administrative perspective or a citizen perspective on a governmental, corporate or social level. From the administrative viewpoint, participation can build public support for activities. It can educate the public about an agency&#x27;s activities. It can also facilitate useful information exchange regarding local conditions. Furthermore, participation is often legally mandated. From the citizen viewpoint, participation enables individuals and groups to influence agency decisions in a representational manner. The different types of political participation depends on the motivation. When a group is determined to work to solve a community problem, there can be led marches to work for candidates. Most immigrant racial groups have higher motivation since there is an increase in geographical dispersion and are faster growing racial groups. How well participation can influence the relation between citizen and their local government, how it increases trust and boosts peoples willingness to participate Giovanni Allegretti explains in an interview using the example of participatory budgeting.

== Participatory decision-making in science ==
Public participation in decision-making has been studied as a way to align value judgements and risk trade-offs with public values and attitudes about acceptable risk. This research is of interest for emerging areas of science, including controversial technologies and new applications.

In the United States, studies have demonstrated public support for increased participation in science. While public trust in scientists remains generally high in the United States, the public may rate scientists&#x27; ability to make decisions on behalf of society less highly. For example, a 2016–2017 survey of public opinion on CRISPR gene editing technology showed a &quot;relatively broad consensus among all groups in support of the idea that the scientific community &#x27;should consult with the public before applying gene editing to humans,&#x27;&quot; providing a &quot;broad mandate for public engagement.&quot;

The scientific community has struggled to involve the public in scientific decision-making. Abuses of scientific research participants, including well-known examples like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, may continue to erode trust in scientists among vulnerable populations.

Additionally, past efforts to come to scientific consensus on controversial issues have excluded the public, and as a result narrowed the scope of technological risks considered. For example, at the 1975 Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA, scientists addressed the risks of biological contamination during laboratory experiments, but failed to consider the more varied public concerns that would surface with commercial adoption of genetically modified crops.
Researchers acknowledge that further infrastructure and investment is needed to facilitate effective participatory decision-making in science. A five-part approach has been suggested:

* Support effective science communication and engagement
* Capitalize on the strength of diverse coalitions
* Build capacity to deal with moving targets
* Focus on shared values
* Build trusting relationships through applied research and feedback loops

== Participation in Heritage ==
Communities can be involved in local, regional and national cultural heritage initiatives, in the processes of creation, organisation, access, use and preservation. The internet has facilitated this, particularly via crowdsourcing, where the general public is asked to help contribute to shared goals, creating content, but also as a form of mutually beneficial engagement particularly with the collections and research of Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (GLAM). An example of this is the Transcribe Bentham project, where volunteers are asked to transcribe the manuscripts of the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Challenges include: how to manage copyright, ownership, orphan works, access to open data from heritage organisations, how to build relationships with cultural heritage amateurs, sustainable preservation, and attitudes towards openness.

== Critiques of participation ==
Efforts to promote public participation have been widely critiqued. There is particular concern regarding the potential capture of the public into the sphere of influence of governance stakeholders, leaving communities frustrated by public participation initiatives, marginalized and ignored.

== Civic opportunity gap ==
Youth participation in civic activities has been found to be linked to a student&#x27;s race, academic track, and their school&#x27;s socioeconomic status. The American Political Science Task Force on Inequality and American Democracy has found that those with higher socioeconomic status participate at higher rates than those with lower status. A collection of surveys on student participation in 2008 found that &quot;Students who are more academically successful or white and those with parents of higher socioeconomic status receive more classroom-based civic learning opportunities.&quot; Youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to report participation in school-based service or service-learning than other students. Students with more highly educated parents and higher household incomes are more likely to have the opportunity to participate in student government, give a speech, or develop debating skills in school.

<doc id="585553" wikidata="Q268739" url="?curid=585553" title="Hall of the Mountain King (album)">
<text>Hall of the Mountain King is the fourth studio album by the American heavy metal band Savatage, released in 1987 under the direction of producer Paul O&#x27;Neill. It is their first album produced by O&#x27;Neill, who was assigned to the band after the tour in support of &quot;Fight for the Rock&quot;. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s influence pushed Savatage to adopt a conceptual style beginning with this album.

&quot;Prelude to Madness&quot; is an arrangement of Grieg&#x27;s &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; from the &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; suite. Oddly, Grieg is not credited for this song, but for the following title track - which is an original song. The intro of &quot;Prelude to Madness&quot; features keyboards and guitar playing &quot;Mars, the Bringer of War&quot; from Gustav Holst&#x27;s suite, &quot;The Planets&quot;. The song would be re-recorded by Trans-Siberian Orchestra in 2009 under the title of &quot;The Mountain&quot;, appearing on that group&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Night Castle&quot;.

&quot;This Is Where You Should Be&quot;, recorded during the studio sessions for this album, was not included; years later it was released on compilations and album reissues.

This was the first album to feature the album cover drawn by artist Gary Smith, who was responsible for lead guitarist Criss Oliva&#x27;s airbrushed guitars at the time. &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot; reached position No. 116 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart.

In 2017 and 2019, respectively, &quot;Loudwire&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; ranked it as the 22nd and 8th best power metal album of all time.

<doc id="585558" wikidata="Q902943" url="?curid=585558" title="Dead Winter Dead">
<text>Dead Winter Dead is the ninth studio album by the American heavy metal band Savatage, released in 1995. It is a concept album, that tells a story from the perspectives of a Serb boy, a Bosniak girl and an old man. The story of the album is set during the Bosnian War, which was ongoing at the time.

&quot;Dead Winter Dead&quot; marked the first Savatage album to feature guitarist Chris Caffery, who had been an occasional and touring member of the band since 1987, but had become an official permanent member by the time the album was recorded. Alex Skolnick, who had played guitars on Savatage&#x27;s previous album &quot;Handful of Rain&quot;, opted not to stay around for the next album in order to concentrate on his solo band. Singer Jon Oliva took drummer Jeff Plate from the &quot;Handful of Rain&quot; tour, and brought in his old friend Caffery, former member and Doctor Butcher member to join the band. Atlantic Records also felt that the band needed a second, more well-known guitarist to complete the line-up. Al Pitrelli, formerly a member of Alice Cooper&#x27;s touring band, became the co-lead guitarist for the band.

This record gave the band an unexpected radio hit in &quot;Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)&quot;, and the band decided they wanted to explore this kind of music in a different way. Around this time, Paul O&#x27;Neill, along with Robert Kinkel, was interested in starting up what became the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. It was later re-released by TSO as &quot;Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 1994&quot; on their first release, &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot;.

The track &quot;Mozart and Madness&quot; quotes directly from the opening theme of Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 25, and was re-recorded as &quot;Mozart and Memories&quot; as released on the later TSO album &quot;Night Castle&quot;; whilst &quot;Memory&quot; quotes directly from the fourth movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th symphony (&quot;Ode to Joy&quot;).

== Story ==
In the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, there is a town square surrounded by buildings that were constructed during the Middle Ages. The square has a beautiful stone fountain at its center and at one corner there is a thousand year old church with a gargoyle carved into its belfry. This gargoyle, for the last thousand years, has spent all his time trying to comprehend the human emotions of laughter and sorrow, but even after a millennium of contemplation, these most curious of human attributes remain a total mystery to him. Our story begins in the year of 1990; the Berlin Wall has just fallen, communism has collapsed and for the first time since the Roman Empire, Yugoslavia finds itself a free nation. Serdjan Aleskovic cannot believe his good fortune to be alive and young at such a moment. The future and the happiness of all seem assured in what must surely be &quot;the best of times&quot; (&quot;Sarajevo&quot;, &quot;This Is the Time&quot;).

However, even as Serdjan celebrates with his fellow countrymen, there are little men with little minds who are already busy sowing the seeds of hate between neighbors. Young and impressionable Serdjan joins some of his friends in a Serbian Militia Unit and eventually finds himself in the hills outside of Sarajevo firing mortar shells nightly in the city (&quot;I Am&quot;). Meanwhile, in Sarajevo itself, Katrina Brasic, a young Muslim girl, finds herself buying weapons from a group of arms merchants and then joining her comrades firing in the hills around the city (&quot;Starlight&quot;, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Matter Anyway&quot;).

The years pass by and it is now late November 1994. An old man who had left Yugoslavia many decades before, has now returned to the city of his birth, only to find it in ruins. As the season&#x27;s first snowfall begins, he stands in the town square, looks toward the heavens and explains that when the Yugoslavians prayed for change, this is not what they intended (&quot;This Isn&#x27;t What We Meant&quot;).

As the old man finishes his prayer, the sun begins to set and the first shells of the evening&#x27;s artillery barrage are starting to arc overhead. But instead of heading for the shelters with the rest of the civilians, he climbs atop the rubble that used to be the fountain and taking out his cello, starts to play Mozart as the shells explode around him. From this night forward he would repeat this ritual every evening. And every evening Serdjan and Katrina each find themselves listening to the thoughts of Mozart and Beethoven as they drift between the explosions across no man&#x27;s land (&quot;Mozart and Madness&quot;, &quot;Memory&quot;).

Though the winter does its best to cover the landscape with a blanket of temporary innocence, the war only escalates in violence and brutality (&quot;Dead Winter Dead&quot;). One day in late December, Serdjan on a patrol in Sarajevo, comes across a schoolyard where a recent exploding shell has left the ground littered with the bodies of young children. It is one thing to drop shells into a mortar and quite another to see where they land. Long after Serdjan returns to his own lines, he cannot get the faces of the children out of his mind. Realizing that what he has been participating in is not the glorious nation building that their leaders had described, but rather a path to mutual oblivion, he decides right then and there that he can no longer be a part of this, that you cannot build a future on the bodies of others. At the first opportunity, he resolves that he will desert (&quot;One Child&quot;).

Sitting in his bunker on December 24, he listens to the sounds of Christmas carols from the old cello player mingling with the sounds of war. Katrina, on the other side of the battlefield, is also listening. It had just stopped snowing and the clouds had given way to reveal a beautiful star-filled sky when suddenly the cellos player&#x27;s music abruptly ceases. Fearing the worst, Serdjan and Katrina both do something quite foolish and from their respectives sides, start to make their ways across no man&#x27;s land toward the town square. Arriving at exactly the same moment, they see one another. Instinctively realizing that they are both there for the same reason, they do not start to fight, but instead, together walk slowly to the fountain. There they find the old man lying dead in the snow, his face covered with blood, his cello lying smashed and broken at his side (&quot;Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)&quot;).

Then without warning, a single drop of liquid falls from the cloudless sky, wiping some of the blood off the old man&#x27;s cheek. Serdjan looks up, but he can see nothing except the stone gargoyle high up on the church belfry. Overcome by what he has seen this night, he decides that he must leave this war immediately. Turning to the Muslim girl he asks her to come with him, but now all she sees is his Serbian uniform. Pouring out his feelings, he explains that he is not what she thinks that he is. Eventually winning her to his side, they leave the night together (&quot;Not What You See&quot;).

==Reception==

In a contemporary review, Matthias Breusch of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine remarked how the album is the band&#x27;s &quot;most significant move so far in the direction of classical-symphonic bombast compositions&quot; with &quot;piano and string arrangements (...) omnipresent&quot;, even if &quot;dedicated fans&quot; would miss the &quot;fine line between genius and madness, on which the interaction of the two Oliva brothers up to and including &quot;Edge of Thorns&quot; has driven every Savatage album.&quot; He judged &quot;the instrumentals &#x27;Overture: Sarajevo&#x27;, &#x27;Mozart and Madness&#x27; and &#x27;Christmas Eve&#x27;&quot; and the quieter numbers, &quot;like the exquisite &#x27;This Is Not What We Meant&#x27;, &#x27;Now What You See&#x27;, &#x27;This Is the Time&#x27; or &#x27;One Child&#x27;&quot;, the true highlights of the album, while he considered the title track &quot;somewhat lethargic&quot; and the uptempo songs &quot;mediocre&quot;.

Modern reviews are positive. AllMusic reviewer wrote that &quot;Savatage have built upon the musical ground of &quot;Handful of Rain&quot; with grand but heavy arrangements of theatrical and complex pieces&quot;, resulting in &quot;something that could appear in many a Broadway show&quot; and with the music nicely capturing &quot;the wide range of emotion that the narrative calls for.&quot; In fact, Sputnikmusic reviewer declared that &quot;&quot;Dead Winter Dead&quot; really feels like a sort of heavier, more vocally-driven first Trans-Siberian Orchestra album&quot;, but also &quot;true to metal form with plenty of aggressive vocals and fast, heavy riffs&quot; establishing &quot;war as the predominant atmosphere.&quot; Martin Popoff in his review for &quot;The Collector&#x27;s Guide to Heavy Metal&quot; wrote that &quot;Dead Winter Dead&quot; is simply &quot;a great piece of theatre, elegant, expressive, guitar-driven storytelling of the highest order&quot;, making &quot;one of the most forceful concept records going, not so much sad as it might have been, but imposing.&quot;

<text>The Dungeons Are Calling is an EP by the American heavy metal band Savatage, released in 1984 by Par Records. Though the EP was not released until 1984, most of the songs featured on it and the debut album, &quot;Sirens&quot;, had been in the band set list since 1979, and are part of the &quot;Live in Clearwater&quot; and &quot;City Beneath the Surface&quot; EPs. &quot;The Dungeons Are Calling&quot; is a loosely based concept album and the title track, contrary to popular belief, is not about Hell or torture, but about the horrors of drug use. The song used many metaphors, which have been sometimes misunderstood.

The tracks on this EP were recorded the same day as the tracks for the &quot;Sirens&quot; album. The two were meant to be a full-length debut but were divided due to limited space for songs on vinyl. The two were released together in 2011 for the first time &quot;as they were meant to be&quot; (Jon Oliva).

The cover is a picture of a human skull with a homemade syringe, a reference to the title track of the album.

==Critical reception==
In 2005, &quot;The Dungeons Are Calling&quot; was ranked number 349 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="585562" wikidata="Q2624716" url="?curid=585562" title="Franklin Richards (character)">
<text>Franklin Benjamin Richards is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is a supporting character in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. He has been portrayed as a child and as a novice superhero.

Franklin is an immensely powerful being with vast reality-manipulating and psionic powers beyond most Omega level mutants. He is the son of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman of the Fantastic Four, the older brother of Valeria Richards, and the nephew of Invisible Woman&#x27;s younger brother, the Human Torch. His parents named him Franklin Benjamin Richards; his middle name is taken from his godfather Ben Grimm, the Thing. Franklin&#x27;s first name comes from Franklin Storm, his maternal grandfather. He has started using the code name Powerhouse. Franklin restricts the use of his powers to once a year in order to give himself a normal, healthy childhood.

==Publication history==
Franklin first appears in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #6 (November 1968), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, although he didn&#x27;t receive his name until two years later in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #94 (January 1970). Lee recounted: 

Appearing sporadically in the pages of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; over the following fifteen years, Franklin became a member of the pre-teen superhero team Power Pack as of issue #17 (December 1985) of that title until its cancellation with issue #62 (February 1991). From November 1994 an older version of the same character (aged for the purposes of a story) appeared in the pages of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Force&quot; until publication ceased as of April 1996. Between appearances in these other titles, Franklin has remained a recurring cast member of the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; comic book. From July 2007 until the series&#x27; cancellation in February 2009, an alternate version of Franklin appeared as a cast member in the Marvel Adventures all-ages &quot;Power Pack&quot; series of titles.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Richards was born in New York City to Reed and Susan Richards. He began manifesting his powers while still a toddler due to his parents&#x27; radiation-altered genes, which drew the attention of Annihilus, who sought to use Franklin as a source for his own resurgence, transferring some measure of the child&#x27;s latent power to himself with a gene-based machine, and releasing Franklin&#x27;s full potential in the process. Fearing the immediate threat of his son&#x27;s powers to the entire populace of Earth and unable to find another solution in time, Reed Richards shut down Franklin&#x27;s mind.

During a battle between Ultron-7 and the Fantastic Four, Ultron&#x27;s energy output awoke Franklin and again released his powers, resulting in the sentient robot&#x27;s defeat. Free of the energies expended in the confrontation with Ultron, Franklin was seemingly returned to his normal power level.

Needing someone to watch over Franklin in their absence, Reed and Susan Richards came to rely on the services of an elderly woman known as Agatha Harkness, who is also a benevolent witch. Franklin and Agatha soon developed a familial-like bond, even residing together for a time at Whisper Hill (Agatha&#x27;s old residence, which was regularly destroyed and rebuilt). Eventually, Agatha returned to live in the secret witch community of New Salem, Colorado, and Franklin moved back in permanently with his parents and the rest of the Fantastic Four. His powers, no longer dormant, continued to manifest themselves.

Under the care of yet another guardian, a robot nicknamed H.E.R.B.I.E., Franklin unintentionally used his reality warping abilities to age himself into adulthood. In this form, he was an adept at molecular manipulation and psionics. On realizing his mistake, he restored himself to childhood.

Despite his youth and inexperience, Franklin, a victim of many threats and abductions, has exhibited great courage in the face of overwhelming peril. Time and again, he has unknowingly saved innocent lives, including that of his famous family, from the likes of villainous perpetrators, such as Blastaar, Norman Osborn, Onslaught, Nicholas Scratch, and even the all-powerful Mephisto, whom he temporarily destroyed and later defeated on two separate occasions.

===Attempt at a normal life===
To try to give his son a &quot;normal&quot; life, Reed Richards devised psychic inhibitors to prevent his powers from being used, but Franklin, whether by fault or by intent, could still at times bypass the inhibitors and use his powers, such as projecting an image of himself at a long distance. At this point he secretly joined a team of pre-teen superheroes called Power Pack, in which he was code-named &quot;Tattletale&quot;.

Franklin&#x27;s adventures with Power Pack gained him an enemy in the alien Zn&#x27;rx, and allies and friends in the Kymellian Whitemanes. Franklin was particularly close to the young Kofi Whitemane, who declared Franklin an honorary cousin in much the same way as the children of Power Pack had been adopted as honorary Whitemanes. Franklin also regarded the Power children and their parents as a sort of surrogate family — his association with them beginning at a time when he was feeling particularly distant from his parents at a time when they were living at Avengers Mansion. During this period Franklin also bonded emotionally with Avengers associate and manservant Edwin Jarvis, as Jarvis was his primary caretaker while Franklin stayed at the mansion. His friendship with the Power children also gave Franklin a taste of life among siblings, which the lonely Franklin would not experience until much later when his sister Valeria was born.

The Richards and Power families became fast friends, though neither family&#x27;s parents realized that any of the children other than Franklin were superpowered (though Susan and Reed discovered this later). Franklin even kept his membership of Power Pack a secret from his own parents: when he appeared before them in image form (see above) he would stick to ordinary clothes, only appearing in his Power Pack outfit before other heroes such as Kitty Pryde.

Franklin even lived with the Power family for a time, when his parents decided that a superhero headquarters was a dangerous place for a child to live, and wanted Franklin to spend time in a &quot;normal&quot; family environment. He returned to his family when Power Pack temporarily left Earth for the Kymellian homeworld.

===Psi-Lord===
Franklin was later kidnapped by his time-traveling grandfather Nathaniel Richards, and replaced with his teenage counterpart, Psi-Lord, who had been raised by Nathaniel in a dimension outside of time. Franklin, as Psi-Lord, helped create the short-lived team known as Fantastic Force. By tapping a stud hidden within the glove of his costume, Franklin was able to summon battle armor from a pocket dimension; it was designed specifically to siphon off the full measure of his powers. As such, Franklin&#x27;s abilities at this time were limited to telepathy, precognition, and psionic energy blasts.

Around this time, Sue&#x27;s dark persona, Malice, began warring within her mind for supremacy of her body, causing Sue to become more prone to angry outbursts and a more violent use of her powers, as well as starting to wear a more revealing costume. Eventually, Psi-Lord expunged the Malice personality from Sue&#x27;s body into his own. There, Malice plagued Psi-Lord for a short time. Later during a battle against the Dark Raider (an evil alternate reality version of Reed Richards) Psi-Lord and the Invisible Woman forced the Malice persona into the Raider&#x27;s mind leading to his defeat and the apparent destruction of the Malice persona.

Nathaniel eventually revealed that in another possible future timeline, Franklin Richards would, with Rachel Summers, father a terrible time-and dimension-traveling supervillain named Hyperstorm. In an effort to divert the attention of the Fantastic Four, Nathaniel traveled back to the precise point in time when Franklin was abducted by Nathaniel Richards and returned the child to his parents mere seconds after he was first kidnapped, thus rendering the Psi-Lord version of Franklin Richards obsolete in the Earth-616 timeline.

===Onslaught===
Shortly after these events, Onslaught kidnaps Franklin in order to use his abilities to reshape reality. To defeat Onslaught, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, the X-Men, and several other heroes destroy first his physical form, and then his psychic form. In the process, Franklin&#x27;s parents seemingly die. Franklin displays his true power, singlehandedly creating the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; pocket universe to contain the heroes who had &quot;died&quot; in that adventure. Some of them are recreated based on Franklin&#x27;s memories of them, such as the temporally-displaced teenage Tony Stark becoming an adult once more while the mutated Wasp is restored to human form. While his parents are away in the Heroes Reborn universe, Generation X and Alicia Masters look after Franklin. This universe comes to be represented by a small, bluish ball which Franklin carries with him.

Franklin travels with several X-Men to the farm owned by Hank McCoy&#x27;s parents. He plays with Artie Maddicks and Leech, both mutant children. The Celestials recognize that Franklin represents the culmination of their genetic experiments, that he has power to rival even theirs. Ashema, one of the Celestials, representing herself as a human, visits Franklin. Ultimately, Franklin, Ashema and other forces allow the rightful heroes to return and both universes to remain functioning.

In the wake of Mr. Fantastic&#x27;s activation of the Ultimate Nullifier to destroy Abraxas, Franklin loses all his powers in the process of reforming Galactus and thus becomes a normal child. Shortly afterwards, Doctor Doom makes a pact with the Haazareth Three to gain vast magical power. During Doom&#x27;s attacks upon the Fantastic Four, Franklin is sucked into Hell by the Haazareth. After the defeat of Doom, his parents rescue him, but Franklin has a hard time coping with the traumatic experience of being tormented in Hell. The Thing helps Franklin make a complete mental recovery by assuring him that, even if they couldn&#x27;t always keep him safe, they would never give up on him.

When the Scarlet Witch uses her powers to depower countless mutants, including Magneto and Professor X, the power lost by Magneto and Xavier combines and restores Onslaught, whose consciousness still lingered after his death. Onslaught takes control of both the Human Torch and Mister Fantastic in an attempt to get Franklin but is interrupted by the Thing and Invisible Woman.

When Franklin flees to Counter-Earth, Onslaught follows him. The Avengers assess their new threat which did not exist until Franklin appeared. After a brief skirmish, the heroes and villains decide to work together to defeat Onslaught. Rikki Barnes defeats him using a Fantasticar to send them both through the Negative Zone barrier in the Fantastic Four&#x27;s lab, trapping them. Franklin returns home, Barnes finds herself on Earth-616, and Onslaught is seen floating outside the Area 42 Prison in the Negative Zone.

===Secret Invasion===
In the beginning of the Skrull strike on Earth, the Skrull Lyja, impersonating Sue Richards, sends the entire Baxter Building into the Negative Zone with Franklin, Valeria, and Johnny Storm inside. Franklin and Valeria team up with Johnny and the Thing to fight the Skrulls. Benjamin Grimm asks the help of the Tinkerer, who is a prisoner in the prison for the unregistered villains in the Negative Zone. The Tinkerer refuses, seeing no reason to help the people who arrested him as he was taking his grandchildren out for ice cream, and sent him to prison without due process. Franklin and Valeria plead with the Tinkerer. They strongly remind the old man of his own grandchildren. He is moved to tears, repents and agrees to help, in exchange for his freedom and reunion with his grandkids.

===Dark Reign===
During the &quot;Dark Reign: Fantastic Four&quot; miniseries; Franklin finds himself along with his sister under siege by Norman Osborn, Venom and a high number of H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. The siblings were on their own due to their father&#x27;s experiment which left him unreachable and the other members of the Fantastic Four stranded in alternate realities.

Valeria manages to separate Osborn from the rest of the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents by using a bureaucratic technicality and by having them underestimate her. Osborn is led into a room where he faces Franklin who is wearing a Spider-Man mask and calls him a villain. In the next scene, the two are chased down a hall by Osborn who is getting ready to shoot them. The Fantastic Four return just in time to protect the children. Mister Fantastic tells Osborn to leave the Baxter Building and not to come back. Osborn attempts to shoot Reed, only to be shot in the shoulder by Franklin. The gun Franklin used is by all accounts, a simple toy.

On his birthday, Franklin is seemingly attacked by a strange intruder which is later revealed to be a future version of Franklin himself sent back through time to deliver a warning to Valeria about an approaching conflict. In the final pages, it is revealed that the attack by the adult Franklin was to plant a telepathic suggestion in the mind of his present-day counterpart, thereby apparently reawakening young Franklin&#x27;s dormant mutant powers; in actuality, Franklin is not a mutant, but has subconsciously convinced the wider world at large that he is.

===Search for the Invisible Woman===
Franklin and his sister contact X-Factor Investigations, led by Madrox the Multiple Man. They find that their mother has strangely disappeared and think that their father had something to do with it. According to the children, Reed Richards had been acting very strange the last couple of days. The team investigates and find that not only Sue was trapped, but also Reed, who has been replaced with an alternate version being mind-controlled by an alternate version of Doctor Doom. X-Factor find the real Reed in Latveria. X-Factor and the Fantastic Four battle Doctor Doom and Layla Miller. Doom lets them &quot;rescue&quot; Sue and tells them all to leave. During the battle in New York, the alternate Doom/Reed is accidentally killed.

===Fear Itself===
During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Franklin, against his father&#x27;s prior wishes, uses his reality-warping powers to free Ben Grimm from the possession of an Asgardian warrior general named Angrir: Breaker of Souls by transforming him back into the Thing.

===Future Foundation===
Franklin is approached by a mysterious stranger, who has been secretly tutoring him in the use of his powers. The stranger is later revealed to be a future adult incarnation of Franklin himself, who reiterates to his young counterpart that his powers must be properly harnessed for a singular intent: the act of life preservation. In a confrontation between the Future Foundation and the Mad Celestials of Earth-4280, Franklin is described by one of the Celestials as &#x27;beyond [the] Omega classification&#x27; applied to mutants, and is subsequently attacked with concussion beams. Franklin repels their attacks.

Upon successfully creating a new future and simultaneously acting as an anchor for the changes he made in the process following the collapse of all reality into a single timestream, culminating with the heat death of everything, the adult Franklin, alongside his sister, a future incarnation of Valeria Richards, enters the fray in the final struggle against the Mad Celestials of Earth-4280. He warps the three Celestials away to the inner sphere of a local gas giant. He then acquires an orb containing his younger counterpart&#x27;s powers, which he stores within his chest. When the Celestials return, the adult Franklin uses the orb to revive an incapacitated Galactus. Franklin and Galactus confront the Celestials and destroy them in a prolonged battle. In the aftermath, the adult Franklin shares a brief moment with Galactus. The two discuss the heat death of everything and the revelation of Franklin&#x27;s immortality, specifically that he will, billions of years from now, stand beside Galactus to witness the birth of a new universe.

===Secret Wars===
Following the destruction of the multiverse during the events of &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, Doctor Doom gained the power of the Beyonders and used it to reform the remnants of the destroyed realities into the patchwork planet Battleworld. Eventually those powers were stripped from Doctor Doom by the Molecule Man and transferred to Reed Richards. With his new powers, Reed along with his family, the Future Foundation and Molecule Man, began to restore the multiverse, while also creating entirely new realities.

===Multiversal adventures===
As they rebuild the multiverse, a being self-described as the embodiment of entropy, the Griever at the End of All Things, patiently waited to strike until Franklin Richards is depleted of his ability to create new universes as she repudiated their mission, claiming they overstepped their purpose. During this time, Franklin has taken up the codename of Powerhouse. With the help from the heroes who were part of the Fantastic Four’s expanding members, including X-Men’s Iceman, they were able to defeat the Griever’s army. Franklin and Valeria, and their parents bids their fellow Foundation members, entrusted by Dragonman a farewell, as Earth wanted the Fantastic Four to return.

===Return to Earth===
Because time worked very differently when they were rebuilding the multiverse, Franklin and his sister returned to Earth as young teenagers many days after the Hydra Captain America’s Secret Empire. After returning to Earth, his family entrusted their old Baxter Building to the superhero team Fantastix, and moved to Thing&#x27;s hometown Yancy Street as a new base operation and home. When a wedding between his god-uncle Thing and his new god-aunt Alicia is about to begin many days later, Franklin begins to dye his hair black.

Another problem arose with Franklin&#x27;s powers, they became depleted every time Franklin used them, for unknown reasons and even his father cannot understand why.

===Dawn of X===
Since Krakoa became a safe haven for all mutants, accessible only to those who carry the X-gene, an invitation was made to Franklin to live on the island of Krakoa, however, his parents decided it was better for him to remain with them. But when Xavier noted that Franklin&#x27;s powers were depleting, he decided it was the right moment to take Franklin to Krakoa. So, Xavier and Magneto concocted a plan to usher Franklin to Krakoa by means of using his relationship with Kitty Pryde, employing the premise that they would be either helping Franklin get the full extent of his powers back or discerning if what&#x27;s happening to young Franklin could also emerge in other mutants.

Later, during the Fantastic Four&#x27;s confrontation against the unstoppable alien Cormorant, Franklin used the last remains of his powers in an attempt to stop the enemy, but failed. After losing his powers, Franklin tried to travel to Krakoa, only to be interrupted telepathically by Xavier, who informed the youth of the discovery that he was not really a mutant, but rather his mutant status had been a result of him using subconsciously his powers on himself to altering his anatomy in a cellular level. With his powers gone, Franklin was no longer a mutant and as a result, Xavier declared that he was no longer welcomed in Krakoa.

===The Secret of Franklin Richards===
After resuming a normal, everyday life with his family, Franklin awakens one night to find his conscious control over his reality-altering powers restored. Having previously reasoned that if his abilities were left unchecked throughout his remaining adolescence, he would never be able to grow up normally or reach the emotional development needed to use them wisely as an adult, Franklin chose to keep his powers hidden from himself and others except for one day a year when he wakes up and remembers everything. On such days, Franklin uses his powers to explore the multiverse for any potential threats and only intervenes when absolutely necessary.

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Franklin possesses the power to warp reality, i.e., to make any thought or desire come to fruition, even up to a cosmic scale. He is able to rearrange the molecular structure of matter and energy at will. Once, Franklin subconsciously created his own pocket universe, encompassing a virtual replica of Earth-616. Cosmic entities, including Galactus, Eternity, Infinity, Omniversal Guardian Roma, and Omniversal Majestrix Opal Luna Saturnyne, began to take notice of Franklin&#x27;s tremendous gifts, going so far to describe him as a &quot;being whom the Celestials felt was on par with themselves&quot;. Two Celestials, Ashema the Listener and Nezarr the Calculator, were at one time tasked with retrieving Franklin for evaluation as a new member of the Celestial Host, a group of beings recognized as &quot;gods&quot; by the Eternals and Deviants.

In addition to reality and molecular manipulation, Franklin has vast psionic powers that have manifested as telepathy, telekinesis, energy blasts of concussive force, precognition, and astral projection. Being a child, Franklin&#x27;s abilities are restricted to an extent by his limited control. Moreover, it remains unclear what power levels Franklin will ultimately achieve as an adult, as several future incarnations from alternate realities as well as the mainstream Marvel universe have been shown to vary in power. One such manifestation of Franklin in adult form was able to destroy two Celestials from Earth-4280 during physical combat; in the aftermath of their defeat, Franklin&#x27;s immortality was strongly implied. The same individual also tapped into the power of his younger self to resurrect and transform Galactus into his own personal herald after the Devourer of Worlds had been rendered unconscious in battle against the Mad Celestials.

==Other versions==

===&quot;Days of Future Past&quot;===
In the 1981 X-Men storyline &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, it was revealed that in one possible future, Franklin (known as &#x27;Scrapper&#x27;) would be the lover of Rachel Summers; he would also meet his untimely death at the hands of Omega Sentinels. In variants of this timeline, Franklin and Rachel give birth to the nigh-unstoppable villain Hyperstorm, a mutant who is capable of drawing virtually limitless energy from Hyperspace itself. Another child Franklin fathers with Rachel (in a reality that only slightly diverges from Earth-811) is known as Dream Summers. Dream, a mutant like her parents, demonstrates telepathy/empathy.

The dream-self of the deceased adult Franklin Richards Earth-811 (seen in the 1990 &quot;Days of Future Present&quot; crossover) tapped into the powers of both his younger Earth-616 counterpart and Rachel Summers, augmenting his own abilities with the near-infinite energy of the Phoenix Force.

===Earth-10235===
In his reality, an invasion of Mad Celestials caused a collapse of it into a single timestream and Franklin, Valeria and Nathaniel Richards, were apparently, the only survivors in this reality close to extinction. He made a plan with Valeria and Nathaniel to save the reality, he traveled to Earth-616 and used his reality shifting powers to restore his past counterpart self&#x27;s mutant abilities, as well as advising the past Valeria about things she has to do in order to save the future.

After Nathaniel Richards battled his other counterparts in a game set by Immortus and remained as the last Reed Richards, Franklin forced him to travel back in time and help the Fantastic Four, at that time Future Foundation, to fight the alternate Reed Richards loose on Earth-616 and deal with the invasion of the Mad Celestials until he and Valeria could escape from the destruction of their reality and arrive to finish their plan. They arrived during Galactus battle against the Mad Celestials and, using his power, he teleported them into a gas giant, withstood direct assault and even killed one by himself. He then, with the help of his younger self&#x27;s powers, was capable of reviving Galactus, who had been rendered unconscious in battle, and turned him into his herald which he then used to destroy the Celestials. After the reality was saved, Franklin shares a brief moment with Galactus; the two discuss the heat death of everything and the revelation of Franklin&#x27;s immortality, specifically that he will, billions of years from now, stand beside Galactus to witness the birth of a new universe.

Billions of years later, Franklin is seen with Galactus at the End of Time to witness the birth of the Ninth Cosmos. Franklin is meant to become the next Galactus and while they wait, Galactus chronicles the complete story of the Eighth Cosmos, revealing previously unknown secrets. In a potential timeline, both Franklin and Galactus were killed by the Immortal Hulk who also kills the last Homo Supreme, the ultimate evolution of mutants that was a backup in case Franklin was killed, thus becoming the only being left in the universe. When the Sentience of the Eighth Cosmos came to greet what he thought was Bruce Banner, he soon discovered that it was an elaborate trick put in motion by the One Below All, a malevolent entity that resides in the Below-Place, the deepest layer of Hell, which had possessed the Hulk and then quickly devoured the Sentience of the Eighth Cosmos and absorbed its power.

===&quot;Fantastic Four: Annual 1998&quot;===
In &quot;Fantastic Four: Annual 1998&quot;, a version of Franklin is seen where he aged in real time from his first appearance. He is married to a Wakandan woman named Zawadi and has a daughter named N&#x27;Yami. Franklin is also a member of the Fantastic Four named Zero Man and had the ability to access the Negative Zone through a portal that he could create. He had to wear a special Vibranium headband to help him control his abilities.

===&quot;Earth X&quot;===
In &quot;Earth X&quot;, Franklin Richards curses Namor for killing the Human Torch. Half of Namor&#x27;s body is now constantly burning, even underwater. Afterwards, Franklin takes Galactus&#x27; armor and, entering the third stage of his evolution, becomes Galactus himself. As stated in the story, he is Galactus as long as no one tells him he isn&#x27;t. As Galactus, Franklin Richards saves the Earth by consuming the Celestial growing inside. He reveals himself to his father, Reed, before leaving the Earth, stating he will never return. At the end of the story, Reed, after gaining the cosmic consciousness, states his first task will be to save his son.

===Exiles===
The Exiles, a group of superheroes taken from several different realities, traveled to a future Earth where their mission was to stop Franklin Richards&#x27; son from conquering that world. Franklin himself is not shown in this storyline.

===&quot;Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius&quot;===
In the out-of-continuity humor series &quot;Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius&quot;, Franklin is portrayed as a Calvin-esque troublemaker who can&#x27;t resist &quot;playing&quot; with his father&#x27;s inventions, with disastrous results. Franklin must then scramble to reverse the effects/clean up after the results of his &quot;play&quot;, with the help of his long-suffering robot nanny H.E.R.B.I.E. (who essentially plays a Hobbes-esque role), or face punishment from his parents. The first twelve &quot;Son of a Genius&quot; one-shots were drawn by Chris Eliopoulos and co-written by Eliopoulos and Marc Sumerak. Since then, Eliopoulos has written them solo.

&quot;Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius&quot; began as a series of back-up strips, each one appearing in all Marvel books released in a certain publishing week. The strips were well received by Marvel readership and the concept was granted a self-titled one-shot, which primarily reprinted the published strips to date. Subsequent books in the series have consisted of new material, and they are currently being published on a roughly quarterly basis. There have been fourteen specials published so far, and this particular version of Franklin and H.E.R.B.I.E. has since appeared with Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers in &quot;Tails of the Pet Avengers: Dogs of Summer&quot; (July 2010).

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
In &quot;House of M&quot;, Franklin is mentioned by Emma Frost as being one of her patients since the death of his parents.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;===
In the &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot; one-shot (which served as a prequel to the Marvel Zombies 2005/2006 miniseries), Franklin and his sister Valeria were suddenly eaten by zombie She-Hulk.

===MC2===
In the MC2 universe, Franklin is in the Fantastic Five under the name of Psi-Lord, his powers reduced to telekinesis after a battle with Hyperstorm. He&#x27;s also that universe&#x27;s Nexus Being, someone who exists in all possible realities, a focus of mystical energies. He has a friendly relationship with Spider-Girl. They are mutually attracted to each other until her father, Spider-Man, points out that she is only 15, several years younger than Franklin. After that, Franklin stops flirting with her. It was revealed that Franklin recommended Kate Power to help the Avengers find the powerless Thunderstrike. During &quot;Fantastic Five&quot; vol. 2 #4, a huge increase in his powers, triggered when Franklin deliberately exposes himself to cosmic rays to enhance his powers to cope with the threat posed by the newly returned Doctor Doom, leaves him with stronger psionic powers and with a blazing skull for a face, forcing him to wear a containment helmet at all times.

===Power Pack – All Ages Version===
In the &quot;Fantastic Four and Power Pack&quot; miniseries, an alternate timeline Franklin Richards is promoted a few grades and enrolled in the same class as Jack Power. Because of persecution as a result of him having the Richards name, Reed later decides that he should be kept in the Baxter Building for home schooling, possibly as long as college. Franklin then runs away with Jack, then proceeds to get captured by Doctor Doom. Doom switches bodies with Franklin for a short time to pursue the destruction of the Fantastic Four, leaving Franklin trapped in Doom&#x27;s comatose body. When Jack Power undoes the body swap, Franklin wakes up and immediately leads the Power Pack in sending Doctor Doom to the Negative Zone.

After this adventure, Julie Power creates a costume for Franklin, dubbing him the &quot;honorary fifth member&quot;. The costume looks like a standard Power Pack costume, done in orange and having the all-seeing eye icon of his &quot;Tattletale&quot; costume from the original series. Although the costume was made of regular materials instead of using the alien materials that accounts for the special abilities of the other Power Pack costumes, Franklin&#x27;s father has modified the &quot;Tattletale&quot; costume using unstable molecules.

In the &quot;Power Pack: Day One&quot; miniseries, Franklin is staying with the Power family, due to the Fantastic Four going on a space mission. During his stay, Franklin is learning from the Power siblings the origin of how they became Power Pack.

In the first issue of the &quot;Skrulls vs. Power Pack&quot; miniseries, Franklin and the Power siblings were at a bowling alley, when they were attacked by bounty hunters. While the hunters captured and delivered the Pack to Patchworld, Franklin managed to return to the Baxter Building to ask his parents to help rescue them, but instead depended upon the aid from both the Smartship Friday and his robot nanny H.E.R.B.I.E.

This version of Franklin to date hasn&#x27;t displayed any powers; he does have great courage and intelligence. He also has some impressive high-tech gadgets that Reed and Franklin built together. These save his life during the Galactic bounty hunter attack.

Franklin, the Power siblings, H.E.R.B.I.E., and Friday eventually reach the Puzzle Planet and solve the mystery of the planet of origin of Eternity&#x27;s Children, as named in an ancient secret prophecy. All the children do their part with their intelligence and powers to solve the puzzles, but it is Franklin who ties it all together with his scientific knowledge and analytic ability.

With the main continuity, the &quot;Son of a Genius&quot; series, and the all ages version of Power Pack, there are now three different versions (within the different continuities) of Franklin Richards fighting the Skrull invasion.

===Forever Yesterday===
In an alternate reality detailed in &quot;New Warriors&quot; #11–13, the Richards family is part of a resistance movement against the tyrannical Sphinx. They join with the family of Dwayne Taylor. Despite their age differences, Franklin and Dwayne are shown as friends. An attack by agents of the Sphinx leaves all but Dwayne murdered.

===Other future incarnations===
In &quot;Power Pack&quot; #36 (published in April 1987), Franklin and his friends battled the giant robot Master Mold. The Master Mold&#x27;s primary objective was to eliminate , the future leaders of mutant-kind. Describing Franklin as a mutant entity of the &quot;ultimate&quot; potential, and the only mutant ever to develop such power, the machine visualizes possible future incarnations of the child prior to seeking him out for annihilation. One image depicts Franklin as a young man clad in a dark blue suit with a red jacket, yellow boots, yellow and gloves. Master Mold refers to this adolescent version of Franklin as Ultiman. Another image shows a striking figure somewhat older in appearance than Ultiman (closely resembling the Silver Surfer) with marks upon his face similar to the &quot;hound scars&quot; commonly associated with Rachel Summers of Earth-811. As per Master Mold, this adult incarnation of Franklin is simply called &quot;The Twelfth&quot;.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In &quot;Ultimate X-Men/Fantastic Four Annual #1&quot;, a young Franklin Richards is part of a future team of X-Men. It is revealed that in all of the possible futures, Franklin is Reed (as Nihil) and Sue&#x27;s son. He is also revealed to be the host to that timeline&#x27;s Phoenix force.
