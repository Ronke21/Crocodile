<doc id="585029" wikidata="Q7588180" url="?curid=585029" title="St. George, Staten Island">
<text>St. George is a neighborhood on the northeastern tip of Staten Island in New York City, along the waterfront where the Kill Van Kull enters Upper New York Bay. It is the most densely developed neighborhood on Staten Island, and the location of the administrative center for the borough and for the Richmond County. The St. George Terminal, serving the Staten Island Ferry and the Staten Island Railway, is also located here. St. George is bordered on the south by the neighborhood of Tompkinsville and on the west by the neighborhood of New Brighton.

What is now St. George was initially occupied by the Lenape Native Americans, then colonized by the Dutch and the British. The first residential developments arose in the 1830s, and through the late 19th century, the area was a summer resort. Until the construction of the ferry–railroad terminal in 1886, present-day St. George was considered to be part of New Brighton. The section around the current ferry and railroad terminal was renamed after developer George Law, whom Erastus Wiman promised to &quot;canonize&quot; in exchange for relinquishing the land rights for the terminal. Several government buildings and landmarks were constructed in St. George in the early 20th century, and further developments on the waterfront commenced in the early 21st century.

St. George is part of Staten Island Community District 1. St. George is patrolled by the 120th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

== History ==
=== Precolonial and colonial period ===
Originally, Staten Island was inhabited by the Munsee-speaking Lenape Native Americans. The Lenape relocated during different seasons, moving toward the shore to fish during the summers, and moving inland to hunt and grow crops during the fall and winter. The present-day area of New York City was inhabited in 1624 by Dutch settlers as part of New Netherland. In 1664, the Dutch gave New Netherland to the British, and six years later the British finalized a purchase agreement with the Lenape.

At the time of British handover, several British, Dutch, and French settlers occupied the area, but did not have an established title to the land. A series of surveys were conducted through 1677, and several parcels were distributed to different landowners. Among them were the &quot;Duxbury Glebe&quot;, given to Ellis Duxbury in 1708, bequeathed to the Protestant Episcopal Church of St. Andrew&#x27;s ten years later, and then leased for 54 years by John Bard in 1765. Another tract was granted to Lambert Jansen Dorlant in 1680, whose western boundary was a brook on present-day Jersey Street. By 1748, it had been purchased by Salmon Comes, who ran a ferry to Manhattan. By 1765, part of the Dorlant tract was owned by John Wandel, a molasses distiller who operated a plant at the Kill Van Kull near Richmond Terrace and Westervelt Avenue, taking advantage of the Jersey Street brook. Two Native American roads intersected near the distiller: Shore Road (today&#x27;s Richmond Terrace) on the North Shore, and a road that wound southward on St. Marks Place and then Hamilton and Westervelt Avenues.

Fort Hill, one of the hills overlooking the harbor, was the location on Duxbury&#x27;s Point or Ducksberry Point, fortified by the British during the American Revolutionary War. Hessian troops, contracted by the British, were stationed near the Jersey Street brook, which then became known as Hessian Springs. After the end of the war, the area remained primarily rural through the early 19th century. The area became part of the town of Castleton upon the town&#x27;s incorporation in 1788. The New York state government took of Duxbury Glebe in 1799, upon which it established the New York Marine Hospital (also &quot;The Quarantine&quot;), a contagious disease hospital. The state then gave to the federal government for the U.S. Light-House Depot Complex, a lighthouse facility.

=== 19th century ===

==== Early ownership ====
Among the first people to promote the widespread development of Staten Island was former U.S. vice president Daniel D. Tompkins, who purchased land in the northern part of Staten Island in the early 1810s. Tompkins purchased Abraham Crocheron&#x27;s farm, located on present-day Jersey Street south of Richmond Terrace, in 1814. The next year, he acquired from St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, and two years after that, he bought Philip Van Buskirk&#x27;s land claim, located between the two disconnected pieces of land. Tompkins also incorporated the Richmond Turnpike Company to build present-day Victory Boulevard in 1816, started operating a ferry to Manhattan in 1817, and laid out the adjacent village of Tompkinsville for development between 1819 and 1821. Tompkins then expanded the Van Buskirks&#x27; old farmhouse, using it as his primary residence. He died in 1825.

Tompkins&#x27;s property within present-day St. George was sold in April 1834 to Manhattan developer Thomas E. Davis, who continued to buy land through the following year. Davis came to own all the land on Staten Island&#x27;s northeastern shore, bounded to the south by Victory Boulevard, to the west by Sailors&#x27; Snug Harbor, and to the north and east by the waterfront. He planned to develop the area into a summer retreat called New Brighton, renaming Shore Road to Richmond Terrace, and the first five Greek Revival summer bungalows were erected in 1835. Davis sold the development to a five-person syndicate for $600,000 in 1836, and the New Brighton Association was incorporated that April. The area on the northeast shore, including present-day St. George, thus came to be called New Brighton.

==== Increasing development ====
Development on the New Brighton street grid proceeded according to a plan that surveyor James Lyons had created in 1835. Streets were arranged around existing topography. When the New Brighton Association laid out streets in northeastern Staten Island, many of these roads were named after notable politicians, with such names as Hamilton Avenue, Jay Street, and Madison Street. Other streets were named after people or places that were associated with the development of the area, including Tompkins, Davis, or the Stuyvesant family (who were early investors). For instance, St. Marks Place was named after Davis&#x27;s developments on St. Marks Place in Manhattan, while Westervelt Avenue was named after Tompkins&#x27;s son-in-law. Several of these street names replaced preexisting appellations.

Work on the street grid and development of the land continued, but in March 1837, one major investor declared bankruptcy following the Panic of 1837. The same year, the Pavilion Hotel opened in a mansion along the shore, being converted from a residence. The association continued to lay out streets. However, in 1840, four of the five original New Brighton Association investors&#x27; properties were foreclosed upon. The foreclosed lots were thus repurchased by Thomas E. Davis in 1844. According to a survey conducted the following year, several streets had been laid out in modern-day St. George, including Carroll Place, Hamilton Avenue, St. Marks Place, Richmond Terrace, and numerous smaller streets. Most development was on the waterfront, where there were mansions with carriage buildings, as well as smaller homes and the Pavilion Hotel. St. Peter&#x27;s Church on Carroll Street was dedicated in 1844 as the island&#x27;s first Roman Catholic house of worship.

By the 1840s and 1850s, New Brighton began to develop into a summer resort area. In addition to the existing Pavilion, hotels in modern-day New Brighton included the Peteler (later St. Marks) Hotel, as well as the Belmont Hotel. Additionally, new houses such as Italianate villas were built, while existing Richmond Terrace mansions were expanded or received new annexes and gardens. Several greenhouses were also built in the neighborhood, particularly on the land of the merchant John C. Green, part of whose estate is now the site of Curtis High School. The silk printer John Crabtree established a printing plant for his company, Crabtree and Wilkinson, on the eastern bank of the Jersey Street brook in 1844. The factory had over 180 workers and a small residential and commercial community by 1853, and the establishment of similar factories led to the population of New Brighton doubling between 1840 and 1860.

In 1858, angry Staten Island residents burned down the Quarantine in what became known as the Staten Island Quarantine War. Three years afterward, the onset of the American Civil War resulted in large changes to the neighborhood&#x27;s land use. Initially, the local economy suffered due to cessation of trade with the Southern United States, but because of the Union Army&#x27;s demand for material, many entrepreneurs and workers moved to New York City, including to Staten Island&#x27;s North Shore. According to a 1865 article from the &quot;Richmond County Gazette&quot;, &quot;the demand for dwelling houses upon the island has never before been equalled.&quot; During this time, many new houses were designed in the Second Empire style and/or as duplexes, particularly on as-yet-undeveloped plots along Westervelt Avenue or St. Marks Place. The end of the Civil War, cheaper building materials, and technological improvements resulted in an increase in real estate prices on the North Shore, and by the early 1870s, the area was described as being prosperous, with real estate in high demand.

The Panic of 1873 resulted in a near-cessation of building activity on the North Shore. By the late 1870s, industries had started to move to the area again, such as J. B. King and Company, whose plaster mill opened in 1877. A water system was established upon the Staten Island Water Supply Company&#x27;s 1879 incorporation, and a sewage system was added between 1884 and 1890.

==== Renaming and late 19th century ====
In the 1880s, the area closest to the ferry terminals on the northeastern shore became known as &quot;St. George&quot;, after developer George Law, who acquired rights to the New Brighton waterfront at bargain prices. According to island historians Charles Leng and William T. Davis, the businessman Erastus Wiman, who was expanding the Staten Island Railway to New Brighton, promised to &quot;canonize&quot; Law if the latter agreed to relinquish the land rights for a new railroad–ferry terminal there. St. George was selected for the terminal due to the site being the closest point from Staten Island to Manhattan, approximately a distance. The St. George Terminal opened in early 1886. It was served by a Staten Island Ferry route to Manhattan&#x27;s Whitehall Terminal, as well as three routes of the Staten Island Railway: the North Shore Branch to Elm Park station (later to New Jersey), the East Shore Branch to Tottenville station, and the South Beach Branch to South Beach station.

With the completion of the Staten Island Railway, Wiman&#x27;s Staten Island Amusement Company started operating locations in both St. George and Erastina (now Mariners Harbor). The St. George location opened in 1886 and included an illuminated fountain, as well as public events and competitions, a 60-piece military band, and the St. George Cricket Grounds. The fountain was removed from the site by 1887, and the amusements in St. George ceased to exist by 1889. The grandest and last hotel of St. George and New Brighton was the Hotel Castleton, built in 1889 and destroyed by fire in 1907.

The completion of new transportation options also resulted in further real estate development, especially around the areas close to New Brighton and St. George stations. Developers such as John M. Pendleton and Anson Phelps Stokes constructed cottages and houses in the northern part of St. George, while existing property owners expanded their properties. Many newer houses, meanwhile, were designed in the Queen Anne, Shingle, and Colonial Revival styles. In 1898, Staten Island was consolidated with New York City, and this move accelerated development of the region. At this time immigrant groups settled in New Brighton in greater numbers; Italians and African-Americans along the Kill Van Kull, and Jewish communities on the eastern boundary of the village near St. George and Tompkinsville. George Cromwell, the first Staten Island borough president following the unification of New York City, decided to move the Richmond county capital from Richmondtown to St. George, citing its convenience to Manhattan.

=== 20th century ===

==== Post-unification development ====
In the years after unification, the North Shore became quickly urbanized, and the political and economic center of Staten Island shifted to the region. Development of St. George turned mostly to residential and commercial uses by the 1900s. Several government buildings were also built in the area because of Cromwell&#x27;s decision to make St. George the primary civic center for Staten Island. The area&#x27;s first secondary school, Curtis High School, opened in 1904. The ferry service to Whitehall Terminal was transferred to municipal operation the following year. Subsequently, St. George became more urbanized due to easy access to the ferry, and because of its consolidation with New York City. By 1912, electric streetlights were being installed, and various commercial and government buildings were being erected in St. George. Other city services were also brought to Staten Island following unification, such as schools, emergency facilities, new roads, and utilities including an underground water supply.

The architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings developed several buildings in St. George, including the St. George Library Center of the New York Public Library (1907), the present Staten Island Borough Hall (1906), and the Richmond County Courthouse (1919). The Staten Island Museum moved to its present location in the neighborhood in 1918. The 120th Police Precinct building on Richmond Terrace was finished in 1923, resulting in the consolidation of three former New York City Police Department precincts on the North Shore. Other notable buildings developed in St. George during the 1920s and 1930s include the St. George Theatre (1927), the Staten Island Federal Office Building (1931), the Richmond County Family Court (1931), and the Staten Island Savings Bank (1936). Development of buildings in St. George increased following World War I, with one person stating that Stuyvesant Place &quot;look[ed] like a ravine&quot; due to the pace of new residential construction. &quot;The New York Herald&quot; said in 1919 that &quot;In St. George are excellent public and private schools as well as churches, stores and modern apartment buddings.&quot;

The Staten Island Tunnel, a railroad/rapid transit tunnel to Brooklyn, was proposed in 1912 in conjunction with the Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. It was hoped that the completion of the tunnel would spur the development of inner Staten Island and St. George, as a trip to Manhattan via the tunnel was expected to take only 12 to 15 minutes, compared to 25 on the ferry. However, after several delays and a groundbreaking in 1923, the project was canceled in 1925. Another plan for an expanded ferry terminal with a 26-story office complex was proposed in 1930, but never built.

==== Later 20th century ====
As early as 1919, &quot;St. George&quot; was used to describe the northeastern waterfront of Staten island as well as the hills immediately adjacent to the ferry terminal. By the 1930s, the &quot;St. George&quot; name had come to generally describe the northeastern corner of Staten Island, including what was formerly known as New Brighton. Around this time, many of the older housing stock in St. George were converted to small apartment buildings. The U.S. Light-House Depot Complex was turned over to the United States Coast Guard in 1936. After a fire burned down the St. George Terminal in 1946, a rebuilt terminal opened in 1951 with a parking lot, new ferry slips, and improved connections to buses and the railroad.

By the 1960s, office space was being developed around Bay Street. The opening of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964 created a connection between Staten Island and the rest of New York City that did not require passing through St. George, and led to the development of neighborhoods further inland. Furthermore, the Coast Guard complex closed in 1965, its operations being moved to Governors Island. By the 1970s, there was a decline in demand for St. George&#x27;s residential stock. Only one project was completed on the North Shore waterfront in that decade, a 440-unit apartment building near the ferry terminal. Developer William Zeckendorf and materials company Alcoa had jointly proposed a 27-story residential complex on the waterfront about south of the terminal, replacing ten industrial buildings formerly used by the American Dock Company. However, the site remained unused until 1981, when construction started on a smaller development called the Bay Street Landing. Further inland, St. George was mostly composed of single-family housing situated amid the area&#x27;s steep topography and winding roads. Several parcels, such as the former Daniel Low Terrace, lay undeveloped.

=== Revival ===
The community underwent a revival starting in the late 1980s, when a group of developers proposed the St. George Seaport at Brighton, a $750 million retail and commercial complex based on Manhattan&#x27;s South Street Seaport. Redevelopment of the area continued through the 1990s. In 1994, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the St. George Historic District, which includes 78 houses and St. Peter&#x27;s Church. The Brighton Heights Reformed Church, a city and national landmark in St. George, burned down in 1996 and was rebuilt three years later. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, younger families were starting to move to St. George, since housing in the neighborhood was cheaper compared to in the rest of the city.

In the first decade of the 21st century, several prominent structures in St. George were renovated or opened. The first of these was Richmond County Bank Ballpark (now named SIUH Community Park) which opened in 2001 along with an adjacent waterfront promenade. This was followed by the reopening of the St. George Theater in 2004, the opening of the Postcards 9/11 memorial in 2004, and the renovation of the ferry terminal in 2005. By the mid-2000s, new development was starting to cluster on the waterfront near the ferry terminal. In 2007, several media reports noted that artists and musicians were moving to Staten Island&#x27;s North Shore so they could be near Manhattan but afford more space to live and work. However, residential development slowed following the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Further improvements came to St. George in 2008 when a zoning district called the Special St. George District was designated by the New York City Department of City Planning. The following year, Pier 1 was renovated to create a public space with a fishing pier.

Development on the shore and on Bay Street continued through the 2010s. The National Lighthouse Museum opened in 2015, and the Empire Outlets mall opened in May 2019. Another large project to draw visitors to St. George, the New York Wheel, was canceled in 2018 over delays and rising costs. Lighthouse Point, located south of St. George Terminal, was expected to open in late 2019, but was delayed shortly before completion.

== Demographics ==

For census purposes, the New York City government classifies St. George as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called West New Brighton-New Brighton-St. George. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of West New Brighton-New Brighton-St. George was 33,551, a change of 1,397 (4.2%) from the 32,154 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 26.4% (8,859) White, 31.7% (10,630) African American, 0.3% (100) Native American, 5% (1,691) Asian, 0% (10) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (123) from other races, and 2.5% (835) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 33.7% (11,303) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 1, which comprises St. George and other neighborhoods on the North Shore, had 181,484 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.0 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 24% are between the ages of between 0–17, 27% between 25 and 44, and 26% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 13% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 1 was $48,018, though the median income in St. George individually was $46,646. In 2018, an estimated 21% of St. George and the North Shore residents lived in poverty, compared to 17% in all of Staten Island and 20% in all of New York City. One in fourteen residents (7%) were unemployed, compared to 6% in Staten Island and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 51% in St. George and the North Shore, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 49% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , St. George and the North Shore are considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

== Buildings and structures ==

=== Government structures ===

St. George contains several structures that serve judicial or executive functions for the Staten Island borough government. The Staten Island Borough Hall, at 2–10 Richmond Terrace, was built in 1906 and was designed by Carrère and Hastings in the French Renaissance style. Adjacent to it is the former Richmond County Courthouse at 12–24 Richmond Terrace, built in 1919 and also designed by Carrère and Hastings, though in the Neoclassical style. One block northwest is the Richmond County Family Court, originally the Staten Island Family Courthouse, a Neoclassical structure at 100 Richmond Terrace designed by Sibley &amp; Fetherston and completed in 1931. A structure for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, designed in the Art Deco style, is located on Hamilton Avenue. The present Richmond County Supreme Court, at 26 Central Avenue, opened in 2015 after more than a decade of construction and planning.

The United States Coast Guard operated the Office Building and U.S. Light-House Depot Complex until 1965. It was the major center for lighthouse supply, maintenance and experimentation for nearly 150 years. The site consists of of waterfront property with five historic USLHS buildings, a public plaza and an pier.

Additionally, the Staten Island Federal Office Building at 45 Bay Street is an Art Deco limestone building completed in 1931. It includes the neighborhood&#x27;s post office. The Staten Island Savings Bank at 13-15 Hyatt Street was built in 1936 in the Federal style.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has designated the Staten Island Borough Hall, Richmond County Courthouse, Richmond County Family Court, and the Office Building of the U.S. Coast Guard Station as official city landmarks. The Staten Island Borough Hall. Richmond County Courthouse, and USCG Station office building were also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

=== Religious structures ===
The Brighton Heights Reformed Church, located at 320 St. Marks Place, was protected as a NRHP site and as a city landmark in 1982 and 1967, respectively. The original church burned down in an accidental fire in 1996 and was rebuilt in 1999. St. Peter&#x27;s Church on Carroll Street, dedicated in 1844, was the island&#x27;s first Roman Catholic house of worship. It remains one of Staten Island&#x27;s most historically important churches, with more than half of the island&#x27;s Catholic churches having been derived from St. Peter&#x27;s parish.

=== Houses ===
The Fort Hill area comprises the remains of the streets and homes where the descendants of the Tompkins, Westervelt, and Low families lived. The area included the mansions of Daniel D. Tompkins, Anson Phelps-Stokes, and Daniel Low. Another prominent landowner was August Belmont, whose name is enshrined in Belmont Place. Many of the houses remaining today represent the homes and summer homes of the Low-Tompkins extended family and friends. The residential Fort Hill area includes many examples of Victorian, Tudor, Shingle style, and Art Deco architecture, in addition to one house modeled after a Spanish castle. On the waterfront, there are two Greek Revival houses on St. George&#x27;s waterfront, at 404 and 272 Richmond Terrace. These are the last remnants of a &quot;Temple Row&quot; that existed on the waterfront in the mid-19th century.

There are also several apartment buildings in St. George. The Ambassador Apartments, built in 1932 in the Art Deco style, is located at 30 Daniel Low Terrace. The 20-story Castleton Park Apartments, at 165-185 St. Marks Place, are estimated to be the tallest buildings on Staten Island.

The August and Augusta Schoverling House, Vanderzee-Harper House and four of the &quot;Horton&#x27;s Row&quot; houses at 411–417 Westervelt Avenue are designated as official city landmarks. A part of the neighborhood is located in the St. George/New Brighton Historic District, designated in 1994. The historic district consists of 78 houses as well as St. Peter&#x27;s Church. The houses are in a mix of Victorian styles, such as Queen Anne, Shingle style, Colonial Revival, and Tudor.

== Attractions ==
The Hyatt Street side of a municipal parking lot faces the St. George Theatre. This part of the lot is noted for the greenmarket held on it during spring, summer and fall. The lot encompasses a paved-over graveyard of the former quarantine hospital, whose remains were reburied nearby.

=== Entertainment and shopping ===

The 2,800-seat St. George Theatre is located on Hyatt Street at the intersection with Central Avenue. The theater hosts a variety of activities, including educational programs, architectural tours, television and film shoots, concerts, comedy, and Broadway touring companies. The theater was built for Staten Island theater operator Solomon Brill and opened in 1929. Eugene De Rosa was the St. George Theatre&#x27;s main architect, and was assisted by Staten Island resident James Whitford, while the ornate Spanish and Italian Baroque interior of the St. George Theatre was designed by Nestor Castro. The theatre was renovated in 2004. The upper stories are used as office floors.

The SIUH Community Park (formerly named Richmond County Bank Ballpark) located on the waterfront was home of the Staten Island Yankees, a minor league farm club of the New York Yankees from 2001 to 2020. It is now home to the Staten Island FerryHawks of the independent Atlantic League. The 7,171-seat stadium opened in 2001.

Empire Outlets, an outlet mall in St. George, opened in May 2019. The mall is located next to the site of the New York Wheel, a tall giant Ferris wheel that was canceled in 2018. The two projects initially went through the approval process simultaneously and shared consultants on issues such as traffic and the waterfront, but were separate projects with separate funding.

=== Museums and memorials ===
The Staten Island Museum building, built in St. George in 1927 with an addition in 1999, is located at Wall Street and Stuyvesant Place two blocks northwest of the St. George Terminal. The museum explores the arts, natural science, and local history of the island.

In 1998, planning started for the National Lighthouse Museum, dedicated to the history of the United States Lighthouse Service. After several delays due to a lack of funds, the museum opened in 2015, within Building 12 of the USLHS/US Coast Guard depot.

The St. George waterfront is the location of &quot;Postcards&quot;, a September 11 memorial that opened in 2004. The memorial includes two white marble wing sculptures, each standing high, which represent large postcards to loved ones.

* Curtis High School (grades 9–12); the first high school on Staten Island, it is a city landmark

=== Library ===
The New York Public Library (NYPL)&#x27;s St. George Library Center is located at 5 Central Avenue, across from Staten Island&#x27;s Borough Hall and County Courthouse. The St. George Library Center, Staten Island&#x27;s main library, was built in 1906–1907; it was designed by Carrère and Hastings in the Georgian Revival style. The branch contains three stories, including a basement. The first floor contains the main reading room, while the second floor contains a children&#x27;s collection, and the lower level contains a collection for young adults.

== Transportation ==
St. George Terminal is a ferry, railway, bus, and park and ride complex at Richmond Terrace and Bay Street. Opened in 1886, it was renovated multiple times, most recently in 2005. The renovated terminal has panoramic views of the harbor and incoming ferries.

St. George Terminal is served by nearly all Staten Island bus routes, except for the , as well as the Staten Island Railway and the Staten Island Ferry. Additionally, St. George is also served by the NYC Ferry&#x27;s St. George route.

== Telephone exchange ==
In 1924, the &quot;Saint George&quot; telephone exchange was established in the new North Staten Island building of New York Telephone, one of the island&#x27;s five such exchanges. It became &quot;SAint George 7&quot; when New York City&#x27;s service underwent a major upgrade six years later. This three-digit prefix, now identified by numbers as &quot;727&quot;, is the last of the five pre-upgrade exchanges still in service. Due to the abbreviation of &quot;Saint&quot; in the name of &quot;Saint George&quot;, some historic telephone books such as those of the NYPD mistakenly gave the exchange as &quot;ST. George 7&quot;, which directed the caller to an exchange in Manhattan.

== Notable people ==
* Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward, both actors, lived in the Ambassador, an Art Deco apartment building on Daniel Low Terrace between Crescent Avenue and Fort Hill Circle, in their early days in film.
* Actor Martin Sheen lived in the Ambassador building, and his son Emilio Estevez was born there.
* Max Rose, Democratic congressman for New York&#x27;s 11th congressional district from 2018 to 2020, lives in St. George .

<text>Londer Tsaava () was the chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers in Exile, which forms part of the Georgian government-in-exile now based in Kodori, Georgia. In this capacity, he served as the government-in-exile&#x27;s second highest-ranking official, and also had a period as &quot;de facto&quot; leader.
He has been a strong advocate of Abkhazian reunification with Georgia. In this capacity, he presented a petition of 200,000 signatures to the United Nations Security Council from Georgians demanding the withdrawal of the current peacekeeping force.

In late 2003, a group of Georgian veterans of the war with Abkhazia began a hunger strike in Tbilisi, demanding the resignation of both Tamaz Nadareishvili, leader of the government-in-exile, and Tsaava. Though Nadareishvili was forced to resign, Tsaava managed to retain his position. Around the same time, Tsaava was involved in negotiations with a group of Georgian refugees from Abkhazia that had taken hostages. He was eventually successful in securing their release, which may have been a factor in his survival as chairman.

He was eventually replaced by Irakli Alasania.

<text>The LCM-8 (&quot;Mike Boat&quot;) is a river boat and mechanized landing craft used by the United States Navy and Army during the Vietnam War and subsequent operations. They are currently used by governments and private organizations throughout the world. The acronym stands for &quot;Landing Craft Mechanized, Mark 8&quot;. (The &quot;Mike Boat&quot; term refers to the military phonetic alphabet, LCM being &quot;Lima Charlie Mike&quot;.)

The vessel weighs 135,000 pounds (61,200 kg) and has a crew of four: a Boatswain&#x27;s Mate petty officer, an Engineman petty officer, a non-rated fireman, and a seaman. US Army specifications call for a crew of six during 24-hour operations: two coxswains, two seamen and two enginemen. The LCM-8s are constructed from welded steel and powered by four 6-71 or two 12V71 diesel engines, twin propellers, and rudders. The ship can carry 60 short tons of cargo. It was designed by Marinette Marine Corp. It has a range of 190 miles at 9 knots with a full load.

== Modifications==
A modified version, the Zippo boat, carries flamethrowers. Another modified version, the LCM-8 Mod 2, was used to fulfill command, personnel, salvage, and firefighting functions. There is also another version with an aluminum hull. This version was carried aboard all of the Charleston class LKA ships, as the steel version was too heavy to be lifted by the ship&#x27;s 40 ton fore and aft booms, preventing more than two from being lowered (via the two 70 ton fore and aft cargo booms) at one time. They are now mostly carried by pre-positioned ships.

A third modification was as a transport for PBRs (patrol boat, river) from repair stations at Da Nang (YR-71) and Tan My (PBR Mobile Base 1) to outlying points at Cua Viet, and the Cua Dai rivers. PBR main propulsion jet pumps were easily damaged by ocean salt water which necessitated the boats being carried by another craft to their duty stations. These transport LCMs were classed as mini-docks and each had a boat ramp in the well deck. The voids (built-in float chambers under the well deck) would be systematically flooded, allowing the front end of the craft to sink, so a PBR could be floated in or out of the well deck. The pumping mechanism would then be reversed to clear the water out of the voids, restoring the craft to the normal floating position.

A fourth modification was the Army Version for Vietnam Rivers Logistic with a liveaboard cabin and crewed by six men consisting of Coxswain, Assist. Coxswain, Engineer and assistant and two deckhands. All crew could handle the two M2 Browning .50 caliber machine gun turrets and other small arms and were frequently engaged by the Vietcong on the rivers and canals of the Mekong Delta. One unit, an Army Reserve Unit out of St. Petersburg, Florida, was called to active duty in 1968-69 received a Unit Commendation of merit for delivering record tonnage in their 12-month tour.

== U.S. usage ==
They were used by the United States Navy and Army during the Vietnam War. During the Vietnam War, there were two new aluminum LCM-8s on Johnston Island, which carried trucks and cargo between islands, and one being used as a rescue boat. They had the newer fluid shift transmissions, and 2-671&#x27;s paired up to two props.

In I Corps (the northernmost military district in Vietnam) boats based at Da Nang, Tan My and Cửa Việt had three man crews of various rates and ranks. On U.S. Navy boats, the senior rate was usually a third-class petty officer or above, and the two crewmen could be E-2, E-3 or E-4 ranks (i.e. seaman apprentice, seaman, or petty officer third class). One of the two crewmen was almost always an Engineman and could be an ENFA, ENFN, or an EN3 in rank. The LCM-8s there all had two sets of the twin 6-71 Detroits paired up to a hydro transmission. Two air compressors, port and starboard of the engine sets, provided air pressure to operate the air cylinders that raised and lowered the bow ramp. The air cylinders were below deck in the eighth void from the bow and stretched cables attached to the ramp to raise it. Lowering the ramp was accomplished by releasing the air and allowing gravity to bring the ramp down.

They also saw use during Operation Just Cause in Panama as well as Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Three Army LCM-8s served in the 1992–1993 US mission to Somalia (fictionalized in Christian Bauman&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;The Ice Beneath You&quot;, which is set in part on a US Army LCM-8 near Kismaayo, Somalia), and a platoon of LCM-8s from the 1098th Trans Co. deployed to Port-au-Prince for the Haitian invasion (1994). The United States Army Reserve&#x27;s 464th Transportation Company assisted the United States Coast Guard in patrolling the Potomac River after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.

Some are currently deployed aboard Maritime Prepositioning ships to facilitate their mission of being able to unload all their cargo while still offshore with no outside assistance.

===Replacement===
The U.S. Army plans to replace the LCM-8 with the Maneuver Support Vessel (Light) (MSV(L)). Two dozen boats are planned that will be larger and faster, with a longer range and twice the capacity over Mike Boats. The MSV(L) will be roughly long, with a draft of less than four feet, a speed of 18 knots and the capacity to carry either an M1 Abrams tank, two Strykers with add-on armor, or four Joint Light Tactical Vehicles. It also may be used in defended waters, being fitted with a subsurface surveillance device, protection from small arms fire, two Common Remotely Operated Weapon Stations, and mitigated detection through reduction of thermal and acoustic signature. Testing of the new vessel is to take place until 2019. In September 2017, Vigor Shipyards was awarded a nearly $1 billion contract for the MSV(L), which is planned for completion in 2027.

==Australian service==
The LCM-8 was constructed in Australia for the Australian Army from 1965 to 1967 and again in 1972 using a heavily modified design, crewed (four) and administered by the Royal Australian Corps of Transport and one engineer from the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RAEME). The modification of the vessels included an extended enclosed wheelhouse with full galley facilities, chart table and storage space to aid in extended operations beyond the original design parameters. A water purification system allows the vessels to be somewhat independent for longer periods of time. A fully functioning toilet (head) and shower are also installed as part of the wheelhouse extensions; external provision for bedding is also included for the full crew complement.

The extension of the wheelhouse increased rigidity of the craft leading to excessive vibration and cavitation with the original three-blade propeller. Further development included a more balanced and expensive five-blade propeller, negating the vibration and cavitation of the original. The prop change found a few negative effects in the beaching performance of the vessel but over time tactics have been changed to suit the new system.

The vessels are also installed with a full suite of electronics allowing the craft to navigate in all weather, day or night in military operations anywhere in the world with little to no special training requirements for an indefinite period.

During the mid-1990s, the Army LCM-8 received a life of type extension with a re-engine program. The original twin-pac 6-71 two-stroke Detroit Diesel engines and Allison mechanical transmissions were replaced with 8v-92 Silver Series Detroit Diesel engines and Allison Hydraulic Transmissions thus extending the life of the craft for another 20 years.

Two craft were utilized during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, patrolling the shallow waters of the Khawr Abd Allah estuary using as their base of operations. They were extensively used in East Timor for logistic operations in direct support of multinational peace keepers. Other deployments include peacekeeping and peace monitoring operations in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands.

The LCM-8 fleet of fifteen was to be replaced by six Australian designed type LCM2000 waterjet propelled craft, however these craft were scrapped, after not meeting the required in-service specifications and being deemed not fit for use for the intended &quot;Kanimbla&quot;-class. The Army will now continue to operate the LCM-8 until 2027. A new project which aims to replace the Army&#x27;s LCM-8 landing craft was initiated in early 2021.

<text>The New Kingdom, also called the Egyptian Empire, refers to ancient Egypt between the 16th century BC and the 11th century BC. This period of ancient Egyptian history covers the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth dynasties. Through radiocarbon dating, the establishment of the New Kingdom has been placed between 1570 BC and 1544 BC. The New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period and was succeeded by the Third Intermediate Period. It was the most prosperous time for the Egyptian people and marked the peak of Egypt&#x27;s power.

In 1845, the concept of a &quot;New Kingdom&quot; as one of three &quot;golden ages&quot; was coined by German scholar Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen; the original definition would evolve significantly throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The later part of this period, under the Nineteenth Dynasty (1295–1189 BC) and the Twentieth Dynasty (1189–1069 BC), is also known as the &quot;Ramesside period&quot;. It is named after the eleven pharaohs who took the name Ramesses, after Ramesses I, who founded the Nineteenth Dynasty, and his grandson Ramesses II, who was its longest-reigning monarch.

Possibly as a result of the foreign rule of the Hyksos during the Second Intermediate Period, the New Kingdom saw a historic expansion into the Levant, thus marking Egypt&#x27;s greatest territorial extent. Similarly, in response to attacks by the Kushites, who led raids into Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, the rulers of the New Kingdom felt compelled to expand far into Nubia and to hold wider territories in the Near East, particularly on the Levantine frontier.

==History==
===Rise===

The Eighteenth Dynasty included some of Egypt&#x27;s most famous kings, including Ahmose I, Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Amenhotep III, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun.

Ahmose I is viewed to be the founder of the eighteenth dynasty. He continued the campaigns of his father Seqenenre Tao and of Kamose against the Hyksos until he reunified the country once more. Ahmose would then continue to campaign in the Levant, the home of the Hyksos, to prevent any future invasions on Egypt.

Ahmose was followed by Amenhotep I, who campaigned in Nubia and was followed by Thutmose I. Thutmose I campaigned in the Levant and reached as far as the Euphrates, thus becoming the first pharaoh to cross the river. During this campaign, the Syrian princes declared allegiance to Thutmose. However, after he returned, they discontinued tribute and began fortifying against future incursions.

Hatshepsut was one of the most powerful pharaohs of this dynasty. She was the daughter of Thutmose I and the royal wife of Thutmose II. Upon the death of her husband, she ruled jointly with his son by a minor wife, Thutmose III, who had ascended to the throne as a child of about two years of age, but eventually she ruled in her own right as king. Hatshepsut built extensively in the Karnak temple in Luxor and throughout all of Egypt and she re-established the trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos rule of Lower Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, thereby building the wealth of the Eighteenth Dynasty. She oversaw the preparations and funding for a mission to the Land of Punt. After her death, having gained valuable experience heading up the military for Hatshepsut, Thutmose III assumed rule.

Thutmose III expanded Egypt&#x27;s army and wielded it with great success to consolidate the empire created by his predecessors. This resulted in a peak in Egypt&#x27;s power and wealth during the reign of Amenhotep III. The term pharaoh, originally the name of the king&#x27;s palace, became a form of address for the person who was king during his reign (–1425 BC).

Widely considered a military genius by historians, Thutmose III conducted at least 16 campaigns in 20 years. He was an active expansionist ruler. He is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates to Nubia during seventeen known military campaigns. He was the first pharaoh after Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates, doing so during his campaign against Mitanni. He continued north through the territory belonging to the still unconquered cities of Aleppo and Carchemish and quickly crossed the Euphrates in his boats, taking the Mitannian king entirely by surprise.

The wealthiest of all the kings of this dynasty is Amenhotep III, who built the Luxor Temple, the Precinct of Monthu at Karnak and his massive Mortuary Temple. Amenhotep III also built the Malkata palace, the largest built in Egypt.

One of the best-known eighteenth dynasty pharaohs is Amenhotep IV, who changed his name to Akhenaten in honour of the Aten, a representation of the Egyptian god, Ra. His worship of the Aten as his personal deity is often interpreted as history&#x27;s first instance of monotheism. Akhenaten&#x27;s wife, Nefertiti, contributed a great deal to his new direction in the Egyptian religion. Nefertiti was bold enough to perform rituals to Aten. Akhenaten&#x27;s religious fervour is cited as the reason why he and his wife were subsequently written out of Egyptian history. Under his reign, in the fourteenth century BC, Egyptian art flourished in a distinctive new style (see Amarna Period).

By the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Egypt&#x27;s status had changed radically. Aided by Akhenaten&#x27;s apparent lack of interest in international affairs, the Hittites had gradually extended their influence into the Levant to become a major power in international politics—a power that both Seti I and his son Ramesses II would confront during the nineteenth Dynasty.

The last two members of the Eighteenth Dynasty—Ay and Horemheb—became rulers from the ranks of officials in the royal court, although Ay might also have been the maternal uncle of Akhenaten and a fellow descendant of Yuya and Tjuyu.

Ay may have married the widowed Great Royal Wife and young half-sister of Tutankhamun, Ankhesenamun, in order to obtain power; she did not live long afterward. Ay then married Tey, who originally had been wet-nurse to Nefertiti.

Ay&#x27;s reign was short. His successor was Horemheb, a general during the reign of Tutankhamun, whom the pharaoh may have intended as his successor in the event that he had no surviving children, which came to pass. Horemheb may have taken the throne away from Ay in a coup d&#x27;état. Although Ay&#x27;s son or stepson Nakhtmin was named as his father or stepfather&#x27;s Crown Prince, Nakhtmin seems to have died during the reign of Ay, leaving the opportunity for Horemheb to claim the throne next.

Horemheb also died without surviving children, having appointed his vizier, Pa-ra-mes-su, as his heir. This vizier ascended the throne in 1292 BC as Ramesses I, and was the first pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty.
===Height of power===

The Nineteenth Dynasty was founded by the Vizier Ramesses I, whom the last ruler of the eighteenth dynasty, Pharaoh Horemheb, had chosen as his successor. His brief reign marked a transition period between the reign of Horemheb and the powerful pharaohs of this dynasty, in particular, his son Seti I and grandson Ramesses II, who would bring Egypt to new heights of imperial power.

Seti I fought a series of wars in western Asia, Libya, and Nubia in the first decade of his reign. The main source for knowledge of Seti&#x27;s military activities are his battle scenes on the north exterior wall of the Karnak Hypostyle Hall, along with several royal stelas with inscriptions mentioning battles in Canaan and Nubia. The greatest achievement of Seti I&#x27;s foreign policy was the capture of the Syrian town of Kadesh and neighboring territory of Amurru from the Hittite Empire. Egypt had not held Kadesh since the time of Akhenaten. Seti I was successful in defeating a Hittite army that tried to defend the town and erected a victory stela at the site which has been found by archaeologists. Kadesh, however, soon reverted to Hittite control because the Egyptians did not or could not maintain a permanent military occupation of Kadesh and Amurru which were close to the Hittite homelands.

Ramesses II sought to recover territories in the Levant that had been held by the 18th Dynasty. In his second year, before confronting the Hittites, Ramesses II had to deal with a raid by the Sherden sea people whom he defeated and incorporated into his army. His campaigns against the Hittites culminated in the Battle of Kadesh, where he led Egyptian armies against those of the Hittite king Muwatalli II. Ramesses was caught in history&#x27;s first recorded military ambush, although he was able to rally his troops and turn the tide of battle against the Hittites thanks to the arrival of the Ne&#x27;arin (possibly mercenaries in the employ of Egypt). The outcome of the battle was undecided, with both sides claiming victory at their home front, and ultimately resulting in a peace treaty between the two governments.
He campaigned later in the Levant capturing Edom and Moab. New kingdom Egyptian stelae from this period have been found in Jordan. Later, Egyptians conquered Qatna and Tunip where a statue of Ramses II was erected. Thus he recaptured Qadesh and northern Amurru. Nevertheless, like Seti I, he found that he could not permanently hold territory so far from base and after years of conflict, a peace treaty was concluded between the two states. Egypt was able to obtain wealth and stability under the rule of Ramesses, for more than half a century. His immediate successors continued the military campaigns, although an increasingly troubled court—which at one point put a usurper (Amenmesse) on the throne—made it increasingly difficult for a pharaoh to effectively retain control of the territories.

Ramesses II built extensively throughout Egypt and Nubia, and his cartouches are prominently displayed, even in buildings that he did not construct. There are accounts of his honor hewn on stone, statues, and the remains of palaces and temples—most notably the Ramesseum in western Thebes and the rock temples of Abu Simbel. He covered the land from the Delta to Nubia with buildings in a way no king before him had. He also founded a new capital city in the Delta during his reign, called Pi-Ramesses. It previously had served as a summer palace during the reign of Seti I.

Ramesses II constructed many large monuments, including the archaeological complex of Abu Simbel, and the Mortuary temple known as the Ramesseum. He built on a monumental scale to ensure that his legacy would survive the ravages of time. Ramesses used art as a means of propaganda for his victories over foreigners, which are depicted on numerous temple reliefs. Ramesses II erected more colossal statues of himself than any other pharaoh, and also usurped many existing statues by inscribing his own cartouche on them. 

Ramesses II was also famed for the huge number of children he sired by his various wives and concubines; the tomb he built for his sons (many of whom he outlived) in the Valley of the Kings has proven to be the largest funerary complex in Egypt.

====Civil war====
The immediate successors of Ramesses II continued the military campaigns although an increasingly troubled court complicated matters. He was succeeded by his son Merneptah and then by Merneptah&#x27;s son Seti II. Seti II&#x27;s right to the throne seems to have been disputed by his half-brother Amenmesse, who may have temporarily ruled from Thebes.

Upon his death, Seti II&#x27;s son Siptah, who may have been afflicted with poliomyelitis during his life, was appointed to the throne by Bay, a chancellor and a West Asian commoner who served as vizier behind the scenes. Siptah died early and throne was assumed by Twosret, who was the royal wife of his father and, possibly, his uncle Amenmesse&#x27;s sister.

A period of anarchy at the end of Twosret&#x27;s short reign saw the enthronement of Setnakhte, establishing the Twentieth Dynasty.

===Final years===

The last &quot;great&quot; pharaoh from the New Kingdom is widely considered to be Ramesses III, a Twentieth Dynasty pharaoh who reigned several decades after Ramesses II.

In the eighth year of his reign, the Sea Peoples invaded Egypt by land and sea. Ramesses III defeated them in two great land and sea battles (the Battle of Djahy and the Battle of the Delta). He incorporated them as subject peoples and is thought to have settled them in Southern Canaan, although there is evidence that they forced their way into Canaan. Their presence in Canaan may have contributed to the formation of new states, such as Philistia, in this region after the collapse of the Egyptian Empire (In the reign of Ramses III himself, Egyptian presence in the Levant is still attested as far as Byblos). He later was compelled to fight invading Libyan tribesmen in two major campaigns in Egypt&#x27;s Western Delta in his sixth year and eleventh year respectively.

The heavy cost of this warfare slowly drained Egypt&#x27;s treasury and contributed to the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The severity of the difficulties is indicated by the fact that the first known labour strike in recorded history occurred during the twenty-ninth year of Ramesses III&#x27;s reign. At that time, the food rations for Egypt&#x27;s favoured and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of Deir el Medina could not be provisioned. Air pollution limited the amount of sunlight penetrating the atmosphere, affecting agricultural production and arresting global tree growth for almost two full decades, until 1140 BC. One proposed cause is the Hekla 3 eruption of the Hekla volcano in Iceland, but the dating of this remains disputed.

Near the end of Ramesses III&#x27;s reign, one of his secondary wives plotted to assassinate the king in her quest to place her son on the throne. Palace personnel, the harem, government officials, and army officers participated in the plot. A special court of 12 judges was formed to try the defendants who were sentenced to death. Written sources show that the coup failed and that the conspirators were successfully tried. However, it is not clear from the documents whether Ramses survived the assassination attempt. The king&#x27;s mummy showed no visible wounds, and questions about his fate were left open to speculation for many years. In 2012, researchers announced that a CT scan had revealed a deep knife wound in the mummy&#x27;s throat, indicating that Ramesses was indeed killed by the conspirators. He died in Thebes in the 32nd year of his reign and was succeeded by Crown Prince Ramesses IV.

A number of raids by the Libyans and the Sea Peoples, more dangerous than those during the reign of Ramses III, drew the kingdom to more weakness. This increased the influence of the priests of Amon, which finally led to control of the throne by the great priests. 

====Decline into the Third Intermediate Period====
Ramesses III&#x27;s death was followed by years of bickering among his heirs. Three of his sons ascended the throne successively as Ramesses IV, Rameses VI, and Rameses VIII. Egypt was increasingly beset by droughts, below-normal flooding of the Nile, famine, civil unrest, and corruption of officials. The power of the last pharaoh of the dynasty, Ramesses XI, grew so weak that in the south the High Priests of Amun at Thebes became the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Upper Egypt, and Smendes controlled Lower Egypt in the north, even before Rameses XI&#x27;s death. Smendes eventually founded the twenty-first dynasty at Tanis.

<doc id="585061" wikidata="Q482466" url="?curid=585061" title="Maria-sama ga Miteru">
<text>, often shortened to , is a Japanese light novel series written by with illustrations by Reine Hibiki. Originally written as a short story in 1997, Shueisha published 37 light novel volumes from April 1998 to April 2012. The story focuses on a group of teenage girls attending the Catholic Lillian Girls&#x27; Academy in Tokyo, Japan. Its storyline largely revolves around the lives and close relationships of the school&#x27;s student council known as the Yamayuri Council.

A manga adaptation was published by Shueisha in &quot;Margaret&quot; and its sister magazine &quot;The Margaret&quot;. Between 2004 and 2009, the series was adapted by Studio Deen into three 13-episode anime television series and a five-episode original video animation (OVA) series. The anime adaptations have been released in North America by Nozomi Entertainment under the title &quot;Maria Watches Over Us&quot;. The license was later transferred to Maiden Japan. A live-action film adaptation was released in Japan in November 2010. Several audio dramas and music albums were also published.

&quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; received generally positive reviews by critics. It has been described as representative of &quot;yuri&quot; novels, and has been credited with starting &quot;the modern &quot;yuri&quot; trend,&quot; in addition to reviving the Class S genre. Critics have praised the series for its strong characterization, even among peripheral characters, and for its emphasis on romance and emotion over sexuality. The dramatization, however, has been criticized as being overly dramatic at times, but the lack of malicious characters has been described as reducing the chance for more drama. The extensive use of French titles has also been criticized as being distracting and initially difficult to follow. Over 5.4 million copies of the light novels have been published.

==Plot==
===Setting and themes===
The setting for &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; is , a fictional Catholic school founded in 1901 in Musashino, Tokyo, Japan; the school is depicted as an elegant, clean, pure, and very prestigious institution. Among the facilities of Lillian, aside from the classrooms, there is a church, a greenhouse, a kendo dojo, an auditorium, a park, and the Rose Mansion, where the Yamayuri Council meet. The students are very respectable and in good standing. The uniform at the school is a long, black Japanese school uniform with a white collar.

The school uses the fictional sœur system where any second- or third-year student, the &quot;grande sœur&quot; (&quot;big sister&quot;), might pick a younger girl who will become her &quot;sœur&quot; (&quot;sister&quot; in French). The &quot;grande sœur&quot; gives her the &quot;petite sœur&quot; (&quot;little sister&quot;) a rosary and promises to look after her and guide her. The basic etiquette demands the &quot;petite sœur&quot; to call her &quot;grande sœur&quot; &quot;onee-sama&quot; (&quot;older sister&quot; in Japanese). Aside from being used in prayer, the rosary is the instrument that certifies the &quot;sœur&quot; union and relationship between two students. There is an implicit code of behavior between &quot;sœurs&quot;, especially in the Yamayuri Council—the student council of the school: quietness, measure and respect towards each other; values deeply attached to traditional Japanese education.

French is occasionally used throughout the story; for example, the series is given the French subtitle &quot;La Vierge Marie vous regarde&quot;, which means &quot;The Virgin Mary is watching you&quot;. In keeping with the tone of the series, formal language is used: is a strictly formal and respectful greeting in Japanese, and is used both to greet and to bid farewell. By custom, this greeting is used often in the Lillian School; this has been one of the distinguishable and popular phrases of the series, and it is used to begin or to finish each volume. The Animax English-language version translates the word as &quot;good day to you&quot;.

The Lillian Girls&#x27; Academy uses the lily symbolism as the white lily is the flower of the Virgin Mary. The white lily is a Christian symbol of virginity and . This lily imagery is also used as a reference to yuri: the story has some elements of romance between female characters; the use of lilies reinforces this in subtext, as do the names of the student council and of the school itself. The series is only explicit about a romantic relationship once in a flashback, but many of the sisters have romantic friendships.

The musical choices of the &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; anime adaptations are generally classical music-inspired. The Christian hymn is often referred to in the series. In the context of the series, it is a children&#x27;s song taught to the students at Lillian.

===Story and characters===

&quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot;&#x27;s story revolves around the students of the Lillian Girls&#x27; Academy and is character-driven, focusing on interactions between the characters rather than any sort of ongoing plot or goal to attain. When the story begins, Yumi Fukuzawa, a first-year student at Lillian, is praying in front of the Virgin Mary statue near the school entrance when she is suddenly approached by a cold second-year student named Sachiko Ogasawara who straightens Yumi&#x27;s uniform neckerchief. This seemingly simple act of kindness stays with Yumi the rest of the day, and she speaks of her meeting with Sachiko to her friends during class and lunch.

After school is over, Yumi&#x27;s classmate Tsutako Takeshima meets with Yumi to show her that she took a photograph of Yumi&#x27;s meeting with Sachiko earlier that morning. Yumi asks if she can have the photo, but Tsutako says she will give her the snapshot under two conditions: one being that Tsutako can display it at the upcoming school festival, and two being that Yumi get Sachiko&#x27;s permission to do so as well. Yumi agrees to this, which sets in motion a series of events involving the entire Yamayuri Council. A few weeks after first meeting Sachiko, Yumi accepts Sachiko&#x27;s rosary and therefore agrees to become her &quot;petite sœur&quot;. This officially inducts Yumi into the Yamayuri Council where she assists them in school matters alongside Yoshino Shimazu and Shimako Tōdō—the &quot;petite sœurs&quot; of Rei Hasekura and Sei Satō, respectively. Through her activities in the Yamayuri Council, Yumi becomes closer to the other members and generally finds her experiences with the group to be enjoyable.

====Yamayuri Council====
Much of the story of &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; revolves around the , which acts as the student council. The Yamayuri Council meets in a building called the . It is located within the school and consists of two stories, including a meeting room on the second. The Yamayuri Council itself consists of three offices, named after roses: , , and . These are also referred to by their colors; the is &quot;Rosa foetida&quot;, the is &quot;Rosa gigantea&quot;, and the is &quot;Rosa chinensis&quot;.

Due to the high importance the three Rose families have in the development of the student activities within school, those who become &quot;petites sœurs&quot; of any of the mentioned families receive a functional &quot;inheritance&quot; through the &quot;grandes sœurs&quot; teachings, to adopt a position given certain circumstances. In this way, patrons are recognized through the generations of the members of the Rose families. Still, after graduating, the &quot;grandes sœurs&quot; of the Yamayuri Council may continue with a fair participation in the events concerning their families, as shown in the novels.

A , or , is one of three senior members of the Yamayuri Council. It is also possible to generally speak of all the members of the Yamayuri Council as roses. A Rose makes the critical decisions within this group since she controls the student council. Candidates for the position, which lasts through the school year, are chosen through an election. Any student can run to become a Rose, although the position is usually given to the &quot;en boutons&quot;, the Roses&#x27; &quot;petite sœurs&quot;.

The &quot;petite sœur&quot; of a &quot;Rosa&quot; is called an , otherwise known as a . &quot;En bouton&quot; is French for &quot;in bud&quot;—as used in the example &quot;Rosa Chinensis en bouton&quot;—and is unofficially considered part of the Yamayuri Council, as is the &quot;petite sœur&quot; of the &quot;en bouton&quot;, if she has one. The &quot;en boutons&quot; must be in a lower year than their &quot;Rosa&quot;, and generally, the &quot;en boutons&quot; execute the plans discussed by the Roses like assistants. Although the &quot;Rosa&quot; positions of the Yamayuri Council are traditionally passed to the &quot;en bouton&quot; on the graduation of the current holder, they are nonetheless elected offices that anyone may run for.

The &quot;petite sœur&quot; of the &quot;en bouton&quot; is called —as used in the example &quot;Rosa Chinensis en bouton petite sœur&quot;—and is otherwise known as the . She must be in a lower year than her &quot;en bouton&quot; and performs small duties, such as attending to the Roses&#x27; &quot;en boutons&quot;, cleaning the Rose Mansion, and making tea and snacks for the Yamayuri Council. This lasts a school year; the following year, when their &quot;en bouton&quot; is elected as &quot;Rosa&quot;, the &quot;petite sœurs&quot; automatically become &quot;en boutons&quot;.

==Production==
After writing her debut novel series for three years starting in March 1994, Oyuki Konno published a short story called &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; in the February 1997 issue of the &quot;shōjo&quot; magazine &quot;Cobalt&quot; with illustrations by Yuma Aoi. In 1993, Konno had previously won both Cobalt&#x27;s Novel Award and Readers&#x27; Award for &quot;Yume no Miya&quot;, and by February 1997, nine volumes had been released.

In the afterword of the first &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; light novel volume, Konno admitted that &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; was very different from her usual genre of story-telling in &quot;Yume no Miya&quot;, which she described as an &quot;imperial story&quot; set in a fictionalized classical Japan. For the basis of Lillian Girls&#x27; Academy, Konno drew from her own experiences attending an all-girl high school, and some of the scenery of Lillian was also taken from this, such as a ginkgo pathway which stretched out from the main gate. The laid-back atmosphere of the school was also incorporated into Lillian, although Konno&#x27;s school did not have a &quot;sœur&quot; system and it was not a Catholic school. Konno had been exposed to Christianity from a young age: she attended a completely Christian kindergarten which had a sanctuary and cloister in the middle of the school. Konno notes that she put her own questions about the Virgin Mary&#x27;s heart into the story via Yumi. Konno ultimately mixed together various sources and ended up with Lillian Girls&#x27; Academy.

==Media==
===Light novels===

After writing the &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; short story, Konno expanded it into a series of novels. The first volume was published on April 24, 1998, with illustrations by Reine Hibiki. In terms of the storyline, this first novel marks the beginning of the series; the original 1997 short story was reworked and republished in the ninth volume &quot;Cherry Blossom&quot; in 2001. Shueisha published 37 light novels in the series, ending with &quot;Farewell Bouquet&quot; on April 28, 2012. There were also two additional volumes published, the first containing an overview of the series and interviews, and the second featuring an illustration collection. Second editions were published starting in 2018 to commemorate its 20th anniversary. In February 2003, with 12 volumes released, Konno began to publish more short stories in &quot;Cobalt&quot;, with illustrations by Hibiki. Counting the 1997 debut, 27 short stories were published, which were included in later novels. The first five volumes of the light novel series were translated into German by Tokyopop.

Konno also wrote a spin-off series of light novels titled , also illustrated by Hibiki. These focus on Yumi&#x27;s younger brother Yūki and his schoolmates at Hanadera. Shueisha published 10 volumes between August 1, 2008 and November 30, 2013.

===Manga===

A manga adaptation, drawn by Satoru Nagasawa, was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s shōjo manga magazine &quot;Margaret&quot; between October 2003 and October 2005. Following this, the manga was transferred to Shueisha&#x27;s sister magazine &quot;The Margaret&quot; between May 2006 and December 2007. The manga was again serialized in &quot;The Margaret&quot; between May and August 2010. The individual chapters were collected and published in nine &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes released by Shueisha between February 2004 and October 2010. The first eight volumes were republished in five omnibus volumes in Japan between April and July 2010. The story in each volume follows the corresponding volume of the novels. The first eight volumes were translated into German by Tokyopop.

Six brief manga one-shots, illustrated by Reine Hibiki and based on some scenes from the novels, were published by Shueisha in &quot;Cobalt&quot; between February 2003 and December 2004. They are: , , , , , and . &quot;Before the Festival&quot; was later included in volume 18 of the novels, &quot;Premium Book&quot;, and the other five were later published in volume 26 of the novels, &quot;Illustration Collection&quot;.

==Reception==
It was reported in April 2010 that 5.4 million copies of the original light novels have been published. Reception to the &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; anime series has been generally positive, although Anime News Network (ANN) noted that the series leaves itself &quot;wide open to cynical sniggering.&quot; Carlos Ross from Them Anime regarded it as &quot;one of the most beautiful and graceful anime&quot; series, adding that the animation is sometimes of questionable quality but overall &quot;very appealing&quot;. Andrew Shelton from AMR found the series to be &quot;fairly unique&quot; compared to other shōjo works, explaining that although the story is &quot;a little basic&quot; and &quot;overly dramatic&quot;, what is most important is the &quot;response and actions of the character on who the story is focused.&quot; Stig Høgset, also from Them Anime, commented that the third season was criticized for being too short, but he personally did not feel &quot;like it was lacking something.&quot; Jason Thompson credits &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; with starting &quot;the modern yuri trend.&quot; Newer anime titles that &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; is compared to include &quot;Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Panic!&quot;, &quot;Best Student Council&quot;, and &quot;Aria&quot;. Carlos Ross, writing about the first novel in the series, felt the story was a &quot;classic rags-to-riches tale,&quot; but that it was &quot;also sweet, touching and witty when it needs to be.&quot; He criticized the lack of teachers and schoolwork in the series, which led to the plot being filled with extracurricular activities, which are common to high school series. He also criticized Yumi&#x27;s low self-esteem.

A characteristic element of the series is the extensive use of French titles, which Carlos Ross has criticized as &quot;distracting&quot;. Mania.com criticized the early anime episodes as being &quot;difficult&quot;, and saying that the first episode &quot;throws a lot of terms and names at you&quot;. On the other hand, Ross compared the &quot;atmosphere&quot; presented by the series&#x27; artwork with those from other anime titles of similar setting, including the bright and vivid &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;. Another reviewer from Them Anime also compared &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; with &quot;Oniisama e...&quot;, but noted that the former is much less dramatic. Marc Hairston commented on the unusual character designs compared to other series, and said they are &quot;ordinary students.&quot; ANN also noted the &quot;clear, expressive eyes and character designs that are gifted with an understated mobility,&quot; praising the casting choices, and noting that even &quot;peripheral&quot; characters are &quot;fully realized.&quot; Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime described the relationships between the characters as &quot;intensely platonic&quot; and &quot;pseudo-gay&quot; for the most part.

ANN noted that the second anime season tends to overdramatize, especially in the last three episodes. ANN also describes the second season as &quot;more embarrassing and shoujo-ai oriented&quot; than the first season, but that the solid characterization is still a strength of the series. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime appreciated the focus on characters other than Yumi and Sachiko for the second season, regarding Shimako&#x27;s loss of Sei and befriending Noriko as being &quot;one of the more moving&quot; arcs of &quot;Printemps&quot;. ANN regarded the OVA season as the best of the first three seasons, citing the improved production standards and the less melodramatic storylines. ANN notes that the fourth season is &quot;a return to dramatic form&quot; after the relaxation of the OVA series, but it is not as melodramatic as the second season, due to the increased maturity of the cast. Chris Beveridge, writing for Mania.com, found it odd that Yumi and Sachiko did not spend so much time together in the fourth season, and felt that the series needed an epilogue, but enjoyed seeing Yumi taking on some &quot;adult responsibilities.&quot;

Andrew Shelton has suggested that &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot;&#x27;s &quot;reduced capacity for epic drama&quot; is due to the lack of malicious characters; he considers the series &quot;pure shōjo&quot;, mostly due to its character-driven storyline. Japanese reviewers for their part regard the story as a revival of the Class S genre, and specifically a modern-day equivalent of Nobuko Yoshiya&#x27;s &quot;Hana Monogatari&quot;. Hairston notes that &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; emphasizes romance and emotion over sexuality, and it has a respectful treatment of its homoerotic themes. He describes the series as &quot;one of the most interesting and touching anime series of the last two years&quot;, adding that it is &quot;about self-discovery and self-acceptance.&quot;

A Pizza Hut tie-in campaign for the fourth anime series started on January 7, 2008. The Rose Mansion from the story was recreated in the &quot;Second Life&quot; virtual world and opened on February 8, 2008.

<text>Harold Craig Severance (July 1, 1879 – September 2, 1941) was an American architect who designed a number of well-known buildings in New York City, including the Coca-Cola Building, Nelson Tower and most prominently, 40 Wall Street.

==Biography==
He was born on July 1, 1879, to George Craig Severance and Emma Alida Gilbert. He married Faith Griswold Thompson.

In his early career, Severance worked for Carrere and Hastings and later, in partnership with William Van Alen. The partnership ended on unfriendly terms, and in the late 1920s, the two found themselves in competition to build the world&#x27;s tallest building, with Severance&#x27;s 40 Wall Street and Van Alen&#x27;s Chrysler Building. Although the Chrysler Building claimed victory with its spire at 1,046 feet, Severance protested that his building had the highest usable space. The issue became moot when the Empire State Building was completed less than a year later.

He died on September 2, 1941.

<text>Charlotte Rae Lubotsky (April 22, 1926 – August 5, 2018) was an American character actress and singer whose career spanned sixty-six years.

Rae was known for her portrayal of Edna Garrett in the sitcoms &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (in which she had the starring role from 1979 to 1986). She received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy in 1982. She also appeared in two &quot;Facts of Life&quot; television films: &quot;The Facts of Life Goes to Paris&quot; in 1982 and &quot;The Facts of Life Reunion&quot; in 2001. She voiced the character of &quot;Nanny&quot; in &quot;101 Dalmatians: The Series&quot; and Aunt Pristine Figg in &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;. She also appeared as Gammy Hart in &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;.

In 2015, she returned to film in the feature film &quot;Ricki and the Flash&quot;, with Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Rick Springfield. In November 2015, Rae released her autobiography, &quot;The Facts of My Life&quot;, which was co-written with her son, Larry Strauss.

==Early life==
Charlotte Rae Lubotsky was born on April 22, 1926, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her parents, Esther (&quot;née&quot; Ottenstein) and Meyer Lubotsky, were Russian Jewish immigrants. Mr. Lubotsky was a retail tire business owner. Rae&#x27;s mother, Esther Lubotsky, had been childhood friends with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. Rae was the second of three sisters, in between Beverly and Miriam (called &quot;Mimi&quot;). For the first ten years of her life, Rae&#x27;s family lived in an apartment built for them above her father&#x27;s Milwaukee tire store. In 1936, her parents purchased a home for the family in nearby Shorewood, Wisconsin. She graduated from Shorewood High School in 1944.

Rae attended Northwestern University, although she did not complete her studies. While there, she met friend Cloris Leachman. Many years later, Leachman succeeded Rae on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; for the show&#x27;s last two seasons. At Northwestern she met several then unknown stars and producers, including Agnes Nixon, Charlton Heston, Paul Lynde, Gerald Freedman, Claude Akins and songwriter Sheldon Harnick. In a 2016 interview with Milwaukee Talks, she said about her decision in appearing in only dramatic television: &quot;When I started out, I wanted to be a serious actor, I never thought I&#x27;d get into comedy.&quot; When a radio personality told her that her last name would not do, she dropped it, to her father&#x27;s chagrin.

==Career==

=== Acting ===
In 1954, Rae made her TV debut on episodes of &quot;Look Up and Live&quot; and &quot;The United States Steel Hour.&quot; This led to roles on other similar variety shows such as &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;NBC Television Opera Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;, and &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;.

Her first significant success was on the sitcom &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; (1961–1963), in which she played Sylvia Schnauzer, the wife of Officer Leo Schnauzer (played by Al Lewis). This was followed by roles in &quot;&#x27;Way Out&quot;; &quot;The Defenders&quot;; &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot;; &quot;The Love Boat&quot;; &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;; &quot;Barney Miller&quot;; &quot;Phyllis&quot;; &quot;227&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;; &quot;&quot;; &quot;All in the Family&quot;; and &quot;Good Times&quot;. She was nominated for an Emmy Award for her supporting role in the 1975 drama &quot;Queen of the Stardust Ballroom&quot;. In January 1975, Rae became a cast member on Norman Lear&#x27;s ABC television comedy &quot;Hot l Baltimore&quot;, wherein she played Mrs. Bellotti, whose dysfunctional adult son Moose, who was never actually seen, lived at the &quot;hot l&quot; (the &quot;E&quot; on the hotel&#x27;s neon sign was burnt out). Mrs. Bellotti, who was a bit odd herself, would visit Moose and then laugh about all the odd situations that Moose would get into with the others living at the hotel. Rae also appeared in an early season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as Molly, the Mail Lady.

Rae was a regular on &quot;The Rich Little Show&quot;, a variety show that ran for 11 episodes in 1976.

===&quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;===

In 1978, NBC was losing to both CBS and ABC in sitcom ratings, and Fred Silverman, future producer and former head of CBS, ABC, and NBC, insisted that Norman Lear produce &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;. Knowing that Rae was one of Lear&#x27;s favorite actresses (in addition to &quot;Hot l Baltimore&quot;, she also appeared in a 1974 episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot;) he hired her immediately for the role of housekeeper Edna Garrett, and she co-starred with Conrad Bain in all 24 episodes of the first season. In &quot;The Girls&#x27; School&quot; episode, Mrs. Garrett is asked to help out at Kimberly Drummond&#x27;s (actress Dana Plato) private school for girls called East Lake (later changed to Eastland). At the end of the episode, Mrs. Garrett decides to return to her housekeeping job at the Drummond residence.

===&quot;The Facts of Life&quot;===

In July 1979, Rae proposed the idea for a spinoff based on &quot;The Girls&#x27; School&quot; episode from &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;. NBC approved the show, to be called &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, which would portray a housekeeper turned housemother for boarding students in a prestigious private school. The program would deal with issues facing teenagers such as weight gain and dieting, depression, drugs, alcohol, and dating. Rae had a stipulation written into her contract that said she could return to &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; if the new spinoff was not successful.

After working as a character actress/comedienne in supporting roles or in guest shots on television series and specials, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; not only gave Rae her best-known role but also finally made her a television star.

&quot;The Facts of Life&quot; had marginal ratings at first, but after a major restructuring including some cast alterations, plus a time change for the second season, the show became a ratings winner between 1980 and 1986. Between the first and second seasons, Rae went on a very stringent diet and at the start of the second season had lost an enormous amount of weight. As a result, it was briefly mentioned in the second-season premiere two-part episode &quot;The New Girl&quot; and in the sixth installment &quot;Shoplifting&quot; that Rae&#x27;s character of Mrs. Garrett had also gone on a diet and lost weight. As the seasons passed, the show&#x27;s success and Rae&#x27;s popularity continued to grow. In 1982, Rae received an Emmy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Edna Garrett in &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. However, midway through both the 1984–85 and 1985–86 seasons, the series was undergoing a gradual transition. It was at this time that Rae&#x27;s appearances on the show were reduced at her request, and as a result, she was not seen in several episodes. The reason for this was that Rae felt that the girls&#x27; characters were maturing and not requiring as much of Mrs. Garrett&#x27;s rearing and advice.

Towards the end of the seventh season, Rae began to contemplate leaving the series. She wanted to spend more time doing theater as well as do some traveling. The producers of the show tried to persuade Rae to continue with &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; for at least another two years, but she felt her time on the program had run its course and decided to leave at the end of the 1985–86 season. Academy and Emmy Award-winning actress Cloris Leachman was signed as her replacement. In order to help with the transition, Rae agreed to make her last appearance on the show in the two-part eighth-season premiere &quot;Out of Peekskill&quot;. In that episode, Edna Garrett would marry, leave Peekskill with her new husband (played by Robert Mandan), and they both would move to Africa to work in the Peace Corps. In that same installment, Leachman would be introduced as Mrs. Garrett&#x27;s sister, Beverly Ann Stickle, who would attend the wedding, and then with Mrs. Garrett&#x27;s departure, she would then take over as a mother figure and friend for the girls. Rae and Leachman were very good friends having known each other since they were students at Northwestern University. Leachman inherited Rae&#x27;s top billing in the cast and her character remained for the show&#x27;s last two years. The part of Beverly Ann was quite similar to Leachman&#x27;s character of Phyllis Lindstrom on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;Phyllis&quot; from the 1970s. The cast change from Rae to Leachman did not seriously affect viewership. The series continued to garner healthy ratings until it ended in the spring of 1988. NBC wanted to renew the show for a tenth season, but cast members Nancy McKeon and Mindy Cohn wanted to move on to other things.

After her departure from &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, Rae still kept busy acting. In 1993, she voiced the villainess, Aunt Pristine Figg, in &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;. In 2000, she starred as Berthe in the Paper Mill Playhouse production of &quot;Pippin&quot;.

In 2001, Rae, Lisa Whelchel, Mindy Cohn, and Kim Fields were reunited in a TV movie, &quot;The Facts of Life Reunion&quot;. In 2007, the entire cast was invited to attend the TV Land Awards where several members of the cast, including Rae, sang the show&#x27;s theme song.

In 2007, she appeared in a cabaret show at the Plush Room in San Francisco for several performances. In the 2008 movie &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot;, Rae had a role as an older woman who has a fling with Adam Sandler&#x27;s character. On February 18, 2009, she appeared in a small role as Mrs. Ford in the &quot;Life&quot; episode &quot;I Heart Mom&quot;.

In a 2015 interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, Rae said that &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; series had an off-stage scale to weigh the girls, but that the pressure had the opposite effect producers were hoping for; &quot;The more they tried to pressure them and weigh them and threaten them, the more they would eat. It&#x27;s not the way you handle adolescence. You don&#x27;t do that.&quot;

On April 19, 2011, the entire cast was reunited again to attend the TV Land Awards, where the show was nominated and won the award for Pop Culture Icon. The same day, Nancy McKeon and Kim Fields (who played Jo and Tootie, respectively) gave a speech in honor of her 85th birthday. The cast did likewise on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, where at the end of the segment, reporter Cynthia McFadden wished Rae a happy birthday, and the cast sang the show&#x27;s theme song.

=== Singing ===
In 1955, she released her first (and only) solo album, &quot;Songs I Taught My Mother&quot;, which featured &quot;silly, sinful, and satirical&quot; songs by Sheldon Harnick, Vernon Duke, John La Touche, Cole Porter, Rodgers &amp; Hart and Marc Blitzstein, among others.

She appeared in Ben Bagley&#x27;s revue &quot;The Littlest Revue&quot; (and on its cast album) in 1956, appearing alongside Joel Grey and Tammy Grimes, among others, and singing songs by Sheldon Harnick (&quot;The Shape of Things&quot;), Vernon Duke (&quot;Summer is a-Comin&#x27; In&quot;), and Charles Strouse and Lee Adams (&quot;Spring Doth Let Her Colours Fly&quot;), a parody of opera singer Helen Traubel&#x27;s Las Vegas night club act, among others.

Rae later recorded &quot;Rodgers &amp; Hart Revisited&quot; with Dorothy Loudon, Cy Young, and Arthur Siegel, singing &quot;Everybody Loves You (When You Sleep)&quot; and in several other duets and ensembles for Bagley&#x27;s studio. Rae received two Tony Award nominations during her Broadway career. The first was in 1966 for Best Featured Actress in a Musical in &quot;Pickwick&quot;; the second came in 1969 for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;Morning, Noon and Night&quot;.

=== Theater ===
A stage actress since the 1950s, she appeared on Broadway in &quot;Three Wishes for Jamie&quot; (1952), &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (1954), &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1956) and &quot;Pickwick&quot; (1965), among others. In 1973, Rae played the role of Southern Comfort in Terrence McNally&#x27;s spoof &quot;Whiskey&quot; at Saint Clements&#x27; Theatre Off-Broadway. She appeared in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; Off-Broadway in 1999.

==Personal life==
Rae married composer John Strauss on November 4, 1951. In the mid-1970s, he came out as bisexual, and the couple divorced in 1976. Strauss died in 2011 at age 90 following a long battle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Rae had two sons with Strauss: Lawrence, a high school teacher, and his older brother Andrew (1955–1999). Andy was autistic and suffered from epilepsy.

Rae joined Alcoholics Anonymous in the early 1970s. The organization became an important part of her personal life.

==Health issues and death==
In 1982, Rae had a pacemaker implanted. With periodic alterations, the same pacemaker worked for over 30 years, but it stopped abruptly several years before her death. Her heart rate was around 35 beats per minute prior to entering emergency surgery to install a new pacemaker. The old pacemaker was left in place on the left side of her chest and the new, smaller pacemaker was placed on the right side. It functioned well until her death. In addition to pacemaker replacement, Rae had open-heart surgery to replace her mitral valve with a mechanical equivalent. Her left carotid artery was cleared of blockage as well.

In 2009, due to the frequency of pancreatic cancer in her own family, Rae was screened, diagnosed early, and became cancer-free after six months of chemotherapy. Her mother, an uncle, and her elder sister Beverly all reportedly died from pancreatic cancer. In 2017, aged 91, she was, however, diagnosed with bone cancer.

Rae died at her home in Los Angeles, California, on August 5, 2018. She was 92 years old.

<text>Substantive due process is a principle in United States constitutional law that allows courts to establish and protect substantive laws and certain fundamental rights from government interference, even if they are unenumerated elsewhere in the U.S. Constitution. Courts have asserted that such protections stem from the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibit the federal and state governments, respectively, from depriving any person of &quot;life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&quot; Substantive due process demarcates the line between acts that courts deem subject to government regulation or legislation and those they consider beyond the reach of governmental interference. Whether the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments were intended to serve that function continues to be a matter of scholarly as well as judicial discussion and dissent. In his concurrence in the 2022 landmark decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization, Justice Clarence Thomas called on the Supreme Court to reconsider all of its rulings that were based on substantive due process. 

Substantive due process is to be distinguished from procedural due process. The distinction arises from the words &quot;of law&quot; in the phrase &quot;due process of law&quot;. Procedural due process protects individuals from the coercive power of government by ensuring that adjudication processes, under valid laws, are fair and impartial. Such protections, for example, include sufficient and timely notice of why a party is required to appear before a court or other governmental body, the right to an impartial trier of fact and trier of law, and the right to give testimony and present relevant evidence at hearings. In contrast, substantive due process protects individuals against majoritarian policy enactments that exceed the limits of governmental authority: courts may find that a majority&#x27;s enactment is not law and cannot be enforced as such, even if the processes of enactment and enforcement were actually fair. 

The term was first used explicitly in 1930s legal casebooks as a categorical distinction of selected due process cases, and by 1952 Supreme Court opinions had mentioned it twice. The term &quot;substantive due process&quot; itself is commonly used in two ways: to identify a particular line of case law and to signify a particular political attitude toward judicial review under the two due process clauses.

Much substantive due process litigation involves legal challenges to the validity of unenumerated rights and seeks particular outcomes instead of merely contesting procedures and their effects. In successful cases, the Supreme Court recognizes a constitutionally based liberty and considers laws that seek to limit that liberty to be unenforceable or limited in scope. Critics of substantive due process decisions usually assert that such decisions should be left to the purview of more politically-accountable branches of government.

==Conceptual basics==
The courts have viewed the Due Process Clause and sometimes other clauses of the Constitution as embracing the fundamental rights that are &quot;implicit in the concept of ordered liberty&quot;. The rights have not been clearly identified and the Supreme Court&#x27;s authority to enforce the unenumerated rights is unclear. Some of the rights have been said to be &quot;deeply rooted&quot; in American history and tradition; that phrase was used for rights related to the institution of the family.

The courts have largely abandoned the Lochner era approach (c. 1897–1937), when substantive due process was used to strike down minimum wage and labor laws to protect freedom of contract. Since then, the Supreme Court has decided that the Constitution protects numerous other freedoms, even if they are not in the text. If the federal courts&#x27; doctrine of substantive due process did not protect them, they could nevertheless be protected in other ways; for example, other provisions of the state or federal constitutions or legislatures protect some rights.

Today, the Supreme Court provides special protection for three types of rights under substantive due process in the Fourteenth Amendment – an approach which originated in &quot;United States v. Carolene Products Co.&quot;, , footnote 4:
* Rights enumerated in and derived from the first eight amendments to the Constitution
* The right to participate in the political process, such as the rights of voting, association, and free speech
* The rights of &quot;discrete and insular minorities&quot;

The Supreme Court usually looks first to see whether the right is a fundamental right by examining whether it is deeply rooted in American history and traditions. If the right is not a fundamental right, the court applies a rational basis test: if the violation of the right can be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, the law is then held valid. If the court establishes that the right being violated is a fundamental right, it applies strict scrutiny and asks whether the law is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and whether the law is narrowly tailored to address that interest.

==History of jurisprudence==
Early in American judicial history, various jurists attempted to form theories of natural rights and natural justice to limit the power of government, especially on property and the rights of persons. Opposing &quot;vested rights&quot; were other jurists, who argued that the written constitution was the supreme law of the State and that judicial review could look only to that document, not to the &quot;unwritten law&quot; of &quot;natural rights&quot;. Opponents also argued that the &quot;police power&quot; of government allowed legislatures to regulate the holding of property in the public interest, subject only to specific prohibitions of the written constitution.

===Early origins===
The phrase &quot;substantive due process&quot; was not used until the 20th century, but the concept arguably existed in the 19th century. The idea was a way to import natural law norms into the Constitution; prior to the American Civil War, the state courts were the site of the struggle. Critics of substantive due process claim that the doctrine began, at the federal level, with the infamous 1857 slavery case of &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. Advocates of substantive due process acknowledge that the doctrine was employed in &quot;Dred Scott&quot; but claim that it was employed incorrectly. Indeed, abolitionists and others argued that both before and after &quot;Dred Scott&quot;, the Due Process Clause actually prohibited the federal government from recognizing slavery. Also, the first appearance of substantive due process, as a concept, had appeared in &quot;Bloomer v. McQuewan&quot;, .

The &quot;vested rights&quot; jurists saw the &quot;law of the land&quot; and &quot;due process&quot; clauses of state constitutions as restrictions on the substantive content of legislation. They were sometimes successful in arguing that certain government infringements were prohibited, regardless of procedure. For example, in 1856, the New York Court of Appeals held in &quot;Wynehamer v. New York&quot; that &quot;without &#x27;due process of law&#x27;, no act of legislation can deprive a man of his property, and that in civil cases an act of the legislature alone is wholly inoperative to take from a man his property&quot;. However, in 1887 the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently rejected the rationale of &quot;Wynehamer&quot;. Other antebellum cases on due process include &quot;Murray&#x27;s Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.&quot;, which dealt with procedural due process, but the Supreme Court subsequently characterized the rationale of &quot;Murray&quot;, in the case of &quot;Hurtado v. California&quot;, as not providing &quot;an indispensable test&quot; of due process.

Another important pre-Civil War milestone in the history of due process was Daniel Webster&#x27;s argument to the Supreme Court as counsel in &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot; that the Due Process Clause forbids bills of attainder and various other types of depriving legislation. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court declined in the case to address that aspect of Webster&#x27;s argument, the New Hampshire Supreme Court having already rejected it.

Roger Taney, in his &quot;Dred Scott&quot; opinion, pronounced without elaboration that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional because an &quot;act of Congress that deprived a citizen of his liberty or property merely because he came himself or brought his property into a particular territory of the United States, and who had committed no offence against the laws, could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law&quot;. In the case, neither Taney nor the dissenting Benjamin Robbins Curtis mentioned or relied upon the Court&#x27;s previous discussion of due process in &quot;Murray&quot;, and Curtis disagreed with Taney about what &quot;due process&quot; meant.

===&quot;Lochner&quot; era===

Following the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s due process clause prompted substantive due process interpretations to be urged on the Supreme Court as a limitation on state legislation. Initially, however, the Supreme Court rejected substantive due process as it came to be understood, including in the seminal &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot;. Beginning in the 1870s through the late 1880s, the Supreme Court hinted in dicta that various state statutes challenged under a different constitutional provision may have been invalidated under the due process clause. The first case to invalidate a state government economic regulation under this theory was &quot;Allgeyer v. Louisiana&quot; in 1897 which interpreted the word &quot;liberty&quot; in the due process clause to mean economic liberty. The Supreme Court would go on to impose on both federal and state legislation a firm judicial hand on property and economics right until the Great Depression in the 1930s.

The Court typically invalidated statutes during the &quot;Lochner&quot; era (named after Lochner v. New York) by declaring the statutes in violation of the right to contract. The Court invalidated state laws prohibiting employers from insisting, as a condition of employment, that their employees agree not to join a union. The Court also declared a state minimum wage law for women unconstitutional. Because many of the first applications protected the rights of corporations and employers to be free of governmental regulation, some scholars believe that substantive due process developed as a consequence of the Court&#x27;s desire to accommodate 19th-century railroads and trusts.

===Later development===
The end of the &quot;Lochner&quot; era came in 1937 with the Supreme Court&#x27;s holding in &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish.&quot; In that case, the Court upheld the state of Washington&#x27;s &quot;Minimum Wages for Women&quot; act, reasoning that the Constitution permitted the restriction of liberty of contract by state law where such restriction protected the community, health and safety, or vulnerable groups.

Although economic due process restrictions on legislation were largely abandoned by the courts, substantive due process rights continue to be successfully asserted today in non-economic legislation that affects intimate issues like bodily integrity, marriage, religion, childbirth, child-rearing, and sexuality.

Privacy, which is not mentioned in the Constitution, was at issue in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, when the Court held, in 1965, that criminal prohibition of contraceptive devices for married couples violated federal, judicially enforceable privacy rights. The right to contraceptives was found in what the Court called the &quot;penumbras&quot;, or shadow edges, of certain amendments that arguably refer to certain privacy rights, such as the First Amendment, which protects freedom of expression; the Third Amendment, which protects homes from being taken for use by soldiers; and the Fourth Amendment, which provides security against unreasonable searches. The penumbra-based rationale of &quot;Griswold&quot; has since been discarded; the Supreme Court now uses the Due Process Clause as a basis for various unenumerated privacy rights, as John Marshall Harlan II had argued in his concurring &quot;Griswold&quot; opinion, instead of relying on the &quot;penumbras&quot; and &quot;emanations&quot; of the Bill of Rights, as the majority opinion did in &quot;Griswold&quot;.

Although it has never been the majority view, some have argued that the Ninth Amendment, on unenumerated rights, could be used as a source of fundamental judicially enforceable rights, including a general right to privacy, as discussed by Arthur Goldberg in concurring in &quot;Griswold&quot;.

The Supreme Court also recognized a substantive due process right &quot;to control the education of one&#x27;s children&quot;, thus voiding state laws mandating for all students to attend public school. In &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot;, the Supreme Court said in 1925:

Some justices have argued, however, that a substantive due process claim may not be necessary in cases of this type, as it is possible for those laws to be deemed to violate &quot;First Amendment principles&quot; as well. Justice Anthony Kennedy speculated in the 2000 case of &quot;Troxel v. Granville&quot; that current Supreme Court doctrine prohibits the judiciary from using the Due Process Clause instead of an applicable specific constitutional provision if one is available.

The right to marry a person of a different race was addressed in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;, in which the Court said, in 1967, that its decision striking down anti-miscegenation laws could be justified either by substantive due process, or by the Equal Protection Clause. The unconstitutionality of bans on and refusals to recognize same-sex marriage was decided partly on substantive due process grounds by &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; in 2015. A right to have children was addressed in &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot;, but the Court in &quot;Skinner&quot;, in 1942, explicitly declined to base its decision on due process but instead cited the Equal Protection Clause since the Oklahoma law required sterilization of some three-time felons but not others. A substantive due process right of a parent to educate a young child (before ninth grade) in a foreign language was recognized in &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot;, in 1923, with two justices dissenting, and Justice Kennedy has mentioned that &quot;Meyer&quot; might be decided on different grounds in modern times. Laws that &quot;shock the conscience&quot; of the Court were generally deemed unconstitutional, in 1952, in &quot;Rochin v. California&quot;, but in concurring, Justices Black and Douglas argued that pumping a defendant&#x27;s stomach for evidence should have been deemed unconstitutional on the narrower ground that it violates the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s right against self-incrimination. The Court, in &quot;O&#x27;Connor v. Donaldson&quot;, in 1975, said that due process is violated by confining a nondangerous mentally ill person who is capable of surviving safely in freedom. Chief Justice Burger&#x27;s concurring opinion was that such confinement may also amount to &quot;punishment&quot; for being mentally ill, violating the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Eighth Amendment in &quot;Robinson v. California&quot;. Freedom from excessive punitive damages was deemed to be a due process right in &quot;BMW v. Gore&quot;, in 1996, but four justices disagreed. The Court, in &quot;Cruzan v. Missouri&quot;, decided, in 1990, that due process is not violated if a state applies &quot;a clear and convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state&quot;.

In 2022, the Court declared that the right to an abortion is not deeply rooted in the nation’s history, and therefore is not among unenumerated rights in the constitution by virtue of the Due Process clause.

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that judges are making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators (&quot;legislating from the bench&quot;), that they are reading doctrines and principles into the Constitution that are not expressed in or implied by the document, or that they are claiming power to expand the liberty of some people at the expense of other people&#x27;s liberty (such as in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;).

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., a proponent of legal realism, worried that the Court was overstepping its boundaries and wrote, in 1930, in one of his last dissents:

Originalists, such as Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas, who rejects the substantive due process doctrine, and Antonin Scalia, who also questioned the legitimacy of the doctrine, have called substantive due process a &quot;judicial usurpation&quot; or an &quot;oxymoron&quot;. Both Scalia and Thomas occasionally joined Court opinions that mention the doctrine and, in their dissents, often argued over how substantive due process should be employed based on Court precedent.

Many non-originalists, like Justice Byron White, have also been critical of substantive due process. As propounded in his dissents in &quot;Moore v. East Cleveland&quot; and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, as well as his majority opinion in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, White argued that the doctrine of substantive due process gives the judiciary too much power over the governance of the nation and takes away such power from the elected branches of government. He argued that the fact that the Court has created new substantive rights in the past should not lead it to &quot;repeat the process at will&quot;. In his book &quot;Democracy and Distrust&quot;, non-originalist John Hart Ely criticized &quot;substantive due process&quot; as a glaring &quot;non sequitur&quot;. Ely argued the phrase was both a contradiction in terms, like the phrase &quot;green pastel redness&quot;, and radically undemocratic by allowing judges to impose substantive values on the political process. Ely argued that the courts should serve to reinforce the democratic process, not to displace the substantive value choices of the people&#x27;s elected representatives.

An alternative to strict originalist theory is advocated by former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the Court&#x27;s supporters of substantive due process rights. Breyer believes the justices need to look at cases in light of how their decisions will promote what he calls &quot;active liberty&quot;, the Constitution&#x27;s aim of promoting participation by citizens in the processes of government. That is an approach that ostensibly emphasizes &quot;the document&#x27;s underlying values&quot; and a broad look at a law&#x27;s purpose and consequences. Critics charge that such an approach would also give judges the ability to look very broadly at the consequences and unwritten purpose of constitutional provisions, such as the Due Process Clause, thus removing issues from the democratic process.

Originalism is usually linked to opposition against substantive due process rights, and the reasons can be found in the following explanation that was endorsed unanimously by the Supreme Court in the 1985 case &quot;University of Michigan v. Ewing&quot;: &quot;we must always bear in mind that the substantive content of the [Due Process] Clause is suggested neither by its language nor by preconstitutional history; that content is nothing more than the accumulated product of judicial interpretation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.&quot;

Originalists do not necessarily oppose protection of rights protected by substantive due process. Most originalists believe that such rights should be identified and protected legislatively or by further constitutional amendments or other existing provisions of the Constitution. For example, some substantive due process liberties may be protectable according to the original meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Most originalists believe that rights should be identified and protected by the majority legislatively or, if legislatures lack the power, by constitutional amendments.

The original perceived scope of the Due Process Clause was different from the one in use today. For instance, even though many of the Framers of the Bill of Rights believed that slavery violated the fundamental natural rights of African Americans, legal scholar Robert Cover argued in 1975 that a &quot;theory that declared slavery to be a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment ... requires nothing more than a suspension of reason concerning the origin, intent, and past interpretation of the clause&quot;. The Thirteenth Amendment ultimately abolished slavery and removed the federal judiciary from the business of returning fugitive slaves. Until then, it was &quot;scarcely questioned&quot; (as Abraham Lincoln put it) that the Constitution &quot;was intended by those who made it, for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the law-giver is the law&quot;.

==Judicial review==
When a law or other act of government is challenged as a violation of individual liberty under the Due Process Clause, courts now use two forms of scrutiny or judicial review. The inquiry balances the importance of the governmental interest being served and the appropriateness of the method of implementation against the resulting infringement of individual rights. If the governmental action infringes upon a fundamental right, the highest level of review, strict scrutiny, is used. To pass strict scrutiny, the law or the act must be both narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.

If the governmental restriction restricts liberty in a manner that does not implicate a fundamental right, rational basis review is used, which determines whether a law or act is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The government&#x27;s goal must be something that it is acceptable for the government to pursue. The legislation must use reasonable means to the government&#x27;s goals but not necessarily the best. Under a rational basis test, the burden of proof is on the challenger so laws are rarely overturned by a rational basis test.

There is also a middle level of scrutiny, called intermediate scrutiny, but it is used primarily in Equal Protection cases, rather than in Due Process cases: &quot;The standards of intermediate scrutiny have yet to make an appearance in a due process case.&quot; To pass intermediate scrutiny, the challenged law must further an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest.

<doc id="585094" wikidata="Q2935217" url="?curid=585094" title="Camp Hale">
<text>Camp Hale was a U.S. Army training facility in the western United States, constructed in 1942 for what became the 10th Mountain Division. Located in central Colorado between Red Cliff and Leadville in the Eagle River Valley at an elevation of , it was named for General Irving Hale. Onslow S. Rolfe, who had developed mountain warfare techniques as commander of the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, was selected to command Camp Hale.

Soldiers were trained in mountain climbing, Alpine and Nordic skiing, cold-weather survival, and various weapons and ordnance. When it was in full operation, approximately 15,000 soldiers were housed there.

The creation of an elite ski corps was a national effort, with assistance from the National Association of Ski Patrol, local ski clubs, and Hollywood. Enough men were recruited to create three army regiments, which were deployed after training. Camp Hale was decommissioned in November 1945.

On October 12, 2022, President Joe Biden designated Camp Hale and a noncontiguous nearby part of the Tenmile Range as Camp Hale—Continental Divide National Monument. It comprises , which will be managed by the White River National Forest unit of the U.S. Forest Service. Conversion of the site to a monument will not affect any permits held by the neighboring ski resorts and the monument will continue to support a wide range of motorized and non-motorized recreation opportunities.

== World War II ==
=== Construction ===
The armed ski corps in the U.S. was based on the ski warfare tactics of the Finnish Army during the Winter War (1939–1940). Early in the effort, 8,000 skiers and outdoorsmen were recruited. The camp was built to accommodate the effort at a cost of $30 million.

The War Department chose the location at because the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad stopped at Pando rail station and historically the snowfall in the Tennessee Pass area was plentiful. Construction of the camp began in the spring of 1942 and finished seven months later; during that period Highway 24 was moved, a sewage system installed to prevent pollution in the nearby town of Red Cliff, and the meadow drained. Additionally, the nearby town of Leadville to the south, the only source of recreation for the trainees, was persuaded to change its moral character, perceived &quot;to be on a rather low plane.&quot;

The camp included mess halls, infirmaries, a ski shop, administrative offices, a movie theater, and stables for livestock. White painted barracks for 15,000 soldiers were built straight lines on the mountain meadow, but when the first trainees of the 87th Regiment of the 10th Light Division, quickly renamed the 10th Mountain Division, arrived in the winter of 1942 only a small portion of barracks were filled. The War Department needed to train more skiers in the elite fighting ski corps and asked the American Ski Patrol Association to contact ski racing clubs, ski schools, and local patrol units, nationwide—each applicant had to supply three letters of recommendation.

=== Recruitment ===
After 1942 problems in communication caused by the war slowed the recruitment effort. However, that year, Darryl Zanuck released &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot;, starring Sonja Henie and featuring the Glenn Miller Orchestra, and filmed on location in Sun Valley. The movie was a hit and the Hollywood effort helped to interest trainees in the ski corps. Two more wartime movies were made, each filmed at Camp Hale, featuring the white-clad elite troops—&quot;Mountain Fighters&quot; in 1943 and &quot;I Love a Soldier&quot; in 1944. The ski corps was featured on national magazine covers and popular radio shows. Although the effort brought in recruits to add the 86th and 85th Regiments for a full division, recruiters realized not enough skiers existed to fill the new regiments; thereafter, efforts were made to bring in rugged outdoorsmen of all types with the slogan that the 10th Mountain Division was made up of &quot;college boys to cowboys&quot;. In addition, 200 women from the Women&#x27;s Army Corps were brought in for administrative support.

=== Training ===

By 1943, Camp Hale had as many as 14,000 men in training. Conditions in the camp were harsh: the altitude required acclimation and the shallow valley created polluted inversion layers, as the primary energy source was coal. Recreation (outside of skiing) was non-existent because of the camp&#x27;s high mountain isolation, which prevented even the USO from visiting, and many of the non-skiing trainees hated skiing. Trainees were taught to ski at Cooper Hill by ski instructors, brought from the ski-areas such as Sun Valley and Waterville Valley. Located three miles (5 km) south of the camp, Cooper Hill had on-site barracks for the instructors and a newly built T-bar lift for the trainees.

Military use of Camp Hale included the 10th Mountain Division, commanded by Lloyd E. Jones, the 38th Regimental Combat Team, the Norwegian-American 99th Infantry Battalion (Separate), and soldiers from Fort Carson conducting mountain and winter warfare training exercises. Trainees were taught skiing, mountain climbing, snow survival skills (such as building snow caves), and winter combat. Also present at Camp Hale was the 620th Engineer General Service Company, a unit composed of suspected unreliable German-Americans or soldiers with suspected pro-National Socialist beliefs.

Camp Hale was active for just three years; it was deactivated in November 1945 and the 10th Mountain Division moved to Texas.

=== Prisoner of war camp ===
Camp Hale held &quot;about 400 of the most incorrigible members of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Corps&quot;. On 15 February 1944, guard Private Dale Maple of the 620th Engineer General Service Unit drove away with German Sergeants Heinrich Kikillus and Erhard Schwichtenberg. They made it to Mexico before being arrested and turned over to U.S. authorities. In an unrelated scandal, in March 1944, five WACs were charged with exchanging notes with the prisoners. Three received sentences of four to six months of confinement. The army used POWs to dismantle most of the structures in 1945.

== Late 20th century ==

Many Tibetan resistance fighters were secretly trained at Camp Hale by the CIA. &quot;By February 1963, four groups totaling 135 Tibetans (ten more than originally planned) had arrived at Hale.&quot; This was &quot;... the first wave of Tibetans.&quot; The site was chosen because of the similarities of the terrain and elevation with the Himalayan Plateau, being heavily mountainous and over 10,000 feet above sea level. The fighters were trained in the use of mortars, explosive, and rifles and instructed in the art of guerilla warfare and subterfuge. The Tibetans nicknamed the camp &quot;Dhumra&quot;, meaning &quot;The Garden&quot;, due to their enriched hatred of the Chinese occupation of their country. To cover up their newly heightened activity within the camp, the CIA circulated a story in the local press that Camp Hale was to be the site of atomic tests and would be a high security zone going forward. Until the camp was closed in 1964, the entire area was cordoned off and its perimeter patrolled by military police to keep any unwanted eyes away. In all, around 259 Tibetans were trained at Camp Hale, and after it was dismantled, no Tibetans remained in Colorado having all be redeployed into their homeland to fight against the Chinese. From 1958 to 1960, Anthony Poshepny trained various special missions teams, including Tibetan Khambas and Hui Muslims, for operations in China against the communist government.

In 1965, Camp Hale was dismantled and the land was deeded to the U.S. Forest Service. Since 1974, the area has become a youth development training center. An Eagle County non-profit organization, SOS Outreach, has used the site to expose disadvantaged youth to many of the same outdoor challenges experienced by the 10th Mountain Division.

In 1962, Pete Seibert, who was among the soldiers who trained at Camp Hale and then returned to the area after the war, founded the Vail Ski Resort nearby.

In July and August 1985 the valley was the site of the North American Pathfinder camporee with 16,129 attending.
== Current status ==
In 2003, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began a cleanup effort to remove some of the unexploded ordnance at the site in conjunction with several other government agencies. This effort is still ongoing.

Most of the remnants of Camp Hale are located in the White River National Forest. There are camping grounds where overnight camping is permitted on this former army base. Several informational plaques are located throughout the area. These plaques contain historical information about camp construction, the 99th Infantry Battalion, ski training, rock climbing/alpine training, the motor pool area, CIA training, and camp entertainment.

== National Monument ==
In 2019, the Camp Hale site was proposed to be the first National Historic Landscape, under the Colorado Outdoor Recreation &amp; Economy (CORE) Act, which would designate 28,728 acres for preservation. Congressman Joe Neguse hosted Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, and U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper at Camp Hale on August 22, 2022, in support of the bill. With the bill stalled in Congress, on October 12, 2022, President Biden visited the site with the same five leaders and used the Antiquities Act to declare the site a national monument, the 53,804-acre Camp Hale – Continental Divide National Monument. While the designation had support of area mayors and county commissioners and &quot;drew a flurry of praise from political, social and conservation groups&quot;, various conservative politicians spoke out in opposition to the new national monument. A survey had found 86% of Coloradans supported national monument protections for Colorado recreation and conservation areas.

The monument includes approximately 28,684 acres in the Camp Hale area and 25,210 acres in the Tenmile area. The Tenmile area was originally proposed in the CORE Act to be recreation management area and wilderness area. The Continental Divide Trail passes through both sections for approximately 20 miles.

<doc id="585095" wikidata="Q1130969" url="?curid=585095" title="Fandango">
<text>Fandango is a lively partner dance originating in Portugal and Spain, usually in triple meter, traditionally accompanied by guitars, castanets, tambourine or hand-clapping. Fandango can both be sung and danced. Sung fandango is usually bipartite: it has an instrumental introduction followed by &quot;variaciones&quot;. Sung fandango usually follows the structure of &quot;cante&quot; that consist of four or five octosyllabic verses (coplas) or musical phrases (tercios). Occasionally, the first copla is repeated.

The meter of fandango is similar to that of the bolero and seguidilla. It was originally notated in time, of slow tempo, mostly in the minor, with a trio in the major; sometimes, however, the whole was in a major key. Later it took the 3-4 tempo, and the characteristic Spanish rhythm.

==Origins==
The earliest fandango melody is found in the anonymous &quot;Libro de diferentes cifras de guitarra&quot; from 1705, and the earliest description of the dance itself is found in a 1712 letter by Martín Martí, a Spanish priest. The fandango&#x27;s first sighting in a theatrical work was in Francisco de Leefadeal&#x27;s &quot;entremés&quot; &quot;El novio de la aldeana&quot; staged in Seville, ca. 1720. By the late 18th century it had become fashionable among the aristocracy and was often included in tonadillas, zarzuelas, ballets and operas, not only in Spain, but also elsewhere in Europe.

Widely varying claims have been made about the origin of fandango: its relation to the jabera, the soleá, and the petenera; to the Andalusian malagueña, granadina, murciana and rondeña; to the canario and gitano; to the jota aragonesa.

=== Condemnation and liberation by Spanish Church ===
There is a curious piece of history said to be connected with this dance. Soon after its first introduction, in the 17th century, it was condemned by the ecclesiastical authorities in Spain as a &quot;godless dance&quot;. Just as the Consistory were about to prohibit it, one of the judges remarked that it was not fair to condemn anyone unheard. Two celebrated dancers were accordingly introduced to perform the fandango before the Consistory. This they did with such effect, that, according to the old chronicler, &quot;every one joined in, and the hall of the consistorium was turned into a dancing saloon&quot;. No more was heard of the condemnation of the fandango.

==Classical music==
The form of fandango has been used by many European composers, and often included in stage and instrumental works. Notable examples include J. P. Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Les trois mains&quot; (in &quot;Nouvelles suites de pièces de clavecin&quot;, ca. 1729–30); Fandango forms #19 in the part 2 of Gluck&#x27;s ballet &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1761); in the third-act finale of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1786); in the finale of Luigi Boccherini&#x27;s String Quartet Op. 40 No. 2 (1798) and Guitar Quintet G.448; Antonio Soler&#x27;s Fandango for harpsichord; and the finale of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot;. Luis de Freitas Branco&#x27;s third movement of his &quot;Suite Alentejana No. 1&quot; is inspired on the fandango of the regions of Alentejo and Ribatejo of Portugal. Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; also follows the rhythm of the fandango. In the 21st century, Italian composer Carlotta Ferrari has written several Fandangos; particularly, her 2020 &quot;Fandango RPS&quot; uses the Restarting Pitch Space harmony system.

Italian composer Domenico Scarlatti, who was influenced by Iberian folk music, had several passages reminiscent of fandango, such as in his keyboard sonata K. 492 (1756) which has been called &quot;Fandango portugués&quot;. The piece &quot;Fandango del Sigr. Escarlate&quot; has been attributed to him, but some scholars dispute this claim and its similarity to fandangos.

The Spanish form of fandango is given by Dohrn in the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik.&quot;

==Spanish dance==
The current pattern of the fandango, its distinctive progression (i–iv–V) lyrics with octosyllabic verses and the use of castanets and guitars are well-documented from the 18th century. The &quot;fandangos grandes&quot; (big fandangos) are normally danced by couples, which start out slowly with gradually increasing tempo. Many varieties are derived from this one. The &quot;fandanguillos&quot; (little fandangos) are livelier, more festive derivations of fandangos. Some regions of Spain have developed their own style of fandangos, such as Huelva &quot;(fandangos de Huelva)&quot; and Málaga &quot;(fandangos de Málaga&quot;, or &quot;Verdiales)&quot;. Northern areas such as the Principality of Asturias, the Basque Country and Castile and León have preserved a more relaxed performance.

==Portuguese dance==
Fandango is one of the main folk dances in Portugal. The choreography is quite simple: on its more frequent setting two male dancers face each other, dancing and tap-dancing one at a time, showing which has the most lightness and repertoire of feet changes in the tap-dancing. The dancers can be boy and girl, boy and boy (most frequent) or, rarely, two girls. While one of the dancers dances, the other just &quot;goes along&quot;. Afterwards, they &quot;both drag their feet for a while&quot; until the other one takes his turn. They stay there, disputing, seeing which one of them makes the feet transitions more eye-catching.

The &quot;fandango do Ribatejo&quot; refers specifically to the form of fandango practiced in Ribatejo, Portugal. The dance is usually performed by two Campinos.

==Figurative meaning==

As a result of the extravagant features of the dance, the word &quot;fandango&quot; is used as a synonym for &quot;a quarrel&quot;, &quot;a big fuss&quot;, or &quot;a brilliant exploit&quot;.

== Fandango in Veracruz ==
In Veracruz, Mexico, a fandango is a party where people get together to dance, to play and to sing in a community setting. As local musicians perform the Son Jarocho music, people dance &quot;zapateado&quot; atop a large wooden platform known as a Tarima.

<doc id="585098" wikidata="Q7427495" url="?curid=585098" title="Kalashnikov Concern">
<text>JSC Kalashnikov Concern (; ), known until 2013 as the Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant (; ), is a Russian defense manufacturing concern and joint-stock company headquartered in the city of Izhevsk in the Republic of Udmurtia as well as the capital city of Moscow. The concern designs and produces a wide range of civilian and military weapons including assault rifles, sniper rifles, designated marksman rifles, machine guns, squad automatic weapons, hunting rifles, shotguns, guided artillery projectiles, and a wide range of other precision weapons including remote controlled weapon stations, unmanned vehicles, and military robots.

The Kalashnikov Concern produces about 95% of all small arms in Russia and supplies to more than 27 countries around the world, making it the largest firearm manufacturer in Russia. Notable products include the Kalashnikov (AK) assault rifle series, the RPK light machine gun series, the Dragunov SVD semi-automatic sniper rifle, the SKS semi-automatic carbine, the Makarov PM pistol, the Saiga-12 shotgun, and the submachine guns Vityaz-SN and PP-19 Bizon. These firearms, except for the SVD, SKS and the PM, were based on the famous AK series, due to its reliability to endure harsh conditions, low production costs, availability in nearly every geographical region, and ease of use.

As of 2018, 26% of the Concern&#x27;s shares belong to Rostec, while 74% of the company belongs to private investors (Alexey Krivoruchko and Andrei Bokarev).

The Concern contains three firearm brands: &quot;Kalashnikov&quot; (combat and civilian weapons), &quot;Baikal&quot; (hunting and civilian guns), and &quot;Izhmash&quot; (sporting rifles). The concern is developing new business lines that include remote weapon stations, unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, and multi-functional special-purpose boats.

== History ==
=== First years ===
On 10 June 1807 by the decree of the Emperor of All Russias Alexander I a firearms factory was established in the city of Izhevsk, the construction and operation of which was headed by the chief mining engineer of the city ironworks Andrey Deryabin. Architects, Semyon Yemelyanovich Dudin and Andrey Deryabin developed a long-term master plan for further comprehensive development of the arsenal. Due to the proximity of the ironworks, the armory was supposed to be built on the bank of the Izh River, which immediately solved the problem of raw material supply.

Deryabin employed Russian and Udmurtian agricultural workers living in the city. At that time, agricultural workers had to settle in the arsenal and work there. Neighboring settlements were exempt from this rule, but they had to provide the arsenal with carts, horses and harnesses. Deryabin also hired foreign arsenal experts to train Russian craftsmen; in 1807 the arsenal produced seven long guns, five pistols and six backswords.

The first weapons developed by the armory were the No. 15 17.7mm muskets, produced in the autumn of 1807. In 1808, the musket was later mass-produced for infantry equipping. The plant supplied the Imperial Russian Army with over 6,000 of the No. 15 17.7mm muskets. In 1809, the arsenal produced rifles, muskets, carbines, and flint explosives for cavalry units. It also produced pistols and gun parts and remelted trophy weapons. During the Napoleonic Wars, especially during the French invasion of Russia, firearms were quickly produced for the Russian army, even though the arsenal had not been finished yet. In the first four years, the factory produced 2,000 long-barreled guns; in 1814, production increased to 10,000 guns and 2,500 swords; by 1830, desired annual output was 25,000 long-barreled guns and 5,000 backswords.

Between 1811 and 1816, ten stone factory buildings, several wooden buildings and the main tower-like building of the arsenal were constructed. In 1817, the construction of the main arsenal building was completed. This four-story building was one of the first multi-storey industrial buildings in Russia. The production process was multi-layered, starting with rough preparatory work (on the lower floors) and ending with the assembly of weapons (on the upper floors).

=== Mid to Late 1800s ===
Starting in the 1830s, the armory started manufacturing &quot;Gartung&quot; short rifles, &quot;Phalis&quot; breech-loading rifles, and boarding guns for the Baltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy. In 1835, the armory transferred cold steel production of swords and lances to Zlatoust, focusing mainly on firearm production. In 1844, the armory started upgrading current guns into more rapid firing percussion muskets. The armory also started using the caplock mechanism for its products in 1845. During the Crimean War, Izhevsk supplied the Russian Imperial Army with 130,000 rifles, with a third of them grooved. By 1857, 50 years after the creation of the armory, over 670,000 flintlock firearms, over 220,000 percussion firearms, over 58 thousand rifles, as well as a plentiful number of swords and lances were produced.

In 1867, the armory was reorganized into a lease and a private commercial enterprise. At this time, the armory was retrofitted and equipped with steam-engines, new machines, and an open-hearth furnace. This allowed the armory to produce more breech-loading weapons for the Russian Imperial Army, notably the &quot;Krnk&quot; and &quot;Berdan&quot; type rifles. The Berdan rifle was the most widely produced firearm at the plant during the time as well, indirectly allowing Russia to approach the European industrial empires&#x27; level of armaments.

By 1870, production rate at the armory exceeded both the armories of Tula and Sestroretsk. Later, when the methods of high-quality steel production were well mastered, Izhevsk became the source of gun barrels and barrel receivers for Russian plants. For example, armory enterprises in Tula used annually up to 360,000 barrels from the armory at Izhevsk. In 1884, the plant was later returned to the state and became Izhevsk Gun and Steel Factories (IGSF). In 1885, IGSF started manufacturing hunting weapons and tools. In 1891, IGSF started mass-producing the Mosin–Nagant rifle. The IGSF also started using DC generators to produce electricity to illuminate the plant as well as to power the machines. The IGSF was the only Russian enterprise that produced firearms for all branches of the Russian military. Thanks to the IGSF, Izhevsk became a large industrial center in Russia.

=== World War I and the Interwar Period ===
During the First World War, IGSF supplied the Imperial Russian Army with over 1.4 million new rifles and approximately 188,000 remelted shoulder weapons. Prior to the Russian Revolution, the IGSF took leading positions of the Russian defense industry in terms of manufacturing and manpower capacity. By 1917, about 34,000 people worked at IGSF. In 1918, a design bureau was established in the IGSF.
After the formation of the Soviet Union in 1922, large changes came to the IGSF. The state&#x27;s first hunting gun factory was opened on the enterprise&#x27;s premises in the same year. The IGSF required more highly trained personnel in order to accommodate new production and to work on newer machines. Thus, by 1929, IGSF-bound personnel had to be trained at the Izhevsk Technical School. In 1930, a new open-hearth furnace was put into operation and in-house production of machines at the factory was launched.

More re-organization took place in the 1930s, including the conversion of the IGSF into a Chief Designer Bureau, as well as the adoption and production of several new models of firearms: a modified Mosin–Nagant rifle design of 1891/1930, the battle rifle AVS-36, made by Sergei Simonov, and the SVT-38 self-loading rifle and the TT pistol, made by Fedor Tokorev. This gave rise to a flow line method of production. In 1938, the conveyor belt was implemented into the assembly of gun barrels and other parts, greatly increasing the production rate of firearms for the Soviet Army. In 1933, a New Design Bureau, &quot;BNK&quot;, was established at the factory to develop and modify firearms. Today, the bureau is named the &quot;Armory Design Center&quot; (KOC). In the bureau&#x27;s lifetime, about 300 models of small-arms, air ordnance, sport, hunting weapons, and other types of equipment were developed, most of which was in series production at the plant. In 1939, the main plant of the IGSF, Plant No. 180,was split into two independent enterprises: Metallurgical Plant No. 71 and Engineering Plant No. 74, which manufactured weapons. Engineering Plant No. 74 would later be renamed the Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant, or simply, Izhmash.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, Engineering Plant No. 74 served as the main firearm manufacturer for the Soviet Armed Forces. Since Operation Barbarossa left the Soviet Union in a very desperate position, the plant produced as many firearms as it was physically capable of, more firearms than its lifespan for 92 years prior. From 1941 to 1942, the plant set up mass production of Vasily Degtyarev&#x27;s PTRD anti-tank rifle, Sergei Simonov&#x27;s PTRS-41 anti-tank rifle, the Berezin UB aircraft machine gun armament, the 37mm Shpitalny Sh-37 and Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 aircraft guns, and sniper rifles with optic sights, along with the TT pistol and the Nagant M1895 revolver. A total of 11,450,000 rifles and carbines were produced in the plant, exceeding all the combined German firearm manufacturers&#x27; outputs of 10.3 million. Besides firearms, the plant also produced over 15,000 aircraft guns and over 130,000 anti-tank weapons.

On 20 July 1942, Plant No. 622 separated itself from Plant No. 74, using equipment transferred from the evacuated mechanical plants at Tula and Podolsk. During the war, the plant manufactured more than 1 million pistols and 200,000 anti-tank rifles. Plant No. 622 would later be renamed as the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, or simply, Izhmekh.

=== Post-World War II ===
After World War II, the Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant later recovered the production of its civilian arms and transportation. The plant also hired war veteran and ex-tank driver and mechanic, Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, after noticing his submachine gun design that gave him distinction as a gun designer. In 1947, Kalashnikov created his assault rifle, the 7.62×39mm AK-47. The AK-47 became the standard rifle of the Soviet Army in the same year, and later grew popular around the world. The AK-47 gave the plant fame and newer potential in the arms industry. The plant also created newer hunting weapons based out of the Mosin–Nagant rifle as well as sporting weapons. These sporting weapons helped the Soviet Union&#x27;s team to win shooting competitions in European championships and the Summer Olympic Games numerous times.

Kalashnikov later designed newer firearms: the AKM and the AK-74 assault rifle, the RPK light machine gun, and the PK belt-fed machine gun. These firearms helped contribute to greater firepower for the Soviet Army as well as numerous nations that had imported them. Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant gun designer Yevgeny Dragunov also help contribute to the plant&#x27;s fame by creating his SVD sniper rifle. Designed in 1963 and based out of sporting rifles, the SVD became the squad support weapon for the Soviet Army in the same year as well as starting a new trend of semi-automatic sniper rifles.

In 1975, the Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant changed its name to the Izhmash Industrial Association.

=== Contemporary Era ===
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Izhmash struggled with a decline in demand and competition with overseas firearm manufacturers. As a result, Izhmash created the Saiga semi-automatic rifle, and started producing the Tigr, a civilian version of the SVD which was created back in the 1970s, in batches. Izhmash also expanded to the Western market, which was extremely successful, especially with the Saiga. Izhmash also created two new sniper rifles, the SV-98 and the SV-99, which had a more enhanced fire precision than the regular SVD, for special units of the Russian Armed Forces.

Despite the success, by 2008, Izhmash was composed of numerous enterprises that were on the verge of bankruptcy. The Russian state corporation, Rostekhnologii (Russian Technologies, now Rostec), revealed the poor state Izhmash was in by 2010. Only 32 companies of Izhmash were actually operating with a multi-level management system, high overheads and doubled up functions. The combined liability of Izhmash in early 2011 was ₽19 billion. The use of the existing modern equipment hardly exceeded 20%.

As a result, Rostec took control of Izhmash and started restructuring and consolidating the company in 2011. According to Rostec, one of the objectives was to retain its research, industrial and human resources and turn Izhmash into a leading global small arms manufacturer. Izhmash was later reestablished through assets consolidation by 2012. As a result, there was a threefold increase in profits and a 10% cut in costs. In 2011, Izhmash increased the utilization rate of modern multipurpose equipment from 20% to 70%. The effect from the efforts to enhance production performance amounts to ₽100 million.

=== Kalashnikov Concern ===
On 13 August 2013, Izhmash and Izhmekh (formerly Izhevsk Mechanical Plant) merged, with the new concern named Kalashnikov Concern. Thanks to the merger, Kalashnikov Concern is Russia&#x27;s largest and most important arms manufacturer.

In July 2014, Kalashnikov Concern was sanctioned by the United States and the European Union as a result of the Russian annexation of Crimea and Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Since Europe and the United States were the largest customers of the concern&#x27;s civilian firearms, the concern was forced to rethink its marketing strategy. The concern opened five new markets and started selling its civilian firearms to ten new foreign countries, which helped the concern make up for its losses.

In the same year, Kalashnikov Concern has presented &quot;Strategy 2020&quot;, which includes technical re-equipment and production modernization. When implemented, the project will qualitatively improve production technology and greatly reduce running costs and energy consumption while also improving working conditions and overall productivity.

On 9 February 2017, Rostec&#x27;s management board gave permission to transfer Kalashnikov Concern to private investors. As of now, Rostec owns 26% of the concern while private investors own 74%.

In 2022, the Concern had reportedly achieved a 40% record yearly increase in weapons production for domestic needs and for export and also completed one licensed production agreement. The Concern reported in May 2023 that it had achieved a 10-year record in weapons deliveries during the first quarter of the year and that it has established a drone production unit. It was reported in late August 2023 that the production of 9K121 Vikhr, Strela and Kitolov missiles rose almost 1.5 fold. The company said in January 2024 that the government contracts for sniper rifles had increased by 8 times in the past year. It was also said that the production of &quot;special equipment&quot; increased by 45% in 2023 and the production of combat pistols by 5 times. The company reported in February 2024 that the production of drones has increased by 60% since 2022. Kalashnikov reported in May 2024 that during the first quarter of the year it had increased the civilian production output by 50% and the firearms production by 9% at comparison with the same period of 2023 and also raised revenues by 37% and started to supply upgraded AK-12 assault rifles of the 2023 model. In the next month, the Concern reportedly started supplies of the civilian electrically-powered and VTOL Legionnaire drone which is used for cargo delivery, terrain sensing and video monitoring. Supplies of the Stena special vehicles begun in July 2024. On 22 July 2024, the company claimed that production of military and civilian goods has increased by 50% during the first half of the year. On 3 October 2024, the company reported that it is ramping up the production of aircraft guns because of a multiple growth of order volumes. On 22 November 2024, the company stated that it had completed the 2024 state order for small arms ahead of schedule. On 28 January 2025, the Kalashnikov reported that it had achieved a 10-year record high revenue from export contracts for both military and civilian small arms in 2024.

==Products==
=== Izhevsk Arsenal ===
Although the arsenal was under construction in 1807, production of weapons immediately started: mainly long guns, pistols, and backswords. One notable long gun the arsenal made was the No. 15 17.7mm muskets, of which 6,000 of them were supplied to the Imperial Russian Army. The arsenal later manufactured rifles, muskets, carbines, and flint blunderbusses for cavalry in 1809. The venture also produced pistols and gun parts and remelted trophy weapons. Firearms were produced at a rapid pace for the Russian Army during the Napoleonic Wars, mainly in the French invasion of Russia, even though construction of the armory had not been finished yet. During the first four years, the factory produced 2,000 long guns. In 1814, the output grew up to 10,000 guns and almost 2,500 backswords. By 1830, the armory achieved the desired annual output of 25,000 long guns and 5,000 backswords.

Starting in the 1830s, the armory started manufacturing &quot;Gartung&quot; short rifles, &quot;Phalis&quot; breech-loading rifles, and boarding guns for the Baltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy. In 1835, the armory transferred cold steel production of swords and lances to Zlatoust, focusing mainly on firearm production. In 1844, the armory started upgrading current guns into more rapid firing percussion muskets. The armory also started using the caplock mechanism for its products in 1845. During the Crimean War, Izhevsk supplied the Russian Imperial Army with 130,000 rifles, with a third of them grooved. By 1857, 50 years after the creation of the armory, over 670,000 flintlock firearms, over 220,000 percussion firearms, over 58 thousand rifles, as well as a plentiful number of swords and lances were produced. When the methods of high-quality steel production were well mastered, Izhevsk became the source of gun barrels and barrel receivers for Russian plants. For example, armory enterprises in Tula used annually up to 360,000 barrels from the armory at Izhevsk.

In 1867, the armory was reorganized into a lease and a private commercial enterprise. At this time, the armory were renovated and it was equipped with steam-engines, new machines, and an open-hearth furnace. This allowed the armory to produce more breech-loading weapons for the Russian Imperial Army, notably the &quot;Krnk&quot; and &quot;Berdan&quot; type rifles. The Berdan rifle, designed by American firearm expert and inventor Hiram Berdan, became the standard-issue rifle of the Imperial Russian Army in 1870. The Berdan rifle was the most produced firearm of the plant at the time as well, allowing Russia to approach the European industrial empires&#x27; level of armaments.
=== Izhevsk Gun and Steel Factories ===
In 1884, the plant was returned to the state and became Izhevsk Gun and Steel Factories (IGSF). In 1885, IGSF started manufacturing hunting weapons and tools. In 1891, IGSF started mass-producing the Mosin–Nagant bolt-action military rifle in a development of nine years, based on the design of the 1898 Mauser rifle (Gewehr 98) with new unique features such as a push feed recessed bolt head. In addition to being one of the most produced rifles in mass-produced military bolt-action rifles in history, the Nagant is also used in every war from the time it was developed to the modern day. The rifle was produced from both the Imperial period and the Soviet era, with military production concluded in 1965, but production for civilian use is continued to the modern day. In addition to the Mosin–Nagant rifle, Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant, who was a co-inventor of, developed the Nagant M1895 revolver. The revolver has a unique &quot;gas-seal&quot; system that provides a boost to muzzle velocity as well as make the weapon suppressed. The sidearm, like the Nagant rifle, was produced in the Soviet era as well, and was mass-produced and used widespread.

====Kalashnikov CV-1====
On 23 August 2018, Kalashnikov Concern introduced a new electric car prototype, the CV-1. Its exterior design was based on the rare 1970s Soviet large family car IZh 2125 &quot;Kombi&quot;. The range on one charge was claimed to be 350 km.

====Kalashnikov UV-4====
Alongside the reveal of the CV-1, Kalashnikov also showed a prototype for the UV-4 4-door electric quadricycle, with a taxi variant being revealed in August 2019. The UV-4 was shown again in patent images later in November 2021, this time along with a 3-wheel, 2-door vehicle based on it.

<text>Julius Robert von Mayer (25 November 1814 – 20 March 1878) was a German physician, chemist, and physicist and one of the founders of thermodynamics. He is best known for enunciating in 1841 one of the original statements of the conservation of energy or what is now known as one of the first versions of the first law of thermodynamics, namely that &quot;energy can be neither created nor destroyed&quot;. In 1842, Mayer described the vital chemical process now referred to as oxidation as the primary source of energy for any living creature. He also proposed that plants convert light into chemical energy.

His achievements were overlooked and priority for the discovery in 1842 of the &quot;mechanical equivalent of heat&quot; was attributed to James Joule in the following year.

== Early life ==

Mayer was born on 25 November 1814 in Heilbronn, Württemberg (Baden-Württemberg, modern day Germany), the son of a pharmacist. He grew up in Heilbronn. After completing his &quot;Abitur&quot;, he studied medicine at the University of Tübingen, where he was a member of the &quot;Corps Guestphalia&quot;, a German Student Corps. During 1838 he attained his doctorate as well as passing the &quot;Staatsexamen&quot;. After a stay in Paris (1839/40) he left as a ship&#x27;s physician on a Dutch three-mast sailing ship for a journey to Jakarta.

Although he had hardly been interested before this journey in physical phenomena, his observation that storm-whipped waves are warmer than the calm sea started him thinking about the physical laws, in particular about the physical phenomenon of warmth and the question &quot;whether the directly developed heat alone (the heat of combustion), or the sum of the quantities of heat developed in direct and indirect ways are to be accounted for in the burning process&quot;. After his return in February 1841 Mayer dedicated his efforts to solve this problem.

In 1841 he settled in Heilbronn and married.

== Development of ideas ==
Even as a young child, Mayer showed an intense interest with various mechanical mechanisms. He was a young man who performed various experiments of the physical and chemical variety. In fact, one of his favorite hobbies was creating various types of electrical devices and air pumps. It was obvious that he was intelligent. Hence, Mayer attended Eberhard-Karls University in May 1832. He studied medicine during his time there.

In 1837, he and some of his friends were arrested for wearing the couleurs of a forbidden organization. The consequences for this arrest included a one year expulsion from the college and a brief period of incarceration. This diversion sent Mayer traveling to Switzerland, France, and the Dutch East Indies. Mayer drew some additional interest in mathematics and engineering from his friend Carl Baur through private tutoring. In 1841, Mayer returned to Heilbronn to practice medicine, but physics became his new passion.

In June 1841 he completed his first scientific paper entitled &quot;On the Quantitative and Qualitative Determination of Forces&quot;. It was largely ignored by other professionals in the area. Then, Mayer became interested in the area of heat and its motion. He presented a value in numerical terms for the mechanical equivalent of heat. He also was the first person to describe the vital chemical process now referred to as oxidation as the primary source of energy for any living creature.

In 1848 he calculated that in the absence of a source of energy the Sun would cool down in only 5000 years, and he suggested that the impact of meteorites kept it hot.

Since he was not taken seriously at the time, his achievements were overlooked and credit was given to James Joule. Mayer almost committed suicide after he discovered this fact. He spent some time in mental institutions to recover from this and the loss of some of his children. Several of his papers were published due to the advanced nature of the physics and chemistry. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1859 by the philosophical faculty at the University of Tübingen. His overlooked work was revived in 1862 by fellow physicist John Tyndall in a lecture at the London Royal Institution. In July 1867 Mayer published &quot;Die Mechanik der Wärme.&quot; This publication dealt with the mechanics of heat and its motion. On 5 November 1867 Mayer was awarded personal nobility by the Kingdom of Württemberg (von Mayer) which is the German equivalent of a British knighthood. von Mayer died in Germany in 1878.

After Sadi Carnot stated it for caloric, Mayer was the first person to state the law of the conservation of energy, one of the most fundamental tenets of modern day physics. The law of the conservation of energy states that the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant in any isolated system of objects that interact with each other only by way of forces that are conservative.
Mayer&#x27;s first attempt at stating the conservation of energy was a paper he sent to Johann Christian Poggendorff&#x27;s &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;, in which he postulated a conservation of force (&quot;Erhaltungssatz der Kraft&quot;). However, owing to Mayer&#x27;s lack of advanced training in physics, it contained some fundamental mistakes and was not published. Mayer continued to pursue the idea steadfastly and argued with the Tübingen physics professor Johann Gottlieb Nörremberg, who rejected his hypothesis. Nörremberg did, however, give Mayer a number of valuable suggestions on how the idea could be examined experimentally; for example, if kinetic energy transforms into heat energy, water should be warmed by vibration.

Mayer not only performed this demonstration, but determined also the quantitative factor of the transformation, calculating the mechanical equivalent of heat. The result of his investigations was published 1842 in the May edition of Justus von Liebig&#x27;s &quot;Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie&quot;. It was translated as &quot;Remarks on the Forces of Inorganic Nature&quot; In his booklet &quot;Die organische Bewegung im Zusammenhang mit dem Stoffwechsel&quot; (&quot;The Organic Movement in Connection with the Metabolism&quot;, 1845) he specified the numerical value of the mechanical equivalent of heat: at first as 365 kgf·m/kcal, later as 425 kgf·m/kcal; the modern values are 4.184 kJ/kcal (426.6 kgf·m/kcal) for the thermochemical calorie and 4.1868 kJ/kcal (426.9 kgf·m/kcal) for the international steam table calorie.

This relation implies that, although work and heat are different forms of energy, they can be transformed into one another. This law is now called the first law of thermodynamics, and led to the formulation of the general principle of conservation of energy, definitively stated by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847.

=== Mayer&#x27;s relation ===

Mayer derived a relation between specific heat at constant pressure and the specific heat at constant volume for an ideal gas. The relation is:

formula_1,

where &quot;CP,m&quot; is the molar specific heat at constant pressure, &quot;CV,m&quot; is the molar specific heat at constant volume and &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant.

== Later life ==
Mayer was aware of the importance of his discovery, but his inability to express himself scientifically led to degrading speculation and resistance from the scientific establishment. Contemporary physicists rejected his principle of conservation of energy, and even acclaimed physicists Hermann von Helmholtz and James Prescott Joule viewed his ideas with hostility. The former doubted Mayer&#x27;s qualifications in physical questions, and a bitter dispute over priority developed with the latter.

In 1848 two of his children died rapidly in succession, and Mayer&#x27;s mental health deteriorated. He attempted suicide on 18 May 1850 and was committed to a mental institution. After he was released, he was a broken man and only timidly re-entered public life in 1860. However, in the meantime, his scientific fame had grown and he received a late appreciation of his achievement, although perhaps at a stage where he was no longer able to enjoy it.

He continued to work vigorously as a physician until his death.

== Honors ==
* 1840 Mayer received the Knight Cross of the Order of the Crown (Württemberg).
* 1869 Mayer received the &quot;prix Poncelet&quot;.
* The &quot;Robert-Mayer-Gymnasium&quot; and the &quot;Robert-Mayer-Volks- und Schulsternwarte&quot; in Heilbronn bear his name.

In chemistry, he invented Mayer&#x27;s reagent which is used in detecting alkaloids.

<doc id="585103" wikidata="Q5433722" url="?curid=585103" title="Fandango Media">
<text>Fandango Media, LLC is an American ticketing company that sells movie tickets via their website and their mobile app. It also owns Fandango at Home (formerly owned by Walmart and originally known as Vudu), a streaming digital video store and streaming service, as well as Rotten Tomatoes, which provides television and streaming media information. It is a joint venture between NBCUniversal (a division of Comcast) and Warner Bros. Discovery (formerly WarnerMedia).

==History==
In 2000, Cline, with Art Levitt, founded Fandango. In 2003, Fandango secured $15 million in funding from venture capitalists Technology Crossover Ventures. Fandango was privately held. Then-owners included exhibition chains (Loews Cineplex Entertainment, Regal Cinemas, Carmike Cinemas, Cinemark Theatres, General Cinema Theatres, Edwards Theatres and Century Theatres) and venture capital firms (&quot;Accretive Technology Partners&quot; and &quot;General Atlantic Partners&quot;).

On April 11, 2007, Comcast acquired Fandango, with plans to integrate it into a new entertainment website called &quot;Fancast.com&quot;, set to launch the summer of 2007. In June 2008, the domain Movies.com was acquired from Disney. In March 2012, Fandango announced a partnership with Yahoo! Movies, making Fandango the official online and mobile ticketer for registered users of the Yahoo! service. That October, Paul Yanover was named President of Fandango.

Fandango made its first international acquisition in September 2015 when it bought the Brazilian ticketing company Ingresso, which provides ticketing to a variety of Brazilian entertainment events, including the biannual Rock in Rio festival. On January 29, 2016, Fandango announced its acquisition of M-GO, a joint venture between Technicolor SA and DreamWorks Animation (NBCUniversal acquired the latter company three months later), which it would later rebrand as &quot;FandangoNOW&quot;.
In February 2016, Fandango announced its acquisition of Flixster and Rotten Tomatoes from Time Warner&#x27;s Warner Bros. Entertainment. As part of the deal, Warner Bros. would become a 30% shareholder of the combined Fandango company. Its stake was reduced to 25% by 2019.

In December 2016, Fandango Media purchased Cinepapaya, a Peru-based website for purchasing movie tickets, for an undisclosed amount. Later that same month, Fandango moved to Fox Interactive Media&#x27;s former headquarters in Beverly Hills. On April 20, 2020, Walmart entered into an agreement to sell Vudu to Fandango Media. The sale was completed on July 6, 2020. Vudu was rebranded as Fandango at Home in 2024. On July 16, 2024, Fandango founder J. Michael Cline died by suicide at the age of 64.

==Services==
Fandango&#x27;s website also offers exclusive film clips, trailers, celebrity interviews, reviews by users, movie descriptions, and some web-based games to Fandango members. As of March 5, 2015, Fandango provides members the ability to refund or exchange their orders up to 2 hours before the showtime of their film.Fandango&#x27;s Android app was listed among Techland&#x27;s 50 Best Android Applications for 2013.

==Competition==
Until its acquisition of its rival MovieTickets.com in 2017, Fandango was one of three major online advance movie ticket sale sites, along with MovieTickets.com and Atom Tickets. Before being acquired by Comcast in April 2007, Fandango was privately owned; its major stakeholder, Regal Cinemas, which owned the United Artists and Hoyts theater chains, was the second largest movie-theater chain in the U.S. Regal and its partners founded Fandango partly to prevent the older MovieTickets.com from establishing a monopoly on phone and online ticketing services. (MovieTickets.com was publicly owned and traded under the stock symbol HOLL.) The company&#x27;s advertising agency reportedly chose the name &quot;Fandango&quot; because it sounded &quot;fun, kinetic and smart&quot;, and &quot;easily pronounce[d] and remember[ed]--even though it really has nothing to do with movies.&quot;

Prior to 2012, Fandango did not provide online ticketing for many AMC Theatres. However, it provided online ticketing for AMC Theatres that were originally part of the Loews Cineplex Entertainment chain, due to contractual obligations in place prior to the 2005 merger of the two movie chains. Loews had previously attempted to break the contract in 2002 under pressure of bankruptcy and from (then) AOL Moviefone and its partner, Loews&#x27; Cineplex subsidiary; Fandango successfully sued both Loews and Moviefone and retained Loews&#x27; business. As of February 8, 2012, Fandango began providing ticketing for all AMC Theatres in the US, after which MovieTickets.com&#x27;s fellow shareholders sued AMC for breach of contract. AMC and MovieTickets.com settled in 2013, with an agreement that the theater chain&#x27;s online ticketing would be available on both Fandango and MovieTickets.com. In May 2012, Fandango announced a partnership with Moviefone, MovieTickets.com&#x27;s former partner. Atom Tickets, a movie ticketing app and website launched in 2014, has been called a &quot;serious competitor&quot; of Fandango&#x27;s.

==Controversies==
In July 2009, it was revealed that Fandango and other websites, including buy.com and Orbitz, were linked with controversial Web loyalty programs, also known as post-transaction marketers. Fandango reportedly gave the third party access to Fandango customers&#x27; credit cards. In December 2013, Fandango launched a trademark dispute when WWE tried to trademark the name for use by the professional wrestler Fandango (né Johnny Curtis).

In August 2014, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved final orders settling charges against Fandango for misrepresenting to the public the security of their mobile app and for failing to protect the transmission of Fandango customers&#x27; sensitive personal information. The Fandango mobile app assured consumers, during checkout, that their credit card information was stored and transmitted securely. However, the FTC claims against Fandango focused on failures relating to both the implementation and testing of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates for 4 years following the mobile app&#x27;s launch in March 2009. According to the FTC, Fandango commissioned security audits in 2011, but the audits were limited in scope and did not review the security of the app&#x27;s transmission of information. The FTC also alleged that Fandango did not implement effective channels for security complaints and instead relied on its general customer service system to handle security vulnerability reporting.

Rotten Tomatoes has received several criticisms relating to its scoring. In October 2015, FiveThirtyEight published a story and podcast calling Fandango&#x27;s metrics on user ratings into question. The investigation noted that the site&#x27;s method for calculating ratings made it rare for a movie to ever receive an overall rating below three stars. The problem seemingly extended from Fandango&#x27;s habit of rounding ratings up to the nearest half. Fandango, in response, noted that this was a glitch it was working to repair. Nevertheless, Gizmodo cited the study after Fandango announced the purchase of Rotten Tomatoes amid fears that the purchase would &quot;ruin&quot; the site. Other complaints have concerned apparent political bias, with an analysis of Rotten Tomatoes scores seemingly preferencing films which exhibit progressive values and down-rating conservative ones. Other criticisms suggest score manipulation for commercial reasons: in 2012, 32 million audience votes suddenly appeared for the Star Wars film &#x27;Revenge of the Sith&#x27;, in what was called by Screenrant &quot;a clear example of nefarious manipulation&quot;.

In December 2017, Fandango received hundreds of complaints regarding its delivery of &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; tickets. &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that issues began within hours of advanced sales&#x27; becoming available for the new &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, with customers complaining of long wait times and website glitches.

==Video on demand==
In early 2016, Fandango acquired M-GO, which was re-branded FandangoNOW. Fandango later purchased Vudu in July 2020. FandangoNOW later merged with Vudu on August 3, 2021. Fandango chose to retain the &quot;Vudu&quot; name as it was the larger service with a loyal customer base.

<doc id="585105" wikidata="Q327486" url="?curid=585105" title="John Lehman">
<text>John Francis Lehman Jr. (born September 14, 1942) is an American private equity investor and writer who was secretary of the Navy (1981–1987) during the Reagan administration in which he promoted the creation of a 600-ship navy.

Lehman is on the board of trustees for the thinktank Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI). Lehman was also, from 2003 to 2004, a member of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, commonly called the 9/11 Commission, and signed policy letters produced by the Project for the New American Century. He was also an advisor to Senator John McCain for the 2008 presidential race, and for Senator Mitt Romney in his 2012 bid.

==Education and family==
Lehman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Constance (Cruice) and John Francis Lehman, an industrial engineer and decorated US Navy veteran (Lieutenant Commander). He graduated from La Salle College High School and received a B.S. in international relations from Saint Joseph&#x27;s University in 1964, gained a B.A. from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (later elevated to an M.A.), and went on to earn an M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.

He is a first cousin once removed of Grace Kelly (Princess Grace of Monaco), and is Chairman of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, a public charity established after Princess Grace&#x27;s death to support emerging artists in film, dance, and theater. He led the American delegation to the funeral of Prince Rainier. He and his family live in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and in Manhattan. He is a long-time Republican.

==Military career==
Lehman was in the U.S. Air Force Reserve for three years in Cambridge and in 1968 left the Air Force Reserve and joined the United States Naval Reserve as an ensign. He later rose to the rank of commander as a naval flight officer on the A-6 Intruder as a bombardier/navigator. He was on the staff of the National Security Council under Henry Kissinger.

In 1977, Lehman founded the Abington Corporation, a consulting company with clients including defense companies such as Northrop Corporation. He remained its president and director until 1981, when he was appointed by Ronald Reagan to be Secretary of the Navy.

===Secretary of the Navy (1981–1987)===
As the 65th secretary, appointed by Reagan in 1981, Lehman launched the idea of building a &quot;600-ship navy&quot;. He became Secretary of the Navy at 38, a young age of which he was conscious in his dealing with admirals. He was unique in still being a commander in the Naval Reserve and on active flight status while he was secretary. He developed a strategic concept to counter the threat of Soviet incursion into Western Europe known as the &quot;Lehman Doctrine&quot;. The plan called for a military response to any Soviet invasion in Europe by attacking and invading the Soviet Far East along the Pacific, a much less-defended front. Forces would sever the Trans-Siberian Railway and fight westward toward Moscow.

As a naval aviator, Lehman was a massive supporter of aircraft carrier power. His works as a lobbyist and author in the 1970s led him naturally to support a resurgence of US naval aviation under Reagan. His support for the 600-ship navy and promotion of the US Maritime Strategy are hallmarks of that, as are his reactivation of the four s. Both the carriers and the battleships were to announce the United States&#x27; overcoming of recent Soviet potential superiority by being capable of taking a war to the Soviet Union&#x27;s doorstep.

According to Hedrick Smith in his book &quot;The Power Game&quot;, Lehman lost a fight at the Pentagon with the deputy secretary of defense, W. Paul Thayer, over reducing the number of future aircraft carriers planned. Lehman immediately went to the White House, which was unaware of Thayer&#x27;s decision, and obtained a press release, declaring that Reagan had named two of the ships and , which implied that Reagan had endorsed the 600-ship navy. Lehman was also instrumental in the forced retirement (from retired-retained status) of the Director of Naval Reactors (DNR), Admiral Hyman G. Rickover.

Lehman sided with General Dynamics after it had falsified inspection records to hide welding flaws on submarines and pushed a settlement that paid over 600 million dollars for what Rickover called shoddy work.

Lehman reportedly engaged in a sexual act with a stripper in front of 50 to 100 spectators in a hospitality suite at the Tailhook Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1986, and had been seen cavorting with strippers at earlier Tailhook conventions. In the Department of Defense Inspector General investigation report on the 1991 Tailhook convention, Lehman is not mentioned by name in reference to the 1986 incident. When asked about the incident on May 26, 1996, by ABC Television journalists Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, Lehman responded, &quot;I have to say that the description is far more lurid than the fact.&quot;

Lehman resigned as SECNAV in 1987. He was then promoted to the rank of captain in the US Naval Reserve in 1989 and later retired from the US Navy as a reserve officer in that rank after 30 years of service. On October 13, 2020, the US Navy announced that it was naming the next after him. The is under construction.

==Later career==
Lehman was a former investment banker with UBS AG, Paine Webber, and the president of Abington Corporation. , Lehman is chairman of the private equity investment firm J. F. Lehman and Company, as well as chairman of the Hawaii Superferry. Lehman is chairman of the board of OAO Technology Solutions Inc. He is also an honorary member of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry. , he is a member of a number of influential conservative American think tanks, including the Project for the New American Century, The Heritage Foundation, the Foreign Policy Research Institute, the Center for Security Policy and the Committee on the Present Danger.

After his work in the 9/11 Commission in 2002, there was increased speculation that Lehman might be named to a chief security post within the Bush administration. Positions suggested included Director of Central Intelligence, Director of National Intelligence and secretary of defense when Donald Rumsfeld stepped down. During the 2008 presidential election, Lehman was named a possible secretary of defense in the case of a John McCain victory over the winning Democratic nominee, Barack Obama.

He is currently the chairman of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA and is a director of the OpSail Foundation. He is also a member of the board of overseers of the School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, and is a trustee of La Salle College High School. He has been on the board of directors of the Ball Corporation since 1987. Lehman is also an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy.

<text>The Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré () is a basilica set along the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada, east of Quebec City, and one of the six national shrines of Canada. It has been credited by the Catholic Church with many miracles of curing the sick and disabled. It is an important Catholic sanctuary, which receives about a half-million pilgrims each year. Since 1933 they have included members of the Anna Fusco Pilgrimage from Connecticut. The peak period of pilgrimage is around July 26, the feast of Saint Anne, the patron saint of sailors.

==History==
The basilica in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré was initially a shrine to honour Saint Anne. On March 8, 1658, settler Étienne de Lessard donated two frontal acres from the west end of his property to the Catholic Church, so that a chapel could be built. This chapel eventually became the site of the modern-day basilica. The chapel was built to provide a place of worship for the new settlers in the area and to house a miraculous statue of St. Anne. The first reported miracle at the site happened during the shrine&#x27;s construction.

A man named Louis Guimont was hired to help build the shrine even though he suffered from rheumatism. After placing three stones upon the shrine&#x27;s foundation, Guimont was cured of all his ailments. This was followed by other testimonies of healed people, and the shrine soon grew in popularity. Many pilgrims came to the shrine hoping to receive a miracle while others, like Anne of Austria, wife of Louis XIII and Queen of France, supported the shrine from a distance. Because of the popularity of the shrine, the building was enlarged several times to accommodate all the pilgrims. In the late nineteenth century, a basilica was constructed around the shrine. In 1876, the first basilica opened for worship. 

This was destroyed in a fire on March 29, 1922. The present-day basilica was built in 1926 on the site of the prior church. Architects Maxime Roisin, Louis N. Audet and Joseph-Égilde-Césaire Daoust collaborated on the project from 1923 to 1931. After the end of the Great Depression, work on the interior resumed in 1937, and was finally completed in 1946.

Pilgrims are attracted from across Canada and the United States. Miracles are still believed to occur at the basilica. Two pillars near the entrance are filled with racks of crutches, canes, braces, and other signs of disabilities. Each item has been left by a pilgrim who reports being healed at the basilica.

The wooded hillside next to the basilica has a memorial chapel and a Way of the Cross, with life-sized Stations of the Cross. Higher up the hill the Convent of the Redemptoristines can be found. Built in 1906 and declared a historic site in 2001, it no longer operates as a convent and has essentially been abandoned in the early 21st century.

==Architecture==
The total length of the building is long, and wide; with a transept width of . The height of the building&#x27;s steeple is . 
===Interior===

Joseph-Émile Brunet designed twenty-four capitals (1948) for the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, which depict 52 religious subjects reflecting the life of Jesus. He sculpted 14 &quot;Stations of the Cross&quot; lining the walls of the cathedral, with stone statues of Saint Anne and Saints at the entrance of the cathedral. Joseph-Émile Brunet also created the fountain in front of the Basilica and the 7&#x27; 6&quot;-high stone sculpture in niches that can be seen on entering the basilica, &quot;Marie de L&#x27;Incarnation&quot;, &quot;Saint Joseph&quot;, &quot;The Virgin with Jesus&quot;, &quot;&quot;François de Laval&quot;, and &quot;St. Joachim&quot;, in addition to a bronze sculpture of Kateri Tekakwitha, 6&#x27; 4&quot; high.

<text>Rice and curry is a popular dish in Sri Lanka, as well as in other parts of the Indian subcontinent.

Rice and curry dinner comprises the following:

* A large bowl of rice, can be boiled or fried. Sometimes &quot;kiribath&quot;, rice cooked in coconut milk, is served.
* A vegetable curry, perhaps of green beans, jackfruit or leeks.
* A curry of meat, most often chicken or fish but occasionally goat or lamb
* Dhal, a dish of spiced lentils.
* Papadums, a thin crisp wafer made from legume or rice flour and served as a side dish.
* Sambals, which are fresh chutney side dishes; they may include red onion, chili, grated coconut and lime juice, and are often the hottest part of the meal.

Each bowl contains small portions, but as is traditional in most countries in tropical Asia, if a bowl is emptied, it is immediately refilled.

The curry uses chili peppers, cardamom, cumin, coriander and other spices. It has a distinctive taste. The Southern cuisines use ingredients like dried fish which are local to the area. The spicier preparations are believed to be among the world&#x27;s hottest in terms of chili content (second only to Sylheti). 

While natives are born into this cuisine and develop a tolerance to spicy food, many visitors and tourists to the country often find the spiciness excessive. As a result, many local restaurants in developed and tourist areas offer special low-spice versions of local foods to cater to foreign palates or have an alternative &quot;Western&quot; menu for visitors and tourists.

<text>National parks of Canada are vast natural spaces located throughout the country that are protected by Parks Canada, a government agency. Parks Canada manages the National Parks and Reserves in order to protect and preserve the Canadian wildlife and habitat that fall within the ecosystems of the park, keep them safe, educate visitors, and ensure public enjoyment in ways that do not compromise the area for future generations. The areas that fall within Parks Canada&#x27;s governance include a wide range of protected areas, encompassing National Historic Sites, National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCA), and National Park Reserves. Canada established its first national park in Banff in 1885, and has since expanded its national park system to include 37 national parks and 11 national park reserves.

== Early History of Canada&#x27;s National Parks ==
Canada&#x27;s first national park, located in Banff, was established in 1885. Tourism and commercialization dominated early park development, followed closely by resource extraction. Commodifying the parks to profit Canada&#x27;s national economy as well as conserving the natural areas for public and future use became an integrated method of park creation. The process of establishing national parks has often forced the displacement of Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents of areas within the proposed park boundaries. Conflicts between the creation of parks and the residents of the area have been negotiated through co-management practices, as Parks Canada acknowledged the importance of community involvement in order to sustain a healthy ecosystem.

The transition towards developing parks as a place of preservation began with the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; of 1930. This event marked a shift in park management practices. Revised in 1979 under the National Parks Policy, the Act placed greater emphasis on preserving the natural areas in an unimpaired state through ecological integrity and restoration, moving away from development based heavily on profit. Acting as national symbols, Canada&#x27;s national parks exist in every province and territory representing a variety of landscapes that mark Canada&#x27;s natural heritage.

*2024 - Pituamkek National Park Reserve is established, and is Canada&#x27;s newest national park.
==Creation and development==
On July 20, 1871, the Crown Colony of British Columbia committed to Confederation with Canada. Under the union&#x27;s terms, Canada was to begin construction of a transcontinental railway to connect the Pacific Coast to the eastern provinces. As the Canadian Pacific Railway surveyors began to study the land in 1875, the location of the country&#x27;s natural resources sprouted further interest. Evidence of minerals quickly introduced the construction of mines and resource exploitation in Canada&#x27;s previously untouched wilderness. Exploration led to the discovery of hot springs near Banff, Alberta, and in November 1885, the Canadian Government made the springs public property, protecting them from possible private ownership and exploitation. This event brought about the beginning of Canada&#x27;s movement towards preserving land and setting it aside for public usage as national parks. By the late 1880s, Thomas White, Canada&#x27;s Minister of the Interior, responsible for federal land management, Indian affairs, and natural resources extraction, began establishing a legislative motion towards establishing Canada&#x27;s first national park in Banff.

May 1911 marked one of the most significant events in the administration and development of national parks in Canada as the &quot;Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act&quot; received royal assent. This law saw the creation of the first administrative body, the Dominion Parks Branch, now known as Parks Canada, to administer national parks in Canada. With the Branch in place, the parks system expanded from Banff eastward, combining both use and protection as the foundation to national park management.

The major motives behind the creation of national parks in Canada were profit and preservation. Inspired by the establishment and success of Yellowstone National Park in the United States, Canada blended the conflicting ideas of preservation and commercialism in order to satisfy its natural resource needs, conservationist views of modern management, a growing public interest in the outdoors and the new popularity of getting back to nature. This growing interest to escape the hustle and bustle of the city brought about ideas of conserving Canada&#x27;s unspoiled wildernesses by creating public parks. As a country dependent on natural resources, Canada&#x27;s national parks represent a compromise between the demand for profit from the land&#x27;s resources and tourism and the need for preservation and sustainable development.

While conservationist ideas and a Canadian desire towards getting back to nature were evident in the early development of national parks in Canada, a greater role was played by chambers of commerce, local governments, promoters of tourism, and recreational groups who advocated for profit-driven commercial development, while incorporating wildlife preservation when possible. Canada&#x27;s national parks allowed the public an avenue into nature, while also integrating ideas of preserving Canada&#x27;s scenic landscape and wildlife populations in an era of development and major resource extraction.

===Tourism and commercialization===

The integration of public visitation for national parks in Canada heavily contributed to the beginnings of public constituencies for certain parks. The parks who mobilized with a public constituency tended to prosper at a faster rate. As a tactic to increase the number of people travelling to and through national parks, members of each constituency surrounding national parks began to advocate for the construction of well-built roads, including the development of the Trans-Canada Highway. As the main highway travelling through the Canadian Rockies, the Trans-Canada Highway has provided accessible visitation and commerce to the area. The highway is designed to provide a heavy flow of traffic, while also including many accessible pull-offs and picnic areas. With a high frequency of travelers and many destinations to stop, tourism boomed after the Trans-Canada Highway was established. As the highway travels through Banff and the Bow Valley area, it includes scenic views of most of the mountains, and an environment rich with wildlife.

With an increase in tourism to Rocky Mountain Park, growth and prosperity came to the town of Banff. The Banff hot springs were made more accessible after a tunnel was blasted in 1886. Horse-drawn carriages were replaced by buses and taxis, and by the 1960s small cabins had been largely replaced by hotels and motels as the community became geared towards building the national park as a tourist destination. In 1964, the first visitor service centre was established at Lake Louise Station, which included the development of a campground, trailer park, and other attractions. Cave and Basin Springs were forced to rebuild their bathing pools in 1904 and then again in 1912, because of growing public interest in the hot springs. By 1927, campground accommodations at Tunnel Mountain were adapting to include room for trailers as well as tents. Due to increased demand, the campground was extended, and by 1969 it was the biggest campground in the national park system. Banff became a year-round recreational centre as the growth of winter sport activities provided added incentive for tourism. The implementation of T-bars and chairlifts on Banff&#x27;s ski hills helped develop Banff into a ski and winter sports destination.

==Conflicts over creation==

===Resource development===
Since the inception of Canada&#x27;s national parks, business and profit has been a major element to their creation and development. Although tourism was the first source of profit in the national parks, the exploitation of natural resources such as coal, lumber, and other minerals became another major area of revenue. These resources were found in abundance in the Rocky Mountains and were interpreted as being inexhaustible.

Coal was the most plentiful and profitable of all the minerals and therefore its mining in parks was accepted by politicians and Canadian Pacific Railway officials. This was demonstrated by the creation of Bankhead, a coal town on the road to Lake Minnewanka. This coal town was not viewed as a detriment to the overall scenery of Banff National Park, but was instead an added attraction for visitors. In this case, resource exploitation and tourism worked in conjunction with each other to create a more profitable national park. Although tourism and resource development could work together, it was clear from policy making that tourism became secondary to resource exploitation.

The resources that were exploited from the national parks were essential to the CPR&#x27;s income as it freighted these resources across the country. In 1887, the &quot;Rocky Mountains Park Act&quot; was established under the Macdonald government and it reflected the importance of resource exploitation for Canada&#x27;s economy. Under this regulation, national parks were not fully preserved in their natural states as mining, logging and grazing continued to be permitted.

When the Rocky Mountains Park Bill was proposed, it elicited various criticisms at the time, one being the implicit contradiction between the exploitation of resources within this national reservation. However, the overarching nineteenth century ideology that lumbering and mining would contribute to the usefulness of the reserve as opposed to depreciating the park overshadowed the concerns of resource exploitation. The natural resources within the parks were seen as being unlimited and therefore should be used as it was economically beneficial for the nation.

By 1911, as Canadians became aware of the depletion occurring within America&#x27;s natural resources, a debate focused on the extent of resource exploitation in Canada&#x27;s national parks erupted. This debate began as early as 1906 at the Forestry Convention in Ottawa as it stimulated a new interest in conservation which spoke to the governmental, academic, and public level. Canada&#x27;s national parks were no longer places of unlimited natural resources, but were now considered a place where resources needed to be conserved through regulation to ensure future and continued use.

J.B. Harkin, the Parks Commissioner in 1911, advocated the complete eradication of coal and mineral extraction in the parks. However, Harkin&#x27;s vision did not come to fruition until 1930 when the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; was established. Under this act, mineral exploration and development were banned and only limited use of timber was permitted within the parks. For Canada to continue its economic success through resource development, the boundaries of Canada&#x27;s national parks were altered prior to the 1930 Act in order to exclude resource rich land from park areas. The exclusion of resource development in Canada&#x27;s national parks marked a minor shift towards preservationist attitudes over Canada&#x27;s parks as recreational use and development was still permitted.

===Human conflict===
The initial ideal of national parks was to create uninhabited wilderness. Creating this required the displacement of Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents who lived within the intended park boundaries, and restrictions on how these residents had previously used the land and resources within parks for subsistence.

Jasper National Park, established in 1907, restricted income-generating activities such as hunting, along with culturally valuable practices of the Aboriginal groups who had used the region. Jasper is a large park in the southern, frequently visited portion of Canada, and one of many parks geared towards tourism more than preservation. Most parks are designed to have the appeal of uninhabited wilderness while also having amenities and roads to facilitate visitors. Human activity within the park was allowed, but primarily only those activities that generated revenue, such as snowboarding and lodging for tourists. Some have claimed that the selection of which activities to allow had non-native bias, as it precluded traditional sources of subsistence such as hunting and trapping.

Parks in less frequently visited, northern parts of Canada were created with more consideration of Aboriginal usage. Kluane National Park and Reserve in the Yukon initially had restrictions on hunting in order to preserve the presence of wildlife in the park, as did Ivvavik National Park in the Northern Yukon. Through grassroots organizations and political lobbying, Indigenous residents of these areas were able to have greater influence over the process of park creation. For both Kluane and Ivvavik parks, Indigenous organizations protested and testified to Parliamentary Committees, describing how these restrictions infringed on their ability to provide for themselves through traditional fishing, hunting, and trapping. Ivvavik National Park, established in 1984, was the first in Canada to be created through a comprehensive land claim settlement, and set a precedent for collaboration and co-management in future parks. In June 1984, the Inuvialuit Final Agreement was signed, which deviated from past parks by committing to a more extensive inclusion of Aboriginal interests and gave the Inuvialuit exclusive rights to hunting and harvesting game within the park. This agreement was an example of and the beginning of co-management, which ensured that Indigenous voices would be heard and given equal representatives on parks boards.

Non-Indigenous groups were also dispossessed from their land during the creation of national parks, such as the Acadians of Kouchibouguac National Park in New Brunswick. This park was created in 1969 and included recognition of the Aboriginal groups who had once resided there but no recognition of the Acadians who comprised approximately 85 percent of the over 1,500 people who were displaced to create the park. Many inhabits dispossessed of their land by Parks Canada resisted, and the Acadian residents&#x27; resistance of eviction was extensive enough to delay the official opening of the park until 1979. Through protest and civil disobedience, they won greater compensation from the government to address the loss of fishing within the park that had previously been their main source of income. The resistance of the Acadians impacted future park creation, as in 1979 Parks Canada announced that it would no longer use forced relocation in new parks. An advisory committee was created by Parks Canada in 2008 to reflect on the Kouchibouguac process and address outstanding grievances.

==Shifting value behind park creation and management==

===Conservation movements===
In the late 19th century, Canadians changed their view of nature and resources as opinions started to focus on conservationist ideas. They were transitioning from a worldview of ecology and abundance to one where the environment acted as a limited resource.

Created in 1909, the Commission of Conservation became the Canadian forum for conservation issues, acting as an advisory and consultative body used to answer questions related to conservation and better utilization of Canada&#x27;s natural and human resources. The Commission focused on a concept that maximized future profits through good management in the present. Rather than preserving through non-use, the commission was concerned with managing resources for long-term gain.

Other conservation-minded organizations, like the Alpine Club, had different ideas that focused on the preservation of natural wilderness and opposed any type of development or construction. This movement was successful as the creation of parks solely for preservation purposes, like the bird sanctuary in Point Pelee, began developing. In order to push their views further, this movement, headed by James B. Harkin and Arthur Oliver Wheeler, was forced to argue that divine scenery was itself a source of profit – tourism – in order to push aside what they saw as a far greater avenue of exploitation: resource extraction. By 1930, even the conservation movements within Canada came to understand that the country&#x27;s national parks had an entrenched system of profit-based motives.

The Parks Canada Agency Act came into action in 1998 to ensure the protection of parks for further generations&#x27; use and national interest as places of cultural and historical importance.

===Ecological integrity===
According to Parks Canada, ecological integrity is a state with three elements: non-living elements, living elements, and a series of ecological functions. By having all three elements, a healthy ecosystem exists. Ecosystems in national parks have often been damaged due to the exploitation of resources, the expansion of tourism, and external land use practices outside national parks. Through Parks Canada realizing the necessity of managing national parks by human hands to maintain biotic and abiotic components, Parks Canada placed an emphasis on ecological integrity within the national parks that marked a shift from profit to preservation.

The change in values is derived from the establishment of 1930 &quot;National Parks Act&quot; that limited use of resource for park management, and in 1979, under revised National Parks Policy, the maintenance of ecological integrity was prioritized for the preservation of national parks of Canada. In 1988, the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; was amended and the regulation of ecological integrity was embodied. However, due to the conflicting interests of profit and preservation, the maintenance of ecological integrity has progressed slowly.

The big movement on maintenance of ecological integrity has happened since 2001. &quot;Canada National Parks Act&quot; of 2001 reinforced the necessity of maintenance and restorations of ecological integrity by saving natural resources and ecosystem. It sets new principles for park management plans. Wilderness areas in the Banff, Jasper, Yoho and Kootenay National Parks have been officially designated land as wilderness in national parks. The boundaries of all communities in national parks are changed and the developments of commerce in their communities are restricted. Profit no longer became priority and initiative for preservation through ecological integrity increased.

To maintain or restore ecological integrity, ecosystem restorations are implemented in many parks, attempting to bring back damaged ecosystems to their original healthy state and making them sustainable. For example, Grasslands National Park brought back Bison bison for a prairie restoration. The bison grazing patterns help to maintain a variety of prairie biodiversity. In Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site, removing Norway rats which were accidentally introduced to the area, is conducted because they eat eggs, as well as juvenile and adult seabirds, and reduce the seabird population. Staff monitor for the return of rats by trapping and poison baits for recovering native seabird populations.

===Co-management===
Through parks policies and operation practices, Parks Canada has recognized the importance of working together with Indigenous peoples and other communities to manage parks&#x27; healthy ecosystem within and around national parks. 

In 1984, Ivvavik National Park was established as a result of an Aboriginal land claim agreement. Now, Ivvavik is managed co-operatively by Parks Canada and the Inuvialuit. Their mutual goals are to protect wild life, keep the ecosystem healthy and protect their cultural resources. In addition, they ensure the preservation of the Inuvialuit traditional way of living, including trapping, hunting and fishing.

Another example is Torngat Mountains National Park. In 2005, it was established as a result of the Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement. It preserves the aboriginal rights of the Labrador Inuit in Canada, which are land, resources and self-government rights. The federal government also signed the Labrador Inuit Park Impacts and Benefits Agreement with Inuit Association. As with the Ivvavik agreement, it ensures that Inuit can continue to use land and resources as their traditional activities and keep their exclusive relationship with the land and ecosystems. In addition, they agreed to manage the park cooperatively. A seven-member co-operative management board will be established to advise the federal minister of Environment for the matters of parks eco-management.

Parks Canada recognized Indigenous knowledge and their unique historical and cultural relationship with the lands, and thus, Parks Canada started to cooperate with Indigenous people for park management. Following 1985, began the creation of new national parks or national park reserves, including Aulavik, Nááts’ihch’oh, Tuktut Nogait and Thaidene Nëné, in the Northwest Territories. Qausuittuq, Quttinirpaaq, Sirmilik and Ukkusiksalik, in Nunvut. Akami-Uapishkᵁ-KakKasuak-Mealy Mountains and Torngat Mountains in Newfoundland and Labrador. Sable Island, Nova Scotia. The Bruce Peninsula and Rouge in Ontario. Wapusk, Manitoba, and Gwaii Haanas and Gulf Islands in British Columbia.

==Adding to the system==
===Proposed national parks and national park reserves===
A national park reserve is an area administered and protected like a national park but subject to Indigenous land claims. It is expected that park reserves will become national parks under the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; when the land claims are resolved. These include:
*Gwaii Haanas
*Gulf Islands
*Kluane (a portion of the park is designated as a Reserve)
*Mealy Mountains
*Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve
*Naats&#x27;ihch&#x27;oh
*Nahanni
*Pacific Rim
*Pituamkek
*Sable Island
*Thaidene Nëné

The following areas have been proposed as Parks or Reserves, studied, and discussed among stakeholders:
*Seal River Watershed in northern Manitoba (as a national park reserve).
*South Okanagan-Similkameen in the southern interior of British Columbia (as a national park reserve).

In addition, Parks Canada is considering other areas for future national parks:
*Expanding Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta into the Flathead Valley in British Columbia (as a national park reserve)

===NMCA and NMCA Reserves===
National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs) are a relatively new creation within the park system. There are currently three NMCAs:

*Fathom Five National Marine Park, Ontario
*Lake Superior NMCA, Ontario
*Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park, Quebec

Fathom Five National Marine Park and Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park were created prior to the NMCA concept, and subsequently classified as an NMCA without changing their legal names. NMCAs have a different mandate than their terrestrial counterparts. They are designed for sustainable use, although they usually also contain areas designed to protect ecological integrity.

Similar to national park reserves, National Marine Conservation Area Reserves are intended to become full NMCAs once claims are resolved. There is currently one NMCA Reserve: 
*Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve and Haida Heritage Site, adjacent to the national park reserve of the same name, in British Columbia

Two areas are under consideration as a National Marine Conservation Area or NMCA Reserve:
*Southern Strait of Georgia NMCA Reserve, in British Columbia, surrounding Gulf Islands National Park Reserve—a feasibility study is underway
*Tallurutiup Imanga NMCA, in Nunavut

===National landmarks===

In addition to national parks, a National Landmarks program was foreseen in the 1970s and 1980s, but has not been established beyond a single property. Landmarks were intended to protect specific natural features considered &quot;outstanding, exceptional, unique, or rare to this country. These natural features would typically be isolated entities and of scientific interest.&quot;

To date, only one Landmark has been established—Pingo National Landmark—in the Northwest Territories. Another was proposed at the same time (1984)—Nelson Head National Landmark—on the southern tip of Banks Island, also in the Northwest Territories. It was to include some , of coastline, and protect the sea cliffs at Nelson Head and Cape Lambton. Durham Heights were to be included, which reach an elevation of . The legislation providing for the Landmark required a formal request be made by the Minister of the Environment within 10 years (until 1994). None was ever made.

<doc id="585119" wikidata="Q5475662" url="?curid=585119" title="Four corners offense">
<text>The four corners offense, also known as the four corner stall or the four corners delay offense, is an offensive strategy for stalling in basketball, primarily used in college basketball and high school basketball before the shot clock was instituted. Four players stand in the corners of the offensive half-court while the fifth player dribbles the ball in the middle. The point guard usually stays in the middle, but the middle player may periodically switch, temporarily, with one of the corner players.

==Usage==
A four corners offense was most frequently used prior to the introduction of the shot clock in order to retain a lead by holding on to the ball until the clock ran out. The trailing team would be forced to spread their defense in hopes of getting a steal, which often allowed easy drives to the basket by the offense. The offense typically would seek to score, but only on extremely safe shots. The players in the corners might try to make backdoor cuts, or the point guard could drive the lane. Sometimes, one team would run the four corners offense throughout a game to reduce the number of possessions, in hopes of being able to defeat a superior opponent.

Even if the offense wanted to hold the ball until the end of the game, some strategy was necessary since the rules did not (and still do not) let a player hold the ball for more than five seconds while being closely guarded. So, some mechanism to facilitate safe passes was needed, which this offense provided. There were (and still are) other slowdown strategies, but the four corners was the most well known.

==History==

The offense was created by the early 1950s by John McLendon, head coach of the North Carolina Central Eagles, and popularized by longtime North Carolina Tar Heels head coach Dean Smith in the early 1960s. He used it to great effect under point guard Phil Ford; it was during his career that some writers referred to the offense as the &quot;Ford Corners.&quot;

Basketball&#x27;s &quot;5 seconds closely guarded&quot; rule was originally introduced partly to prevent stalling, and other rule changes were made to the college rules through the 1970s in hopes of eliminating stalling without using a shot clock as the National Basketball Association (NBA) had since its 1954–55 season. There was a perception that the NBA shot clock did not allow time to work the ball to get a good shot, and that it would reduce the opportunity for varied styles of play.

However, by the early 1980s, fans were fed up. In the nationally televised 1982 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game between the North Carolina Tar Heels and the Virginia Cavaliers, North Carolina held the ball for roughly the last seven minutes of the second half to nurse a small lead, eventually winning, 47–45. The next year, the ACC and other conferences introduced a shot clock experimentally, along with a three-point field goal to force defenses to spread out. In 1985, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) adopted a shot clock nationally and added the three-pointer a year later.

===Tributes===
This style of offense was so distinctive that a local restaurant-bar in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was named Four Corners in homage to Dean Smith, a local hero.

On February 21, 2015, the Tar Heels, coached by Smith protege Roy Williams, successfully ran the offense on the opening possession against Georgia Tech as a tribute to the recently deceased Smith.

<text>Dame Denise Rosemarie Lewis (born 27 August 1972) is a British sports administrator and former sports presenter and athletics athlete, who specialised in the heptathlon.

She won the gold medal in the heptathlon at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, was twice Commonwealth Games champion, was the 1998 European Champion, and won World Championships silver medals in 1997 and 1999. She was the first European to win the Olympic heptathlon, though Europeans, including Briton Mary Peters, had won the Olympic pentathlon precursor event.

Her personal best score for the heptathlon is 6,831 points, set at the Décastar meeting in 2000. That is a former British record and ranks her third on the all-time British lists behind double World, double Commonwealth Games champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Olympic, three-time World and European champion Jessica Ennis-Hill. Along with these two and pentathletes Mary Rand and Dame Mary Peters, Lewis is recognised as one of Britain&#x27;s greatest female multi-eventers, and the first in the line of British global champions in heptathlon.

Since retiring from athletics, she has undertaken work on television and other media work, and was a regular athletics pundit for BBC Television, including during the Olympic Games in London 2012, Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. It was announced that she had stepped down from her role at the BBC on the conclusion of the athletics programme at the 2024 Games.

In addition to her media work, Lewis is president of Commonwealth Games England which is the official Commonwealth Games Association for England at the Commonwealth Games and, since 2023, president of UK Athletics, the governing body for the sport of Athletics in the United Kingdom.

==Early career==
In her early heptathlete career at senior level Lewis won gold at the 1994 Commonwealth Games, bronze at the 1996 Olympics, silver at the 1997 World Championships, gold at the 1998 Commonwealth Games and European Championships and silver at the 1999 World Championships.

== 2000 Olympics ==
The first day of the 2000 Summer Olympics heptathlon was 23 September. In the first event, Lewis recorded 13.23 seconds for the 100 metres hurdles, to be in second place behind the world champion, Eunice Barber, who had finished in 12.97 seconds. Ghada Shouaa, the 1996 Olympic champion, pulled out after only 20 metres of her heat.

After a poor performance in the high jump, clearing only 1.75m, some way off her personal best, Lewis was in eighth place, 152 points behind Barber who had increased her lead. In the third event, the shot put, Lewis recorded a distance of 15.55m, placing her second, 30 points behind Natallia Sazanovich and 45 points ahead of former world champion Sabine Braun. Barber&#x27;s distance of 11.27m put her in eighth place.

In the final event of the day, the 200 metres, Lewis recorded a time of 24.34 sec. Braun&#x27;s time placed her in sixth position. A strong run by Natalya Roshchupkina moved her from sixth position to second, pushing Lewis into third place.

At the end of the first day, the points scored were:
# Natallia Sazanovich, BLR: 3,903
# Natalya Roshchupkina, RUS: 3,872
# Denise Lewis, GBR: 3,852
# Urszula Włodarczyk, POL: 3,805
# Yelena Prokhorova, RUS: 3,771
# Sabine Braun, GER: 3,770
# Eunice Barber, FRA: 3,707
# Karin Specht-Ertl, GER: 3,697

The first event on the second day was the long jump. Lewis&#x27;s best jump was 6.48m, marginally behind Yelena Prokhorova and Sazanovich. Eunice Barber, struggling with injury, withdrew after this event. In event six, the javelin, Lewis achieved a throw of 50.19m. With her closest rivals some way further back she moved into first place, with Sazanovich 63 points behind in second place and Prokhorova in third a further 83 points behind.

In the final event, the 800 metres, Lewis ran with the lower part of her left leg bandaged due to a calf and Achilles tendon injury, aiming to stay close enough to the race leaders to maintain her points advantage. Prokhorova won the race convincingly and when Lewis crossed the line behind Sazanovich it was not clear, at first, if Lewis&#x27;s time of 2:16.83 was enough to retain first place. After the individual points had been calculated, it was announced that Lewis had won with a total of 6,584 points. Prokhorova was second with 6,531 (53 points behind Lewis), and Sazanovich was third with 6,527 (4 points behind Prokhorova).

== 2004 Olympics ==
At the 2004 Olympics, Lewis was suffering from a number of injuries and withdrew from the competition after the long jump. Teammate and training partner Kelly Sotherton took bronze.

<text>The Kawasaki Ki-61 &quot;Hien&quot; (飛燕, &quot;flying swallow&quot;) is a Japanese World War II fighter aircraft. Used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service, it was designated the &quot;Army Type 3 Fighter&quot; (三式戦闘機). Allied intelligence initially believed Ki-61s were Messerschmitt Bf 109s and later an Italian Macchi C.202, which led to the Allied reporting name of &quot;Tony&quot;, assigned by the United States War Department. The design originated as a variant of the Kawasaki Ki-60, which never entered production. The Ki-61 became the only mass-produced Japanese fighter of the war to use a liquid-cooled inverted V engine. Over 3,000 Ki-61s were produced. Initial prototypes saw action over Yokohama during the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942, and continued to fly combat missions throughout the war.

==Design and development==
The Ki-61 was designed by Takeo Doi and his deputy Shin Owada in response to a late 1939 tender by the &quot;Koku Hombu&quot; for two fighters, each to be built around the Daimler-Benz DB 601Aa. Production aircraft would use a Kawasaki licensed DB 601, known as the &quot;Ha-40&quot;, which was to be manufactured at its Akashi plant. The Ki-60 was to be a heavily armed specialised interceptor, with a high wing loading; the Ki-61 was to be a more lightly loaded and armed general-purpose fighter, intended to be used mainly in an offensive, air superiority role at low to medium altitudes.

Both single-seat, single-engine fighters used the same basic construction: all-metal alloys with semi-monocoque fuselages and three-spar wings, with alloy-framed, fabric-covered ailerons, elevators and rudders. Priority was given to the Ki-60, which first flew in April 1941, while design work on the Ki-61 did not begin until December 1940. Although the Ki-61 was broadly similar to the Ki-60, it featured several refinements exploiting lessons learned from the disappointing flight characteristics of the earlier design.

The all-metal, semi-monocoque fuselage was basically oval in cross-section, changing to a tapered, semi-triangular oval behind the cockpit canopy, with a maximum depth of 1.35 m (4 ft 5 in). An unusual feature of the Ki-61 was that the engine bearers were constructed as an integral part of the forward fuselage, with the cowling side panels being fixed. For servicing or replacement, only the top and bottom cowling panels could be removed. A tapered, rectangular supercharger air intake was located on the port-side cowling. Behind the engine bulkhead were the ammunition boxes feeding a pair of synchronized 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine guns which were set in a &quot;staggered&quot; configuration (the port weapon slightly further forward than that to starboard) in a bay just above and behind the engine. The breeches partly projected into the cockpit, above the instrument panel. The Ho-103 was a light weapon for its caliber (around 23 kg/51 lb) and fired a light shell, but this was compensated for by its rapid rate of fire. The ammunition capacity was limited, having only around 250 rounds for each weapon. A self-sealing fuel tank with a capacity of 165 L (44 US gal) was located behind the pilot&#x27;s seat. The windshield was armored and there was a 13 mm (.51 in) armor plate behind the pilot. The radiator and oil cooler for the liquid-cooled engine were in a ventral location below the fuselage and wing trailing edge, covered by a rectangular section fairing with a large, adjustable exit flap.

The evenly-tapered wings had an aspect ratio of 7.2 with a gross area of 20 m2 (215.28 ft2) and featured three spars; a Warren truss main spar and two auxiliary spars. The rear spar carried the split flaps and long, narrow-chord ailerons, while the front spar incorporated the undercarriage pivot points. The undercarriage track was relatively wide at 4 m (13 ft 1.5 in). Each wing had a partially self-sealing 190 L (50 US gal) fuel tank behind the main spar, just outboard of the fuselage. A single weapon (initially a 7.7 mm/0.303 in Type 89 machine gun) was able to be carried in a weapons bay located behind the main spar.

The first prototype of the &quot;San-shiki-Sentohki ichi gata&quot; (&quot;Type 3 Fighter, Model 1&quot;, the official IJAAF designation) first flew in December 1941 at Kagamigahara Airfield. Although test pilots were enthusiastic about its self-sealing fuel tanks, upgraded armament, and good dive performance, the wing loading of 146.3 kg/m2 (30 lb/ft2) at an all-up weight of 2,950 kg (6,500 lb) was viewed with scepticism by many of the senior officers of the &quot;Koku Hombu&quot;, who still believed in the light, highly manoeuvrable, lightly armed fighter epitomised by the then new Nakajima Ki-43-I-&quot;Hei&quot; which had a wing loading of 92.6 kg/m2 (19 lb/ft2) (and even that was considered borderline compared to the earlier Ki-27).

To address these concerns, Kawasaki staged a fly-off between two Ki-61 prototypes and the Nakajima Ki-43-I, a pre-production Nakajima Ki-44-I, a defector-flown Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3, a Messerschmitt Bf 109E-7, and a captured Curtiss P-40E Warhawk. The Ki-61 proved the fastest of all the aircraft and was inferior only to the Ki-43 in manoeuvrability.

The Ki-61 was the last of the fighters powered by the DB-601 or its foreign derivatives, and it was soon overshadowed by fighters with more powerful engines. By the time it first flew in December 1941, one year after the Macchi C.202&#x27;s first flight and three years after the first Bf 109E, the engine was already underpowered compared to the new 1,120 kW (1,500 hp) inline or 1,491 kW (2,000 hp) radial engines being developed (and already nearing the mass-production stage) to power the next generation of combat aircraft such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Moreover, the inline Ha-40 engine proved to be an unreliable powerplant, exacerbated in the South Pacific campaign, where high temperatures caused problems with the fuel pumps.

The DB-601 engine required precise and sophisticated manufacturing; the Ha-40 was lighter by roughly 30 kg (70 lb) and required even higher manufacturing standards. Reaching these standards proved difficult for Japanese manufacturers, an issue further complicated by the variable quality of materials, fuel, and the lubricants needed to run a sensitive, high-performance engine. The Japanese equivalent of the more powerful DB-605 engine was the Kawasaki Ha-140, which was fitted onto the Type 3 to produce the Ki-61-II high-altitude interceptor.

Compared to the Ki-61-I, the Ki-61-II had 10% greater wing area, used more armour and was powered by the Kawasaki Ha-140 engine generating 1,120 kW (1,500 hp). After overcoming initial fuselage and wing stability problems, the new interceptor reverted to the original wing and was put into service as the Ki-61-II-KAI. However, the Ha-140 engine had severe reliability problems that were never fully resolved, and around half of the first batch of engines delivered were returned to the factory to be re-built. A US bombing raid on 19 January 1945 destroyed the engine factory in Akashi, Hyōgo, and 275 Ki-61-II-KAI airframes without engines were converted to use the Mitsubishi Ha-112-II radial engine, resulting in the Ki-100. While the Ha-112 solved the problems encountered with the Ha-140, the new engine still had a major weakness: a lack of power at altitude, which diminished its ability to intercept high-flying B-29 Superfortresses relative to the Ki-61-II.

During testing, the &quot;Hien&quot; proved capable, but several shortcomings were subsequently revealed in operational service, namely the armor protection that was insufficient against larger guns and a sub-standard engine that eventually led to a new engine being considered.

==Operational history==
The Ki-61 looked so different from the usual radial-engined Japanese fighters that the Allies at first believed it to be of German or Italian origin, possibly a license-built Messerschmitt Bf 109. The first Ki-61 seen by Allied aircrew had been misidentified as a Bf 109 by USAAF Capt. C. Ross Greening during the Doolittle Raid. In early reports, when it was thought to have been a German fighter, the Ki-61 had been code-named &quot;Mike&quot;. The final, and better known code name adopted was &quot;Tony&quot;, because the Ki-61 looked like an Italian aircraft.

The new Ki-61 &quot;Hien&quot; fighters entered service with a special training unit, the 23rd &quot;Chutai&quot;, and entered combat for the first time in early 1943, during the New Guinea campaign. The first &quot;Sentai&quot; (Air Group/Wing) fully equipped with the &quot;Hien&quot; was the 68th in Wewak, New Guinea, followed by the 78th &quot;Sentai&quot; stationed at Rabaul. Both units were sent into a difficult theatre where jungles and adverse weather conditions, coupled with a lack of spares, quickly undermined the efficiency of both men and machines. Because the Ki-61 was so new, and had been rushed into service, it inevitably suffered from teething problems. Almost all of the modern Japanese aircraft engines, especially the Ki-61&#x27;s liquid-cooled engines, suffered a disastrous series of failures and ongoing problems, which resulted in the obsolescent Ki-43 still forming the bulk of the JAAF&#x27;s fighter capability.

Initially, this campaign went successfully for the Japanese Army Air Force (JAAF), but when the Allies re-organized and enhanced the combat capabilities of their air forces, they gained the upper hand against the JAAF. High non-combat losses were also experienced by the Japanese during this campaign. For example, while in transit between Truk and Rabaul, the 78th lost 18 of its 30 Ki-61s. The finicky Ha-40 engine could not be overhauled in the theatre, instead they had to be shipped to the nearest service depot in Halmahera, in eastern Indonesia.

Even with these problems, there was some concern in Allied aviation circles regarding the &quot;Hien.&quot; The new Japanese fighter caused some pain and consternation among Allied pilots, particularly when they found out the hard way that they could no longer go into a dive and escape as they had from lighter Japanese fighters. General George Kenney, the Allied air forces commander in the Southwest Pacific, found his Curtiss P-40s completely outclassed, and begged for more Lockheed P-38 Lightnings to counter the threat of the new enemy fighter.

However, the increasing numerical strength of Allied bomber units, along with inadequate anti-aircraft systems, imposed crippling losses on Japanese units. Approximately 174 out of 200 Japanese aircraft based in the Wewak area were lost during the attacks of August 17–21 1943. By the end of the campaign, nearly 2,000 Japanese aircraft had been lost in air attacks from up to 200 Allied aircraft at a time, around half of which were Consolidated B-24 Liberators and North American B-25 Mitchells armed with fragmentation bombs. After the Japanese retreat, over 340 aircraft wrecks were later found at Hollandia.
The Ki-61 was also utilised in Southeast Asia, Okinawa, China and as an interceptor during US bombing raids over the Japanese home islands, including against Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. The Ki-61 was notable for many reasons: initially identified as of either German or Italian origin, these aircraft were capable of matching Allied aircraft such as the P-40 in speed, and as evaluation had already shown, were superior in almost every respect. However, the armament of the early &quot;Hien&quot; was lighter, but still sufficient for most purposes. Some authors claim that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning was measurably superior. The Ki-61 carried a great deal of fuel, but due to having self-sealing fuel tanks it was not considered readily flammable, as many other Japanese aircraft were.

Owing to the additional weight, the Ki-61&#x27;s performance and agility suffered when its armament was increased, but it still remained capable with a 580 km/h (313 kn) maximum speed. The cannon armament was needed to counter the Allied bombers, which proved to be difficult to shoot down with only 12.7 mm (.50 in) machine guns. The empty and maximum weights for the Ki-61 prototype (2 × 12.7 mm/0.50 in + 2 × 7.7 mm/0.303 in) were 2,238 kg (4,934 lb) and 2,950 kg (6,504 lb), respectively; for the Ki-61-I basic (4 × 12.7 mm/.50 in) 3,130 kg (6,900 lb); and for the Ki-61-KAI (2 × 12.7 mm/0.50 in + 2 × 20 mm), 2,630 kg (5,798 lb) and 3,470 kg (6,750 lb).

A number of Ki-61s were also used in &quot;Tokkotai&quot; (&quot;kamikaze&quot;) missions launched toward the end of the war. The Ki-61 was delivered to 15th &quot;Sentai&quot; (group/wing), as well as some individual &quot;Chutaicho&quot; (Squadron Leaders) in other &quot;Sentai&quot;, and even to operational training units in the JAAF. The aircraft was largely trouble-free in service except for the liquid-cooled engine which tended to overheat when idling on the ground and suffered from oil circulation and bearing problems.

===Ki-61 Special Attack Unit===
The tactic of using aircraft to ram American Boeing B-29 Superfortresses was first recorded in late August 1944, when B-29s from Chinese airfields attempted to bomb the steel factories at Yawata. Sergeant Shigeo Nobe of the 4th &quot;Sentai&quot; intentionally flew his Kawasaki Ki-45 into a B-29; debris from the explosion severely damaged another B-29, which also went down. Other attacks of this nature followed, as a result of which individual pilots determined it was a practicable way of destroying B-29s.

On 7 November 1944, the officer commanding the 10th &quot;Hiko Shidan&quot; (Air division) made ramming attacks a matter of policy by forming ramming attack flights specifically to oppose the B-29s at high altitude. The aircraft were stripped of their fuselage armament and protective systems in order to attain the required altitudes. Although the term &quot;&quot;kamikaze&quot; is often used to refer to the pilots undertaking these attacks, the word was not used by the Japanese military.

The units assigned to the 10th &quot;Hiko Shidan&quot; included the 244th &quot;Hiko Sentai&quot; (Fighter group), then commanded by Captain Takashi Fujita, who organised a ramming flight called &quot;Hagakure-Tai&quot;&quot; (&quot;Special Attack Unit&quot;), which was composed out of volunteers from the three &quot;Chutai&quot; (squadrons) of the 244th: the 1st &quot;Chutai&quot; &quot;&quot;Soyokaze&quot;, 2nd &quot;Chutai&quot; &quot;Toppu&quot;, and the 3rd &quot;Chutai&quot; known as &quot;Mikazuki&quot;.

First Lieutenant Toru Shinomiya was selected to lead the &quot;Hagakure-Tai&quot;. On 3 December 1944, Shinomiya – along with Sergeant Masao Itagaki and Sergeant Matsumi Nakano – intercepted a B-29 raid; Shinomaya rammed one B-29, but was able to land his damaged Ki-61, which had lost most of the port outer wing, back at base. After attacking another B-29 Itagaki had to parachute from his damaged fighter, while Nakano rammed and damaged &quot;Long Distance&quot; of the 498th BG and crash-landed his stripped-down Ki-61 in a field. Shinomaya&#x27;s damaged Ki-61 was later displayed inside Tokyo&#x27;s &quot;Matsuya&quot; department store while Nakano&#x27;s Ki-61 was displayed outside, alongside of a life-size cut-away drawing of the forward fuselage of a B-29. These three pilots were the first recipients of the &quot;Bukosho&quot;, Japan&#x27;s equivalent to the Victoria Cross or Medal of Honor, which had been inaugurated on 7 December 1944 as an Imperial Edict by Emperor Hirohito (there are 89 known recipients, most of whom fought and scored against B-29s). The existence of the ramming unit had been kept confidential until then, but it was officially disclosed in the combat results announcement and officially named &quot;Shinten Seiku Tai&quot;&quot; (&quot;Body Attack Detachment&quot;) by the Defense GHQ. On 27 January 1945, Itakagi survived another ramming attack on a B-29, again parachuting to safety, and received a second &quot;Bukosho&quot;; he survived the war as only one of two known double-&quot;Bukosho&quot; recipients. Sergeant Shigeru Kuroishikawa was another distinguished member of the unit.
Despite their successful attacks, these pilots gained no reprieve and were obliged to continue these deadly and dangerous ramming tactics until they were killed or wounded so badly that they could no longer fly. They were regarded as doomed men and were celebrated among the ranks of those who were going to certain death as &quot;Tokkotai&quot; (&quot;kamikaze&quot;) pilots.

Some other Ki-61 pilots also achieved renown, among them Major Teruhiko Kobayashi of the 244th Sentai, who was credited by some with a dozen victories mostly due to conventional attacks against B-29s.

==Variants==
Note: &quot;Ko, Otsu, Hei&quot; and &quot;Tei&quot; are the Japanese equivalents to a, b, c, d. &quot;Kai&quot; (&#x27;modified&#x27; or &#x27;improved&#x27;) was also used for some models of the Ki-61.
;Ki-61-Hien
* Ki-61 Prototypes: 12 built

* Ki-61-II-KAIb: Armed with 4 x 20 mm cannon.
* Ki-61-III Prototype: This version had a cut-down rear fuselage and a canopy design which was later used by the Ki-100-I-Otsu

===Production===
Not included:

* Pre-production started with the first prototype completed in July 1941, and with further eleven builds in early 1942.

Note:

* Out of 374 Ki-61-II builds, 275 were completed as Ki-100 Ia.

Not included:

* Pre-production started with eight prototypes completed during Aug. 1943 to Jan. 1944.

==Operators==
* Imperial Japanese Army Air Service
Post War
*Chinese Nationalist Air Force - Operated some captured aircraft
*People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force - also operated some captured aircraft
*In 1945, Indonesian Air Force –then Indonesian People&#x27;s Security Force (IPSF) (Indonesian pro-independence guerrillas)– captured six such aircraft at numerous Japanese air bases, including Bugis Air Base in Malang (repatriated 18 September 1945). At least one was restored. Most aircraft were destroyed in military conflicts between the Netherlands and the newly proclaimed-Republic of Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution of 1945–1949.

===Ki-61 units===
The &quot;Hiko Sentai&quot;, usually referred to as &quot;Sentai&quot;, was the basic operational unit of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, composed of three or more &quot;Chutai&quot; (companies or squadrons). A &quot;Sentai&quot; had 27 to 49 aircraft, with each &quot;Chutai&quot; having 16 aircraft and pilots plus a maintenance and repair unit. Several &quot;sentai&quot; had other units under their operational control, most notably the &quot;Hagakure-Tai&quot; (&quot;Special Attack Units&quot;) of the 244th &quot;Sentai&quot;. By 1944, with the depredations of Allied attacks on supply lines and airfields, as well as the loss of pilots and aircraft through combat attrition and accidents, few &quot;sentai&quot; were able to operate at full strength.

<doc id="585138" wikidata="Q298355" url="?curid=585138" title="Pierre Bérégovoy">
<text>Pierre Eugène Bérégovoy (; 23 December 1925 – 1 May 1993) was a French politician who served as Prime Minister of France under President François Mitterrand from 2 April 1992 to 29 March 1993. He was a member of the Socialist Party and Member of Parliament for Nièvre&#x27;s 1st constituency.

==Early career==
Pierre Bérégovoy was born in Déville-lès-Rouen to a French mother and a Ukrainian father (original family name &quot;Береговий&quot; in Ukrainian or &quot;Береговой&quot; in Russian) who had left the Russian Empire after the Russian Civil War.

He started his professional life at the age of 16 as a qualified metal worker. He got involved in politics following his activities in the French Resistance – while working at SNCF during World War II. A member of the socialist SFIO and of the trade unions confederation Workers Force, he joined the staff of the Minister of Public Works and Transport, Christian Pineau, as adviser for relations with the trade unions in 1949. One year later, he became a technical agent at &quot;Gaz de France&quot;.

In 1959, he left the SFIO and participated in the foundation of the dissident Unified Socialist Party (PSU). He became an adviser of Pierre Mendès-France. In 1967, with Alain Savary, he created the pro-Mendès-France Union of Clubs for the Renewal of the Left. This group joined the renewed Socialist Party (PS) in 1969. He joined the executive group of the party behind François Mitterrand, and participated notably in the negotiations of the &quot;Common Program&quot; of the Union of the Left.

In 1981, following Mitterrand&#x27;s election as President of France, he was chosen as Secretary General of the Presidency. One year later, he joined the cabinet as Minister of Social affairs. He was among the Socialist politicians who advised President Mitterrand to leave the European Monetary System in order to continue Socialist economic policy. But in March 1983, Mitterrand listened to his Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy and ratified the change of economic policy.

Bérégovoy became Minister of the Economy and Finance, from 1984 to the 1986 Socialist electoral defeat.

Elected mayor of Nevers in 1983, and deputy of Nièvre &quot;département&quot; in 1986, in the electoral land of Mitterrand, he was manager of the latter&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign. After his re-election, at the time of each cabinet reshuffle, his name was mentioned as a possible prime minister. In the end, he returned to the Ministry of the Economy and Finance. In this function, he symbolized the adaptation of French socialism to the market economy and struck up hearty relations with employer representatives.

After the 1992 regional elections, which were a disaster for the PS, he was finally appointed Prime Minister and formed a new minority government. He promised to fight unemployment, economic decline and corruption. During his inaugural speech in the French National Assembly, he claimed he knew the names of politicians from the right-wing opposition implicated in corruption scandals, causing a great hue and cry. Bérégovoy forced Bernard Tapie, his Minister of Urban Affairs, to resign in May 1992 after his indictment by the French justice. He thus created the misnamed &quot;Balladur jurisprudence&quot;. In social policy, a number of reforms were carried out. In November 1992 a law was passed that inserted a (arguably narrow) definition of sexual harassment into the labour code and empowered the labour inspectorate and workplace committees to enforce it. In May 1992, increased aid was provided to farmers, mainly comprising reductions in the agricultural land tax and increased grants for young farmers. In June 1992, the French parliament passed a bill which required mayors to encourage social mixing in public housing. A law of 12 July 1992 was aimed at enhancing both the status of child-minders and &quot;the quality of day care for children in a family environment,&quot; and a law of 29 July 1992 improved entitlement to medical assistance. The Sapin law of January 1993 sought to prevent corruption and encourage transparency &quot;in economic activities and public procedures,&quot; and a law of January 1993 established &quot;the principle of joint parental authority in the legitimate family, even if a divorce occurs.&quot; In addition, the coverage of housing benefits was extended in 1993.

After nearly a year as Prime Minister, Bérégovoy led the Socialist Party into the electoral collapse of the March 1993 parliamentary elections: the governing party, which previously held 260 seats (29 short from an overall majority), was reduced to only 53 seats, thus constituting the worst electoral defeat in the French left&#x27;s history and one of the worst ever suffered by a governing party in French history. He resigned as PM on 29 March 1993.

== Death ==

Bérégovoy killed himself with a gunshot on 1 May 1993. Friends said he had been depressed ever since he lost the March legislative election in which his Socialist Party won only 67 out of 577 parliamentary seats. Bérégovoy was also being investigated concerning a one-million-franc interest-free loan he received from businessman and close friend, Roger-Patrice Pelat. Pelat had died of a heart attack on 7 March 1989, shortly after being found guilty in the Péchiney-Triangle affair.

At Bérégovoy&#x27;s funeral, held at Nevers in an atmosphere of tension and shock, François Mitterrand stated that media pressure in connection with the Pelat scandal was responsible for Bérégovoy&#x27;s suicide. Targeting the press, he said Bérégovoy&#x27;s &quot;honour was thrown to the dogs&quot;, crediting him with &quot;the grandeur of someone who chooses his destiny.&quot;

<text>The chestnut-backed owlet (Glaucidium castanotum) (often misspelled &quot;Glaucidium castanonotum&quot;), is an owl which is endemic to Sri Lanka. This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as typical owls, Strigidae, which contains most of the smaller owl species. This species was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the jungle owlet.

==Description==
The chestnut-backed owlet is small and stocky, measuring in length. It resembles the jungle owlet in shape, size and appearance but the upperparts, scapulars and wing coverts are mainly chestnut brown, with darker barring. The underparts are white with blackish shaft-streaks. The facial disc is mainly brown and the eyes are yellow. There is a white neckband. Sexes are similar in appearance, with no sexual dimorphism.

==Distribution and habitat==
The chestnut-backed owlet is a common resident bird in the wet zone forests of Sri Lanka, and can be seen easily at sites such as Kitulgala and Sinharaja. Historical reports of its distribution by Legge include many parts of the southern half of Sri Lanka, especially the hills and the wet-zone low country extending to the outskirts of Colombo. In recent times, its range has shrunk greatly, and it is now found sparingly in the remaining forests of the wet zone and the adjoining hills at altitudes of up to above sea level.

==Behaviour==
This species is diurnal and is frequently seen in the day, especially in the evening. The flight is deeply undulating. It can often be located by the small birds that mob it while it is perched in a tree. It frequents tops of tall trees, usually on steep hill-sides and hence is often missed. It feeds mainly on insects, such as beetles, but also captures mice, small lizards, and small birds mostly when the young are being fed. The call is a slow &quot;kraw-kraw&quot; and carries for a long distance. It nests in a hole in a tree, laying two eggs.

==In culture==

In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;Pitathabala Vana-Bassa&quot; (පිටතඔල වන බස්සා in Sinhala).

<doc id="585143" wikidata="Q777407" url="?curid=585143" title="Closed-form expression">
<text>In mathematics, an expression or equation is in closed form if it is formed with constants, variables and a finite set of basic functions connected by arithmetic operations (, and integer powers) and function composition. Commonly, the allowed functions are &quot;n&quot;th root, exponential function, logarithm, and trigonometric functions. However, the set of basic functions depends on the context.

The &quot;closed-form problem&quot; arises when new ways are introduced for specifying mathematical objects, such as limits, series and integrals: given an object specified with such tools, a natural problem is to find, if possible, a &quot;closed-form expression&quot; of this object, that is, an expression of this object in terms of previous ways of specifying it.

== Example: roots of polynomials ==

The quadratic formula
:formula_1
is a &quot;closed form&quot; of the solutions to the general quadratic equation formula_2

More generally, in the context of polynomial equations, a closed form of a solution is a solution in radicals; that is, a closed-form expression for which the allowed functions are only th-roots and field operations formula_3 In fact, field theory allows showing that if a solution of a polynomial equation has a closed form involving exponentials, logarithms or trigonometric functions, then it has also a closed form that does not involve these functions.

There are expressions in radicals for all solutions of cubic equations (degree 3) and quartic equations (degree 4). The size of these expressions increases significantly with the degree, limiting their usefulness.

In higher degrees, the Abel–Ruffini theorem states that there are equations whose solutions cannot be expressed in radicals, and, thus, have no closed forms. A simple example is the equation formula_4 Galois theory provides an algorithmic method for deciding whether a particular polynomial equation can be solved in radicals.

== Symbolic integration ==

Symbolic integration consists essentially of the search of closed forms for antiderivatives of functions that are specified by closed-form expressions. In this context, the basic functions used for defining closed forms are commonly logarithms, exponential function and polynomial roots. Functions that have a closed form for these basic functions are called elementary functions and include trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, and inverse hyperbolic functions.

The fundamental problem of symbolic integration is thus, given an elementary function specified by a closed-form expression, to decide whether its antiderivative is an elementary function, and, if it is, to find a closed-form expression for this antiderivative.

For rational functions; that is, for fractions of two polynomial functions; antiderivatives are not always rational fractions, but are always elementary functions that may involve logarithms and polynomial roots. This is usually proved with partial fraction decomposition. The need for logarithms and polynomial roots is illustrated by the formula 
:formula_5
which is valid if formula_6 and formula_7 are coprime polynomials such that formula_7 is square free and formula_9

== Alternative definitions ==

Changing the definition of &quot;well known&quot; to include additional functions can change the set of equations with closed-form solutions. Many cumulative distribution functions cannot be expressed in closed form, unless one considers special functions such as the error function or gamma function to be well known. It is possible to solve the quintic equation if general hypergeometric functions are included, although the solution is far too complicated algebraically to be useful. For many practical computer applications, it is entirely reasonable to assume that the gamma function and other special functions are well known since numerical implementations are widely available.

== Analytic expression ==
An analytic expression (also known as expression in analytic form or analytic formula) is a mathematical expression constructed using well-known operations that lend themselves readily to calculation. Similar to closed-form expressions, the set of well-known functions allowed can vary according to context but always includes the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), exponentiation to a real exponent (which includes extraction of the th root), logarithms, and trigonometric functions.

However, the class of expressions considered to be analytic expressions tends to be wider than that for closed-form expressions. In particular, special functions such as the Bessel functions and the gamma function are usually allowed, and often so are infinite series and continued fractions. On the other hand, limits in general, and integrals in particular, are typically excluded.

If an analytic expression involves only the algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation to a rational exponent) and rational constants then it is more specifically referred to as an algebraic expression.

== Comparison of different classes of expressions ==

Closed-form expressions are an important sub-class of analytic expressions, which contain a finite number of applications of well-known functions. Unlike the broader analytic expressions, the closed-form expressions do not include infinite series or continued fractions; neither includes integrals or limits. Indeed, by the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, any continuous function on the unit interval can be expressed as a limit of polynomials, so any class of functions containing the polynomials and closed under limits will necessarily include all continuous functions.

Similarly, an equation or system of equations is said to have a closed-form solution if, and only if, at least one solution can be expressed as a closed-form expression; and it is said to have an analytic solution if and only if at least one solution can be expressed as an analytic expression. There is a subtle distinction between a &quot;closed-form &quot;function&quot;&quot; and a &quot;closed-form &quot;number&quot;&quot; in the discussion of a &quot;closed-form solution&quot;, discussed in and below. A closed-form or analytic solution is sometimes referred to as an explicit solution.

== Dealing with non-closed-form expressions ==

=== Transformation into closed-form expressions ===

The expression:
formula_10
is not in closed form because the summation entails an infinite number of elementary operations. However, by summing a geometric series this expression can be expressed in the closed form:
formula_11

=== Differential Galois theory ===

The integral of a closed-form expression may or may not itself be expressible as a closed-form expression. This study is referred to as differential Galois theory, by analogy with algebraic Galois theory.

The basic theorem of differential Galois theory is due to Joseph Liouville in the 1830s and 1840s and hence referred to as Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

A standard example of an elementary function whose antiderivative does not have a closed-form expression is: formula_12 whose one antiderivative is (up to a multiplicative constant) the error function:
formula_13

=== Mathematical modelling and computer simulation ===

Equations or systems too complex for closed-form or analytic solutions can often be analysed by mathematical modelling and computer simulation (for an example in physics, see).

== Closed-form number ==

Three subfields of the complex numbers have been suggested as encoding the notion of a &quot;closed-form number&quot;; in increasing order of generality, these are the Liouvillian numbers (not to be confused with Liouville numbers in the sense of rational approximation), EL numbers and elementary numbers. The Liouvillian numbers, denoted , form the smallest &quot;algebraically closed&quot; subfield of closed under exponentiation and logarithm (formally, intersection of all such subfields)—that is, numbers which involve &quot;explicit&quot; exponentiation and logarithms, but allow explicit and &quot;implicit&quot; polynomials (roots of polynomials); this is defined in . was originally referred to as elementary numbers, but this term is now used more broadly to refer to numbers defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of algebraic operations, exponentials, and logarithms. A narrower definition proposed in , denoted , and referred to as EL numbers, is the smallest subfield of closed under exponentiation and logarithm—this need not be algebraically closed, and corresponds to &quot;explicit&quot; algebraic, exponential, and logarithmic operations. &quot;EL&quot; stands both for &quot;exponential–logarithmic&quot; and as an abbreviation for &quot;elementary&quot;.

Whether a number is a closed-form number is related to whether a number is transcendental. Formally, Liouvillian numbers and elementary numbers contain the algebraic numbers, and they include some but not all transcendental numbers. In contrast, EL numbers do not contain all algebraic numbers, but do include some transcendental numbers. Closed-form numbers can be studied via transcendental number theory, in which a major result is the Gelfond–Schneider theorem, and a major open question is Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture.

== Numerical computations ==

For purposes of numeric computations, being in closed form is not in general necessary, as many limits and integrals can be efficiently computed. Some equations have no closed form solution, such as those that represent the Three-body problem or the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Therefore, the future states of these systems must be computed numerically.

== Conversion from numerical forms ==

There is software that attempts to find closed-form expressions for numerical values, including RIES, in Maple and SymPy, Plouffe&#x27;s Inverter, and the Inverse Symbolic Calculator.

<text>Pierre Mauroy (; 5 July 1928 – 7 June 2013) was a French Socialist politician who was Prime Minister of France from 1981 to 1984 under President François Mitterrand. Mauroy also served as Mayor of Lille from 1973 to 2001. At the time of his death Mauroy was the emeritus mayor of the city of Lille. He died from complications of lung cancer on 7 June 2013 at the age of 84.

As prime minister, Mauroy&#x27;s government implemented a range of social reforms during its term. These included reducing the legal workweek, lowering the retirement age, increasing social welfare benefits, and extending entitlement to paid holidays. The government increased state industrial investment, provided credit to private industry, created new civil service jobs, and launched a housebuilding drive. It also reduced the burden of direct taxes on lower-income groups, increased the minimum wage and unemployment benefits, and extended health care coverage. The Mauroy government also introduced measures to promote voluntary retirement, early retirement, and improve socio-economic conditions in low-income neighborhoods. Harsh immigration statutes were reversed, new rights were introduced for helper spouses, and an anti-discriminatory Professional Equality Law was enacted. The government also passed decentralizing laws that transferred responsibilities for urban and economic planning to municipalities and regions. These policies significantly improved the living standards of the less well-off in French society, reducing poverty during Mauroy&#x27;s term in office

In the early 1980s, the Mauroy government introduced several ordinances and laws aimed at promoting gender equality, improving working conditions, and increasing access to education. These included limiting the duration of fixed-term contracts and assignments, opening up civil service jobs to women, abolishing tax laws that favored the head of the household, and providing special aid to farmers. The government also increased funding for education and created new teaching positions, particularly in technical education, and established Educational Priority Zones to address academic failure in depressed areas. Reforms were also introduced to make entry to the National School of Administration more accessible to a wider range of French society, including raising the age limit and reducing the advantage of upper-class applicants.

The Auroux Laws of 1982 improved the rights of trade unions and employees in France, including collective bargaining, representation, information, health and safety, and protection against unfair dismissal. The laws required compensation for overtime and increased paid time off for union activities. They also established mandatory collective bargaining and strengthened rules on health and safety. However, the comite d&#x27;entreprise remained a consultative body with limited influence on economic policy, and smaller firms were not required to provide economic information to their comite. The government also introduced measures to provide greater employment security for part-time and fixed-term workers, ensure equal benefits for women in civil service, and encourage the formation of immigrant associations. New policies removed language requirements for immigrants in employee institutions and allowed foreign workers to sit on industrial relations councils. A program to assist the repatriation of Algerian nationals was also replaced with a choice between vocational training, business assistance, and a repatriation grant.

The Mauroy Government in France passed several laws that reduced the powers of the prefect, increased the powers of local government and set up elected regional councils. They also abolished the security court and introduced measures to control police harassment. The government extended legal aid and passed legislation that combated discrimination against homosexuals. They reformed higher education, made the ENA more accessible and implemented a new healthcare policy that abolished private beds in hospitals. Additionally, the Mauroy Government promoted arts, culture and education by tripling state aid to the arts, quadrupling spending on public libraries and providing aid to provincial art museums and local archives. They also increased funding to provincial libraries, which resulted in more people obtaining access to major lending library resources. The provinces acquired new theatres, artistic centres, music halls, ballet companies, and popular culture facilities. Overall, the government significantly increased spending on culture from 0.45% of the national budget to 0.84% in 1984.

The social security reforms in France during the 1980s led to increased incomes for the poor, with a 25% increase in the minimum wage and improved allowances for the handicapped and child care. The right to claim sickness insurance was given back to unemployed workers and the costs of dental fees, hearing aids, and glasses were reimbursed. The minimum pension benefit for the elderly poor was raised by 62%. The SAFER was extended to assist young farmers, and various measures were introduced to boost farmers&#x27; incomes. Self-employed women were provided with a lump-sum maternity grant, and unemployment compensation was expanded to include workers who had resigned from their jobs. However, the reflationary economic strategy failed to improve the French economy in the long term, with increases in the level of inflation and trade and budget deficits. The number of people out of work topped 2 million, and austerity measures were carried out, including reducing unemployment benefits&#x27; duration and tightening eligibility, reducing guarantees to full pensions for early retirees, introducing hospital charges, and reducing medical reimbursements. The aim of the Socialists during the austerity period was to safeguard the position of beneficiaries and give special consideration to the poorest among them. While extra costs were imposed, efforts were made to restrain family costs while safeguarding priority groups. Failing to restrict the financing of private schools via the Savary Law, he resigned in 1984.

==Biography==

===Background===
Mauroy was born in Cartignies. A teacher, he led the Socialist Youth Movement and the Technical Teaching Union in the 1950s. He became a leading figure in the Socialist federation of Nord &quot;département&quot;, which was among the third biggest of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) party and climbed quickly in the party. In 1966, he became the second most powerful person of the party behind the secretary general, Guy Mollet. Nevertheless, when Mollet resigned as leader in 1969, Alain Savary was chosen to succeed him.

===Political career===
After the electoral disasters of 1968 and 1969, he was persuaded of the necessity to renew the party. In 1971, during the Epinay Congress, he supported François Mitterrand&#x27;s election to the party leadership and became the second most powerful person in the Socialist Party (PS). Two years later, he was elected as a deputy and Mayor of Lille.

Increasingly, Mauroy criticized the replacement of former SFIO members from important positions by allies of Mitterrand. In this, he formed an alliance with Michel Rocard, the main opponent of Mitterrand, during the 1979 Metz Congress. However, Mitterrand chose him as spokesperson during the 1981 presidential campaign; after Mitterrand&#x27;s election, he appointed Mauroy as Prime Minister.

===Prime minister===
Mauroy&#x27;s government was a radical reforming one, implementing a wide range of social reforms including the reduction of the legal workweek from 40 to 39 hours, the limiting of continuous shift working to an average of no more than 35 hours per week, the lowering of the retirement age to 60, and a rise in social welfare benefits. Entitlement to paid holidays was also extended from four to five weeks. During the Mauroy government&#x27;s first year in office, minimum pensions were increased by 38%, rent allowances by 50%, family allowances by 25% (50% for households with two children), and the minimum wage by 25%.

During the 1981–82 period, state industrial investment was substantially increased, 17 billion francs in ”soft loan&quot; credit was provided to private industry, 7 billion francs was set aside to help school leavers, 54,000 new civil service jobs were created, and a major housebuilding drive was launched. Efforts were made to shift the burden of direct taxes away from lower- income groups, while increases in the minimum wage gave the low paid a real increase in their living standards of about 15% in 1981–82. Unemployment benefits were also increased, together with the duration of time in which one could receive them. In addition, the maximum allowable workweek was reduced from 50 to 48 hours.

Upon taking office, the Mauroy Government embarked upon an ambitious redistributive programme. The minimum wage went up in real terms by 11% between May 1981 and September 1982, while the minimum old age pension was increased by 30%. 800,000 elderly people were exempted from paying TV licenses, while 1.5 million were also exempted from local taxes. Between May 1981 and January 1983, family benefits were significantly increased, with the purchasing power of the 2,700,000 families with two children raised by 40%. These policies significantly improved the living standards of the less well off in French society, with poverty reduced during Mauroy&#x27;s term in office. Family allowances were increased by 81% for families with two children and by 49% for families with three children, while old-age pensions were raised by 300 francs a month for a single person and 3,700 francs for a couple.

Altogether, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 45% in 1981 and by 7.6% in 1982. Health care coverage was also extended, with health insurance benefits made more widely available to part-time employees and the unemployed. Efforts were also made to promote voluntary retirement at sixty, with a pension ranging upwards from 80% of the SMIC to 50% of a middle-management salary. In 1982, two measures were introduced that extended eligibility for early retirement for workers aged 55 to 59: the &quot;contrats de préretraites progressive&quot;s and the &quot;contrats de solidarité-démission&quot;. These programmes were aimed at stimulating consumption and aggregate demand by providing firms with incentives to hire younger workers as replacements for early retirees. A year later, &quot;solidarity contracts&quot; were introduced which provided early retirement for older workers aged 55 or above on the condition that firms replace recipients with younger workers. Elderly people benefited greatly from the social and economic measures undertaken by the Mauroy Government, with the real income of pensioners rising by a quarter.

Harsh immigration statutes introduced during the presidency of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing were reversed, while an immigration law was passed (1981) to limit the grounds for expelling foreigners to facilitate family reunions and amnesty 130,000 illegal immigrants. A 1982 law introduced new rights for helper spouses, while the anti-discriminatory Professional Equality Law (1983), which defined equality between men and women &quot;in sweeping terms,&quot; required all businesses to furnish statistics on the situation of women in the workplace. This legislation marked a new departure in anti-discriminatory efforts and, reinforced by a series of measures taken by the Rocard government in 1989, brought an end to wage differentials hidden by different job descriptions. Decentralising laws were also passed which transferred responsibilities for urban planning to municipalities and economic planning to the regions. In addition, various measures were introduced to improve socio-economic conditions in low-income neighbourhoods. Aid for the improvement of older HLM housing was increased, with the allocation for 1982 being about 40% higher than in 1981. A guiding law about domestic transport enacted in 1982 stipulated “that the government needs to provide reasonably priced public transport for all citizens.” In 1983 a new minimum contributory pension was introduced “with increments according to the number of children,” a collaborative &#x27;interministerial&#x27; approach to employment and the social rehabilitation of &#x27;at risk&#x27; youth was adopted, and in 1983 the Banlieue 89 project was instigated for social and educational measures on estates in the educational priority areas. As a result of such policies, urban grants (as a proportion of local authority revenues) significantly increased during the first three years of the Mitterrand presidency, especially in municipalities controlled by the Left. In 1982, the &quot;Missions locales pour l’insertion professionnelle et sociale des jeunes&quot; were established, local advice centres that targeted young people (essentially in the 16-25 age group) experiencing major difficulties in finding work. A military reform law, passed in July 1983, enabled those who were opposed to the usage of arms on grounds of conscience to be accepted for civilian service.

An Ordinance of February 1982 limited the duration of fixed-term contracts to 6 to 12 months, and introduced an end of contract bonus of 5% total gross pay over the contract&#x27;s period. Another Ordinance passed that same month restricted the duration of assignments to 6 months, and increased the &#x27;precarious employment allowance&#x27; from 4% to 15% of gross pay per assignment. For public sector workers, a law was passed in 1982 to prevent gender segregation in recruitment and to ensure that the situation was monitored carefully. Under a law of May the 7th 1982 “civil service jobs previously closed to women had been opened to them.” Under the 1983 finance law, abolished “the notion of head of family that had been preserved in the tax law” was abolished and both spouses “must now sign a joint income tax return.”

An Act of July 1982 allowed the spouses of shopkeepers and artisans to receive social or work-related entitlements. An Act of August 1982 raised employers&#x27; participation in financing the public transportation expenses of employees. In April 1982 special aids were extended to farmers who had invested between 1 April 1981 and 31 March 1982.

Pursuant to its campaign pledges, the Mauroy Government established 14,760 new permanent teaching posts at the elementary and secondary levels in June 1981, and provided for 16,800 more in the 1982 budget and an additional 8,370 in the 1983 budget. A major increase in the modest salaries of elementary school teachers was announced. Technical education at the secondary level was declared to be a priority area, with special attention in the form of more scholarship money, additional teaching positions, and the commitment of 430 million francs per year for three years for the introduction of new technologies into the school programme. However, these actions (particularly the creation of only 400 new technical teachers&#x27; positions in 1981, when enrolment went up by 11,000) were seen as inadequate by the National Union of Technical Education-Autonomous Apprenticeship. In December 1981, a general science programme in the eleventh grade (premier) was created to replace the mathematics programme (the &quot;Bac C&quot;) which, after the fall from favour of Latin and Greek, had come to be known as a &quot;royal road into élitist schools and careers&quot;. The &quot;Premier S&quot; programme was an attempt to postpone definitive scholastic and social segregation, and also to reduce the importance of mathematical aptitude as the primary criterion for selection into élite schools. Greater funds were allocated to education, with the education budget was increased by 17.3% in 1982 and by 15% in 1983. In 1981–82, as a means of tackling cases of education failure, the Ministry of Education subsidized projects designed to help weaker students in 4,500 of the country&#x27;s 7,300 secondary schools. Although these subsidies were only of 30 million francs, the programme encouraged secondary schools to pay attention to the problem. They were heaviest in designated priority education and action zones.

In 1981, Educational Priority Zones were set up to provide additional resources to schools in depressed areas and to combat academic failure. The 1982 budget increased spending on education by 17%, while the 1983 budget provided tenure for 14,399 &quot;auxiliariat&quot;, teachers were only employed on a casual basis. A decree of June 1982 established a commission for public education staff training (or MAFPEN) in each &quot;académie,&quot; while CPR (or &quot;regional teacher training centre&quot;, which were established in 1952) training placements were extended to 8–9 hours a week. That same year, the Delegation for Training and Research in Education was set up to coordinate the activities of the MAFPENs.

The outgoing centre-right government was perceived to have harassed university assistants, the most junior faculty rank, by publicly questioning their qualifications, by increasing the teaching load of those who had not completed doctoral theses, and by limiting prospects for promotion and tenure. In May 1982, after several unions and associations announced a strike of assistants to call attention to their unmet grievances, the new education minister Alain Savary assured union leaders that all assistants who wished to continue a university career would be granted tenure. Promotion would be facilitated by the establishment of a thousand new maitre-assistant post per year for 4 years. In April 1982, following several demonstrations and strikes by the National Associations of Assistants (ANA), 2000 new tenured assistant positions were created.

Government decrees of September and October 1982 introduced various reforms aimed at making entry to the National School of Administration (or ENA) more accessible to a wider range of French society. The age limit was raised to enable less favoured candidates to catch up on career advancement, the element in the entrance examination for &quot;general culture&quot; (which had proven advantageous to upper-class applicants) was reduced, students from other grandes ecoles were prevented from making claims that they were already civil servants when they applied to the National School of Administration, and a rule of parity between students and lower civil servants among candidates for admission to the ENA was established. In addition, a law of January 1983 introduced a third route of access to the National School of Administration, reserved for those who had held important posts in mutual aid societies, voluntary associations, and trade unions for a period of at least eight years, and extended this opportunity to certain local elected officials.

The Auroux laws (1982) increased the rights of trade unions and employees in the workplace, covering collective bargaining, representation, information, health and safety, and unfair dismissal. The Auroux Laws included a requirement that half of all overtime worked in excess of 130 hours per year must be compensated by additional time off, while trade union delegates became entitled to an increase in paid time off for union activities and to increased protection against dismissal. In addition, an Auroux Law of November 1982 established an obligation to negotiate real wages and hours once a year at the level of the firm, and to negotiate real wages once a year and to revise job classifications once every five years at the national industry level. Mandatory collective bargaining at the firm level of industry was introduced, while the laws also strengthened the rules on health and safety in the workplace, bestowing more rights upon the Comites d’hygiene et securite (though not the right to stop production in case of extreme danger), while also granting working-class representatives release time, training for involvement in the comite d’entreprise and other representative bodies in the firm, recourse to expert consultants. Unions acquired rights to organise, to hold meetings in firms, and to call in outside speakers to address the workers. Worker representation on the comite d’rentreprise was increased and the comite was provided with additional powers, such as the right to obtain confidential economic information from the firm to use in advising it on policy. In spite of these positive changes, however, the comite d&#x27;entreprise remained a consultative body with little influence on economic policy, while only large firms were required to provide their comite d’enterprises with economic information. This meant that almost two-thirds of the workers were excluded from exercising this oversight function.

A government decree of March 1982 sought to provide greater employment security for the increasing number of workers on part-time and fixed-term contracts by restricting the circumstances in which employers could use such labour (this was largely to ensure that permanent employees were not displaced by cheaper and more easily dismissed part-time workers). The law set out to ensure that such workers receive the same benefits as full-time workers and trade unions were given statutory rights to institute legal proceedings against employers or temporary work agencies if the provisions of the new law were evaded. That same year, the government passed legislation to ensure the full, legal eligibility of women for all civil service posts and an active policy was adopted to encourage them to come forward for promotion. In 1981, legislation was passed which permitted the establishment of local private radio stations. In March 1982, a &quot;Special Statute&quot; was granted to Corsica, which set the territory apart legally from other regions and provided it with additional state subsidies and greater autonomy over cultural, social, economic, and educational policies. Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for migrants. A new drive began in 1981 to encourage local authorities to establish programmes including literacy programmes, housing schemes, and the setting up of young people&#x27;s and women&#x27;s groups, and in 1983 France ratified the Council of Europe&#x27;s Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. The Association Law of 1981 allowed foreigners for the first time to form associations in France under the same rules that governed citizens, and these new immigrant associations were thereafter eligible to receive public funding. New policies removed the French language requirements of immigrants to run for seats in employee institutions, and foreign workers became eligible for the first time to sit on important industrial relations councils known as the Conseils des Prud’hommes. In 1982, an existing programme to assist the repatriation of Algerian nationals was replaced by a system offering a choice between vocational training, assistance to set up a small business and a repatriation grant.

Decrees were made in January 1982 concerning official recognition of persons and bodies responsible for noise monitoring, the monitoring of carbon monoxide and benzene levels in the atmosphere at workplaces, and the inspection of electrical installations. A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations. A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery (listed in a decree of April 1981) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved. It also specified the information to be provided by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people. In June 1982, a new popular savings book paying index-linked interest was introduced, under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 (FF 20000 for households) savings in that scheme. Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings. A banking law of January 1984 entitled individuals lacking current accounts who had been refused by three banks to ask the Bank of France to designate a bank or the postal bank to provide them with free accounts.

An Act of January 1984 asserted a right for all parents to benefit from a parental leave of absence for childrearing, providing that they have one year&#x27;s seniority. This legislation also allowed parents (under the same conditions) to request part-time work and to shift freely between part-time work and parental leave. In 1982, the law governing the age of consent for homosexual activity was reduced from 18 to 15 years to match the age of consent for heterosexual activity. For those with disabilities, a 1982 law on urban transport reform stated that special measures must be taken to accommodate the special needs of people with limited mobility. A law passed on 9 July 1984 provided that a worker with at least two years&#x27; service must receive a redundancy payment based on gross earnings prior to termination of the work contract. The law further provided that workers aged 60 or above who voluntarily left the firm would receive a retirement severance grant.

Various measures were also undertaken to encourage research. Higher spending was allocated to research, while the directors of the various research councils were changed and a series of regional colloquia set up, which culminated in a national &quot;assises&quot; of researchers, where some 3,000 met in Paris to establish guidelines for future research policy. A law was passed that allowed researchers in universities and agencies to sign contracts with industry. CESTA, an agency for evaluating new fields of science and technology, was established, while more money was allocate to ANVAR, the national agency for promoting the application of basic research.

To safeguard workers from exposure to dangerous substances and agents, three Orders containing
the lists and the conditions for the labelling and packaging of dangerous substances (10 October 1983), of dangerous preparations solvents (11 October 1983) and of paints, varnishes, printing inks, glues and similar products (12 October 1983) gave effect to the corresponding EEC Directives under national legislation. A circular implementing these three Orders was issued in January 1984 and the substances and preparations not included in these orders were
covered by a circular on 4 July 1984. A circular of July 1982 on maximum concentrations was supplemented by two others, dated December 1983 and May 1984, with a view to the introduction of EEC Directive 80-1107 November 1980 on the protection of workers from exposure to chemical, physical and biological agents at work.

A law on worker&#x27;s democracy in public-sector companies was passed in July 1983 which sought to recreate a spirit of tripartism in a sector of the economy where existing statutory rights had failed to provide anything more than a consultative role for representatives. Previously, workers had the right to be represented on the boards of public sector companies with 50 or more staff and were entitled to at least 2 board seats, but under the new legislation, public sector companies (previously nationalized companies plus those companies that were nationalized in 1982 in which the state was the majority shareholder) would be obliged to have tripartite administrative or supervisory boards to which employee representatives would be elected by the workforce. A couple of autogestionary measures were also introduced. One measure involved workers&#x27; representation on the administrative councils of the nationalized industries, under which one-third of the members of these councils being drawn from the workforce. The other measure involved elections to the administrative commissions for social security, under which 15 and 25 members of these commissions were chosen through elections among those who were insured by the fund.

A law on vocational training in February 1984 established employment contracts for six months for further training on the job while taking courses. These included the contrats de qualification, the contrats d’adaptation, ranging from 6 to 24 months, and a 3 to 6-month programme known as the stages d’initiation a la vie professionnelle, which was designed to familiarise young people with factory and firm. A 1983 law on apprenticeships laid down the principle that apprenticeship is a method of giving young workers having completed schooling a general theoretical and practical training, for the purpose of acquiring professional qualifications leading to technology diplomas. The law laid down a number of general rules on apprenticeship. Training is organised on the basis of alternation, part in industry, and part in the
apprenticeship centre, while a contractual relationship must be created between the apprentice and the employer, by means of an apprenticeship contract. A higher education law of 1983 restored democratic representation on university councils and granted the universities greater autonomy and more power to conduct research and to make contacts with industry.

A decree of 23 March 1982 listed the offices responsible for testing lifting equipment other than lifts and building-site hoists, while a decree issued in May that same year 1982 extended its provisions to agriculture. Under a decree of 31 March 1982, the general health and safety regulations for dangerous machinery and appliances were extended to include portable hand-operated machinery and appliances. Exceptions for certain less dangerous appliances were laid down in a decree of June 1982. In regards to the agricultural sector, a decree of 8 March 1982 laid down the conditions attached to the approval of electrical installations in agricultural undertakings and specified which offices are authorized to test these installations. In 1983, leave was introduced for setting up businesses and sabbatical leave for wage-earners, and in June that year, a law was passed that completed the incorporation into French Law of a 1977 European Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees&#x27; rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses.

The Deferre Law reduced the powers of the prefect, set up elected regional councils, and increased the powers of local government. The security court was abolished, and measures were introduced to control police harassment. Legal aid was extended, legislation was introduced which effectively combated discrimination against homosexuals, and the traditional powers of the &quot;juge d’instruction&quot; in the preparation of criminal cases was reduced. The Quillot Law of 1982 provided renters with additional rights in housing matters, while an audiovisual law passed that same year brought an end to the state monopoly of audiovisual broadcasting and established a High Authority to guarantee the independence of public television channels. Laws were passed in 1982 to reform higher education to make the academy more responsive to the needs of the state. High security wings in prisons were abolished, while social security reform increased workers&#x27; representation on the bodies that oversaw the management of the social security schemes. In order to make the elite political academy (the ENA) accessible to a wider section of the population, a special entry pathway was established for those who had held trade union or political office. A new health care policy was implemented, which included the abolition of private beds in hospitals, reform of medical training, modernisation of facilities, and the election of the heads of medical services by the entire staff, rather than just by doctors, as had previously been the case. The Mauroy Government also withdrew a ministerial circular issued by the previous government that limited initiatives by regional councils, while a grant was created for the purpose of subsidizing local cultural projects and activities.

The Mauroy Government did much to promote arts, culture, and education, as characterised by a tripling in real terms in state aid to the arts, a quadrupling of spending on public libraries, which led to the number of library loans growing by a third, and the removal of obstacles to cheaper book-retailing. Aid was provided to provincial art museums and local archives for working-class affairs established, while funding to provincial libraries was significantly increased, with the national library budget going up from 163 million to 677 million francs. As a result of this additional library expenditure, 17 departments which had previously lacked a &quot;bibliothèque centrale de pret in 1981 had acquired one by 1986. In addition, as a result of the Mauroy Government&#x27;s library programme, 10 million more people obtained access to major lending library resources. As Paris&#x27; share of the cultural budget fell from 60% to 45% between 1981 and 1985, the provinces acquired new theatres, artistic centres, music halls, ballet companies, and popular culture facilities. During its first year in office, the Mauroy government increased spending on culture from 0.45% of the national budget to 0.75%, a figure which rose to 0.84% in 1984.
The incomes of the poorest sections of society were increased exponentially as a result of social security reforms and a 25% increase in the minimum wage. Allowances for the handicapped were also increased, while the right to deduct the cost of child care for all children under the age of three was introduced (a right later extended to include all children under the age of five in some cases). Unemployed workers ineligible for jobless benefits were given back the right to claim sickness insurance that they had lost in 1979 while the reimbursal of the costs of dental fees, hearing aids, and glasses was improved. An 80-franc-per-month charge that had been imposed on certain long-term illnesses was abrogated, and certain individuals who had retired before 1973 had the base upon which their pensions were calculated adjusted upward. Between 1981 and 1983, the minimum vieillesse (the basic pension benefit for the elderly poor) was raised by 62%.

To assist young farmers, the role of the SAFER (Societe d&#x27;Amenagemcnt Foncier et d&#x27;Etablissement Rural) was extended in 1982 to give preferential aid to this group to enlarge their holdings. Various measures were also introduced that helped to boost farmers&#x27; incomes. A partial price freeze instituted in June 1982 helped to limit the increase in production costs, while an income assistance programme (introduced in 1982 to compensate for a decline in farmers&#x27; incomes in 1981) contributed to a reduction in sectoral inequalities. In addition, an EEC price hike which the government negotiated in May 1982 represented an improvement over that of the previous year (11.2% compared with 10.3%). Consultative channels between farmers and government were also widened beyond the Federation Nationale des Syndicats d&#x27;Exploitants Agricoles (or FNSEA, the chief farming syndicat). In addition, the Mauroy Government had helped in the establishment of 12,000 farms with young farmers by mid-1983.

From 1982 onwards, all self-employed women in France were provided with a lump-sum maternity grant which may be supplemented by an income-replacement allowance. In 1983, the unemployment compensation programme was expanded to include workers who had resigned from their jobs. A law of July 1984 introduced a new benefit called the Insertion Allowance, providing short-term support for those in periods of transition into the labour market. Another law passed that same month introduced a Special Solidarity Allowance for long-term unemployed persons with no insurance entitlements remaining. In addition, an Act of October 1982 fully extended the right to join a union to people who were retired, and a law of February 1984 increased state support for the development and training activities of companies.

Although the Mauroy government&#x27;s social policies improved the living standards of the less well-off in French society, its reflationary economic strategy (based on encouraging domestic consumption) failed to improve the French economy in the long term, with increases in the level of inflation as well as in the trade and budget deficits. Although the government&#x27;s reflationary policies tended to stabilise unemployment, the number of people out of work topped 2 million, in spite of a pledge made by Mitterrand to keep it below this figure. A large budget deficit emerged, with social benefits and aid to industry alone going up by 50% in the 1982 budget. In addition, private investment failed to respond to the government&#x27;s initiatives, with a 12% decline in volume in 1981. This led Mauroy to advocate the abandonment of Socialist economic policies (which failed to reduce unemployment and inflation), a controversial &quot;U-turn&quot; which was ratified by President Mitterrand in March 1983, and a number of austerity measures were carried out. In 1982, housing allowances were decoupled from the cost-of-living adjustment index. In 1982 and 1983, eligibility for unemployment benefits was tightened. A complex set of changes introduced in 1983 surrounding early retirement effectively reduced guarantees to full pensions for early retirees. Daily charges for hospital beds were introduced, while a variety of medical reimbursements were reduced. In September 1982, the indexation of wages and salaries in the public sector was abolished.

During the austerity period, the aim of the Socialists was limited to that of safeguarding the position of beneficiaries as far as possible and of giving special consideration to the poorest amongst them. While further increases in benefits for the elderly, the handicapped, and in some family allowances later became possible, extra costs were also imposed. For instance, the duration of unemployment benefits was reduced, while a basic hospital charge (with exemptions) was introduced, and contributions from the early retired and unemployed towards health care were demanded although, once again, the worse off were exempt. Austerity measures also led to efforts to restrain family costs while at the same time trying to safeguard priority groups. In February 1982, a 25% increase was made in allowances for families containing two eligible children, but some benefits were abandoned and the starting and finishing dates for eligibility altered. Later, cash increases were less than the amounts necessary to maintain the real value of family benefits except for the poorest groups in French society. The limits on income assessed for social insurance contributions were raised and the income base upon which employers and the self-employed were assessed for contributions was changed. The cost of support for handicapped adults was transferred to the national government, although some taxation on tobacco and alcohol was also earmarked for this purpose. A 1% tax on personal incomes was imposed (although the poorest 33% of taxpayers was excluded), and a 1% &quot;solidarity&quot; contribution levied on civil servants towards the cost of unemployment insurance. In spite of austerity, however, the real value of social protection made modest increases. Within the total, the greatest benefits was reserved for the poorest whilst income was raised in ways which saw a modest shift from traditional financing methods towards general community financing.

Failing to restrict the financing of private schools via the Savary Law, he resigned in 1984.

===After Matignon===

In 1988 he became First Secretary of the PS against the will of Mitterrand, who supported Laurent Fabius. Until the end of his term, in 1992, he tried to appease the relations between the factions which composed the PS, notably during the very strained 1990 Rennes Congress. He allied with the &quot;rocardien&quot; group and Lionel Jospin&#x27;s supporters, who came from the &quot;mitterrandist&quot; group.

President of the Socialist International from 1992 to 1999, Senator since 1992, he left the Lille mayoralty in 2001. Considered a moral authority of the French Left, he supported the candidacy of Ségolène Royal during the 2007 primary election.

<doc id="585148" wikidata="Q12957" url="?curid=585148" title="Raymond Barre">
<text>Raymond Octave Joseph Barre (; 12 April 192425 August 2007) was a French politician and economist. He was a Vice President of the European Commission and Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs under three presidents (Rey, Malfatti and Mansholt). He later served as Prime Minister under Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing from 1976 until 1981. As a candidate for the presidency in 1988, he came in third and was eliminated in the first round. He was born in Saint-Denis, on the French island of Réunion, and then still a colony (it became an overseas department in 1946).

==Career==

===Professional life===
After his education, Raymond Barre was a professor of economics at the &quot;Institut d&#x27;Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po)&quot; as well as &quot;École Centrale Paris&quot;.

From 1959 to 1962, he was director of Jean-Marcel Jeanneney&#x27;s staff in the ministry of Industry and Trade. Then, in 1967, President Charles de Gaulle chose him as Vice-President of the European Commission for Economic &amp; Financial Affairs. He stayed in Brussels until January 1973, serving in the Rey, Malfatti and Mansholt Commissions. Having come back to France, he joined the cabinet as minister of External Trade in January 1976.

===Premiership===
Seven months later, while mostly unknown at that time, President Giscard d&#x27;Estaing appointed him Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance. He presented him to the French people as &quot;the best economist in France&quot; (). Under the Fifth Republic, he was the only person to hold these two offices at the same time. He left the ministry of Economy and Finance in 1978 but stayed as Prime minister until the defeat of Giscard d&#x27;Estaing at the 1981 presidential election.

At the head of the cabinet, he was faced with the conflict which divided the parliamentary majority between the &quot;Giscardians&quot; and the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) led by his predecessor Jacques Chirac. The right majority unexpectedly won the 1978 legislative election.

Barre was primarily confronted with an economic crisis. He advocated numerous complex, strict policies (&quot;Barre Plans&quot;). The first Barre plan emerged on 22 September 1976, with a priority to stop inflation. It included a 3-month price freeze; a reduction in the value-added tax; wage controls; salary controls; a reduction of the growth in the money supply; and increases in the income tax, automobile taxes, luxury taxes and bank rates. There were measures to restore the trade balance and support the growth of the economy and employment. Oil imports, whose price had shot up, were limited. There was special aid to exports, and an action fund was set up to aid industries. There was increased financial aid to farmers, who were suffering from a drought, and for social security. The package was not very popular but was pursued with vigour.

He did not use diplomatic language in the face of trade union opposition. Instead, he mocked &quot;the bearers of banners&quot; () and he exhorted &quot;instead of grousing, you should work hard&quot;.

===Post-premiership===
After he resigned as head of the cabinet, he was elected deputy of Rhône &quot;département&quot; under the label of the Union for French Democracy (UDF). However, he never formally joined the party. He held his parliamentary seat until 2002.

In the 1980s, he competed for the leadership of the right against Chirac. Believing that the &quot;cohabitation&quot; was incompatible with the &quot;Fifth Republic&quot;, he let Chirac take the lead of the cabinet after the 1986 legislative election. He ran as UDF candidate for president in the 1988 election, but some components of his party covertly supported the other right-wing candidate, the Neo-Gaullist Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. In this, in spite of positive polls at the beginning of the campaign, he came third behind the two protagonists of the &quot;cohabitation&quot;: the Socialist President François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac. For the second round, he called his voters to transfer to the RPR candidate, who was finally defeated.

After his presidential candidacy failed, he focused on his local tenures in Lyon. In 1995, the RPR Mayor of Lyon, Michel Noir, could not compete for another term due to a judicial indictment, so Barre was the conservative candidate for the mayoralty. He was elected, but he did not run for a second term in 2001. One year later, he finished his last parliamentary term in the French National Assembly and retired from politics.

Raymond Barre was probably the only French politician to have reached such high levels of responsibility without having ever been an official member or leader of any political party. He always kept some distance from what he considered to be the political &quot;microcosm&quot;.

Raymond Barre died on 25 August 2007 at age 83 at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris, where he was being treated for heart problems since his transfer from a hospital in Monaco on 11 April 2007.

==Allegations of antisemitism==

On several occasions, Raymond Barre made remarks that were interpreted as antisemitic, or at least supportive of antisemitism. In 1980, when he was prime minister, a bombing was attempted against the Union Libérale Israélite de France, a synagogue in the rue Copernic, Paris; however the bomb detonated in the street when the Jews attending shabbat were inside the synagogue, and not when they were out; but as a result some non-Jewish bystanders were killed. Raymond Barre then famously denounced:

:&quot;A hateful attack which wanted to strike at the Jews who were in that synagogue, and which struck innocent French people who were crossing the street.&quot;

In 2007, Barre argued on a radio show that &quot;the Jewish lobby&quot; had orchestrated criticism regarding his 1980 remarks. On this same show, Barre defended the collaborationist Maurice Papon at his trial, describing him as &quot;a scapegoat&quot;. Barre was criticized for these remarks.

<text>Jacques Chaban-Delmas (; 7 March 1915 – 10 November 2000) was a French Gaullist politician. He served as Prime Minister under Georges Pompidou from 1969 to 1972. He was the Mayor of Bordeaux from 1947 to 1995 and a deputy for the Gironde &quot;département&quot; between 1946 and 1997.

==Biography==
Jacques Chaban-Delmas was born Jacques Michel Pierre Delmas in Paris. He studied at the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux, before attending the École Libre des Sciences Politiques (&quot;Sciences Po&quot;). In the resistance underground, his final nom de guerre was &quot;Chaban&quot;; after World War II, he formally changed his name to &quot;Chaban-Delmas&quot;. As a general of brigade in the resistance, he took part in the Parisian insurrection of August 1944, with general de Gaulle. He was the youngest French general since François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers, during the First French Empire.
A member of the Radical Party, he finally joined the Gaullist Rally of the French People (RPF), which opposed the Fourth Republic&#x27;s governments. In 1947, he became mayor of Bordeaux, which was for 48 years his electoral fief. As a member of the National Assembly, he sat with the RPF.

In 1953, when the RPF group split (and Charles de Gaulle supposedly retired), Chaban-Delmas became head of the Union of Republicans for Social Action and president of the National Centre of Social Republicans party. He &quot;tied up&quot; with centre-left parties and joined Pierre Mendès-France&#x27;s cabinet one year later as Minister of Public Works. He took part in the centre-left coalition Republican Front, which won the 1956 legislative election. He was France&#x27;s Defence Minister in 1957–1958. His governmental participation during the Fourth Republic inspired the distrust of de Gaulle and some Gaullists.

Following Gen. de Gaulle&#x27;s return to power in 1958, Chaban-Delmas agreed to the advent of the French Fifth Republic and the new Constitution. He took part in the foundation of the Union for the New Republic (UNR) and was elected, against de Gaulle&#x27;s will, chairman of the National Assembly. He kept this function until the end of de Gaulle&#x27;s presidency in 1969. Unlike some Gaullists, for instance, Jacques Soustelle, he supported de Gaulle&#x27;s policy to end the Algerian War of Independence. During the 1959 UNR Congress, he was the first politician to evoke a &quot;reserved presidential domain,&quot; composed chiefly of defence and diplomacy. This interpretation of the Constitution of 1958 has survived.

In 1969, when Georges Pompidou acceded to the presidency, he chose Chaban-Delmas, who had concluded that the May 68 crisis was the consequence of a strained and conflicted society, as prime minister. Chaban-Delmas tried to promote what he called &quot;a new society&quot;, based on dialogue between the different social forces in French society. Amongst other reforms, government authority over the mass media was relaxed, while legislation was passed on social welfare coverage for the poor and elderly which consolidated France&#x27;s profile as a welfare state. In addition, regular increases were made to the minimum wage which prevented greater wage disparities. A new legal aid scheme was introduced, along with a number of new social welfare benefits.

As a result of his social policies, Chaban-Delmas was viewed as too &quot;progressive&quot; by the &quot;conservative&quot; wing of the Gaullist movement. He was suspected of wanting to &quot;tie up&quot; again with the centre-left. Indeed, his advisers who inspired the &quot;new society&quot; programme were considered as close to the centre-left (Simon Nora and Jacques Delors who would serve as Finance Minister under François Mitterrand). Besides, a latent conflict opposed Chaban-Delmas to President Pompidou and the presidential circle. They accused him of trying to weaken the presidency in favour of himself. The satirical paper &quot;Le Canard Enchaîné&quot; accused him of breaking the law through tax evasion and in 1972, Chaban-Delmas canvassed for a vote of confidence in the Assembly. He did obtain this, but the President still managed to force his resignation.

Two years later, following the death in office of President Pompidou, Chaban-Delmas ran for the presidency himself. He was supported by the &quot;lords of gaullism&quot;, but 43 personalities close to the late president, led by Jacques Chirac, published the &quot;Call of the 43&quot; in favour of the candidacy of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Chaban-Delmas was defeated on the first ballot of the 1974 presidential election, winning only 15.10% of the vote. Chirac became President Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s prime minister.

Chaban-Delmas stood in the Gaullist Party (RPR) and, in spite of Chirac&#x27;s leadership, returned to the chair of the National Assembly (1978–1981). Due to his friendship with President Mitterrand, his name was mentioned as a possible prime minister during the first &quot;cohabitation&quot; (1986–1988), but he instead became president of the National Assembly for the third time and Chirac again became premier.

Chaban-Delmas retired in 1997, towards the end of his thirteenth term of member of the National Assembly and two years after the end of his eighth term as Mayor of Bordeaux.

<text>Kingston is a town on the outskirts of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Nestled 12 km south of the city between and around several hills, Kingston is the seat of the Kingborough Council, and today serves as the gateway between Hobart and the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel region, which meets the Derwent River nearby. It is one of the fastest-growing regions in Tasmania. The Kingston-Huntingfield statistical area had an estimated population of 13,473 in June 2021.

Although the Kingston-Blackmans Bay region is statistically classed as a separate urban area to Hobart by the ABS, Kingston is also part of the Greater Hobart statistical area.

==History==
In 1804, the botanist Robert Brown visited the area. Browns River, that runs from Mount Wellington to Kingston Beach is named after him. The area was settled in 1808 by Thomas Lucas and his family, who were evacuated from Norfolk Island, and quickly the land became actively used by many pioneers who spread out to form the beginnings of Kingston&#x27;s localities today. In its early years, the area was also named after Brown, but when the population grew and a commercial district was established, Kingston was proclaimed a township in 1851.

The Kingston region comprises many suburban estates, including Blackmans Bay and Kingston Beach.

Kingston has close ties with the Dutch community, where after 1950 many post-war immigrants moved to an area they called &#x27;Little Groningen&#x27; (today Firthside). The Kingston Dutch community were primarily members of the Christian Reformed Churches of Australia, which they set up the local church of in 1952. Calvin Christian School was founded by the Dutch community in 1962.

Kingston was named by the Best Suburb in Australia for families by Aussie Home Loans in their annual study of 3800 Australian towns.

=== Climate ===
Kingston has a oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with very mild summers and cool winters. Average maxima vary from in February to in July while average minima fluctuate between in February and in June and July.
Mean average annual precipitation is moderate, spread between 131.5 precipitation days. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 20 January 1973 to on 25 June 1972.

==Economy==
Kingston hosts the national headquarters of the Australian Antarctic Division. It has two major shopping centres, Kingston Town Shopping Centre and Channel Court Shopping Centre. The newest shopping centre complex opened in 2008 its new name is, Kingston Plaza, which was built over the existing Coles supermarket site, comprising a new one and 15 other shops.

===Media===
Kingston is served by two free publications; the full-size newspaper &quot;Kingborough Chronicle&quot; and the weekly newsletter &quot;Kingston Classifieds&quot;.
Kingston is served by Pulse FM Kingborough and Huon and Huon FM 98.5.

==Education==
Kingston is served by a pair of public schools, Kingston High School (Grade 7–10) and Kingston Primary School (grade 1–6). It is also served by three private Christian schools; Calvin Christian School (kinder to year 12) and Southern Christian College (kinder to year 12), both of which are nondenominational, and the Kingston campus of St Aloysius Catholic College (grade kinder to year 4) at Kingston campus, grade 5 to year 10 at Huntingfield campus).

<doc id="585161" wikidata="Q1269116" url="?curid=585161" title="Collared scops owl">
<text>The collared scops owl (Otus lettia) is an owl which is a resident breeder in south Asia from northern Pakistan, northern India, Nepal, Bangladesh, the Himalayas east to southern China, and Taiwan. It is partially migratory, with some birds wintering in India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. This species was formerly considered to be included within what is now separated as the Indian scops owl (&quot;Otus bakkamoena&quot;).

This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as typical owls, Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping is the barn owls, Tytonidae.

The collared scops owl is a common breeding bird in forests and other well-wooded areas. It nests in tree hollows, laying 3-5 eggs.

The collared scops owl is a small (23–25 cm) owl, although it is the largest of the scops owls. Like other scops owls, it has small head tufts, or &quot;ears&quot;. The upperparts are grey or brown, depending on the subspecies, with faint buff spotting. The underparts are buff with fine darker streaking.

The facial disc is whitish or buff, and the eyes are orange or brown. There is a buff neckband. Sexes are similar. The flight is deeply undulating.

This species is nocturnal but it can often be located by the small birds that mob it while it is roosting in a tree. It feeds mainly on insects. The call is a quiet &quot;goog gook&quot;.

This species is chiefly found in northern India and is replaced by the very similar looking oriental scops owl &quot;Otus sunia&quot; (recently split) towards the south of its range. It is also very similar to the slightly smaller Indian scops owl. They are most easily separated in the field by their calls. It is sometimes considered as a sub-species of the Indian scops owl.

<text>The 800 metres, or 800 meters (US spelling), is a common track running event. It is the shortest commonly run middle-distance running event. The 800 metres is run over two laps of an outdoor (400-metre) track and has been an Olympic event since the first modern games in 1896. During the winter track season the event is usually run by completing four laps of an indoor 200-metre track.

The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half mile (880 yards), a traditional British racing distance. 800 m is 4.67 m less than a half mile.

The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed, so the 800m athlete has to combine training for both.

Runners in this event are occasionally fast enough to also compete in the 400 metres but more commonly have enough endurance to &#x27;double up&#x27; in the 1500m. Only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochvílová have won major international titles at 400m and 800m.

==Race tactics==
The 800m is also known for its tactical racing. Because it is the shortest middle-distance event that has all the runners converge into one lane (after the first bend), positioning on the cut-in and the position of the pack is critical to the outcome of the race. Gaining a front position early in the race is often advantageous as there are occasionally trips when running in a pack. Olympic champions Dave Wottle, Kelly Holmes and others have defied that logic by running a more evenly paced race, lagging behind the pack and accelerating past the slowing early leaders. Often the winner of elite 800m races is not the fastest runner, but the athlete best positioned near the end of the race: an athlete directly behind another runner, has to switch to an outer lane to overtake, so has to run further—and might be blocked by a third runner alongside.

800 metre participants usually run a positive split, where the first lap is faster, but a negative split is occasionally run as a tactic. The current world record (by David Rudisha) was run with a positive split in the 2012 Olympics. Rudisha ran the first lap in 49.28 seconds and the second in 51.63 seconds. Theoretically, an even split is the most efficient running mode, but it is difficult to pace correctly.

In 2024, the race tactics in the men&#x27;s 800m shifted toward a more evenly paced race. All fifteen sub-1:42 performances prior to 2024 featured a sub 50 second first lap. However, of the twelve sub-1:42 performances in 2024, six featured a first lap of 50 seconds or slower.

<text>Wildcats, sometimes rendered WildCats or WildC.A.T.s, is a superhero team created by the American comic book artist Jim Lee and writer Brandon Choi. The comic was published in various formats from 1992 through 2022. It also formed the basis for a television show, a line of toys, and a video game.

==Publication history==
The team first appeared in August 1992 in the first issue of their eponymous comic book WildC.A.T.s: Covert Action Teams, published by Image Comics. It was Image founding partner Jim Lee&#x27;s first work published by the newly launched company, and his first creator-owned project. The Wildcats were the starting point for Lee&#x27;s menagerie of interconnected superhero creations which became the foundation of the Wildstorm Universe. The Wildcats launched at the apex of a speculator-fueled comics sales boom and was wildly popular at its inception, with wholesale sales to comic book stores above one million copies for early issues. This first series ran for 50 issues, and in addition to Lee, featured work by comics creators such as Travis Charest, Chris Claremont, James Robinson and Alan Moore. This popularity saw the property expand into other media, with an animated adaptation of the comic debuting on CBS in 1994 and a toyline from Playmates Toys.

In 1998, ownership of the Wildcats concepts and characters were sold to DC Comics, a subsidiary of Time Warner, as part of DC&#x27;s acquisition of Lee&#x27;s company Wildstorm Productions. A new incarnation of the team was soon launched under the simplified title &quot;Wildcats&quot;, focusing on the former members of the now-disbanded team and emphasizing a grittier tone during its 28-issue run. The third series, &quot;Wildcats Version 3.0&quot;, revolved around the HALO Corporation, its CEO Jack Marlowe (an amalgamation of original team members Spartan and Void), Grifter, and a gallery of new characters subverting corporate politics to their cause of creating a better world. This incarnation lasted 24 issues and was followed by a nine-issue limited series titled &quot;Wildcats: Nemesis&quot;, which returned to a more superheroic style reminiscent of the first series. In late 2006, a fourth ongoing series was launched as a part of the Worldstorm publishing initiative. The series saw the return of Jim Lee as regular penciller for the first time since its first volume while Grant Morrison took over writing duties. Only one issue was ever published, with future issues placed on hold. In mid-2008, the fifth volume of Wildcats was launched, tying into the World&#x27;s End crossover event.

===&quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; volume 1 (1992)===
Launched as an original Image comic book title by popular X-Men penciler Jim Lee and his friend writer Brandon Choi, the comic book&#x27;s premise revolved around the centuries-long war between aliens called Kherubim and Daemonites. Kherubim, a nearly immortal, human-looking alien race with exceptional powers and skills, traveled to Earth and, by breeding with humans, populated the planet with &quot;Half-Breeds&quot;. Daemonites, besides having a fearsome appearance, also possessed various superhuman abilities, including body possession and mental control over human beings. The initial arc brought Voodoo over to the team as the readers&#x27; point-of-view character as Helspont, a Daemonite warlord, had taken control over Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle. Rob Liefeld&#x27;s Youngblood co-starred in the closing chapters of the arc.

&quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot;″ story continued in a three-part mini-series, penciled by Jae Lee, that introduced the Daemonite Lord Hightower. Jim Lee and Marc Silvestri proceeded to publish a &#x27;Killer Instinct&#x27; crossover detailing Warblade&#x27;s connection to Marc Silvestri&#x27;s Cyber Force.

Jim Lee devoted his time to coming up with the new concepts of &quot;Gen13&quot;, Deathblow, and &quot;Stormwatch&quot;. Before he left the book, he did the four-issue &quot;Gathering of Eagles&quot; storyline written by his &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; writer, Chris Claremont. It featured a new villain Tapestry and added the characters of Mister Majestic, Savant, and Soldier, and featured Claremont&#x27;s creator-owned character, Huntsman.

Almost all of the characters were spun off into their own mini-series, with Zealot featured in a series by Ron Marz and Terry Shoemaker, Spartan in one by Kurt Busiek and Mike McKone, Warblade sharing another with Cyberforce&#x27;s Ripclaw, Grifter co-starred in The Kindred&#x27;s limited series with Stormwatch&#x27;s Backlash by Brett Booth that led to the latter&#x27;s ongoing title, as well as another with Youngblood&#x27;s Badrock, Billy Tucci&#x27;s Shi, and even Dark Horse&#x27;s the Mask.

James Robinson wrote a handful of issues as well as a Team One Stormwatch/WildC.A.T.s mini-series detailing the past of the Wildstorm universe and would go on to write the Wildcats&#x27; first annual. The title also participated in the WildC.A.T.s-oriented &quot;Wildstorm Rising&quot; crossover that saw the heroes try to gain control of the Daemonite battleship, which turned out to be the Kheran ship instead, with WildC.A.T.s eventually leaving for Khera. Following a Grifter one-shot, the crossover gave birth to a short-lived Steven Seagle-written Grifter series that centered on his super-spy/superhero adventures while linking to an obscure Team One character Regiment at one point.

Alan Moore then took over writing duties, and proceeded to tell a tale split between Savant and Majestic&#x27;s replacement team on Earth and the original team journeying to Khera. The Kherubim had won the Daemonite-Kherubim war and were living in prosperity. Appearances were deceiving, however, and it was apparent the planet was run by power-hungry politicians who had ruthlessly subjugated the Daemonites as second-class citizens. Voodoo, with her Daemonite blood, experienced this firsthand. Maul&#x27;s race was also treated unjustly and though Emp and Zealot were seduced by promises of power and recognition, Spartan discovered the truth about Khera&#x27;s corrupt leaders. It took the death of one of Maul&#x27;s race for the WildC.A.T.s to leave and head back for Earth. Voodoo and Emp both left the team, while the remainder joined with Savant and Majestic&#x27;s new team. Moore also participated in Fire From Heaven, a fairly continuity-heavy crossover that resolved plotlines regarding Team One, Team 7, and Kaizen Gamorra.

Alan Moore, Mike Lopez and Al Rio spun Voodoo off in a four-issue mini-series that dealt with voodoo magic, while Moore also wrote a time-traveling WildC.A.T.s/Spawn crossover mini-series drawn by Scott Clark and inked by Sal Regla.

At the time, Grifter had another turn at an ongoing series, this time written by Steven Grant and drawn by Mel Rubi and Michael Ryan, while Zealot was featured in a Backlash spinoff, &quot;Wildcore&quot;.

Barbara Randall Kesel, Pasqual Ferry, Rich Johnson and Carlos D&#x27;Anda crafted a two-part storyline that, in effect, wrote Majestic, Savant and Ladytron out of the team, and set up the spin-off &quot;Savant Garde&quot;, written by Randall Kesel. Original scripter Brandon Choi returned alongside Johnathan Peterson and artists Mat Broome and Ed Benes for a storyline with an organization called Puritans as the main villains. The Puritans&#x27; goal was to eradicate the Kherubim and Daemonites on Earth by traveling back in time and erasing killing them before the aliens could influence global events. A new line-up of WildC.A.T.s traveled in time to stop the Puritans, and had various adventures throughout different time periods.

===&quot;Wildcats&quot; volume 1 (1999)===
After the first series&#x27; cancellation, WildStorm, now an imprint of DC Comics, resurrected the Wildcats under a whole different premise—Wildcats dealt with the lives of the original members after the team&#x27;s breakup following a botched mission during which team member Zealot apparently died. Scott Lobdell provided the writing for the initial seven issues as well as a Mosaic one-shot detailing the change in Lord Emp, with Travis Charest penciling most of them. New villains like Kenyan and CC Rendozzo were featured as antagonists, but it was all dropped very quickly, with Charest leaving the monthly comic format to work on a French Metabarons graphic novel called &quot;Dreamshifters&quot; and Lobdell exiting a couple of issues later.

As Joe Casey and Sean Phillips took over Wildcats, they quickly dealt away with Kenyan, while Void and Emp ended up having Spartan absorb their assets and powers; thus the book began a long spell featuring him aided by Ladytron and Grifter with Maul and Voodoo guest-starring, as well as new characters Noir, and Agents Wax and Mohr of the National Park Service. Warblade was featured very briefly, last seen in the Wildcats 2000 annual that brought back the dead version Condition Red killing Olympia. Casey and Phillips signaled the new Wildstorm, critically acclaimed but low on readers&#x27; radar. The heroes fought Samuel Smith (a superhuman serial killer whose grandfather had appeared in Team One: WildC.A.T.s) after which eventually Zealot returned. Casey also wrote the Ladytron one shot, a farsic rendition of her past, as well as a Mister Majestic ongoing series which ran for nine issues.

&quot;Wild Times: Wildcats&quot; and &quot;Wild Times: Grifter&quot; were published as one-shots as a part of the crossover series &quot;Wild Times&quot; that spotlighted the characters in Elseworlds-like alternate reality scenarios that blended genres. Wildcats also participated in the WildC.A.T.s/Aliens crossover written by Stormwatch&#x27;s Warren Ellis that served as a coda to that series and a prequel to his Authority run, having very little to do with the Wildcats themselves.

===&quot;Wildcats&quot; 3.0 (2002)===
The third series, &quot;Wildcats Version 3.0&quot;, was a part of the mature readers&#x27; Eye of the Storm imprint, dealing with Spartan&#x27;s (now Jack Marlowe) agenda to better the world by proliferating advanced technology and power sources throughout the world via the HALO Corporation. Grifter was his troubleshooter and Agent Wax was one of his first associates. The stories added a motley group to this proactive organization including the power broker C.C. Rendozzo and her organization, Agent Orange, and Grifter&#x27;s unlikely pupil Edwin Dolby, one of HALO&#x27;s accountants. The series ended with a thunderous finale where Zealot, Marlowe, and a team assembled by Grifter destroyed the Coda chapter that Zealot had created on Earth. The series was written by Joe Casey and drawn by Dustin Nguyen, Duncan Rouleau, Francisco Ruiz Velasco, Pascual Ferry and Sean Phillips.

Concurrent with &quot;Wildcats Version 3.0&quot;, Wildstorm also published a critically acclaimed noir-superhero series &quot;Sleeper&quot; starring Alan Moore&#x27;s Wildcats villain Tao, which also featured Grifter. As part of the crossover Coup D&#x27;État, centering on the Wildstorm Universe&#x27;s United States, a Wildcats 3.0: Coup D&#x27;État one-shot was released.

After guest-starring in Superman books, in 2004 DC published a &quot;Mr. Majestic&quot; mini-series to test waters for an ongoing series that ran for 17 issues.

Wildcats starred in a limited series by Robbie Morrison and Talent Caldwell entitled &quot;Wildcats: Nemesis&quot;, focusing on Zealot, Majestic, and the Coda continuity, while heavily spotlighting the new Wildstorm universe anti-hero character of Nemesis.

At the same time, Wildstorm published the &quot;Captain Atom: Armageddon&quot; maxi-series, heavily featuring the Wildcats as they tried to help DC character Captain Atom return to his universe and stop him from accidentally destroying their reality. Nikola, a female medic, became the new Void with Captain Atom sharing a part of the power that eventually remade the Wildstorm universe altogether.

===&quot;Wildcats: Nemesis&quot; (2005)===
&quot;Wildcats: Nemesis&quot; was a 9-issue miniseries, published from November 2005 to July 2006. Written by Robbie Morrison and illustrated by various artists, it featured Nemesis and Wildcats. In 2006 it was collected into a trade paperback ().

===&quot;Wildcats&quot; volume 3 (2006)===
In 2006, as part of the &quot;Worldstorm&quot; line-wide event, the title was restarted, written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Jim Lee. The team consisted of Spartan, Mr. Majestic, Zealot, Grifter, Voodoo, Savant, and Ladytron. Warblade is on a secret mission, and Maul has retired to his civilian identity. Kaizen Gamorra returned as the villain, aided by the WildCats&#x27; first enemy, Helspont. However, the title was permanently put on hold after only three issues.

===&quot;Wildcats&quot; volume 4 (2008)===
In July 2008 Wildstorm debuted a new ongoing &quot;WildCats&quot; series written by Christos Gage and pencilled by Neil Googe following on from the imprint&#x27;s &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; mini-series. Adam Beechen took over writing duties from Gage in late 2009, with he and artist Tim Seeley starting with issue #19 until the book&#x27;s cancellation in December 2010 with #30.

===&quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; volume 2 (2022)===
In November 2022 (cover date January 2023), DC debuted &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; the second volume to feature the same abbreviated stylization in the title as the first series in 1992. Written by Matthew Rosenberg and illustrated by Stephen Segovia, it sees Grifter working for the HALO Corporation to assemble a group of operatives to embark upon missions in the outskirts of the DC Universe. Its first task is to round up an elite group of scientists, which puts the group into conflict with the scientists&#x27; mysterious leader, Void. The team also comes into conflict with a shadowy organization called the Court of Owls.

==Cast==
===Original team===
The original WildC.A.T.s (Covert Action Team) consisted of:
* Spartan (Jack Marlowe, originally Hadrian-7): Originally intended to be a highly sophisticated cyborg who could &quot;die&quot; and easily be downloaded to another body, Spartan&#x27;s character has been revised several times. Spartan was one many Spartan-series androids made in Khera, modeled after the Kherubim hero Yohn Kohl, who would go on to be known on Earth as John Colt. After Colt&#x27;s apparent death in battle, Jacob Marlowe implanted some of Colt&#x27;s memories and personality in Spartan&#x27;s bodies. Additionally, Jacob had a scientist design Spartan&#x27;s artificial intelligence, knowing the scientist would model it after his deceased son-in-law, Zachary Krieger, which Jacob claimed he&#x27;d done in order to grant Spartan an affinity with humanity, which had the side effect of prevent Colt&#x27;s personality from overwhelming him. Spartan had something of an on-again, off-again relationship with Voodoo. Eventually, Colt&#x27;s memories and personality returned, and, for some time, Spartan considered himself John Colt. While another Spartan unit without Colt&#x27;s memories would go on to be activated, and John Colt would leave the team, eventually the Colt personality receded. After Emp&#x27;s death, Spartan assumed the identity of Jack Marlowe, Jacob&#x27;s &quot;nephew&quot; and became the C.E.O. of Halo. Later still, he absorbed Void&#x27;s powers, making him one of the most powerful beings in the Wildstorm Universe. Jack went on to turn away from the role of super-hero, attempting to make the world a better place by introducing highly advanced Kheran technology into human society. At some point, he lost Void&#x27;s powers. Spartan went on propose to Voodoo in the Carrier. All of Spartan&#x27;s bodies possess some degree of incredible strength and endurance and are capable of flight (however, it was explained that he flew only when necessary because it took up so much power from his energy reserves), ionizing gases into controlled plasma blasts and interfacing with electronic systems through a variety of ports in his body.
*Grifter (Cole Cash): A former government operative and member of Team 7, Grifter is a skilled marksman and hand-to-hand combatant. Found by Zealot after gaining Gen-Active powers as a result of Team 7&#x27;s exposure to Gen Factor, Zealot helped him recover from the ordeal and taught him how to completely remove his power, as well as bring it back at will. Zealot also trained him in Coda combat techniques, making him the only man ever trained by the Coda. He was the only member of the original team not to use any active post-human powers. Grifter left the team for the first time after Jacob made a pact with Hightower, the man responsible for killing Cole&#x27;s friend Lonely, leading to his time as a solo agent, chronicled in his two ongoing series. He eventually rejoined the WildC.A.T.s and, over the years, as the team would reform and disband many times, Cole maintained ties to Halo and his teammates, particularly Jack Marlowe. Grifter sustained severe injuries to his legs during a mission, and went on to use a wheelchair for some time, eventually using Ladytron&#x27;s robotic body as a remote-controlled stand-in in the field. Grifter&#x27;s powers eventually healed his wounded legs, allowing him to walk once again.
*Zealot (Lady Zannah): A Kherubim and a Coda warrior. Zealot is the former Majestrix of the Coda and helped develop their virtues and practices. She has lived for thousands of years and has had many relationships with both humans and aliens alike. In Khera, Zealot was ordered to breed with Majestros, which she did, resulting in the birth of Savant. However, since bearing a child would change Zealot&#x27;s social standing and ensure she could never be a warrior ever again, Zealot&#x27;s mother Harmony convinced her to lie to everyone that the child was stillborn, while Harmony pretended that the child was, in fact, hers. The child was named Kenesha and raised as Zealot&#x27;s sister, though Kenesha would become best known by the name Savant. Zealot left the Coda, believing they did not follow the order&#x27;s true precepts, and she would go on to fight against the Coda on multiple occasions. She was part of Team One under the alias Lucy Blaze. Zealot was once in a romantic relationship with Grifter, and the two went on to have various flings over the years. Zealot left the Wildcats and briefly joined Department PSI and co-led WildCORE with Backlash, a half-Kheran and former member of Team 7. In later years, Zealot faked her own death and began hunting Coda on her own, before being brought back to Wildcats.
* Voodoo (Priscilla Kitaen): A telepathic human-Kherubim-Daemonite hybrid ancestry, Voodoo has the ability to see Daemonites who have possessed other beings and remove them from the bodies they have possessed. Voodoo was an exotic dancer before being rescued by the WildC.A.T.s from the Daemonites. She was later trained by Zealot in combat and developed an attraction to Spartan. It was eventually revealed that one of her ancestors, was the result of an attempt to splice a Kherubim with the body of a Daemonite. When the WildC.A.T.s went to Khera, Priscilla discovered that the Kherubim-Daemonite War had ended centuries prior, and was treated as a second-class citizen due to her Daemonite ancestry. Disillusioned with the WildC.A.T.s, and particularly with Zealot and Emp, Pris left the team, journeying to New Orleans, where she studied voodoo magic. Voodoo briefly returned to the WildC.A.T.s, although the team would go on to be disbanded and reformed and, ultimately, after Zealot&#x27;s apparent death, the team members went their separate ways for what appeared to be the last time. Pris eventually moved in with former teammate Jeremy Stone. Priscilla was targeted by post-human serial killer Samuel Smith, who used his powers to sever both her legs and injure her throat. Priscilla was contacted by a benevolent Daemonite, considered to be a conscientious objector to the Kheran-Daemonite war, who helps her hone her hithertho unknown healing and time dilation powers, allowing Pris to regrow her legs. She went on to date Jeremy, though they eventually broke up. Pris rejoined the Wildcats after the Armageddon event, and soon became romantically involved with Spartan once again. Spartan eventually proposed to her. Aside from her telepathic, healing and time dilation powers, Voodoo is an empath, capable of sensing people&#x27;s emotions, and has been trained in the use of voodoo magic, being able to commune with and raise the dead, though the first time she attempted the latter, she found herself rapidly drained.
* Maul (Jeremy Stone): A human/Titanthrope hybrid capable of increasing his size and mass at the cost of his reasoning capability, Maul experiences powerful rage and is actually a Nobel-prize-winning scientist named Dr. Jeremy Stone. He eventually discovered he could increase his intelligence by decreasing his body mass, but this proved to be physically depleting.
* Warblade (Reno Bryce): A human/Kherubim hybrid and member of Khera&#x27;s Shaper&#x27;s Guild, Warblade can transform his body into liquid metal, and shape himself into a variety of bladed weapons and sharp objects, as well as withstand immense trauma, including massive explosions and exposure to intense heat. Warblade is also an accomplished martial artist. Although a virtual killing machine, Reno also has the soul of an artist, having his sculpted work displayed in major art galleries. While Reno stayed away from the Wildcats for a while, he returned to the team after the Armageddon event.
* Void (Adrianna Tereshkova): She has the ability to see the future and teleport herself and others to anywhere on Earth due to her absorption of an Orb of Power. Over time, Void grew more and more distant from humanity and the part of her spirit that was Adrianna moved on to the afterlife. The Void entity existed without any host for a short time, until Noir sabotaged Void&#x27;s voyage to another dimension, resulting in the Void entity disintegrating. Jack Marlowe then went on to absorb Void&#x27;s powers before it bonded with paramedic Nikola Hanssen.
* Lord Emp (Jacob Marlowe): A Kherubim lord, Emp has assumed a variety of guises throughout his time on Earth, his best known alias being Jacob Marlowe, owner of the Halo Corporation. Throughout most of Emp&#x27;s time in the Wildcats, he possessed little control over his powers, mostly serving as the team leader and advisor, usually not going out into the field. Emp eventually began a process known as the Ascension, in which he transformed into a more obvious alien being. In order to finally ascend, Emp needed someone to kill him and eventually was forced to ask Spartan to do so, to which Spartan complied. Emp&#x27;s final appearance was in the Wildstorm: A Celebration of 25 Years special, in which he contacts and counsels Spartan from beyond.

===Savant&#x27;s team===
A second team was introduced later in the series. They were formed after the original team, rumored to be dead, had left for Khera, the Kherubim homeworld. This unlikely group broke from the WildC.A.T.s usual anti-Daemonite agenda and conducted a proactive war on criminals. This alienated them from many other characters in the Wildstorm universe.
* Mister Majestic (Lord Majestros): Another Kherubim warlord who is one of four that had been stuck on Earth. Mr. Majestic is a Superman homage. Much like Superman, Majestic possesses amazing strength, endurance and speed, is capable of flight and generating heat beams from his eyes, though he has also appeared to possess some form telekinesis and the ability to project energy blasts from his hands, and is also a genius inventor and a skilled swordsman.
* Savant (Kenesha): The daughter of Majestic and Zealot (unbeknownst to Savant or Majestic) who was raised as Zealot&#x27;s sister, Savant is an adventurer and archaeologist who has worked for the Smithsonian and possesses many artifacts of mystic power and advanced technologies, including her Seven-League Boots, which essentially allow their user the power of teleportation, and a tesseract bag which contains an almost infinite amount of objects as well as entire rooms within.
* Condition Red (Max Cash, also known as Max Profitt): Grifter&#x27;s younger brother, Max Cash had excellent fighting and marksmanship abilities. Max followed Cole&#x27;s footsteps, becoming a covert operative for International Operations. Max went undercover in a crime family, and went on to kill police officers and take part in hits I.O. did not know about, which Savant used to blackmail him into joining her team. Max left the WildC.A.T.s after being caught in an explosion, partly due to Ladytron&#x27;s unrequited feelings for him and due to his injury. Max eventually went undercover once again, adopting the alias Max Profitt and joining an organization known as the Puritans, who intended to eradicate all alien life on Earth, becoming romantically involved with a Puritan named Gina DeMedici. He alerted the WildC.A.T.s to the Puritans&#x27; threat and re-joined the team, eventually traveling back in time to foil the Puritans&#x27; attempt to change history by killing Kherubim and Daemonites during various points in time. After a battle at the time of the Kherubim and Daemonites&#x27; initial arrival on Earth, Max was forced to take DeMedici&#x27;s time travel device, leaving her stranded on Earth centuries before she was even born. DeMedici joined a Coda house, and eventually died, asking that the Coda get revenge for her by killing Max. A Coda assassin ambushed Max shortly after his return and gunned him down, killing him. He was resurrected as a zombie for one annual in the second series.
*Tao: An artificially produced human being with peculiar thinking abilities that enables him to be inhumanly persuasive and incredibly intuitive. Tao, as he would eventually be known, joined the WildC.A.T.s and manipulated them into starting a war against post-human criminals in order to create a post-human army made of the WildC.A.T.s and other super-heroes that he would command. When his manipulations were discovered, Tao attempted to escape, though, eventually, Majestic caught up with and apparently killed him. Tao eventually sent Savant a letter revealing that he had brainwashed the shapeshifter known as Mr. White into assuming his form and believing himself to be Tao, and that it was Mr. White who Majestic had apparently killed, while Tao had escaped. He later re-appeared, having founded a worldwide criminal organization that aimed to destabilize human global governments, public institutions, and age-old secret societies, though his plans were foiled by undercover I.O. agent Holden Carver, as well as Tao&#x27;s second-in-command Miss Misery, John Lynch of Gen13 and Grifter.
* Ladytron (Maxine Manchester): A cyborg punk with homicidal tendencies. She was captured by the Wildcats and, through T.A.O.&#x27;s reprogramming, convinced to join the team. She admired the cybernetic mercenary Overtkill and was romantically interested in Max Cash, though her interest was not returned. When T.A.O. was revealed as a traitor, he disabled her robotic body and Ladytron was taken to the Church of Gort. She became a nun for this new age cult devoted to robotics but had a falling out with its members because she still contained organic body parts. She ended up with the Wildcats again but was wounded by the serial killer Samuel Smith. The damage was so extensive that Ladytron was shut down. A short stint as Noir&#x27;s reprogrammed pawn later, Ladytron&#x27;s mind was downloaded into the Halo mainframe and her body was used by the wheelchair-bound Grifter as a remote-controlled stand-in.

===Savant Garde===
For a time Kenesha would drop out of the hero circuit and return to a life of Indiana Jones-lite spelunking for the hidden reliquary, along the way she would assemble her own team of adventurers with Majestros at her side.
*Sheba: A humanoid feline metamorph with tactical probability based powers and no known historical background, she would clash with Savant and co while they were out hunting for artifacts in the Amazon Basin. Little to nothing is known about her other than the fact that she may be related to the Kindred a mutated race of anthropomorphic animals created by the Gen-Factor. She would later return during the World&#x27;s End event as a beneficiary to Stormwatch&#x27;s Paris, who found a perfectly habitual forest which had survived the superhuman cataclysm and later teaming up with the WildC.A.T.s to rebuild their damaged world.
*Mabel Blight: Ace pilot and possibly more than she appears at first glance. Mabel is the closest thing to a best friend Kenesha has in her life, she was the one who got Savant out of her slump after her disastrous stint as leader of the WildC.A.T.s. Mabel is allegedly human with no known superpowers but her partner in crime once stated she&#x27;d died several times in the past. Indicating she may have some regenerative or rebirthing abilities.
*Disperse: A human mystic from a different dimension where arcane forces reign supreme, Capri Toriamo used to be a guerrilla freedom fighter who stood against the tyranny of many overlords in his world of magic. After having dealt with Tapestry, his mother, an alternate counterpart of Katrina Kupertino; would encourage him to leave their war torn Earth to travel with Savant&#x27;s group for a time. Disperse is a mage with vast shape shifting abilities that enable him to take on the form and abilities of whomever or whatever he&#x27;s mimicking. He was last seen aiding in the battle against the Knight of Khera after the World&#x27;s End event.
*Cybernary (Katrina Kupertino/Yumiko Gamorra): A powerful next-gen bionic hunter-killer spawned on the lawless Island Gamorra. Katrina was a low rent street hustler who traded her life and her humanity for her best friend Cisco&#x27;s freedom, now sharing the consciousness of the despot Kaizen Gamorra&#x27;s daughter; Yumiko Gamorra, they live in a tumultuous union body and mind as they travel the world with the newfound companions. Cybernary has several retrofitted abilities thanks to her cybernetic enhancements. Such as a tactical computer, enhanced physicals pertaining to strength, speed, resilience and stamina, she&#x27;s even able to secrete mind controlling pheromones that enable her to influence peoples directives. The personality governing Yumiko&#x27;s consciousness can initiate a doomsday virus dispersal system which would blanket the world in water catalyzing agent which will kill-off all non cyber life. Cybernary would act as an adversary to the Authority after the World&#x27;s End calamity while working under her hated father Kaizen when he attacked them. Then became a subsidiary under Zannah&#x27;s new Coda training grounds after her bionics were removed and then (allegedly) replenished after the Knights of Khera battle. 
*Miranda: A cyber-shrink who helped Katrina/Yumiko through their gestalt identity crisis after having been reactivated by her deranged creator. She would escape Gamorra along with Cybernary while the nation devolved into civil conflict just before the Fire From Heaven event to act as Met-L&#x27;s caretaker and pilot.
*Met-L (Albert Kaplan): Once a criminal underworld degenerate under the surname of Cisco, Albert was the partner of Katrina before she became a transorganic cyber assassin. A bupkis job led to Cisco&#x27;s incarceration in a Gamorran hunter killer manufacturing facility where his partner came to rescue him while he lay on the table. After she gave her life in exchange for his freedom, Katrina was later cheated and Cisco was secretly remodeled into an animal themed hunter killer cyborg for gladiatorial entertainment for Gamorra&#x27;s denizens. Cybernary would do battle with and ultimately dispatch of the aberration that was once her trusted confidante, but she managed to save a hard-copy of Mr. Kaplan&#x27;s persona and have his mental engrams imprinted on a Multi-Environmental Transformation-Laborer Class automaton; Met-L for short.

===Time travel team===
The team consisted of Grifter, Max Cash, Void, and an old Spartan unit activated by Grifter, possessing Hadrian&#x27;s original personality, as well as new members:
*Mythos: A powerful mystic and Kherubim lord, Mythos possesses super-human physical attributes, particularly strength and speed, being capable of moving so fast normal humans cannot see him.
*Olympia: A Daemonite mercenary who has Coda training. She took in a teenager named Kai as her ward. When Max Cash was killed by a Coda warrior, Olymbia broke into her cell and killed the Coda, an act which led Jacob to kick her out of the team and inform her that, as long as she kept away from the WildC.A.T.s, the team would not seek to apprehend her. She was killed by a resurrected Max Cash during the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot; crossover.
*Sister Eve: a former nun who lived in a convent in South Bend, who, unbeknownst to herself, was Lord Entropy&#x27;s daughter. She can generate a &quot;chaos field&quot;, allowing her to break molecular bonds, thus generating destructive energy. She can only control her power by wearing a pair of inhibiting gloves and a dampening cloak. Sister Eve was killed after using all her power to stop an avalanche from hitting the other members of the team, draining her to such an extent that she quickly died.

===Halo Team===
After a disastrous mission wherein Zealot faked her death to hunt down the earth Coda chapter. The Cat&#x27;s, whittled down to Jacob and Spartan, would go on to recruit both old faces and new blood after Lord Emp had ascended.
*Noir: A French arms dealer whom would offer his expertise to the Halo Corporation, for a price. Later killed by Jacob&#x27;s successor Jack Marlowe, a.k.a. Spartan, when the treacherous individual tried to usurp the company for acquisition of its access to Otherspace using a retrofit of Maxine Manchester&#x27;s inert remains to kill his employer and employing French hitmen to do away with Cole Cash.
*Anthony Pacheco: A captain of the Los Angeles Police Force&#x27;s C.R.A.S.H. Department seeking Jack Marlowe&#x27;s aid of in dealing with a local drug baron selling &amp; dealing on the mean streets of his precinct. Despite having easily removed the narco&#x27;s distributing the metabolic and cognitive perception booster called Hype, officer Pacheco was revealed to&#x27;ve partaken of the narcotic himself. Jack chose to trust the good samaritan&#x27;s judgement while leaving the production facilities behind in his care regardless.

===3.0 cast===
Besides Grifter and Jack Marlowe, the main characters were:
*Grifter II (Edwin Dolby): Jack Marlowe&#x27;s main accountant and right-hand man in the Halo Corporation. When Grifter&#x27;s legs were seriously injured in a mission, Cole brought him up to speed about Halo&#x27;s more exotic exploits with the intent of training Dolby to be his replacement after learning of Dolby&#x27;s natural aptitude for marksmanship. Dolby, however, refused to kill. Despite this, Dolby was sent on a mission, during which he panicked and accidentally crippled a man. He suffered a mental breakdown and quit Halo, but Marlowe was able to convince him to return by reinforcing his belief in the success of Halo&#x27;s mission. In an attempt to end his nightmares over the mission, he agrees to help Grifter and his team rescue Zealot from the Coda.
*Agent Orange: Another mole of Jack Marlowe&#x27;s, this time at the FBI. Agent Orange is an enhanced human who can be mentally programmed for certain tasks. Said operative&#x27;s blood had been replaced by the compound dioxin bestowing superhuman strength, durability, healing and endurance. Never speaking or showing any emotion, Agent Orange is quite similar in appearance and behavior to The Terminator. Whilst Grifter meets with Maul in Miami, Orange is sent out by the FBI alongside agents Cave and Cartman to dispatch them both but was undone when a Central Intelligence Agency program gained sentience and aided them by sending Orange a shutdown code. Later when Cole and his team get in over their heads while attempting to rescue Zealot from the Coda, Marlowe activates Agent Orange, who finds Zealot and brings her to Grifter&#x27;s team.
*Ramon A eugenically enhanced tween intellect born from a testing beaker in the services of the underworld affiliate Cecelia Rendozzo. After Marlowe&#x27;s people did his employer a hefty service, Ramon would aid grifter with a neural uplink system which would enable him to go on field missions using Ladytron&#x27;s inert mechanical body as a proxy for field missions. He and C.C&#x27;s son are constantly at odds with one another.
*Sam Garfield: A secondary accountant and partner to Edwin Dolby working their own business firm until it was purchased by Mr. Marlowe. While infinitely less accommodating to the rather abrupt methods of managing their services as his business associate. Being rather surprised at how nonchalantly Mr. Dolby went along with their new bosses micromanagement, offering advice on topics they usually don&#x27;t cover due to being middle management for money. A sense of tension that came to a head when after Marlowe had reassigned him to a whole new business firm which was secretly a shell company to front the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s clandestine operations. Something that Jack brings to his attention after Mr. Garfield runs afoul with the law after an altercation with a road hog, his employer covering up for Sam&#x27;s act of first degree murder; the accountant comes around to working as Spartan&#x27;s mole within the C.I.A and continues managing his new assets with a newfound calm and perspective afterwards.
*Agent Wax: Jack Marlowe&#x27;s contact at the National Park Service, a government agency tasked with monitoring superhuman activity. Wax is gifted with strong hypnotic powers, but his superiors never knew of this. He became aware of the C.A.T.s while following up leads on a superhuman serial killer in the second volume of Wildcats. Later quitting the Service after the death of his partner, despite this he never lost interest in Marlowe and his team even before later returning to NPS on the formers suggestion. Wax had often been bullied by his boss, Agent Downs; even before he left the bureau. His C.O. often forcing him into undergoing demeaning and/or aggravating tasks such as taking on a new partner; as well as forcing Wax to a desk job when he returned. The bemoaned agent would enact revenge by using his meta abilities to engage in a sexual affair with his superiors&#x27; obnoxious spouse after being slatted as her personal chofer. Wax ended up killing his superior Downs when the latter angled his employee into a confrontation in a secluded location with his wife tied up; an event said operator would disguise as a field assignment. Using his unique skills Agent Wax would then impersonate his deceased employer, effectively taking over the NPS later on to keep up appearances. Marlowe found out about this turn of events yet decided to give him a second chance seeing such happenstance as an opportunity to broaden Halo Corps. reach through the Park Service&#x27;s assets and ties to the social power structure.
*The Beef Boys: Two remarkably, possibly superhumanly, strong men dressed in S&amp;M fetish gear. Apart from running a BDSM club, they are also mercenaries who work for Grifter from time to time. The taller of the two, Glenn, never speaks, while the other, Cedric, is quite eloquent. Glenn was killed by the Coda while on mission.
*C. C. Rendozzo: A scientific criminal mastermind, ace gunman and powerful information broker who knows a great deal bout many critical plot points in the Wildstorm Universe. She&#x27;s the employer of Ramon; introduced after initially having come after Jeremy Stone due to the former&#x27;s genius work in genetic isolation and extrapolation. Having contracted a form of doomsday virus while tinkering with it for sales purposes, Cecelia would later turn up looking for an FBI agent to use as ransom for a personal matter, enlisting both Cole and Wax&#x27;s aid when they initially crossed paths. Later seeking to blackmail Jack Marlowe by using his alien origin as leverage after the initial mission went sideways. In return for her silence after giving Cecelia what she desired, she would act as an underworld contact whom Marlowe would keep in touch with; Grifter having called in a favor of her in helping rescue Zannah from the earthborn Coda Chapter she&#x27;d been attacking as of late.

===Majestic&#x27;s pact===
While not specifically part of any WildC.A.T.s group, Mister Majestic would work with his own covert action team for a time when the Shapers Guild would attempt seize earth&#x27;s Kherubim terraforming engine to make a new Khera. Members would include mainstays like Spartan, Zealot and Savant while also including:
*Desmond: Longtime sidekick and child super genius aide to Majestros in his earlier years, after his friend went on to become a Universal; a conclave of super celestials whom Majestros&#x27;s father was a part of. Desmond would go onto create his own xenotechnological sales company called Quickthink Incorporated, a business industry which reverse engineers and amalgamates kherubim technology into human engineering.
*Lady Harmony: A high Priestess of the Kherubim Coda sect known as the Skein and the mother of Zeolot.
*Imperator: Rival Kherubim Lord and advocate of House Khull on the Pantheon, aiding Harmony and her forces to stand against the rogue shaper sect&#x27;s incursion of Earth. His true goal was to take the Shaper Engine in the name of his family house to lord over the failing Khera.
*Lord Helspont: Long standing enemy and bitterest rival to the Kheran sanctioned WildC.A.T.s. The Daemon Royal would offer his services in aid against the Shaper&#x27;s Guild for his own agendas.

===Nemesis Crew===
The introduction of rogue Kherubum warrior Lady Charis would be first adversarial too, then join up with a team consisting of Majestros, Zannah, Cole Cash and Kenesha. A team which would later be adjourned by former WildC.A.T.s mainstays such as Jeremy, Reno and Priscilla while battling the mutated human forces of the Brotherhood of the Sword.
*Nemesis: A Coda warrior and former lover of Majestic. Having been framed by Raven and the Brotherhood of the Blade, who collaborated with like-minded Daemonites to overthrow their masters back home to conquer the galaxy, she would be hunted and hated by her former compatriots as a traitor to the Kheran war effort for eons till modern day. When the Brotherhood began their assault, transforming humans into posthuman warriors for their cause.

===&quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;===
With the &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot; crossover, original Wildcats Spartan, Zealot, Voodoo, Grifter, Maul, Nemesis and Warblade were brought together again to help save what was left of the human race. Their membership also included Ladytron as well as a few new members:
*Backlash (real name Jodi Slayton, formerly known as Jet): The daughter of the original Backlash. She possesses superhuman speed and reflexes.

Nemesis subsequently went missing following the teams battle with Majestic, while Savant rejoined the team.

In August 2007 &quot;Alan Moore&#x27;s Complete WildC.A.T.S&quot; TPB was released, containing the contents of both &quot;Gang War&quot; and &quot;Homecoming&quot; TPBs, as well as the short story from &quot;WildC.A.T.S&quot; #50.

==Reception==
Andy Butcher reviewed the first graphic novel compendium of &quot;WildC.A.T.s: Covert Action Teams&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that &quot;of all the artists who&#x27;ve tried to write, Lee is one of the more successful. Despite some confusing flashbacks at the start, he is at least capable of stringing a story together. As long as you concentrate (a lot of characters and factions are introduced very quickly), it&#x27;s an enjoyable if fairly linear tale. And of course, the art is simply stunning.&quot;

==In other media==

===TV series===

A &quot;Wild C.A.T.s&quot; TV series was created in 1994. It had only thirteen episodes and a more family-friendly storyline. As a result, there were numerous changes from the source material, such as Voodoo being an adolescent rather than an ex-stripper and Lord Emp being an ordinary human. The group was composed of all the original &#x27;C.A.T.s. The major villain was Helspont, but the Troika and the Coda were featured. A parody of the series, MadD.O.G.s, was seen during Alan Moore&#x27;s run in the comics. The series was produced by Nelvana Limited and WildStorm Productions.

===Toyline===
A toyline from Playmates Toys was also released in 1994. The basic series included figures of Grifter, Helspont, Maul, Spartan, Warblade and Zealot, along with a generic Daemonite figure. In 1995, new versions of Helspont, Maul, Spartan, Warblade, and Zealot were released, along with figures of Pike, Void, and Voodoo, and a WildC.A.T.S. Bullet Bike accessory. In addition, Playmates also produced &quot;giant&quot; versions of Grifter, Maul, and Spartan, plus figures for other characters in the Image Universe, such as Black Razor, Mr. Majestic, and Slag.

===Video game===
In 1995, Playmates Interactive Entertainment published a WildC.A.T.s video game exclusively for the Super NES. A WildC.A.T.s game for Sega Genesis was planned but never released.

<text>Grass Valley (formerly known as Thomson Grass Valley and Grass Valley Group) is a manufacturer of television production and broadcasting equipment. Headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, it was formed by the March 2014 merger of the original Grass Valley with Miranda Technologies, which were both acquired by American networking company Belden in 2014 and 2012, respectively. In February 2018, owners Belden merged Grass Valley with newly acquired Snell Advanced Media (formerly known as Quantel Ltd, Snell, Snell &amp; Wilcox, Snell Limited, SAM, and Snell Group). On July 2, 2020, Grass Valley announced the completion of its acquisition by private equity firm Black Dragon Capital from Belden Inc.

== History ==

Grass Valley Group was founded as a research and development company in 1959 by Dr. Donald Hare in Grass Valley, California, in the foothills of California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada range. Hare chose Grass Valley after learning about it from his friend, Charles Litton Sr. In 1964, Grass Valley demonstrated its first video product, a video distribution amplifier in a hotel room at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Chicago. In 1965, Grass Valley officially attended the 1965 National Association of Broadcasters convention in Washington, D.C. On display were its processing amplifier, video distribution amplifier, Synac processing module, and sync generator. By 1968, the Grass Valley Group had introduced its first production switcher, or vision mixer, that &quot;came to define the industry standard.&quot;

The company merged with Tektronix in 1974. When Tektronix divested its printing, video, and networking divisions it sold the video business to a private investor, Terry Gooding of San Diego, California, who reincorporated it under the name Grass Valley Group, Inc. The sale closed on September 24, 1999.

In 2002, the French electronics company Thomson Multimedia, now known as Technicolor SA, acquired Grass Valley Group. After coming under the ownership of Thomson, Grass Valley Group merged its product line with the existing professional and broadcast products of its new parent company.

In 2005, Thomson purchased Canopus Corporation to add to Grass Valley&#x27;s business, also adopting its video-editing software Edius.

After the financial crisis of 2008, Thomson defaulted on its financial covenants and was forced by its creditors to divest its Grass Valley business, PRN, and other manufacturing entities. On January 29, 2009, Thomson announced it was putting the Grass Valley division up for sale.

In 2010, the Grass Valley business unit, not including the head-end and transmission businesses, was acquired by private equity firm Francisco Partners and resumed operating as an independent company with offices in San Francisco, California, on January 1, 2011. The company announced in August 2013 it would move its headquarters to Hillsboro, Oregon, later that year to an existing office.

On March 31, 2014, the company was acquired from Francisco Partners by Belden Inc. and merged with Miranda Technologies, which Belden acquired on July 27, 2012. The merged company operates as Grass Valley.

In 2018, Belden acquired SAM (re-badged from Quantel) and merged it into Grass Valley.

On October 30, 2019, Belden Inc. put Grass Valley up for sale, listing it as a &quot;discontinued operation&quot; on its books.

On February 4, 2020, Black Dragon Capital signed a definitive agreement with Belden Inc. to acquire Grass Valley. The transaction closed in the first half of 2020, following the receipt of regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. More recently, the Grass Valley logo is rendered without &quot;A Belden Brand&quot; byline, marking the company&#x27;s departure from Belden.

On July 2, 2020, Grass Valley announced the completion of its acquisition from Belden Inc. by private equity firm Black Dragon Capital.

On July 2, 2020, Grass Valley entered a Pledge And Security Agreement with MGG Investment Group LP of New York, NY. Under the terms of the Agreement, Grass Valley assigned to MGG a security interest in substantially all of its global assets (including intellectual property) as collateral for a term loan made to Grass Valley.

On November 9, 2021, Grass Valley announced the removal of former CEO Tim Shoulders and the appointment of Louis Hernandez as executive chairman.

On January 10, 2022, Nicola Wealth, a Canadian investment firm, announced the acquisition of Grass Valley&#x27;s headquarters at 3499 Douglas B Floreani Street, Saint-Laurent (Montréal), in Quebec.

On March 9, 2022, Grass Valley announced the appointment of Andrew Cross as chief executive officer. As of November 1, 2022, Andrew Cross is listed as advisor on the company&#x27;s website.

On March 3, 2023, Grass Valley completed the sale of its former U.S. headquarters facility located at 125 Crown Point Court in Grass Valley, California, to the non-profit organization InConcert Sierra. The buyer&#x27;s agent reported the final sell price was less than the original list price of US$3.1 million.

Its product line includes cameras, live production switchers, replay and highlights products, media storage, editing, asset management, modular infrastructure, routing, conversion equipment, control, monitoring, and automated playout, sold as hardware, software, and software as a service (SaaS).

<doc id="585172" wikidata="Q1533374" url="?curid=585172" title="Go (1999 film)">
<text>Go is a 1999 American crime comedy film written by John August and directed by Doug Liman, with intertwining plots involving three sets of characters. The film stars William Fichtner, Katie Holmes, Jay Mohr, Sarah Polley, and Scott Wolf and features Taye Diggs, Breckin Meyer, Timothy Olyphant, Desmond Askew, Jane Krakowski, J. E. Freeman, and Melissa McCarthy in her film debut.

The film is set around Christmas. Ronna Sarah Polley, a clerk at a grocery store, is facing eviction if she doesn&#x27;t come up with &quot;more money then she has.&quot; While at work, Ronna is propositioned by two actors ( Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr )for drugs, Ronna comes up with an idea to score drugs from dealer Todd Gaines Timothy Olyphant and sell them at a higher price in order to pay her rent. Ronna&#x27;s plan goes array when she realizes that she is caught up in a sting. Disposing of the drugs in order to avoid arrest, Ronna finds herself in an even worse financial situation. To recoup her losses, Ronna makes the decision to return allergy pills to Todd and say that her deal fell through. From here, three wild and amusing stories intertwine.

The film underperformed at the box office but was critically acclaimed.

==Plot==

Around Christmas, Ronna, working overtime at her supermarket job to avoid being evicted, is approached by Adam and Zack to buy 20 hits of ecstasy, which they had hoped to buy from her absent co-worker, Simon.

After work, Ronna approaches Simon&#x27;s dealer, Todd, for the pills. She is unable to pay the full amount so she leaves her friend Claire with Todd as collateral. Ronna meets with Adam and Zack but grows suspicious of Burke, a stranger accompanying them who presses her for the ecstasy. She flushes the drugs down the toilet and leaves, then steals over-the-counter pills to replace them, helped by Manny, who had covertly swallowed two of the ecstasy pills, unaware of their strength. Ronna gives 20 of the fake pills to Todd. She, Claire, and Manny then go to a rave where she sells the rest of the fake pills as ecstasy.

Todd realizes the pills are fake and pursues Ronna to the rave. Ronna flees, hiding the now incapacitated Manny in an alley and promising to return with her car. Todd confronts her with a gun in the parking lot when she is hit by a car that speeds away, leaving her motionless in a ditch.

The story restarts from the perspective of Simon, who is on a trip to Las Vegas with Marcus, Tiny, and Singh. Simon crashes a wedding and has sex with two of the bridesmaids before they accidentally set their hotel room on fire. Simon and Marcus leave the hotel, stealing a Ferrari whose owner thinks Marcus is a parking valet.

The two go to a strip club where Simon enrages the bouncer, Victor Jr., by groping one of the strippers. Simon shoots Victor Jr. in the arm with a gun that he found in the car. He and Marcus flee to the hotel, rousing Tiny and Singh. A car chase ensues and the four barely escape the bouncer and his father, Victor Sr., but Victor Sr. traces Todd&#x27;s address from his credit card, which Simon had borrowed.

The story changes perspective to Adam and Zack, actors in a soap opera who are in a relationship with one another. Having been busted for drug possession, they are coerced into working for Burke, a police detective, to entrap their dealer. Adam is fitted with a wire. As Simon is absent, the two arrange to buy drugs from Ronna. When Ronna arrives later to make the deal, Zack secretly warns her so she flushes the drugs down the toilet and leaves.

After the unsuccessful bust, Burke invites Adam and Zack to Christmas dinner, where they observe strange behavior from Burke and his wife, Irene. Over dinner, Burke and Irene pitch a multi-level marketing company to Adam and Zack. Discussing their mutual infidelities, Adam and Zack realize they both cheated with the same person, Jimmy, and confront him at the rave.

Leaving the rave, they accidentally run over Ronna, panic, and drive away when they see Todd with a gun. Zack tries to reassure Adam that, even if Ronna had survived, Todd would have shot her. Adam realizes to his horror that he is still wearing his wire. Fearing they have been recorded, the two return to the scene to remove Ronna&#x27;s body but discover she is just unconscious. They prop her up on a car, setting off its alarm, and watch from a distance as other partygoers call an ambulance.

As morning breaks, Claire goes to a restaurant to meet up with Ronna and Manny but encounters Todd instead. The two end up going to Todd&#x27;s apartment building. While making out on the stairs, they are confronted by the two Victors. Simon arrives, having hoped to hide for a few days. The ensuing scuffle is stopped by Claire, who refuses to witness a murder.

Simon agrees to be shot in the arm by Victor Jr. as Claire leaves in disgust. Meanwhile, Ronna wakes up in a hospital and hobbles to the supermarket to start work. Realizing she left Manny at the rave, she and Claire return to the venue to find Manny pale and shaking in the alley. The three go to Ronna&#x27;s car where Ronna muses that she can now pay her rent and Manny asks what their plans are for New Year&#x27;s.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Director Doug Liman&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Swingers&quot; had been a success, and he had been asked to direct &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; next (later directed instead by David Mirkin). After watching &quot;Swingers&quot;, August felt Liman would be the perfect fit, and producer Mickey Liddell pitched &quot;Go&quot; to him. Liman felt &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; was too big-budget for a comedy, though his agent urged him to take the bigger studio film. &quot;Go&quot; had a proposed budget of around one-fifth of what he&#x27;d spend on &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;, but he liked what he considered a more difficult indie film and chose to sign on to &quot;Go&quot;.

===Writing===
Screenwriter John August originally wrote the portion of the story involving Ronna as a short film titled &quot;X&quot;, inspired by the &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Ralphs&quot; grocery store on Sunset Boulevard. After friends asked about Simon&#x27;s trip to Vegas, and what was going on with Adam and Zack, he wrote two more parts, accounting for the nature of the film. By 1998, August had been hired only as a script doctor: &quot;I was really fortunate to be getting those jobs, but I was only being considered for movies involving gnomes, elves, dwarves, and Christmas.&quot;

When August began shopping &quot;Go&quot;, big film studios were still buying spec scripts. He wanted to show them a versatile script, which would display what he was capable of. They could sell it as an action movie, a black comedy, a thriller, or however they wanted to market it.

In 1989 and 1994, Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Train&quot; and Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; popularized the concept of shooting one story from various points of view. August explained, &quot;The idea of restarting your movie was fine; it wasn&#x27;t just an experimental art-film kind of thing. It was a thing that people could have said, &#x27;Oh, it&#x27;s like &quot;that&quot;.&#x27; The &#x27;Oh, it&#x27;s like &quot;that&quot;″ has sort of been a blessing and a curse. It made it possible to make [&quot;Go&quot;], but also made it really easy to dismiss the film or to dismiss that gimmick as ″&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; did it first&#x27;.&quot; Switching from the working title &quot;X&quot;, he integrated the command &quot;Go!&quot; several times (as well as &quot;Stop!&quot;) into the script&#x27;s dialogue, each time in a different context, to create urgency as a suspenseful night worsens into a violent day. The characters&#x27; dialogue is laden with sarcastic rhetorical questions, casual profanities, and pop-cultural references.

===Filming===
To save time and prevent continuity problems, the script was fixed so that each segment begins with Ronna&#x27;s job at the supermarket. Liman committed to guerrilla filmmaking, holding a handheld camera on his shoulder to shoot while dashing from location to location, and occasionally used public places where he did not have filming permits. Often improvising, he demanded overtime from cast and crew and provided it himself.

===Casting===
Joseph Middleton was chosen as the casting director. No one was attached to the film yet, so Middleton was free to contact the actors he wanted and the script was passed around among agents. Breckin Meyer (Tiny) said the competition among young actors was fierce. &quot;&#x27;We all like this thing. I wonder who&#x27;s going to get it?&#x27; With &quot;Go&quot;, everyone knew it was a very cool script.&quot; Scott Wolf (Adam) said, &quot;The script was incredibly good. There was a lot of conversation about it.&quot;

Originally, August pictured Ronna as African American, but Sarah Polley&#x27;s performance in Atom Egoyan&#x27;s film &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; convinced Liman that she was right for the part. Polley, who resides in Canada, was offered the role directly, without auditioning; Christina Ricci was also considered in case Polley was not available. Polley declined the role several times before accepting it, as she was interested in more &quot;serious&quot; dramas, but was ultimately won over by Liman&#x27;s vision.

Middleton had seen Taye Diggs (Marcus) in the musical &quot;Rent&quot;, so Liman flew to New York to meet him and discuss the part of Simon&#x27;s friend. Katie Holmes had shot only the pilot for &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, her big break, but she had appeared in &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; and Middleton asked her to play Ronna&#x27;s less confident coworker, Claire. Timothy Olyphant auditioned for the role of either Zack or Adam and ended up with the role of drug dealer Todd Gaines.

Olyphant was a late addition; he was about to shoot the film &quot;Practical Magic&quot; but was fired from his role and replaced by Aidan Quinn, enabling him to join the cast as Todd. He was called in to audition for Adam or Zack, but all agreed he was better as drug dealer Todd, the character he wanted to play.

Actress Jennifer Coolidge urged Middleton to cast Melissa McCarthy in her first film role as Sandra. McCarthy said she was a student at the time, while Coolidge was a member of The Groundlings. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know she knew I was alive — and [Coolidge] said, &#x27;I think you should see this girl.&#x27;&quot; Middleton told McCarthy, &quot;She doesn&#x27;t do that, ever.&quot;

Although Liman found the process &quot;grueling,&quot; the producers felt lucky to find a new generation of young actors transitioning from teen films to more adult material. &quot;Go&quot; launched several big careers, actors, crew, and studio executives . Polley credits &quot;Go&quot; for later becoming a director, saying it happened as a result of a lunch meeting with Liman. She wasn&#x27;t yet sure she wanted to act, and Liman hadn&#x27;t even read the script. As a result of watching August and Liman collaborating, she was convinced to become a filmmaker.

===Financing===
Banner Entertainment decided to package &quot;Go&quot; as an independent feature with a $3.5 million budget and to bring August on as a co-producer who would be on set every day.

When &quot;Go&quot; was about to start shooting, its foreign financing fell through because the film lacked a &quot;bankable white male star.&quot; Columbia Pictures stepped in and financed the film. As most of the plot takes place at night, August recalled being &quot;outside in the dark from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. for 25 days&quot; during filming.

The producers told Liman that the car chase on the Las Vegas Strip in the second act would have to be cut for budgetary reasons. He instead dedicated almost a third of his budget to the scene and scrimped in other ways for the rest of the film. With Sony involved, the budget was raised to about $5 million. Liman sped up the production until everyone was exhausted and acted as his own cinematographer.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Go&quot; is an entertaining, clever black comedy that takes place entirely in Tarantino-land... &quot;Go&quot; has energy and wit, and the performances are right for the material – especially Sarah Polley, who thinks fast and survives harrowing experiences, and Fichtner, the cop who is so remarkably open to new experiences.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the performances of Olyphant and Fichtner, as well as &quot;Go&quot;″s energy and Liman&#x27;s direction: &quot;Artfully executed druggy flights of fancy include a hallucinatory macarena in a supermarket, a mind-reading black cat and a smart visual approximation of how it feels to be on the verge of throwing up. Here and elsewhere, Mr. Liman manipulates speed, light, editing and point of view vigorously and keeps the radio humming. He creates a film that lives up to the momentum of its title and doesn&#x27;t really need much more.&quot;

Many of the reviews were mixed. Todd McCarthy stated in &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot; &quot;Go&quot; is an overly calculated concoction that nonetheless delivers a pretty good rush.&quot; David Anson wrote in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Clever as the parts are, it doesn&#x27;t add up to much. &quot;Go&quot; has its pleasures, but I didn&#x27;t really believe a word of it.&quot; Peter Rainer&#x27;s review for &quot;New York Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;Liman (&quot;Swingers&quot;) is a virtuoso talent with a knack for locating the pulse of a scene, and he’s good with actors – Sarah Polley, as a chicklet set up by a narc, is especially tart. But finally, there’s nothing much to this movie except a lot of funky attitude. Marc Savlov&#x27;s review for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; read &quot;Relentless and mercurial, this new outing by &quot;Swingers&quot; director Liman takes off somewhere around Mach 3 and never lets up, leaving you with either a pounding headache or a wicked grin, or perhaps both. Jeff Vice wrote in the &quot;Salt Lake City Journal&quot;, &quot;The idea behind &quot;&quot;Go&quot; — showing the same event through several different perspectives — has been done before, of course — most famously in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.&quot; But there are enough twists and turns this time around to make it worthwhile. But don&#x27;t mistake this ensemble piece for a feel-good comedy. This is very rough stuff, in terms of story and content, which will put off a lot of audience members. And it&#x27;s certainly not socially redeeming in any way. On the online review site &quot;Reel Views&quot;, James Berardinelli called the film &quot; the latest piece of high-octane eye candy aimed squarely at members of the infamous Generation X. Fast-paced and often witty, but ultimately vapid.&quot;

In 2008, Joe Valdez of &quot;The Distracted Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;Few titles have the finesse to sum up a movie as brilliantly as &quot;Go&quot;, a drug fueled rollercoaster ride that alternates between dark comedy and light suspense with terrific verve. The film&#x27;s appeal lies in its modest scale and the fact that it was made mostly by starving artist types. ...Nearly everyone involved in the production was a relative unknown or newcomer. With no pressure to supply an entertainment to the masses, the writer, director and most of the actors deliver the best work of their careers.&quot;

In April 2014, Joe Reid of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; revisited &quot;Go&quot; on the 15th anniversary of its release. Reid noted that at the time it came out, it was seen as a &quot;knock-off&quot; of other 1990s films: 

===Box office===
&quot;Go&quot; grossed $16.9million domestically (United States and Canada), and $11.5million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $28.5million, against a budget of $20million. It spent its first four weeks in the Top10 at the domestic box office.

<doc id="585173" wikidata="Q424083" url="?curid=585173" title="Acoustic phonetics">
<text>Acoustic phonetics is a subfield of phonetics, which deals with acoustic aspects of speech sounds. Acoustic phonetics investigates time domain features such as the mean squared amplitude of a waveform, its duration, its fundamental frequency, or frequency domain features such as the frequency spectrum, or even combined spectrotemporal features and the relationship of these properties to other branches of phonetics (e.g. articulatory or auditory phonetics), and to abstract linguistic concepts such as phonemes, phrases, or utterances.

The study of acoustic phonetics was greatly enhanced in the late 19th century by the invention of the Edison phonograph. The phonograph allowed the speech signal to be recorded and then later processed and analyzed. By replaying the same speech signal from the phonograph several times, filtering it each time with a different band-pass filter, a spectrogram of the speech utterance could be built up. A series of papers by Ludimar Hermann published in Pflügers Archiv in the last two decades of the 19th century investigated the spectral properties of vowels and consonants using the Edison phonograph, and it was in these papers that the term &quot;formant&quot; was first introduced. Hermann also played back vowel recordings made with the Edison phonograph at different speeds to distinguish between Willis&#x27; and Wheatstone&#x27;s theories of vowel production.

Further advances in acoustic phonetics were made possible by the development of the telephone industry. (Incidentally, Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s father, Alexander Melville Bell, was a phonetician.) During World War II, work at the Bell Telephone Laboratories (which invented the spectrograph) greatly facilitated the systematic study of the spectral properties of periodic and aperiodic speech sounds, vocal tract resonances and vowel formants, voice quality, prosody, etc.

Integrated linear prediction residuals (ILPR) was an effective feature proposed by T V Ananthapadmanabha in 1995, which closely approximates the voice source signal. This proved to be very effective in accurate estimation of the epochs or the glottal closure instant. A G Ramakrishnan et al. showed in 2015 that the discrete cosine transform coefficients of the ILPR contains speaker information that supplements the mel frequency cepstral coefficients. Plosion index is another scalar, time-domain feature that was introduced by T V Ananthapadmanabha et al. for characterizing the closure-burst transition of stop consonants.

On a theoretical level, speech acoustics can be modeled in a way analogous to electrical circuits. Lord Rayleigh was among the first to recognize that the new electric theory could be used in acoustics, but it was not until 1941 that the circuit model was effectively used, in a book by Chiba and Kajiyama called &quot;The Vowel: Its Nature and Structure&quot;. (This book by Japanese authors working in Japan was published in English at the height of World War II.) In 1952, Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle wrote &quot;Preliminaries to Speech Analysis&quot;, a seminal work tying acoustic phonetics and phonological theory together. This little book was followed in 1960 by Fant &quot;Acoustic Theory of Speech Production&quot;, which has remained the major theoretical foundation for speech acoustic research in both the academy and industry. (Fant was himself very involved in the telephone industry.) Other important framers of the field include Kenneth N. Stevens who wrote &quot;Acoustic Phonetics&quot;, Osamu Fujimura, and Peter Ladefoged.

<doc id="585174" wikidata="Q1397930" url="?curid=585174" title="Companions of Saint Nicholas">
<text>The companions of Saint Nicholas are a group of closely related figures who accompany Saint Nicholas throughout the territories formerly in the Holy Roman Empire or the countries that it influenced culturally. These characters act as a foil to the benevolent Christmas gift-bringer, threatening to thrash or abduct disobedient children. Jacob Grimm (&quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;) associated this character with the pre-Christian house spirit (kobold, elf) which could be benevolent or malicious, but whose mischievous side was emphasized after Christianization. The association of the Christmas gift-bringer with elves has parallels in English and Scandinavian folklore, and is ultimately and remotely connected to the Christmas elf in modern American folklore.

Names for the &quot;dark&quot; or threatening companion figure include: &quot;Knecht Ruprecht&quot; in Germany, &quot;Krampus&quot; in Austria, Bavaria, Parkelj in Slovenia, Friuli, Croatia, Hungary (spelled &quot;Krampusz&quot;);
&quot;Klaubauf&quot; in Bavaria, Austria;
&quot;Bartel&quot; in Styria;
&quot;Pelzebock&quot;;
&quot;Befana&quot;;
&quot;Pelznickel&quot;;
&quot;Belzeniggl&quot;;
&quot;Belsnickel&quot; in the Palatinate (and also Pennsylvania, due to Pennsylvania Dutch influence);
&quot;Schmutzli&quot; in the German-speaking part of Switzerland;
&quot;Rumpelklas&quot;;
&quot;Bellzebub&quot;;
&quot;Hans Muff&quot;;
&quot;Drapp&quot;; and
&quot;Buzebergt&quot; in Augsburg.

The corresponding figure in the Netherlands and Flanders is called &quot;Zwarte Piet&quot; or &quot;Black Pete&quot;, and in Swiss-German folklore &quot;Schmutzli&quot;, ( meaning dirt). In the Czech Republic, Saint Nicholas or &quot;svatý Mikuláš&quot; is accompanied by the &quot;čert&quot; (Devil) and &quot;anděl&quot; (Angel). In France, Saint Nicholas&#x27; companion is called &quot;Rubbels&quot; in German-speaking Lorraine and &quot;Hanstrapp&quot; in Alsace, East of France and the &quot;Père Fouettard&quot; (Wallonia, Northern and Eastern France).

Often the subject of winter poems and tales, the Companions travel with Saint Nicholas carrying with them a rod (sometimes a stick and in modern times often a broom) and a sack. They are sometimes dressed in black rags, bearing a black face and unruly black hair. In many contemporary portrayals the companions look like dark, sinister, or rustic versions of Nicholas himself, with a similar costume but with a darker color scheme.

=== Knecht Ruprecht ===
In the folklore of Germany, Knecht Ruprecht, which translates as &quot;Farmhand Rupert&quot; or &quot;Servant Rupert&quot;, is a companion of Saint Nicholas, and possibly the most familiar. Tradition holds that he was a man with a long beard, wearing fur or covered in pea-straw. Knecht Ruprecht sometimes carried a long staff and a bag of ashes, and wore little bells on his clothes.

According to tradition, Knecht Ruprecht asks children whether they know their prayers. If they do, they receive apples, nuts, and gingerbread. If they do not, he beats the children with his bag of ashes. In other (presumably more modern) versions of the story, Knecht Ruprecht gives naughty children gifts such as lumps of coal, sticks, and stones, while well-behaving children receive sweets from Saint Nicholas. He also can be known to give naughty children a switch (stick) in their shoes instead of candy, fruit and nuts, in the German tradition.

&quot;Ruprecht&quot; was a common name for the devil in Germany and Grimm states that &quot;Robin fellow is the same home-sprite whom we in Germany call Knecht Ruprecht and exhibit to children at Christmas...&quot; Knecht Ruprecht first appears in written sources in the 17th century, as a figure in a Nuremberg Christmas procession.

According to Alexander Tille, Knecht Ruprecht represented an archetypal manservant, &quot;and has exactly as much individuality of social rank and as little personal individuality as the &quot;Junker Hanns&quot; and the &quot;Bauer Michel&quot;, the characters representative of country nobility and peasantry respectively.&quot; Tille also states that Knecht Ruprecht originally had no connection with Christmastime.

Ruprecht sometimes walks with a limp, because of a childhood injury. Often, his black clothes and dirty face are attributed to the soot he collects as he goes down chimneys. In some of the Ruprecht traditions, the children would be summoned to the door to perform tricks, such as a dance or singing a song to impress upon Santa and Ruprecht that they were indeed good children. Those who performed badly would be beaten soundly by Servant Ruprecht, and those who performed well were given a gift or some treats. Those who performed badly enough or had committed other misdeeds throughout the year were put into Ruprecht&#x27;s sack and taken away, variously to Ruprecht&#x27;s home in the Black Forest to be consumed later, or to be tossed into a river. In other versions the children must be asleep, and would awake to find their shoes filled with either sweets, coal, or in some cases a stick.

=== Krampus ===

&quot;Krampus&quot; is a terrifying figure found in parts of Austria, Bavaria, South Tyrol, Slovenia, and Croatia, most probably originating in the Pre-Christian Alpine traditions. In Tyrol, he is also called &quot;Tuifl&quot;.

The Feast of Saint Nicholas is celebrated in parts of Europe on December 6. On the preceding evening, &quot;&quot;, the wicked hairy devil appears on the streets. He sometimes accompanies St. Nicholas. However, Krampus will at times be on his own, visiting homes and businesses. Saint Nicholas dispenses gifts, while Krampus supplies coal and bundles of birch branches.

Europeans have been exchanging &quot;Krampuskarten&quot;, greeting cards featuring Krampus, since the 1800s. A &quot;Krampuslauf&quot; is a run of celebrants dressed as the beast, and is still quite popular, many of the participants fortified with &quot;schnapps&quot;. Over 1200 &quot;Krampus&quot; gather in Schladming, Styria from all over Austria wearing goat-hair costumes and carved masks, carrying bundles of sticks used as switches and swinging cowbells to warn of their approach. In the past few decades village Krampus associations parade without St. Nicholas at Krampus events throughout late November and early December.

In 2011, National Public Radio helped advertise the formation of a &quot;Krampuslauf&quot; by Krampus enthusiasts in Philadelphia.

=== Belsnickel ===

Belsnickel is a companion of Saint Nicholas in the Palatinate (Pfalz), Germany. Belsnickel is a man wearing fur which covers his entire body, and he sometimes wears a mask with a long tongue. He is a rather scary creature who visits children at Christmas time and delivers socks or shoes full of candy, but if the children were not good, they will find coal in their stockings instead.

In parts of the United States in the 19th century, &quot;Pelznickel&quot; traditions were maintained for a time among immigrants at least as far west as the US state of Indiana. Today, remnants of this tradition remain, known as the &quot;Belsnickel&quot;, especially in Pennsylvania.

A first-hand 19th-century account of the &quot;Beltznickle&quot; tradition in Allegany County, Maryland, can be found in &quot;Brown&#x27;s Miscellaneous Writings&quot;, a collection of essays by Jacob Brown (born 1824). Writing of a period around 1830, Brown says, &quot;we did not hear of&quot; Santa Claus. Instead, the tradition called for a visit by a different character altogether:

On the South Shore of Nova Scotia, Canada, a Christmas tradition known as Belsnickling occurs, where, similar to mummering, people go from house to house within the communities dressed in multiple layers of clothing and with scarves around their faces to conceal their identity. These people are then given food and drinks (usually rum or eggnog) until their identities are guessed, and then they&#x27;re off to the next house.

=== Zwarte Piet (Black Pete) ===

&quot;Zwarte Piet&quot; (, , meaning father whipper) is the companion of Saint Nicholas () in the folklore of the Low Countries. The character first appeared in his current form in an 1850 book by Jan Schenkman and is commonly depicted as a blackamoor. Traditionally Zwarte Piet is said to be black because he is a Moor from Spain. Participants portraying Zwarte Piet typically wear blackface make-up, by painting their faces black, wearing exaggerated red lipstick, and a &quot;nappy&quot; or &quot;kinky&quot; wig, as well as colorful Renaissance attire and gold earrings. The character has become a reoccurring subject of controversy, especially in the Netherlands, for its perceived cultural and ethnic insensitivity. Historically, Zwarte Piet is referred to as a servant, not a companion.

Like Knecht Ruprecht, he was traditionally the one punishing ill-behaved children by beating them with a birch rod or even taking them back to Spain in a sack he carried (which on arrival contained the gifts for the good children). However, in the 20th century these punishments were abolished and Zwarte Piet became a friendly character, although the punishments can still be heard in Sinterklaas songs.

<doc id="585175" wikidata="Q296386" url="?curid=585175" title="Michel Debré">
<text>Michel Jean-Pierre Debré (; 15 January 1912 – 2 August 1996) was the first Prime Minister of the French Fifth Republic. He is considered the &quot;father&quot; of the current Constitution of France. He served under President Charles de Gaulle from 1959 to 1962. In terms of political personality, Debré was intense and immovable and had a tendency to rhetorical extremism.

==Early life==
Debré was born in Paris, the son of Jeanne-Marguerite (Debat-Ponsan) and Robert Debré, a well-known professor of medicine, who is today considered by many to be the founder of modern pediatrics. His maternal grandfather was academic painter Édouard Debat-Ponsan. Debré&#x27;s father was Jewish, and his grandfather was a rabbi. Debré himself was Roman Catholic.

He studied at the Lycée Montaigne and then at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, obtained a diploma from the École Libre des Sciences Politiques, and a PhD in Law from the University of Paris. He then became a Professor of Law at the University of Paris. He also joined the École des Officiers de Réserve de la Cavalerie (Reserve Cavalry-Officers School) in Saumur. In 1934, at the age of twenty-two, Debré passed the entrance exam and became a member of the Conseil d&#x27;État. In 1938, he joined the staff of the Economy Minister Paul Reynaud.

==Early career==
In 1939, at the beginning of the Second World War, Debré was enlisted as a cavalry officer. He was taken prisoner in Artenay in June 1940 during the Battle of France but managed to escape in September. He returned to the Conseil d&#x27;État, now under the administration of the Vichy regime and was sworn in by Marshal Philippe Pétain. In 1942, he was promoted to &quot;maître des requêtes&quot; by the Minister of Justice. After the German invasion of the free zone in November 1942, Debré&#x27;s political Pétainism disappeared, and in February 1943, he became involved in the French Resistance by joining the network Ceux de la Résistance (CDLR).

During the summer of 1943, General Charles de Gaulle gave Debré the task of making a list of prefects who would replace those of the Vichy regime after the Liberation. In August 1944, de Gaulle made him Commissaire de la République for Angers, and in 1945, the Provisional Government charged him with the task of reforming the French Civil Service. While doing so, he created the , a decision rooted in ideas formulated by Jean Zay before the war.

Under the Fourth Republic, Debré at first supported the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance but defected to the Radical-Socialist Party on the alleged advice de Gaulle, who reportedly told him and several other politicians, including Jacques Chaban-Delmas, &quot;Allez au parti radical. C&#x27;est là que vous trouverez les derniers vestiges du sens de l&#x27;Etat.&quot; (&quot;Go to the Radical Party. It&#x27;s there that you will find the last vestiges of the meaning of the state&quot;.)

Debré then joined the Rally of the French People and was elected senator of Indre-et-Loire, a position that he held from 1948 to 1958. In 1957, he founded &quot;Le Courrier de la colère&quot;, a newspaper that fiercely defended French Algeria and called for the return to power of de Gaulle. In the 2 December 1957 issue, Debré wrote:
The explicit appeal to the insurgency led the socialist politician Alain Savary to write, &quot;In the case of the OAS insurgency, the soldiers are not the culprit; the culprit is Debré&quot;.

==Family==
Michel Debré had four sons: Vincent Debré (1939–), businessman; François Debré (1942–2020), journalist; Bernard Debré (1944–2020), urologist and politician; and Bernard&#x27;s fraternal twin, Jean-Louis Debré, politician. See Debré family.

==Government==

Michel Debré became the Garde des Sceaux and Minister of Justice in the cabinet of General de Gaulle on 1 June 1958. He played an important role in drafting the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, and on its acceptance he took up the new position of Prime Minister of France, which he held from 8 January 1959 to 1962.

After the 1962 Évian Accords referendum that ended the Algerian War and gave self-determination to Algeria was approved by a nearly ten-to-one margin, de Gaulle replaced Debré with Georges Pompidou. In November, during the parliamentary elections that followed the dissolution of the National Assembly, Debré tried to be elected as deputy for Indre-et-Loire. Defeated, in March 1963 he decided to go to Réunion, an island that he had visited for less than 24 hours on 10 July 1959, on a trip with President de Gaulle. The choice reflects Debré&#x27;s fear that what remained of the French colonial empires would follow the path trodden by Algeria: that of independence for which he was not sympathetic.

Debré wanted to take action against the Communist Party of Réunion, which had been founded by Paul Vergès a few years earlier. The movement sought self-determination for the island and the removal of its position as an overseas department and had staged demonstrations on the island a few days earlier. He also noted that the invalidation of Gabriel Macé&#x27;s election as Mayor of Saint-Denis rendered the post open to the opposition and so he took the decision to contest the election.

Debré returned to the government in 1966 as Economy and Finance Minister. After the May 1968 crisis, he became Foreign Minister and, one year later, served as Defence Minister under President Georges Pompidou. In that role, he became a hated figure of the left because of his determination to expropriate the land of 107 peasant farmers and shepherds on the Larzac plateau to extend an existing military base. The resulting civil disobedience campaign was ultimately victorious.

Considered as a guardian of the Gaullist orthodoxy, Debré was marginalised after the election of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing as President of France in 1974, whose foreign policy Debré criticised with virulence. In 1979, Debré took a major part in the Rally for the Republic (RPR) campaign against European federalism and was elected member of the European Parliament to defend the principle of the Europe of nations. However, Debré later accused Jacques Chirac, and the RPR moderated their speech. Debré was a dissident candidate in the 1981 presidential election but obtained only 1.6% of votes.

===Politics in Réunion===
Michel Debré arrived on the island of Réunion in April 1963 and succeeded in being elected Député for Saint-Denis on 6 May despite local opposition to the &quot;ordonnance Debré&quot;, a law that he had introduced in 1960 to allow civil servants in the overseas departments and territories of France to be recalled to Metropolitan France if they were suspected of disturbing public order. Supported by those who rejected autonomy, he immediately became the leader of the local right wing. That state of affairs would be challenged by Pierre Lagourgue during the next decade.

To justify the departmentalization of the island that occurred in 1946 and to preserve its inhabitants from the temptation of independence, Debré implemented an economic development policy and opened the island&#x27;s first family planning center. He personally fought to get Paris to create a second secondary school on the south of the island, in Le Tampon, when at the time there was only one, the Lycée Leconte-de-Lisle, which catered for many thousands of inhabitants.

From 1968 to 1982, Debré forcibly relocated over 2,000 children from Réunion to France, to work as free labour in Creuse. The plight of those children, known as the Children of Creuse, was brought to light in 2002 when the Réunion exile Jean-Jacques Martial made a legal complaint against Debré, who had organised the controversial displacement, for &quot;kidnapping of a minor, roundup and deportation&quot;. In 2005, a similar case was brought against the French Government by the Association of Réunion of Creuse.

<text>Herbert Joseph Sendek Jr. (born February 22, 1963) is an American college basketball coach who is the current men&#x27;s basketball head coach at Santa Clara.

==Early life==
Herbert Joseph Sendek Jr. of Slovak descent, grew up in Pittsburgh and attended Penn Hills High School. He starred as a point guard in basketball, lettering two years, serving as team captain, and earning All-East Suburban honors. He graduated with a perfect 4.0 grade-point average and was valedictorian of the Class of 1981. Sendek&#x27;s father, Herb Sr., was a teacher and basketball coach at both the high school and junior college levels.

==College career==
He played college basketball at Carnegie Mellon University, where he was a three-year letterman. He graduated summa cum laude in 1985 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in industrial management and earned the Carnegie Merit Scholarship.

==Assistant coach==
In 1984–85, Sendek served as an assistant coach at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh.

Sendek served as a graduate assistant coach at Providence in 1985, then as an assistant coach at Providence from 1987 to 1989. He then served as an assistant coach at Kentucky under Rick Pitino from 1989 to 1993.

==Head coach==

===Miami (Ohio)===
In 1993, Sendek accepted his first college head coaching job, at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, succeeding Joby Wright, who left to become head coach at Wyoming. In his first season, 1993–94, the Redskins (now RedHawks) posted a 19–11 record and finished second in the Mid-American Conference (MAC).

In 1994–95, Miami improved to 23–7 overall, winning the MAC championship with a 16–2 record and earning a spot in the NCAA tournament. In the Midwest Regional, #12 seeded Miami shocked #5 seeded Arizona 71–62, before losing to #4 seeded Virginia in overtime in the second round.

In Sendek&#x27;s third season at Miami, 1995–96, the team went 21–8 and finished third in the MAC. Miami earned a berth in the NIT, losing a first-round game to Fresno State, 58–57. Sendek was named the 1995 MAC Coach of the Year.

===North Carolina State===
After three seasons at Miami, Sendek was hired at North Carolina State in 1996, becoming the youngest head coach in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). He immediately improved upon the Les Robinson era, winning 17 games for the program&#x27;s first winning record in six years. The Wolfpack ended the season winning eight of 11 games, advanced to the finals of the ACC tournament, and earned a trip to the postseason in the NIT.

Sendek coached NC State to the NCAA tournament five consecutive years from 2002 until 2006 (tying the school record). He won his 100th game at NC State in 2002. In 2004, Sendek won ACC Coach of the Year and Julius Hodge, one of Sendek&#x27;s most prized recruits during his NC State tenure, was named ACC Men&#x27;s Basketball Player of the Year. In 2005, NC State upset defending champion Connecticut in the Second Round of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet 16, NC State&#x27;s deepest run into the tournament during Sendek&#x27;s years.

Due in part to an 8–38 record against Duke and North Carolina combined with failing to win an ACC championship, fan and booster support was in steep decline. This ultimately played a factor in Sendek deciding to leave NC State for the head coaching vacancy at Arizona State.

===Arizona State===
On April 3, 2006, Sendek accepted the head coaching job at Arizona State. While his first year record in the Pac-10 was a paltry 2–16, recruiting went well: ASU signed Jerren Shipp, a highly regarded high school guard, point guard Derek Glasser from the LA area, and Eric Boateng, a McDonald&#x27;s All-American who transferred from Duke. His second recruiting class included highly touted McDonald&#x27;s All-American James Harden and point guard Jamelle McMillan (a four-star recruit and the son of former NC State basketball star Nate McMillan).

The 2007–08 season was a great improvement over the previous season. Sendek and freshman guard James Harden led the Sun Devils to fifth place in the Pac-10 Conference, including a sweep of rival Arizona. Arizona State was rewarded with a number 1 seed in the 2008 NIT. The 2008–09 team led by Pac-10 Player of the Year Harden improved to a 25–10 record and advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament.

After the departure of Harden for the NBA, the Sun Devils program finished second in the Pac-10 during the 2009–10 season in what was a weak Pac-10 Conference. That year, the conference RPI was so weak, it was the first time the second-place Pac-10 team did not get an at-large invitation to the NCAA tournament. The Sun Devils instead were given a #1 Seed in the NIT and lost 67–66 to Jacksonville in Tempe. With three returning seniors, there were high expectations for the 2010–11 season with an expected run at the Pac-10 title again. However, the Sun Devils finished in last place with a record of 12–19 (4–14).

The 2011–12 season was anticipated to be better with the addition of newcomer and 2010–11 Arizona High School Player of the Year Jahii Carson. However, Carson failed to gain NCAA clearance to play. The season became even more troublesome as Sendek dismissed his leading scorer, Keala King, from the team on January 7, 2012, for undisclosed reasons. The season resulted in a tenth-place finish in the new Pac-12. A sixth-place finish followed in 2012–13 with a trip to the NIT. In 2013–14, ASU finished with a 21–12 record and a loss in the second round of the NCAA tournament.

On March 24, 2015, Sendek was fired by Arizona State after an 18–16 record, losing to USC in the Pac-12 tournament, and a trip to the NIT.

===Santa Clara===
On March 28, 2016, Sendek accepted the head coaching job at Santa Clara, replacing recently fired coach Kerry Keating, who was fired after nine years.
On January 12, 2022, Sendek got his 500th career win against Pacific.

==Personal life==
Sendek is married to Melanie (Scheuer); they have three daughters.

Sendek was inducted into the Penn Hills Hall of Fame and into the East Boros Chapter of the Pennsylvania Hall of Fame.

<text>Pierre Eugène Jean Pflimlin (; 5 February 1907 – 27 June 2000) was a French Christian Democrat politician who served as the Prime Minister of the Fourth Republic for a few weeks in 1958, before being replaced by Charles de Gaulle during the crisis of that year.

==Life==
Pflimlin was born in Roubaix in the Nord department. A lawyer and a member of the Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP), he was elected deputy of département Bas Rhin in 1945. With his personal roots in Alsace, Pflimlin numbered among his MRP party colleagues the Luxembourg-born Robert Schuman; for both, relations with Germany played an important role in their political thinking.

He held some governmental offices during the Fourth Republic, notably as Minister of Agriculture (1947–1949 and 1950–1951) and as Minister of Economy and Finance (1955–1956, 1957–1958).

===Prime Minister of France===
On 13 May 1958, the French National Assembly approved his nomination as Prime Minister. But the same day, riots took place in Algiers. The French generals in Algeria feared he would arrange for a negotiated solution with the Algerian nationalists giving them control of Algeria. They refused to recognize his cabinet. At this point the leading politicians deserted him, including Guy Mollet, Vincent Auriol, and Antoine Pinay. The crisis culminated in a coup d&#x27;état in Algiers that was resolved with his resignation, thus facilitating Charles de Gaulle accession to the post of Prime Minister on 1 June.

===Subsequent public offices===
Pflimlin was Minister of State until 1959. As Minister of Cooperation in 1962, he resigned with the other MRP ministers in order to protest against the euro-scepticism of de Gaulle.

Pflimlin served as the first Catholic mayor of Strasbourg from 1959 to 1983.

He also was the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1963 to 1966 and President of the European Parliament from 1984 to 1987.

==Honors==
The Pierre Pflimlin bridge over the Rhine south of Strasbourg, connecting France to Germany, is named after him and was opened in 2002.

<doc id="585182" wikidata="Q365413" url="?curid=585182" title="Félix Gaillard">
<text>Félix Gaillard d&#x27;Aimé (; 
5 November 1919 – 10 July 1970) was a French Radical politician who served as Prime Minister under the Fourth Republic from 1957 to 1958. He was the youngest head of a French government since Napoleon.

==Career==
A senior civil servant in the Inland Revenue Service, Gaillard joined the Resistance and served on its Finance committee. As a member of the Radical Party, he was elected deputy of Charente &quot;département&quot; in 1946. During the Fourth Republic, he held a number of governmental offices, notably as Minister of Economy and Finance in 1957.

==Prime minister==

He became Prime Minister in 1957, but, not unusually for the French Fourth Republic; his term of office lasted only a few months. Gaillard was defeated in a vote of no confidence by the French National Assembly, in March 1958, after the bombing of Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef, a Tunisian village.

==Later political career==

President of the Radical Party from 1958 to 1961, he advocated an alliance of the center-left and the center-right parties. He represented a generation of young politicians whose careers were blighted by the advent of the Fifth Republic.

==Death==
Gaillard was last seen alive on 9 July 1970, when he and three passengers boarded his yacht, the &quot;Marie Grillon&quot; and departed the island of Jersey to return to the French mainland after a brief stay. The next day, bits of the wreckage of the yacht were found at the Minquiers reefs, along with the bodies of the two passengers. Gaillard&#x27;s body was found, along with that of another passenger, floating in the English Channel on 12 July.

<doc id="585185" wikidata="Q911173" url="?curid=585185" title="Chemical Abstracts Service">
<text>Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) is a division of the American Chemical Society. It is a source of chemical information and is located in Columbus, Ohio, United States.

==Print periodicals==

Chemical Abstracts is a periodical index that provides numerous tools such as SciFinder as well as tagged keywords, summaries, indexes of disclosures, and structures of compounds in recently published scientific documents. Approximately 8,000 journals, technical reports, dissertations, conference proceedings, and new books, available in at least 50 different languages, are monitored yearly, as are patent specifications from 27 countries and two international organizations. &quot;Chemical Abstracts&quot; ceased print publication on January 1, 2010.

==Databases==
The two principal databases that support the different products are CAplus and Registry.

===CAS References===
CAS References consists of bibliographic information and abstracts for all articles in chemical journals worldwide, and chemistry-related articles from all scientific journals, patents, and other scientific publications.

===Registry===
, the CAS Registry contains information on more than 200 million organic and inorganic substances, and about 70 million protein and nucleic acid sequences. The sequence information comes from CAS and GenBank, produced by the National Institutes of Health. The chemical information is produced by CAS, and is prepared by the CAS Registry System, which identifies each compound with a specific CAS registry number, index name, and graphic representation of its chemical structure.

The assignment of chemical names is done according to the chemical nomenclature rules for &quot;CA&quot; index names, which is slightly different from the internationally standard IUPAC names, according to the rules of IUPAC.

==Products==
CAS databases are available via two principal database systems, STN, and SciFinder.

===STN===

STN (Scientific &amp; Technical Information Network) International is operated jointly by CAS and FIZ Karlsruhe, and is intended primarily for information professionals, using a command language interface. In addition to CAS databases, STN also provides access to many other databases, similar to Dialog.

===SciFinder===
SciFinder is a database of chemical and bibliographic information. Originally it was available only as a client application (for both Windows and MacOS operating systems), a web version was released in 2008. By that time it had a graphical interface, and was able to do graphical searches for chemical structures and reactions (the first database to allow such functions), as well as keyword searches for literature in chemistry and related disciplines. SciFinder Scholar was a very similar a product developed for academic institutions, but discontinued in 2023.
In 2017 the ACS released SciFinder-n as a web-only product with the same data content and improved user interface and search functions. 

SciFinder is considered as the best source of chemical information worldwide, with substantially larger number of relevant information sources than Web of Science or Scopus with Reaxys. However, due to its unique and unusual search functions, substantial training is needed in order to fully take advantage of SciFinder capabilities.

===CASSI===
&quot;CASSI&quot; stands for &quot;Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index&quot;. Since 2009, this formerly print and CD-ROM compilation is available as a free online resource to look up and confirm publication information. The online CASSI Search Tool provides titles and abbreviations, CODEN, ISSN, publisher, and date of first issue (history) for a selected journal. Also included is its language of text and language of summaries.

The range is from 1907 to the present, including both serial and non-serial scientific and technical publications. The database is updated quarterly. &quot;Beyond CASSI&quot; lists abbreviated journal titles from early chemical literature and other historical reference sources.

== History ==
&quot;Chemical Abstracts&quot; (&quot;CA&quot;) began as a volunteer effort and developed from there. The use of volunteer abstractors was phased out in 1994. &quot;Chemical Abstracts&quot; has been associated with the American Chemical Society in one way or another since 1907.

For many years, beginning in 1909, the offices of &quot;Chemical Abstracts&quot; were housed in various places on the Columbus, Ohio campus of Ohio State University, including McPherson Laboratory and Watts Hall. In 1965, CAS moved to a new site on the west bank of the Olentangy River, just north of The Ohio State campus. This campus became well known in the Columbus area and famous as the site of many Columbus Symphony Orchestra pop concerts. In 2009, the campus consisted of three buildings.

In 1907, William A. Noyes had enlarged the &quot;Review of American Chemical Research&quot;, an abstracting publication begun by Arthur Noyes in 1895 that was the forerunner of &quot;Chemical Abstracts&quot;. When it became evident that a separate publication containing these abstracts was needed, Noyes became the first editor of the new publication, &quot;Chemical Abstracts&quot;.

E. J. Crane became the first Director of Chemical Abstracts Service when it became an American Chemical Society division in 1956. Crane had been &quot;CA&quot; editor since 1915, and his dedication was a key factor in its long-term success.

Dale B. Baker became the CAS Director upon Crane&#x27;s retirement in 1958. According to CAS, his visionary view of CAS&#x27; potential &quot;led to expansion, modernization, and the forging of international alliances with other information organizations.&quot; CAS was an early leader in the use of computer technology to organize and disseminate information.

The CAS Chemical Registry System was introduced in 1965. CAS developed a unique registry number to identify chemical substances. Agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and local fire departments around the world now rely on these numbers for the definite identification of substances. According to the ACS, this is the largest chemical substance database in the world.

In 1965, CAS left their offices at OSU for a new headquarters north of campus. Ground was broken in 1971 for an expansion to the building designed by architects Brubaker/Brandt to accommodate the review of 400,000 new research reports printed each year. The 5-story 142,000 square foot building opened in May 1973.

In 2007, the ACS designated its Chemical Abstracts Service subdivision an ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of its significance as a comprehensive repository of research in chemistry and related sciences.

In 2021, CAS rebranded along with a change in logo. The organization updated their mission to be more focused on dynamic responsiveness due to ongoing changes within scientific industries and communities.

In 2022, CAS announced the release of almost half a million CAS registry numbers under an open license in their Common Chemistry project.

<text>Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury (19 August 1914 – 10 February 1993) was a French statesman and a member of the Companions of the Liberation. He served as President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) under the Fourth French Republic.

== Early life and education ==
Maurice Jean-Marie Bourgès was born in Luisant, Eure-et-Loir. His father, Georges Bourgès, was a maritime engineering executive, and his mother, Geneviève Maunoury, belonged to a family with a notable political legacy. His maternal grandfather, Maurice Maunoury, was a minister during the French Third Republic, and his great-grandfather, Pol Maunoury, served as a deputy for Eure-et-Loir.

Bourgès-Maunoury attended the prestigious École Polytechnique (class of 1935), obtained a law degree, and graduated from Sciences Po.

== Political career ==

=== Early political engagement ===
Before World War II, Bourgès-Maunoury aligned with the Young Turk faction within the Radical Socialist Party, which represented the left wing of the party. From 1935 to 1940, he served as an artillery officer.

=== Role in the Resistance ===
During the war, Bourgès-Maunoury joined the French Resistance, working with the &quot;X-Libre&quot; network alongside figures like Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Félix Gaillard. On 2 September 1944, he was wounded during a strafing attack on his train in Broye. For his service, he was awarded the Companion of the Liberation by General Charles de Gaulle. In 1945, he was appointed Commissioner of the Republic in Bordeaux.

=== Ministerial roles ===
Bourgès-Maunoury held numerous government positions during the Fourth Republic. These included Minister of National Defence (1956–1957), where he supported a military solution to the Algerian War and opposed the withdrawal from Port Said following the Suez Crisis. As Minister of the Interior (1957–1958), he faced significant unrest, including protests by police officers outside the Palais Bourbon in March 1958.

As President of the Council of Ministers from June to November 1957, Bourgès-Maunoury secured the ratification of the Treaty of Rome, establishing the European Economic Community.

=== Cooperation with Israel ===
Bourgès-Maunoury played a key role in fostering cooperation between France and Israel during the 1950s. Working with Shimon Peres, then Director-General of Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Defense, he facilitated the acquisition of the first Dimona nuclear reactor and military equipment, including the Dassault Mystère IV fighter jet.

=== Opposition to the Fifth Republic ===
Bourgès-Maunoury opposed the return of General de Gaulle to power and campaigned against the Constitution of the Fifth Republic. He unsuccessfully ran for the National Assembly for Landes in 1973.

== Personal life ==
Bourgès-Maunoury married twice. His first marriage to Madeleine Giraud resulted in two sons, Jacques and Marc. His second marriage to Jacqueline Lacoste produced a daughter, Florence-Emmanuelle.

== Honors and distinctions ==
* Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur
* Companion of the Liberation (decree of 12 September 1944)
* Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 (with two citations)
* Médaille de la Résistance with rosette (3 August 1946)
* Distinguished Service Order (UK)
* Legion of Merit (USA)

<text>USA Ultimate is a not-for-profit organization that serves as the governing body of the sport of ultimate (also known as &quot;ultimate Frisbee&quot;) in the United States.

It was founded in 1979 as the Ultimate Players Association, but rebranded itself as USA Ultimate on May 25, 2010. The United States Olympic Committee, empowered to govern amateur sport in the USA per the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act of 1978, officially recognized USA Ultimate as a Recognized Sport Organization on June 10, 2014.

==Overview==
Its mission is &quot;to advance the sport of Ultimate in the United States by enhancing and promoting Character, Community, and Competition.&quot; Its vision is that &quot;Ultimate is widely known, played, and respected in the United States as a sport that inspires athletic excellence and integrity among participants and fans.&quot;

In addition to organizing and supporting national teams to represent the nation in international and world championship competitions, a major focus of USA Ultimate is the Championship Series; it sanctions certain tournaments throughout the year in five divisions (Club, College, Youth, Masters, Beach) and runs the local, regional and/or national championship tournaments at the end of the respective seasons. These events are governed by the 11th Edition Rules. While the national champion is crowned in various divisions of the USA Ultimate Championships, four Canadian teams have won championships over the years in different divisions- Vancouver&#x27;s Furious George (Club Open), University of British Columbia (College Women&#x27;s), Stick Dog (Masters Women&#x27;s), and Winnipeg&#x27;s MOFO (Youth Club Mixed).

In 2008, the 40th Anniversary of the birth of ultimate, USA Ultimate adopted a Five Year Strategic Plan with input from ultimate players throughout the United States, in hopes of facilitating the growth and evolution of the sport for the next forty years.

===Club Competition===
The Club division is currently the only competition division that is not restricted by age (like Youth and Masters) nor school enrollment (like High School and College), but is rather subdivided only by gender into Men&#x27;s (open to any gender and previously called &quot;Open&quot;), Women&#x27;s, and Mixed (with prescribed gender ratios) gender divisions, which have their regular seasons in the summer and their post-season championship series in the fall. The first national championship took place in 1979 in State College, Pennsylvania. The Women&#x27;s division was added in 1981. The age-based Masters Open (now Men&#x27;s) and Women&#x27;s divisions were added to the Club division in 1991; the Masters Women&#x27;s division was discontinued in 1997, and the Masters Men&#x27;s division joined Grandmasters in a separate summer Masters Division in 2012. The Mixed Division was added in 1998. Club national championship tournaments were held in Sarasota, FL from 2000 through 2012, and in 2013 USA Ultimate began moving around the location, starting with Frisco, TX for 3 years and then Rockford, IL in 2016. The event returned to Sarasota, FL in 2017, followed by San Diego, CA in 2018 and 2019.

The Triple Crown Tour was established in 2013. The three achievements are: winning the US Open tournament, winning the Pro Flight Finale and winning the national championship. Previously, finishing the regular season with a #1 season ranking replaced the Pro Flight Finale component. San Francisco&#x27;s Revolver in the men&#x27;s division and Seattle&#x27;s Mixtape in the mixed division won all three achievements in 2013 and 2017, respectively.

===College Competition===
The College division is subdivided into Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s (open to any gender and previously called &quot;Open&quot; despite the vast majority of participants identifying as men) gender divisions, which have their regular season in the winter and spring. Over 300 Open teams and 200 Women&#x27;s teams took part in the College Championship Series in 2005. The College Open division was first held in 1984 in Somerville, MA and was won by Stanford University. The College Women&#x27;s Division was added in 1987. In fall 2017, USAU added mixed regional tournaments with 5 regions. In 2018, another region was added for a total of 6 regional championship events.

===Youth Competition===
Originally, the National Youth championship was loosely a high school-based competition, with guidelines determining how many players must be from one high school. In the early 21st century, USA Ultimate moved more towards a complete high school nationals, which launched in 1998 in Maplewood, NJ.

In 2005, two significant changes were made: High School Nationals was split into Easterns and Westerns, split by the Mississippi River, held in May each year, and a Youth Club Championships was created, for club teams assembled from various cities/regions across North America, held in August each year at the National Sports Center. Over 24 states currently hold high school ultimate state championship tournaments that are operated by local USA Ultimate Competition State Youth Coordinator volunteer staff.

===Masters Competition===
The Masters division currently consists of Masters Men, Masters Women and Grandmasters Men&#x27;s divisions. In 2017, USA Ultimate added Masters Mixed, Grandmasters Women, and Great Grandmasters Men&#x27;s divisions. To compete in the single gender or the mixed division Masters division, men must be 33 years old and women must be 30 years old. To compete in the Grandmasters division, men must be 40 years old and women must be 37 years old. To compete in the Great Grandmasters division, men must be 50 years old and women must be 45 years or older. Regional championships are played in the early to mid summer with the national championship occurring in the mid to late summer.

===Beach Competition===
The Beach division, played on a smaller sand-covered surface with fewer players per side than the grass format, was officially added by USA Ultimate in May 2015 with the introduction of a national championship tournament in Virginia Beach, VA. The event returned in 2016, and the division added the US Beach Open event in Santa Monica, CA, in November 2016. In 2017, the division will return both of those events as well as a third new Beach Western Championship event in April in Santa Monica, CA. Four geographic regions have been established for the East Coast, Great Lakes, Gulf Coast, and West, each with an assigned resident Regional Director volunteer staff position. However, regional championships have not yet been presented as viable, until the division grows further in size and popularity. Outreach efforts were established to promote the sand format and point out to organizers that existing sand volleyball courts can be used for modified formats in places that are not coastal or accessible to large public areas of natural flat sand, such as coasts and beaches.

===Other programs===
Aside from the championship series, several community development programs exist to advance the sport at local and grassroots levels. Event Sanctioning provides insurance, marketing, exposure, connections to rankings for some competition divisions and discounts on materials for tournaments, leagues and training events (like practices, scrimmages, camps, clinics, etc.). The Affiliate program connects the national office to existing organizations that are dedicated to advancing the sport in a specific metro area. The State-Based Organization initiative funds and supports the establishment of new state-focused governing bodies to assume the role of the national office with a dedicated focus on a single state or perhaps a few contiguous states, where geography and population dynamics warrant the combination. New Start Program Grants are given out quarterly to local ultimate organizers who apply for materials to start brand new ultimate programs.

USA Ultimate is run by a thirteen-person Board of Directors, seven of which are elected by the membership, including three by the elite athlete player segment, five of which are appointed by existing board members, including three which must be independent in connections to the organization, and an ex-officio position for the Chief Executive Officer who is hired by the board and is also head of the staff. Officers are elected by board members on an annual basis. Each appointed and elected director&#x27;s term is three years, rotated such that four seats come up for election each calendar year. The Board is responsible for overseeing the Chief Executive Officer, budgeting, strategic planning, setting organizational policies and serving on various working groups that include Equity &amp; Diversity, Audit &amp; Ethics, Nominating, Investment, Marketing, Strategic Planning, et al.

Nearly 62,000 people joined as members of USA Ultimate in 2019, the largest membership year so far. In 2024, memberships for a single calendar year cost $69 per calendar year for adult and college players, $40 per year for Youth players under 20 years old who have not yet graduated from high school, $25 for non-players (coaches, chaperones, etc), and $18 for local Affiliate recreational participants. Multiyear discounts are available for most levels. A lifetime membership is also available for $999. Membership covers participation at sanctioned and championship events; accident and liability insurance in those events; attendance at USA Ultimate education clinics; certification options at various levels of coaching, tournament directing and officiating (called &quot;observing&quot;); voting in board elections; seeking election to the board of directors; discounts with several partner sponsors; scholarship opportunities; access to the USA Ultimate mobile app to follow events, access the rules, event guides for national championships, and report scores for sanctioned events; access to USA Ultimate electronic newsletters and updates; and discounted USA Ultimate merchandise.

USA Ultimate is a member of the World Flying Disc Federation, the international governing body for flying disc sports. WFDF is a member of the General Association for International Sport Federations (GAISF), The International World Games Association (IWGA), and the International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education (ICSSPE), as well as an officially recognized International Federation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

<text>Canal+ (, meaning &quot;Channel Plus&quot;), also spelt Canal Plus and sometimes abbreviated C+ or Canal, is a French premium television channel owned by Canal+. The channel was launched in November 1984, and broadcasts to Metropolitan France. It broadcasts several kinds of programming, mostly encrypted, but some unencrypted content can be viewed free of charge.

Canal+ was co-founded by André Rousselet and Pierre Lescure. An early pioneer was , who joined in 1986.

==History==

In 1978, six years before Canal&#x27;s launch, Jean Frydman who had the TVCS (Télévision Communication Services) project was planning a project to launch a fourth television channel in France which had its roots from the previous Canal 10 project. Whilst waiting for abling to create an encrypted TV channel, the TVCS project had first planned to produce and broadcast their own programmes during time slots when three French television channels began broadcasting a test card in the night and in the morning. One year later in July 1979, it was announced that the channel had chosen to broadcast the programmes produced by public national television channel and the TVCS company Antenne 2 (now known as France 2) who had broadcast encrypted programmes that were originally intended for businesses or certain professionals.

In March 1984 eight before the official launch, Canal+ started their retransmission tests in the Île-de-France region. Those first broadcasts were scheduled every day from 2 to 6pm and they were consisted of music videos, animated short films and various movie trailers.

Canal+ was launched in November 1984, when there were only three government-owned channels available in France. The company was co-founded by André Rousselet, president of the French multinational advertising company Havas, and Pierre Lescure (born ), who proved very popular with media professionals and politicians. It got off to a slow start, and some politicians, including prime minister Laurent Fabius, railed against the idea of having a commercial TV channel. However, Rousselet was a personal friend of the president, François Mitterrand, and so obtained favourable terms for the setup. Pierre Lescure was director-general at that time. A combination of political connections and clever programming – giving the French public American hit comedies and French drama not available on the government channels – worked and subscriptions soon increased. Government regulations required that the channel give several hours of free programming each day, which was used by Canal+ to promote the subscription service. Its first logo was used from inception until 1995.

The channel initially had to use 45% of its air-time on films, until the film industry pushed back. Sport, interview shows, documentaries, and soft pornography joined films as the main staples of programming at this time. Starting in 1985, Canal+ has had a tradition of showing one pornographic film every month at midnight, generally on the first Saturday of the month. In 1985, the government opened up the market to other private commercial television stations, offering some serious competition. However, aggressive marketing and policies ensured that the company kept growing.

 ( – 29 June 2015) joined in 1986 joining his longtime friend Pierre Lescure. De Greef was first appointed director of production, then head of programmes, and finally as director general (1986–2000). De Greef was later described as a pioneer and visionary, who set the tone and created the &quot;Canal Plus spirit&quot;, which embodied anti-conformism along with edgy satire that became very popular. He created the satirical puppet show &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;Info&quot; and cult talk shows &quot;Nulle part ailleurs&quot;, &quot;Groland&quot;, and &quot;Les Deschiens&quot;.

In 1987, Canal+ went public. By 1989, Canal+ had almost three million subscribers. The company expanded into some European markets, notably Belgium, Spain, and Germany, and started setting up subsidiaries as it developed into Groupe Canal+.

In 1994, Rousselet quit the board, and was replaced by director-general Lescure.

Digital satellite provider CanalSatellite was launched as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canal+ on 6 December 1991. On 27 April 1996, Canal+ received two new sister channels: Canal+ Jaune and Canal+ Bleu. A fourth channel, called Canal+ Vert, came along on 31 August 1998. The channels changed their names to Canal+ Confort (now known as Canal+ Décalé since 2005), Canal+ Cinéma, and Canal+ Sport on 1 November 2003.

In January 2000, the Lagardère Group purchased a major stake in the digital television division. In December 2000, Vivendi acquired Canal+. In 2001, co-founder Alain De Greef was fired from his position as director-general and replaced by Michel Denisot, when the organisation was restructured under the leadership of Jean-Marie Messier, chief executive of Vivendi. Criticism of Vivendi&#x27;s poor share performance since the takeover grew, and in April 2002, De Greef&#x27;s co-founder and CEO Pierre Lescure, clashed with Messier and was fired.

An alternative logo was used between 2006 and 2009.
In September 2005, Canal+, Canal+ Cinéma and Canal+ Sport started broadcasting in the French digital terrestrial television network. The free-to-air parts of Canal+ had already been broadcasting for a few months by then. In August 2008, Canal+ started broadcasting the encrypted parts of its main channel in high-definition in the terrestrial network. Canal+ announced plans to turn off the analogue terrestrial signals by 2010.

In April 2014, Ligue 1, France&#x27;s top association football league, sold broadcast rights for 2016–2020 to Canal+ for 726 million euros.

In July 2024, reports emerged that Vivendi was exploring a potential London Stock Exchange listing for Canal+. In December 2024, Canal+ Group was spun-out as independent company. The channel will leave the terrestrial platform in France in June 2025, alongside Canal+ Cinéma, Canal+ Sport and Planète+, as a result of the cut in its agreement with Arcom to keep its licences afloats as a response to the non-renewal of its free-to-air channel C8 by the Arcom. Only 70,000 subscribers receive Canal+ in terrestrial. From 6 June 2025, France 4 will take over its slot; from that day, the new digital terrestrial channel plan will be introduced.

==Description==
Canal+ broadcasts to Metropolitan France. Its programming is mostly encrypted, but some unencrypted programming can be viewed free of charge. The channel does not broadcast advertising, except when broadcasting on free-to-air slots. Almost all foreign films and series can be viewed either in their original language with French subtitles (on a secondary audio channel) or dubbed in French. All programs are subtitled in French for deaf people and those who struggle with hearing. Some programs also have audio description for those who are visually impaired. 

Canal+ is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative, which promotes and establishes an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface. 

==Encryption==
===Analogue===
Originally, subscribers would be mailed a code to punch in on their decoder&#x27;s control panel to view the encrypted service (using the RITC Discret 1 system); the code would be based upon the decoder&#x27;s serial number (stored in the box&#x27;s ROM). To avoid problems with customer&#x27;s codes being not delivered on time by the postal system, Canal+ would switch to encryption based on a generic key, between the last day of the month (beginning at midnight) and the first Monday of the next month (until 9 AM). During this time, all decoders—even those with lapsed subscriptions—would be able to view the channel. 

However, signal piracy was rampant, especially after the magazine &quot;Radio Plans&quot; printed decoder plans in their December 1984 issue. As a result of this, Canal+ switched to the much stronger Nagravision encryption system beginning in 1992; the Discret system was fully phased out by 1995. The new decoders utilised smart cards, cut into the shape of a key and inserted into the front of the decoder. Different decoders using the D2-MAC standard were also deployed during this time, mostly for cable subscribers. With the launch of CanalSatellite, the Mediaguard encryption system was instituted, created by SECA (Société Européenne de Contrôle d&#x27;Accès), a firm owned by Canal+ and Bertelsmann; Canal+ eventually bought out Bertelsmann&#x27;s stake and rebranded SECA as Canal+ Technologies. This firm was sold by 2003 to Thomson SA. The MediaGuard system&#x27;s use in Britain (by the now defunct OnDigital/ITV Digital) led to hackers in the employ of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s rival encryption company NDS breaking into the MediaGuard system, resulting in new cards being issued to Canal+ subscribers in 2002 and Canal+ starting legal action against Murdoch. The Nagravision system continued in use until 30 November 2011, when all analog television broadcasting in France ceased.

&quot;Les Chaînes Canal+&quot; is the offer name regrouping the premium Canal+-branded channels in France. From 2003 to 2008 it was called &quot;Canal+ Le Bouquet&quot;.

<text>Joseph Laniel (; 12 October 18898 April 1975) was a French conservative politician of the French Fourth Republic, who served as Prime Minister for a year from 1953 to 1954. During the middle of his tenure as Prime Minister Laniel was an unsuccessful candidate for the French Presidency, a post won by René Coty.

== Biography ==
Laniel was born at Vimoutiers in Normandy to a family that ran a successful textile factory.

On 10 July 1940, he voted in favour of granting the cabinet presided by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. However, he later joined the French Resistance and was one of the founders of the National Council of the Resistance (CNR).

Co-founder of the Republican Party of Liberty (PRL), then of the National Center of Independents and Peasants (CNIP), Laniel&#x27;s cabinet was overturned after the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu in Indochina in 1954. He was succeeded by Pierre Mendès France.

During the First Indochina War, France under the Leadership of Laniel seek an armistice that was supported by United Kingdom and other countries.

<text>The prime minister of Abkhazia is the &quot;de facto&quot; head of government of the partially recognized Republic of Abkhazia, that is &quot;de jure&quot; part of Georgia.

==History==

===Government of President Vladislav Ardzinba===

While the presidency was held by one man – Vladislav Ardzinba – from 1994 to 2005, the position of prime minister changed hands a number of times during that time. It was created with the November 1994 adoption of the Constitution of Abkhazia, and Gennady Gagulia was appointed to the position in January 1995.

===Government of President Sergei Bagapsh===

After Sergei Bagapsh succeeded Ardzinba to the presidency in February 2005, he appointed Alexander Ankvab as prime minister. Ankvab was Bagapsh&#x27;s vice presidential candidate in the 12 December 2009 presidential election, and as required by law, he was officially suspended from his post on 11 November and his duties were carried out by First Vice Premier Leonid Lakerbaia. Bagapsh and Ankvab won the election, and on 13 February 2010, Ankvab was succeeded by long-time minister for foreign affairs Sergei Shamba.

===Government of President Alexander Ankvab===

After Alexander Ankvab defeated Sergei Shamba in the 2011 presidential election, Leonid Lakerbaia became prime minister.

On 2 June 2014, Lakerbaia resigned as a result of the Abkhazian Revolution and Vice Premier Vladimir Delba was appointed acting prime minister.

===Government of President Raul Khajimba===
The 2014 presidential election was won by opposition leader Raul Khajimba, who on 29 September 2014 appointed Beslan Butba as the new prime minister. However, there were rumors of Butba&#x27;s resignation almost since the beginning of his term, explained variously by a power struggle between Butba and Khajimba and by Butba&#x27;s supposed bad performance as prime minister. Butba was finally dismissed by President Khajimba on 16 March 2015, and temporarily replaced by First Vice Premier Shamil Adzynba. In a press conference afterwards, Butba said that he had made Khajimba aware of his intention to resign. He claimed that the presidential administration had taken over many of the responsibilities of the prime minister, creating a &#x27;second government&#x27;. On 20 March, Khajimba appointed MP and former United Abkhazia chairman Artur Mikvabia as Butba&#x27;s successor.

Following a pending motion of no-confidence against him, the storming of the Interior Ministry by opposition activists and a failed referendum to bring about an early presidential election, Mikvabia announced his resignation as prime minister on 26 July 2016, accepted on the same day by Khajimba. In an interview with Caucasian Knot, Mikvabia stated that the strong unrest in society was being caused by the government&#x27;s efforts to structurally improve the financial situation of Abkhazia through measures such as the introduction of VAT, that he did not want to work under conditions where society itself hindered development and that he hoped his resignation would defuse tensions. Khajimba again appointed Adzynba as acting prime minister. On 5 August, he appointed newly-appointed presidential administration head Beslan Bartsits as the new prime minister.

<doc id="585213" wikidata="Q314545" url="?curid=585213" title="René Pleven">
<text>René Jean Pleven (; 15 April 190113 January 1993) was a notable political figure of the French Resistance and Fourth Republic. An early associate of Jean Monnet then member of the Free French led by Charles de Gaulle, he took a leading role in colonial and financial matters including the Gaullist takeover of French Equatorial Africa in 1940, the creation of the Caisse Centrale de la France Libre in 1941, the Brazzaville Conference in 1944, and the nationalization of the largest French banks in 1945.

In 1946, Pleven broke with De Gaulle and helped found the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (UDSR), a political party that was meant to be a successor to the wartime Resistance movement. He served as prime minister twice in the early 1950s and is remembered for the Pleven Plan for a European Defence Community, which he proposed in October 1950 in coordination with Monnet.

==Early life==

René Pleven was born in Rennes on 15 April 1901 as the son of a commissioned officer and director of studies at the Special Military School of St. Cyr. After studying law at the University of Paris, he failed the exam for the financial corps of the civil service, so he decided to move to the United States, Canada, and Great Britain to work there. He rose to become a telephone company executive. In 1924, he married Anne Bompard.

==Wartime==

Immediately after the breakout of the Second World War, he was in charge of encouraging the construction of aircraft for the Allies in the United States and of purchasing planes for France. As late as 1939, Pleven stated that &quot;Politics do not interest me,&quot; but then a year later, he joined Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Forces, which resisted the Nazi-allied French Vichy Regime. Pleven suggested a political union between Britain and France, with a unification of sovereignty and defensive forces. The plan, supported by Winston Churchill, Paul Reynaud and Charles de Gaulle was not approved due to the opposition of the French armistice with Germany. Pleven helped rally support for Free France in French Equatorial Africa. Returning to London, where de Gaulle and his forces were exiled, in 1941, he became national commissioner for the economy, finance, the colonies and foreign affairs of the French National Committee. In this role, he presided over a 1944 conference in Brazzaville, which opted for a more liberal policy towards the colonies.

==Postwar years==

After France&#x27;s liberation, he was the Minister of the Economy and Finance in the provisional government. After the war, Pleven was elected a legislator from the Côtes-du-Nord department. In 1946, he broke with Charles de Gaulle and founded the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (UDSR) serving as the party&#x27;s president from 1946 to 1953. The party was positioned between the Radical Socialists and the Socialists, favoring limited industrial nationalization and state controls. He then held several Cabinet posts, most notably Defense Minister from 1949 to 1950. In July 1950 he became the country&#x27;s Prime Minister, as power was shifting to the right. A passionate supporter of European integration, he pushed the ratification of the Schuman Plan for European integration creating the European Coal and Steel Community as Prime Minister. He had to face opposition from both left and right to push it through, but he collected enough votes in parliament by promising to increase farm loans and to lower taxes for low-income groups. After three days and two nights of debate, the treaty was ratified. He served until February 1951 and then again from August 1951 to January 1952, resigning over disagreements about budget deficits.

He then became Defense Minister again. His proposal for a European Defense Community, in which to integrate a re-armed Germany, known as the Pleven Plan, was defeated by the Gaullists, communists, and socialists. He also advocated a hard hand in defending French colonial rule in Indochina. In 1953, he resigned as chairman of the UDSR after his party supported the Vietnam peace talks. Being Minister of Defense from 1952 to 1954, he was responsible when the French lost the Battle of Dien Bien Phu initiating the crumbling of French hegemony in the whole region. In 1957, President René Coty offered him the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but he turned it down. Instead, he became the Fourth Republic&#x27;s last Foreign Minister in 1958.

In 1966, Pleven&#x27;s wife died. He had had two daughters, Françoise and Nicole, with her. From 1969 to 1973, he served as Minister of Justice in the governments of Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Pierre Messmer, signing the pardon of notorious escapee Henri Charrière in 1970. Losing re-election as legislator in 1973, he became president of a regional development council in his native Brittany. He died of heart failure on 13 January 1993 at the age of 91.

<doc id="585226" wikidata="Q631942" url="?curid=585226" title="Cosmography">
<text>The term cosmography has two distinct meanings: traditionally it has been the protoscience of mapping the general features of the cosmos, heaven and Earth; more recently, it has been used to describe the ongoing effort to determine the large-scale features of the observable universe.

Premodern views of cosmography can be traditionally divided into those following the tradition of ancient near eastern cosmology, dominant in the Ancient Near East and in early Greece.

== Traditional usage ==
The 14th-century work &quot;&#x27;Aja&#x27;ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara&#x27;ib al-mawjudat&quot; by Persian physician Zakariya al-Qazwini is considered to be an early work of cosmography. Traditional Hindu, Buddhist and Jain cosmography schematize a universe centered on Mount Meru surrounded by rivers, continents and seas. These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.
In 1551, Martín Cortés de Albacar, from Zaragoza, Spain, published &quot;Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar&quot;. Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.

Peter Heylin&#x27;s 1652 book &quot;Cosmographie&quot; (enlarged from his &quot;Microcosmos&quot; of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and is the first known description of Australia, and among the first of California. The book has four sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on &quot;Terra Incognita&quot;, including Australia, and extending to Utopia, Fairyland, and the &quot;Land of Chivalrie&quot;.

In 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive &quot;Compendious Description of the Whole World&quot;, which also included a chronology of world events from Creation forward. These were all part of a major trend in the European Renaissance to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.

== Modern usage ==
In astrophysics, the term &quot;cosmography&quot; is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale matter distribution and kinematics of the observable universe, dependent on the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric but independent of the temporal dependence of the scale factor on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.
The word was also commonly used by Buckminster Fuller in his lectures.

Using the Tully-Fisher relation on a catalog of 10000 galaxies has allowed the construction of 3D images of the local structure of the cosmos. This led to the identification of a local supercluster named the Laniakea Supercluster.

<doc id="585230" wikidata="Q3068477" url="?curid=585230" title="Swedish iron-ore industry during World War II">
<text>Swedish [[iron ore]] was an important economic and military factor in the European theatre of World War II, as Sweden was the main contributor of iron ore to Nazi Germany. The average percentages by source of Nazi Germany’s iron ore procurement through 1933–43 by source were: Sweden: 43.0 Domestic production (Germany): 28.2 France: 12.9. Within the German military the Navy was most dependent on Swedish steel as an absolute necessity to the German war effort, according to their grand admiral. It has also been argued that the Swedish export helped prolong the war.

Both the Allies and the Axis were keen to gain control of the mining district in northernmost Sweden, surrounding the mining towns of Gällivare and Kiruna. The importance of this issue increased after other sources of iron were cut off from Germany by the Allied naval blockade during the Battle of the Atlantic. Both the planned Anglo-French support of Finland in the Winter War, and the following German occupation of Denmark and Norway during Operation Weserübung were to a large extent motivated by the wish to deny their respective enemies iron critical for wartime production of steel.

Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, was particularly concerned about Swedish exports of iron ore to Germany, and pushed for the British government to take military action to end the trade. From the beginning of the war Churchill tried to persuade his cabinet colleagues to send a British fleet into the Baltic Sea to stop Swedish iron reaching Germany from the two Swedish export ports, Luleå and Oxelösund. The planned incursion was termed Project Catherine and was planned by Admiral of the Fleet William Boyle. However, other events overshadowed the incursion and it was canceled. Later, when the Baltic ports froze over and the Germans began shipping the iron ore from the Norwegian port of Narvik, Churchill pushed for the Royal Navy to mine the west coast of Norway to prevent the Germans travelling inside neutral territorial waters to escape Allied Contraband Control measures.

==Background==
At the outbreak of hostilities on 3 September 1939, Britain and France having vastly more powerful naval forces at their disposal swiftly enacted a repeat of the German naval blockade used to great effect throughout the previous war. Germany, had limited natural resources and was reliant on large scale imports for a wide range of goods and raw materials, including iron ore, a steady supply of which was imperative in the creation of steel to sustain its war effort and general economy.

In the year before the war, Germany received 22 million tons of iron ore from various sources. Although it was able to produce around 10m tons of its own iron ore each year, it was of low grade quality and needed to be mixed with high grade material from other countries such as Sweden, which annually supplied it with 9 million tons: 7 million from Kiruna and Gällivare in Lapland and 2 million from the central Swedish ore fields north-west of Stockholm.

With the declaration of war and the start of the blockade, many sources of these foreign supplies were lost to Germany, and although it retained access to 3 million tons per annum from neutral Norway and Luxembourg, the supplies from Morocco and Spain were lost to it, and so the remaining supplies from neutral Scandinavia became of crucial importance. Grand Admiral Raeder, head of the German navy, declared that it would be &quot;utterly impossible to make war should the navy not be able to secure the supplies of iron-ore from Sweden&quot;.

Britain, who itself imported large quantities of iron ore, was fully aware of the Swedish exports to Germany and through its system of Contraband Control was routinely stopping ships of all nations to ensure they were not delivering important supplies to the Germans. To counter the allied blockade, Germany embarked upon a system of unrestricted submarine warfare whereby Allied and neutral ships could be attacked without warning. As a result, during the first nine months of the war a large number of neutral ships were sunk with considerable loss of life by the Germans.

While the Allies were keen to maintain the moral high ground and stressed at every opportunity the difference in impact between their approach compared to their enemy&#x27;s, they were mindful that many neutral mariners (including those of Sweden) relied upon the trade with Nazi Germany for their livelihoods, and so during the opening stages of the war they were careful not to be too strict with non-combatant vessels for fear the blockade would alienate neutral nations into joining the war on the side of Germany.

==Iron ore routes==
There were two main routes by which iron ore was shipped to Germany from Sweden.

===The Eastern Route===

Annually from May to November, ore from the Northern region was shipped from the port of Luleå down the Gulf of Bothnia to the German north Baltic ports at Lübeck, Swinemünde, and Stettin. Outside these months, the Gulf of Bothnia froze over, severely restricting supplies, and although an alternate port was available at Oxelösund, south of Stockholm, for the transport of iron ore from the mines in Bergslagen, this facility was unable to supply the full amount required by Germany, and in any case froze over from January to March each year. Luleå remained outside the reach of Royal Navy&#x27;s patrols but it was estimated that when Luleå and the Baltic ports of Oxelösund and Gävle were open it could only supply around 8m tons, or less than half pre-war imports.

This meant that during the early winter months of the war, due to the thick ice, Germany had no choice other than to transport the majority of its ore by rail to Narvik Station and then by ship along Norway&#x27;s heavily indented Western coast to Germany, a much more circuitous route than the one available during warmer months.

===The Western Route===

The port of Narvik, high above the Arctic Circle was open for iron ore shipments all year round. But the stormy Atlantic coast of Norway also provided another extremely useful geological feature for Germany in its attempts to continue shipping the ore and beating the allied blockade.

Immediately offshore from Norway&#x27;s western coast lies the Skjaergaard (Skjærgård), a continuous chain of some 50,000 glacially formed skerries (small uninhabited islands) sea stacks and rocks running parallel to the shore. A partially hidden sea lane (which Churchill called the Norwegian Corridor) exists in the area between this rocky fringe and the coastal landmass proper. Inside this protected channel it is possible to navigate the entire 1,600 km length of the Norwegian coast from North Cape to Stavanger. Such coastlines, sometimes known as Leadsa rough English translation for the common Norwegian nautical term Ledene (shipping lane) are common around ScandinaviaSkjaergaard also exist along the Swedish and Finnish Baltic coasts and off Greenland.

The Germans made great use of the Norwegian Corridor to avoid the attention of the vigilant Royal Navy and RAF. In the winter of 1939–1940 a steady stream of their specially-constructed iron ore vessels made the long trip south from Narvik, sometimes within the three-mile curtilage of neutral Norwegian territorial waters, sometimes just outside if the way appeared hazardous or the sea particularly turbulent. At the southernmost point the iron ore captains had to make a choice:
# Follow the Skjaergaard around the coasts of Norway and Sweden, down through the Kattegat and finally into the north German and Baltic ports of Lubeck and Stettin. This route was safer because it brought them much closer to the protection of the German naval patrols and Luftwaffe air cover but involved hauling the very bulky and heavy iron ore the long way overland to the industrial centres on the overburdened German railway system.
# Leave the safety of the Skjaergaard and make a dash south across the Skagerrak (the sea channel north of the Danish Jutland peninsula), and hurry down the west coast of Denmark to Hamburg and Bremen. This was the preferred route because it allowed the ore to be taken straight along the efficient inland waterways to the industrial heartlands of the Ruhr and the Rhineland where it could be processed. It was much more hazardous, putting the ships and their cargo at the mercy of allied submarines and patrolling destroyers of the Contraband Control. A number of German ships were sunk in this area.

==British attempts to disrupt trade==
From the beginning of the war, Winston Churchill expended considerable energies trying to persuade his colleagues in the British government to take action to stop the iron ore traffic. On 16 December 1939 he issued a memo to the cabinet:

Although in late 1939 many of Churchill&#x27;s cabinet colleagues agreed with the need to take action to disrupt the iron ore traffic, they decided against the use of mines. At the time negotiations into the British chartering of the entire Norwegian mercantile shipping fleet were at a delicate stage and the British Foreign Office made convincing arguments against infringing upon Norway&#x27;s neutrality. In 1915 the British government had issued an apology to the Norwegian government for a violation of her territorial waters by British warships who seized a German steamer inside the three-mile nautical limit. Near the end of World War I the British, Americans and French had induced the Norwegians to allow the Skjaergaard to be mined in order to prevent German ships and submarines from using their territorial waters as a way around the Great North Sea Mine Barrage, a massive minefield laid from Scotland to Norway as part of the earlier Allied blockade strategy.

Yet another diplomatic dispute over foreign incursions in Norway&#x27;s territorial waters broke out in February 1940 between the respective governments of Britain, Norway and Germany following the &quot;Altmark&quot; Incident. A German tanker carrying British prisoners of war, the &quot;Altmark&quot;, attempting to return home via the cover of the Norwegian Corridor, was spotted by British aircraft on 14 February 1940 and pursued by a British destroyer flotilla, on personal orders from Churchill. On the evening of 16–17 February, a British boarding party from the destroyer &quot;Cossack&quot;, freed 299 British naval prisoners of war from the &quot;Altmark&quot;, which had been seeking safety in Jøssingfjord.

On the evening of 21 March 1940 the British submarine HMS &quot;Ursula&quot;, (which had damaged the German cruiser &quot;Leipzig&quot; in Heligoland Bight the previous December) intercepted the German iron ore ship &quot;Hedderheim&quot;, en route from Narvik, and sank her eight miles off the coast of Denmark, although the crew were all rescued. At the time it was seen as an early indication that Britain was at last taking steps to end the iron trade and over the next few days several other German ships were sunk at the entrance to the Baltic. Following reports that strong British destroyer and submarine forces were stationed in the Skagerrak, Berlin ordered all her ships along the iron ore route to port immediately.

By now it was clear to all concerned that the Phoney War was about to end. Antagonised by the German mining of their own waters with deadly new magnetic mines and a general concern that Germany was managing to overcome the worst effects of the blockade, the Supreme War Council met in London on 28 March 1940 to discuss an intensification of the economic warfare strategy.

Finally, on 3 April the War Cabinet gave authorisation for the mining of the Skjaergaard. On the morning of Monday 8 April 1940 the British informed the Norwegian authorities of its intentions and carried out Operation Wilfred. However, by the time it took place German preparations for the German invasion of Norway were well under way and because of this only one minefield was actually laid, in the mouth of Vestfjord leading directly to Narvik.

==After the invasion of Norway==
Despite warnings from a number of Allied and neutral sources about the imminent invasion, the Norwegians were caught largely unprepared, and on 9 April 1940 the Germans began landing troops in the main Norwegian settlements of Stavanger, Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen and Narvik. The British and French made attempts to assist the Norwegians, landing considerable forces at Narvik on 14 April and fighting fierce naval engagements off the coast. Further Allied landings took place between 18 and 23 April (the Battle of Narvik), but the Germans had already taken too firm a foothold, and the Norwegian government surrendered on 9 June 1940. The railway traversed the significant Norddal Bridge, which was rigged to be blown up in case of war. There was an attempt to blow up this bridge on 14 April, but lack of expertise and of explosives meant that the damages were not so large and it was repaired fairly quickly and was used for ore transport throughout the war.

The production ore in the Kiruna mine declined sharply in 1939 and 1940. The battles of Narvik and the ensuing destruction of much of the port along with the sinking of cargo ships anchored there contributed to this decline. Further, cargo ships leaving Narvik could be sunk by the Allies as Britain had declared iron ore a contraband product. From its height in 1937 to 1940 production of iron ore in Kiruna mine dropped from 7 to 3 million tons.

Soon after the Germans fully occupied Norway they began pressing Sweden to allow unarmed German troops to travel on the Swedish railway system to and from Norway on leave. On 8 July 1940 an agreement on this traffic was reached.

The supplies of iron ore continued to be shipped to Germany, often under Swedish naval protection through the Baltic and in some cases in Swedish transport ships. After the German invasion of Russia, Soviet submarines attempted to sink iron ore ships in the Baltic sea, sinking the Swedish passenger liner, Hansa, on 24 November 1944, causing 84 deaths including children. Transport of ore to Germany through the port of Luleå ended in 1944.

To avoid mass firing as iron ore production declined during the war LKAB workers were kept busy extracting waste rock and some were allowed to retire with pensions before schedule.

== The Swedish position ==
Sweden was able to remain neutral throughout the war. According to Erik Boheman, the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs during the war, the main reasons were luck and the development of the war, in combination with the Swedish people&#x27;s spirit to resist an invasion, and perhaps also some diplomatic skillfulness.

Sweden also sought to maintain its traditional ties with the Western democracies. The Allied blockade of Europe and the German counter blockade of the Baltic prevented all but the bare minimum of commodities such as oil reaching Sweden from the West, but despite the Allies&#x27; sympathy with Sweden&#x27;s position, there was a general belief among the American and British governments that Sweden went too far in collaborating with the Nazi regime.

The Allies noted that without the Swedish iron ore, the German war effort would grind to a halt because not only was the ore being sent in large quantities but it was also of very high quality, making German steel manufacture extremely efficient. The US military was also appalled at Sweden for escorting German ships, allowing use of its own ships to transport the ore and for its failure to stop the transit of German soldiers and war materials across its territory.

After America joined the blockade against the Axis forces and assisted in the economic warfare measures already being implemented by the British in early 1942, efforts were made to stop the Swedish iron ore trade and to reduce the practical help she was giving to Germany, although these attempts initially did nothing to reduce the German war effort.

==Later Allied pressure on Sweden==

During the last half of 1943 and the early months of 1944, the US sought to cripple Germany&#x27;s ability to continue the war by carrying out a concentrated and costly bombing campaign against ball bearing production in Germany combined with trade negotiations, including preclusive purchasing arrangements, intended to cut off Swedish ball bearings to Germany. Despite the bombing, German industrial countermeasures and improvisations warded off any serious consequences, and an Allied agreement with Sweden in September 1943 to halt exports of ball bearings neglected to impose restrictions on exports of the high-quality steel used in their manufacture. This allowed Sweden to continue to provide Germany with ball-bearing steel, largely offsetting the drop in the Swedish export of finished ball bearings.

After the tide of battle on the eastern front had irreversibly shifted following German defeats at El Alemein, Stalingrad and Kursk in the winter and summer of 1943, the Soviet Union, at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers in October 1943, took the lead in suggesting a more active role for Sweden in the War, such as by allowing the establishment of Allied air bases in its territory. Although the Allies decided not to call on Sweden to declare war on Germany, Churchill believed that the War might be brought to an early end if Sweden (and Turkey which provided Germany with chromite ore) entered it on the Allied side in order to confront Hitler on additional fronts.

Although Sweden did not enter the fight, they later agreed to cancel the transit of German military material and troops across Sweden, to further reduce iron ore exports, end Swedish naval escorting of German ships in the Baltic, and reduce ball bearing exports. In exchange, Britain and the US agreed to a relaxation of the blockade to allow Sweden to import certain important commodities, including rubber and oil. The ongoing diplomatic pressure, together with the deteriorating German military position gradually persuaded Sweden to reduce and ultimately end its trade with Germany by November 1944.

==Post-war recovery==
Iron mining in northern Sweden began to recover in the autumn of 1946 with a series of shipments to England. Production was further secured with LKAB signing a contract with Bethlehem Steel the same year. By the early 1950s annual ore production had the same tonnage as in the best years of the 1930s.

<text>André Marie (3 December 1897  – 12 June 1974) was a French Radical politician who served as Prime Minister during the Fourth Republic in 1948.

==Biography==
Born at Honfleur, Calvados, the young André Marie studied at primary and secondary level there, going on to the Lycée Corneille, when his parents moved to Rouen in 1908. While preparing to apply to the École Normale Supérieure Lettres et Sciences Humaines, he was mobilised at the end of 1916. By the end of World War I, he commanded a battery of 75 men. He received two light injuries and numerous commendations. He was decorated with the Croix de guerre with palm.

He started work as a lawyer in 1922. He was elected Deputy for Seine-Inférieure (now Seine-Maritime), holding his seat in the Palais Bourbon from 1928 to 1962. In 1933, André Marie entered the government as Under-Secretary of State to Albert Sarraut, responsible for Alsace-Lorraine. He served in several Under-Secretarial posts, and represented France at the League of Nations.

As World War II escalated, André Marie, a reserve captain, was one of several parliamentarians who enlisted voluntarily. An artillery captain, he was decorated with a second Croix de Guerre, taken prisoner, and imprisoned at the Oflag at Saarburg. He was therefore absent for the vote of 10 July 1940, which empowered Marshal Pétain and instituted the regime of Vichy France.

Marie was freed in 1941, having served as an officer in both World Wars. Refusing Vichy politics on his return to Seine-Maritime, he resigned all his elected offices, and in a letter to his constituents, explained that he could not exercise his mandate while the people could not be consulted freely. As a member of the Georges-France resistance network, he was denounced and arrested on 12 September 1943 by occupation authorities, imprisoned at Compiègne, then deported to a camp at Buchenwald on 16 December 1943, where he remained until the liberation of the camp by American troops on 11 April 1945. He had lost 30 kilograms, and had suffered a heart infection and a liver infection.

On his return to France, André Marie quickly regained his place in political life, both at departmental and national levels.

==Ministerial career==
===Minister of Justice===

In 1947, he was appointed Minister of Justice in the Ramadier ministry, and presided over the last trials in the High Court of collaborators.

===Prime Minister of France===

The President called on him to become Prime Minister, replacing Robert Schuman on 27 July 1948, but he was obliged to resign a month later.

===Subsequent ministerial offices===

He accepted the post of Deputy Prime Minister in the Queuille cabinet in 1948, and was again named Minister of Justice, refusing to pursue the Communists after the miners&#x27; strikes of 1948. On 3 February 1949, as Minister of Justice, he was called to account in the National Assembly on the matter of the economic collaborator Pierre Brice. The radical Deputy Emmanuel d&#x27;Astier de la Vigerie declared: &quot;Men who have amassed fortunes as a result of collaboration are now largely free to enjoy the fruits of their treason because the government, indulgent towards collaborators, has led a politic of repression against the working class.&quot; Weakened by the affair, André Marie resigned on 13 February 1949.

He then served as Minister of Education, from August 1951 until June 1954. He brought about the Marie and Barangé laws, in support of free education. An ardent proponent of public education, he brought about the law, still in place, which makes students of the écoles normales supérieures trainee civil servants: in exchange for a monthly salary, they may be asked to serve the government at any point during the ten years following their matriculation.

==Municipal office==

As Mayor of Barentin from 1945 to 1974, he installed the statues of the town&#x27;s famous &quot;street museum&quot;. He died, aged 76, in Rouen.

<text>Paul Ramadier (17 March 1888 – 14 October 1961) was a French statesman.

== Biography ==
The son of a psychiatrist, Ramadier graduated in law from the University of Toulouse and started his profession as a lawyer in Paris. Then, in 1911, he gained his doctorate in Roman law. He became the mayor of Decazeville in 1919 and served as the first Prime Minister of the Fourth Republic in 1947.

On 10 July 1940, he voted against the granting of the full powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain, who installed the Vichy regime the next day.

Ramadier took part in the Resistance and used the nom de guerre &quot;Violette&quot;. His name was included in the Yad Vashem Jewish memorial after the war.

In the government of Charles de Gaulle (1944–1945), he was Minister for Provisions and earned a reputation as a hardworking, pragmatic and conciliatory politician.

It was during his first ministry that the French Communist Party was forced out of the government in May 1947, which ended the coalition of &quot;tripartisme&quot; with the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO). Ramadier voted for the Marshall Plan.

From 1956 to 1957, Ramadier was Minister of Finance under Guy Mollet.

<text>Matthias Paul (; born 16 December 1971), known professionally as Paul van Dyk () is a German DJ, record producer and musician. Van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release &quot;Reflections&quot;. He was the first DJ to be named number one by &quot;Mixmag&quot; in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide.

A trance producer starting in the early 1990s, van Dyk quickly achieved popularity with his remix of &quot;Love Stimulation&quot; by Humate on the record label MFS in 1993 and with his hit single &quot;For an Angel&quot;. Van Dyk is an avid trance lover to this day. He indicated in an interview that he ended up giving himself the Belgian-sounding stage name because he used to incorporate many Belgian dance records into his DJ sets in the early 1990s.

Van Dyk is currently the host of &quot;Vonyc Sessions with Paul&quot; on Dash Radio.

== Early life and career ==

=== Early life and musical beginning ===
Paul van Dyk grew up in East Berlin in a single parent household; his father left him and his mother when he was four years old. While living there, he worked as a broadcast technician and began training to become a carpenter. Paul van Dyk claims his musical education came from radio. Due to a lack of record stores to buy music from, van Dyk secretly listened to Western radio stations such as Radio in the American Sector and Sender Freies Berlin and mixtapes occasionally smuggled into the country and copied among school friends. The first album he acquired was &quot;Organisation&quot; by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, of which he said, &quot;It was extremely influential. Early electronic, but also melodies and poppy elements, the general imprint of what later came for me in music.&quot;

Shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, van Dyk and his mother were given permission to leave East Germany and moved to Hamburg to live with his aunt. In 1990, van Dyk moved back to Berlin. His first appearance as a DJ was in the club Tresor in March 1991. After several more dates, he was given the chance to perform at Andre&#x27;Hoche&#x27;s Dubmission parties in the Turbine club, together with the young resident DJ Kid Paul. With Cosmic Baby, he collaborated as The Visions of Shiva. Their single &quot;Perfect Day&quot; was released by the Berlin independent label MFS, run by English expatriate producer Mark Reeder and manager Torsten Jurk.

In February 1993, van Dyk and Kid Paul hosted an installment of the weekly three-hour &quot;HR3 Clubnight&quot; radio show, performing for a nationwide audience on German radio. The second and final Visions of Shiva single &quot;How Much Can You Take?&quot; was released, and van Dyk and Cosmic went their separate musical ways. By late summer, Paul released his first DJ-mix compilation &quot;X-Mix-1 – the MFS Trip&quot; and remixed Humate&#x27;s trance hymn &quot;Love Stimulation&quot;.

=== 1994–2007: &quot;45 RPM&quot;, &quot;Seven Ways&quot;, &quot;Out There and Back&quot; and &quot;Reflections&quot; ===
In 1994, van Dyk released &quot;The Green Valley EP&quot;, &quot;Pump This Party&quot; and &quot;Emergency 911&quot;. Meanwhile, MFS acquired many remixes for Paul. MFS label owner Mark Reeder&#x27;s close friendship with artists such as New Order gave van Dyk the opportunity to mix the track &quot;Spooky&quot; from the &quot;Republic&quot; album. He recorded his debut LP &quot;45 RPM&quot; with Johnny Klimek and VOOV.

&quot;Seven Ways&quot; established van Dyk as a trance pioneer and was van Dyk&#x27;s first real success in Britain. &quot;Seven Ways&quot; was voted the No. 1 album by readers of DJ Magazine.

In early 1997, van Dyk began collaborating with U.S. music producer BT. Together, they produced tracks such as &quot;Flaming June&quot;, &quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot; and &quot;Namistai&quot;. The singles &quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Place&quot; did not cause a great impact at first but, with the release of &quot;Seven Ways&quot; and &quot;Words&quot; appearing at the height of the British superclub phenomenon, van Dyk&#x27;s own material began to attract attention. &quot;By the time they realised I was a German, it was too late!&quot; van Dyk said. Van Dyk also remixed a well-known early-1990s track, &quot;The Age of Love&quot;, in 1997.

In 1998, &quot;45 RPM&quot; was re-released in the UK and in the US. To mark the event, and in homage to the defunct E-Werk, van Dyk released a remix of &quot;For An Angel&quot;. Van Dyk took up a residency at Sheffield&#x27;s Gatecrasher and declared himself anti-drugs, which led to home-made &quot;No E, Pure PvD&quot; T-shirts, also a sly note to journalists that his surname contained no &quot;E&quot;. In 1998, Paul remixed Matt Laws/Binary Finary&#x27;s famous &quot;1998&quot; single, which was a successful version that took Binary Finary to the top of the German Dance charts.

In mid-1998, van Dyk left MFS Records and took a controlling share in the new label Vandit Records. In 2000, van Dyk flexed his skills with his melodic, dancefloor-friendly &quot;Out There and Back&quot;, which included the hit single &quot;Tell Me Why (The Riddle)&quot;, a collaboration with Saint Etienne. It also included the European hit &quot;We Are Alive&quot;, a remixed version of the Jennifer Brown song &quot;Alive&quot;. His first mix album &quot;The Politics of Dancing&quot; (2001) was followed by a world tour and a DVD release &quot;Global&quot; (2003) and the Mexican film &quot;Zurdo&quot;, for which van Dyk composed the soundtrack and won a Mexican Oscar for his work.

&quot;Reflections&quot; (2003) inspired by van Dyk&#x27;s trips to India, was a more melancholy affair, and includes the single &quot;Nothing But You&quot;, a collaboration with Hemstock &amp; Jennings. It was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Electronic Album. The same song was also used on the soundtrack of the game FIFA 2004. The mix album &quot;The Politics of Dancing 2&quot; (2005) was preceded by a single &quot;The Other Side,&quot; featuring Wayne Jackson; a song dedicated to the victims, and their families, of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and the subsequent tsunami that struck Thailand on 26 December 2004. His original productions from Reflections have been synced into major motion pictures such as &quot;Into the Blue&quot;, &quot;Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&quot;, television&#x27;s Entertainment Tonight and MTV Cribs, and international ad campaigns for Motorola, HBO, Land Rover, Ski Vail and most recently for Jeep.

=== 2007–2010: &quot;In Between&quot; ===

Van Dyk released his fifth studio album, &quot;In Between&quot;, worldwide on 14 August 2007. The album, which he created over a three-year period, debuted at number No. 115 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Electronic Albums and No. 1 on the Top Heatseekers. The album also reached No. 16 on the Mexican Albums Chart and No. 5 on the Mexican International Chart. The album was released accompanied by a special edition limited to two thousand copies which included a mixed version of the full album, along with an eight-track bonus CD and an eight-page photo anthology.

The album was produced primarily by Paul van Dyk himself, and features a wide range of collaborators including David Byrne of Talking Heads, Jessica Sutta of the Pussycat Dolls, Ashley Tomberlin from Luminary, Alex M.O.R.P.H, Lo Fi Sugar, Rea Garvey of Reamonn, Ryan Merchant and Wayne Jackson. It also features a vocal sample from Ben Lost from Probspot&#x27;s &quot;Blows My Mind&quot; on the song &quot;Another Sunday&quot;. In June 2007, van Dyk embarked on the worldwide &quot;In Between Tour&quot; to promote the album.

Van Dyk&#x27;s work with EA Games has resulted in multiple releases featuring his music in &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot; and &quot;Grand Slam Tennis&quot;. The song was released on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, and helped the album win a Grammy Award that Paul van Dyk shares with his collaborators. He has also remixed Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Martyr&quot;, Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;What Goes Around... Comes Around&quot; and Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Gimme More&quot;.

In May 2008, van Dyk set up a remix competition with digital download network Beatport, inviting aspiring producers to remix his single &#x27;Far Away&#x27; which appeared on his album &quot;In Between&quot;.

On 9 November 2009, van Dyk performed alongside Northern Ireland vocalist Johnny McDaid at the Berlin Wall 20th Anniversary Memorial. They recorded and performed a song for the event called &#x27;We Are One&#x27;.; A dance music event, called &#x27;We Are One Festival&#x27;, was organized at the O2 World Berlin, named after the song he collaborated with Johnny McDaid on for the Berlin Wall Anniversary. Some artists who performed included Armin van Buuren, Underworld and Blueman Group.

In 2010, it was revealed that van Dyk&#x27;s record label Vandit would be merging with Armin van Buuren&#x27;s Armada Music.

=== 2012–2015: &quot;Evolution&quot; and &quot;The Politics of Dancing 3&quot; ===

Van Dyk&#x27;s sixth studio album, titled &quot;Evolution&quot; was released on 3 April 2012.
The track &quot;Eternity&quot; was made in collaboration with Owl City&#x27;s Adam Young.
&quot;Evolution&quot; also features producers Arty, Austin Leeds, Giuseppe Ottaviani and Ummet Ozcan. The album features vocals from Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol, Plumb, Sarah Howells and various other artists.

This release was followed by &quot;The Politics of Dancing 3&quot;, which van Dyk put out on 4 May 2015. With its release, the series, which began in 2001, moved from that of music compilation to artist album. On it, van Dyk worked with artists including Aly &amp; Fila, Giuseppe Ottaviani and others.

=== 2016–present: Fall incident/injuries and &quot;From Then On&quot; ===
On 29 February 2016, during the &quot;A State of Trance&quot; Festival in Utrecht, van Dyk fell through a concealed gap in the stage during his performance, and was transported to a local hospital. Due to a spinal injury and severe brain injury, van Dyk remained under doctors&#x27; supervision at Utrecht Medical Center for weeks. He was cleared for professional medical transfer to a facility in Berlin until mid-May 2016. Numerous performances suffered forced cancellations during this time, including the Electric Daisy Carnival Mexico.

Van Dyk began a light touring schedule mid-June 2016, including &quot;Electric Daisy Carnival&quot; in Las Vegas, Cream at &quot;Amnesia&quot; in Ibiza, and Luminosity Festival in the Netherlands.

Van Dyk&#x27;s accident forced a significant delay in the recording of his eighth studio album. Having continued to convalesce, van Dyk was able to complete the album in the early summer of 2017. &quot;From Then On&quot; was released on 20 October of the same year through his own Vandit label. Subsequently, van Dyk drew on the experiences of the preceding year, which were most clearly evidenced in the track&#x27;s titles. It received positive feedback from the press, with Billboard calling it &quot;a celebration of a beautiful life.&quot; and the website EDMSauce describing it as &quot;near flawless.&quot; Musically the album continued in largely the same artistic vein as &quot;The Politics of Dancing 3&quot; and included collaborations with – amongst others – Alex M.O.R.P.H., M.I.K.E. Push and Jordan Suckley. The lead single &quot;Everyone Needs Love&quot; was released on 23 December 2016, with the final one &quot;Breaking Dawn&quot; arriving 14 months later on 23 February 2018.

In January 2019, van Dyk was awarded $12 million in damages against ALDA, the organizer of the &quot;A State of Trance&quot; event in 2016, in which van Dyk fell on stage and got injured. The court deemed that ALDA had not designed the stage to be safe to stand on, nor had they warned van Dyk that part of the stage was unstable.

On 29 February 2024, van Dyk disclosed on social media that due to the fall incident in 2016, he has suffered life long consequences and he is still not well. He also stated that even though the Nederlands high court had awarded him damages against ALDA, he had not yet been paid anything and that they even tried to stop his insurance from paying him the hospital bills. In responses, ALDA stated that the matter was in the hands of their attorneys and insurance companies.

== Politics ==

Since 2001, van Dyk has taken an interest in politics. His creation of &quot;The Politics of Dancing&quot; compilation was inspired by electronic dance music&#x27;s universal acclaim by different people around the world. &quot;Palestinians are dancing with Israelis. Lebanese people are dancing with Israelis – without war, without anything in their minds other than treating each other respectfully&quot;, said van Dyk in 2006. He also has called EDM &quot;a political and diplomatic tool that could be used.&quot; Having grown up with little freedom, his musical career has helped him voice his opinions about politics. He opposed the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. He describes himself as anti-war and has advertised this while performing, by wearing a shirt reading &quot;Make peace, not war&quot;.

Van Dyk has helped fight poverty by supporting social programs to help disadvantaged people in India, New York, and Berlin. He also participated in Rock the Vote in 2004 and 2008; he and Bono being the only non-American artists to join the campaign encouraging young people to vote.

<text>Félix Gouin (; 5 October 1884 – 25 October 1977) was a French Socialist politician who was a member of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO).

==Personal life==
Félix Gouin was born in Peypin, Bouches-du-Rhône, the son of school teachers. He studied law in Aix-en-Provence.

In 1940 he was among the minority of parliamentarians refusing to grant full powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain.

During the war, he was part of the central committee which reconstituted the Human Rights League and also co-founded the Brutus Network, a Socialist Resistance group.

In 1946, he then succeeded Charles de Gaulle as head of the French Provisional Government. Gouin&#x27;s tenure was arguably most notable for seeing the enactment of France&#x27;s first ever compulsory, amply funded retirement and worker&#x27;s compensation laws. In addition, both the 40-hour law and overtime pay were re-established, while the comites d&#x27;entreprise (works councils) were extended to firms with 50 workers. In April 1946, a statute was adopted by the French Parliament that abolished the colonial legal status of France&#x27;s four oldest colonies: Reunion, Guyane, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. Gouin&#x27;s time in office also witnessed a significant extension of the role of the state in the workings of the French economy, with electricity, gas, coal, and the nine main insurance groups nationalized.

<doc id="585250" wikidata="Q5508943" url="?curid=585250" title="Fundamental Laws of England">
<text>In the 1760s William Blackstone described the Fundamental Laws of England in &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First – Chapter the First : Of the Absolute Rights of Individuals&quot; as &quot;the absolute rights of every Englishman&quot; and traced their basis and evolution as follows:
*&quot;Magna Carta&quot; between King John and his barons in 1215
*confirmation of &quot;Magna Carta&quot; by King Henry III to Parliament in 1216, 1217, and 1225
*&quot;Confirmatio Cartarum&quot; (Confirmation of Charters) 1253
*a multitude of subsequent corroborating statutes, from King Edward I to King Henry IV
*the Petition of Right, a parliamentary declaration in 1628 of the liberties of the people, assented to by King Charles I
*more concessions made by King Charles I to his Parliament
*many laws, particularly the Habeas Corpus Act 1679, passed under King Charles II
*the Bill of Rights 1689 assented to by King William III and Queen Mary II
*the Act of Settlement 1701

Blackstone&#x27;s list was an 18th-century constitutional view, and the Union of the Crowns had occurred in 1603 between Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland, and the 1628 Petition of Right had already referred to the &quot;fundamental laws&quot; being violated.

==Recorded usage==

The phrase &quot;Fundamental Laws of England&quot; has often been used by those opposing particular legislative, royal or religious initiatives.

For example, in 1641 the House of Commons of England protested that the Roman Catholic Church was &quot;subverting the fundamental laws of England and Ireland&quot;, part of a campaign ending in 1649 with the beheading of King Charles I.

Subsequently, the phrase was used by the Leveller Lt. Col. John Lilburne (later to become a Quaker) accusing the House of Lords and House of Commons of tyranny in &quot;The Just Defence of John Lilburne, Against Such as charge him with Turbulency of Spirit&quot;. Lilburne also wrote a 1646 book called &quot;The Legal Fundamental Liberties of the People of England, asserted, revived and vindicated&quot;.

Also in 1646, the General Court of Massachusetts referred to the Fundamental Laws of England in regard to &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, while defending their representative and legislative autonomy in their address to the Long Parliament.

In his 1670 trial, William Penn called upon the phrase many times, including &quot;However, this I leave upon your Consciences, who are of the Jury (and my sole Judges) that if these Ancient Fundamental Laws, which relate to Liberty and Property, and (are not limited to particular Persuasions in Matters of Religion) must not be indispensably maintained and observed, Who can say he hath Right to the Coat upon his Back?&quot; The aftermath of the trial established Bushell&#x27;s Case, preventing a jury from being fined for its verdict.

In the 1774 pamphlet American Claim of Rights, South Carolina&#x27;s Chief Justice William Drayton wrote 

Other famous subscribers to the phrase include Sir Edward Coke (1522–1634), Emerich de Vattel (1714–1767), and Samuel Adams (1722–1803).

==Unwritten history==

Locke&#x27;s view in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; (1690) was &quot;that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions&quot;. This philosophy was in keeping with the view that the Fundamental Laws predated &quot;Magna Carta&quot; in both custom and natural law. Influenced by Locke, the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence stated: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;

For those who believed that the Fundamental Laws of England predated &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, there was debate about whether they arose from time immemorial, were somehow immanent to society, from post-Roman Saxon times, or from various combinations of these and other origins.

==20th century and later==

In &quot;MacCormick v. Lord Advocate&quot; (1953), an action over the legitimacy of the numeric Style of the British Sovereign, asserting only the style Elizabeth I for Elizabeth II would only carry legal authority in Scotland Lord President Cooper gave judicial recognition to the concept of a &quot;fundamental law&quot; of Scotland that merged with that of England into the law of Great Britain at the time of the Act of Union 1707, a corpus of law which the supremacy of Parliament may not extend to altering, as &quot;the principle of unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle and has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law&quot;. He raised as a hypothetical consideration the question of whether such fundamental laws could be judged by an English or Scottish court in the same manner as other countries consider constitutional cases. However, he left the matter open, saying &quot;I reserve my opinion.&quot;

The doctrine of parliamentary supremacy was upheld in the Privy Council by Lord Reid in 1969:

Under this precedent, Parliament has the legal authority to do anything, even though its Acts might contradict common-law principles of natural justice. The classic rebuttal or at least qualification is expressed by Albert Venn Dicey, whose 1885 text &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution&quot; argues that the will of the electorate must ultimately prevail over any attempt at tyranny: it is &quot;a political, not a legal fact&quot; that fundamental principles of natural justice cannot be denied. This implies that in most scenarios principles of the Fundamental Laws can be upheld by statutory interpretation or as an alternative since 1998 by issuing a Declaration of incompatibility.

Laws LJ in &quot;Thoburn v Sunderland City Council&quot; [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin) at [62] recognised what he called &quot;constitutional statutes&quot;:

In the present state of its maturity the common law has come to recognise that there exist rights which should properly be classified as constitutional or fundamental: see for example such cases as Simms [2000] 2 AC 115 per Lord Hoffmann at 131, Pierson v Secretary of State [1998] AC 539, [R v] Leech [1994] QB 198, Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd. [1993] AC 534, and [R v] Witham [1998] QB 575. And from this a further insight follows. We should recognise a hierarchy of Acts of Parliament as it were: &quot;ordinary&quot; statutes and &quot;constitutional&quot; statutes. The two categories must be distinguished on a principled basis. In my opinion a constitutional statute is one which (a) conditions the legal relationship between citizen and State in some general, overarching manner, or (b) enlarges or diminishes the scope of what we would now regard as fundamental constitutional rights. (a) and (b) are of necessity closely related: it is difficult to think of an instance of (a) that is not also an instance of (b). The special status of constitutional statutes follows the special status of constitutional rights. Examples are the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Union, the Reform Acts which distributed and enlarged the franchise, the HRA, the Scotland Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 1998. The ECA clearly belongs in this family. It incorporated the whole corpus of substantive Community rights and obligations, and gave overriding domestic effect to the judicial and administrative machinery of Community law. It may be there has never been a statute having such profound effects on so many dimensions of our daily lives. The ECA is, by force of the common law, a constitutional statute. (cf obiter remarks by the House of Lords in &quot;Watkins v Home Office&quot; [2006] UKHL 17 at [62])

In 2004 the Joint Committee of the House of Commons and House of Lords overseeing the drafting of the Civil Contingencies Bill published its first report in which, among other things, suggested:
*Amending the proposed clauses, operative in a State of Emergency, that would grant the Cabinet, by Emergency Regulations, the power &quot;to disapply or modify any Act of Parliament&quot; on the grounds that such a clause is overly wide.
*An amendment to preclude changes to the following Acts, which, it suggested, formed &quot;the fundamental parts of constitutional law&quot; of the United Kingdom:

The amendment was defeated and the bill passed without it, although the government did partially implement one recommendation—the Human Rights Act 1998 may not be amended by emergency regulations.

<text>A rogues&#x27; gallery (or rogues gallery) is a police collection of mug shots or other images of criminal suspects kept for identification purposes.

==History==
In 1855, Allan Pinkerton, founder of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, established a rogues&#x27; gallery – a compilation of descriptions, methods of operation (modi operandi), hiding places, and names of criminals and their associates. Another early collection was established circa 1854 or 1855 by the detective Isaiah W. Lees of the San Francisco Police Department.

Inspector Thomas Byrnes of the late-19th-century New York City Police Department popularized the term with his collection of photographs of known criminals, which was used for witness identification. Byrnes published some of these photos with details of the criminals in &quot;Professional Criminals of America&quot; (1886).

<doc id="585261" wikidata="Q3737429" url="?curid=585261" title="FYULABA">
<text>FYULABA is the sixth studio album by Canadian hardcore punk band SNFU. The album was released in 1996 by Epitaph Records. Its name is an acronym for &quot;Fuck You Up Like a Bad Accident&quot;. The album was the last of three albums released by SNFU on Epitaph. Eight years would pass before the proper followup, &quot;In the Meantime and In Between Time&quot;, was issued in 2004.

==Background and recording==
Throughout 1995 and early 1996, SNFU had toured extensively in support of their fifth studio album, &quot;The One Voted Most Likely to Succeed&quot;. Members Marc Belke, Brent Belke, and Rob Johnson had also spent time finalizing the &quot;Redemeer&quot; album released in 1996 by their side project the Wheat Chiefs. SNFU initially recorded demos for their sixth album in May with roadie and sound man Simon Head.

In June 1996, the band returned to Mushroom Studios, the site of the recording of &quot;The One Voted Most Likely to Succeed&quot;, to record &quot;FYULABA&quot;. Engineer Pete Wonsiak and mixer Dave Ogilvie, the latter known for his work with Skinny Puppy, were brought on for the sessions. While the recording went generally smoothly, singer Ken Chinn&#x27;s struggles with health and mental problems affected his productivity. Regardless, Marc Belke later remembered the sessions as personally satisfying and fulfilling. Singer Bif Naked made her second appearance on an SNFU record, singing backup vocals on &quot;You Make Me Thick&quot;.

The band took the album&#x27;s initial title, &quot;Fuck You Up Like a Bad Accident&quot;, from the American outsider artist and musician, Wesley Willis. The title was later shortened to its acronym form, &quot;FYULABA&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover was designed by Brad Lambert, but the design used on the cover was an unfinished version of the intended cover. The band later expressed dissatisfaction with final art.

==Release==
The album was released on September 24, 1996. The band shot a music video for the song &quot;Fate&quot;, their fifth promotional video overall. Their tour in support of the record began in October 1996.

Included in the pregap of the CD release is an audio recording of a heated argument between the band&#x27;s road crew and owners of a club in Kelowna, British Columbia on November 2, 1995. SNFU had played the venue that night, and Chinn and other associates of the band had had a negative encounter with one of the venue&#x27;s bouncers, leading to further conflict.

==Reception==
The album received mixed reviews from critics. Many praised the album&#x27;s musicality but puzzled over Chinn&#x27;s increasing interest in popular culture and tabloid headlines. A reviewer from &quot;The Onion&quot;&#x27;s &quot;A.V. Club&quot; called the album a &quot;veritable &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; of pop culture&quot; that is nonetheless &quot;dead-on musically&quot;. The &quot;A.V. Club&quot; reviewer described the band&#x27;s sound as a hybrid between the Dead Kennedys and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, and ultimately assessed &quot;FYULABA&quot; as &quot;an enjoyable album.&quot; Similarly, AllMusic critic Vincent Jeffries praised the record&#x27;s musicality in a retrospective review as &quot;some of the fastest punk attempted by the band in years,&quot; but worried that &quot;goofy lyrics prevent &quot;FYULABA&quot; from being a triumphant return to form.&quot; Jeffries also compared the band to &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic and concluded that &quot;[l]isteners willing to ignore the bad lyrics should get a charge out of the music, but this rather imposing condition should keep &quot;FYULABA&quot; off any must-have punk lists.&quot;

Other critics were more forgiving of the album&#x27;s lyrics while praising its musicality. Writing for &quot;Drop-D Magazine&quot;, critic Paul Watkin gave the album a favorable review, describing it as &quot;straight out, rapid fire punk, with the boys laying back into the crunchy guitars to highlight the choruses and screaming out back-up vocals.&quot; Watkin concludes that &quot;&quot;FYULABA&quot; is good and sincere and has some things to say.&quot;
