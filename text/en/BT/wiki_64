<text>The Environmental Audio Extensions (or EAX) are a number of digital signal processing presets for audio, present in Creative Technology Sound Blaster sound cards starting with the Sound Blaster Live and the Creative NOMAD/Creative ZEN product lines. Due to the release of Windows Vista in 2007, which deprecated the DirectSound3D API that EAX was based on, Creative discouraged EAX implementation in favour of its OpenAL-based EFX equivalent – though at that point relatively few games used the API.

==Technology==

EAX is a library of extensions to Microsoft&#x27;s DirectSound3D, itself an extension to DirectSound introduced with DirectX 3 in 1996 with the intention to standardize 3D audio for Microsoft Windows, adding environmental audio presets to DS3D&#x27;s audio positioning. Ergo, the aim of EAX has nothing to do with 3D audio positioning, this is usually done by a sound library like DirectSound3D or OpenAL. Rather, EAX can be seen as a library of sound effects written and compiled to be executed on a DSP instead of the CPU, often called &quot;hardware-accelerated&quot;.

The aim of EAX was to create more ambiance within video games by more accurately simulating a real-world audio environment. Up to EAX 2.0, the technology was based around the effects engine aboard the E-mu 10K1 on Creative Technology&#x27;s and the Maestro2 on ESS1968 chipset driven sound cards. The hardware accelerated effects engine is an E-mu FX8010 DSP integrated into the Creative Technology&#x27;s audio chip and was historically used to enhance MIDI output by adding effects (such as reverb and chorus) to the sampled instruments on &#x27;wavetable&#x27; sample-based synthesis cards (which is often confused with the &quot;wavetable synthesis&quot; developed by Wolfgang Palm of PPG and Michael Mcnabb in the late-1970s, however not related). A similar effects DSP was also present on Creative&#x27;s cards back to the AWE 32. However, the EMU10K1&#x27;s DSP was faster and more flexible and was able to produce not only MIDI output but also other outputs, including the digital sound section.

Developers taking advantage of EAX choose an environment for their game&#x27;s setting and the sound card uses the mathematical DSP digital filter presets for that environment. The original EAX was quite primitive, only offering 26 presets and 3 parameters for more accurate adjustment of the listener parameters and 1 parameter for the sources. Each revision of the technology increased the available effects. &quot;EAX Advanced HD&quot; (also known as EAX 3) and up provide support for new environmental transitions, new effects, and multiple active effects. Further additions include smooth changes between EAX environment presets and audio occlusion effects (simulating a wall between player and sound source).

EAX was used in many popular titles of the time, including &quot;Half-Life&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, &quot;Rogue Spear&quot;, &quot;Doom 3&quot;, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, and &quot;Prey&quot;. These games support EAX 4.0 if audio hardware with an OpenAL-supporting driver is present. Because hardware acceleration for DirectSound and DirectSound3D was dropped in Windows Vista, OpenAL runtime software is required to enable EAX in many games, it still functions in Windows 10, although OpenAL was also discontinued by Creative. OpenAL Soft, an open source version of OpenAL, is still actively maintained, and can be used by game developers, and to enable EAX sound in older games.

Most releases of EAX versions coincided with increases in the number of simultaneous voices processable in hardware by the audio processor: the original EAX 1.0 supports 8 voices, while EAX 5.0 allows 128 voices (and up to 4 effects applied to each). Creative cards are generally backwards compatible with older EAX versions, although hardware accelerated DSP processing of these effects only happens on cards with EMU chips. Most audio solutions from Creative released after the X-Fi Titanium HD (except for the Audigy Rx) and other companies offer EAX software emulation of varying degrees instead.

===Future development===
In Creative&#x27;s OpenAL 1.1 specification, an alternative software system for 3D sound which Creative made, EAX should be considered deprecated as a developer interface. New development should use OpenAL&#x27;s EFX interface, which emulates all previous EAX functionality and is more tightly coupled with the overall OpenAL framework.

Creative stopped updating OpenAL also, although an open source version, OpenAL Soft is still actively maintained.

==EAX emulation==

When Windows Vista discontinued DirectSound3D, Creative made a software package called OpenAL which allows many Windows EAX-carrying games to play software and hardware (soundcard driven) mode EAX with varying success. OpenAL builds on the EAX extensions with EFX extensions. OpenAL still installs and functions on Windows 10, although is no longer actively maintained and released. An open source version called OpenAL Soft is available which is actively maintained, although it has less support for all versions of EAX.

Realtek released the &quot;Realtek 3D Soundback Beta 0.1&quot; software package to allow Realtek cards to play EAX and DirectSound3D on Windows Vista and newer operating systems. It may work with your Realtek soundcard in Windows 10. It requires Windows Vista compatibility mode to install.

nForce soundcards feature native support for EAX. The games that use EAX with nForce may need files changed to run properly.

Rapture3D supports EAX, it is a commercial wrapper for OpenAL used in games such as Dirt 3.

Wine implements software emulation of a subset of EAX.

In addition to physical soundcard devices, Creative released EAX emulation software (Creative ALchemy) for a range of computers and motherboards that had Creative-made onboard audio. Creative ALchemy will not function unless it detects a Creative Labs device.

===Sound Blaster Audigy ADVANCED MB===
* The Sound Blaster Audigy ADVANCED MB includes Creative Audio Center, Creative MediaSource 5 Player/Organizer, Creative WaveStudio 7, Creative ALchemy; 
Also known as &quot;Sound Blaster Audigy ADVANCED MB&quot;, it is similar to Audigy 2 SE, but the software supports EAX 3.0, which supports 64-channel software wavetable (sample-based synthesis) with DirectSound acceleration, but without hardware accelerated &#x27;wavetable&#x27; sample-based synthesis. DAC is rated 95 dB Signal-to-Noise Ratio.

It is available as an integrated option for Dell Inspiron, Studio and XPS notebooks.

Later versions of the driver support EAX 5.0.

<text>The siliqua (. siliquas or siliquae) is the modern namegiven without any ancient evidence to confirm the designationto small, thin, Roman silver coins produced in the 4th century and later. When the coins were in circulation, the Latin word was a unit of weight or value defined by one late Roman writer as one twenty-fourth of a Roman solidus.
The term siliqua comes from the &quot;siliqua graeca&quot;, the seed of the carob tree, which in the Roman weight system is equivalent to of a scruple ( of a Roman pound or about 0.19 grams).

The term has been applied in modern times to various silver coins on the premise that the coins were valued at of the gold solidus (which weighed of a Roman pound) and therefore represented a siliqua of gold in value. Since gold was worth about 12 times as much as silver in ancient Rome (in Diocletian&#x27;s Edict on Maximum Prices of 301), such a silver coin would have a theoretical weight of 2.22 grams ((4.45 grams/24)x12 = 2.22 grams). This has not prevented the term from being applied today to silver coins issued by Constantine, which initially weighed 3.4 grams and to the later &quot;heavy siliqua&quot; of Constantius II of c. 3 grams, but it would fit the later &quot;light&quot; or &quot;reduced siliqua&quot; from after the reform of 355 which weighed about 2.2 grams. The term is one of convenience, as no name for these coins is indicated by contemporary sources. Thin silver coins as late as the 7th century which weigh about 2–3 grams are known as siliquas by numismatic convention.

The majority of examples suffer striking cracks (testimony to their fast production) or extensive clipping (removing silver from the edge of the coin), and thus to find both an untouched and undamaged example is fairly uncommon. It is thought that by clipping, siliquaes provided the first coinage of the Saxons, as this reduced them to around the same size as a sceat, and there is considerable evidence from archaeological sites of this period, that siliquas and many other Roman coins were utilized by Saxons as pendants, lucky charms, currency, and curiosities.

<text>Radymno ( &quot;Radymno&quot;, &quot;Redem&quot;) is a town in south-eastern Poland with 5,543 inhabitants It has been part of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship since its creation in 1999. Radymno was previously in the Przemyśl Voivodeship between 1975–1998.

==History==

First traces of human settlement in what today is Radymno date back to the Neolithic times, as in 1958, archaeologists found remains of a 2nd-century settlement. In the early Middle Ages, the area was part of Polish state, but in 981, it was seized by Kievan Rus&#x27;. The area was then captured and lost by Poland two more times. In the mid-13th century it fell under Mongol suzerainty, and afterwards it was eventually captured by Polish King Casimir III the Great in mid-14th century.

In 1366, a nobleman Bernard of Szynwałd received permission from Casimir III to establish a settlement in the fields. In 1384, Radymno was presented to the Bishops of Przemyśl, and in 1431 King Władysław II Jagiełło gave town charter to the village. Due to its location by the San, and along a busy merchant route, Radymno was an important trade and market center. The town, however, was looted by Wallachians (1488) and Crimean Tatars (1502, 1624). Furthermore, it burned in fires (1603, 1638, 1647). To protect it from further raids, Radymno was fortified in 1625, but in 1656 it was captured by Swedes, and in 1657 by Transilvanians during the Swedish invasion of Poland. Swedish wars left Radymno in ruins, and the town for many years did not recover from widespread destruction. In late July 1683, the army of Hetman Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski camped near Radymno, on its way towards Vienna (see Battle of Vienna).

In the second half of the 18th century, before the Partitions of Poland, the population of Radymno was 1200, with 154 houses, three churches, hospital, parish school, two brickyards, and a residence of the Bishops of Przemyśl. In the middle of 18th century, Radymno had a population of 860 Roman Catholics, 196 people of Greek Catholic faith, and 26 Jews.

As a result of the First Partition of Poland (Treaty of St-Petersburg dated 5 July 1772), Radymno was annexed by the Habsburg monarchy. It was part of the &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaft Jaroslau&quot; (Jarosław County). It formed part of the newly formed Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (Austrian Partition of Poland), within which it remained until November 1918, when Poland regained independence and control of the town.
In 1860, Radymno received rail connection with Przemyśl. Austrian government for a while considered construction of a fortress here, but changed their minds and created Przemyśl Fortress instead. In 1857–1867 Radymno was the seat of a county. In late 19th century, the town had the population of 2700.

On May 24, 1915, the Battle of Radymno took place between Russian 8th Army of General Aleksei Brusilov, and German-Austrian 8th Army under General August von Mackensen. The town was almost completely destroyed.

In the Second Polish Republic, Radymno belonged to the Jarosław County in the Lwów Voivodeship. According to the 1921 census, it had a population of 1,907, 54.3% Polish and 42.4% Jewish.

===World War II===

On September 10, 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, which started World War II, German 4th Light Division crossed the San here, after a very light resistance and barely any battle with Polish Army&#x27;s Jarosław Group under Colonel Jan Wójcik, who just escaped to the East as quickly as he could leaving Poland to defend itself. According to the memoir of Dov Hister, during the German invasion of Radymno three Polish Army Youth took out a position in the Council&#x27;s tower, the Germans blown the tower with one cannon shot and killed and buried the three boys under the tower&#x27;s rubble.

Radymno fell under German occupation, and the &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town to commit various atrocities against the populace. Officers of the local Polish military unit were among the victims of the large Katyn massacre, which was carried out by the Russians in April–May 1940. During the war, groups of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which operated in the area, murdered 59 Poles, including 29 killed in the village of Michałówka. Of the estimated 1,200 Jews in Radymno prior to the World War II only a handful survived, many were handed over by the Ukrainian&#x27;s collaborators to the Germans and their Nazi regime. Some of the Jews were murdered by the Nazis outside the town in September 1939. The Germans operated a forced labour camp for Jews in the town in 1942–1943. The story of the Jewish residents of Radymno is documented in Dov Hister book The Power of Survival.

Radymno was captured by the Red Army on July 26, 1944, after heavy fighting with German armoured units, and afterwards it was restored to Poland.

<text>The National Party of Canada was considered a left-wing nationalist political party that was founded in Canada in 1979 to promote Canadian independence.

The party&#x27;s leader, Robin Mathews, was an active member and cultural critic for the Waffle movement in the New Democratic Party (NDP).

During the 1980 federal election, held on February 18, 1980, of that year, Mathews ran as the National Party candidate in Ottawa Centre. He placed fifth in a field of 10 candidates, following the Liberal, Progressive Conservative, NDP and Rhinoceros Party candidates but ahead of three independents: John Turmel, a Communist, and a Marxist–Leninist.) Mathews collected 171 votes, or 0.39% of the total.

Don Hayward was the party&#x27;s candidate in the Toronto riding of Broadview—Greenwood. He received 53 votes (0.17%), finishing seventh against New Democratic Party candidate Bob Rae. A 33-year-old factory worker, he expressed concern about American dominance of Canadian industry.

The party dissolved during the later part of the 1980s.

It should not be confused with the National Party that nominated candidates in the 1993 election.

<doc id="576456" wikidata="Q170652" url="?curid=576456" title="Great Blizzard of 1888">
<text>The Great Blizzard of 1888, also known as the Great Blizzard of &#x27;88 or the Great White Hurricane (March 11–14, 1888), was one of the most severe recorded blizzards in American history. The storm paralyzed the East Coast from the Chesapeake Bay to Maine, as well as the Atlantic provinces of Canada. Snow fell from in parts of New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and sustained winds of more than produced snowdrifts in excess of . Railroads were shut down and people were confined to their homes for up to a week. Railway and telegraph lines were disabled, and this provided the impetus to move these pieces of infrastructure underground. Emergency services were also affected during this blizzard.

==Storm details==

The weather was unseasonably mild just before the blizzard, with heavy rains that turned to snow as temperatures dropped rapidly. On March 12, New York City dropped from to , and rain changed to snow at 1 A.M. The storm began in earnest shortly after midnight on March 12 and continued unabated for a full day and a half. In a 2007 article, the National Weather Service estimated that this nor&#x27;easter dumped as much as of snow in parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts, while parts of New Jersey and New York had up to . Most of northern Vermont received from to .

Drifts averaged , over the tops of houses from New York to New England, with reports of drifts covering three-story houses. The highest drift was recorded in Gravesend, Brooklyn at . of snow fell in Saratoga Springs, New York; in Albany, New York; in New Haven, Connecticut; and in New York City. The storm also produced severe winds; wind gusts were reported, although the highest official report in New York City was , with a gust reported at Block Island. On March 13, New York City recorded a low of , the coldest so late in the season, with the high rising to only .

==Impacts==
In New York, neither rail nor road transport was possible anywhere for days, and drifts across the New York–New Haven rail line at Westport, Connecticut, took eight days to clear. Transportation gridlock as a result of the storm was partially responsible for the creation of the first underground subway system in the United States, which opened nine years later in Boston. As well as the opening of New York&#x27;s first underground subway line in 1911, later expanding into the New York City Subway. The New York Stock Exchange was closed for two days. A full two day weather related closure would not occur again until Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Similarly, telegraph infrastructure was disabled, isolating Montreal and most of the large northeastern U.S. cities from Washington, D.C. to Boston for days. Following the storm, New York began placing its telegraph and telephone infrastructure underground to prevent their destruction.

Fire stations were immobilized, and property loss from fire alone was estimated at $25 million (equivalent to $ million in 2025).

From the Chesapeake Bay through the New England area, more than 200 ships were either grounded or wrecked, resulting in the deaths of at least 100 seamen. Efforts were made to push the snow into the Atlantic Ocean. Severe flooding occurred after the storm due to melting snow, especially in the Brooklyn area, which was susceptible to flooding because of its topography.

Not all areas were notably affected by the Blizzard of 1888; an article in the &quot;Cambridge Press&quot; published five days after the storm noted that the &quot;fall of snow in this vicinity was comparatively small, and had it not been accompanied by a strong wind it would have been regarded as rather trifling in amount, the total depth, on a level, not exceeding ten inches&quot;.

Roscoe Conkling, an influential Republican politician, died as a result of the storm after attempting to walk home during the blizzard.

On October 1, 1888, an article appeared in the first issue of the National Geographic Society magazine about the great blizzard. It was written by Edward Everett Hayden and described the blizzard and the courageous and successful struggle, told by boat-keeper Robert Robinson, of the crew from the pilot-boat &quot;Charles H. Marshall, No. 3&quot;.

<text>Lesko (or &quot;Lisko&quot; until 1926; ; , alias &quot;Olesco Lescovium&quot;; ) is a town in south-eastern Poland with a population of 5,755 situated in the Bieszczady mountains. It is located in the heartland of the Doły (Pits), and its average altitude is above sea level, although there are some hills located within the confines of the city. Since 2002 it has been the capital of Lesko County.

Lesko is situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (since 1999); previously it was in Krosno Voivodeship (1975–1998).

==History==
Lesko was probably founded in the fourteenth century; records first mention it in 1436. It was granted its town charter in approximately 1469, when it was owned by the Kmita family. In the seventeenth century, the town was quite an important centre of trade and craftsmanship, with approximately 1,500 inhabitants. Its heyday ended in 1704, when it was looted by the Swedish troops during the Great Northern War.

In 1772, following the First Partition of Poland, the town was located in the Austrian Empire (from 1867 Austria-Hungary) until Poland regained its independence in 1918.
In 1872 a railway line passing just north of the town was built.

In 1890 the Jewish population of Lesko was 2,425.

In September 1939, following the territorial division of Poland by the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, the border between German and Soviet occupation zones ran along the river San in the area of Lesko. Thus the town ended up in the Soviet zone, as it was located on the eastern bank of the river. In 1940 to 1941, as part of the construction of the Molotov Line along the new border, the Soviets constructed a line of bunkers along the river to defend the river crossings, some of them right in the town. During Operation Barbarossa the Germans destroyed the bunkers in the initial days of their invasion (their ruins exist to this day). The town was liberated from the Germans by the Red Army in September, 1944. In 1945 the border between Poland and the Soviet Union was moved somewhat eastwards from the San river, so Lesko ended up in Poland following the postwar territorial rearrangements. Nevertheless, it remained very close to the Soviet border until the 1951 Polish–Soviet territorial exchange which moved the border further eastward.

During the war, after the town was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941, its Jewish community (about 60% of the town&#x27;s population) was murdered in the Holocaust.

In the immediate postwar years the area was the scene of the fighting between Polish military forces and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The fighting ended after the Ukrainian population was expelled in the course of Operation Vistula in 1947. The city and its economy only started to recover in the 1950s, after a government program encouraging people from other areas of Poland to settle there.

Currently Lesko is a gateway to the Bieszczady Mountains. The city has numerous outdoor recreational clubs.

==Climate==
Lesko has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;) using the isotherm or a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;) using the isotherm.

Built in the late gothic style, from stone and brick. Damaged by a Swedish attack during the Deluge, reconstructed. A Baroque interior from 1759 has survived. Reconstructed again in 1889, with a neogothic tower added. Next to the church a Baroque bell tower built from 1725 to 1764. Franciszek Pułaski (died 1769), cousin of general Kazimierz Pułaski, is buried in the church.

<text>Leżajsk (; ; ), officially the Free Royal City of Leżajsk (), is a town in southeastern Poland with 13,871 inhabitants. It has been situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship since 1999 and is the capital of Leżajsk County.

Leżajsk is famed for its Bernadine basilica and monastery, built by the architect Antonio Pellacini. The basilica contains a highly regarded pipe organ from the second half of the 17th century and organ recitals take place there. It stands as one of Poland&#x27;s official national Historic Monuments (&quot;Pomnik historii&quot;), as designated April 20, 2005, and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland. Leżajsk is also home of the Leżajsk brewery. The town is crossed by a forest creek &quot;‘Jagoda’&quot;.

==History==

Leżajsk is an old Polish royal town. The development of Leżajsk was slow, due to numerous and devastating Tatar and Wallachian raids, which took place in 1498, 1500, 1509, 1519 and 1524. Following these raids, Polish kings granted several privileges to the looted town, and finally, on September 23, 1524 in Lwów, King Sigismund I the Old decided to move Leżajsk to a new location, which was easier to defend. The town was moved some 5 kilometers south-west, and its new name was &quot;Leżajsk Zygmuntowski&quot;. The old location is since known as the village Stare Miasto (&quot;Old Town&quot;). During the reign of Sigismund II Augustus, Leżajsk prospered due to protection of its starosta (local governor), Krzysztof Szydłowiecki (Odrowaz coat of arms), who was Crown Chancellor. In 1608, Bernadine monks from nearby Przeworsk were brought to Lezajsk by Bishop of Przemyśl, and two years later, the first brick church was built. In 1624 Lezajsk was looted and burned by Crimean Tatars and the subsequent Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660) brought more destruction.

Following the First Partition of Poland (1772), Leżajsk was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained in Austrian Galicia until November 1918. In 1809, the town was captured by the Duchy of Warsaw, but soon afterwards, it was retaken by the Austrians. In 1896–1900, a rail line connecting Lezajsk with Przeworsk and Rozwadow was completed. The town suffered during World War I, as Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies fought there in 1914 and 1915. Lezajsk was occupied by Russians between November 1914 and May 1915.

In 1918 Poland regained independence and control of the town. In the Second Polish Republic, Leżajsk belonged to Łańcut County of the Lwów Voivodeship. In July 1929, the town was visited by President Ignacy Mościcki.

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, on September 13, 1939, Leżajsk was captured by the Wehrmacht. Afterwards, the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town to commit various atrocities against the population. On November 3, 1939, the German security police carried out mass arrests of local Poles as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. The Poles were then either imprisoned in the local prison or massacred at the local cemetery. Among the massacred Poles were teachers, school principals, priests and military officers. Poles from Leżajsk were also among the victims of the large Katyn massacre, committed by the Russians in April–May 1940. During the German occupation, the Home Army was very active in the area. Since May 1940, underground Polish newspaper &quot;Odwet&quot; was distributed in Leżajsk by the Polish resistance movement. On May 28, 1943, Germans shot 43 residents of the town. Leżajsk was captured by the Home Army on July 27, 1944.

==Jewish community==
The Jewish cemetery in Leżajsk is a place of pilgrimage for Jews from all over the world, who come to visit the tomb of Elimelech, the great 18th century Hasidic Rebbe. From the early 1500s until the advent of World War II and the Holocaust, there was a major Jewish presence in Leżajsk. After the Jewish expulsions from Spain in 1492, many Jews ended up in Leżajsk. According to the census of 1764, the community numbered 909 people, and by the turn of the 20th century, there were 1,700 Jews in the community. Between the two world wars, 4,500 Jews were living in Lezajsk.

When Nazi Germany invaded Leżajsk in September 1939, almost all Jews in the town were brought to the Soviet-Occupied zone, where they were later massacred by the Einsatzgruppen.

<doc id="576462" wikidata="Q733814" url="?curid=576462" title="John McCormack (tenor)">
<text>Count John Francis McCormack (14 June 1884 – 16 September 1945), was an Irish lyric tenor celebrated for his performances of the operatic and popular song repertoires, and renowned for his diction and breath control. He was also a Papal Count. McCormack became a naturalised American citizen before returning to live in Ireland.

==Early life==

John Francis McCormack was born on 14 June 1884 in Athlone, County Westmeath, Ireland, the second son and fifth of the 11 children (five of whom died in infancy or childhood) of Andrew McCormack and his wife Hannah Watson. His parents were both from Galashiels, Scotland and worked at the Athlone Woollen Mills, where his father was a foreman. He was baptised in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Athlone on 23 June 1884.

McCormack received his early education from the Marist Brothers in Athlone and later attended Summerhill College, Sligo. He sang in the choir of the old St Peters church in Athlone under his choirmaster Michael Kilkelly. When the family moved to Dublin, he sang in the choir of St Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral where he was discovered by Vincent O&#x27;Brien. In 1903, he won the coveted gold medal of the Dublin Feis Ceoil.

In March 1904, McCormack became associated with James Joyce, who at the time had singing ambitions himself. Richard Ellmann, in his biography of Joyce, states that &quot;Joyce spent several evenings with him&quot; (i.e. McCormack), practising; along with Joyce&#x27;s acquaintance Richard Best; McCormack persuaded Joyce to enter the Feis Ceoil that year, where the not yet famous writer was awarded the Bronze Medal (3rd prize).

==Career==

Fundraising activities on his behalf enabled McCormack to travel to Italy in 1905 to receive voice training by Vincenzo Sabatini (father of the novelist Rafael Sabatini) in Milan. Sabatini found McCormack&#x27;s voice naturally tuned and concentrated on perfecting his breath control, an element that would become part of the basis of his renown as a vocalist.

In 1906, he made his operatic début at the Teatro Chiabrera, Savona. The next year, he began his first important operatic performance at Covent Garden in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, becoming the theatre&#x27;s youngest principal tenor. In 1909, he began his career in America. Michael Scott (&quot;The Record of Singing&quot; 1978) writes that at this stage of his career, he should be considered a tenor of the Italian style—and he sang (and recorded) French operatic arias in the Italian language. Steane (&quot;The Grand Tradition&quot; 1971) stresses that, for all his later devotion to the concert platform (and his Irish identity), he was (for albeit a relatively brief period) in essence an Italian operatic tenor.

In February 1911, McCormack played Lieutenant Paul Merrill in the world premiere of Victor Herbert&#x27;s opera &quot;Natoma&quot; with Mary Garden in the title role. Later that year, he toured Australia after Dame Nellie Melba engaged him, then at the height of his operatic career, aged 27, as a star tenor for the Melba Grand Opera Season. He returned for concert tours in subsequent years.

By 1912, he was beginning to become involved increasingly with concert performances, where his voice quality and charisma ensured that he became the most celebrated lyric tenor of his time. He did not, however, retire from the operatic stage until after his performance of 1923 in Monte Carlo (see biography below), although by then the top notes of his voice had contracted. Famous for his extraordinary breath control, he could sing 64 notes on one breath in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Il mio tesoro&quot; from &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and his Handelian singing was just as impressive in this regard.

McCormack made hundreds of recordings, his best-known and most commercially successful series of records being those for the Victor Talking Machine Company during the 1910s and 1920s. He was Victor&#x27;s most popular Red Seal recording artist after tenor Enrico Caruso. In the 1920s, he sang regularly on radio and later appeared in two sound films, &quot;Song o&#x27; My Heart&quot;, released in 1930, playing an Irish tenor, and as himself appearing in a party scene in &quot;Wings of the Morning&quot; (1937), the first British three-strip Technicolor feature.

McCormack was one of the first artists to record the popular ballad &quot;I Hear You Calling Me&quot;, written in 1908 by Harold Harford and Charles Marshall; he recorded it twice for Odeon starting in 1908 and a further four times for Victor between 1910 and 1927 – it became his best seller. He was the first artist to record the famous World War I song &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; in 1914; He also recorded a best-selling version of another popular World War I tune &quot;Keep The Home Fires Burning&quot; in 1917. He also sang songs expressive of Irish nationalism — his recording of &quot;The Wearing of the Green&quot;, a song about the Irish rebellion of 1798, encouraged 20th-century efforts for Irish Home Rule — and endorsed the Irish Nationalist estrangement from the United Kingdom. McCormack was associated particularly with the songs of Thomas Moore, notably &quot;The Harp That Once Through Tara&#x27;s Halls&quot;, &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot;, &quot;Believe Me If All (Those Endearing Young Charms)&quot;, and &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot;. Between 1914 and 1922, he recorded almost two dozen songs with violin accompaniment provided by Fritz Kreisler, with whom he also toured. He recorded songs of Hugo Wolf for the Hugo Wolf Society in German. In 1918, he recorded the song &quot;Calling Me Home to You&quot;.

In 1917, McCormack became a naturalised citizen of the United States. In June 1918, he donated $11,458 ($215,296 in 2022) towards the USA&#x27;s World War I effort. By then, his career was a huge financial success, earning millions in his lifetime from record sales and appearances.

By 1920, Edwin Schneider had become McCormack&#x27;s accompanist and the two were &quot;inseparable&quot;. When Schneider retired, Gerald Moore took over as accompanist from 1939 to 1943.

In 1927, McCormack moved into Moore Abbey, Monasterevin, County Kildare, and adopted a very opulent lifestyle by Irish standards. He also owned apartments in London and New York. He hoped that one of his racehorses, such as Golden Lullaby, would win The Derby, but they never did.

McCormack also bought Runyon Canyon in Hollywood in 1930 from Carman Runyon. McCormack saw and liked the estate while there filming &quot;Song o&#x27; My Heart&quot; (1930), an early all-talking, all-singing picture. McCormack used his salary for this movie to purchase the estate and built a mansion he called &quot;San Patrizio&quot;, after Saint Patrick. McCormack and his wife lived in the mansion until they returned to England in 1938.

McCormack toured often, and in his absence, the mansion was often let to celebrities such as Janet Gaynor and Charles Boyer. The McCormacks made many friends in Hollywood, among them Errol Flynn, Will Rogers, John Barrymore, Basil Rathbone, Ronald Colman, Charles E. Toberman and the Dohenys. After his farewell tour of America in 1937, the McCormacks deeded the estate back to Carman Runyon expecting to return to the estate at a later date. World War II intervened and McCormack did not return.

McCormack originally ended his career at the Royal Albert Hall in London, during 1938. However, a year after that farewell concert, he was back singing for the Red Cross and in support of the war effort. He gave concerts, toured, broadcast and recorded in this capacity until 1943 when poor health finally forced him to retire permanently.

== Personal life and death ==

McCormack married Lily Foley in 1906; they had two children, Cyril and Gwen.

Ill with emphysema, he bought a house near the sea, &quot;Glena&quot;, Booterstown, Dublin. After years of increasingly poor health, and a series of infectious illnesses, including influenza and pneumonia, McCormack died at his home in Booterstown on 16 September 1945. He is buried in Deansgrange Cemetery, St. Patrick&#x27;s section, plot reference E/120.

==Honours==



McCormack was much honoured and decorated for his musical career. In 1928, he received the title of Papal Count from Pope Pius XI in recognition of his work for Catholic charities. He had earlier received three papal knighthoods, Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre (KHS), Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (KSG) and Knight of the Order of St. Sylvester (KSS). He was also a Knight of Malta and a Privy Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape, an honour which is known now as a Gentlemen of His Holiness.

One of the most famous performances of McCormack&#x27;s Irish career was his singing of César Franck&#x27;s &quot;Panis angelicus&quot; to the hundreds of thousands who thronged Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park for the 1932 Eucharistic Congress.

A life-sized bronze statue of McCormack by sculptor Elizabeth O&#x27;Kane was established in Dublin on 19 June 2008. The statue stands in the Iveagh Gardens, close to the National Concert Hall.

In his hometown of Athlone, he is commemorated by the Athlone Institute of Technology who named their performance hall after him, the John McCormack Hall.

He is also commemorated by an English Heritage blue plaque on the house near Hampstead in London, 24 Ferncroft Avenue, where he lived from 1908 until 1913.

A silver €10 collectors coin with a mintage of 8,000 pieces was issued by the Central Bank of Ireland in January 2014 featuring a portrait of McCormack; the coin was issued as part of the EUROPA star series in keeping with the 2014 theme of European musicians.

A statue of the tenor was unveiled in a square newly named in his honour outside the Civic Centre in Athlone on 24 October 2014. The sculpture, created by the Irish artist Rory Beslin, was celebrated by free admission to an exhibition of the celebrated singer&#x27;s memorabilia.

In 1984, a street in Washington, D.C., was named in his honour. The street is near the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and commemorates McCormack&#x27;s role in supporting its construction by singing a benefit recital in 1928.

<text>Nisko is a town in Nisko County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, Poland on the San River, with a population of 15,048 inhabitants as of 31 December 2021. Together with neighbouring city of Stalowa Wola, Nisko creates a small agglomeration.

==History==

Nisko was first mentioned in a document dated 15 April 1439, in which King Władysław III of Varna handed the villages of Nysky, Zaoszicze and Pyelaskowicze to a local nobleman. Furthermore, Nisko was also mentioned by Jan Długosz, in his work &quot;Liber beneficiorum dioecesis Cracoviensis&quot;. The establishment of the village was probably the result of catastrophic Mongol Invasion of Poland, which decimated the population of Lesser Poland. Residents of burned villages and towns resettled in the areas north of the enormous Sandomierz Forest. Probably in the second half of the 13th century, a village was established on a hill near the San river. Nisko was a royal village administratively located in the Sandomierz County in the Sandomierz Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province.

Due to the location on the edges of the forest, local residents supported themselves by hunting and trade of timber, which was transported to other centers along the San and the Vistula waterways. In the 1570s, peasants from Nisko and other locations rebelled against the Starosta of Sandomierz, Andrzej Firlej. In 1578, they met with King Stephen Báthory, who stayed in Tarnogród, asking him for justice. The king supported the peasants, urging Firlej to come to Warsaw. On 10 November 1583, Batory issued a bill, in which he backed demands of the peasants.

For centuries Nisko remained a small village, whose development was halted during the Swedish invasion of Poland. On 28 March 1656, Stefan Czarniecki fought here Swedish troops, which advanced towards Lwów.
Following the First Partition of Poland, Nisko was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained within Austrian Galicia until November 1918. In 1867 Count Eugene Kinsky bought the Nisko estate to give it to his daughter Countess Marie Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau as a wedding present, which took place in Vienna on 21 September 1868. From 1868 to 1912 under Count Oliver Rességuier de Miremont and his family, the village grew to become one of the largest estates in then Austrian Galicia. A railroad station, a hospital, a church (three in present-day Nisko), schools, factories, Austrian Army Base (currently Polish Army Base) and a palace (now used as a hospital building) were built. Most of these buildings are still in use. The village was also the capital of administration unit, Nisko County.

The Nisko railway station is in operation since 14 January 1900.

===20th century===

In 1914, when World War I began, many buildings in Nisko were destroyed by the Russian Army, which attacked Austria-Hungary. In 1918, local Poles gained control over the government in Nisko and the village became part of the new-formed Second Polish Republic. In newly restored Poland, Nisko was the seat of a county in Lwów Voivodeship, but remained a village until 20 October 1933. According to the 1921 census, it had a population of 4,749, 90.8% Polish and 8.7% Jewish. On 19 January 1937 in Warsaw, a bill was signed, which created Southern Works (Zaklady Poludniowe) – a large steel plant, part of the Central Industrial Region. On 20 March 1937, first pine trees were cut in a forest in the village of Pławo, a few kilometers north of Nisko. In two years, a brand new city of Stalowa Wola was established around the plant. It was a milestone in history of the town, because several projects were started in the area, such as a foundry and a power-plant in the forests on the western boundary of Nisko. The programme of industrialization was stopped with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and Soviet Union in September 1939.
Already in the early stages of World War II, shortly after the German invasion of the town, the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town to commit various atrocities against the population. As part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, on November 10, 1939, the Germans deceitfully gathered Polish teachers from the town and its surroundings for a supposed formal meeting, then arrested them and imprisoned them in Rzeszów. During the war, Nisko became the focus of the Nazi German &quot;Nisko und Lublin Plan&quot; of forcible relocation of about 95,000 Jews from all over occupied Poland and from abroad in the name of German &quot;Lebensraum&quot;. Chief architect of the Holocaust, Adolf Eichmann, set up a transit camp in Nisko, from which the deportees were to be expelled eastward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning6/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The town was an important center of the Polish resistance movement, including the Home Army and Bataliony Chłopskie. Since early 1940, underground Polish press was distributed in the town. In March 1941, the Germans carried out mass arrests of resistance members involved in the distribution of Polish press in Nisko and other nearby towns. Arrested resistance members were then mostly imprisoned, interrogated and tortured in the local prison. The Polish resistance made an unsuccessful attempt to liberate the prisoners, after which the Germans deported the prisoners to the infamous Montelupich prison in Kraków, and then to the Auschwitz concentration camp. In 1944–1945, the Red Army and the Soviet NKVD arrested here a number of Poles, executing members of anti-communist resistance.

<text>Sieniawa (), is a town in southeastern Poland, in Przeworsk County in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship. It had a population of 2,127 inhabitants 

==History==

Sieniawa&#x27;s history dates back to the 17th century, and the town owes its existence to the once powerful Sieniawski family. It was founded in 1676, on initiative of Voivode of Volhynia and Starosta of Lwów, Mikolaj Hieronim Sieniawski, who owned enormous estates in eastern lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Sieniawa was founded in the area which was covered by the village of Dybków. The Sieniawski family wanted to make it main administrative center of their estates. In ca. 1650, a brick fortress was built on a hill near contemporary Sieniawa. In the following years, the Sieniawski family built their manor house near the fortress, and began construction of the town, together with the San river port. A Dominican church and abbey was built, and in the 1660s, walls were built, to protect Sieniawa from Crimean Tatars raids. Mikolaj Hieronim Sieniawski, the founder of the town, died at the age of 39, but his son Adam Mikolaj Sieniawski continued the work of his father, and invested heavily in Sieniawa. In 1731, Adam&#x27;s daughter Maria Zofia married Prince August Aleksander Czartoryski, and Sieniawa became property of the Czartoryski family. 
Until 1772, Sieniawa remained an important river port and a defensive establishment. Following the Partitions of Poland, the situation changed, and fortifications were not needed any longer. Since the new Austrian - Russian border was north of Sieniawa, the San lost its function of a waterway, and the town stagnated as part of Austrian Galicia. In 1855, Sieniawa belonged to the District of Przemyśl. The town remained property of the Czartoryski family, and was famous across Galicia for its bricklayers.
In May 1915 Sieniawa was almost completely destroyed, and in November 1918 the town became part of Second Polish Republic’s Lwów Voivodeship. In the interwar period, Sieniawa&#x27;s population declined, and unemployment was high, which resulted in street fights and demonstrations.

After the 1939 Invasion of Poland, Sieniawa was occupied by the Soviet Union, and between September 1939-June 1941, was a border town. Afterwards it was occupied by Nazi Germany until 1944. During the Holocaust, the town was the site of a Jewish ghetto.

<doc id="576469" wikidata="Q724164" url="?curid=576469" title="Denton Cooley">
<text>Denton Arthur Cooley (August 22, 1920 – November 18, 2016) was an American cardiothoracic surgeon famous for performing the first implantation of a total artificial heart. Cooley was also the founder and surgeon in-chief of The Texas Heart Institute, chief of Cardiovascular Surgery at clinical partner Baylor St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center, consultant in Cardiovascular Surgery at Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital and a clinical professor of Surgery at McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

== School and early career ==
Cooley was born August 22, 1920, in Houston, and graduated in 1941 from the University of Texas at Austin (UT), where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity and the Texas Cowboys, played on the basketball team, and majored in zoology. He became interested in surgery through several pre-medical classes he attended in college and began his medical education at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He completed his medical degree and his surgical training at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, where he also completed his internship. At Johns Hopkins, he worked with Dr. Alfred Blalock and assisted in the first &quot;Blue Baby&quot; procedure to correct an infant&#x27;s congenital heart defect. He is of Irish descent.

In 1946, Cooley was called to active duty with the Army Medical Corps and served as chief of surgical services at the station hospital in Linz, Austria. He was discharged in 1948 with the rank of captain and returned to complete his residency at Johns Hopkins, where he remained as an instructor in surgery. In 1950, he went to London to work with Russell Brock at the Royal Brompton Hospital.

== Major career events ==
In the 1950s, Cooley returned to Houston to become associate professor of surgery at Baylor College of Medicine and to work at its affiliate institution, The Methodist Hospital. Cooley began working with American cardiac surgeon, scientist, and medical educator Michael E. DeBakey. During this time, he worked on developing a new method of removing aortic aneurysms, the bulging weak spots that may develop in the wall of the artery.

In 1960, Cooley moved his practice to St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Hospital while continuing to teach at Baylor. In 1962, he founded The Texas Heart Institute with private funds and, following a dispute with DeBakey, resigned his position at Baylor in 1969.

His skill as a surgeon was demonstrated by successfully performing numerous bloodless open-heart surgeries on Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses patients beginning in the early 1960s.

He and his colleagues worked on developing new artificial heart valves from 1962 to 1967. During that period, mortality for heart valve transplants fell from 70% to 8%. In 1969, he became the first heart surgeon to implant an artificial heart designed by Domingo Liotta in a man, Haskell Karp, who lived for 65 hours. The next year, in 1970, &quot;he performed the first implantation of an artificial heart in a human when no heart replacement was immediately available.&quot;
On March 13, 1972, the Denton A. Cooley Cardiovascular Surgical Society was founded at the Texas Heart Institute by the Residents and Fellows of Cooley to honor him. Founding President Philip S. Chua had envisioned this exclusive society to foster academic, professional, and personal camaraderie among cardiac surgeons in the United States and around the world through scientific seminars and symposia. There are now more than 900 cardiac surgeons from more than 50 countries around the globe who are members of the Denton A. Cooley Cardiovascular Surgical Society. In the HBO film &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;, Cooley was portrayed by Timothy J. Scanlin, Jr.

During the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Cooley was asked by then-candidate George W. Bush to review vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney&#x27;s medical records, particularly concerning the status of his chronic heart condition.

== Personal life ==
Cooley&#x27;s interests included basketball, which he played in high school and as a three-year letterman for the UT men&#x27;s basketball team (1939–1941), and golf, which he became interested in during his youth and played for 68 years. The practice and training facility of the UT men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, the Denton A. Cooley Pavilion, which opened in 2003, was named in his honor. Among his other outside interests, Cooley played upright bass in a swing band called The Heartbeats from 1965 through the early 1970s.

Cooley reportedly answered in the affirmative when a lawyer during a trial asked him if he considered himself to be the best heart surgeon in the world. &quot;Don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s being rather immodest?” the lawyer replied. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; Cooley responded. &quot;But remember I&#x27;m under oath.&quot;

Cooley filed for bankruptcy in 1988, citing real estate debts during a market downturn.

Cooley and the heart surgeon Michael E. DeBakey had a professional rivalry that lasted more than 40 years; they made amends in a public rapprochement in 2007, when DeBakey was 99 years old and Cooley was 87. Cooley died on November 18, 2016, at the age of 96.

<text>The Vuoksi (, historically: &quot;Uzerva&quot;; ; ; ) is a river running through the northernmost part of the Karelian Isthmus from Lake Saimaa in southeastern Finland to Lake Ladoga in northwestern Russia. The river enters Lake Ladoga in three branches, an older main northern branch at Priozersk (Käkisalmi), a smaller branch a few kilometers to the north of it, and a new southern branch entering further southeast as Burnaya River (Finnish: Taipaleenjoki), which has become the main stream in terms of water discharge. Since 1857, the old northern distributaries drain only the lower reaches of the Vuoksi basin and are not fed by Lake Saimaa. The northern and southern branches actually belong to two separate river systems, which at times get isolated from each other in dry seasons.

The descent between Lake Saimaa and Lake Ladoga is . The entire run of the river is via the Priozersk branch, or via the Taipale (Burnaya) branch. It has a drainage basin of . For most of its length, the river broadens out to a series of lakes bound together by shorter riverlike connections. One of these lakes, &quot;Uusijärvi&quot; close to Priozersk, was renamed &#x27; in the Soviet Union.
The Vuoksi connects Lake Ladoga with central Finland, and was once an important route for trade and communication. A western branch, which disappeared due to ongoing land uplift, was an alternative route for the Karelians to reach the Gulf of Finland when the Neva River was blocked by enemies. Now the Saimaa Canal bypasses the Vuoksi and enters the Gulf of Finland in the Bay of Vyborg near the medieval city of Vyborg. 

During both the Winter and Continuation Wars the river Vuoksi was a major Finnish defensive line against the Soviet advance. The Mannerheim Line and VKT-line were located along the northern shore of its southern armlet. 

From the Industrial Revolution, power generated from Vuoksi&#x27;s rapids made the Vuoksi region Finland&#x27;s industrial center in the late 19th century. Since the Winter War (1940), the Karelian Isthmus has belonged to Russia and only of the river&#x27;s length remains in Finland. The major power stations at Tainionkoski and Imatra are on the Finnish side in the city of Imatra. 

The river&#x27;s surroundings, including the Korela Fortress (formerly: &quot;Käkisalmi&quot;), is a popular resort for Saint Petersburg&#x27;s residents. 

The river is famous for its rapids, for instance Imatrankoski in Imatra and rapid in the village of Losevo (Kiviniemi). The rapid junction of the Vuoksi and Suvanto/Lake Sukhodolskoye at Losevo is a popular area for kayak, canoe and catamaran competitions. 

A project is currently being discussed in Russia to destroy the rapids at Losevo and turn the River Burnaya, Lake Sukhodolskoye and lower portions of Vuoksi into a navigable canal, which would connect Lake Ladoga to the Gulf of Finland and allow oil tankers to bypass River Neva and the city of Saint Petersburg.

==Geological history==
Around 5,000 BP the waters of the Saimaa Lake penetrated Salpausselkä, forming the river emptying into Lake Ladoga in its northwestern corner and raising the level of the latter by . Lake Ladoga transgressed, flooding lowland lakes and the Vuoksi, and connected with the Baltic Sea at Heinjoki, to the east of present-day Vyborg. Ladoga&#x27;s level gradually sank and the River Neva, originating around 3100–2400 BP, drained its waters into the Gulf of Finland; but the Vuoksi still had a significant direct outflow connection to the Bay of Vyborg, possibly as late as in the 16th or 17th century AD. The connection disappeared due to ongoing land uplift.

In 1818, a canal was dug to drain spring flood waters from Lake Suvanto (now Lake Sukhodolskoye, a long narrow lake in the eastern part of the Karelian Isthmus) into Lake Ladoga; the canal unexpectedly eroded and turned into Taipaleenjoki (now Burnaya River). The Taipaleenjoki started draining Suvanto and decreased its level by . Originally Lake Suvanto flowed into the Vuoksi through a waterway at Kiviniemi (now Losevo), but as a result of the change, the waterway dried out. In 1857 a channel was dug there, but the stream reversed direction, creating rapids and rendering navigation at Kiviniemi impossible. Since 1857 Suvanto and Taipaleenjoki have constituted the southern branch of the Vuoksi, which has decreased the level of the original northern branch emptying into Ladoga near Kexholm (now Priozersk) by and has become the main stream.

<doc id="576478" wikidata="Q1450801" url="?curid=576478" title="Canadian Union of Fascists">
<text>The Canadian Union of Fascists was a fascist political party based in the city of Toronto in the 1930s with its western Canadian office in Regina, Saskatchewan. 

The party was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba in the summer of 1934 as the British Empire Union of Fascists by Canadian supporters of Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists after BUF member Hubert Cox visited the city in June 1934, claiming to be Mosley&#x27;s representative. The first leader was Howard Simpkin, a former lieutenant to Canadian Nationalist Party leader William Whittaker who led a group of people breaking away from the CNP, objecting to the party&#x27;s racialism, declaring that &quot;anti-semitism was a symptom of Germany not of Fascism&quot;, and advocated a more economic-oriented program instead built around the fascist economic policies of Mussolini&#x27;s Italy such as corporatism. The new party attracted around 200 people to its inaugural meeting on June 28, 1934, to hear Cox and Simpkin address the crowd. It soon changed its name to the Canadian Union of Fascists (or Canadian Union) and within a year had branches in Transcona, Manitoba, Toronto and Woodstock, Ontario, Regina, Saskatchewan, and Vancouver. It was also known as the Canadian Fascist Party. 

In Toronto a young high school student Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Crate joined the party after contacting the British Union of Fascists and being put in touch with CUF. He became the Toronto branch director and soon began recruiting members at York Memorial Collegiate Institute and elsewhere in Toronto. Crate edited the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Thunderbolt&quot;, in Toronto and soon displaced Simpkin as party leader.

The party had a hard time attracting supporters because most Canadians who supported fascism leaned towards the racist brand espoused by Adrien Arcand and others.

By 1936, &quot;The Globe&quot; was describing Crate in a front page headline as &quot;Canada&#x27;s No. 1 Fascist&quot; leading a party that claimed 8,000 members, with 30 members in Toronto and many more &quot;scattered&quot; throughout Western Canada. The party&#x27;s platform was described as consisting of the &quot;abolition of provincial governments and private monopolies, with a closer co-operation with Great Britain and the Empire&quot;. Canada would be as &quot;self-contained&quot; as possible, and would work with the British Union of Fascists to make the British Empire &quot;completely self-contained&quot;. Crate denied any connection between the CUF and Italian or German fascist groups though admitted being in correspondence with them. He admitted the CUF was affiliated with Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists. The party had its greatest number of members in Saskatchewan according to Crate, where Dr. R. Muir Johnstone was based as the party&#x27;s Western Canadian organizer. The party planned to run candidates in the next Saskatchewan provincial election, though it did not end up doing so, and in federal elections. The CUF claimed it would solve unemployment and poverty by creating a corporate state with a &quot;authoritative government&quot; and provincial governments being abolished. Private ownership would be maintained, but would be &quot;co-ordinated&quot;, and chain stores would be abolished in favour of independent stores. Monetary reform would &quot;liberate the state from the bonds of international Jewish finance.&quot; Crate also claimed that under the &quot;corporate state&quot;, &quot;married women will be compelled to retire from industry. Competition between men and women in industry will be done away with.&quot; The party, while claiming not to oppose people on &quot;racial&quot; or &quot;religious grounds&quot;, advocated a &quot;more selective immigration policy&quot;.

In 1937, Crate&#x27;s CUF formed an alliance with John Ross Taylor&#x27;s National Christian Party. The NCP had been founded by Taylor in alliance with Adrien Arcand&#x27;s Parti national social chrétien. However, Taylor broke with Arcand over religious differences and Taylor&#x27;s National Christian Party formed an alliance with the CUF with Crate being cross-appointed as the NCF&#x27;s secretary. By 1938, Taylor had dissolved the NCF into the CUF, becoming the CUF&#x27;s secretary and organizer. 

This disparity between the party and Arcand&#x27;s group would continue throughout the party&#x27;s existence. Before the government took action against Canadian fascist parties, the Canadian Union of Fascists and Arcand&#x27;s group held simultaneous fascist congresses in Toronto in early June 1938. Taylor organized the CUF&#x27;s rally and had intended to book Massey Hall but switched venue&#x27;s to the smaller Prince&#x27;s Hall on Bloor Street when it became clear the CUF would not be able to attract a large enough crowd to fill Massey Hall. Only 26 people attended the CUF rally, while 200 to 300 anti-fascists protested outside at a counterdemonstration organized by William Krehm&#x27;s Provisional Anti-Fascist Committee. Meanwhile, Arcand&#x27;s rally officially launching the National Unity Party of Canada drew a crowd of around 2,500 to Massey Hall on July 4, 1938. While the National Unity Party was a merger of Arcand&#x27;s Parti national social chrétien and the Canadian National Party, the Canadian Union of Fascists did not join the new party.

The CUF was banned on June 4, 1940, under the Defence of Canada Regulations and formally dissolved itself, telling its members to obey the law but to work for a negotiated peace. Crate escaped a treason charge but remained active in Winnipeg, publishing &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; from there until his arrest in 1942 for publishing subversive literature. He ended up in the Royal Canadian Navy at the end of the war.

The party, though it claimed not to be racist or antisemitic, did use antisemitic rhetoric with &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; publishing articles against &quot;international Jewish finance&quot; which it claimed &quot;controlled Communism&quot;, as well as reprinting articles by Joseph Goebbels.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to determine the duration of execution of a particular command.

==Overview==
codice_2 can exist as a standalone program (such as GNU time) or as a shell builtin in most cases (e.g. in sh, bash, tcsh or in zsh).

===User time vs system time===
The total CPU time is the combination of the amount of time the CPU or CPUs spent performing some action for a program and the amount of time they spent performing system calls for the kernel on the program&#x27;s behalf. When a program loops through an array, it is accumulating user CPU time. Conversely, when a program executes a system call such as codice_3 or codice_4, it is accumulating system CPU time.

===Real time vs CPU time===
The term &quot;real time&quot; in this context refers to elapsed wall-clock time, like using a stop watch. The total CPU time (user time + sys time) may be more or less than that value. Because a program may spend some time waiting and not executing at all (whether in user mode or system mode) the real time may be greater than the total CPU time. Because a program may fork children whose CPU times (both user and sys) are added to the values reported by the codice_5 command, but on a multicore system these tasks are run in parallel, the total CPU time may be greater than the real time.

==Usage==
To use the command, one simply precedes any command by the word codice_5, such as:
$ time ls

When the command completes, codice_5 will report how long it took to execute the codice_8 command in terms of user CPU time, system CPU time, and real time. The output format varies between different versions of the command, and some give additional statistics, as in this example:

$ time host wikipedia.org
wikipedia.org has address 103.102.166.224
wikipedia.org mail is handled by 50 mx2001.wikimedia.org.
wikipedia.org mail is handled by 10 mx1001.wikimedia.org.
host wikipedia.org 0.04s user 0.02s system 7% cpu 0.780 total


 (either a standalone program, or when Bash shell is running in POSIX mode AND is invoked as codice_9) reports to standard error output.

===time -p===
Portable scripts should use codice_9 mode, which uses a different output format, but which is consistent with various implementations:

$ time -p sha256sum /bin/ls
12477deb0e25209768cbd79328f943a7ea8533ece70256cdea96fae0ae34d1cc /bin/ls
real 0.00
user 0.00
sys 0.00


==Implementations==

===GNU time===
Current versions of GNU time, report more than just a time by default:

$ /usr/bin/time sha256sum /bin/ls
12477deb0e25209768cbd79328f943a7ea8533ece70256cdea96fae0ae34d1cc /bin/ls
0.00user 0.00system 0:00.00elapsed 100%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2156maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+96minor)pagefaults 0swaps


Format of the output for GNU time, can be adjusted using codice_11 environment variable, and it can include information other than the execution time (i.e. memory usage). This behavior is not available in general POSIX-compliant time, or when executing as codice_9.

Documentation of this can be usually accessed using codice_13.

====Method of operation====
According to the source code of the GNU implementation of codice_5, most information shown by codice_5 is derived from the codice_16 system call. On systems that do not have a codice_16 call that returns status information, the codice_18 system call is used instead.

===Bash===
In a popular Unix shell Bash, codice_5 is a special keyword, that can be put before a pipeline (or single command), that measures time of entire pipeline, not just a singular (first) command, and uses a different default format, and puts empty line before reporting times:

$ time seq 10000000 | wc -l
10000000

real 0m0.078s
user 0m0.116s
sys 0m0.029s


The reported time is a time used by both codice_20 and codice_21 added up. Format of the output can be adjusted using codice_22 variable.

The is not a builtin, but a special keyword, and can&#x27;t be treated as a function or command. It also ignores pipeline redirections (even when executed as codice_9, unless entire Bash is run in &quot;POSIX mode&quot;).

Documentation of this can be accessed using codice_24, or within bash itself using codice_25.

<text>Robert Briton Selby (born March 27, 1945) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers and St. Louis Blues from 1965 to 1971. He also played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) for the Quebec Nordiques, New England Whalers and Toronto Toros from 1972 to 1975.

==Playing career==
Selby started his hockey career with the Toronto Marlboros in the OHA where he played five seasons. Selby got his first taste of a championship win in 1963–64, when the Marlboros swept the Edmonton Oil Kings in 4 games to win their fourth Memorial Cup. In 1964–65, Selby was called up by the Toronto Maple Leafs to replace injured forward Ron Ellis in the NHL. He played 3 games with the Leafs, scoring 2 goals. Selby scored his first NHL goal against the New York Rangers&#x27; Jacques Plante in his first NHL game. Ellis would return and the Leafs sent Selby back down to the juniors.

The following season, Selby had a full-time roster spot with the Leafs. Selby scored a total of 27 points in his rookie season and was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy, for best rookie of the season. His total of 27 points is the lowest scoring total by a Calder-winning forward since 1937–38. Struggling early on the next season, the Leafs sent Selby down to the minors to play with the Vancouver Canucks in the WHL. He played 15 games before injuring his leg, sidelining him out for the remainder of the year. In 1967, the NHL expanded by introducing 6 new teams. Selby was claimed by the Philadelphia Flyers in the Expansion Draft. During his first year with the Flyers, Selby set career highs in goals, assists, and points. The Flyers traded Selby back to his old team, the Maple Leafs, in 1968–69. Selby spent one season with the Leafs, before being traded again, this time to the St. Louis Blues. His stay with the Blues would be short however, as he was sent down to the minors with the Kansas City Blues.

In 1972–73, a newly formed league, the World Hockey Association was created. Selby was selected in the WHA General Player Draft by the Houston Aeros. Seeing an opportunity to jump out of the minors, Selby took it and signed on with the Aeros. Before even playing a game with the Aeros, he was immediately traded to the Quebec Nordiques. After playing only 7 games with the Nordiques, he was quickly traded to the Philadelphia Blazers, who in turn traded him to the New England Whalers. He spent 63 games with the Whalers, winning the Avco World Trophy, the WHA championship. In 1973–74, he was traded to the Toronto Toros, where he would retire.

==Post-playing career==
After his playing career, Selby became a history teacher at North Toronto Collegiate Institute, from which he retired in 2010.

==Awards and achievements==
* Memorial Cup champion in 1964
* Calder Memorial Trophy winner in 1966
* Avco World Trophy champion in 1973

<text>The Nationalist Party of Canada is a Canadian white supremacist organization founded in 1977 by Don Andrews. The party describes itself as white nationalist and is known for its antisemitic and racist publications.
== History ==
The Nationalist Party was founded by Andrews after he was legally barred by his bail conditions from associating with the Western Guard, another white supremacist organization. The party was briefly known as the National Citizens Alliance. It had an estimated 150 to 300 members in the mid-1980s.

From 1977 to 1985, the party published &quot;The Nationalist Report&quot;, which ceased publication when Andrews and Party Secretary Robert Smith were charged and convicted under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; for promoting hatred. Crown attorney Michel Anne MacDonald described the journal as containing anti-black, anti-Jewish and anti-Asian articles, and the presiding judge described the &quot;degree of hatred&quot; in their journal as &quot;obscene&quot;. He added that Andrews was the &quot;directing mind of the publication&quot; and described Smith as a &quot;faithful, industrious follower&quot;.

In 1986, Andrews and Smith endorsed Holocaust denier Jim Keegstra&#x27;s bid to lead the Social Credit Party of Canada. The two men appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1989, seeking to have their conviction overturned. The court rejected the appeal in December 1990, ruling that the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; did not protect hate speech in &quot;R v Andrews&quot; and &quot;R v Keegstra&quot;. Andrews and Smith served jail terms following the ruling.

The Nationalist Party continues to further its goals through supporting such projects as &quot;European Heritage Week&quot; (commemorated every October beginning on the Canadian observance of Thanksgiving) and a shortwave radio program. It also originated and operates the &quot;Canadian Flag Perpetual Pride Campaign&quot; each year during the months of July and December, where residences in cities and towns in Canada, and governments at the federal, provincial and municipal levels are encouraged to properly display new Canadian flags and to replace worn ones; this campaign has been extended to encourage Canadian flag displays at offices and stores of major Canadian corporations such as Canadian Tire, Unilever and Loblaws/Weston.

Andrews has run for Mayor of Toronto several times, including in 2003 when he won 0.17 percent of the vote. In that year, two other party members ran unsuccessfully for Toronto City Council.

== Party candidates ==

=== Bob Smith ===
Robert Wayne Smith is a frequent candidate for political office, and has sought election at the municipal, provincial and federal levels. Like Don Andrews, he was originally a member of the Western Guard Party. He first ran for the Toronto School Board in 1972, when he was still a student. His most recent campaign was for Mayor of Toronto in 2006. During his Western Guard days, he was the voice for its White Power Phone Message. Among organizations he has served in include the Canadian Anti-Soviet Action Committee, the Ontario Social Credit organization, as a director of the Ezra Pound Institute for International Studies, and as a guest commentator during the 1990s for the British Peoples&#x27; League Hour radio program. Today, he regularly blogs at his Internet column on the Nationalist Party website page, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Beat&quot;.

<doc id="576493" wikidata="Q3491146" url="?curid=576493" title="Robert Fulghum">
<text>Robert Lee Fulghum (; born June 4, 1937) is an American author and Unitarian Universalist minister.

==Early career==
He grew up in Waco, Texas and received his Bachelor of Arts at Baylor University in 1958. He received his Bachelor of Divinity at Starr King School for the Ministry in 1961 and was ordained as a Unitarian Universalist minister. Fulghum served the Bellingham Unitarian Fellowship in Bellingham, Washington from 1960 to 1964, and the Edmonds Unitarian Universalist Church in Edmonds, Washington, where he is Minister Emeritus.

==Writing==
Fulghum came to prominence in the United States when his first collection of writings, &quot;All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten&quot; (1988), stayed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller lists for nearly two years. The collection of essays is subtitled &quot;Uncommon Thoughts on Common Things&quot;. A twenty-fifth anniversary edition of &quot;Kindergarten&quot; has been published – updating and revising the original text, with the addition of twenty-five new stories.

There are currently more than 17 million copies of his books in print, published in 27 languages in 103 countries.

==Performances==
Fulghum performed in two television adaptations of his work for PBS, and is a Grammy nominee for the spoken word award. He has been a speaker at numerous colleges, conventions, and public events across the United States and Europe. He has been a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist.

==Novels==
Fulghum wrote a novel in three volumes. The first, &quot;Third Wish&quot;, was continued in &quot;Third Wish II, The Rest of the Story, Almost&quot;, and completed with the third volume, &quot;Third Wish, Granted&quot;. The novel was published in several languages, including English.

His next novel, &quot;If You Love Me Still, Will You Love Me Moving? Tales from the Century Ballroom&quot;, was inspired by Fulghum&#x27;s love of dancing, especially tango, and was first published in Czech (as &quot;Drž mě pevně, miluj mě zlehka&quot;) in 2011.

Eventually, his books of essays were transformed into two stage productions. The first shares the same title as his first book, and was conceived and adapted by Ernest Zulia, with music and lyrics by David Caldwell. The play is based on all eight books, and is an optional musical. The second is entitled &quot;Uh-Oh, Here Comes Christmas&quot;. To date there have been more than 2,000 national and international productions of these plays.

==Personal life==
Fulghum has been married three times. He has four children and six grandchildren. He lives in Moab, Utah, and on the Greek island of Crete.

==Works==
His collections include:
* &quot;All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten&quot;
* &quot;It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It&quot;
* &quot;Uh-Oh: Some Observations from Both Sides of the Refrigerator Door&quot;
*&quot; Maybe (Maybe Not)&quot;
* &quot;From Beginning to End—The Rituals of Our Lives&quot;
* &quot;True Love&quot;
* &quot;Words I Wish I Wrote&quot;

<doc id="576507" wikidata="Q607007" url="?curid=576507" title="Haym Salomon">
<text>Haym Salomon (also Solomon; April 7, 1740 – January 6, 1785) was a Polish-born American merchant best known for his actions during the American Revolution, where he was the prime financier to the Continental Congress. Born in Leszno, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Salomon studied finance in Western Europe before emigrating to New York City in 1775. After the American Revolutionary War broke out in the same year, Salomon supported the Patriots by providing financial services while working alongside Robert Morris, the Superintendent of Finance of the United States. 

He helped convert French loans into hard currency by selling bills of exchange on Morris&#x27; behalf, and also brokered large donations to the Patriot cause. Despite donating his entire fortune to the Continental Army and several Founding Fathers of the United States, Salomon died penniless in Philadelphia in 1785 due to the failure of government officials and private lenders to repay the debt they owed to him.

==Early life and education==

Haym Salomon was born on April 7, 1740 in Leszno, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to a Sephardic Jewish family descended from Spanish and Portuguese Jews who gradually migrated to Poland following the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492. Although most Jews in Central and Eastern Europe spoke Yiddish, it has been claimed that because Salomon left Poland with his family while he was still young, he could not read and write Yiddish; Sephardic Jews typically spoke Judaeo-Spanish, a language based on Hebrew and Spanish, rather than Yiddish. In his youth, he studied Hebrew.

During his adult travels in Western Europe, Salomon acquired a knowledge of finance and fluency in some of the languages of the day. He returned to Poland in 1770 but left for England two years later in the wake of the First Partition of Poland in 1772. In 1775, he immigrated to New York City, where he established himself as a financial broker for American merchants engaged in overseas trade.

==Revolutionary activity==
Sympathizing with the Patriot cause, Salomon joined the New York branch of the Sons of Liberty. In September 1776, he was arrested by the British as a spy, but quickly pardoned. However, the British authorities detained him for 18 months on a boat as an interpreter for Hessian troops, since Salomon could speak German. Salomon used his new position to help prisoners of war from the Continental Army escape, encouraged Hessian troops to desert, and collaborated with Hercules Mulligan and Cato to carry out other acts of espionage. In 1778 Salomon was arrested again, convicted of espionage, and sentenced to death. He eventually escaped and made his way with his family to Philadelphia, where the Continental Congress was located.

===Financing of the American Revolutionary War===

Once resettled in Philadelphia, Salomon resumed his activities as a broker. He became the agent to the French consul as well as the paymaster for all French forces in North America. In 1781, he began working extensively with Robert Morris, the newly appointed Superintendent of Finance of the United States.

From the period from 1781 to 1784, records show Salomon&#x27;s fundraising and personal lending helped provide over $650,000 in financing to General George Washington in his war effort. His most meaningful financial contribution, however, came immediately prior to the Siege of Yorktown.

In August 1781, the Continental Army trapped Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis in the Virginia coastal town of Yorktown. George Washington and the main army, and Count de Rochambeau with his French army, decided to march from the Hudson Highlands to Yorktown and deliver the final blow. But Washington&#x27;s war chest was completely empty, as was that of Congress. Without food, uniforms and supplies, Washington&#x27;s troops were close to mutiny.

Washington determined that he needed at least $20,000 to finance the campaign. When Morris told him there were no funds and no credit available, Washington said: &quot;Send for Haym Salomon&quot;. Salomon raised $20,000, through the sale of bills of exchange. With that contribution, Washington conducted the Yorktown campaign, which proved to be the final battle of the Revolution.

Salomon brokered the sale of a majority of the war aid from France and the Dutch Republic, selling bills of exchange to American merchants. Salomon also personally supported various members of the Continental Congress during their stay in Philadelphia, including James Madison and James Wilson. He requested below-market interest rates, and he never asked for repayment.

Salomon is believed to have granted outright bequests to men who he thought were unsung heroes of the revolution who had become impoverished during the war. One example is Bodo Otto, a senior surgeon in the continental army. Otto joined the army at the age of 65 and served for the entire war. Among other things, he established the hospital at Valley Forge, where he often used his own funds to purchase medical supplies. Due to Salomon&#x27;s bequest, Otto was able to rebuild his medical practice in Reading, Pennsylvania, at war&#x27;s end.

The Treaty of Paris, signed on September 3, 1783, ended the Revolutionary War but not the financial problems of the newly established nation. America&#x27;s war debt to France was never properly repaid, which was part of the cascade of events leading to the French Revolution.

===Jewish community===

Salomon was involved in Jewish community affairs, being a member of Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia, and in 1782 made the largest individual donation toward the construction of its main building. In 1783, Salomon was among the prominent Jews involved in the successful effort to have the Pennsylvania Council of Censors remove the religious test oath required for office-holding under the State Constitution. These test laws were originally written to disenfranchise the Quaker majority (Quakers objected to taking oaths at all), but many were caught up in this anti-democratic ploy. It was Salomon&#x27;s old friend Robert Morris who actually introduced legislation to end the test laws in Pennsylvania. In 1784, Salomon answered antisemitic slander in the press by stating: &quot;I am a Jew; it is my own nation; I do not despair that we shall obtain every other privilege that we aspire to enjoy along with our fellow-citizens.&quot;

=== Freemasonry ===
Like Washington and many prominent men associated with the American revolution, Salomon was a Freemason. He received his first two degrees in Philadelphia&#x27;s Lodge No. 2, Ancient York Rite in 1764. After the war, his Master Mason degree was conferred in 1784 (possibly in Maryland Lodge, No. 27), the year before his death.

==Death==
The financier died suddenly and in poverty on January 6, 1785, in Philadelphia. Due to the failure of governments and private lenders to repay the debt incurred by the war, his family was left penniless at his death at age 44. The hundreds of thousands of dollars of Continental debt Salomon bought with his own fortune were worth only about 10 cents on the dollar when he died.

His obituary in the &quot;Independent Gazetteer&quot; read, &quot;Thursday, last, expired, after a lingering illness, Mr. Haym Salomon, an eminent broker of this city, was a native of Poland, and of the Hebrew nation. He was remarkable for his skill and integrity in his profession, and for his generous and humane deportment. His remains were yesterday deposited in the burial ground of the synagogue of this city.&quot;

==Legacy==

The grave site of Haym Salomon is located in the Mikveh Israel Cemetery in Philadelphia. Though it is unmarked, there are two plaque memorials. The east wall has a marble tablet that was installed by his great-grandson, William Salomon, and a granite memorial is set inside the cemetery gate. In 1980, the Haym Salomon Lodge #663 of the fraternal organization &quot;B&#x27;rith Sholom&quot; sponsored a memorial in the Mikveh Israel Cemetery. A blue ribbon panel and committee, including Robert S. Whitman, Sidney Bruskin and Marvin Abrams, all lodge past presidents; and Philadelphia residents, arranged for the renovation of the walls and walkways of the cemetery. They then arranged for and oversaw the installation of a large, engraved memorial marker of Barre Granite just inside the cemetery gates, inscribed &quot;An American Patriot&quot;. A memorial bronze marker with an American flag was installed by Robert S. Whitman, marking the dedicated space for the American patriot.

===Commemoration===
There is a legend that during the design process of the Great Seal, Washington asked what compensation Salomon wanted in return for his financial contributions to the American Revolutionary War. He replied that &quot;he wanted nothing for himself but that he wanted something for his people&quot;. While there is no evidence, there is a theory that the 13 stars representing the colonies on the seal were arranged in the shape of the Star of David in commemoration of Solomon&#x27;s contributions. This appears to have little basis in fact, however, although it is oft-repeated.

* In 1893, a bill was presented before the 52nd United States Congress ordering a gold medal be struck in recognition of Salomon&#x27;s contributions to the United States.
* In 1939, Warner Brothers released &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, a short film starring Claude Rains as Salomon.
* In 1941, the writer Howard Fast wrote a book &quot;Haym Salomon, Son of Liberty&quot;. That same year, the Heald Square Monument, a sculpture designed by Lorado Taft was erected in today&#x27;s Heald Square in downtown Chicago. Taft began the work but died in 1936. It was completed by his associate, Leonard Crunelle. The monument depicts George Washington flanked by Salomon and Robert Morris and grasping hands with both men.
* In 1946, a memorial statue was erected to Salomon at Hollenbeck Park in Los Angeles. The statue was rededicated in 2008 at Pan-Pacific Park in the Fairfax District, where it can be found on the corner of Gardner and Third Street.
* In 1975, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Haym Salomon for his contributions to the cause of the American Revolution. This stamp, like others in the &quot;Contributors to the Cause&quot; series, was printed on the front and the back. On the glue side of the stamp, the following words were printed in pale green ink: &quot;Financial Hero – Businessman and broker Haym Salomon was responsible for raising most of the money needed to finance the American Revolution and later to save the new nation from collapse&quot;.
* &quot;The Congressional Record&quot; of March 25, 1975 reads:

* In World War II, the United States liberty ship SS &quot;Haym Salomon&quot; was named in his honor. The ship was launched on May 17, 1943. It was sold for private use in 1947 and scrapped in 1971.
* The Haym Salomon Nursing Home in Brooklyn, New York, is named in his honor.
* Haym Salomon Square is located Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, New York City.
* Haym Salomon Memorial Park in Frazer, Pennsylvania, is a Jewish cemetery in suburban Philadelphia. It is the final resting place of musician Jim Croce.
* The Haym Salomon Center is a nonprofit organization located in Northbrook, Illinois, that advocates for pro-Western, pro-democracy values.

<text>Durham tubes are used in microbiology to detect production of gas by microorganisms. They are simply smaller test tubes inserted upside down in another test tube so they are freely movable. The culture media to be tested is then added to the larger tube and sterilized, which also eliminates the initial air gap produced when the tube is inserted upside down. The culture media typically contains a single substance to be tested with the organism, such as to determine whether an organism can ferment a particular carbohydrate. After inoculation and incubation, any gas that is produced will form a visible gas bubble inside the small tube. Litmus solution can also be added to the culture media to give a visual representation of pH changes that occur during the production of gas. The method was first reported in 1898 by British microbiologist Herbert Durham.

One limitation of the Durham tube is that it does not allow for precise determination of the type of gas that is produced within the inner tube, or measurements of the quantity of gas produced. However, Durham argued that quantitive measurements are of limited value because of the culture solution will absorb some of the gas in unknown, variable proportions. Additionally, using Durham tubes to provide evidence of fermentation may not be able to detect slow- or weakly-fermenting organisms when the resultant carbon dioxide diffuses back into the solution as quickly as it is formed, so a negative test using Durham tubes does not indicate decisive physiological significance.

<doc id="576517" wikidata="Q844058" url="?curid=576517" title="Clydesdale horse">
<text>The Clydesdale is a Scottish breed of draught horse. It takes its name from Clydesdale, a region of Scotland centred on the River Clyde.

The origins of the breed lie in the seventeenth century, when Flemish stallions were imported to Scotland and mated with local mares; in the nineteenth century, Shire blood was introduced. The first recorded use of the name &quot;Clydesdale&quot; for the breed was in 1826; the horses spread through much of Scotland and into northern England. After the breed society was formed in 1877, thousands of Clydesdales were exported to many countries of the world, particularly to Australia and New Zealand. In the early twentieth century numbers began to fall, both because many were taken for use in the First World War, and because of the increasing mechanisation of agriculture. By the 1970s, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust considered the breed vulnerable to extinction. Numbers have since increased slightly.

It is a large and powerful horse, although now not as heavy as in the past. It was traditionally used for draught power, both in farming and in road haulage. It is now principally a carriage horse. It may be ridden or driven in parades or processions. In the United States the Anheuser-Busch brewery uses a matched team of eight for publicity.

== History ==
The Clydesdale horse takes its name from Clydesdale, the valley of the River Clyde. In the late seventeenth century, stallions of Friesian and Flemish stock from the Low Countries were imported to Scotland and bred to local mares. These included a black unnamed stallion imported from England by a John Paterson of Lochlyloch and an unnamed dark-brown stallion owned by the Duke of Hamilton.

Another prominent stallion was a coach horse stallion of unknown lineage named Blaze. Written pedigrees were kept of these foals beginning in the early nineteenth century, and in 1806, a filly, later known as &quot;Lampits mare&quot; after the farm name of her owner, was born that traced her lineage to the black stallion. This mare is listed in the ancestry of almost every Clydesdale living today. One of her foals was Thompson&#x27;s Black Horse (known as Glancer), which was to have a significant influence on the Clydesdale breed.

The first recorded use of the name &quot;Clydesdale&quot; in reference to the breed was in 1826 at an exhibition in Glasgow. Another theory of their origin, that of them descending from Flemish horses brought to Scotland as early as the 15th century, was also promulgated in the late 18th century. However, even the author of that theory admitted that the common story of their ancestry is more likely.

A system of hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records dating back to 1837. This programme consisted of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize. The owner was then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares. Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England.

Through extensive crossbreeding with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same. In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA), which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts. The first American stud book was published in 1882. In 1883, the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded to compete with the Clydesdale Horse Society. It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed, who also were responsible in large part for the introduction of Shire blood into the Clydesdale.

Large numbers of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with 1617 stallions leaving the country in 1911 alone. Between 1884 and 1945, export certificates were issued for 20,183 horses. These horses were exported to other countries in the British Empire, as well as North and South America, continental Europe, and Russia.

The First World War had the conscription of thousands of horses for the war effort, and after the war, breed numbers declined as farms became increasingly mechanised. This decline continued between the wars. Following the Second World War, the number of Clydesdale breeding stallions in England dropped from more than 200 in 1946 to 80 in 1949. By 1975, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust considered them vulnerable to extinction, meaning fewer than 900 breeding females remained in the UK.
Many of the horses exported from Scotland in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries went to Australia and New Zealand. In 1918, the Commonwealth Clydesdale Horse Society was formed as the association for the breed in Australia. Between 1906 and 1936, Clydesdales were bred so extensively in Australia that other draught breeds were almost unknown. By the late 1960s, it was noted that &quot;Excellent Clydesdale horses are bred in Victoria and New Zealand; but, at least in the former place, it is considered advisable to keep up the type by frequent importations from England.&quot; Over 25,000 Clydesdales were registered in Australia between 1924 and 2008. The popularity of the Clydesdale led to it being called &quot;the breed that built Australia&quot;.

=== Conservation status ===

In the 1990s, numbers began to rise. By 2005, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust had moved the breed to &quot;at risk&quot; status, meaning that there were fewer than 1,500 breeding females in the UK. By 2010 it had been moved back to &quot;vulnerable&quot;.

In 2010, the worldwide Clydesdale horse population was estimated to be 5,000, with around 4,000 in the United States and Canada, 800 in the UK, and the rest in other countries, including Russia, Japan, Germany, and South Africa.. The same year, the Clydesdale was listed as &quot;watch&quot; by The Livestock Conservancy, meaning that fewer than 2500 horses were registered annually in the USA, and there were fewer than 10,000 worldwide. By 2024, the Clydesdale was listed as &quot;threatened&quot; (&lt;1,000 annual US registrations and &lt;5,000 global population). According to The Livestock Conservancy, &quot;The North American population of Clydesdale horses had increased steadily for several decades, but a sharp decline began around 2010, prompted by the economic downturn that affected the entire equine market. Globally, the breed is well-known, but not common, with an estimated global population of fewer than 5,000 horses.&quot;

Inbreeding has also become an issue for the breed, and a 2013 study found that the Clydesdale had one of the highest inbreeding coefficients among all horse breeds.

== Characteristics ==
The conformation of the Clydesdale has changed greatly throughout its history. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was a compact horse smaller than the Shire, Percheron, and Belgian Draught. Beginning in the 1940s, breeding animals were selected to produce taller horses that looked more impressive in parades and shows. Today, the Clydesdale stands high and weighs . Some mature males are larger, standing taller than 183 cm and weighing up to . The breed has a straight facial profile or a slight Roman nose, broad forehead, and wide muzzle.

It is well-muscled and strong, with an arched neck, high withers, and a sloped shoulder. Breed associations pay close attention to the quality of the hooves and legs, as well as the general movement. Their gaits are active, with clearly lifted hooves and a general impression of power and quality. Clydesdales are energetic, with a manner described by the Clydesdale Horse Society as a &quot;gaiety of carriage and outlook&quot;.
Clydesdales are usually bay or brown in colour. Roans are common, and black, grey and chestnut also occur. Most have white markings, including white on the face, feet, and legs, and occasional white patches on the body (generally on the lower belly). They have extensive feathering on their lower legs. Cow hocks, where the hocks turn inward are a breed characteristic and not a fault.

Many buyers pay a premium for bay and black horses, especially those with four white legs and white facial markings. Specific colours are often preferred over other physical traits, and some buyers even choose horses with soundness problems if they have the desired colour and markings. Buyers do not favour Sabino-like horses, despite one draught-breed writer theorising that they are needed to keep the desired coat colours and texture. Breed associations, however, state that no colour is bad, and that horses with roaning and body spots are increasingly accepted.

Clydesdales have been identified to be at risk for chronic progressive lymphedema, a disease with clinical signs that include progressive swelling, hyperkeratosis, and fibrosis of distal limbs that is similar to chronic lymphedema in humans. Another health concern is a skin condition on the lower leg where feathering is heavy. Colloquially called &quot;Clyde&#x27;s itch&quot;, it is thought to be caused by a type of mange. Clydesdales are also known to develop sunburn on any pink (unpigmented) skin around their faces.

== Uses ==

The Clydesdale was originally used for agriculture, hauling coal in Lanarkshire, and heavy hauling in Glasgow. Today, Clydesdales are still used for draught purposes, including agriculture, logging, and driving. They are also shown and ridden, as well as kept for pleasure. Clydesdales are known to be the popular breed choice with carriage services and parade horses because of their white, feathered legs.

Along with carriage horses, Clydesdales are also used as show horses. They are shown in lead line and harness classes at county and state fairs, as well as national exhibitions. 
Some of the most famous members of the breed are the teams that make up the hitches of the Budweiser Clydesdales. The Budweiser Brewery first formed these teams at the end of Prohibition, and they have since become an international symbol of both the breed and the brand. The Budweiser breeding programme, with its strict standards of colour and conformation, have influenced the look of the breed in the United States to the point that many people believe that Clydesdales are always bay with white markings.

== Influence on other breeds ==

In the second half of the 1800s, Clydesdale and Shire blood was added to the Irish Draught breed in an attempt to reinvigorate that declining breed. However, those efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg faults, such as tied-in below the knee.

The Australian Draught horse was created using European draft breeds, including the Clydesdale, imported in the late 1800s.

In the early 1900s it was considered profitable to breed Clydesdale stallions to Dales Pony mares to create a mid-sized draught horses for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery. Unfortunately, after just a few years, the Dales breed was two-thirds Clydesdale. They started a breed registry in 1916 to preserve the Dales, and by 1923 the Army was buying only Dales with no signs of carthorse blood. The modern Dales shows no signs of Clydesdale characteristics.

The Clydesdale contributed to the development of the Gypsy horse in Great Britain along with Friesian, Shire and Dale, although no written records were kept.

<text>Visual release hallucinations, also known as Charles Bonnet syndrome or CBS, are a type of psychophysical visual disturbance in which a person with partial or severe blindness experiences visual hallucinations.

First described by Charles Bonnet in 1760,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vukicevic/Fitzmaurice&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;Charles Bonnet syndrome&quot; was first introduced into English-speaking psychiatry in 1982. A related type of hallucination that also occurs with lack of visual input is the closed-eye hallucination.

==Signs and symptoms==
People with significant vision loss may have vivid recurrent visual hallucinations (fictive visual percepts). One characteristic of these hallucinations is that they usually are &quot;lilliputian&quot; (hallucinations in which the characters or objects are smaller than normal). Depending on the content, visual hallucinations can be classified as either simple or complex. Simple visual hallucinations are commonly characterized by shapes, photopsias, and grid-like patterns. Complex visual hallucinations consist of highly detailed representations of people and objects. The most common hallucination is of faces or cartoons. Those affected understand that the hallucinations are not real, and the hallucinations are only visual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mogk/Riddering/Dahl/Bruce/Brafford&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Visual hallucinations generally appear when the eyes are open, fading once the visual gaze shifts. It is widely claimed that sensory deprivation is instrumental in the progression of CBS. During episodes of inactivity, hallucinations are more likely to occur. The majority of those with CBS describe the duration of hallucinations to continue for up to a few minutes, multiple times a day or week.

Even though people of all ages may be affected by Charles Bonnet syndrome, those within the age range of 70 to 80 are primarily affected. Among older adults (&gt; 65 years) with significant vision loss, the prevalence of Charles Bonnet syndrome has been reported to be between 10% and 40%; a 2008 Australian study found the prevalence to be 17.5%. Two Asian studies, however, report a much lower prevalence. The high incidence of underreporting this disorder is the greatest hindrance to determining the exact prevalence. Underreporting is thought to be a result of those with the condition being afraid to discuss the symptoms out of fear that they will be labeled of unsound mind.

== Pathophysiology ==

There is no general consensus on the definition of CBS. Predominant factors correlated with CBS are a decrease of visual acuity, visual field loss, and elderly age. While characteristic features of visual hallucinations are not specifically linked to the anatomical site of the ocular injury, they usually match to the location of visual loss. The most commonly accepted theory for Charles Bonnet syndrome proposes that extreme visual impairment promotes sensory deafferentation, leading to disinhibition, thus resulting in sudden neural firings of the visual cortical regions. A few studies record that visual hallucinations are likely to be concentrated in the blind regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of Charles Bonnet syndrome patients displays a relationship between visual hallucinations and activity in the ventral occipital lobe. A connection between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and colored visual hallucinations has been presented. Color vision signals travel through the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), later transmitting down the color regions of the ventral visual pathway. Due to cone photoreceptor damage located in the macula, there is a significant reduction of visual input to the visual association cortex, stirring endogenous activation in the color areas and thus leading to colored hallucinations. Patients with CBS alongside macular degeneration exhibit hyperactivity in the color areas of the visual association cortex (as shown in fMRIs). Those who have significant ocular disease yet maintain visual acuity may still be susceptible to CBS.

The Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) is a way of utilizing an undirected probabilistic process in a neural framework. Researchers argue that the DBM has the ability to model features of cortical learning, perception, and the visual cortex (the locus of visual hallucinations). Compelling evidence details the role homeostatic operations in the cortex play in regards to stabilizing neuronal activity. By using the DBM, researchers show that when sensory input is absent, neuron excitability is influenced, thus potentially triggering complex hallucinations.
A short-term change in the levels of feedforward and feedback flows of information may intensely affect the presence of hallucinations. In periods of drowsiness, CBS related hallucinations are more prone to arise. Disrupting cortical homeostatic processes after vision has been lost may prevent or setback the emergence of hallucinations. At varying stages of the cortical grading, acetylcholine (ACh) may impact the balance of thalamic and intracortical inputs as well as the balance in between bottom-up and top-down. Particularly in CBS, a shortage of acetylcholine at cortical locations should correspond to the onset of hallucinations.

The syndrome can also develop after bilateral optic nerve damage due to methyl alcohol poisoning.

== Diagnosis ==
A variety of disciplines including optometry, ophthalmology, geriatric medicine, psychiatry, and neurology play a part in securing the diagnosis of CBS. Since CBS is not commonly recognized by all clinicians, it oftentimes goes misdiagnosed and identified as psychosis, delirium, or dementia. As a result of this, it is estimated that almost 60% of CBS patients hesitate to notify their physicians. By focusing on the specific type of visual hallucination, one may find an accurate diagnosis. If a patient presents symptoms indicative of Charles Bonnet syndrome, basic laboratory examinations like metabolic panel and blood count tests, as well as neuroimaging, may aid in an accurate diagnosis.

==Treatment==
There is no treatment of proven effectiveness for CBS. For those experiencing CBS, knowing that they have this syndrome and not a mental illness seems to be the most comforting treatment so far, as it improves their ability to cope with the hallucinations. Pharmacologic management including antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizes have been used in cases with varying results. Due to inconsistent results and associated medication side effects, non-pharmacologic management such as reassurance is currently preferred. Furthermore, treatment of underlying conditions that caused the visual loss could also remove or improve CBS associated symptoms. Those experiencing severe symptoms can also utilize behavior techniques such as repeated blinking during hallucinations, rapid eye movement from one object to another and bright lighting to engage the visual neural pathways. Lastly, social isolation, especially in the elderly has also been postulated as a possible etiological factor for CBS and therefore engaging with other individuals could also help alleviate CBS related symptoms.

==Prognosis==
As time passes from the initial onset of visual hallucinations, studies show that around 60% of those living with CBS feel that visual hallucinations have no effect on their lives, 33% of people feel that the hallucinations are disruptive to their lives, and 7% of people even find pleasure in the hallucinations.

A large proportion of those with CBS develop the visual hallucinations as vision begins to deteriorate and stop hallucinating once vision is entirely gone. Complex hallucinations may progress over time if the primary loss of vision is due to damage of the early cortical areas. If activation of the early cortical areas is suppressed when CBS symptoms have already been exhibited, hallucinations may temporarily terminate. Also, interrupting vision for a short time by closing the eyes or blinking may be helpful.

It is possible for a stressful life event to alter the disposition of hallucinatory experiences as well as the emotional experiences (from unconcerning to concerning) in CBS. As expressed in some patients, an interplay between CBS and an acute or post-traumatic stress disorder may exist. The role that trauma plays in CBS may affect how and when a hallucinatory episode is triggered.

==History==

The disease was first noted by the Swiss naturalist Charles Bonnet, who described the condition in 1760. He documented it in his 90-year-old grandfather who was nearly blind from cataracts in both eyes. After Bonnet&#x27;s grandfather received bilateral cataract surgery, his vision evolved from slightly better to complete deterioration over time. It was around this period that his visual hallucinations started. His hallucinations consisted of perceptions of men, women, birds, carriages, buildings, tapestries, physically impossible circumstances and scaffolding patterns. Even though his health was in good shape and he had an absence of any psychiatric disorders, the source of the hallucinations remained unknown. At forty years old, Charles Bonnet himself developed an unrevealed cause of severe vision loss and experienced the hallucinations.

In 1936, Jean Lhermitte and Julian de Ajuriaguerra, concluded that visual hallucinations consist of thalamic lesions as well as ocular pathology.

In 1967, French-Swiss neurologist, Georges de Morsier, coined the term &quot;Charles Bonnet syndrome&quot; in Bonnet&#x27;s honor. De Morsier&#x27;s description of CBS implies a concentrated neurodegeneration, usually occurring in the elderly with typical cognition. In psychiatric literature, the most commonly accepted interpretation of CBS is that of Gold and Rabins&#x27;. In 1989, they detailed that the hallucinations associated with CBS are not affecting other sensory modalities. They believed that the visual hallucinations are oftentimes stereotyped, persistent, and/or repetitive in nature.

==Society and culture==

The syndrome is discussed in:

<text>Three Days Grace is a Canadian rock band formed in Norwood, Ontario, in 1992 originally as Groundswell. Groundswell played in various local Norwood backyard parties and area establishments before disbanding in 1995 and regrouping in 1997 under its current name.

Based in Toronto, the band&#x27;s original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer and backing vocalist Neil Sanderson, and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, Barry Stock was recruited as the band&#x27;s lead guitarist, making them a quartet. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by Walst&#x27;s younger brother Matt, who was a longtime songwriter for the band and was previously the lead singer of My Darkest Days. In 2024, Gontier officially rejoined the band with Walst also remaining as a singer, making them a dual-vocalist band, as well as a quintet for the first time since their genesis as Groundswell.

Currently signed to RCA Records, they have released seven studio albums: &quot;Three Days Grace&quot; in 2003, &quot;One-X&quot; in 2006, &quot;Life Starts Now&quot; in 2009, &quot;Transit of Venus&quot; in 2012, &quot;Human&quot; in 2015, &quot;Outsider&quot; in 2018 and &quot;Explosions&quot; in 2022. The first three albums have been RIAA certified 2× platinum, 3× platinum, and platinum, respectively, in the United States. In Canada, they have been certified by Music Canada as platinum, triple platinum, and double platinum, respectively. In the United Kingdom, their second album &quot;One-X&quot; was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry and gold by the Recorded Music NZ. The band has 18 No. 1 songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and 3 No. 1 hits on Alternative Songs.

== History ==

=== 1992–2002: Early years ===

The band started out as a quintet named &quot;Groundswell&quot; in Norwood, Ontario, in 1992. Groundswell released one full-length album, &quot;Wave of Popular Feeling&quot; in 1995, containing singles &quot;Eddie&quot;, &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; and &quot;Stare&quot;. The band&#x27;s line-up consisted of lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer Neil Sanderson, bassist Brad Walst, lead guitarist Phil Crowe, and rhythm guitarist Joe Grant. Most of the members were attending high school when the band formed. By the end of 1997, the band had broken up.

In 1997, Gontier, Sanderson, and Walst regrouped as &quot;Three Days Grace&quot;. According to Gontier, the name refers to a sense of urgency, with the question being whether someone could change something in their life if they had only three days to make a change. Once in Toronto, the band became acquainted with local producer Gavin Brown. They gave him several years&#x27; worth of material which they had created, and he &quot;...picked out what he called &#x27;the golden nuggets&#x27;&quot;, according to Gontier. Brown and the band polished the songs and created a demo album, which they gave to EMI Music Publishing Canada. The record label wanted to hear more material, and with Brown producing, the band created the song, &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot;, which attracted the interest of several record labels. Three Days Grace were soon signed to Jive Records after being sought out by the company&#x27;s then-president Barry Weiss. Additionally, the group signed with Zomba in 2002.

=== 2003–2005: &quot;Three Days Grace&quot; ===

They moved to Long View Farm, a studio in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, to record their debut album. The group completed half of the album at Long View, while the rest was done at Bearsville Studios in Bearsville, New York. The self-titled album was finished in Woodstock, New York and released on July 22, 2003. To support the eponymous album, the band released their first single, &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot; (the song whose demo had gotten the band a record deal) on April 28, 2003. The song received heavy airplay and rapidly became widely recognizable, and was labelled as the band&#x27;s &quot;breakout hit&quot;. The song peaked at No. 1 on the Canadian rock chart becoming their first number-one hit in the country. Gavin Brown who produced the track, earned the group a Juno Award for Producer of the Year in 2004. In 2003, the group was named &quot;Favourite New Artist&quot; at the CASBY Awards.

In support of their major label debut, the group joined Trapt as an opening act on a US tour from July to September 2003. In late 2003, Barry Stock joined the group after the band was auditioning for a second guitar player. Stock was introduced to the group by his manager in Toronto after they needed some help with their gear. The group joined Nickelback on The Long Road Tour between October and November 2003. The group embarked on a headlining tour called the Three Days Grace World Tour throughout 2004. They also joined Evanescence on a North American Tour in July 2004, as well as Hoobastank on the Let it Out Tour in November. The album peaked at No. 9 on the Canadian Albums Chart and No. 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified platinum in Canada by MC, 2× Platinum in the US by the RIAA, and gold by the Recorded Music NZ. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Just Like You&quot; was released on March 29, 2004. The song became the first of many of the band&#x27;s songs to top the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Airplay and Mainstream Rock charts. &quot;Home&quot; was released on October 4, 2004, as the third single from the album. The fourth and final single &quot;Wake Up&quot; was released exclusively in Canada on January 10, 2005. 

&quot;Three Days Grace&quot; was met with mixed-to-favourable reviews. Dave Doray of IGN said of the album, &quot;Almost every single song from the &quot;Three Days Grace&quot; track list is heavy and catchy, with chewy chunks of assurance and fury thrown in for added measure.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares criticized the album for its simplicity, but praised the groups &quot;tight songwriting&quot; and &quot;unexpectedly pretty choruses&quot; that make them standout among their peers. However, &quot;Spin&quot; gave a negative review calling it, &quot;generic Canadian gripe rock.&quot;

The band performed at the 2004 MuchMusic Video Awards. At the event, &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Video, as well as the band themselves for Favourite Canadian Group. They were nominated for New Group of the Year at the 2004 Juno Awards. The group was also nominated for Modern Rock Artist of the Year at the 2004 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. The band appeared as themselves in the 2004 film &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot;.

=== 2006–2008: &quot;One-X&quot; ===
Around this time, Gontier developed an addiction to the prescription drug OxyContin. After finishing the tour for their first album, the band knew they could not continue with the condition he was in, so in 2005, with the support of his family, friends, and band members, Gontier checked himself into the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto. While in treatment, Gontier began writing lyrics for songs regarding how he felt and what he was going through in rehabilitation.

Gontier successfully completed treatment at CAMH. The band found a place suitable for further songwriting in Northern Ontario, in a cottage where they experimented on, tested, and practiced new songs. After three months at the cottage, they had about finished what would be their second album. Gontier contributed lyrics about his experiences in rehab; the first single from &quot;One-X&quot;, titled &quot;Animal I Have Become&quot;, features lyrics Gontier had written while getting sober. In a 2006 interview, Gontier said that the album&#x27;s material was more personal to him than the band&#x27;s previous work because the inspiration had come out of his experiences with despondence, drug abuse, and rehab, which had constituted the past two years of his life.

&quot;One-X&quot; was released on June 13, 2006, and was produced by Howard Benson. This also marked Stock&#x27;s first effort with the band. The album peaked at No. 2 on the Canadian Albums Chart and at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 78,000 copies in the US in its first week of release. Instead of participating in Narcotics Anonymous, Gontier launched the &quot;Three Days to Change&quot; tour doing free concerts at treatment centres, shelters, group homes and detention centres across North America. In November 2006, Gontier performed with the band at a special show at the CAMH in Toronto, where he had gone for his own rehab. Following the performance, Gontier fielded questions from the audience. CAMH footage, interviews and live performances were filmed as part of the &quot;Behind the Pain&quot; documentary.

&quot;Animal I Have Become&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;One-X&quot; on April 10, 2006, and became one of Three Days Grace&#x27;s most successful singles, becoming 2006&#x27;s most played rock song in Canada. The song won Rock Single of the Year at the 2006 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. &quot;Pain&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on September 19, and topped the Canada Rock Chart becoming the group&#x27;s second number-one on the chart. It also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Airplay and Mainstream Rock charts. &quot;Never Too Late” was released as the third single on May 7, 2007. It was nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards. &quot;Riot&quot; was released as the fourth and final single on November 6, 2007, and reached the top 20 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The album helped Three Days Grace become the No. 1 rock artist by airplay in the US and Canada in 2007, with &quot;Billboard&quot; ranking them as Rock Artist of the Year. In 2007, &quot;One-X&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year at the Juno Awards. The album was certified triple platinum in both Canada and the US, silver in the UK, and gold in New Zealand. Three Days Grace toured the US and Canada throughout the second half of 2006 and all of 2007 in support of &quot;One-X&quot; with Staind. The band also supported Nickelback on their All the Right Reasons Tour from February to March 2007. In early 2008, they toured across the US alongside Seether and Breaking Benjamin. A recording of a concert from the tour, &quot;Live at the Palace 2008&quot;, was released on August 19, 2008.

=== 2009–2011: &quot;Life Starts Now&quot; ===
Writing for the third album began on the road in 2007. Pre-production for the album began in January 2009 and recording for their third album started in March at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Los Angeles, again with producer Howard Benson who had worked with them on their previous releases. The album, entitled &quot;Life Starts Now&quot;, was released on September 22, 2009. Critics as well as band members have noted the album&#x27;s departure from the angry tone of the band&#x27;s previous releases into a lyrical style that is perceived as more optimistic. Gontier stated that the album had a little bit more hope than their previous records. This album reflects the maturity of the band members as they overcome problems such as sickness and death within their families; in a published statement, they were quoted as saying: &quot;We had to be inspired by it, but the outcome is this: It&#x27;s a new beginning. It&#x27;s life starting over.&quot; According to Stock, the album&#x27;s theme centres around &quot;a new sense of freshness&quot; and the idea that &quot;you don&#x27;t have to be stuck in whatever it is you&#x27;re dealing with. Whether it&#x27;s good or bad, it&#x27;s your choice to make a change&quot;.

&quot;Life Starts Now&quot; debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest chart position to date, and sold 79,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with mostly positive reviews. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; gave the album a negative review calling the album &quot;shallow&quot; and criticized it for sounding the same as their previous records. According to AllMusic, &quot;Life Starts Now&quot; &quot;...continues the theme of &quot;One-X&quot;, Gontier&#x27;s personal demons, but with a &#x27;hint of sunlight&#x27;.&quot; He complimented the album, however, saying it served &quot;a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary, mid-tempo rockers&quot;. The album was nominated for Rock Album of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards, but lost to &quot;Billy Talent III&quot;.

The first single from the album, &quot;Break&quot;, was released on September 1, 2009. The song topped the US Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs chart for twelve weeks. It was nominated for Best Post Production Video and Best Rock Video of the Year at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards. &quot;The Good Life&quot; was released on February 9, 2010, as the second single from the album. The song reached number one for six weeks on the US Hot &amp; Rock Alternative Songs chart. &quot;World So Cold&quot; was released as the third single on August 3, 2010. The song peaked at number one on the US Mainstream Rock chart for five weeks. &quot;Lost in You&quot; was released on February 1, 2011, as the fourth and final single from the album. The song won the Pop/Rock Music Award at the 2012 SOCAN Awards. In support of the record, the band embarked on the Life Starts Now Tour, with 20 Canadian shows lasting through November and December 2009 and U.S. shows in January–February 2010. They were joined by Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf during the U.S. shows.

They went on tour with Nickelback and Buckcherry on the Dark Horse Fall 2010 Tour and they later toured with My Darkest Days starting in March 2011. The album was certified double platinum in Canada and platinum the US. In 2011, they were nominated for Group of the Year, as well as their single &quot;Break&quot; for Recording Engineer of the Year at the Juno Awards.

=== 2012–2013: &quot;Transit of Venus&quot; and Gontier&#x27;s departure ===
On October 7, 2011, the RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista and J Records, and moving all the artists signed to the three labels to its RCA Records brand, which included Three Days Grace.

On June 5, 2012, the same day as Venus&#x27; visible transit across the sun, the band announced that their fourth studio album would be called &quot;Transit of Venus&quot; and released on October 2, 2012. They created an early promotional video on their website featuring clips of them in the studio as well as footage of the physical transit of Venus. Due to the rarity of this occurrence, they created the slogan, &quot;Some things will never happen again in your lifetime&quot;, reflecting both this uncommon occurrence as well as the mood that the lyrics and music would most likely take on. The album was produced by Don Gilmore and recorded at Revolution Studios in Toronto. The band took a different approach on this album heading into the studio. They spent three and a half months working and writing songs, where in the past, the songs were already written and they only had to spend a month in the studio recording. Sanderson stated they &quot;went for a tighter and more articulated sound on this record,&quot; experimenting with new instruments.

&quot;Transit of Venus&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the Canadian Albums Chart and was certified gold in Canada. The album also peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album reached number one on the US Top Hard Rock Albums chart. The first single from the album, &quot;Chalk Outline&quot;, was released on August 14. The song peaked at number one on the US Mainstream Rock chart for thirteen weeks. &quot;The High Road&quot; was released on January 22, 2013, as the second single from album. &quot;Misery Loves My Company&quot; was released as the third and final single on May 14, 2013. Both singles also topped the US Mainstream Rock chart. The album was nominated for Rock Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2014.

On January 9, 2013, Three Days Grace announced that Gontier had left the band. They described Gontier&#x27;s departure as being abrupt and unexplained. The departure came just weeks before a co-headlining tour with Shinedown. Gontier explained that he was simply ready to start a new chapter in his life, stating, &quot;After twenty years of being part of an ever evolving band, I have been inspired by life, to move on and to continue to evolve on my own terms.&quot; He later added that his decision for leaving the group was of creative differences. Following his departure from the band, Gontier launched his Solo Live Tour in 2013. After staying out of the spotlight in 2014, Gontier re-emerged in 2015 with rock supergroup Saint Asonia. Brad Walst&#x27;s brother, Matt (of My Darkest Days), became the band&#x27;s new lead singer and they commenced their 2013 tour with Shinedown and P.O.D. Dani Rosenoer, the band&#x27;s touring keyboardist and backing vocalist since 2012, also joined the band for the tour.

=== 2014–2017: &quot;Human&quot; ===
The group began recording their fifth studio album in late 2013 in Noble Street Studios, Toronto. The group also confirmed in March 2014, that Walst would officially be taking over as the band&#x27;s new frontman. They worked with producer Gavin Brown on this album. Sanderson described the album as more raw and aggressive than their previous records. The group embarked on a US tour from April to July 2014. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Brad Walst stated that the album was almost complete and confirmed it would be released the following year. Walst also added that the group went back to their hard rock roots for this album. In a separate interview with Loudwire, Brad credited Brown for &quot;getting them in the right mindset.&quot;

A new track titled &quot;Painkiller&quot; was released on April 1, 2014, as the lead single from the album. It was the first song they wrote with Matt. The song reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock chart, which made it their eleventh number-one single. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;I Am Machine&quot; was released on September 30, 2014. The song was nominated for Rock Song of the Year at the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Awards. On January 26, 2015, it was revealed that the new album would be titled &quot;Human&quot;. On March 23, &quot;Human Race&quot; was released as the third single. &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; was released on September 15, as the fourth and final single.

&quot;Human&quot; was released on March 31, 2015. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Canadian Albums Chart and sold 6,700 copies first week. The album was certified gold in Canada. It peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also topped the US Top Hard Rock Albums chart for two weeks. It was nominated for Rock Album of the Year at the 2015 Loudwire Music Awards. The band embarked on the Human Tour in Canada and the US from July to November 2015 to support the album. Halestorm supported most of the Canadian dates. The band toured Europe and Russia in early 2016.

They were nominated for the 2016 Juno Award for Group of the Year. On November 18, 2016, Three Days Grace released a cover of the Phantogram song &quot;You Don&#x27;t Get Me High Anymore&quot;.

=== 2017–2020: &quot;Outsider&quot; ===

Once the tour for their 2015 album &quot;Human&quot; concluded, the band decided to take time off to work on the next album &quot;in as much isolation as possible,&quot; according to drummer Neil Sanderson. They spent one year writing the material at rural properties owned by Sanderson and Brad Walst. Matt Walst was much more involved in the songwriting, messages, and concepts on this album compared to their previous one. The band began recording their sixth studio album in July 2017. The album was produced by two of the band&#x27;s prior producers, Gavin Brown and Howard Benson but also by members of the band themselves. Having written and recorded around 20 songs, the band selected each track &quot;based on vibe,&quot; so the album could &quot;have a good sequence to it&quot; according to Walst. Their sixth studio album titled, &quot;Outsider&quot; was announced on January 25, 2018, and released the lead single, &quot;The Mountain&quot; with an accompanying music video that same day. The song peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart in March 2018 and became their 13th number-one on the chart while tying the record with Van Halen.

The album was released on March 9, 2018. The album debuted at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 17,000 copies in its first week in the US. On June 12, &quot;Infra-Red&quot; was released as the band&#x27;s second single from the album. &quot;Infra-Red&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Songs chart and it is their 14th number-one single. With this achievement, the band broke Van Halen&#x27;s two-decade record of topping the chart. On November 13, 2018, &quot;Right Left Wrong&quot; was released as the band&#x27;s third single from the album. It peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Songs chart and it is their 15th number-one single. In support of the album&#x27;s release, the group embarked on the Outsider Tour in 2018 across Europe and North America. The group also toured with Avenged Sevenfold and Prophets of Rage on the End of the World Tour. On March 14, 2019, the band won Rock Artist of the Year on 2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards.

Three Days Grace were nominated for three Juno Awards in 2019, &quot;Outsider&quot; for Album of the Year and Rock Album of the Year and the band for Group of the Year. They won the Rock Songwriters of the Year award for &quot;The Mountain&quot; in the 30th anniversary of the SOCAN Awards. On July 23, 2020, the band released a cover of Gotye&#x27;s &quot;Somebody That I Used to Know&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Right Left Wrong&quot; won the Rock Music Award provided by SOCAN.

=== 2021–2023: &quot;Explosions&quot;===

The group began writing their seventh studio album in February 2020. On March 1, 2021, the band confirmed that they were in the studio recording their album on Instagram. According to Brad Walst, the group had recorded nine or ten songs separately, in different studios, by themselves. Sanderson stated that the album was inspired by the real life circumstances the band had gone through over the last several years.

On November 29, 2021, the band released a new single called &quot;So Called Life&quot; as the first single from their seventh studio album, &quot;Explosions&quot;, which was released on May 6, 2022. The song reached the &quot;Billboard &quot;Mainstream Rock chart at number one, topping the chart for four consecutive weeks. Three months later, on February 17, 2022, the band released a promotional single, titled &quot;Neurotic&quot;, featuring Lukas Rossi. On April 11, 2022, the band released &quot;Lifetime&quot; as the album&#x27;s second radio single. The song was dedicated to the people of Mayfield, Kentucky, after an EF4 tornado hit the city in December 2021. It peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. This marks the band&#x27;s 17th number-one song on the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart. On September 27, 2022, &quot;I Am the Weapon&quot;, the third single from the album was released for radio airplay. The song peaked at number four on the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart.

They were nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 2022 for &quot;So Called Life&quot;. They were also nominated at the 2023 iHeartRadio Music Awards for Rock Artist of the Year and &quot;So Called Life&quot; for Rock Song of the Year. &quot;Explosions&quot; was nominated for Rock Album Of The Year at the 2023 Juno Awards.

The group went on the Explosions Tour in North America during the summer and fall of 2022. In April and May 2023, the band supported Shinedown on their The Revolutions Tour. During the April 19, 2023, show in Huntsville, Alabama, Adam Gontier reunited with the band for a brief collaborative performance. During the tour, Shaun Foist of Breaking Benjamin temporarily filled in for Sanderson, who sprained his ankle. The group co-headlined a tour alongside Chevelle in the fall of 2023 with support from Loathe. Gontier reunited with the band a second time during their October 10, 2023, show in Nashville, Tennessee, where he has relocated after leaving Three Days Grace.

=== 2024–present: Gontier&#x27;s return and upcoming eighth studio album ===

On October 2, 2024, the band revealed via social media that they were in the studio with Gontier teasing a possibility of new music in the works, posting a video with the caption ending &quot;Three Days Grace 2X.&quot; The following day, Three Days Grace confirmed that Gontier had returned to the band full-time, with Walst remaining a lead vocalist as well, making them a two-vocal band. The band confirmed that new music and a new tour were also to follow. The group are set to join Disturbed in March 2025 on The Sickness 25th Anniversary Tour. They were also scheduled to perform at the Sick New World Fest in April 2025, before the event was canceled in November 2024. The band also announced that they will play at Inkcarceration Festival in July 2025.

On November 20, the band announced a new single, titled &quot;Mayday&quot;, which was released on November 22, 2024. The topped the Canada Rock chart, as well as peaking at number one the US Mainstream Rock chart, becoming their eighteenth number-one song on the chart. Shortly after the song&#x27;s release, Sanderson told WRIF that they were almost done completing their eighth studio album. He also said the group hoped to finish writing their album by the end of the year, as well as recording their album in January 2025 and have it released later that year.

== Musical styles and influences ==

Three Day&#x27;s Grace&#x27;s music has been described as post-grunge, hard rock, alternative rock, alternative metal, and nu metal. The band&#x27;s image has been mistaken as a Christian rock band due to the word &quot;grace&quot; being in their name; however, Gontier noted that they were &quot;far from being a Christian rock band.&quot; The group stated that their early influences were from the bands The Tragically Hip and Our Lady Peace as well as from the Seattle rock scene, especially the group Sunny Day Real Estate.

Their self-titled album mostly features the sounds of alternative metal and nu metal, with heavy influences from Kyuss and Sunny Day Real Estate. The album drew comparison with the likes of Linkin Park, Chevelle, Depswa and Shinedown for their alternative metal and hard rock sound. On their second album, &quot;One-X&quot;, the band continued with their alternative metal sound and features songs more personal to Gontier. Music critics praised the album&#x27;s lyrics for its &quot;simple and direct approach&quot; that adds a certain charm, despite its predictability. However, on their third album, &quot;Life Starts Now&quot;, the group departs from the angry tone of the band&#x27;s previous releases into a lyrical style with more optimism while maintaining their hard rock sound. Critics compared the album&#x27;s sound to bands such as Breaking Benjamin, Collective Soul, and Godsmack. Their fourth album, &quot;Transit of Venus&quot;, included a few electronic influences. These influences are evident on tracks such as &quot;Chalk Outline&quot; and &quot;The High Road&quot;, adding a layer of thickness to the guitar-heavy work. On their fifth album, &quot;Human&quot;, the group shifted away from using electronic elements and went back to their post-grunge and alternative metal sound. However, their sixth album, &quot;Outsider&quot;, included electronic aspects influenced by Bring Me the Horizon&#x27;s 2015 album, &quot;That&#x27;s the Spirit&quot;. On their seventh album, &quot;Explosions&quot;, they continued with their gritty and hard rock sound. Critics compared the sound to their early records such as &quot;One-X&quot; for its raw angst while also stating the group heads for a mature and exploratory sound on the album.

<text>The NCAA rifle championships are contested at an annual competition sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the team and individual champions of co-educational collegiate rifle among its member programs in the United States. Unlike many NCAA sports, only one National Collegiate championship is held each season with teams from Division I, Division II, and Division III competing together. It has been held in mid-March every year since 1980, except 2020. 

The two-day event includes individual and team titles with team scoring based on the aggregate performances of individual shooters across a set of smallbore and air rifle competitions.

West Virginia have been the most successful program at the team and individual levels; the Mountaineers have won 19 team and 18 individual titles.

The current team national champions are TCU, who won their fourth team national championship at the 2024 event, held at the WVU Coliseum at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia from March 8–9.

West Virginia&#x27;s Mary Tucker won the 2024 individual title in small-bore. WVU junior Gavin Barnick won the air rifle national championship, besting Kentucky&#x27;s Braden Peiser. In the air rifle qualification round, Alaska&#x27;s Elijah Spencer fired a score of 600 (a perfect score), with 57x - one X behind the NCAA record set by Nanook Rylan Kissell at the 2023 NCAA Rifle Championship.

==Background==
===Co-ed status===
Under NCAA rules, sports teams that include both men and women are designated as men&#x27;s teams for purposes of sports sponsorship and scholarship limitations. Nonetheless, rifle has been a coed sport since 1980, a year before the NCAA began holding championships in women&#x27;s sports. Schools sponsoring rifle may field anywhere from one to three teams. If a school chooses to sponsor more than one team, it may have any combination of men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and coed teams. Two schools field men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams, and three field women&#x27;s and coed teams.

===Programs===
====Conferences====
*Great America Rifle Conference
*Mid-Atlantic Rifle Conference
*Ohio Valley Conference, the only Division I all-sports conference that sponsored rifle before the SoCon added it in 2016–17.
*Patriot Rifle Conference
*Southern Conference; resumed the sport in 2016–17 after a 30-year hiatus.

==Results==
*Prior to NCAA sponsorship in 1980, a collegiate rifle championship was held yearly by the National Rifle Association.
*From 1980 to 2004, the championship consisted of 120 shots by each competitor in smallbore, and 40 shots per competitor in air rifle. Since 2005, the championship has consisted of 60 shots for both smallbore and air rifle, equaling a total of 120 shots per team member.

<text>Lucian Blaga (; 9 May 1895 – 6 May 1961) was a Romanian philosopher, poet, playwright, poetry translator and novelist. He is considered one of the greatest philosophers and poets of Romania, and a prominent philosopher of the twentieth century who due to the unfortunate circumstances surrounding his career is barely known to the outside world.

==Biography==

Lucian Blaga was born on 9 May 1895 in Lancrăm (then Lámkerék), near Alba Iulia (then Gyulafehérvár). He was the ninth child of Isidor Blaga, an Orthodox priest, and Ana Moga. Both his parents&#x27; families had deep ties with the church: Isidor&#x27;s father, Simion Blaga, was also a priest and Ana&#x27;s family tree had a long line of priests and a bishop. His father studied at Bruckenthal Highschool in Sibiu and according to Lucian Blaga his way of being was inline with &quot;German cultural tradition&quot;: opened to technological progress and free thinking, sometimes in contrast with his profession which he did &quot;without the impetus of true conviction&quot;.

In the autobiographical &quot;The Chronicle and the Song of Ages&quot; he recalls that he was &quot;mute as a swan&quot; until the age of five, his early childhood having been &quot;under the sign of the incredible absence of the word&quot;. His mother, reassured by doctors that her child wasn&#x27;t ill, tried to convince him to speak by saying that he wouldn&#x27;t want other children to call him a mute.

&quot;I looked at my mother with bright, understanding eyes. I listened to her, but not even after this torment did my words reveal themselves. Then, after a night of some inner turmoil, the meaning of which I forgot in my wordless life, I went to her. And I started speaking. I held my hand above my eyes, and spoke. From underneath the eaves made by my fingers and palm, with which I was shielding myself from the world of the words, the speech came out whole, clear, like sieved silver.&quot;

His education started in Hungarian in the neighbouring Sebeș, where he remained until 1906, after which he attended the &quot;Andrei Șaguna&quot; high school in Brașov between 1906 and 1914. His senior thesis was Albert Einstein’s relativity and Henri Poincaré’s non-Euclidean geometry. During the second year of high school his father, Isidor, died and he remained under the supervision of a relative, Iosif Blaga. At the outbreak of the World War I, he began theological studies in Sibiu to avoid being drafted in the Austro-Hungarian army (like many Romanians from Transylvania at the time). Between 1917 and 1920 he studied philosophy and biology at the University of Vienna. Here he published his first two books, a book of poetry and a book of aphorisms, which helped him finance his studies. Also here he first met his future wife, Cornelia Brediceanu, who was studying medicine. He obtained his PhD with the thesis &quot;Kultur und Erkenntnis&quot; – a study on the relation between culture and knowledge - in 1920.
He summed his early views in his correspondence:

&quot;Philosophy is art, and this will be my philosophy. I tend toward an organic and mobile, lifelike conception about the world — a conception that I will propagate around me not by argument but by a kind of artistic suggestion... I won&#x27;t &#x27;prove, I will &#x27;infect&#x27; the environment with great art. Life is transmitted from person to person in immediate fashion, without the bridge of arguments, since life is the creative force, and everything that is creation imposes itself naturally.&quot;

His 1919 &quot;Poems of Light&quot;, published by Sextil Pușcariu – an acquaintance of Cornelia&#x27;s family - first in &quot;Glasul Bucovinei&quot;, then as a stand-alone volume, received very positive criticism, Blaga being acclaimed as a figure who &quot;represented the Transylvania of today and tomorrow&quot;, his book placed along with the Bible on the nightstand for the Queen of Romania during her visit to Transylvania following the 1918 Union. This was to pave his way for a networking trip to Bucharest where he visited the Romanian Academy and met Nicolae Iorga and Alexandru Vlahuță, among others. However, having finished his studies at Vienna and in look for an academic position, his application to Romanian University of Cluj was not successful, his Habilitation Thesis &quot;The Philosophy of Style&quot; being rejected in 1924. He wrote in the regional press, being the editor of the magazines &quot;Cultura&quot; in Cluj and &quot;Banatul&quot;&#x27; in Lugoj as well as for &quot;Patria&quot;, &quot;Voința&quot;, &quot;Adevărul literar și artistic&quot;, &quot;Universul cultural&quot; and others.

Demoralized after his failure to obtain a position at the university, he moves to Lugoj in 1926 and enters the Romanian diplomatic service, occupying posts at Romanian legations in Poland, Czechia, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.

In 1935 the Romanian Academy awarded him the Great Hamagiu Prize for his poems and plays. In the following year he was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy and delivered the &quot;Elogiul satului românesc&quot; (&quot;In Praise of the Romanian Village&quot;) acceptance speech on 5 June 1937, in the attendance of Carol II. The choice for the topic was far from arbitrary: as tradition had it, every new member of the Academy was chosen after the death of a titulary member and the newcome was expected to present an eulogy to the deceased. Since Blaga&#x27;s position was created because the Academy was expanding, he chose to eulogies what he called &quot;our unanimous, anonymous ancestor&quot;. This was also an attempt to mend the relationship with Nicolae Iorga, once an admirer of Blaga&#x27;s works, but who turned against it latter on, seeing it as corrupted by German influence, and campaigned against Blaga&#x27;s nomination.

In 1938 he was appointed undersecretary of state in the Ministry of External Affairs in Goga cabinet, a position that he gained at the intervention of King Carol II, who was impressed with Blaga&#x27;s speech for the Academy, and Veturia Goga, Octavian Goga&#x27;s wife and a friend of Blaga. Blaga disliked working in the state apparatus and was relieved when the cabinet was dismantled less than two months later. He was then assigned a position as a plenipotentiary minister to Portugal, and later as a senator of the Carol II&#x27;s party National Renaissance Front. In the same year he finally obtained a seat at King Ferdinand I University, becoming a professor of cultural philosophy, a cathedra created for him. Despite his positions held in the state he was critical of the political views on the rise before and during World War II Romania:

&quot;we witness the disgraceful and lumbering phenomenon that we call “racist messianism.” This phenomenon entails the glorification of the physical and spiritual values of a single race. Racist messianism is characterized by the belief that one specific human race possesses all the qualities that God intended to bestow upon humankind, and that all the other races share these qualities only partially or in a distorted or perverted manner&quot;

He temporarily relocated to Sibiu with the other staff in 1940 due to the Second Vienna Award. During his stay in Sibiu, in 1943, he became editor of the annual magazine &quot;Saeculum&quot;.

His long sought presence in top Romanian cultural institutions was to be short lived. Following the abdication of Carol II he came in conflict with the ideologists supporting the government (for example Dumitru Stăniloae) and in 1943, he was forced to defend his position in the Academy. Then, in 1948, although he was briefly a member of the newly formed National Popular Party, having been for a while under heavy criticism from men of the system such as Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu and Mihai Beniuc, and accused, among other things, of being an acolyte of the former king of Romania Carol II, and that he praised Corneliu Zelea Codreanu in his &quot;Avram Iancu&quot; play, he was removed from the Academy and public life by the Socialist Republic of Romania&#x27;s authorities, losing his cathedra as well. He started working as a librarian at the Cluj branch of the History Institute of the Romanian Academy. Forbidden to publish any new books, he was forced to only translate until 1960. During this period he completed the translation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, one of the German writers that he claimed influenced him most.

He died on 6 May 1961 after being diagnosed with a spinal tumor, and was buried according to the custom three days later on what would have been his 66th birthday, in his native village cemetery of Lancrăm.

He was married to Cornelia (née Brediceanu). They had a daughter, Dorli, her name being derived from , a noun that can be translated, roughly, as &quot;longing&quot;.

The University of Sibiu bears his name today.

==Philosophy==

Lucian Blaga&#x27;s philosophical system was an expression of philosophy as &quot;World view&quot; (Weltanschauung), one he elaborated upon in four trilogies: &quot;The Trilogy of Knowledge&quot; (1943) consisting of &quot;The Dogmatic Aeon&quot;, &quot;The Luciferian Knowledge&quot; and &quot;The Transcendent Censorship&quot;; &quot;The Trilogy of Culture&quot; (1944): &quot;Horizon and Style&quot;, &quot;The Mioritic Space&quot;, and &quot;The Genesis of Metaphor and the Sense of Culture&quot;; &quot;The Trilogy of Values&quot; (1946): &quot;Science and Creation&quot;, &quot;Magical Thinking and Religion&quot;, &quot;Art and Value&quot;; and &quot;The Cosmological Trilogy&quot;: &quot;The Divine Differentials&quot; (1940), &quot;Anthropological Aspects&quot;, and &quot;Historical Existence&quot;. The categorization and arrangement of the works was an editorial testament of the author before his death. Additionally, some of his less expansive writings are cited along one or another Trilogy by scholars. 

The novel &quot;Charon&#x27;s Ferry&quot; is intended to be a companion to the philosophical trilogies. In it Blaga addresses some of the more problematic philosophical issues such as those pertaining to political, (para)psychological or occult phenomena, under the name of a fictive philosopher (Leonte Pătrașcu).

While systematic in exposition Blaga&#x27;s philosophy is interconnected with his artistic works and with art in general, sharing both terms and style, for example the development, definition, and naming of his fundamental modalities of knowledge, the &quot;Luciferian knowledge&quot; and the &quot;Paradisian knowledge&quot;, which are (only in broad lines) the mainstream philosophical concept-terms of intuitive knowledge and conceptual knowledge. This is an intentional direction set by the author who saw philosphy as closer to art than to science - in the sense of rejecting Positivism and embracing Constructivism as an avenue of understanding the world.

In terms of relation with other philosophers and philosophy currents, most often cited are Plotinus, Immanuel Kant, and the German Romantics. Parallels are also drawn to Friedrich Nietzsche, Henri Bergson, and Martin Heidegger, among many others. However, Blaga&#x27;s philosophy is invariably acclaimed as original.

<text>Axim is a coastal town and the capital of Nzema East Municipal district, a district in Western Region of South Ghana. Axim lies 64 kilometers west of the port city of Sekondi-Takoradi in the Western Region, west of Cape Three Points. Axim has a 2013 settlement population of 27,719 people.

==History==

This area was occupied by the Nzema people.

The Portuguese arrived by the early 16th century as traders. They built a prominent seaside fort, Fort Santo Antonio, in 1515. They exported some Africans as slaves to Europe and the Americas. Between 1642 and 1872, the fort was expanded and altered by the Dutch, who &quot;ruled&quot; during that period. The fort, now property of Ghana, is open to the public. Off-shore are some picturesque islands, including one with a lighthouse.

==Axim structure==
The town of Axim is divided into two parts: Upper Axim and Lower Axim. Fort Santo Antonio lies roughly on the division between the two parts, but closest to the centre of Upper Axim, the original European settlement. Here, several large mansions of lumber-trading magnates and other businessmen remain from the late 19th century and period of the British empire. Axim is governed by a political District Executive of the Nzema East Municipality.

==Economy==
The economy is based mainly on Axim&#x27;s fishing fleet, but the area also has three tourist beach resorts as well as coconut and rubber plantations. The scenic and fertile terrain features many palm trees. Local artisanal miners pan for gold in streams inland from Axim.

Axim has a transport station, two major bank branches, and some rural banks including the Ahantaman Rural Bank, Nzema Maanle Rural Bank, Lower Pra Rural Bank.

==Culture==
Every August, the major festivals of Kundum takes place, coinciding with the best fishing-catch of the year; people come to Axim for the festivities and to fish and trade.

==Tourism==
There is a wonderful beach in Axim. The very place around the beach, perched on a hillside, is an exuberant nature has no equal in Ghana. The waves of the beach are strong and suitable for surfers.

==Climate==
Axim has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) with oppressively hot and humid weather year-round. There are two dry seasons in January-February and August-September — the latter due to the northern extension of the cold, foggy Beneguela Current — but some rainfall is seen even in these periods. May and June are the wettest months with rainfall typically over in May and over in June. 
==Notable locals==
*January Conny, known by many names, of which the best-known is John Canoe, was an Akan warrior and chief of the Ahanta people, an ally of Brandenburg-Prussia against the British and the Dutch, in the Brandenburger Gold Coast colony (1683–1720) in Axim. His true name has been lost to history, although the name &quot;Kenu&quot; is an authentic Akan name.
*Anton Wilhelm Amo (1703–1756), the first black African to receive a philosophical education in Europe and to publish philosophical works there and in Germany. He published &quot;The Rights of Moors&quot; (among other works) and taught philosophy at the University of Jena.

<doc id="576546" wikidata="Q686683" url="?curid=576546" title="Richard Rhodes">
<text>Richard Lee Rhodes (born July 4, 1937) is an American historian, journalist, and author of both fiction and nonfiction, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot; (1986), and most recently, &quot;Energy: A Human History&quot; (2018).

Rhodes has been awarded grants from the Ford Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation among others. Rhodes is an affiliate of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. He also frequently gives lectures and talks on a broad range of subjects, including testimony to the U.S. Senate on nuclear energy.

==Biography==
Richard Rhodes was born in Kansas City, Kansas, in 1937. Following his mother&#x27;s suicide on July 25, 1938, Rhodes and his older brother Stanley were raised in the Kansas City, Missouri, area by his father, a railroad boilermaker with a third-grade education. When Rhodes was ten, their father remarried. The new wife starved, exploited, and abused the children. One day Stanley walked into a police station and reported their living conditions.

The brothers were removed from their father&#x27;s custody and sent to the Andrew Drumm Institute, an institution for boys founded in 1928 in Independence, Missouri. The admission of the brothers was something of an anomaly as the institution was designed for orphaned or indigent boys and they fit neither category. The Drumm Institute is still in operation today, and now accepts both boys and girls. Rhodes became a member of the board of trustees in 1991. Rhodes wrote about his childhood in &quot;A Hole in the World&quot;.

Richard and Stanley lived at Drumm for the remainder of their adolescence. Both graduated from high school. Rhodes was admitted to Yale University with a full scholarship and graduated with honors in 1959, a member of Manuscript Society.

Rhodes has published 23 books as well as numerous articles for national magazines, and wrote a play that is based on the historic 1986 meeting between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. His best-known work, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, was published in 1986 and earned him the Pulitzer Prize and numerous other awards. Many of his personal documents and research materials are part of the Kansas Collection at the Spencer Research Library, University of Kansas.

Rhodes is the father of two children and is a grandfather. He and his second wife, Ginger Rhodes, have made their home in California.

==Nuclear history==
Rhodes came to national prominence with his 1986 book, &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot;, a narrative of the history of the people and events during World War II from the discoveries leading to the science of nuclear fission in the 1930s, through the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Among its many honors, the 900-page book won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, the National Book Award for Nonfiction, and a National Book Critics Circle Award, and has sold hundreds of thousands of copies in English alone, as well as having been translated into a dozen or so other languages.

Praised by both historians and former Los Alamos weapon engineers and scientists alike, the book is considered a general authority on early nuclear weapons history, as well as the development of modern physics in general, during the first half of the 20th century. According to a citation on the first page of the book, Nobel Laureate Isidor Rabi, one of the prime participants in the dawn of the atomic age, said about the book, &quot;An epic worthy of Milton. Nowhere else have I seen the whole story put down with such elegance and gusto and in such revealing detail and simple language which carries the reader through wonderful and profound scientific discoveries and their application.&quot; In 2012 the book was reissued as a 25th anniversary edition with a new foreword by Rhodes.

In 1992, Rhodes followed it up by compiling, editing, and writing the introduction to an annotated version of &quot;The Los Alamos Primer&quot;, by Manhattan Project scientist Robert Serber. The &quot;Primer&quot; was a set of lectures given to new arrivals at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory during wartime to get them up to speed about the prominent questions needing to be solved in bomb design, and had been largely declassified in 1965, but was not widely available.
In 1993, Rhodes published &quot;Nuclear Renewal: Common Sense about Energy&quot; detailing the history of the nuclear power industry in the United States, and future promises of nuclear power.

Rhodes published a sequel to &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot; in 1995, &quot;Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb&quot;, which told the story of the atomic espionage during World War II (Klaus Fuchs, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, among others), the debates over whether the hydrogen bomb ought to be produced (see History of nuclear weapons), and the eventual creation of the bomb and its consequences for the arms race.

In 1997 Rhodes appeared in the UK Channel 4 TV series &quot;Equinox&quot; episode &quot;A Very British Bomb&quot; about the UK&#x27;s efforts after the war to develop its own nuclear weapons after collaboration with the US had been halted by the 1946 MacMahon Act.

In 2007, Rhodes published &quot;Arsenals of Folly: The Making of the Nuclear Arms Race&quot;, a chronicle of the arms buildups during the Cold War, especially focusing on Mikhail Gorbachev and the Reagan administration.

&quot;The Twilight of the Bombs&quot;, the fourth and final volume in his series on nuclear history, was published in 2010. The book documents, among other topics, the post-Cold War nuclear history of the world, nuclear proliferation, and nuclear terrorism.

==Other prominent works==
&quot;John James Audubon&quot;, published in 2004, is a biography of the French-born American artist, John James Audubon (1785–1851). Audubon is known for his life-sized watercolor illustrations of birds and wildlife, including &quot;The Birds of America&quot;, a multi-volume work published through subscriptions in the mid-19th century, first in England and then in the United States. Rhodes also edited a collection of Audubon&#x27;s letters and writings published by Everyman&#x27;s Library (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006)—&quot;The Audubon Reader&quot;.

Rhodes&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;Deadly Feasts&quot; is a work of verity concerning transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), prions, and the career of Daniel Carleton Gajdusek. It reviews the history of TSE epidemics, beginning with the infection of large numbers of the Fore people of the New Guinea Eastern Highlands during a period when they consumed their dead in mortuary feasts, and explores the link between new variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (nvCJD) in humans and the consumption of beef contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly referred to as mad cow disease.

&quot;Hedy&#x27;s Folly&quot; was published in November 2011 and deals with the life and work of the Hollywood actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr.

Rhodes’s book &quot;Hell and Good Company&quot;, published in 2015, is about the Spanish Civil War and the changes that came from it.

Though less well known as a writer of fiction, Rhodes is also the author of four novels. Three of the four went out of print, but &quot;The Ungodly: A Novel of the Donner Party,&quot; his first, was reissued in a new edition in 2007 by Stanford University Press.

&quot;Science-Based Medicine&quot; writer Steven Novella says that Rhodes&#x27;s book from 2018 &quot;Energy: A Human History&quot; reviews the history of our use of energy from around 1500 to the present. Novella writes, &quot;it is well-researched and contains a wealth of historical information... A few themes stuck out for me in the book. One was how similar the social, political, and market forces are today and in the past when it comes to energy&quot; and &quot;the book is timely because the history of our energy decisions in the past is great background for our energy decisions today from his 2018 review.&quot;

<doc id="576557" wikidata="Q3407592" url="?curid=576557" title="Bacteriological water analysis">
<text>Bacteriological water analysis is a method of analysing water to estimate the numbers of bacteria present and, if needed, to find out what sort of bacteria they are. It represents one aspect of water quality. It is a microbiological analytical procedure which uses samples of water and from these samples determines the concentration of bacteria. It is then possible to draw inferences about the suitability of the water for use from these concentrations. This process is used, for example, to routinely confirm that water is safe for human consumption or that bathing and recreational waters are safe to use.

The interpretation and the action trigger levels for different waters vary depending on the use made of the water. Whilst very stringent levels apply to drinking water, more relaxed levels apply to marine bathing waters, where much lower volumes of water are expected to be ingested by users.

==Approach==
The common feature of all these routine screening procedures is that the primary analysis is for indicator organisms rather than the pathogens that might cause concern. Indicator organisms are bacteria such as non-specific coliforms, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; that are very commonly found in the human or animal gut and which, if detected, may suggest the presence of sewage. Indicator organisms are used because even when a person is infected with a more pathogenic bacteria, they will still be excreting many millions times more indicator organisms than pathogens. It is therefore reasonable to surmise that if indicator organism levels are low, then pathogen levels will be very much lower or absent. Judgements as to suitability of water for use are based on very extensive precedents and relate to the probability of any sample population of bacteria being able to be infective at a reasonable statistical level of confidence.

Analysis is usually performed using culture, biochemical and sometimes optical methods. When indicator organisms levels exceed pre-set triggers, specific analysis for pathogens may then be undertaken and these can be quickly detected (where suspected) using specific culture methods or molecular biology.

==Methodologies==
The most reliable methods are direct plate count method and membrane filtration method. mEndo Agar is used in the membrane filtration while VRBA Agar is used in the direct plate count method. VRBA stands for violet red bile agar. A media that contains bile salts which promotes the growth of gram negative and has inhibitory characteristic to gram positive although not complete inhibitory.

These media contain lactose which is usually fermented by lactose fermenting bacteria producing colonies that can be identified and characterised. Lactose fermenting produce colored colonies while non lactose fermenting produce colorless ones. Because the analysis is always based on a very small sample taken from a very large volume of water, all methods rely on statistical principles.

===Multiple tube method===
One of the oldest methods is called the multiple tube method. In this method a measured sub-sample (perhaps 10 ml) is diluted with 100 ml of sterile growth medium and an aliquot of 10 ml is then decanted into each of ten tubes. The remaining 10 ml is then diluted again and the process repeated. At the end of 5 dilutions this produces 50 tubes covering the dilution range of 1:10 through to 1:10000.

The tubes are then incubated at a pre-set temperature for a specified time and at the end of the process the number of tubes with growth in is counted for each dilution. Statistical tables are then used to derive the concentration of organisms in the original sample. This method can be enhanced by using indicator medium which changes colour when acid forming species are present and by including a tiny inverted tube called a Durham tube in each sample tube. The Durham inverted tube catches any gas produced. The production of gas at 37 degrees Celsius is a strong indication of the presence of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

===ATP testing===
An ATP test is the process of rapidly measuring active microorganisms in water through detection adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is a molecule found only in and around living cells, and as such it gives a direct measure of biological concentration and health. ATP is quantified by measuring the light produced through its reaction with the naturally occurring enzyme firefly luciferase using a luminometer. The amount of light produced is directly proportional to the amount of biological energy present in the sample.

Second generation ATP tests are specifically designed for water, wastewater and industrial applications where, for the most part, samples contain a variety of components that can interfere with the ATP assay.

===Plate count===
The plate count method relies on bacteria growing a colony on a nutrient medium so that the colony becomes visible to the naked eye and the number of colonies on a plate can be counted. To be effective, the dilution of the original sample must be arranged so that on average between 30 and 300 colonies of the target bacterium are grown. Fewer than 30 colonies makes the interpretation statistically unsound whilst greater than 300 colonies often results in overlapping colonies and imprecision in the count. To ensure that an appropriate number of colonies will be generated several dilutions are normally cultured. This approach is widely utilised for the evaluation of the effectiveness of water treatment by the inactivation of representative microbial contaminants such as &quot;E. coli&quot; following ASTM D5465.

The laboratory procedure involves making serial dilutions of the sample (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, etc.) in sterile water and cultivating these on nutrient agar in a dish that is sealed and incubated. Typical media include plate count agar for a general count or MacConkey agar to count Gram-negative bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot;. Typically one set of plates is incubated at 22 °C and for 24 hours and a second set at 37 °C for 24 hours. The composition of the nutrient usually includes reagents that resist the growth of non-target organisms and make the target organism easily identified, often by a colour change in the medium. Some recent methods include a fluorescent agent so that counting of the colonies can be automated. At the end of the incubation period the colonies are counted by eye, a procedure that takes a few moments and does not require a microscope as the colonies are typically a few millimetres across.

===Membrane filtration===
Most modern laboratories use a refinement of total plate count in which serial dilutions of the sample are vacuum filtered through purpose made membrane filters and these filters are themselves laid on nutrient medium within sealed plates. The methodology is otherwise similar to conventional total plate counts. Membranes have a printed millimetre grid printed on and can be reliably used to count the number of colonies under a binocular microscope.

===Pour plate method===
When the analysis is looking for bacterial species that grow poorly in air, the initial analysis is done by mixing serial dilutions of the sample in liquid nutrient agar which is then poured into bottles which are then sealed and laid on their sides to produce a sloping agar surface. Colonies that develop in the body of the medium can be counted by eye after incubation.

The total number of colonies is referred to as the total viable count (TVC). The unit of measurement is cfu/ml (or colony forming units per millilitre) and relates to the original sample. Calculation of this is a multiple of the counted number of colonies multiplied by the dilution used.

==Pathogen analysis==
When samples show elevated levels of indicator bacteria, further analysis is often undertaken to look for specific pathogenic bacteria. Species commonly investigated in the temperate zone include &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot; and &quot;Salmonella Typhimurium&quot;.
Depending on the likely source of contamination investigation may also extend to organisms such as &quot;Cryptosporidium spp&quot;.
In tropical areas analysis of &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; is also routinely undertaken.

==Types of nutrient media used in analysis==
MacConkey agar is culture medium designed to grow Gram-negative bacteria and stain them for lactose fermentation. It contains bile salts (to inhibit most Gram-positive bacteria), crystal violet dye (which also inhibits certain Gram-positive bacteria), neutral red dye (which stains microbes fermenting lactose), lactose and peptone. Alfred Theodore MacConkey developed it while working as a bacteriologist for the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal in the United Kingdom.

Endo agar contains peptone, lactose, dipotassium phosphate, agar, sodium sulfite, basic fuchsin and was originally developed for the isolation of &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot;, but is now commonly used in water analysis. As in MacConkey agar, coliform organisms ferment the lactose, and the colonies become red. Non-lactose-fermenting organisms produce clear, colourless colonies against the faint pink background of the medium.

&quot;mFC medium&quot; is used in membrane filtration and contains selective and differential agents. These include rosolic acid to inhibit bacterial growth in general, except for fecal coliforms, bile salts inhibit non-enteric bacteria and aniline blue indicates the ability of fecal coliforms to ferment lactose to acid that causes a pH change in the medium.

&quot;TYEA medium&quot; contains tryptone, yeast extract, common salt and L-arabinose per liter of glass distilled
water and is a non selective medium usually cultivated at two temperatures (22 and 36 °C) to determine a general level of contamination (a.k.a. colony count).

<text>Popish soap was a derisive name applied to soap manufactured under a patent granted by Charles I. Because the board of the manufacturing company included Catholics, the term &quot;Popish Soap&quot; (after The Pope) was applied to this monopoly commodity. It was said by anti-Catholics to be particularly harmful to linen and washerwomen&#x27;s hands.

During the personal rule of the English King Charles I (1629–1640), one of the ways in which he attempted to raise money was through the granting of patents. This came about as a result of a loophole in the statute forbidding such action.

One such patent was granted to a soap corporation.

The soap industry was overseen by Lord Treasurer Portland and his friends, all of whom displayed Catholic character. When Portland died, Laud and Cottington contended over the company, which increased annual profits to the crown to nearly 33,000 pounds by the end of the 1630s.

It was alleged that popish soap scarred the soul as well as skin and fabric.

<text>Central is a heritage-listed railway station located in the centre of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The station is Australia&#x27;s largest and busiest railway station, and is a major transport interchange for NSW TrainLink inter-city rail services, Sydney Trains commuter rail services, Sydney Metro services, Sydney light rail services, bus services, and private coach transport services. The station is also known as Sydney Terminal (Platforms 1 to 12). The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It recorded 85.4 million passenger movements in 2018 and serves over 250,000 people daily.

Central station occupies a large city block separating , Surry Hills and the central business district, bounded by Railway Square and Pitt Street in the west, Eddy Avenue in the north, Elizabeth Street in the east and the Devonshire Street Tunnel in the south. Parts of the station and marshalling yards extend as far south as Cleveland Street, and are located on the site of the former Devonshire Street Cemetery.

== History ==
There have been three terminal stations in Sydney.

=== First Sydney terminal ===
The railway arrived in New South Wales in 1831. Proposals began in the 1840s for a railway linking Sydney and Parramatta, with an eastern terminus close to the Sydney city centre.

Although the Sydney Railway Company first applied to the government for four blocks of land between Hay and Cleveland streets in 1849, the Surveyor General favoured Grose Farm, now the grounds of the University of Sydney. It was further from the city and less costly to develop. The company finally exchanged land in the first, second and third blocks, between Hay and Devonshire Streets, for an increased area of in the fourth block, the Government Paddocks, between Devonshire and Cleveland Streets. Hence, the site of the first Sydney railway terminus was located here from 1855.

The original Sydney station was opened on 26 September 1855 in an area known as Cleveland Fields. It was a temporary timber and corrugated iron building, constructed rapidly in late August to early September 1855, in time for the opening of the line to Parramatta for passenger trains.

This station (one wooden platform in a corrugated iron shed), called &quot;Sydney Terminal&quot;, had Devonshire Street as its northern boundary. It was frequently but unofficially called &quot;Redfern Station&quot;, while at that time, the present Redfern Station was officially called &quot;Eveleigh&quot;. Although called &quot;Redfern Station&quot;, the first and second Sydney Terminals were never actually located in Redfern, being to the north of Cleveland Street, which is Redfern&#x27;s northern boundary.

The first and second station buildings were both in the form of a shed which covered the main line. A photograph of the exterior of the first station taken in 1871 shows vertical boarding, windows with a hood and a corrugated iron roof, with a roof vent. Internally, the stud framing and timber truss roof members were exposed. The offices and public facilities were contained in the adjacent lean-to, which faced George Street.

Only one platform and the main up-line served the passenger station. A similar platform and line layout was used for the Mortuary Station, constructed 15 years later; however, the level of detail and materials varied considerably. The first station building was extended almost immediately, a shed being constructed at the southern end to cover an additional of platform.

===Second Sydney terminal===
When the station became inadequate for the traffic it carried, a new station was built in 1874 on the same site and was also called Sydney Terminal.
The Second Sydney Terminal was a more substantial brick station building, initially with two platforms. The second station building was constructed on the site of the first station, the main hall spanning the up and down mainlines. Separate platforms and facilities were provided for arriving and departing passengers. The new station building appears to have taken three years to complete: the drawings are dated 1871, while the official opening was in 1874. The second station, like the first, was constructed to allow for a future extension of the line into the city, the lines initially extending just far enough past the building to accommodate a steam locomotive.

John Whitton, the engineer-in-chief, designed a neo-classical station building to be constructed of brick, with the decorative detail formed using polychromatic and relief work. Almost immediately the demand for platform space during peak times resulted in additional branch lines and platforms being constructed adjacent to the passenger station. These lines were brought in front of the station, obscuring it from view and isolating the verandah. By 1890 Whitton&#x27;s station building had become engulfed within a sea of sheds and tram platform canopies. The second Redfern station, demolished following the completion of the first stage of the main terminal building , was a gloomy building, the glass in the roof lantern not permitting a great deal of light to enter and the soot from the steam locomotives coating the surfaces with grime.

The second station grew to 14 platforms before it was replaced by the present-day station to the north of Devonshire Street.

===Proposals for extension into the city===
In major metropolitan areas the rail terminus tended to be located within the inner core of the city. The site of the first and second station termini was inconveniently located for the city. Initially, a horse-bus service operated from the station to the city and both the engineer-in-chief, John Whitton, and the Chief Commissioner for Railways, B. H. Martindale, recognised the urgency of a city rail extension.

In 1877, John Young, a prominent Sydney builder and local politician, proposed a scheme to provide a circular city extension to the railway. The route included stations at Oxford Street, William Street and Woolloomooloo in the east, Circular Quay, then Dawes Point and a line parallel to Darling Harbour in the west. John Whitton designed a grand city terminus at the corner of Hunter and Castlereagh Streets two years later. Neither of these schemes eventuated.

In 1895, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works advised that a royal commission should be constituted to &quot;inquire into the question of bringing the railway from its present terminus at Redfern into the city&quot;. The findings of the commission, favouring a site in St James Road, were released in 1897. The term Central Station was now in common use. The public works annual report of 1896–1897 noted that &quot;the Railway Construction Branch was called upon to furnish voluminous plans and estimates of the cost of the various proposals brought before the commission. After a most exhaustive investigation, the Royal Commission reported, almost unanimously, in favour of the extension of the railway into the city by the route and according to the plan as described as the St James Road Scheme&quot;.In 1897, Norman Selfe drew up a scheme for the gradual enlargement and extension of the railway to the northern end of the city and in the same year Railway Commissioner, E. M. G. Eddy, proposed a terminal city station at the corner of Elizabeth Street and St James&#x27; Road. The route of the latter was virtually the same as that for 1879, however, the new site for the terminus included half of the northern end of Hyde Park. Although of the burial ground in Devonshire Street was offered as compensation, public sentiment still opposed the loss of Hyde Park.

The initial designs for a near Sydney Terminal were prepared by Henry Deane, the Engineer-in-Chief of Railway Construction in consultation with the Railway Commissioners. Deane is reputed to have prepared 10 schemes for the royal commission. Although the St James location was preferred, a scheme that did not involve the disturbance of or use of land in Hyde Park was sought. The extension of Belmore Park was initially proposed in the 1897 scheme as compensation for the use of the northwestern corner of Hyde Park as a railway station. Following a change of government the St James scheme was abandoned and Deane prepared, , a further two schemes, one of which was for the Old Burial Ground Site.The royal commission in 1897 again considered the city railway extension because of dangerous congestion at Redfern and recommended using Hyde Park. Then, after an investigative trip overseas, Henry Deane prepared alternative proposals for a new railway terminal for the government in 1900. The second scheme proposal called for the resumption of the Devonshire Street cemeteries, but this was cheaper and less contentious than the acquisition of Hyde Park. It was the second scheme which was eventually adopted.

The earlier schemes to extend the lines further into the city would have been prohibitively expensive and would have required large scale resumptions. The site of the Old Burial ground was, in comparison, relatively easily obtainable as no private land was involved. Due to the extent of the resumption there would, in addition to a terminus, be room for the extension of the goods yard and the erection of a carriage shed and post office. The existing lines were at a higher level than the Burial Ground, so rather than lowering the existing railway track, the tramlines were to be raised to serve a high level station. The Public Works Committee passed the design on 7 June 1900, however, a much modified building was actually constructed.

The total estimated cost of the works was to be with the general works estimated at , the Station Building estimated at and the Resumptions estimated at . Almost immediately these estimates proved conservative, there was much public concern regarding the removal of bodies from the Old Burial ground and a new cemetery, the Botany Cemetery, had to be constructed, at public expense, at La Perouse.

===Third Sydney terminal (Central station) ===
===Devonshire Street Cemetery work and construction of third Sydney terminal===
When the third station was built in 1906, it moved one block north, closer to the city. It fronted Garden Road, which was realigned to form Eddy Avenue. If Belmore Park is included, all the land now occupied by the railway at Central and Redfern coincides with the company&#x27;s original selection of four blocks between Hay and Cleveland Streets. The present station was officially opened on 4 August 1906 and opening for passengers on 5 August 1906.

During Governor Macquarie&#x27;s term, the future site of the Sydney Terminal was beyond the limits of settlement, which were marked by the tollhouse located at the end of George Street and at the entrance to Railway Square.

Central station was designed by the government architect, Walter Liberty Vernon. The new station was built on a site previously occupied by the Devonshire Street Cemetery, South Sydney Morgue, the Convent of the Good Samaritan, the Sydney Female Refuge, police barracks and superintendent&#x27;s residence (on Pitt Street), Christ Church Parsonage, the Benevolent Asylum (fronting Railway Square), a steam train depot (at the corner of Pitt Street with Garden Road), as well as some residential properties on Railway Place. The convent, female refuge and police barracks were all original part of &quot;Carters Barracks&quot;, built in 1819 to house convict gangs working as carters on the brick fields. The adjacent field which is today Belmore Park was known as the &quot;police paddock&quot;, after the police barracks.

The remains exhumed from the cemetery were re-interred at several other Sydney cemeteries including Rookwood and Waverley cemeteries. Bodies were moved to Botany by steam tram motors and flat cars.

====Terminus redesign====
E. O&#x27;Sullivan, the Minister for Works, in 1901, established the [Central] Station Advisory Board, comprising railway experts to &quot;investigate the question of the design and arrangements of the station&quot;. The members included Walter Liberty Vernon, both of the chief engineers of the New South Wales railway (for railway construction and existing lines respectively), and the chief engineers of the Queensland and Victorian railways. The committee also considered a suitable design for the new Flinders Street station in Melbourne. The design for the Sydney Terminus was to be a collaboration between the architect and the railway engineers. The layout was largely determined by the planning requirements of the railway engineers, to which an appropriate architectural style was overlaid. However, the initial scheme did not contain the required accommodation and an enlargement of the building was approved by the minister. The cost estimate was now . The board were to fulfil the wishes of the minister that &quot;the building should be a monumental work of stateliness and beauty&quot;.

An early proposal for the new terminus, and the changes to the surrounding area, were reported in the &quot;Sydney Mail&quot; in 1901:

This design, with pavilions and a mansard roof, was strongly influenced by French Renaissance chateaux. The scale of the building, arrangement of the approaches and viaducts, the ground level colonnade and the position of the clocktower are all similar to the subsequent scheme, which was actually constructed.

By June 1901, work had begun on forming the site of the new station at Devonshire Street, the PWD Annual Report for 1900/01 noting that &quot;a great deal of preliminary work has had to be done in the preparation of the site for the new station and the extension of the railway, owing to the necessity of removing the bodies from the old cemetery and providing a new cemetery to receive the remains, as well as the demolition of the buildings and disposal of the material. The work of clearing and levelling is now well in hand.&quot; &quot;Private removals were commenced on the 29th of February 1901 and at the end of the year 1,145 bodies had been removed.&quot; Families could remove the remains to a cemetery of their choosing, however, the majority of bodies removed were relocated, at government expense, to the new cemetery at La Perouse. The Belmore Park to Fort Macquarie Electric Tramway was also constructed in 1900–1901.
The earlier brick and sandstone design, with a mansard roof, was abandoned in favour of an all sandstone terminus building which largely incorporated the same passenger, tram and vehicle separation as the earlier scheme. During 1899 a Parliamentary Standing Committee had debated whether the major public buildings should be constructed of brick with a sandstone trim or all sandstone. This committee determined that, for major public buildings, sandstone should be used.

Two designs, by members of the Government Architects Branch, were submitted for the façades in October 1901 to the Minister for Public Works and to the Railway Commissioners with the accompanying comment by the &quot;Board of Experts&quot; advising on the design of Central Station &quot;we are of the opinion that either one or the other of the architectural designs which accompany this report may with confidence be adopted&quot;. Of the two façade options, that of Gorrie McLeish Blair was reputedly selected. The 1901/02 Annual Report describes the progress a year later, &quot;work has progressed vigorously during the year. All the old buildings and human remains have been removed from the site and the foundation stone was laid at the corner of Pitt-street and the New Belmore road on the 30th April. The information of New-Street, 2 chains in width, the extension of Castlereagh-street and the widening of Hay and Elizabeth Streets is well forward. The levelling of the whole site is practically finished, and great improvements have been made to Belmore and Prince Alfred Parks by filling in with the spoil excavated for the foundations&quot;.

A more detailed account is given of the excavation: &quot;the excavation to the docks and main building containing some 80,000 cubic yards, has been taken out and the material removed to Belmore Park, where it forms the tramway embankments and raises the general level of the park. About 30,000 cubic yards of material from the Castlereagh-street cutting have been utilised in improving the level of Prince Alfred Park.&quot;

In early 1902, the design of the terminus building was changed yet again, at the request of the &quot;Board of Experts&quot; advising on the design of Central that &quot;the station building has been increased in height by one storey, and considerably in length of front, and an east wing added. A tower also of fine proportions has been included. The completed building consequently shows a much larger building than originally proposed, but it is thought in the future it will come into use. In the meantime, certain parts can be left out and added afterwards, but in spite of all such reduction the estimated cost of the new building and the main roof will amount to about as compared with &quot;.

As it was being built, it was reported that &quot;Everything in connection with the new station appears to have been designed on a grand scale, from the great elevated approaches down to the system of handling luggage underground.&quot; It is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register and the now defunct Register of the National Estate.

Henry Deane, in a lecture given to the Sydney University Engineering Society in 1902, describes the layout of the Central Railway Station that was currently under construction: In his lecture, he also discusses many of the technical aspects of the design including luggage handling, the lifts, the water towers, the train shed roof, which was subsequently deleted as a cost-cutting measure, the platforms and signalling. A novel method of luggage handling was designed for Central to &quot;get rid of the objectionable luggage-trolley, which is always frightening nervous people&quot;. An overhead luggage carrying system had been developed in England, however, in the case of Central station, &quot;the levels permit of its being carried on underground by means of subways and lifts at suitable points&quot;. The mail was also to be transferred by subway.

The train shed roof was to be designed to have a central span of with two sides spans of . Three pin trusses were to be employed, which were to be brought to the ground to provide intermediate support. The roof was to be continuous. This truss and roof configuration was to be based on that of the Union Station, St Louis, visited by Deane in 1894. Such a roof would have rivalled those of the major metropolitan termini in Europe and America. The platform area was to be double that of the earlier station and correspondingly double the number of passengers could be accommodated. The maximum number of passengers that the Devonshire Street station could accommodate was 20,000; the new station would be able to accommodate 40,000. The location of the cab rank was also discussed, it having been decided not to incorporate a cab rank inside the building so that the new station could be &quot;kept entirely free from the smell, which the standing of horses under the roof must certainly involve&quot;.

The last train departed platform 5 of the 1874 station at midnight of 4 August 1906. During the remainder of that night, the passenger concourse was demolished and the line extended through the old station into the new station. The &quot;Western Mail&quot; arrived at 05:50 on 5 August 1906 at the new station. Devonshire Street, which separated the two stations, became a pedestrian underpass to allow people to cross the railway line and is now known by many as the Devonshire Street Tunnel.

An clock tower in the Free Classical style was added at the north-western corner of the station, opening on 12 March 1921. The clock was designed by Richard Lamb and Alfred Fairfax, the co-founders of Fairfax &amp; Roberts.

===Tram approaches and Belmore Park===

On a continuous axis with the first station building, Belmore Park originally fronted the first Hay and Corn Markets in Hay Street. When the third station was located one block further north, it linked up with the southern side of Belmore Park. The park then fortuitously provided a green foil to the commanding city front of the station.

In 1902, the Railway and Tramway Construction Branch, headed by Henry Deane, reported that &quot;plans and detail drawings have been prepared in the office for the whole of the retaining wall and shops in Pitt-Street, both north and south of the new road in front of the Station, also for the Devonshire-Street subway and for the whole of the basement floors, including drainage, telephone tunnels, &amp;c.&quot; At this stage, the estimated cost of the works was 561,600 pounds, however, it was &quot;probable that his estimate will be exceeded&quot;.

The necessary tramway deviations, of track, were laid in 1901–02 using day labour. The track consisted of rails laid on sleepers. The curve and the poles were manufactured by local engineering firms including Clyde Engineering Co. The Permanent Way (i.e. track) was imported either from England or America. The construction of the first stage of the station began in June 1902 and was completed in August 1906. By 30 June 1903 the following works had been completed:

The 1908 &quot;Royal Commission for the Improvement of the City of Sydney&quot; and its Suburbs offered two schemes which, in providing vehicular access, attempted to resolve the discrepancy in scale between Belmore Park and the station building. The scheme presented by John Sulman consisted of two circular roadways, one above the other, around Belmore Park. The Commissioners, however, favoured a less grandiose Scheme prepared by Norman Selfe.

Although neither scheme was attempted, Selfe&#x27;s proposal is recalled in the Elizabeth Street ramp which was built in 1925 to allow the extension of an electric connection to the city. The park, needless to say, was never raised to the height of the assembly platform.

===Eastern façade===
The Elizabeth Street façade of the Sydney Terminus has received less attention. Facing the working class terraces in Surry Hills, the eastern wing was finished in brick rather than stone when shortage of funds hurried completion of the first stage of the station in 1906. It was the obvious location for expansion when new platforms were added to the original complex to provide the electrical city and suburban connection in 1926. The grand station building is eclipsed from view at street level by the Elizabeth Street ramp, and the later semi-circular classical entrance portico to the city connection is in refined contrast to the rusticated blocks and heavy treatment of the main building.

===Battle of Central station (1916)===
The Liverpool riot of 1916, sometimes called the &quot;battle of Central station&quot;, took place after soldiers rebelling against camp conditions had raided hotels in Liverpool and travelled to the city by commandeered trains. Upon arrival at Central station, the rioters set about destroying the station facilities, and fire was exchanged between rampaging rioters and military police. One rioter was shot dead and several were injured. The only remaining evidence of the gun battle is a small bullet-hole in the marble by the entrance to platform 1. This incident had a direct influence on the introduction of 6 o&#x27;clock closing of hotels in 1916, which lasted in New South Wales until 1955.

=== Electrification ===
The original proposal for electrification was for the North Shore line, from Hornsby to , a separate line which could be electrified without impact on the remainder of the rail system. However, due to the necessity of building the City Underground Railway and the proposal for a Sydney Harbour Bridge, not to mention the expansion of the Illawarra and Bankstown lines, the program was altered in order that the electrification could be linked with these proposed expansions. From Well Street, Redfern eight tracks would continue as the City Railway whilst four would carry the country trains to the Sydney Terminal. An above ground station would include a link to allow the transfer of passengers and baggage to the Sydney Terminal. This new station was constructed on the east side.

South of the station buildings, additional works built to accommodate the electrification and expansion of the city and suburban lines included extensions to the Cleveland Street Bridge and flyovers. The Devonshire Street subway and Devonshire Street wall were extended through the new suburban section. The new viaduct along Elizabeth Street included new bridges over Eddy Avenue, Campbell Street and Hay Street and a new retaining wall along Elizabeth Street.

=== Modernisation ===
Modernisation programs were undertaken in 1955 and again in 1964. In the 1955 work, a booking hall was created (in the former refreshment room, now the railway bar). Murals depicting railway scenes lined the walls and a terrazzo map of Australia was installed on the floor. In October 1980 a modernisation program at the Sydney Terminal commenced. The objective of the work was to improve the facilities for both passenger convenience and comfort. The start of this modernisation program coincided with the 125th Anniversary of the NSW Railways and it was at a time when many major service advances were being made to the State Rail System.

=== Darling Harbour line ===
In addition to the construction of the main trunk line between Sydney and Parramatta in 1855, a branch line between Darling Harbour and the Sydney Yard, with a cutting and underpass to carry the line under George Street, was also constructed. This line was to allow for the transfer of goods to be exported by ship, primarily wool bales. In the first decades of settlement goods were loaded and unloaded in Sydney Cove, however, as the city expanded the wharves extended round into Cockle Bay (Darling Harbour). The presence of the rail link would have influenced the development of this harbour. The Darling Harbour Line was one of the first cuttings and overbridges to be constructed as part of the NSW Rail network. In contrast to later structures sandstone was used to line the walls of the underpass and to form the overbridge. The Darling Harbour Line partially followed the line of an existing water course, the Blackwattle Creek. Subsequent alterations to the layout of Railway Square have resulted in extensions to the overbridge.

The line fell into disuse with the demise of Darling Harbour as a working harbour in the second half of the 20th century. Part of the railway, from Haymarket at Hay Street, near the Powerhouse Museum connecting to the Metropolitan Goods railway line to Lilyfield and Dulwich Hill, became part of the new Inner West Light Rail. Trams entering the city via the light rail line deviate from the Darling Harbour Line at Hay Street to run via surface streets to the Central station colonnade.

For a time, the remainder of the former Darling Harbour Line, from Sydney Yard to Hay Street, remained disused and functional, and was used to transfer trains to the Powerhouse Museum. Most of this section, from the Devonshire Street Tunnel to Hay Street, was converted to a pedestrianised linear park called The Goods Line in stages in 2012 and 2015.

The final part of the Darling Harbour Line, a tunnel under Railway Square, is intact but disused. There are proposals to also pedestrianise it.

=== Sydney Yard ===
The first Sydney railway workshop, constructed , was a substantial two storey sandstone building with arched openings to both floors and a slate roof. A boiler, for the production of steam, was located at the southern end of the building. By 1865, a timber extension had been constructed over a section of track to allow the locomotives to be worked on under cover. A blacksmiths forge was located in an adjacent single storey building. In contrast with the first Redfern Station building (Sydney Terminal) the main workshop building was an elaborately detailed sandstone building, with a rock-faced ashlar base, quoins and sills. The use of substantial and well-detailed sandstone buildings on the site was to continue with the construction of the twin-gabled goods shed, the Mortuary Station and finally the present station building and its approaches.

Originally the Sydney Yard occupied the area between the passenger station and the two storey workshop building. Initially, timber and corrugated iron sheds were built, however, these were soon replaced with more substantial masonry building. Gable-ended locomotive and carriage workshops were built here. Although no architectural drawings of these buildings have been located it is assumed that metal roof trusses and cast iron internal columns were used, similar to the structural system favoured in England, and later employed at Eveleigh. Of these sheds, the most elaborate was the Second Goods Shed, built in the late 1860s. The building was as, if not more, elaborate than many English examples. It was unusual, even in the 19th century, for this level of decorative detail to be employed on such a utilitarian structure as a goods shed, the standard of building obviously representing the level of importance of the yard.

Extensive facilities were required to keep the locomotives in good working order. The Sydney/Redfern yards were extended towards Elizabeth Street and the Exhibition Ground (Prince Alfred Park). Until the construction of the railway workshops at Eveleigh in the mid-1880s the majority of the maintenance work was undertaken at the Sydney/Redfern Yard. In 1884 the yards included a gasworks (), gas holder, a carriage works and the locomotive shop (by 1865). A turntable connected the now considerably extended main workshop building, one of the two blacksmiths shops and the repairing shed. All of these structures have been demolished. Further towards the park, in the area now known as the Prince Alfred Sidings were located the carpenters shop, the second blacksmiths shop and an office. These buildings are the only remnants of the Sydney Yard. Little physical evidence remains of the layout or the functioning of this once extensive railway yard as many of the structures were removed to allow for the construction of platforms 16-23 and subsequently the city electric station.

=== Mortuary station ===

The Mortuary station, or the Receiving House as it was known, was originally constructed for funeral parties, the mourners accompanying the coffin on the journey to the necropolis at Rookwood Cemetery. Most documentary sources date the building as being constructed in 1869, however, the outline of the station first appears on the 1865 MWS&amp;DB (Metropolitan Water Sewerage &amp; Drainage Board) plan. The rail lines had not yet been constructed. The inner Sydney cemetery or New Burial Ground, also known as the Sandhills or Devonshire Street station, was located in the Brickfields, a site now occupied by the main terminal building. By the 1840s this cemetery was overcrowded and a new location, in close proximity to a railway line, was required. In the early 1860s a site at Haslem&#x27;s Creek was selected for the new cemetery. To distinguish the cemetery from the surrounding residential area of Haslem&#x27;s Creek the cemetery became known as the Rookwood Necropolis. A station was constructed within the Rookwood Necropolis.

The Colonial Architect, James Barnet, designed both receiving houses (mortuary stations) in the mid 1860s. The station within the Necropolis has subsequently been relocated and modified to form the nave of All Saints Church of England, , ACT. Although both stations are Gothic Revival in style, the plan and detailing of each varies considerably. Barnet&#x27;s two station buildings were designed to celebrate the passage of the coffin to and from the train. In the Victorian Era, mourning the dead was a prolonged ritual with elaborate rules concerning behaviour and dress. The train trip to Rookwood became part of this ritual.

The regular funerary train service to the Rookwood Necropolis commenced in 1867, two years before Mortuary Central and the Rookwood Station had been completed. By 1908 there were four stations within the necropolis, named Mortuary Stations 1-4, with the Sydney receiving house being known as Mortuary Central. Mortuary Central was built by Stoddart &amp; Medway from Pyrmont sandstone and completed in March 1869. The carvings were executed by Thomas Duckett and Henry Apperly. From the variation claim submitted by the builders it would appear that a slightly larger building, with more decoration was built than originally intended. The form of the Mortuary Station, with the large porte-cochère, clearly indicates that it is not a church. A colonnade of trefoil arches and foliated capitals forms a screen to the platform. The same arch form being employed for both ends of the platform and for the octagonal porte-cochère to the west. The station building is above street level, with a flight of stairs leading to the platform level. Ramps to the north and south were used for carriages. Internally were the ticket office, two vestibules and retiring rooms.

Photographs taken in the early 1870s clearly show the decorative detail of the building. Two colours of stone were employed, a darker shade of the arches and the surrounds to the medallions, the lighter shade being reserved for the ashlar work. The two shades of stone were employed internally in the same manner. The arcade covering the platform is very elaborate, with its curved queen post truss roof, with ripple iron above following the curve, blind arcading to the west that mirrors the eastern arcade, and geometric tiled floor. Even the platform benches follow the Gothic Revival theme of the design, resembling pews. This platform would have contrasted with the more utilitarian Redfern station building, designed by John Whitton and constructed in the early 1870s.

The stonework of the Mortuary Station was very delicately worked, with a number of different foliage motifs forming the capitals, the trefoil spandrel panel within the main arches and the medallions. A star and zig-zag motif was used on the soffit of the arch, ball flowers on the cornice brackets and a zig-zag on the cornice. The original roof covering was slate, with a pattern of half round and diamond slates being employed at the ridge and above the eaves. The octagonal porte-cochère terminates in a bell-cote, whose detail is a miniature of the main trefoil arch and medallion motif. The bellcote was roofed with lead. Decorative metalwork is also employed, as finals, as a cresting and as balustrades. A leaf motif was used for the balustrade to the porte-cochère and repeated in the panels of the elaborate timber gates that lead to the platform. A palisade fence that stepped down to follow the slope and matching gates separated the station from the street and a picket fence lined the ramps. The spire of Mortuary Station (the Bellcote) was a distinctive townscape element that could be seen from the Exhibition Grounds (Prince Alfred Park) and from Sydney University.

The arcade detail of Mortuary Central, with its pointed trefoil arches, medallions and foliated capitals, is reminiscent of the hotel at St Pancras Station by Sir George Gilbert Scott, designed in 1865 and constructed in 1868–73. There are few other station buildings, either in Australia or the United Kingdom, with this level of decorative detail. The construction of special mortuary stations is rare, with no other examples having been located. The Mortuary station became part of the rail complex at Central after the new station was constructed in 1906, although it remained physically separate from the new station buildings.

By the late 1970s, the station had deteriorated, slates were missing from the roof and the stonework was covered in graffiti. A restoration program was undertaken in 1983.

=== Railway Institute ===

The Railway Institute on Chalmers Street was constructed as a venue for the railway employees, providing a setting for both educational activities and social functions. It is reputed to be the first railway institute in Australia and provided a range of services for railway employees such as evening classes and a library. A competition was held for the design, which was won by the architect Henry Robinson. It is a Queen Anne Revival style building, based on English prototypes such as the London Board Schools. The design was the first use of Marseille roof tiles for public buildings in Australia. Many public buildings were designed by competition , during the period of transition between the Colonial and Government Architects Offices. The practice was abandoned in the mid-1890s due to the partiality of the judges.

When the Railway Institute was constructed in 1891, the building was located on the corner of Devonshire Street and Elizabeth Street, at the northeastern corner of the Sydney rail yard. The surrounding streets and the carriage way have subsequently been modified. A carriage-way lead to the porte-cochère, enabling people attending social functions to enter the building without getting wet. In addition to the library there were two halls, a large hall, with a stage, and a smaller hall on the ground floor. The detail of this space is largely intact and there are few examples of small scale halls of this period remaining in Sydney. A single-storey addition to the building, designed by the government architect, Walter Liberty Vernon, was added in 1898 to the southeast of the main building.

Classes, such as engineering drafting, and examinations for railway employees, were held in the institute. The building was also utilised during emergencies such as the 1919 influenza epidemic when women volunteers manufactured face masks (for railway employees). There are few examples of Institutes of this period that provided such a high level of facilities for the benefit of the employees. The names on the honour board reads as a &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; of railway personalities.

=== Fire and renovation===

In May 2023, there was a large fire across the road from the Central Station upgrade works. The fire caused significant damage, including from water, to the new Sydney metro station entrance. The station entrance was repaired and was eventually reopened in November 2023.

== Station layout ==
Central Railway Station has buildings concentrated on its northern boundaries that are fed by large rail yards behind. Together they form part of the fabric of the city of Sydney and form boundaries to its inner suburbs. The location of this station is on land that has been in continuous government use since the commencement of European settlement. Various forms of public transport have radiated from this site since 1855.

=== Sydney Terminal building ===

The most prominent part of Sydney Central Station, visible from many parts of the City and surrounding area, is the 1906 sandstone main terminal building, referred to as the &quot;Sydney Terminal Building&quot; by railway staff. It is sited to dominate its surroundings and to mark the importance of the railways and its service to the state and the city.

The main concourse and platforms are elevated above the surrounding roads. This elevated siting also permits the use of the topography to gain road access to more than one level enabling the development of an extensive subterranean luggage network and separation of differing modes of transport. The commanding position of the Terminus with large areas of open space sloping away from the building continues the public domain of Railway Square whilst maintaining a clear vista of the Terminus from the surrounding area. The Terminus, and in part the Parcels Post Office, create a formal edge to Railway Square.

On the main Eddy Avenue façade, the Terminus comprises a colonnade and porte-cochère, which originally provided an undercover area for passengers transferring to and from trams. After the removal of the original Sydney tram network, the upper level colonnade was used by motor vehicles, but it is now again used by trams on the Inner West Light Rail.

The main concourse, originally called the &quot;Main Assembly platform&quot; and today known as the &quot;Grand Concourse&quot;, is located on the upper level and is the centre of the Terminus, around which all of the ancillary functions, such as refreshment rooms, waiting rooms and the booking hall, were arranged. As originally built, the main terminal building also had terraces or &quot;decks&quot; on the east and west sides, which were accessible by vehicles. The main concourse &quot;platform&quot; was accessed from both the East and West deck. The main concourse is dominated by a large vaulted roof over the concourse and elaborate masonry, primarily Sydney sandstone.

The station opened on 5 August 1906 with 11 platforms, but was soon expanded to 15, and by 1913 had 19. As part of the construction of the electrified city railway in the 1920s, the existing station was cut back to 15 platforms with new platforms built to the east of the existing station. As part of the project, platforms 10 to 15 were electrified, with platforms 1 to 9 following in 1956.The current 15 Sydney Terminal platforms run perpendicular to the main station concourse and all are dead ended with the buffer stop. They are arranged as seven double platforms and one single platform, each with an awning, servicing a total of 15 tracks. Platforms 1–3 are for country and interstate services, while the remainder are for interurban services.

Platforms 1–10 have a centre run-round track, which was for locomotive-hauled trains. It enabled the locomotive to uncouple from its train and either depart or re-couple on the other end to pull the train to the next destination. There was extreme pressure on the speed to ready a train for the next destination due to the lack of platform space and a steady growth of rail patronage. These centre lines are now used for storage of electric rail car sets in off peak times. The platforms feature long timber-framed canopies over some of the platforms (incorporating Howe trusses). Timber was used in lieu of steel because of the high cost at the time of importing steel.

The only locomotive hauled trains now using Sydney Terminal are the Indian Pacific and special trains which usually use Platform 1. Platform 1 has always been the main out of Sydney Station with the longest platform. Platforms 1 and 2–3 were lengthened to their present length in 1962 covering the skylights to the Devonshire Street Subway for diesel hauled trains like the Southern Aurora. All long-distance NSW TrainLink XPT and Xplorer services and the Great Southern Rail &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; terminate at Central. These generally use Platforms 1 to 3, although when the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; is in the station occupying both Platforms 2 and 3, some NSW TrainLink regional services use Platforms 4 to 12.

=== Central Electric Station ===

To the east of the Sydney Terminal building are ten further platforms, used by suburban Sydney Trains services and by a limited number of NSW TrainLink intercity services during peak hours.

As part of the construction of the electrified city railway in the 1920s and the electrification and expansions of the Sydney suburban lines, the existing station was cut back to 15 platforms with new Platforms 16 to 23 built on the station&#x27;s eastern side in 1926. The Electric Station was part of the construction works overseen by Bradfield that included the excavation of the tunnels, the building of the Harbour Bridge, and electrification of the suburban rail network.

The platforms continue north via a six-track viaduct paralleling Elizabeth Street built to the north, passing over Campbell Street and Hay Street, and ending at Goulburn Street where it enters tunnels to connect with the City Circle underground rail system and the North Shore over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

Platforms 16 to 23 are also elevated, but are served by a lower level concourse at street level known as &quot;North Concourse&quot;. Railway staff refer to this part of the station as the &quot;Central Electric Station&quot;, or &quot;Central Electric System&quot;. The two stations were managed and staffed as separate entities. This section of the station is also referred to as the &quot;suburban&quot; platforms. There are two major pedestrian entrances to Central Electric: one at Elizabeth Street and one at the top of Eddy Avenue ramp. Both are constructed of Maroubra sandstone with classical detailing.

The four island platforms allow eight trains to use the station, four trains in each direction. South of these new platforms, a series of flying junctions were built. This involved the four southbound tracks passing beneath the northbound tracks with a series of diamond crossings allowing trains to cross lines without impeding trains traveling in the opposite direction.

In February 1926, Platforms 18 and 19 of the steam station were wired for electric trains with a demonstration run from Sydney to Hurstville. This wiring was transferred to Platforms 21 and 23 and Platforms 14 and 15 were wired for Bankstown electric train services commencing October 1926 and later worked into St James. As the Homebush electrification was completed, Platforms 17 and 18 were wired. Electric trains to Hornsby via the main line commenced on 21 January 1929. Trains to Hornsby used Platforms 16 and 18. Steam services to Parramatta and Liverpool were converted to electric in November 1929. Western electric trains began operating through to Wynyard from 28 February 1932.

Two further underground platforms were built as part of the Eastern Suburbs Railway, bringing the total number of platforms in the suburban section to ten. Construction commenced in 1948 but the line was not finished until 1979. While the plans called for four platforms, two (for the Southern Suburbs line) were intended to be used in the future and have never been brought into service. They were for a time used for archival storage by the railways.

===Metro platforms and Central Walk===
Construction began in 2018 on two new underground platforms as part of the Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest project, and a new landmark underground concourse called Central Walk, which connects the suburban, intercity and metro platforms.

Central Walk was partially opened in November 2022 and was fully opened in April 2023. Central Walk provides lift and escalator access to the suburban platforms, which previously had only lift and stair access.

The metro platforms were built beneath Platforms 13 and 14, which were closed for the duration of construction. In November and December 2018, Platforms 12-13 and 14-15 were demolished. A temporary Platform 12 was erected in January 2019. The metro platforms opened on 19 August 2024. From opening, the long and tall escalators between Central Walk and the metro platforms are the longest in the southern hemisphere, overtaking the previous record of long escalators at Perth&#x27;s Airport Central railway station.

===Indicator board===

When opened, Central station had an indicator board with 22 vertical panels. It was replaced in June 1982 by computer screens with the original indicator board conserved by the Powerhouse Museum. In June 2015, a new elevated indicator board was installed on the main concourse on the same sandstone base as the original board.

===Devonshire Street Tunnel===
After Central was built in 1906, Devonshire Street, to the north of the old station, became an underpass, now called the Devonshire Street Tunnel or Devonshire Street Subway. The underpass allows pedestrians to access the eastern &quot;suburban&quot; section from Railway Square and Chalmers Street. To the west, the tunnel continues under Railway Square and connects to The Goods Line – the former Darling Harbour railway line which has been converted to a park and pedestrian pathway to Ultimo and Darling Harbour.

===Railway Square===

The western side of the Sydney Terminal building leads down to Railway Square, originally Central Square, at the junction of George and Pitt streets. Although Railway Square no longer signifies the entrance to the interior of the colony, it has always channelled traffic from the southern parts of the city and out west to Parramatta. From the building of the first railway terminus at Devonshire Street in 1855, it was an important focus for the arrival of country persons to the city and later commuters into the city.

The importance of the relationship between the Sydney Terminus and Railway Square is reflected in the elevations of the main building. Here the dominating presence of the clock tower, completed in 1921, marked the arrival and departure times, the beginning and end of a workman&#x27;s day. Before the spread of the suburbs, a workman could make a return trip home to eat dinner in his lunch hour.

===Parcel Office building===

To the west of the southern end of Platform 1 is the Inwards Parcel Office. This was the loading dock for parcels and mail from the post office. The mail was loaded via a tunnel from the post office. The Parcels Post Office is an unusual urban building, being designed to be viewed from three sides. Its symmetrical, boldly modelled elevations and its siting in the middle of an open space give it the presence of a public monument or sculpture. Due to the oblique road approaches to the Railway Square this building forms a strong element within the Sydney Terminal Precinct.

The Parcel Office building is now an apartment-hotel, managed by Adina.

=== Sydney Yards ===
South of the Devonshire Street Tunnel, a large rail yard extends to the Cleveland Street Bridge, linking the Sydney Terminal platforms (1–15) with the railway lines extending west. The track layout to Platforms 1–15 have remained virtually unchanged since they were originally laid out in 1906. Major items from its period as a steam locomotive hauled train yard have been removed. These include the Eastern Carriage shed demolished in 1986, Coal Stages, and Engine Docks at the head of each platform. Ash pits and water columns that were part of the yard have also been removed. There is only one &quot;yard controller&quot; remaining within the Yard. Previously, at least two Signal Boxes would have been located in the Yard at any one time, but these have been removed due to the mechanical interlocking system being computerised and pneumatically operated.

The Yard buildings have been altered significantly since the Eastern Carriage Shed was demolished. This large shed divided the central yard from the central electric lines. The land where the shed once stood lay vacant until the construction projects begun in 2018. Remaining structures signifying the division of the yard are the Cleaners Amenities and the former Timetable Office with the garden. The Rail Yard connects to the passenger platforms of Sydney Terminal which are as originally designed and built, with the infrastructure for steam locomotives having been removed - these being water columns between each track near the buffers. However, the concrete plinths remain.

The open space of the rail yards adds to the experience of arrival to the city from the north and south by opening up vistas to the imposing Sydney Terminal with its landmark tower. This open space permits the imposing Terminus and its Tower to be visible when viewed from a distance much as it was intended when originally built. The Terminus and its approaches define formal urban spaces in the city fabric.

=== Western Yard ===
The Western Rail Yard lies west of the westernmost main line track leading to Platform 1 (No. 1 Main Line), and extends to the Regent Street boundary to the west, Devonshire Street Subway to the north and Cleveland Street Bridge to the south. Until the construction project begun in 2018, the track layout of this yard had remained virtually unchanged since 1906. The rail sidings that take up the bulk of the land area were known as the &quot;Botany Road Yards&quot;. These siding lines are still in service but are seldom used. The lines were used as storage yards for making up passenger trains and for goods being loaded and unloaded at the Parcel and Goods Sidings. This was a major activity at the Sydney Terminal that has become obsolete due to the introduction of technological changes such as fixed sets of rail cars, and the phasing out of locomotive-pulled trains. The Darling Harbour Line branch line formerly cut through the precinct providing access to Darling Harbour Goods Yard. This is no longer in use, and part of the former line is now the Goods Line, a lineal park connected to Devonshire Street Tunnel.

The underpass and overbridge date from 1855. The Mortuary Station with its siding and platform is on the boundary of this rail yard, facing Regent Street, and is visible from Railway Square because of the low scale of buildings in the Western Yard. Rail access to the Mortuary Station was from the main lines near the Cleveland Street Bridge, and has remained in service since the mid-1860s.

Nearer to the present main station building were the West Carriage Shed, demolished in 1999. This was the last remaining carriage shed at Central Station. The six rail lines that enter the shed were connected to the yard through tunnels at the end of Platform 1.

The Yard was designed for locomotive-hauled trains. As this technology has gone out of use except for the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; and Special Trains the yard has little present functional use. With locomotive hauled trains the trains were marshalled for running in one direction. It has the locomotive at the head of the train and a brake van near the rear. This meant that trains when ending their journey had to be remarshalled before commencing their journey out of Sydney Station. The introduction of trains with driving positions at both ends of the train no longer require this process. As the station originally handled locomotive hauled passenger trains for suburban, country and interstate service this activity was considerable. Most of the steam loco facilities and trackwork has been removed. The decline in shunting and the removal of coal and water storage has seen a reduction in the level of activity in the yard. Although it has progressed through various configurations, the landscape has maintained the same ground level since 1856 with its final layout being enlarged in 1906 by the removal of some houses and the realignment of Regent Street to its present format.

===Parcel Dock===
The Parcel Dock was physically connected with the main station complex and had four platforms (two dock platforms) for the use of mail trains. Due to the decline of parcel delivery by rail, this was cut back to serve a motorail loading ramp (for the loading of automobiles) for the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot;. The space where the mail sidings were is now a Youth Hostels Association hostel named the Sydney Railway Square YHA. The hostel rooms are modelled on old train carriages.

=== Former Prince Alfred Sidings ===
The Prince Alfred Sidings were formerly to the south of Platform 23 and on the eastern perimeter of the site, making up the boundary with Prince Alfred Park to the southeast. The Prince Alfred or &quot;PA&quot; electric car sidings were built only after the flyovers. Prior to the construction of the electric lines, the yard was a goods yard containing Produce and Goods Sheds as well as the first carriage shed. All have been removed from this precinct. The Yard is a small part of the original Sydney yard, of which a number of buildings remain which date from 1870. Later additional buildings are associated with the 1926 Electric Suburban System. The construction of the electric system reduced the width of the Prince Alfred Sidings, and trains within this yard needed to be protected because of vandalism. The Electric Sub Station is part of the 1926 electrification works and is linked with the sub station at the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It also contains air compressors for the operation of pneumatic points within the Yard and the City Circle Lines. A retaining wall forms the boundary with Prince Alfred Park; it has been incorporated into the rear wall of the blacksmiths workshops. A number of mature trees are growing on the boundary, the largest being a Moreton Bay Fig at least 80 years old.

The Prince Alfred sidings were closed in August 1995 and then demolished to make way for the Airport line, which enters a tunnel built into the retaining wall of Prince Alfred Park.

==Platforms==
Central serves all Sydney Trains suburban lines except for the T5 Cumberland Line. The platforms are numbered from 1 to 25, with 1 being the westernmost platform and 25 being one of the easternmost. Platforms 1 to 14 are above ground terminating at the Sydney Terminal Building; Platforms 16 to 23 are above ground and serve the through-running suburban station to the east of the main building; Platforms 24 and 25 are underground and serve the Eastern Suburbs Railway; Platforms 26 and 27 serve the Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line and are located underground beneath Platforms 13 and 14.
The numbers for Platforms 26 and 27 formerly referred to never-completed &quot;ghost platforms&quot;, formerly used for archival document storage and now contains Sydney Metro communications and power rooms. These platforms are located underground, above Platforms 24 and 25; all four platforms were constructed as part of the original vision for the Eastern Suburbs Railway. Platform 15 was permanently closed in September 2018 to facilitate Sydney Metro construction and the expansion of adjacent platforms.
== Connecting services ==
=== Light rail ===

Central Grand Concourse is the eastern terminus of the L1 Dulwich Hill Line that operates to Chinatown, Darling Harbour, Pyrmont and the inner west suburbs. The light rail stop is in an outside concourse area, near the main waiting area and departure hall. This area was used for trams until 1958, when the service was withdrawn. It was known as Railway Colonnade and then Central. Light rail services operate in a clockwise direction, whereas the trams operated in an anti-clockwise direction.

The L2 Randwick and L3 Kingsford lines between Circular Quay and Kingsford or Randwick also run via Central. Its nearest stops are the Haymarket, at Rawson Place to the northwest, and Central Chalmers Street, on Chalmers Street to the east.
=== Bus services ===

Many bus services depart from the adjacent Eddy Avenue or from the nearby Elizabeth Street or Railway Square.
=== Coach services ===
Long distance coaches depart from the western forecourt and Pitt Street:
*Australia Wide Coaches operates services to Orange
*Firefly Express operates services to Melbourne and Adelaide via Melbourne
*Greyhound Australia operates services to Brisbane, Byron Bay, Canberra and Melbourne
*Murrays operates services to Canberra
*Port Stephens Coaches operates services to Fingal Bay via Nelson Bay
*Premier Motor Service operates services to Brisbane and Eden

<text>Leo Robin (April 6, 1895 – December 29, 1984) was an American composer, lyricist and songwriter. He is probably best known for collaborating with Ralph Rainger on the 1938 Oscar-winning song &quot;Thanks for the Memory,&quot; sung by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross in the film &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;, and with Jule Styne on &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. 

==Biography==
Robin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. His father was Max Robin, a salesman. Leo&#x27;s mother was Fannie Finkelpearl Robin. He studied at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and at Carnegie Tech&#x27;s drama school. He later worked as a reporter and as a publicist.

Robin&#x27;s first hits came in 1926 with the Broadway production &quot;By the Way&quot;, with hits in several other musicals immediately following, such as &quot;Bubbling Over&quot; (1926), &quot;Hit the Deck, Judy&quot; (1927), and &quot;Hello Yourself&quot; (1928). In 1932, Robin went out to Hollywood to work for Paramount Pictures. His principal collaborator was composer Ralph Rainger, together they became one of the leading film songwriting duos of the 1930s and early 1940s, writing over 50 hits. Robin and Rainger worked together until Rainger&#x27;s death in a plane crash on October 23, 1942. Robin continued to collaborate with many other composers over the years, including Harold Arlen, Vincent Youmans, Sam Coslow, Richard A. Whiting, Jule Styne, Harry Warren and Nacio Herb Brown. Leo Robin collaborated with Rainger on the 1938 Oscar-winning song &quot;Thanks for the Memory,&quot; sung by Bob Hope in the film &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;, which was to become Hope&#x27;s signature tune. Robin and Styne wrote the 1949 score for &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, including &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, a signature song for Carol Channing and later Marilyn Monroe.

Robin collaborated on the score for the 1955 musical film &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; with Styne, then officially retired from the movie industry. He is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1972. Robin wrote many popular songs, mostly for film and television, including &quot;Louise,&quot; &quot;Beyond the Blue Horizon&quot; (both songs co-written by Richard A. Whiting), &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; and &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;.

==Death==
Robin died of heart failure in Woodland Hills, California at the age of 84, and was interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>Balakrishnan Kuttiraman Nair, more popularly known as Balan K. Nair (4 April 1933 26 August 2000) was an Indian actor known for his roles in Malayalam cinema. Although he appeared as a villain in most films, he was also noted for his performances in strong character roles. He emerged as one of the top villain of Malayalam cinema in the second half of the 1970s and played some of the best villain characters in Malayalam films during that period.

Balakrishnan Kuttiraman (Balan K.) Nair was the eldest of four children of Idakkulam Kizhakke Veettil Kuttiraman Nair, a store owner, and Devaki Amma, a housewife in 1933 in the village of Chemancheri near Quilandy. His parents died when he was young and hence he had to take care of his siblings and discontinue his studies at eighth grade. Prior to his entry in films, he worked as a mechanic in Kozhikode and owned a metal workshop. He started his acting career at the age of 14. At that time he was associated with Sangamam Theatre in Kozhikode, &quot;Muppathunkavu&quot; troupe, &quot;Kozhikodan&quot; drama troupes and his own drama troupe &quot;Subash Theaters&quot;. After his marriage to Sharadha, he moved to Shoranur in Palakkad. His son Meghanathan is also an actor who passed away in 2024.

Balan K. Nair died of Multiple myeloma at Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram on 26 August 2000, aged 67.

==Film career==
Balan K. Nair made his debut in the film &quot;Nizhalattam&quot;, directed by A. Vincent in 1970. Prior to acting in Malayalam movies, he worked as a stunt double for Bollywood star Dev Anand. He acted in more than 300 films in Malayalam, mostly as a villain. He won the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor in 1974 and 1978 for his roles in &quot;Adhiti&quot; and &quot;Thacholi Ambu&quot;. He won the National Film Award for Best Actor for his role as a reformed military officer in the 1981 film &quot;Oppol&quot;.

Some of his other well-known movies are &quot;Ee Naadu&quot;, &quot;Aaryan&quot;, and &quot;Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha&quot;.

<doc id="576575" wikidata="Q191763" url="?curid=576575" title="Itsukushima Shrine">
<text>is a Shinto shrine on the island of Itsukushima (popularly known as Miyajima), best known for its &quot;floating&quot; &quot;torii&quot;. It is in the city of Hatsukaichi, in Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan, accessible from the mainland by ferry at Miyajimaguchi Station. The shrine complex is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Japanese government has designated several buildings and possessions as National Treasures.

The Itsukushima shrine is one of Japan&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions. It is most famous for its dramatic gate, or &quot;torii&quot; on the outskirts of the shrine, the sacred peaks of Mount Misen, extensive forests, and its ocean view. The shrine complex itself consists of two main buildings: the Honsha shrine and the Sessha Marodo-jinja, as well as 17 other different buildings and structures that help to distinguish it.

==History==

=== Origin ===
&quot;Itsukushima jinja&quot; was the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) of Aki Province.

This shrine is one of the &quot;Three Great Shrines of Aki Province&quot;, along with Take Shrine and Hayatani Shrine.

The first &quot;torii&quot; on the site is said to have been erected in 593, supposedly by Saeki Kuramoto during the reign of Empress Suiko (592–628 CE). Although a &quot;torii&quot; has been in place at the site since 1168, the current structure dates to 1875. The present shrine has been popularly attributed to Taira no Kiyomori, a prominent noble of the Imperial Court and later Chancellor (Daijō-daijin), who contributed heavily to the construction of the shrine during his time as governor of Aki Province in 1168. Another renowned patron of the shrine was Mōri Motonari, lord of Chōshū Domain, who was responsible for rebuilding the in 1571. As a result of waging war against Sue Takafusa there in 1555, Motonari is said to have tainted the island&#x27;s grounds by battling on the island. Spilling blood violated the strict taboos meant to preserve the sacred purity associated with Shinto shrines. The only surviving structure in Itsukushima shrine from the Kamakura period is the Kyakuden or &quot;Guest-God&#x27;s Shrine&quot;.

=== Kiyomori ===
It was not uncommon during the 12th century for the nobility to build shrines or take on other architectural projects in order to &quot;reflect their power and splendor.&quot; The Taira clan are known specifically for their involvement in maritime trade with the Song dynasty (960–1279) and for attempting to monopolize overseas trade along the Inland Sea.

Kiyomori was at the height of his power when he established the Taira dominion over the island. He &quot;ordered construction of the main hall of Itsukushima shrine as a display of reverence for the tutelary god of navigation and to serve as a base for maritime activities...&quot; Miyajima soon became the Taira family shrine. Supposedly, Kiyomori chose the location also for the reason to further establish himself in the Heian aristocracy as one who deviated from the social norms of Shinto pilgrimage . He lavished great wealth upon Itsukushima, and he enjoyed showing the place to his friends and colleagues, or even to royal personages...&quot;

It is also said that Kiyomori rebuilt the shrine on account of a dream he had of an old monk who promised him dominion over Japan if he constructed a shrine on the island of Miyajima, and pay homage to its kami who are enshrined there for his success in life. The renovations funded by the Taira allowed for Itsukushima to &quot;grow into an important religious complex.&quot;

==Religious significance==
The Itsukushima shrine is dedicated to the three daughters of Susano-o no Mikoto: Ichikishimahime no mikoto, Tagorihime no mikoto, and Tagitsuhime no mikoto. Otherwise known as the &quot;sanjoshin&quot; or &quot;three female deities&quot;, these Shinto deities are the goddesses of seas and storms. Kiyomori believed the goddesses to be &quot;manifestations of Kannon,&quot; therefore the island was understood as the home of the bodhisattva. In Japanese, the word Itsukushima translates to &quot;island dedicated to the gods.&quot; The island itself is also considered to be a god, which is why the shrine was built on the outskirts of the island. Adding to its sanctity, Mount Misen is the tallest peak at about 1,755 feet. Tourists can either hike or take a ropeway to the top.

Its treasures include the celebrated Heike Nōkyō, or &quot;Sutras dedicated by the House of Taira.&quot; These consist of thirty-two scrolls, on which the Lotus, Amida, and Heart sutras have been copied by Kiyomori, his sons, and other members of the family, each completing the transcription of one scroll, and it was &quot;decorated with silver, gold, and mother-of-pearl by himself [Kiyomori] and other members of his clan.&quot;

Originally Itsukushima was a pure Shinto shrine &quot;where no births or deaths were allowed to cause pollution&quot;. Because the island itself has been considered sacred, commoners were not allowed to set foot on it throughout much of its history to maintain its purity. Retaining the purity of the shrine is so important that since 1878, no deaths or births have been permitted near it. To this day, pregnant women are supposed to retreat to the mainland as the day of delivery approaches, as are the terminally ill or the very elderly whose passing has become imminent. Burials on the island are forbidden. To allow pilgrims to approach, the shrine was built like a pier over the water, so that it appeared to float, separate from the land. The red entrance gate, or &quot;torii&quot;, was built over the water for much the same reason. Commoners had to steer their boats through the &quot;torii&quot; before approaching the shrine.

== Architecture ==
Japan has gone to great lengths to preserve the twelfth-century-style architecture of the Shrine throughout history. The shrine was designed and built according to the &quot;Shinden-zukuri&quot; style, equipped with pier-like structures over the Matsushima bay in order to create the illusion of floating on the water, separate from island, which could be approached by the devout &quot;like a palace on the sea.&quot; This idea of intertwining architecture and nature is reflective of a popular trend during the 16th century as well as the Heian period in which Japanese structures tended to &quot;follow after their environment,&quot; often allowing trees, water, and other forms of natural beauty to enter into the decor of homes and buildings. That led to a far more intimate relationship between the two.


The most recognizable and celebrated feature of the Itsukushima shrine, is its -tall vermilion otorii gate (&quot;great gate&quot;), built of decay-resistant camphor wood. The placement of an additional leg in front of and behind each main pillar identifies the &quot;torii&quot; as reflecting the style of &quot;Ryōbu Shintō&quot; (dual Shinto), a medieval school of esoteric Japanese Buddhism associated with the Shingon Sect. The &quot;torii&quot; appears to be floating only at high tide. When the tide is low, it is approachable by foot from the island. Gathering shellfish near the gate is popular at low tide. At night, powerful lights on the shore illuminate the structure. The current &quot;torii&quot; dates to 1875, although there has been one on that site since 1168.

Shinto architecture has many distinct parts, most of which include the shrine&#x27;s (main hall) and the unusually long &quot;haiden&quot; (main oratory), and its equally long &quot;heiden&quot; (offertory hall). The &quot;is an eight-by-four bay structure with a kirizuma roof surfaced in cypress bark.&quot; Its walls are decorated in white stucco, and were constructed using a process requiring fifteen coats of white stucco, with vermilion woodwork.

Extending from the sides of the &quot;haraiden&quot; of the main shrine is a &quot;noh&quot; stage which dates from 1590. &quot;Noh&quot; theater performances have long been used to pay homage to the gods through the ritual acting out of key events in Shinto myth.

On September 5, 2004, the shrine was severely damaged by Typhoon Songda. The boardwalks and roof were partially destroyed, and the shrine was temporarily closed for repairs. Today anyone can visit the shrine at a cost of 300 yen.

<text>The Pudgalavāda (Sanskrit; English: &quot;Personalism&quot;; Pali: Puggalavāda; ; ) was a Buddhist philosophical view and also refers to a group of Nikaya Buddhist schools (mainly known as Vātsīputrīyas) that arose from the Sthavira nikāya. The school is believed to have been founded by the elder Vātsīputra in the third century BCE. They were a widely influential school in India and became particularly popular during the reign of emperor Harshavadana (606–647 CE). Harsha&#x27;s sister Rajyasri was said to have joined the school as a nun. According to Dan Lusthaus, they were &quot;one of the most popular mainstream Buddhist sects in India for more than a thousand years.&quot;

==Doctrines==

=== Pudgala thesis ===
The Pudgalavādins asserted that while there is no ātman, there exists a pudgala (person) or sattva (being) which is neither a conditioned dharma nor an unconditioned dharma. This doctrine of the person was their method of accounting for karma, rebirth, and nirvana. For the Pudgalavādins, the pudgala was what underwent rebirth through successive lives in samsara and what experiences nirvana. They defended this view through philosophical argument as well as scriptural citation. According to Thiện Châu and Richard Gombrich, they used the Bharaharasutta as a major reference for their view. This text states that the person (pudgala) is the bearer of the five aggregates, and that the taking up of them is craving and suffering:

The Kathavatthu also mentions that the Pudgalavādins relied on the following statements by the Buddha: &quot;there is a person who exerts for his own good&quot; and &quot;there appears a person who is reborn for the good and happiness of many, for showing compassion to the world of beings&quot;. The Pudgalavādins held that this person was &quot;inexpressible&quot; and indeterminate in its relation to the five aggregates and could not be said to be neither the same as the aggregates nor different. However, the person could not be denied entirely, for if this were so, nothing would get reborn and nothing would be the object of loving-kindness meditation. Thus, according to L.S. Cousins:The difference is that for the Voidist the person is a label for the aggregates experiences as objects of consciousness whereas for the personalist the relationship between the person and those objects cannot be described as either the same nor different.Thus this pudgala was the subject of experiences, the doer of wholesome and unwholesome actions, and the experiencer of karma, transmigration and nirvana. Yet it was also &quot;indefinable&quot; (&quot;avaktavya&quot;), neither a conditioned (samskrta) nor an unconditioned dharma (nirvana) and neither the same as nor different from the five aggregates. However, as Thiện Châu notes in his survey of their literature, the Pudgalavādins carefully developed this theory especially to be compatible with anatman and the middle way and thus the pudgala is &quot;not an absolute reality totally separated from compounded things.&quot;

The &quot;Abhidharmakosha&quot; shows how the Pudgalavadins explained their theory by using the analogy of fire and fuel. The five aggregates are the fuel and the pudgala the fire. The fire exists as long as there is fuel, but it is not the same as the fuel and has properties that the fuel does not. They are co-existent and the fuel (aggregates) are the support for the fire (pudgala), and thus are not the same nor wholly different. For the Pudgalavadins, If one says that the person is the &quot;same&quot; as the aggregates (the reductionist Buddhist view of other schools), this is like saying fire and fuel are the same thing, which is one mistake. On the other hand, if one says that fire and fuel are totally different, this is like saying fire does not depend on fuel, a second mistake (related to non-Buddhist views). Thus they took a middle road between these and argued for a person which is neither identical to the aggregates nor different from them. They sought to refute the view of other Buddhists that the aggregates and the person were the same. They held that, at death when the aggregates are destroyed, the person would then also be destroyed, thus not be reborn. They also believed it contradicted the Buddha&#x27;s words i.e. &quot;the bearer of the burden&quot; exists.

The Kathavatthu also mentions that the pudgala can be likened to what is called a being (sattva) and also to what is called jiva (life force), but that it is neither identical nor different from the body (kaya). One Pudgalavadin text explains the nature of this relationship as being based on clinging or appropriation (upadana):The designation of appropriation (upadana-prajñapti) is the designation of life (jiva) (which is) internal appropriation (upadana) in the present and is composed of the aggregates (skandha), elements (dhatu) and domains (ayatana); that is to say that the phenomena of appropriation concerning the internal life in the present, which is formed by compounded things - (samskara) and the fetters is what is called the designation of appropriation.The Pudgalavādins also seem to have held that the liberated person exists even after paranirvana in a state of supreme bliss, or as Thiện Châu notes, they saw nirvana as &quot;a transcendental domain&quot; and an &quot;existence in the beyond&quot;.

=== Three designations of the pudgala ===
According to the Pudgalavādin text known as the &quot;Traidharmakasastra&quot;, the pudgala can be designated in three ways, called the three &quot;prajñaptis&quot;:

# The pudgala designated by the bases (&quot;asraya-prajiñapta-pudgala&quot;). This refers to the person which cannot be said to be identical to the aggregates or different to them. Thich Thien Chau names this as &quot;the essential factor that unifies a person&#x27;s life processes. Stated otherwise, it is the pudgala that appropriates and sustains a body for a certain amount of time.&quot;
# The pudgala designated by transmigration (&quot;sankrama-prajiñapta-pudgala&quot;), refers to the fact that an individual cannot be said to be the same nor different to who they were in a past life and will be in the future. This allows for a subject which is karmically responsible for their actions. According to the Pudgalavadins, if there is a continuity in between lifetimes, there must be the possessor of that continuity as well as that which individuates a person from others and is the subject of experiences, this is the pudgala.
# The pudgala designated by cessation (&quot;nirodha-prajiñapta-pudgala&quot;), which refers to the fact that after death, a Buddha cannot be said to be existent, non-existent, both or neither.

Regarding the first form of designation, Dan Lusthaus adds that:If the appropriator is something different from the skandhas themselves, then there is a sixth skandha, which is doctrinally impermissible. If the skandhas appropriate themselves, that leads to a vicious cycle of infinite regress. Hence, the Vātsīputrīya argue, the nominal person (pudgala) is neither the same as nor different from the skandhas. It is a heuristic fiction that avoids these unwarranted consequences and lends coherence by also corresponding to how actual persons experience themselves—that is, as distinct individuals continuous with, but not absolutely identical to or reducible to, their own pasts and futures.Lusthaus also explains their reasoning for the second and third designations as follows:But what remains constant or continuous between such [past and future] lives? If it is a self-same invariant identity, then this would indeed be a case of atmavada, a view the Vātsīputrīyas, like all Buddhists, reject. In what sense would someone be the same or different from the person in one&#x27;s previous life? If completely different, then to posit a continuity between them is incoherent. If the same, then their real discontinuities are ignored, leading to a form of eternalism, another impermissible view for Buddhists. Hence, they are neither the same nor different, but linked by a fictional pudgala. Finally, Buddhist practice leads to nirvana; but who attains this? If there is an integral individual that ceases on attaining nirvana, then this would entail the unwarranted view of annihilationalism. If there is no cessation of the karmic individual, then there is no nirvana. Both extremes, though implicit in standard Buddhist formulations, render Buddhism itself incoherent, a problem only solved, the Vātsīputrīyas argue, if one admits the fictional pudgala implicit in standard Buddhist doctrine.With this system, Pudgalavādins held that they could explain karmic moral retribution and personal identity by positing an ineffable (&quot;avaktavya&quot;) dharma that avoids falling into the extremes of annihilation (&quot;ucceda&quot;) and eternity (&quot;sasvata&quot;). One Pudgalavada text affirms that this doctrine is a middle way thus:If the pudgala could be described in terms of existence or non-existence, one would fall into nihilism (ucchedadristi) or eternalism (sasvatadrsti), but the Buddha does not allow us to uphold there two opinions. If one says that the pudgala does not exist, that is committing a fault in the order of the questions to be avoided. That expression is not justified. Why? If one affirms that no pudgala exists, that is a fake view (mithyadrsti). If (on the contrary), one affirms that the pudgala exists (conditionally), that is a right view (samyagdrsti). That is why it is possible to say that the pudgala exists.

=== Criticism ===
Because they felt that Vātsīputrīya views were close to the view of a self or atman, they were sharply criticized by the Vibhajjavadins (a record of this is found in the Theravadin &quot;Kathavatthu&quot;), as well as by the Sarvastivadins (In the &quot;Vijñanakaya&quot;), Sautrantikas (most famously in the &quot;Abhidharmakosha&quot;), and the Madhyamaka school ( Candrakirti&#x27;s &quot;Madhyamakavatara&quot;). The earliest source for the pudgala doctrinal controversy is the &quot;puggalakatha&quot; of the Kathavatthu, attributed to Moggaliputtatissa (c. third century BCE).

The Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu argued against the pudgala theory in his &quot;Abhidharmakosha.&quot; Vasubandhu begins by stating that the Vātsīputrīya hold that the pudgala &#x27;is based&#x27; on the five aggregates, and that this could mean one of two things:

# The five aggregates form an object, the pudgala. In this case, pudgala is just a nominal designation for the five aggregates, and not an independent object. 
# The pudgala is caused by the aggregates. In this case, pudgala also refers to just the aggregates and not to something else independent of them.

Vasubandhu argues then that &#x27;pudgala&#x27; is identical to the aggregates and just a label for them. Vasubandhu first argues that we can either perceive the pudgala directly or perceive it by perceiving the aggregates. If the latter, then its just a label for aggregates. If we perceive it directly, then the aggregates would be based on the pudgala, not the other way around. Vasubandhu also attacks the view that we can perceive the pudgala by all six senses. If this is true, then the pudgala is nothing but the five aggregates since all that the senses perceive is their direct sense impressions and nothing more.

=== Other doctrines ===
According to Thich Thien Chau, other secondary theses of the personalist Vātsīputrīya-Saṃmitīyas include:

# There exists an indestructible entity (&quot;avipranasa&quot;). This helps explain the mechanism for the retribution of actions. The indestructible entity continues to exist throughout the flux of existences, and is the essential base for the accumulation and maturation of karma.
# There are twelve knowledges on the path of seeing (darsanamarga) .
# There are four stages in the concentration of access: patience (ksanti), name (nama), notion (samjña) and the highest worldly dharma (laukikagradharma).
# Clear comprehension (abhisamaya) is gradual (anupurva) . 
# The five supernormal penetrations can be obtained by ordinary beings or heretics.
# Morality (Sila) designates (actions of) body and speech.
# Merit (punya) is accumulated continually, even during sleep. 
# It is impossible to say whether the characteristic of phenomena (dharmalabana) is permanence or impermanence. 
# There is an intermediate dhyana (dhyanantara) between the first and second dhyanas. 
# There is only one absolute asamskrta dharma: nirvana. 
# There are five, six or seven destinies (gati). 
# Knowledge (jñana) also can be called the path (marga). 
# An arahant is susceptible of falling from his attainment. 
# There is an intermediate state (antarabhava) in the sensuous realm (kamadhatu) and the form realm (rupadhatu), but not in the formless realm (arupadhatu)
# There are seventeen categories of celestial beings in the form realm

== Texts ==
The school had a Tripitaka, with Sutra Pitaka (in four Agamas), Vinaya Pitaka and Abhidharma Pitakas, like other early Buddhist schools. Only four of their texts survive in Chinese translation:

# The San fa tu lun, &quot;Traidharmakasastra&quot;, Taisho XXV, 1506.
# The Ssu a-han-mu ch&#x27;ao chieh, Taisho XXV, 1505. 
# The San-mi-ti pu lun, &quot;Sammatiyanikayasastra&quot;, Taisho XXXII. 1649. 
# The Lu erh-shih-erh ming-liao lun, &quot;Vinayadvavimsati-vidyasastra&quot;, Taisho XXIV. 1461.

One surviving Pudgalavada text is the &quot;Traidharmakasastra&quot; (Taisho no. 1506 pp. 15c-30a)&quot;,&quot; an Abhidharma work which was translated twice into Chinese. The text mentions that lack of knowledge also includes lack of knowledge of the indefinable (avaktavya), which refers to the pudgala. Another Pudgalavada text, the &quot;Sammatiyanikayasastra,&quot; put forth various arguments for and against the following propositions:

# There is no self
# Self neither exists nor does not exist
# Self exists
# Self is the same as the five aggregates
# Self is different than the five aggregates
# Self is eternal
# Self is not eternal

All of these views are ultimately rejected. The text claims that the pudgala is neither an existent nor a purely conceptual construct.

== Modern Scholarship ==
Peter Harvey agrees with criticisms leveled against the Pudgalavadins by Moggaliputta-Tissa and Vasubandhu, and finds that there is no support in the Pali Nikayas for their pudgala concept.

However, according to Bhiksu Thiện Châu:The creation of the theory of the pudgala represents a reaction against the &quot;depersonalization&quot; of the abhidharmika tradition. The Pudgalavadins, on the other hand, tried to preserve the essence of the doctrine of substancelessness (anatmavada). The theory of the pudgala has been misinterpreted by the polemical literature; nevertheless, it offers much of doctrinal interest to Buddhist thinkers.Furthermore, Thiện Châu in his analysis of their doctrine adds:The Pudgalavadins were probably not satisfied with the interpretation according to which a man is merely the result of a combination of psych~physical factors. For a man is something different from a chariot; the latter is only an assemblage of parts and separate pieces whereas the former is essentially a being with its totality of which the psycho-physical parts develop after conception and birth.According to Dan Lusthaus, &quot;no Buddhist school has been more vilified by its Buddhist peers or misunderstood by modern scholars&quot;. Lusthaus argues that, far from promoting the view of a self (&quot;atmavada&quot;), the Vātsīputrīya position which can be seen in their surviving texts is that the pudgala is &quot;a prajñapti (only a nominal existent) that is neither identical to nor different from the skandhas.&quot; Furthermore: The Vātsīputrīya argument is that the pudgala is a necessary prajñapti since any theory of karma, or any theory that posits that individuals can make spiritual progress for themselves or can assist other individuals to do likewise, is incoherent without it. Karma means that an action done at one time has subsequent consequences for the same individual at a later time, or even a later life. If the positive and negative consequences of an action don&#x27;t accrue to the self-same individual, then it would make no sense to speak of things like progress (who is progressing?), and Buddhist practice itself becomes incoherent. If there are no persons, then there is no one who suffers, no one who performs and reaps the consequences of his or her own karma, no Buddha, no Buddhists, and no Buddhism. Obviously, those are not acceptable consequences for a Buddhist.Lusthaus notes that for the Vātsīputrīyas, their theory is simply an attempt to explain what other Buddhist traditions leave unsaid and assumed, mainly what it is that undergoes rebirth, has moral responsibility and attains enlightenment. According to Lusthaus, for the Vātsīputrīyas, &quot;while other Buddhists might leave the word &quot;pudgala&quot; unsaid, the narratives presupposed in their doctrines require it.&quot;

== Saṃmitīya and other sub-schools ==

According to Thiện Châu, the Vātsīputrīyas were the initial parent school out of which branched off four sub-schools (sometime between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE); mainly the &quot;Saṃmitīyas,&quot; &quot;Dhammuttariyas, Bhadrayanikas,&quot; and the &quot;Sandagarikas&quot;. The Vātsīputrīya communities were established in Kosambi and Sarnath, living side by side with the &quot;Saṃmitīyas,&quot; a school which quickly eclipsed them in popularity.

The most prominent of the Pudgalavādin schools were certainly the &quot;Saṃmitīyas&quot; (Sanskrit; ) who were especially prominent in Sindh and in Gujarat during the Maitraka dynasty (470-788 CE). Inscriptions have also established the existence of Saṃmitīya communities in Mathura and Sarnath between the 2nd and 4th centuries CE. The Tibetan historian Buton Rinchen Drub noted that the Saṃmitīya used Apabhraṃśa as their main language. By the fourth century CE, this school had become so influential that they replaced the Sarvastivadins in Sarnath as the most prominent school. By the time of king Harsha in the seventh century, they were the largest Nikaya Buddhist school in India. Due to their geographic spread, this led to them being divided into two further sub-schools, the Avantakas centered in Avanti and the Kurukulas centered around Kuru on the upper Ganges.

Their most influential center of learning was at Valabhi University in Gujarat, which remained an important place for the study of Nikaya Buddhism until the 8th century CE. I-tsing, who visited Gujarat in 670 CE, noted that the Sammitiyas had the greatest number of followers in western India and that the learning center at Valabhi rivaled that of Nalanda.

Étienne Lamotte, using the writings of the Chinese traveler Xuanzang, asserted that the Saṃmitīya were in all likelihood the most populous non-Mahāyāna sect in India, comprising double the number of the next largest sect, although scholar L. S. Cousins revised his estimate down to a quarter of all non-Mahāyāna monks, still the largest overall. The Saṃmitīya sect seems to have been particularly strong in the Sindh, where one scholar estimates 350 Buddhist monasteries were Saṃmitīya of a total of 450. This area was rapidly Islamized in the wake of the Arab conquest. They continued to be a presence in India until the end of Indian Buddhism, but, never having gained a foothold elsewhere, did not continue thereafter.

Ancient sources such as Xuanzang and Tibetan historian Tāranātha reported that the Saṃmitīyas were staunch opponents of Mahāyāna. According to Tāranātha, Saṃmitīya monks from the Sindh burned tantric scriptures and destroyed a silver image of Hevajra at Vajrāsana monastery in Bodh Gaya. In the biography of Xuanzang, it is recounted that an elderly brahmin and follower of the Saṃmitīya sect named Prajñāgupta composed a treatise in 700 verses which opposed the Mahāyāna teachings. In response, while living at Nālandā, Xuanzang wrote a Sanskrit work in 1600 verses to refute this text, called &quot;The Destruction of Heresy&quot;.

<text>Shirley Ann Caesar-Williams, nee Caesar, (born October 13, 1938), known professionally as Shirley Caesar, is an American gospel singer. Her career began in 1951, when she signed to Federal Records at the age of 12. Throughout her seven decade career, Caesar has often been referred to as the &quot;First Lady of Gospel Music&quot;, and &quot;The Queen of Gospel Music&quot;. She has won eleven Grammy Awards, fifteen Dove Awards, and fourteen Stellar Awards.

Caesar has released over forty albums. She has participated in over 16 compilations and three gospel musicals, &quot;Mama I Want to Sing&quot;, &quot;Sing: Mama 2&quot; and &quot;Born to sing: Mama 3&quot;.

In 2009, she had sold 2.2 million albums since 1991, making her one of the top-selling gospel artists. She has made several notable appearances including the televised &quot;Live from Disney World Night of Joy&quot;, the &quot;Gospel According to VH1&quot;, and a White House performance for President George Bush. She gave a speech on the evolution of gospel music to the US Treasury Department. In 2017, Caesar was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from The Recording Academy. She has received the SESAC Lifetime Achievement Award, Rhapsody &amp; Rhythm Award from the National Museum of African American Music, and was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. In 2016, Caesar was honored with a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame, for her contributions in gospel music.

==Early life==
Caesar was born in Durham, North Carolina. She is the tenth of 13 children. All of her siblings are now deceased. Her father Jim Caesar was a well known local gospel singer. He died suddenly when Shirley was seven years old. Her mother Hallie Caesar was partially disabled due to a lame leg. Caesar had a special bond with her mother and took care of her until her death in 1989.

==Career==

Caesar first began singing and performing for family and friends. She began singing as Baby Shirley Caesar all over the Carolinas as invitations poured in. She could only perform on weekends due to being in school during the weekdays. Her professional music career began in 1958 at 19, when she approached Albertina Walker about joining The Caravans, one of the most popular gospel groups at that time. Albertina wanted the vocally talented young Caesar in her group after hearing her sing a solo. Caesar decided to halt her education to join the group.

Caesar recorded and performed with Albertina Walker, Cassietta George, Inez Andrews, Delores Washington, Josephine Howard, Eddie Williams, and James Herndon while in the Caravans. Her biggest hit with the Caravans was the song &quot;Sweeping Through the City&quot; followed by &quot;No Coward Soldier&quot;. After eight years with the Caravans, she decided to leave after being offered a solo recording contract with Hob Records. Her first LP on the Hob label was entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Go&quot;, backed up by the Institutional Radio Choir and includes the classics &quot;Oh Peter, Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot; and &quot;Choose Ye This Day&quot;. 

Other hits soon followed, with recordings such as &quot;Satan, We&#x27;re Gonna Tear Your Kingdom Down&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead, He&#x27;s Yet Alive&quot; and the classic &quot;Don&#x27;t Drive Your Mama Away&quot;. In 1971, she won her first Grammy Award for her recording of &quot;Put Your Hand in the Hand of the Man&quot;, and in 1975 her recording of the song &quot;No Charge&quot; became an instant hit and her first gold record. Although she had success she wanted to reach larger audiences and felt this wasn&#x27;t being achieved with Hob Records; she decided not to renew her record contract with them which ended that same year.

To reach more people with her music, Caesar signed with a secular record label called Roadshow Records in 1977 and released the debut album entitled &quot;First Lady&quot;. The producer of the album titled the album &quot;First Lady&quot; because Caesar was the first female to ever record on the label. The album contained songs with strong gospel lyrics, but many within the gospel community felt that the music itself was &quot;too worldly,&quot; and many gospel DJs refused to play it on their radio station. One song, however, &quot;Faded Rose&quot;, later became a Caesar classic. Overall, the album sold poorly, but the &quot;First Lady&quot; title caught on within the gospel industry, and concert announcers, DJs and gospel promoters everywhere started introducing her as &quot;The First Lady of Gospel Music&quot;, a title that has been associated with her ever since. 

The second and final album she recorded for Roadshow was &quot;From the Heart&quot; in 1978. It was poorly received for the same reason. Caesar searched for a gospel label and decided to sign with Word Records in 1980 and went on to win several more Grammy Awards during the next several years and beyond. She stayed with Word for many years and recorded some of the biggest hits of her career such as &quot;God&#x27;s Got It All in Control&quot;, &quot;Hold My Mule&quot; (which later went viral as a Thanksgiving-related Internet meme under the title &quot;You Name It&quot;), &quot;He&#x27;s Working It Out for You&quot;, &quot;Jesus, I Love Calling Your Name&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Next in Line for a Miracle&quot;.

She has made a name for herself on the gospel music circuit, making guest appearances on the Bobby Jones gospel show and other popular television shows. Caesar credits Albertina Walker as her mentor and &quot;Queen of Gospel Music&quot;.

Between 1981 and 1995, she received seven Dove Awards for Black Gospel Album of the Year for &quot;Live at the G.M.W.A.&quot;, &quot;Celebration&quot;, &quot;Christmasing&quot;, &quot;Sailin‘&quot;, &quot;Live ... In Chicago&quot;, &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Rejoice&quot;. She received two Black Gospel Song of the Year Awards for &quot;He&#x27;s Working It Out for You&quot; and &quot;Hold My Mule&quot;. She has performed with Patti LaBelle, Whitney Houston, Dorothy Norwood, Faith Evans, Dottie Peoples, Arnold Houston, Kim Burrell, John P. Kee, Kirk Franklin, Tonex, and Tye Tribbett, among others. 

Caesar is also an actress. She acted in movies, such as &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; (1998) with Larenz Tate and Little Richard, &quot;Fighting Temptations&quot; (2003) with Beyoncé and Cuba Gooding Jr., and &quot;The Unseen&quot; (2005) with Steve Harris. She acted in an episode of &quot;The Good News&quot; in 1998 as Aunt Shirley. Caesar appeared on &quot;The Parkers&quot; in 2004.

In 2014, her song &quot;Teach Me Master&quot;, which originally appeared on her 1972 album &quot;Get Up My Brother&quot;, was sampled by Dutch producer Bakermat as &quot;Teach Me&quot;. It reached number 22 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2016, she found herself back at the very top of the gospel &quot;Billboard&quot; chart with her CD release &quot;Fill This House&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Caesar is a recipient of a 1999 National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States&#x27; highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

She was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2000.

Caesar was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2010. She performed for President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama at the White House in 2015, along with Aretha Franklin.

In May 2016, the National Museum of African American Music honored Caesar with the Rhapsody &amp; Rhythm Award in Nashville in advance of the planned 2018 opening of the historic museum.

In June 2016, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce honored gospel singer Shirley Caesar with the 2,583rd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Education in later life==
After many years, Caesar finally accomplished her dream of completing her education. She had first enrolled at North Carolina State College in 1956 to study business education, but left two years later to pursue her music career. She returned to school and graduated with honors from Shaw University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration in 1984. She also spent time studying at the Divinity School of Duke University and has received honorary doctorates from Shaw University and Southeastern University.

==Personal life==
Caesar married Bishop Harold I. Williams in June 1983. The couple were co-pastors of the 1,500-member Mount Calvary Word of Faith Church in Raleigh, North Carolina until his death on July 4, 2014. While she does not have children of her own, she has two stepchildren from her husband, Harold Ivory Williams Jr. and Hope Ivy Mason.

Caesar is a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. She cites her mother as a strong influence in her decision to give so selflessly of herself. Caesar has committed a sizable portion of all concert sales to her outreach ministries. Recently, she has cut back on preaching and has appointed an executive pastor at her church, and he provides weekly sermons to the congregation while Caesar serves as senior pastor, but Caesar continues to record and perform in concert all over the country. 

She continues to hold her annual outreach ministries conference. The outreach ministry provides food, clothing, shelter, toys for children, and financial assistance to those in need. She opened an eponymous store and uses the profits to help others during the holiday season. 

When asked what would she still like to accomplish, she says: &quot;I would like to do more acting...&quot;

<text>The Sthavira nikāya (Sanskrit &quot;Sect of the Elders&quot;; ; ) was one of the early Buddhist schools. They split from the majority Mahāsāṃghikas at the time of the Second Buddhist council.

==Scholarly views==
===Origin===
The Sthavira nikāya was one of the early Buddhist schools. The Sthavira nikāya split away from the majority Mahāsāṃghikas during the Second Buddhist council resulting in the first schism in the Sangha.

The Mahāsāṃghika &quot;Śāriputraparipṛcchā&quot;, a text written to justify this school&#x27;s departure from the disciplinary code of the elder monks, asserts that the council was convened at Pāṭaliputra over matters of vinaya, and it is explained that the schism resulted from the majority (Mahāsaṃgha) refusing to accept the addition of rules to the Vinaya by the minority (Sthaviras). The Mahāsāṃghikas therefore saw the Sthaviras as being a breakaway group which was attempting to modify the original Vinaya.

Scholars have generally agreed that the matter of dispute was indeed a matter of vinaya, and have noted that the account of the Mahāsāṃghikas is bolstered by the vinaya texts themselves, as vinayas associated with the Sthaviras do contain more rules than those of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya. Modern scholarship therefore generally agrees that the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya is the oldest. According to Skilton, future scholars may determine that a study of the Mahāsāṃghika school will contribute to a better understanding of the early Dhamma-Vinaya than the Theravada school.

===Language===
The Tibetan historian Buton Rinchen Drub (1290–1364) wrote that the Mahāsāṃghikas used Prakrit, the Sarvāstivādins used Sanskrit, the Sthaviras used Paiśācī, and the Saṃmitīya used Apabhraṃśa.

===Legacy===
The Sthaviras later divided into other schools such as:

* Sarvāstivāda
* Vatsīputrīya
* Vibhajyavāda (Pali: &quot;Vibhajjavāda&quot;)

The Vibhajyavāda branch gave rise to a number of schools such as:

* Mahīśāsaka
* Dharmaguptaka
* Kāśyapīya
* Tāmraparnīya, later called &quot;Theravāda&quot;

==Relationship to Theravāda==

===Scholarly accounts===
The Theravāda school of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia has identified itself exclusively with the Sthaviras, as the Pali word &quot;thera&quot; is equivalent to the Sanskrit &quot;sthavira&quot;. This has led early Western historians to assume that the two parties are identical. However, this is not the case, and by the time of Ashoka, the Sthavira sect had split into the Sammitīya Pudgalavada, Sarvāstivāda, and the Vibhajyavāda schools.

The Vibhajyavāda school is believed to have split into other schools as well, such as the Mahīśāsaka school and the ancestor of the Theravada school. According to Damien Keown, there is no historical evidence that the Theravada school arose until around two centuries after the Great Schism which occurred at the Third Council.

===Theravādin accounts===
Starting with the &quot;Dīpavaṃsa&quot; chronicle in the 4th century, the Theravādins of the Mahāvihāra in Sri Lanka attempted to identify themselves with the original Sthavira sect. The Theravādin &quot;Dīpavaṃsa&quot; clarifies that the name &quot;Theravāda&quot; refers to the &quot;old&quot; teachings, making no indication that it refers to the Second Council. Similarly, the name &quot;Mahāsāṃghika&quot; is in reference to those who follow the original Vinaya of the undivided Saṃgha. The &quot;Dīpavaṃsa&quot; chronicle lauds the Theravāda as a &quot;great banyan&quot; and dismissively portrays the other early Buddhist schools as thorns (&quot;kaṇṭaka&quot;). &quot;Dīpavaṃsa&quot;, 4.90–91 says:
:These 17 sects are schismatic,
:only one is non-schismatic.
:With the non-schismatic sect,
:there are eighteen in all.
:Like a great banyan tree,
:the Theravāda is supreme,
:The Dispensation of the Conqueror,
:complete, without lack or excess.
:The other sects arose
:like thorns on the tree.
:— &quot;Dīpavaṃsa&quot;, 4.90–91

According to the &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot;, a Theravādin source, after the Second Council was closed those taking the side of junior monks did not accept the verdict but held an assembly of their own attended by ten thousand calling it a Mahasangiti (Great Convocation) from which the school derived its name Mahāsāṃghika. However, such popular explanations of &quot;Sthavira&quot; and &quot;Mahāsāṃghika&quot; are generally considered folk etymologies.

Bhante Sujato explains the relationship between the Sthavira sect and the Theravāda:

==Early life==
Miller was born in Los Angeles, California, to Beatrice (née Ammidown), a costume designer, publicist, and journalist, and Mark Miller, a television actor and producer. Her mother was the goddaughter of businessman Aristotle Onassis and an editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

Miller graduated from high school in Los Angeles and attended Menlo College in Atherton, California for two years from 1981 to 1983, then moved to New York City to study theatre at HB Studio.

==Career==
Her Broadway theatre break came in 1985 when she was cast in the lead (opposite Matthew Broderick) in the Neil Simon play &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot;. (She also starred with Broderick in the 1988 film version of that play).
She played a role in one episode (&quot;Death and the Lady&quot;) of the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (which aired on October 16, 1987), and accepted several other small roles in film and television work. She then returned to Broadway in a revival of &quot;Our Town&quot;; her portrayal of Emily garnered her a Tony Award nomination. She then appeared as Pee-wee Herman&#x27;s (Paul Reubens) fiancée, Winnie Johnston, in the 1988 release of &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot;. She played a supporting role in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Dead Bang&quot;, a cop thriller starring Don Johnson.

In 1990, she played Paula in &quot;Awakenings&quot;, starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. She also appeared in the 1990 movies &quot;Downtown&quot;, with Anthony Edwards and Forest Whitaker, and &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;, alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing a teacher, hiding with her son Dominic from her criminal drug-dealing husband Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson).
She subsequently appeared in a number of other theatrical movies, notably as Edna Purviance in &quot;Chaplin&quot; and with Tim Daly as Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Harwood in Peter Yates&#x27; film &quot;Year of the Comet&quot;, both in 1992, and the following year she appeared as the love interest of Al Pacino&#x27;s character in &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;.

Her 2005 film &quot;Funny Money&quot; was voted the top film of the Sarasota Film Festival. She appeared in the Fox series &quot;Vanished&quot; for six episodes, playing the ex-wife of a U.S. senator whose wife has mysteriously disappeared. In 2007, she appeared in the comedy &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot; co-starring Jessica Simpson and Luke Wilson. She guest starred as Fran on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. Miller appeared in the horror film &quot;The Messengers&quot;, co-starring Dylan McDermott and Kristen Stewart. The film was produced by director Sam Raimi&#x27;s production company, Ghost House Pictures. In 2011, she portrayed Doris, the wife of protagonist George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;The Artist&quot;.

After a recurring role on the ABC soap opera &quot;Mistresses&quot;, Miller was cast in 2015 as a regular in the first season of ABC&#x27;s drama series &quot;American Crime&quot;.

In October 2020, Miller was cast as First Lady Nancy Reagan in &quot;Reagan&quot;, a biographical film based on the life of President Ronald Reagan. &quot;Reagan&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on August 30, 2024.

<doc id="576587" wikidata="Q83978" url="?curid=576587" title="Danny Phantom">
<text>Danny Phantom is an American animated paranormal superhero action adventure television series created by Butch Hartman for Nickelodeon. The series premiered on April 3, 2004, immediately after the 2004 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, and ended on August 24, 2007. The series follows Danny Fenton, a teenage boy who, after an accident with an unpredictable portal between the human world and the &quot;Ghost Zone&quot;, becomes a human-ghost hybrid and takes on the task of saving his town (and the world) from subsequent ghost attacks using an evolving variety of supernatural powers. Danny is aided in his quest by his two best friends, Sam Manson and Tucker Foley, and later by his older sister Jazz, who for most of the series&#x27; run are among the only people who know of his double life.

Throughout its run, &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; received five Annie Award nominations and positive reviews. In recent years, the series, particularly its first two seasons, has received renewed attention and critical acclaim from critics and audiences, being considered by many as Hartman&#x27;s best work. Additionally, &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; has spawned video games, home video releases, toys, and various other merchandise. A campaign to revive &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; called the Go Ghost Again Movement has spawned in recent years, including a petition on Change.org that has received thousands of signatures.

==Premise==

Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Fenton, a 14-year-old boy living in the small town of Amity Park, lives with his ghost hunting eccentric parents, Jack and Madeline &quot;Maddie&quot;, and his overprotective but caring 16-year-old sister, Jasmine &quot;Jazz&quot;. Upon pressure from his two best friends, Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Manson and Tucker Foley, Danny decides to explore the Ghost Portal created by his parents in their attempt to bridge the human world and the Ghost Zone (the parallel universe in which ghosts reside), that when plugged in, failed to work. Once inside, he inadvertently presses the &quot;On&quot; button (which his parents naively failed to do), thus activating the Portal and infusing his DNA with ectoplasm, transforming him into a half-ghost.

Danny, who calls himself &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; in ghost form, develops the ability to fly, become invisible, intangible, and &quot;overshadow&quot; (possess and control) people after first learning how to switch back and forth at will between his ghost and human forms. Over time, he develops much stronger abilities, such as his Ghost Ray (a concentrated blast of energy he fires from his hand), his Ghostly Wail (an intensely powerful scream with sonic capabilities that knocks back anything caught in its path), and even cryokinesis. Danny is initially frightened by his new abilities and has little control over them, but he soon learns to use them to protect his town from evil spirits. Danny turns to the life of a superhero, using his powers to rid his hometown of the various ghosts and mutant animals which begin to plague it and are almost always brought into the world thanks to the sporadic activation of the Fentons&#x27; Ghost Portal. Sam, Tucker, and Jazz are Danny&#x27;s primary allies in his ghost-fighting activities, and help him keep his ghost-half a secret.

Danny&#x27;s ghost form is a polarization of what he looked like when he first entered the Ghost Portal. When he &quot;goes ghost&quot;, his jet-black hair turns snow-white, his sky blue eyes turn neon green, and the black-and-white jumpsuit he had put on before the accident appears in negative color, with the originally white areas of the suit appearing black, and vice versa. In the premiere episode of season two, a ghost grants Sam&#x27;s inadvertent wish that she and Danny had never met; in consequence, Danny loses not only memories but his ghost powers as well, as Sam had primarily been the one to persuade Danny to investigate the portal in the first place, which led to the accident. Luckily, however, Sam had been protected from the wish by the ghost-hunting technology of Danny&#x27;s parents, allowing her to persuade the now fully human Danny to regain his powers by re-enacting the accident. This time, before Danny enters the portal, Sam replaces the logo of his father&#x27;s face on the jumpsuit, which she also had removed the first time (if she hadn&#x27;t, it would have been part of Danny&#x27;s ghost form), with her recently designed &quot;DP&quot; fused-letter logo on the chest so that it appears when he goes ghost from then on.

Danny faces threats of many kinds, including vengeful ghost hunter Valerie Gray (voiced by Cree Summer) who, for a short period of time, becomes his love interest, an enemy half-ghost Vlad Masters, an old college friend of his father&#x27;s and considered to be Danny&#x27;s true arch-rival, and even his own parents who, as ghost hunters, view Danny Phantom (as they would and do to any ghosts) as nothing but a menace to human society. Furthermore, Danny tries to keep his secret safe from his classmates, teachers, and family. Throughout the progression of the series, Danny slowly realizes his own potential and purpose, while both worlds slowly begin to accept him as their defender.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Danny Phantom&quot; was very well received by both television critics and audiences, gathering a cult following since its original run. Sean Aitchison from CBR said &quot;&quot;Danny Phantom&quot; might have a few elements that firmly place it in the 2000s, but the storytelling and design still feel fresh and fun in modern day. The show was full of action and humor, and the characters felt real and layered. If you&#x27;re looking for an old Nickelodeon cartoon to rewatch, &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; should be on your list.&quot; Eric McInnis writing for Study Breaks Magazine said, &quot;The show offered fun comedy, memorable characters, and fantastic character designs for the enemies Danny had to fight in each episode.&quot;

<text>Nilo Rixio Soruco Arancibia (6 July 1927, Tarija, Bolivia – 31 March 2004, Tarija, Bolivia) was a Bolivian singer-songwriter.

Soruco wrote more than 300 songs. A communist, he was banned under the Bolivian leadership of the 1970s. Soruco was in exile in Caracas, Venezuela until 1978.

Among his tunes are &quot;La vida es linda&quot;, &quot;Ya la pagarán&quot;, &quot;Duraznero&quot;, &quot;Instantánea&quot;, and particularly &quot;Caraqueña&quot;, composed in his Venezuelan exile, which are sung at Bolivia&#x27;s popular celebrations.

Soruco won Bolivia&#x27;s National Culture Prize in 2003.

<text>The 2003–04 NHL season was the 87th regular season of the National Hockey League. The Stanley Cup champions were the Tampa Bay Lightning, who won the best of seven series four games to three against the Calgary Flames.

For the fourth time in eight years, the all-time record for total shutouts in a season was shattered, as 192 shutouts were recorded. The 2003–04 regular season was also the first one (excluding the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season) since 1967–68 in which there was neither a 50-goal scorer, nor a 100-point scorer. It was also the final NHL season before the 2004–05 NHL lockout with games resuming in the fall of 2005 as part of the 2005–06 season, and the final season in which games could end in ties.

==League business==
===Collective bargaining agreement===
The existing NHL collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and the players was set to expire in September 2004. During the entire 2003–04 season, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and NHL Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) head Bob Goodenow waged a war of words with no CBA being signed. The dispute eventually led to the 2004–05 NHL lockout and the cancellation of the 2004–05 season.

===New scheduling formula===
The schedule of 82 games was revamped. The new format increased divisional games from five to six per team (24 total), and decreased inter-conference games to at least one per team, with three extra games (18 in total).

===Entry draft===
The 2003 NHL Entry Draft was held on June 21–22, 2003 at the Gaylord Entertainment Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Marc-Andre Fleury was selected first overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins.

===Preseason games in Europe===
As part of the NHL Challenge, the Toronto Maple Leafs played a three-preseason-game series in Europe against Finnish team Jokerit Helsinki and the Swedish teams Djurgården Stockholm and Färjestad Karlstad.

==Uniform changes==
The alternating of jerseys was changed. For the first season since the 1969–70 season, teams would now wear their colored jerseys at home and white jerseys away.

==Arena changes==
* The Edmonton Oilers&#x27; home arena, Skyreach Centre, was renamed Rexall Place as part of a new naming rights agreement with Rexall that was signed on November 20, 2003. 
* The Philadelphia Flyers&#x27;s home arena, the First Union Center, was renamed the Wachovia Center after First Union merged with Wachovia.
* The Phoenix Coyotes moved from America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona to Glendale Arena in Glendale, Arizona on December 27, 2003.

==Regular season==
===First regular season outdoor game===
The Heritage Classic, the first NHL regular season game to be played outdoors, was held on November 22, 2003, at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Alberta. The Montreal Canadiens defeated the Edmonton Oilers, 4–3.

===All-Star Game===
The All-Star Game was played on February 8, 2004, at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the home of the Minnesota Wild.

===Highlights===
On September 26, just before the season was to begin, young Atlanta Thrashers star Dany Heatley crashed his Ferrari in suburban Atlanta. The passenger, Thrashers teammate Dan Snyder, was killed. Heatley himself was badly injured and eventually charged with vehicular homicide.

Entering the season, the two Stanley Cup favorites were the Ottawa Senators in the Eastern Conference, who had won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy and come within a win of the Stanley Cup Finals the year before, and the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference, who, despite losing legendary goaltender Patrick Roy to retirement, added both Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya to an already star-studded lineup. Neither of these teams, however, were as successful as expected, with Ottawa finishing fifth in their conference and Colorado finishing fourth, losing the Northwest Division title for the first time in a decade when the franchise was still known as the Quebec Nordiques.

The greatest disappointments were the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, who, despite making it to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals the year prior and adding both Sergei Fedorov and Vaclav Prospal, failed to make the playoffs. The Los Angeles Kings failed to make the playoffs in large part due to a season-ending 11-game losing streak. In the East, the star-studded New York Rangers again failed to make the playoffs. The Washington Capitals, who were regarded as a contender, also stumbled early in the season and never recovered. The end of the season saw two of the most extensive housecleanings in League history, as the Rangers and Capitals traded away many of their stars and entered &quot;rebuilding mode.&quot; The Capitals traded away Jaromir Jagr, Peter Bondra, Sergei Gonchar, Robert Lang and Anson Carter, while the Rangers moved Petr Nedved, Brian Leetch, Anson Carter and Alexei Kovalev to other NHL teams.

The most surprising teams were the Tampa Bay Lightning in the East and the San Jose Sharks in the West. The Lightning, who had a remarkable season with only 20 man-games lost to injury, finished atop the Eastern Conference, while the Sharks, who were firmly in rebuilding mode after a disastrous 28–37–9–8 campaign the last season, came second in the West and won the Pacific Division.

Two other teams that did better than expected were carried by surprising young goaltenders. The Calgary Flames ended a seven-year playoff drought backed by the solid play of Miikka Kiprusoff, and the Boston Bruins won the Northeast Division by a whisker over the Toronto Maple Leafs with the help of eventual Calder Memorial Trophy-winning goaltender Andrew Raycroft.

Goaltending was also the story of the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Detroit Red Wings as the return from retirement of legend Dominik Hasek bumped Curtis Joseph to the minor leagues. At the same time, long-time back up Manny Legace recorded better numbers than both veterans and won the starting job in the playoffs.

Of note is the fact that the Nashville Predators made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, though they were dispatched by a star-studded Detroit Red Wings team in the first round.

The regular season ended controversially, when in March 2004, the Vancouver Canucks&#x27; Todd Bertuzzi infamously attacked and severely injured the Colorado Avalanche&#x27;s Steve Moore, forcing the latter eventually to retire.

===Final standings===
&quot;Detroit Red Wings won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy and home-ice advantage throughout the playoffs.&quot;

For rankings in conference, division leaders are automatically ranked 1–3. These three, plus the next five teams in the conference standings, earn playoff berths at the end of the season.

====Eastern Conference====

====Western Conference====

==Playoffs==

===Bracket===
In each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team played at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top eight teams in each conference made the playoffs, with the three division winners seeded 1–3 based on regular season record, and the five remaining teams seeded 4–8.

The NHL used &quot;re-seeding&quot; instead of a fixed bracket playoff system. During the first three rounds, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed, the second-highest remaining seed played the second-lowest remaining seed, and so forth. The higher-seeded team was awarded home ice advantage. The two conference winners then advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where home ice advantage was awarded to the team that had the better regular season record.

==Awards==
The NHL Awards presentation took place in Toronto.

==Broadcasting==
===Canada===
This was the second season of the league&#x27;s Canadian national broadcast rights deals with CBC and TSN. CBC continued to air Saturday night &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; regular season games, while TSN&#x27;s coverage included &quot;Wednesday Night Hockey&quot; and other selected weeknights. During the first three rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, TSN televised all-U.S. games while CBC aired all games involving Canadian teams. CBC then had exclusive coverage of the Stanley Cup Finals.

===United States===
This was the fifth and final year of the league&#x27;s U.S. national broadcast rights deal with ESPN and ABC. ESPN and ESPN2 aired weeknight games throughout the regular season. ABC&#x27;s coverage included the All-Star Game and five weeks worth of regional games on Saturday afternoons between January and March. During the first two rounds of the playoffs, ESPN and ESPN2 aired selected games, while ABC had Saturday regional telecasts. Each U.S. team&#x27;s regional broadcaster produced local coverage of first and second-round games (except for those games on ABC). ABC&#x27;s weekend telecasts continued into the Conference Finals, while ESPN had the rest of the third-round games. ESPN then aired the first two games of the Stanley Cup Finals before the rest of the series shifted to ABC.

In May 2004, NBC reached an agreement to broadcast a slate of regular season games and playoff games. ESPN was only willing to renew its contract for two additional years, without games on ABC, with an opt-out clause after the first year.

<text>Turkish literature () comprises oral compositions and written texts in the Turkish language. The Ottoman form of Turkish, which forms the basis of much of the written corpus, was highly influenced by Persian and Arabic literature, and used the Ottoman Turkish alphabet.

The history of the broader Turkic literature spans a period of nearly 1,300 years. The oldest extant records of written Turkic are the Orhon inscriptions, found in the Orhon River valley in central Mongolia and dating to the 7th century. Subsequent to this period, between the 9th and 11th centuries, there arose among the nomadic Turkic peoples of Central Asia a tradition of oral epics, such as the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot; of the Oghuz Turks— ancestors of the modern Turkish people—and the &quot;Epic of Manas&quot; of the Kyrgyz people.

Beginning with the victory of the Seljuks at the Battle of Manzikert in the late 11th century, the Oghuz Turks began to settle in Anatolia, and in addition to the earlier oral traditions there arose a written literary tradition issuing largely—in terms of themes, genres, and styles—from Arabic and Persian literature. For the next 900 years, until shortly before the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, the oral and written traditions would remain largely separate from one another. With the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the two traditions came together for the first time.

==History==
The earliest known examples of Turkic poetry date to sometime in the 6th century AD and were composed in the Uyghur language. Some of the earliest verses attributed to Uyghur Turkic writers are only available in Chinese language translations. During the era of oral poetry, the earliest Turkic verses were intended as songs and their recitation a part of the community&#x27;s social life and entertainment. For example, in the shamanistic and animistic culture of the pre-Islamic Turkic peoples verses of poetry were performed at religious gatherings in ceremonies before a hunt (&quot;sığır&quot;), at communal feasts following a hunt (&quot;şölen&quot;). Poetry was also sung at solemn times and elegy called &quot;sagu&quot; were recited at &quot;yuğ&quot; funerals and other commemorations of the dead.

Of the long epics, only the Oğuzname has survived in its entirety. The Book of Dede Korkut may have had its origins in the poetry of the 10th century but remained an oral tradition until the 15th century. The earlier written works Kutadgu Bilig and Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk date to the second half of the 11th century and are the earliest known examples of Turkish literature with few exceptions.

One of the most important figures of early Turkish literature was the 13th century Sufi poet Yunus Emre. The golden age of Ottoman literature lasted from the 15th century until the 18th century and included mostly divan poetry but also some prose works, most notably the 10-volume Seyahatnâme (Book of Travels) written by Evliya Çelebi.

==Periodization==
The periodization of Turkic literature is debated and scholars have floated different proposals to classify the stages of Turkic literary development. One proposal divides Turkic literature into early literature (8th to 19th c.) and modern (19th to 21st c.). Other systems of classification have divided the literature into three periods either pre-Islamic/Islamic/modern or pre-Ottoman/Ottoman/modern. Yet another more complex approach suggests a 5-stage division including both pre-Islamic (until the 11th century) and pre-Ottoman Islamic (between the 11th and 13th centuries). The 5-stage approach further divides modern literature into a transitional period from the 1850s to the 1920s and finally a modern period reaching into the present day.

==The two traditions of Turkish literature==

Throughout most of its history, Turkish literature has been rather sharply divided into two different traditions, neither of which exercised much influence upon the other until the 19th century. The first of these two traditions is Turkish folk literature, and the second is Turkish written literature.

For most of the history of Turkish literature, the salient difference between the folk and the written traditions has been the variety of language employed. The folk tradition, by and large, was an oral tradition carried on by minstrels and remained free of the influence of Persian and Arabic literature, and consequently of those literatures&#x27; respective languages. In folk poetry—which is by far the tradition&#x27;s dominant genre—this basic fact led to two major consequences in terms of poetic style:
* folk poetry made use of syllabic verse, as opposed to the qualitative verse employed in the written poetic tradition
* the basic structural unit of folk poetry became the quatrain (Turkish: &quot;dörtlük&quot;) rather than the couplets (Turkish: &quot;beyit&quot;) more commonly employed in written poetry

Furthermore, Turkish folk poetry has always had an intimate connection with song—most of the poetry was, in fact, expressly composed so as to be sung—and so became to a great extent inseparable from the tradition of Turkish folk music.

In contrast to the tradition of Turkish folk literature, Turkish written literature—prior to the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923—tended to embrace the influence of Persian and Arabic literature. To some extent, this can be seen as far back as the Seljuk period in the late 11th to early 14th centuries, where official business was conducted in the Persian language, rather than in Turkish, and where a court poet such as Dehhanî—who served under the 13th century sultan Ala ad-Din Kay Qubadh I—wrote in a language highly inflected with Persian.

When the Ottoman Empire arose early in the 14th century, in northwestern Anatolia, it continued this tradition. The standard poetic forms—for poetry was as much the dominant genre in the written tradition as in the folk tradition—were derived either directly from the Persian literary tradition (the &quot;gazel&quot; غزل; the &quot;mesnevî&quot; مثنوی), or indirectly through Persian from the Arabic (the &quot;kasîde&quot; قصيده). However, the decision to adopt these poetic forms wholesale led to two important further consequences:
* the poetic meters (Turkish: &quot;aruz&quot;) of Persian poetry were adopted;
* Persian- and Arabic-based words were brought into the Turkish language in great numbers, as Turkish words rarely worked well within the system of Persian poetic meter.

Out of this confluence of choices, the Ottoman Turkish language—which was always highly distinct from spoken Turkish—was effectively born. This style of writing under Persian and Arabic influence came to be known as &quot;Divan literature&quot; (Turkish: &quot;divan edebiyatı&quot;), &quot;dîvân&quot; (ديوان) being the Ottoman Turkish word referring to the collected works of a poet.

Just as Turkish folk poetry was intimately bound up with Turkish folk music, so did Ottoman Divan poetry develop a strong connection with Turkish classical music, with the poems of the Divan poets often being taken up to serve as song lyrics.

==Folk literature==

Turkish folk literature is an oral tradition deeply rooted, in its form, in Central Asian nomadic traditions. However, in its themes, Turkish folk literature reflects the problems peculiar to a settled (or settling) people who have abandoned the nomadic lifestyle. One example of this is the series of folktales surrounding the figure of Keloğlan, a young boy beset with the difficulties of finding a wife, helping his mother to keep the family house intact, and dealing with the problems caused by his neighbors. Another example is the rather mysterious figure of Nasreddin, a trickster who often plays jokes, of a sort, on his neighbors.

Nasreddin also reflects another significant change that had occurred between the days when the Turkish people were nomadic and the days when they had largely become settled in Anatolia; namely, Nasreddin is a Muslim Imam. The Turkic peoples had first become Islamized sometime around the 9th or 10th century, as is evidenced from the clear Islamic influence on the 11th century Karakhanid work the &quot;Kutadgu Bilig&quot; (&quot;Wisdom of Royal Glory&quot;), written by Yusuf Has Hajib. The religion henceforth came to exercise an enormous influence on Turkish society and literature, particularly the heavily mystically oriented Sufi and Shi&#x27;a varieties of Islam. The Sufi influence, for instance, can be seen clearly not only in the tales concerning Nasreddin but also in the works of Yunus Emre, a towering figure in Turkish literature and a poet who lived at the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century, probably in the Karamanid state in south-central Anatolia. The Shi&#x27;a influence, on the other hand, can be seen extensively in the tradition of the &quot;aşık&quot;s, or &quot;ozan&quot;s, who are roughly akin to medieval European minstrels and who traditionally have had a strong connection with the Alevi faith, which can be seen as something of a homegrown Turkish variety of Shi&#x27;a Islam. It is, however, important to note that in Turkish culture, such a neat division into Sufi and Shi&#x27;a is scarcely possible: for instance, Yunus Emre is considered by some to have been an Alevi, while the entire Turkish &quot;aşık&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition is permeated with the thought of the Bektashi Sufi order, which is itself a blending of Shi&#x27;a and Sufi concepts. The word &quot;aşık&quot; (literally, &quot;lover&quot;) is in fact the term used for first-level members of the Bektashi order.

Because the Turkish folk literature tradition extends in a more or less unbroken line from about the 10th or 11th century to today, it is perhaps best to consider the tradition from the perspective of genre. There are three basic genres in the tradition: epic; folk poetry; and folklore.

===The epic tradition===
The Turkish epic has its roots in the Central Asian epic tradition that gave rise to the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;; written in the Azerbaijani language – and recognizably similar to modern Istanbul Turkish – the form developed from the oral traditions of the Oghuz Turks (a branch of the Turkic peoples which migrated towards western Asia and eastern Europe through Transoxiana, beginning in the 9th century). The &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot; endured in the oral tradition of the Oghuz Turks after settling in Anatolia. Alpamysh is an earlier epic, still preserved in the literature of various Turkic peoples of Central Asia in addition to its important place in the Anatolian tradition.

The &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot; was the primary element of the Azerbaijani–Turkish epic tradition in the Caucasus and Anatolia for several centuries. Concurrent to the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot; was the so-called &quot;Epic of Köroğlu&quot;, which concerns the adventures of Rüşen Ali (&quot;Köroğlu&quot;, or &quot;son of the blind man&quot;) as he exacted revenge for the blinding of his father. The origins of this epic are somewhat more mysterious than those of the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;: many believe it to have arisen in Anatolia sometime between the 15th and 17th centuries; more reliable testimony, though, seems to indicate that the story is nearly as old as that of the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;, dating from around the dawn of the 11th century. Complicating matters somewhat is the fact that Köroğlu is also the name of a poet of the &quot;aşık&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition.

The epic tradition in modern Turkish literature may be seen in the &quot;Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin&quot; (&quot;Şeyh Bedreddin Destanı&quot;), published in 1936 by the poet Nâzım Hikmet Ran (1901–1963). This long poem – which concerns an Anatolian shaykh&#x27;s rebellion against the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed I — is a modern epic, yet draws upon the same independent-minded traditions of the Anatolian people as depicted in the &quot;Epic of Köroğlu&quot;. Many of the works of the 20th-century novelist Yaşar Kemal (1923–2015 ), such as the 1955 novel &quot;Memed, My Hawk&quot; (&quot;İnce Memed&quot;), can be considered modern prose epics continuing this long tradition.

===Folk poetry===

The folk poetry tradition in Turkish literature, as indicated above, was strongly influenced by the Islamic Sufi and Shi&#x27;a traditions. Furthermore, as partly evidenced by the prevalence of the still existent &quot;aşık&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition, the dominant element in Turkish folk poetry has always been song. The development of folk poetry in Turkish—which began to emerge in the 13th century with such important writers as Yunus Emre, Sultan Veled, and Şeyyâd Hamza—was given a great boost when, on 13 May 1277, Karamanoğlu Mehmet Bey declared Turkish the official state language of Anatolia&#x27;s powerful Karamanid state; subsequently, many of the tradition&#x27;s greatest poets would continue to emerge from this region.

There are, broadly speaking, two traditions (or schools) of Turkish folk poetry:
* the &quot;aşık&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition, which—although much influenced by religion, as mentioned above—was for the most part a secular tradition;
* the explicitly religious tradition, which emerged from the gathering places (&quot;tekke&quot;s) of the Sufi religious orders and Shi&#x27;a groups.

Much of the poetry and song of the &quot;aşık&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition, being almost exclusively oral until the 19th century, remains anonymous. There are, however, a few well-known &quot;aşık&quot;s from before that time whose names have survived together with their works: the aforementioned Köroğlu (16th century); Karacaoğlan (1606?–1689?), who may be the best-known of the pre-19th century &quot;aşık&quot;s; Dadaloğlu (1785?–1868?), who was one of the last of the great &quot;aşık&quot;s before the tradition began to dwindle somewhat in the late 19th century; and several others. The &quot;aşık&quot;s were essentially minstrels who travelled through Anatolia performing their songs on the &quot;bağlama&quot;, a mandolin-like instrument whose paired strings are considered to have a symbolic religious significance in Alevi/Bektashi culture. Despite the decline of the &quot;aşık&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition in the 19th century, it experienced a significant revival in the 20th century thanks to such outstanding figures as Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu (1894–1973), Aşık Mahzuni Şerif (1938–2002), Neşet Ertaş (1938–2012), and many others.
The explicitly religious folk tradition of &quot;tekke&quot; literature shared a similar basis with the &quot;aşık&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition in that the poems were generally intended to be sung, generally in religious gatherings, making them somewhat akin to Western hymns (Turkish &quot;ilahi&quot;). One major difference from the &quot;aşık&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition, however, is that—from the very beginning—the poems of the &quot;tekke&quot; tradition were written down. This was because they were produced by revered religious figures in the literate environment of the &quot;tekke&quot;, as opposed to the milieu of the &quot;aşık&quot;/&quot;ozan&quot; tradition, where the majority could not read or write. The major figures in the tradition of &quot;tekke&quot; literature are: Yunus Emre (1240?–1320?), who is one of the most important figures in all of Turkish literature; Süleyman Çelebi (?–1422), who wrote a highly popular long poem called &quot;Vesîletü&#x27;n-Necât&quot; (وسيلة النجاة &quot;The Means of Salvation&quot;, but more commonly known as the &quot;Mevlid&quot;), concerning the birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad; Kaygusuz Abdal (1397–?), who is widely considered the founder of Alevi/Bektashi literature; and Pir Sultan Abdal (?–1560), whom many consider to be the pinnacle of that literature.

===Folklore===
==Ottoman literature==
The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and prose. Of the two, poetry—specifically, Divan poetry—was by far the dominant stream. Moreover, until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction; that is, there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European romance, short story, or novel (though analogous genres did, to some extent, exist in both the Turkish folk tradition and in Divan poetry).

===Divan poetry===

Ottoman Divan poetry was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير &quot;mura&#x27;ât-i nazîr&quot; / تناسب
&quot;tenâsüb&quot;) and opposition (تضاد &quot;tezâd&quot;)—were more or less prescribed. Examples of prevalent symbols that, to some extent, oppose one another include, among others:
* the nightingale (بلبل &quot;bülbül&quot;)—the rose (ﮔل &quot;gül&quot;)
* the world (جهان &quot;cihan&quot;; عالم &quot;‘âlem&quot;)—the rosegarden (ﮔﻠﺴﺘﺎن &quot;gülistan&quot;; ﮔﻠﺸﻦ &quot;gülşen&quot;)
* the ascetic (زاهد &quot;zâhid&quot;)—the dervish (درويش &quot;derviş&quot;)

As the opposition of &quot;the ascetic&quot; and &quot;the dervish&quot; suggests, Divan poetry—much like Turkish folk poetry—was heavily influenced by Sufi thought. One of the primary characteristics of Divan poetry, however—as of the Persian poetry before it—was its mingling of the mystical Sufi element with a profane and even erotic element. Thus, the pairing of &quot;the nightingale&quot; and &quot;the rose&quot; simultaneously suggests two different relationships:
* the relationship between the fervent lover (&quot;the nightingale&quot;) and the inconstant beloved (&quot;the rose&quot;)
* the relationship between the individual Sufi practitioner (who is often characterized in Sufism as a lover) and God (who is considered the ultimate source and object of love)

Similarly, &quot;the world&quot; refers simultaneously to the physical world and to this physical world considered as the abode of sorrow and impermanence, while &quot;the rosegarden&quot; refers simultaneously to a literal garden and to the garden of Paradise. &quot;The nightingale&quot;, or suffering lover, is often seen as situated—both literally and figuratively—in &quot;the world&quot;, while &quot;the rose&quot;, or beloved, is seen as being in &quot;the rosegarden&quot;.

Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. A brief example is the following line of verse, or &quot;mısra&quot; (مصراع), by the 18th-century judge and poet Hayatî Efendi:

:بر گل مى وار بو گلشن ﻋالمدﻪ خارسز
:&quot;Bir gül mü var bu gülşen-i ‘âlemde hârsız&quot;
:(&quot;Does any rose, in this rosegarden world, lack thorns?&quot;)

Here, the nightingale is only implied (as being the poet/lover), while the rose, or beloved, is shown to be capable of inflicting pain with its thorns (خار &quot;hâr&quot;). The world, as a result, is seen as having both positive aspects (it is a rosegarden, and thus analogous to the garden of Paradise) and negative aspects (it is a rosegarden full of thorns, and thus different from the garden of Paradise).

As for the development of Divan poetry over the more than 500 years of its existence, that is—as the Ottomanist Walter G. Andrews points out—a study still in its infancy; clearly defined movements and periods have not yet been decided upon. Early in the history of the tradition, the Persian influence was very strong, but this was mitigated somewhat through the influence of poets such as the Azerbaijani Nesîmî (?–1417?) and the Uzbek Ali Şîr Nevâî (1441–1501), both of whom offered strong arguments for the poetic status of the Turkic languages as against the much-venerated Persian. Partly as a result of such arguments, Divan poetry in its strongest period—from the 16th to the 18th centuries—came to display a unique balance of Persian and Turkish elements.

Although Turkish poets (Ottoman and Chagatay) had been inspired and influenced by classical Persian poetry, it would be a superficial judgment to consider the former as blind imitators of the latter, as is often done. A limited vocabulary and common technique, and the same world of imagery and subject matter based mainly on Islamic sources, were shared by all poets of Islamic literature.

Despite the lack of certainty regarding the stylistic movements and periods of Divan poetry, however, certain highly different styles are clear enough, and can perhaps be seen as exemplified by certain poets:

* Fuzûlî (1483?–1556); a unique poet who wrote with equal skill in Azerbaijani, Persian, and Arabic, and who came to be as influential in Persian as in Divan poetry
* Hayâlî (1500?–1557); a poet that lived in the Divan tradition
* Bâkî (1526–1600); a poet of great rhetorical power and linguistic subtlety whose skill in using the pre-established tropes of the Divan tradition is quite representative of the poetry in the time of Süleyman the Magnificent
* Nef‘î (1570?–1635); a poet considered the master of the &quot;kasîde&quot; (a kind of panegyric), as well as being known for his harshly satirical poems, which led to his execution
* Nâbî (1642–1712); a poet who wrote a number of socially oriented poems critical of the stagnation period of Ottoman history
* Nedîm (1681?–1730); a revolutionary poet of the Tulip Era of Ottoman history, who infused the rather élite and abstruse language of Divan poetry with numerous simpler, populist elements
* Şeyh Gâlib (1757–1799); a poet of the Mevlevî Sufi order whose work is considered the culmination of the highly complex so-called &quot;Indian style&quot; (سبك هندى &quot;sebk-i hindî&quot;)

The vast majority of Divan poetry was lyric in nature: either &quot;gazel&quot;s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or &quot;kasîde&quot;s. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the &quot;mesnevî&quot;, a kind of verse romance and thus a variety of narrative poetry; the two most notable examples of this form are the &quot;Leylî vü Mecnun&quot; (ليلى و مجنون) of Fuzûlî and the &quot;Hüsn ü Aşk&quot; (حسن و عشق; &quot;Beauty and Love&quot;) of Şeyh Gâlib.

===Early Ottoman prose===

Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of &quot;sec&quot;&#x27; (سجع, also transliterated as &quot;seci&quot;), or rhymed prose, a type of writing descended from the Arabic &quot;saj&#x27;&quot; and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a rhyme.

Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time. This tradition was exclusively nonfictional in nature—the fiction tradition was limited to narrative poetry. A number of such nonfictional prose genres developed:
* the &quot;târih&quot; (تاريخ), or history, a tradition in which there are many notable writers, including the 15th-century historian Aşıkpaşazâde and the 17th-century historians Kâtib Çelebi and Naîmâ
* the &quot;seyâhatnâme&quot; (سياحت نامه), or travelogue, of which the outstanding example is the 17th-century &quot;Seyahâtnâme&quot; of Evliya Çelebi
* the &quot;sefâretnâme&quot; (سفارت نامه), a related genre specific to the journeys and experiences of an Ottoman ambassador, and which is best exemplified by the 1718–1720 &quot;Paris Sefâretnâme&quot; of Yirmisekiz Mehmed Çelebi, ambassador to the court of Louis XV of France
* the &quot;siyâsetnâme&quot; (سياست نامه), a kind of political treatise describing the functionings of state and offering advice for rulers, an early Seljuk example of which is the 11th-century &quot;Siyāsatnāma&quot;, written in Persian by Nizam al-Mulk, vizier to the Seljuk rulers Alp Arslan and Malik Shah I
* the &quot;tezkîre&quot; (تذکره), a collection of short biographies of notable figures, some of the most notable of which were the 16th-century &quot;tezkiretü&#x27;ş-şuarâ&quot;s (تذكرة الشعرا), or biographies of poets, by Latîfî and Aşık Çelebi
* the &quot;münşeât&quot; (منشآت), a collection of writings and letters similar to the Western tradition of &quot;belles-lettres&quot;
* the &quot;münâzara&quot; (مناظره), a collection of debates of either a religious or a philosophical nature

===The 19th century and Western influence===
By the early 19th century, the Ottoman Empire had become moribund. Attempts to right this situation had begun during the reign of Sultan Selim III, from 1789 to 1807, but were continuously thwarted by the powerful Janissary corps. As a result, only after Sultan Mahmud II had abolished the Janissary corps in 1826 was the way paved for truly effective reforms (Ottoman Turkish: تنظيمات &quot;tanzîmât&quot;).

These reforms finally came to the empire during the Tanzimat period of 1839–1876, when much of the Ottoman system was reorganized along largely French lines. The Tanzimat reforms &quot;were designed both to modernize the empire and to forestall foreign intervention&quot;.

Along with reforms to the Ottoman system, serious reforms were also undertaken in the literature, which had become nearly as moribund as the empire itself. Broadly, these literary reforms can be grouped into two areas:
* changes brought to the language of Ottoman written literature;
* the introduction into Ottoman literature of previously unknown genres.

The reforms to the literary language were undertaken because the Ottoman Turkish language was thought by the reformists to have effectively lost its way. It had become more divorced than ever from its original basis in Turkish, with writers using more and more words and even grammatical structures derived from Persian and Arabic, rather than Turkish. Meanwhile, however, the Turkish folk literature tradition of Anatolia, away from the capital Constantinople, came to be seen as an ideal. Accordingly, many of the reformists called for written literature to turn away from the Divan tradition and towards the folk tradition; this call for change can be seen, for example, in a famous statement by the poet and reformist Ziya Pasha (1829–1880):

&quot;Our language is not Ottoman; it is Turkish. What makes up our poetic canon is not &quot;gazel&quot;s and &quot;kasîde&quot;s, but rather &quot;kayabaşı&quot;s, &quot;üçleme&quot;s, and &quot;çöğür&quot;s&quot;&quot;, which some of our poets dislike, thinking them crude. But just let those with the ability exert the effort on this road [of change], and what powerful personalities will soon be born!&quot;
At the same time as this call—which reveals something of a burgeoning national consciousness—was being made, new literary genres were being introduced into Ottoman literature, primarily the novel and the short story. This trend began in 1861, with the translation into Ottoman Turkish of François Fénelon&#x27;s 1699 novel &quot;Les aventures de Télémaque&quot;, by Hüseyin Avni Pasha, to Sultan Abdülaziz. What is widely recognized as the first Turkish novel, &quot;Taaşuk-u Tal&#x27;at ve Fitnat&quot; (تعشق طلعت و فطنت; &quot;Tal&#x27;at and Fitnat in Love&quot;) by Şemsettin Sami (also known as Sami Frashëri) (1850–1904), was published just ten years later, in 1872. However, there had actually been, according to Gonca Gökalp, five other earlier or contemporaneous works of fiction that were clearly distinct from earlier prose traditions in both Divan and folk literature, and that approximate novelistic form. Among these five works is the &quot;Muhayyelât&quot; of Ali Aziz Efendi, cited above. Another, 1851&#x27;s &quot;Akabi Hikâyesi&quot; (&quot;Akabi&#x27;s Story&quot;), written by the Armenian Vartan Pasha (Hovsep Vartanian) using the Armenian script and for an Armenian audience was, according to Andreas Tietze, &quot;the first genuine modern novel written and published in Turkey&quot;. The introduction of such new genres into Turkish literature can be seen as part of a trend towards Westernization that continues to be felt in Turkey to this day.

Due to historically close ties with France—strengthened during the Crimean War of 1854–1856—it was French literature that came to constitute the major Western influence on Turkish literature throughout the latter half of the 19th century. As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their equivalents in the Ottoman Empire: in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of Romanticism can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the Realist and Naturalist movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the Symbolist and Parnassian movements that became paramount.

Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet Namık Kemal (1840–1888) also wrote the important 1876 novel &quot;İntibâh&quot; (انتباه; &quot;Awakening&quot;), while the journalist İbrahim Şinasi (1826–1871) is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the one-act comedy &quot;Şair Evlenmesi&quot; (شاعر اولنمسى; &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Marriage&quot;). In a similar vein, the novelist Ahmed Midhat Efendi (1844–1912) wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (حسن ملاح ياخود سر ايچيڭده اسرار &quot;Hasan Mellâh yâhud Sırr İçinde Esrâr&quot;, 1873; &quot;&quot;Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery&quot;), Realism (هﻨﻮز اون يدى يشکده &quot;Henüz On Yedi Yaşında&quot;, 1881; &quot;Just Seventeen Years Old&quot;), and Naturalism (مشاهدات &quot;Müşâhedât&quot;, 1891; &quot;Observations&quot;&quot;). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers&#x27; wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman social structure.

==Early 20th-century Turkish literature==

Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896—when the first collective literary movement arose—and 1923, when the Republic of Turkey was officially founded. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period:
* the &quot;Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde&quot; (ادبيات جدیده; &quot;New Literature&quot;) movement
* the &quot;Fecr-i Âtî&quot; (فجر آتى; &quot;Dawn of the Future&quot;) movement
* the &quot;Millî Edebiyyât&quot; (ملى ادبيات; &quot;National Literature&quot;) movement

===The New Literature movement===

The &quot;Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde&quot;, or &quot;New Literature&quot;, movement began with the founding in 1891 of the magazine &quot;Servet-i Fünûn&quot; (ﺛﺮوت ﻓﻨﻮن; &quot;Scientific Wealth&quot;), which was largely devoted to progress—both intellectual and scientific—along the Western model. Accordingly, the magazine&#x27;s literary ventures, under the direction of the poet Tevfik Fikret (1867–1915), were geared towards creating a Western-style &quot;high art&quot; in Turkey. The poetry of the group—of which Tevfik Fikret and Cenâb Şehâbeddîn (1870–1934) were the most influential proponents—was heavily influenced by the French Parnassian movement and the so-called &quot;Decadent&quot; poets. The group&#x27;s prose writers, on the other hand—particularly Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil (1867–1945)—were primarily influenced by Realism, although the writer Mehmed Rauf (1875–1931) did write the first Turkish example of a psychological novel, 1901&#x27;s &quot;Eylül&quot; (ايلول; &quot;September&quot;). The language of the &quot;Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde&quot; movement remained strongly influenced by Ottoman Turkish.

In 1901, as a result of the article &quot;Edebiyyât ve Hukuk&quot; (ادبيات و ﺣﻘﻮق; &quot;Literature and Law&quot;), translated from French and published in &quot;Servet-i Fünûn&quot;, the pressure of censorship was brought to bear and the magazine was closed down by the government of the Ottoman sultan Abdülhamid II. Though it was closed for only six months, the group&#x27;s writers each went their own way in the meantime, and the &quot;Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde&quot; movement came to an end.

===The Dawn of the Future movement===

In the 24 February 1909 edition of the &quot;Servet-i Fünûn&quot; magazine, a gathering of young writers—soon to be known as the &quot;Fecr-i Âtî&quot; (&quot;Dawn of the Future&quot;) group—released a manifesto in which they declared their opposition to the &quot;Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde&quot; movement and their adherence to the credo, &quot;Sanat şahsî ve muhteremdir&quot; (صنعت شخصى و محترمدر; &quot;Art is personal and sacred&quot;). Though this credo was little more than a variation of the French writer Théophile Gautier&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;l&#x27;art pour l&#x27;art&quot;, or &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;, the group was nonetheless opposed to the blanket importation of Western forms and styles, and essentially sought to create a recognizably Turkish literature. The &quot;Fecr-i Âtî&quot; group, however, never made a clear and unequivocal declaration of its goals and principles, and so lasted only a few years before its adherents each went their own individual way. The two outstanding figures to emerge from the movement were, in poetry, Ahmed Hâşim (1884–1933), and in prose, Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu (1889–1974).

===The National Literature movement===
In 1908, Sultan Abdülhamid II had been forced to allow a re-established constitutional government, and the parliament subsequently elected was composed almost entirely of members of the Committee of Union and Progress (also known as the &quot;Young Turks&quot;). The Young Turks (ژون تورکلر &quot;Jön Türkler&quot;) had opposed themselves to the increasingly authoritarian Ottoman government, and soon came to identify themselves with a specifically Turkish national identity. Along with this notion developed the idea of a Turkish and even pan-Turkish nation (Turkish: &quot;millet&quot;), and so the literature of this period came to be known as &quot;National Literature&quot; (Turkish: &quot;millî edebiyyât&quot;). It was during this period that the Persian- and Arabic-inflected Ottoman Turkish language was definitively turned away from as a vehicle for written literature, and that literature began to assert itself as being specifically Turkish, rather than Ottoman.

At first, this movement crystallized around the magazine &quot;Genç Kalemler&quot; (کنج قلملر; &quot;Young Pens&quot;), which was begun in the city of Selânik in 1911 by the three writers who were most representative of the movement: Ziya Gökalp (1876–1924), a sociologist and thinker; Ömer Seyfettin (1884–1920), a short-story writer; and Ali Canip Yöntem (1887–1967), a poet. In &quot;Genç Kalemler&quot;&#x27;s first issue, an article entitled &quot;New Language&quot; (Turkish: &quot;&quot;Yeni Lisan&quot;) pointed out that Turkish literature had previously looked for inspiration either to the East as in the Ottoman Divan tradition, or to the West as in the &quot;Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde&quot; and &quot;Fecr-i Âtî&quot; movements, without ever turning to Turkey itself. This latter was the National Literature movement&#x27;s primary aim.

The intrinsically nationalistic character of &quot;Genç Kalemler&quot;, however, quickly took a decidedly chauvinistic turn, and other writers—many of whom, like Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu, had been a part of the &quot;Fecr-i Âtî&quot; movement—began to emerge from within the matrix of the National Literature movement to counter this trend. Some of the more influential writers to come out of this less far-rightist branch of the National Literature movement were the poet Mehmet Emin Yurdakul (1869–1944), the early feminist novelist Halide Edib Adıvar (1884–1964), and the short-story writer and novelist Reşat Nuri Güntekin (1889–1956).

==Republican literature==
Following the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s defeat in the First World War of 1914–1918, the victorious Entente Powers began the process of carving up the empire&#x27;s lands and placing them under their own spheres of influence. In opposition to this process, the military leader Mustafa Kemal (1881–1938), in command of the growing Turkish National Movement whose roots lay partly in the Young Turks, organized the 1919–1923 Turkish War of Independence. This war ended with the official ending of the Ottoman Empire, the expulsion of the Entente Powers, and the founding of the Republic of Turkey.

The literature of the new republic emerged largely from the pre-independence National Literature movement, with its roots simultaneously in the Turkish folk tradition and in the Western notion of progress. One important change to Turkish literature was enacted in 1928, when Mustafa Kemal initiated the creation and dissemination of a modified version of the Latin alphabet to replace the Arabic-based Ottoman script. Over time, this change—together with changes in Turkey&#x27;s system of education—would lead to more widespread literacy in the country.

===Prose===
Stylistically, the prose of the early years of the Republic of Turkey was essentially a continuation of the National Literature movement, with Realism and Naturalism predominating. This trend culminated in the 1932 novel &quot;Yaban&quot; (&quot;The Wilds&quot;), by Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu. This novel can be seen as the precursor to two trends that would soon develop: social realism, and the &quot;village novel&quot; (&quot;köy romanı&quot;). &quot;Çalıkuşu&quot; (&quot;The Wren&quot;) by Reşat Nuri Güntekin addresses a similar theme with the works of Karaosmanoğlu. Güntekin&#x27;s narrative has a detailed and precise style, with a realistic tone.

The social realist movement is perhaps best represented by the short-story writer Sait Faik Abasıyanık (1906–1954), whose work sensitively and realistically treats the lives of cosmopolitan Istanbul&#x27;s lower classes and ethnic minorities, subjects which led to some criticism in the contemporary nationalistic atmosphere. The tradition of the &quot;village novel&quot;, on the other hand, arose somewhat later. As its name suggests, the &quot;village novel&quot; deals, in a generally realistic manner, with life in the villages and small towns of Turkey. The major writers in this tradition are Kemal Tahir (1910–1973), Orhan Kemal (1914–1970), and Yaşar Kemal (1923[?]–2015). Yaşar Kemal, in particular, has earned fame outside of Turkey not only for his novels—many of which, such as 1955&#x27;s &quot;İnce Memed&quot; (&quot;Memed, My Hawk&quot;), elevate local tales to the level of epic—but also for his firmly leftist political stance. In a very different tradition, but evincing a similar strong political viewpoint, was the satirical short-story writer Aziz Nesin (1915–1995) and Rıfat Ilgaz (1911–1993).

Another novelist contemporary to, but outside of, the social realist and &quot;village novel&quot; traditions is Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar (1901–1962). In addition to being an important essayist and poet, Tanpınar wrote a number of novels—such as &quot;Huzur&quot; (&quot;&quot;A Mind at Peace&quot;, 1949) and &quot;Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü&quot; (&quot;The Time Regulation Institute&quot;, 1961)—which dramatize the clash between East and West in modern Turkish culture and society. Similar problems are explored by the novelist and short-story writer Oğuz Atay (1934–1977). Unlike Tanpınar, however, Atay—in such works as his long novel &quot;Tutunamayanlar&quot; (&quot;The Good for Nothing&quot;, 1971–1972) and his short story &quot;Beyaz Mantolu Adam&quot;&quot; (&quot;Man in a White Coat&quot;, 1975)—wrote in a more modernist and existentialist vein. On the other hand, Onat Kutlar&#x27;s &quot;İshak&quot; (&quot;&quot;Isaac&quot;, 1959), composed of nine short stories which are written mainly from a child&#x27;s point of view and are often surrealistic and mystical, represent a very early example of magic realism.
The tradition of literary modernism also informs the work of female novelist Adalet Ağaoğlu (1929– ). Her trilogy of novels collectively entitled &quot;Dar Zamanlar&quot; (&quot;Tight Times&quot;, 1973–1987), for instance, examines the changes that occurred in Turkish society between the 1930s and the 1980s in a formally and technically innovative style. Orhan Pamuk (1952– ), winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature, is another such innovative novelist, though his works—such as 1990&#x27;s &quot;Beyaz Kale&quot; (&quot;The White Castle&quot;) and &quot;Kara Kitap&quot; (&quot;The Black Book&quot;) and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Benim Adım Kırmızı&quot; (&quot;My Name is Red&quot;)—are influenced more by postmodernism than by modernism. This is true also of Latife Tekin (1957– ), whose first novel &quot;Sevgili Arsız Ölüm&quot; (&quot;Dear Shameless Death&quot;&quot;, 1983) shows the influence not only of postmodernism, but also of magic realism. Elif Şafak has been one of the most outstanding authors of Turkish literature which has new tendencies in language and theme in 2000s. Şafak was distinguished first by her use of extensive vocabulary and then became one of the pioneers in Turkish literature in international scope as a bilingual author who writes both in Turkish and in English.

A recent study by Can and Patton provides a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors ranging from Mehmet Rauf&#x27;s (1875–1931) &quot;Eylül&quot; (1901) to Ahmet Altan&#x27;s (1950–) &quot;Kılıç Yarası Gibi&quot; (1998). They show using statistical analysis that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language reform of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in the early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems. Can and Patton; based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of &quot;ama&quot; over &quot;fakat&quot;, both borrowed from Arabic and meaning &#x27;but&#x27;, and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant); also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors.

===Poetry===

In the early years of the Republic of Turkey, there were a number of poetic trends. Authors such as Ahmed Hâşim and Yahyâ Kemâl Beyatlı (1884–1958) continued to write important formal verse whose language was, to a great extent, a continuation of the late Ottoman tradition. By far the majority of the poetry of the time, however, was in the tradition of the folk-inspired &quot;syllabist&quot; movement (&quot;Beş Hececiler&quot;), which had emerged from the National Literature movement and which tended to express patriotic themes couched in the syllabic meter associated with Turkish folk poetry.

The first radical step away from this trend was taken by Nâzım Hikmet Ran, who—during his time as a student in the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1924—was exposed to the modernist poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky and others, which inspired him to start writing verse in a less formal style. At this time, he wrote the poem &quot;Açların Gözbebekleri&quot; (&quot;Pupils of the Hungry&quot;), which introduced free verse into the Turkish language for, essentially, the first time. Much of Nâzım Hikmet&#x27;s poetry subsequent to this breakthrough would continue to be written in free verse, though his work exerted little influence for some time due largely to censorship of his work owing to his Communist political stance, which also led to his spending several years in prison. Over time, in such books as &quot;Simavne Kadısı Oğlu Şeyh Bedreddin Destanı&quot; (&quot;&quot;The Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin, Son of Judge Simavne&quot;, 1936) and &quot;Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları&quot; (&quot;Human Landscapes from My Country&quot;, 1939), he developed a voice simultaneously proclamatory and subtle.
Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the publication of a small volume of verse preceded by an essay and entitled &quot;Garip&quot; (&quot;Strange&quot;&quot;). The authors were Orhan Veli Kanık (1914–1950), Melih Cevdet Anday (1915–2002), and Oktay Rifat (1914–1988). Explicitly opposing themselves to everything that had gone in poetry before, they sought instead to create a popular art, &quot;to explore the people&#x27;s tastes, to determine them, and to make them reign supreme over art&quot;. To this end, and inspired in part by contemporary French poets like Jacques Prévert, they employed not only a variant of the free verse introduced by Nâzım Hikmet, but also highly colloquial language, and wrote primarily about mundane daily subjects and the ordinary man on the street. The reaction was immediate and polarized: most of the academic establishment and older poets vilified them, while much of the Turkish population embraced them wholeheartedly. Though the movement itself lasted only ten years—until Orhan Veli&#x27;s death in 1950, after which Melih Cevdet Anday and Oktay Rifat moved on to other styles—its effect on Turkish poetry continues to be felt today.

Just as the Garip movement was a reaction against earlier poetry, so—in the 1950s and afterwards—was there a reaction against the Garip movement. The poets of this movement, soon known as &quot;İkinci Yeni&quot; (&quot;Second New&quot;,) opposed themselves to the social aspects prevalent in the poetry of Nâzım Hikmet and the Garip poets, and instead—partly inspired by the disruption of language in such Western movements as Dada and Surrealism—sought to create a more abstract poetry through the use of jarring and unexpected language, complex images, and the association of ideas. To some extent, the movement can be seen as bearing some of the characteristics of postmodern literature. The most well-known poets writing in the &quot;Second New&quot; vein were Turgut Uyar (1927–1985), Edip Cansever (1928–1986), Cemal Süreya (1931–1990), Ece Ayhan (1931–2002), Sezai Karakoç (1933– ), İlhan Berk (1918–2008).

Outside of the Garip and &quot;Second New&quot; movements also, a number of significant poets have flourished, such as Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca (1914–2008), who wrote poems dealing with fundamental concepts like life, death, God, time, and the cosmos; Behçet Necatigil (1916–1979), whose somewhat allegorical poems explore the significance of middle-class daily life; Can Yücel (1926–1999), who—in addition to his own highly colloquial and varied poetry—was also a translator into Turkish of a variety of world literature; İsmet Özel (1944– ), whose early poetry was highly leftist but whose poetry since the 1970s has shown a strong mystical and even Islamist influence; and Hasan Hüseyin Korkmazgil (1927–1984) who wrote collectivist-realist poetry.

30,000 new titles appear yearly, often in small numbers. 9 verso 17 Euro (pro pocket book/hardcover) – at an average earning of less than 600 Euro monthly – are rather unattractive, where illegal copies at bazaars cost two-thirds less. &quot;Official Certificates&quot; for legally published books do not solve the problem, because controlling the illegal book trade remains difficult.

5,000 of 10,000 book shops in Turkey are in Istanbul, including the bookfair and growing licence trading. Turkey was a guest of honour at the Frankfurt Bookfair in 2008.

<doc id="576610" wikidata="Q15607934" url="?curid=576610" title="Service module">
<text>A service module (also known as an equipment module or instrument compartment) is a component of a crewed space capsule containing a variety of support systems used for spacecraft operations. Usually located in the uninhabited area of the spacecraft, the service module serves a storehouse of critical subsystems and supplies for the mission such as electrical systems, environmental control, and propellant tanks. The service module is jettisoned upon the completion of the mission, and usually burns up during atmospheric reentry.

The Russian phrase for &quot;service module&quot; for the Soyuz spacecraft is sometimes more directly translated &quot;Instrument-Assembly Compartment&quot;. This comes from the design feature of having the guidance and other computer systems in a separate pressure chamber (the instruments) from the rocket engines, their propellant tanks, and the life support tanks (from the German &quot;Aggregat&quot;, which gets translated &quot;assembly&quot;). The Russians use the term &quot;module&quot; (модуль) primarily in regards to elements of a modular space station, e.g. the Zvezda Service Module.

==Design==
Depending upon the spacecraft architecture and system design, a typical service module usually contain the following:
* Fuel cells, solar panels, or batteries to provide electrical power to the spacecraft (batteries are also used in the crew capsule)
* Liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) for fuel cell operation and water production, with LOX also being used to provide breathing oxygen for the crew.
* Pressurized helium or nitrogen to force consumables and fuel from source tanks to their destinations.
* Guidance computer systems and related sensors
* Fuel and oxidizer for reaction control and propulsion systems.
* Thermal control systems for proper heating and cooling of above systems.

While this would be used for a &quot;baseline&quot; service module, a service module may also be modified for additional functions. An example would be the equipment module on Gemini 9, when it was modified to carry the U.S. Air Force-developed astronaut maneuvering unit that would have been tested by astronaut Eugene Cernan, but was cancelled when his spacesuit overheated, causing his visor to fog up. But the best example would be the final three Apollo missions, in which the J-series service modules included scientific instrument module (SIM) bays that took pictures and other readouts in lunar orbit. In addition to the film cameras, similar to those used on the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft and requiring the Command Module Pilot to perform a deep-space EVA during the return trip, two of the SIM bays, on Apollos 15 and 16, also launched a lunar &quot;subsatellite&quot; before the astronauts performed the Trans-Earth Injection burn with the onboard service propulsion system.

A unique inhabitable variation of the service module concept is the Functional Cargo Block developed for the Soviet TKS Transport Supply Spacecraft. In addition to full functionality of a service module, it featured a sizeable pressurized cargo bay, and a docking port – as opposed to its conventional location on the front of the re-entry capsule, which in case of the TKS instead possessed its own downscaled service module with de-orbiting thrusters – allowing the FGB to remain docked as an extension of the space station.

== Operating service modules ==

=== Zvezda (ISS module) ===

The &quot;Zvezda Service Module&quot;, is a module of the International Space Station (ISS). It was the third module launched to the station, and provides all of the station&#x27;s life support systems, some of which are supplemented in the US Orbital Segment (USOS), as well as living quarters for two crew members. It is the structural and functional center of the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS), which is the Russian part of the ISS. Crew assemble here to deal with emergencies on the station. &quot;Zvezda&quot; was launched on a Proton launch vehicle on 12 July 2000, and docked with the &quot;Zarya&quot; module on 26 July 2000.

=== Soyuz service module ===

At the back of the Soyuz spacecraft is the Service Module. It has a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can (instrumentation compartment, priborniy otsek) that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range radio communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. A non-pressurized part of the Service Module (propulsion compartment, agregatniy otsek) contains the main engine and a liquid-fuelled propulsion system for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. Outside the Service Module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the Sun by rotating the ship.

=== Shenzhou service module ===

The aft service module of the Shenzhou spacecraft contains life support and other equipment required for the functioning of Shenzhou. Two pairs of solar panels, one pair on the service module and the other pair on the orbital module, have a total area of over 40 m2 (430 ft2), indicating average electrical power over 1.5 kW.

=== European Service Module (Orion) ===

The European Service Module is the service module component of the Orion spacecraft, serving as its primary power and propulsion component until it is discarded at the end of each mission. The service module supports the crew module from launch through separation prior to reentry. It provides in-space propulsion capability for orbital transfer, attitude control, and high altitude ascent aborts. It provides the water and oxygen needed for a habitable environment, generates and stores electrical power, and maintains the temperature of the vehicle&#x27;s systems and components. This module can also transport unpressurized cargo and scientific payloads.

<text>Kumpupintil Lake (), formerly known as Lake Disappointment, is an endorheic salt lake located in the Little Sandy Desert, east of the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

==Description==

Kumpupintil Lake is about long and located east of Newman.

The lake typically is dry, except during very wet periods such as the 1900 floods and in many recent tropical wet seasons since 1967. It lies on the Tropic of Capricorn, due east of the mining town of and the . It is at the northern side of the Little Sandy Desert and south of the Karlamilyi National Park. The Canning Stock Route passes down the western shores of the lake and the surrounds consist mostly of sand dunes. Its elevation is 325 metres (1066 ft) above mean sea level.

The lake is important to Martu people for spiritual and ceremonial reasons, as well as being an important place for water and traditional food.

The lake is home to many species of water birds. The discovery of a new species of dragon lizard, &quot;Ctenophorus nguyarna&quot;, at the site was announced in 2007.

==Mythology==

In indigenous culture, &quot;Kumpupintil&quot; was off-limits to the tribes neighbouring the area, such as the Kurajarra, Wanman, Kartudjara and the Putidjara. The reason for the taboo, existing down to modern times, derives from the lake&#x27;s mythological associations with the &quot;Ngayurnangalku&quot; spirits thought to live below its surface. This prohibition extended to flying over the area, since the Ngayurnangalku, ancestral cannibal beings with pointy teeth and clawlike fingernails, are deemed capable of attacking even planes that intrude over the lake&#x27;s airspace.

The Aboriginal people told a story about how the Ngayurnangalku were split into the &#x27;good&#x27; and the &#x27;bad&#x27; over a debate on whether or not they should continue to eat people. One group decided that they would stop participating in cannibalism and were only kept safe by &#x27;bodyguards&#x27;. The other group continued to follow cannibalism. Aboriginal stockmen would muffle their horses&#x27; bells so that they would not alert the cannibals to their presence when they approached the lake.

==Name==
The lake known to the Western Desert Martu people as Kumpupintil was named Lake Disappointment by the explorer Frank Hann in 1897. Hann was in the area exploring the east Pilbara, around Rudall River. He noticed creeks in the area flowed inland, and followed them, expecting to find a large fresh water lake. The lake was typically dry and so was named Lake Disappointment.

On November 11, 2020, Kumpupintil Lake was formally approved by the Western Australian Government agency Landgate as the official name, following a request from the traditional owners and the Western Desert Lands Aboriginal Corporation.

The name &quot;Kumpupintil&quot; describes how the lake was made and is linked to a Martu creation story where Martu warriors fought mighty giants in an epic battle.

In January 1950, Evans was tried and convicted of the murder of his daughter, and on 9 March he was executed by hanging.

During his trial, Evans accused his downstairs neighbour, John Christie, who was the chief prosecution witness in the case against him, of committing the murders. 

Three years after Evans&#x27;s execution, Christie was found to be a serial killer who had murdered several other women in the same house, including his own wife Ethel. Christie was himself sentenced to death, and while awaiting execution, he confessed to having murdered Mrs. Evans. An official inquiry concluded in 1966 that Christie had murdered Evans&#x27;s daughter Geraldine, and Evans was granted a posthumous pardon. The High Court dismissed proceedings to officially quash Evans&#x27;s murder conviction in 2004 on the grounds of the cost and resources that would be involved, but acknowledged that Evans did not murder his wife or his daughter, 54 years after his wrongful execution.

The case generated much controversy and is acknowledged to be a miscarriage of justice. Along with those of Derek Bentley and Ruth Ellis, the case played a major part in the removal of capital punishment for murder in 1965 and, later, its abolition for all crimes.

==Early life==
Evans was a native of Merthyr Tydfil in Glamorgan, Wales. His father Daniel abandoned the family in April 1924 before Evans&#x27;s birth. Evans had an older sister, Eileen, born in 1921 and a younger half-sister, Maureen, who was born in September 1929. Evans&#x27;s mother remarried in September 1933. As a child, Evans had difficulty learning to speak and struggled at school. Following an accident when he was eight, Evans developed a tubercular verruca on his right foot that never completely healed and caused him to miss considerable amounts of time from school for treatments, further setting back his education. As a result, when he reached adulthood Evans possessed low literacy skills, often needing others to read lengthy documents to him, although he did possess some ability to read simple passages such as in comics, newspaper football reports and on his wages and receipts. He liked boxing and football, supporting Queens Park Rangers, as did Christie. He was also prone to inventing stories about himself to boost his self-esteem, a trait that continued into adulthood and interfered with his efforts to establish credibility when dealing with the police and courts.

In 1935, his mother and her second husband moved to London, and Evans worked as a painter and decorator while attending school. He returned to Merthyr Tydfil in 1937 and briefly worked in the coal mines but had to resign because of continuing problems with his foot. In 1939, he returned to London to live again with his mother, and in 1946 they moved to St Mark&#x27;s Road, Notting Hill. This was just over two minutes&#x27; walk from 10 Rillington Place, his future residence after he married. Evans was fined 60 shillings at West London Magistrates’ Court on 25 April 1946 for stealing a car, and driving without insurance or a licence.

==Married life==
On 20 September 1947, Evans married Beryl Susanna Thorley, whom he had met in January 1947 on a blind date. The couple initially lived with Evans&#x27;s family at St Mark&#x27;s Road but after Beryl discovered she was pregnant in 1948 they moved into the top-floor flat at 10 Rillington Place in the Ladbroke Grove area of Notting Hill. Their neighbours in the ground-floor flat were the serial killer John Christie, then working as a post office clerk, and his wife, Ethel Christie. Timothy&#x27;s and Beryl&#x27;s daughter Geraldine was born on 10 October 1948.

Their marriage was characterised by angry quarrels; Beryl was alleged to be a poor housekeeper and incapable of managing the family&#x27;s finances, while Timothy misspent his wages on alcohol, and his heavy drinking at the time exacerbated his already short temper. The arguments between Timothy and Beryl were loud enough to be heard by the neighbours and physical violence between them was witnessed on several occasions. In 1949, Beryl revealed to Timothy that she was pregnant with their second child. Since the family was already struggling financially, Beryl decided to have an abortion. After some initial reluctance, Evans agreed to this course of action.

==Events leading to Evans&#x27;s arrest==

Several weeks later, on 30 November 1949, Evans informed police at Merthyr Tydfil that his wife had died in unusual circumstances. His first confession was that he had accidentally killed her by giving her something in a bottle that a man had given him to abort the foetus; he had then disposed of her body in a sewer drain outside 10 Rillington Place. He told the police that after arranging for Geraldine to be looked after, he had gone to Wales. When police examined the drain outside the front of the building, however, they found nothing and, furthermore, discovered that the manhole cover required the combined strength of three officers to remove it.

When re-questioned, Evans changed his story and said that Christie had offered to perform an abortion on Beryl. Evans stated that he had left Christie out of his first statement in order to protect him (abortion being illegal in the UK at this time). After some deliberation between Evans and his wife, they had both agreed to take up Christie&#x27;s offer. On 8 November, Evans had returned home from work to be informed by Christie that the abortion had not worked and that Beryl was dead. Christie had said that he would dispose of the body and would make arrangements for a couple from East Acton to look after Geraldine. He said that Evans should leave London for the meantime. On 14 November, Evans left for Wales to stay with relatives. Evans said he later returned to 10 Rillington Place to ask about Geraldine, but Christie had refused to let him see her.

In response to Evans&#x27;s second statement, the police performed a preliminary search of 10 Rillington Place but did not uncover anything incriminating, despite the presence of a human thigh bone supporting a fence post in the tiny (about ) garden. On a more thorough search on 2 December, the police found the body of Beryl Evans, wrapped in a tablecloth in the wash-house in the back garden. Access to the locked wash-house was only possible by using a knife kept by Mrs. Christie. Significantly, the body of Geraldine was also found alongside Beryl&#x27;s body – Evans had not mentioned he had killed his daughter in either of his statements. Beryl and Geraldine had both been strangled.

Although they examined the garden, the police did not find traces of the skeletal remains of two prior victims of Christie, despite their shallow burial. Christie actually removed the skull of Miss Eady when his dog dug it up from the garden around this time, and he disposed of it in a bombed-out building nearby. This vital clue was ignored when the skull was then discovered by children playing in the ruins and handed in to police.

When Evans was shown the clothing taken from the bodies of his wife and child, he was also informed that both had been strangled. This was, according to Evans&#x27;s statement, the first occasion in which he was informed that his baby daughter had been killed. He was asked whether he was responsible for their deaths. To this, Evans apparently responded, &quot;Yes.&quot; He then apparently confessed to having strangled Beryl during an argument over debts and strangling Geraldine two days later, after which he left for Wales.

This confession, along with other contradictory statements Evans made during the police interrogation, has been cited as proof of his guilt. Several authors who have written about the case have argued that the police provided Evans with all the necessary details for him to make a plausible confession, which they may have in turn edited further while transcribing it. Furthermore, the police interrogated Evans over the course of late evening and early morning hours to his physical and emotional detriment, a man already in a highly emotional state. Evans later stated in court that he thought he would be subjected to violence by the police if he did not confess, and this fear along with the shock of discovering that both his wife and daughter had been strangled, likely induced him to make a false confession. The police investigation was marred by a lack of forensic expertise, with significant evidence overlooked.

&quot;The Psychology of Interrogations and Confessions&quot; (2003) states that some of the phraseology of the confession seemed more in line with language a police officer might use, rather than that used by an illiterate man as Evans was. Evans was kept in solitary confinement for two days before being handed over to the London police. He did not know what was happening other than his wife&#x27;s body had not been found in the drain as expected. At Notting Hill police station, he was shown his wife&#x27;s and daughter&#x27;s clothing, and the ligature which had been used to strangle his daughter. This book cites Ludovic Kennedy as a source for the conclusion that Evans felt tremendous guilt over not doing more to prevent the deaths of his wife and daughter, and particularly that his daughter&#x27;s murder must have been a tremendous shock.

==Trial and execution==
Evans was put on trial for the murder of his daughter on 11 January 1950 before Mr Justice Lewis and a jury. In accordance with legal practice at the time, the prosecution proceeded only with the single charge of murder, that concerning Geraldine. Beryl&#x27;s murder, with which Evans was still formally charged, was not formally before the court, though evidence that he had murdered Beryl was used with the aim of establishing Evans&#x27;s guilt of the murder of Geraldine. Evans, who was represented by Malcolm Morris, withdrew his confession during consultations with his solicitor and alleged that Christie was responsible for the murders in accordance with his second statement given to the police at Merthyr Tydfil. Although this allegation was dismissed by the court as &quot;fantastic&quot; and Evans&#x27;s solicitors had also warned him that it was difficult to prove, Evans maintained this defence until his execution. It was subsequently found that his allegation was true.

Christie and his wife, Ethel, were key witnesses for the prosecution. Christie denied that he had offered to abort Beryl&#x27;s unborn child and gave detailed evidence about the quarrels between Evans and his wife. The defence sought to show that Christie was the murderer, highlighting his past criminal record. Christie had previous convictions for several thefts and for malicious wounding. The latter case involved Christie striking a woman on the head with a cricket bat. But his apparent reform, and his service with the police as a special constable, may have impressed the jury. The defence also could not find a motive for which a respected person like Christie would murder two people, whereas the prosecution could use the explanation in Evans&#x27;s confessions as Evans&#x27;s motive. Unlike Christie, Evans had no previous convictions for violence, though he had been fined for theft and motoring offences. His conflicting statements undermined his credibility. Had the police conducted a thorough search of the garden and found the bones of two previous victims of Christie, the trial of Evans might not have occurred at all.

The case largely came down to Christie&#x27;s word against Evans&#x27;s and the course of the trial turned against Evans. The trial lasted only three days and much key evidence was omitted, or never shown to the jury. Evans was found guilty – the jury taking just 40 minutes to come to its decision. After a failed appeal held before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard; Mr Justice Sellers and Mr Justice Humphreys on 20 February, Evans was hanged on 9 March 1950 by Albert Pierrepoint, assisted by Syd Dernley at Pentonville Prison.

The safety of Evans&#x27;s conviction was severely criticised when Christie&#x27;s murders were discovered three years later. During interviews with police and psychiatrists prior to his execution, Christie admitted several times that he had been responsible for the murder of Beryl Evans. If these confessions were true, Evans&#x27;s second statement detailing Christie&#x27;s offer to abort Beryl&#x27;s baby is likely to be the true version of events that took place at Rillington Place on 8 November 1949. Ludovic Kennedy provided one possible reconstruction of how the murder took place, surmising that an unsuspecting Beryl let Christie into her flat, expecting the abortion to be carried out, but was instead attacked and then strangled. Christie claimed to have possibly engaged in sexual intercourse with Beryl&#x27;s body after her death (he claimed to be unable to remember the precise details) but her post-mortem had failed to uncover evidence of sexual intercourse. In his confessions to Beryl&#x27;s death, Christie denied he had agreed to carry out an abortion on Beryl. He instead claimed to have strangled her while being intimate with her, or that she had wanted to commit suicide and he helped her do so.

One important fact was not brought up in Evans&#x27;s trial: two workmen were willing to testify that there were no bodies in the wash-house when they worked there several days after Evans supposedly hid them. They stored their tools in the wash-room (a small outhouse measuring ) and cleaned it out completely when they finished their work on 11 November. Their evidence in itself would have raised doubts about the veracity of Evans&#x27;s alleged confessions, but the workmen were not called to give evidence. Indeed, the police re-interviewed the workmen and forced them to change their evidence to fit the preconceived idea that Evans was the sole murderer. The murderer, Christie, would have hidden the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine in the temporarily vacant first-floor flat, and then moved them to the wash-house four days later when the workmen had finished.

==John Christie==
Three years later, Christie vacated his premises at 10 Rillington Place and the landlord allowed an upstairs tenant, Beresford Brown, to use Christie&#x27;s kitchen. Brown found the bodies of three women (Kathleen Maloney, Rita Nelson and Hectorina Maclennan) hidden in a papered-over kitchen pantry, a recess immediately next to the wash-house where Beryl and Geraldine Evans had been found. A further search of the building and grounds turned up three more bodies: Christie&#x27;s wife, Ethel, under the floorboards of the front room; Ruth Fuerst, an Austrian nurse and munitions worker; and Muriel Eady, a former colleague of Christie, who were both buried in the right-hand side of the small back garden of the building. Christie had even used one of their thigh bones to prop up a trellis in the garden, which the police had missed in their earlier searches of the property.

Christie was arrested on 31 March 1953, and during the course of interrogation confessed four separate times to killing Beryl Evans, although he had never admitted to killing Geraldine Evans. He confessed to murdering Fuerst and Eady, saying he had stored their bodies in the wash-room before burying them in shallow graves in the garden. It was in the same wash-room that the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine Evans had been found during the investigation into their murders. Christie was found guilty of murdering his wife and was hanged on 15 July 1953 by Albert Pierrepoint, the same hangman who had executed Evans at the same prison three years prior.

Because Christie&#x27;s crimes raised doubts about Evans&#x27;s guilt in the murders of his wife and daughter, the serving Home Secretary, David Maxwell-Fyfe, commissioned an inquiry to investigate the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. It was chaired by the Recorder of Portsmouth, John Scott Henderson, QC. The inquiry ran for one week and its findings upheld Evans&#x27;s guilt in both murders with the explanation that Christie&#x27;s confessions of murdering Beryl Evans were unreliable because they were made in the context of supporting his defence that he was insane. The conclusion was met with scepticism by the press and the public alike: if Christie&#x27;s confessions were unreliable, why should those of Evans be acceptable? The inquiry ignored vital evidence and led to more questions in Parliament, especially from Geoffrey Bing, Reginald Paget, Sydney Silverman, Michael Foot and many other MPs. The controversy was to continue until it led eventually to the exculpation of Evans and a declaration of his innocence of the murder of both his wife and his daughter.

The murder of Beryl Evans was never a primary charge in the trials of either Evans or Christie. The former had been charged with the murder of his daughter and the latter with the murder of Mrs. Christie. Hence questions that went to the murder of Mrs. Evans were not those with which the trials were especially concerned. When Christie was later the subject of the Scott Henderson Inquiry, questions drafted by a solicitor representing Evans&#x27;s mother were deemed not relevant and Scott Henderson retained the right of deciding if they could be asked.

==Campaign to overturn Evans&#x27;s conviction==
In 1955, David Astor, editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, Ian Gilmour, editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, John Grigg, editor of &quot;The National and English Review&quot;, and Sir Lynton Andrews, editor of &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot;, formed a delegation to petition the Home Secretary for a new inquiry because of their dissatisfaction with the conclusions of the Scott Henderson Inquiry. In the same year, barrister Michael Eddowes examined the case and wrote the book &quot;The Man on Your Conscience&quot;, which argued that Evans could not have been the killer on the basis that if he were, there were a number of extraordinary coincidences with his crimes and Christie&#x27;s, most notably that two strangler murderers, who both used a ligature to kill their victims, had been living in the same property at the same time, unknown to each other.

The television journalist Ludovic Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;Ten Rillington Place&quot; criticised the police investigation and evidence submitted at the 1950 trial in which Evans was found guilty. This produced another Parliamentary debate in 1961 but still no second inquiry.

In 1965, Liberal Party politician Herbert Wolfe of Darlington, County Durham contacted Harold Evans, then editor of &quot;The Northern Echo&quot;. He and Kennedy formed the Timothy Evans Committee. The result of a prolonged campaign was that the Home Secretary, Sir Frank Soskice, ordered a new inquiry chaired by High Court judge Sir Daniel Brabin in 1965–66. Brabin found it was &quot;more probable than not&quot; that Evans murdered his wife and that he did not murder his daughter. This was contrary to the prosecution case in Evans&#x27;s trial, which held that both murders had been committed by the same person as a single act. The victims&#x27; bodies had been found together in the same location and had been murdered in the same way by strangulation.

Brabin went to great lengths to prefer police evidence wherever possible and exonerate them of any misconduct, and he did not address the allegations made by Kennedy about the validity of several of the confessions allegedly made by Evans. He also did not consider the incompetence of the police in their searches of the garden at Rillington Place. The enquiry did little to settle the many issues which arose from the case, but, by exonerating Evans of killing his child, was crucial in subsequent events.

Since Evans had only been convicted of his daughter&#x27;s murder, Roy Jenkins, Soskice&#x27;s successor as Home Secretary, recommended a royal pardon for Evans, which was granted in October 1966. In 1965, Evans&#x27;s remains were exhumed from Pentonville Prison and reburied in St Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery in Leytonstone, Greater London. The outcry over the Evans case contributed to the suspension and then abolition of capital punishment in the United Kingdom.

==Status of Evans&#x27;s guilty verdict==

In January 2003, the Home Office awarded Timothy Evans&#x27;s half-sister, Mary Westlake, and his sister, Eileen Ashby, &quot;ex gratia&quot; payments as compensation for the miscarriage of justice in Evans&#x27;s trial. The independent assessor for the Home Office, Lord Brennan QC, accepted that &quot;the conviction and execution of Timothy Evans for the murder of his child was wrongful and a miscarriage of justice&quot; and that &quot;there is no evidence to implicate Timothy Evans in the murder of his wife. She was most probably murdered by Christie.&quot; Lord Brennan believed that the Brabin Report&#x27;s conclusion that Evans probably murdered his wife should be rejected given Christie&#x27;s confessions and conviction.

On 16 November 2004, Westlake began an application for judicial review in the High Court, challenging a decision by the Criminal Cases Review Commission not to refer Evans&#x27;s case to the Court of Appeal to have his conviction formally quashed. She argued that Evans&#x27;s pardon had not formally expunged his conviction of murdering his daughter, and although the Brabin report had concluded that Evans probably did not kill his daughter, it had not declared him innocent. The report also contained the &quot;devastating&quot; conclusion that Evans had probably killed his wife. The request to refer the case was dismissed on 19 November 2004, with the judges saying that the cost and resources of quashing the conviction could not be justified, as there is no &quot;tangible benefit&quot; when &quot;the convicted person has been executed and there are no other penalties ensuing&quot;, although they believe &quot;Timothy Evans should indeed be regarded as having been innocent of the charge of which he was convicted.&quot;

==In media==
* Ewan MacColl wrote the song &quot;The Ballad of Tim Evans&quot; (also known as &quot;Go Down You Murderer&quot;) about the case. MacColl said in his autobiography that the song was used in many news programmes and documentaries, but that many broadcasters were uncomfortable with the last verse which reads &quot;They sent Tim Evans to the drop for a crime he did not do / It was Christy was the murderer and the judge and jury too.&quot; In some recordings of the song, this is altered to: &quot;It was Christy was the murderer and everybody knew / They sent Tim Evans to the drop for a crime he didn&#x27;t do.&quot; The song was covered by the American folk singer Judy Collins.
* The film &quot;10 Rillington Place&quot; was released in the UK on 10 February 1971. It was directed by Richard Fleischer and starred Richard Attenborough as John Christie, Judy Geeson as Beryl Evans, John Hurt as Timothy Evans, and Pat Heywood as Ethel Christie.
* In the 2016 BBC dramatisation &quot;Rillington Place&quot;, Evans was portrayed by Nico Mirallegro.
* According to &quot;Yes Minister&quot; co-writer Antony Jay, the Evans case was part of the inspiration for the television satire because of Frank Soskice&#x27;s refusal to reopen the case despite having himself appealed for an inquiry while in opposition.
* &quot;The Ballad of Tim Evans&quot; is used as background in a scene in &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot; and performed by actor and musician Alex Hassilev. The song serves as foreshadowing.

<text>Cy Coleman (born Seymour Kaufman; June 14, 1929 – November 18, 2004) was an American composer, songwriter, and jazz pianist.

==Life and career==
Coleman was born Seymour Kaufman in New York City, to Eastern European Jewish parents, and was raised in the Bronx. His mother, Ida (née Prizent) was an apartment landlady and his father was a brickmason. He was a child prodigy who gave piano recitals at venues such as Steinway Hall, Town Hall, and Carnegie Hall between the ages of six and nine. Before beginning his fabled Broadway career, he led the Cy Coleman Trio, which made many recordings and was a much-in-demand club attraction.

Despite the early classical and jazz success, Coleman decided to build a career in popular music. His first collaborator was Joseph Allen McCarthy, but his most successful early partnership, albeit a turbulent one, was with Carolyn Leigh. The pair wrote many pop hits, including &quot;Witchcraft&quot; and &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;. One of his instrumentals, &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Theme,&quot; became the signature music of the regular syndicated late night TV show &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot; in the 1960s. This included specials presented by the editor/publisher Hugh M. Hefner of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, and remains synonymous with the Chicago magazine and its creator, Hefner.

Coleman&#x27;s career as a Broadway composer began when he and Leigh collaborated on &quot;Wildcat&quot; (1960), which marked the Broadway debut of movie/television comedienne Lucille Ball. The score included the hit tune &quot;Hey, Look Me Over&quot;. When Ball became ill, she left the show, and it closed. Next for the two was &quot;Little Me&quot;, with a book by Neil Simon based on the novel of the same name by Patrick Dennis. The show introduced &quot;Real Live Girl&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Your Number,&quot; which became popular standards.

In 1964, Coleman met Dorothy Fields at a party, and when he asked if she would like to collaborate with him, she is reported to have answered: &quot;Thank God somebody asked.&quot; Fields was revitalized by working with the much younger Coleman, and by the contemporary nature of their first project, which was &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, again with a book by Simon, starring Gwen Verdon, and introducing the songs &quot;If My Friends Could See Me Now&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Brass Band&quot;, &quot;Big Spender&quot; and &quot;The Rhythm of Life&quot;. The show was a major success and Coleman found working with Fields much easier than with Leigh. The partnership was to work on two more shows – an aborted project about Eleanor Roosevelt, and &quot;Seesaw&quot; which reached Broadway in 1973 after a troubled out-of-town tour. Despite mixed reviews, the show enjoyed a healthy run. The partnership was cut short by Fields&#x27; death in 1974.

Coleman remained prolific in the late 1970s. He collaborated on &quot;I Love My Wife&quot; (1977) with Michael Stewart, &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; (1978) with Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and &quot;Home Again, Home Again&quot; with Barbara Fried, although the latter never reached Broadway. Also in 1970, he produced the single &quot;Lying Here&quot; (Mercury 73150) for the Rock opera &quot;Sensations&quot;, and took a full-page (back cover) advert in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine to promote his upcoming star vocalist Steve Leeds.
In 1980, Coleman served as producer and composer for the circus-themed &quot;Barnum&quot;, which co-starred Jim Dale and Glenn Close. Later in the decade, he collaborated on &quot;Welcome to the Club&quot; (1988) with A. E. Hotchner, and &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1989) with David Zippel. In the latter, inspired by the hard-boiled detective film noir of the 1930s and 1940s, he returned to his jazz roots, and the show was a huge critical and commercial success. The 1990s brought more new Coleman musicals to Broadway: &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot; (1991), again with Comden and Green, &quot;The Life&quot; (1997), a gritty look at pimps, prostitutes, and assorted other lowlife in the big city, with Ira Gasman, and a revised production of &quot;Little Me&quot;.

Coleman&#x27;s film scores include &quot;Father Goose&quot;, &quot;The Art of Love&quot;, &quot;Garbo Talks&quot;, &quot;Power&quot;, and &quot;Family Business&quot;. In addition, he wrote memorable television specials for Shirley MacLaine, &quot;If My Friends Could See Me Now&quot; and &quot;Gypsy in My Soul&quot;. Coleman has been the only composer to win consecutive Tony awards for Best Score at the same time that the corresponding musicals won for Best Musical: &quot;City of Angels&quot; and &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot; (although Stephen Sondheim actually won three consecutive Tony Awards for Best Score for &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Follies&quot;, and &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, &quot;Follies&quot; did not win for Best Musical). Coleman was on the ASCAP Board of Directors for many years and also served as their Vice Chairman Writer.

One final musical with a Coleman score played in Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum between December 2003 and January 2004, under the title &quot;Like Jazz&quot;, as a Broadway tryout. Investor Transamerica Capital went forward with plans to mount a Broadway production renamed &quot;In the Pocket&quot;. Dirk Decloedt and Maurice Hines were announced as director and choreographer with an anticipated opening in Spring 2006 but it never opened.

== Education ==
Coleman studied at New York&#x27;s The High School of Music &amp; Art and the New York College of Music, graduating in 1948.

==Death==
Coleman died of cardiac arrest at 11:59 pm on November 18, 2004, at New York Hospital, aged 75. He was survived by his wife, Shelby Coleman (née Brown) and their adopted daughter, Lily Cye Coleman (born in 2000). To the very end, he was part of the Broadway scene – he had attended the premiere of Michael Frayn&#x27;s new play &quot;Democracy&quot; earlier on November 18.

<text>Nicholas Rescher (; ; 15 July 1928 – 5 January 2024) was a German-born American philosopher, polymath, and author, who was a professor of philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh from 1961. He was chairman of the Center for Philosophy of Science and chairman of the philosophy department.

Rescher served as president of the American Catholic Philosophical Association, Leibniz Society of North America, American Metaphysical Society, American Philosophical Association, and Charles S. Peirce Society. He was the founder of &quot;American Philosophical Quarterly&quot;, &quot;History of Philosophy Quarterly&quot;, and &quot;Public Affairs Quarterly&quot;. He died in Pittsburgh on January 5, 2024, at the age of 95.

==Early life and education==
Rescher was born in Hagen in the Westphalia region of Germany. In his autobiography he traces his descent to Nehemias Rescher (1735–1801), a founder of the Hochberg-Remseck Jewish community in Swabian Germany. He relocated to the United States when he was 10 and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1944. In 1949 he obtained a degree in mathematics at Queens College, New York, thereafter attending Princeton University and graduating with a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1951 at the age of 22, the youngest person to earn a Ph.D. in that department. From 1952 to 1954 during the Korean War he served a term in the United States Marine Corps, and then from 1954 to 1957 he worked for the Rand Corporation&#x27;s mathematics division. After a time at Lehigh University, he taught philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh starting in 1961. The orientalist Oskar Rescher is the first cousin of his father.

==Career==
Rescher began his career as an academic at Princeton University in 1951. He joined the philosophy department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1961, becoming the first associate director of its new Center for Philosophy of Science the following year. In 1964, he founded the &quot;American Philosophical Quarterly&quot;. From 1980 to 1981, Rescher served as the chairman of the philosophy department. In July 1988, Rescher changed roles at the Center for Philosophy of Science, resigning as its director and becoming its chairman. In 2010, he donated his philosophy collection to the Hillman Library.

An honorary member of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he was elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain, the Academia Europaea, the Royal Society of Canada, and the , among others.

Rescher was a prolific writer, with over 100 books and 400 articles, generating the jest that Rescher is not a single person, but a committee sharing the name. Philosopher Michele Marsonet, who has published extensively on Rescher&#x27;s philosophy, writes that his prolific publication is in itself the most common objection against Rescher, adding &quot;it is, indeed, a leitmotiv of all those unwilling to discuss his ideas&quot;. He is known for his system of pragmatic idealism, which synthesizes British idealism with the pragmatism of the U.S.

==Philosophy==
Rescher&#x27;s university biography describes his philosophical work thus:
His work envisions a dialectical tension between our synoptic aspirations for useful knowledge and our human limitations as finite inquirers. The elaboration of this project represents a many-sided approach to fundamental philosophical issues that weaves together threads of thought from the philosophy of science, and from continental idealism and American pragmatism.

In the mid and late 1960s, his studies were focused on medieval Arabic logic, but he soon broadened his areas of inquiry in metaphysics and epistemology, moving toward the methodological pragmatism he would define. In the 1970s, he began working more extensively with American pragmatism with a focus on the writings of C. S. Peirce, who was to number among his major influences. In 1966, Rescher collaborated with Herbert A. Simon on a ground-breaking paper on the theory of causality.

Rescher had contributed to futuristics, and with Olaf Helmer and , invented the Delphi method of forecasting. A lifelong aficionado of the philosophy of G. W. Leibniz, Rescher has been instrumental in the reconstruction of Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;machina deciphratoria&quot;, an ancestor of the famous Enigma cipher machine. Rescher was also responsible for two further items of historical rediscovery and reconstruction: the model of cosmic evolution in Anaximander, and the medieval Islamic theory of modal syllogistic.

==Honors==
Rescher was honored for his work. In 1984, he received the Humboldt Prize for Humanistic Scholarship. In 2005, he received the Cardinal Mercier Prize, and in 2007 the American Catholic Philosophical Society&#x27;s Aquinas Medal. In 2011, his contributions as a German-American to philosophy were recognized with the premier cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the American Metaphysical Society (2016), and the Helmholtz Medal of the German Academy of Sciences Berlin-Brandenburg. He holds eight honorary degrees. Having held visiting lectureships at Oxford, Konstanz, Salamanca, Munich, and Marburg, he has been awarded fellowships by the Ford, Guggenheim, and National Science Foundations. In April 2021, University of Tehran held a session in his honor where Nadia Maftouni asserted:
Rescher&#x27;s &quot;A Journey through Philosophy in 101 Anecdotes&quot; is a successful framework to reach a broader audience in the field. At first glance it seems an easy book to write. But at least in philosophy, it&#x27;s easy to write in a complicated style and it&#x27;s hard to write in a simple, clear, and readable fashion.

==Prize and medal==
In 2010, the University of Pittsburgh created the Dr. Nicholas Rescher Fund for the Advancement of the Department of Philosophy which bestows the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Contributions to Systematic Philosophy. The first recipient of the prize was Rescher&#x27;s former student, Ernest Sosa. As of 2012, the prize included a gold medal and $25,000, subsequently raised to $30,000. Later awardees have included Alvin Plantinga, Jürgen Mittelstraß, Hilary Putnam, Ruth Millikan, and Thomas Nagel. When the American Philosophical Association inaugurated its own Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy in 2018, the University of Pittsburgh redesignated its award as the Rescher Medal.

<text>A port scanner is an application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. Such an application may be used by administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify network services running on a host and exploit vulnerabilities.

A port scan or portscan is a process that sends client requests to a range of server port addresses on a host, with the goal of finding an active port; this is not a nefarious process in and of itself. The majority of uses of a port scan are not attacks, but rather simple probes to determine services available on a remote machine.

To portsweep is to scan multiple hosts for a specific listening port. The latter is typically used to search for a specific service, for example, an SQL-based computer worm may portsweep looking for hosts listening on TCP port 1433.

==TCP/IP basics==
The design and operation of the Internet is based on the Internet Protocol Suite, commonly also called TCP/IP. In this system, network services are referenced using two components: a host address and a port number. There are 65535 distinct and usable port numbers, numbered 1 … 65535. (Port zero is not a usable port number.) Most services use one, or at most a limited range of, port numbers.

Some port scanners scan only the most common port numbers, or ports most commonly associated with vulnerable services, on a given host.

The result of a scan on a port is usually generalized into one of three categories:
#&quot;Open&quot; or &quot;Accepted&quot;: The host sent a reply indicating that a service is listening on the port.
#&quot;Closed&quot; or &quot;Denied&quot; or &quot;Not Listening&quot;: The host sent a reply indicating that connections will be denied to the port.
#&quot;Filtered&quot;, &quot;Dropped&quot; or &quot;Blocked&quot;: There was no reply from the host.

Open ports present two vulnerabilities of which administrators must be wary:
#Security and stability concerns associated with the program responsible for delivering the service - Open ports.
#Security and stability concerns associated with the operating system that is running on the host - Open or Closed ports.

Filtered ports do not tend to present vulnerabilities.

==Assumptions==
All forms of port scanning rely on the assumption that the targeted host is compliant with RFC. Although this is the case most of the time, there is still a chance a host might send back strange packets or even generate false positives when the TCP/IP stack of the host is non-RFC-compliant or has been altered. This is especially true for less common scan techniques that are OS-dependent (FIN scanning, for example). The TCP/IP stack fingerprinting method also relies on these types of different network responses from a specific stimulus to guess the type of the operating system the host is running.

==Types of scans==

===TCP scanning===
The simplest port scanners use the operating system&#x27;s network functions and are generally the next option to go to when SYN is not a feasible option (described next). Nmap calls this mode connect scan, named after the Unix connect() system call. If a port is open, the operating system completes the TCP three-way handshake, and the port scanner immediately closes the connection to avoid performing a Denial-of-service attack. Otherwise an error code is returned. This scan mode has the advantage that the user does not require special privileges. However, using the OS network functions prevents low-level control, so this scan type is less common. This method is &quot;noisy&quot;, particularly if it is a &quot;portsweep&quot;: the services can log the sender IP address and Intrusion detection systems can raise an alarm.

===SYN scanning===
SYN scan is another form of TCP scanning. Rather than using the operating system&#x27;s network functions, the port scanner generates raw IP packets itself, and monitors for responses. This scan type is also known as &quot;half-open scanning&quot;, because it never actually opens a full TCP connection. The port scanner generates a SYN packet. If the target port is open, it will respond with a SYN-ACK packet. The scanner host responds with an RST packet, closing the connection before the handshake is completed. If the port is closed but unfiltered, the target will instantly respond with an RST packet.

The use of raw networking has several advantages, giving the scanner full control of the packets sent and the timeout for responses, and allowing detailed reporting of the responses. There is debate over which scan is less intrusive on the target host. SYN scan has the advantage that the individual services never actually receive a connection. However, the RST during the handshake can cause problems for some network stacks, in particular simple devices like printers. There are no conclusive arguments either way.

===UDP scanning===
UDP scanning is also possible, although there are technical challenges. UDP is a connectionless protocol so there is no equivalent to a TCP SYN packet. However, if a UDP packet is sent to a port that is not open, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message. Most UDP port scanners use this scanning method, and use the absence of a response to infer that a port is open. However, if a port is blocked by a firewall, this method will falsely report that the port is open. If the port unreachable message is blocked, all ports will appear open. This method is also affected by ICMP rate limiting.

An alternative approach is to send application-specific UDP packets, hoping to generate an application layer response. For example, sending a DNS query to port 53 will result in a response, if a DNS server is present. This method is much more reliable at identifying open ports. However, it is limited to scanning ports for which an application specific probe packet is available. Some tools (e.g., Nmap, Unionscan) generally have probes for less than 20 UDP services, while some commercial tools have as many as 70. In some cases, a service may be listening on the port, but configured not to respond to the particular probe packet.

===ACK scanning===
ACK scanning is one of the more unusual scan types, as it does not exactly determine whether the port is open or closed, but whether the port is filtered or unfiltered. This is especially good when attempting to probe for the existence of a firewall and its rulesets. Simple packet filtering will allow established connections (packets with the ACK bit set), whereas a more sophisticated stateful firewall might not.

===Window scanning===
Rarely used because of its outdated nature, window scanning is fairly untrustworthy in determining whether a port is opened or closed. It generates the same packet as an ACK scan, but checks whether the window field of the packet has been modified. When the packet reaches its destination, a design flaw attempts to create a window size for the packet if the port is open, flagging the window field of the packet with 1&#x27;s before it returns to the sender. Using this scanning technique with systems that no longer support this implementation returns 0&#x27;s for the window field, labeling open ports as closed.

===FIN scanning===
Since SYN scans are not surreptitious enough, firewalls are, in general, scanning for and blocking packets in the form of SYN packets. FIN packets can bypass firewalls without modification. Closed ports reply to a FIN packet with the appropriate RST packet, whereas open ports ignore the packet on hand. This is typical behavior due to the nature of TCP, and is in some ways an inescapable downfall.

===Other scan types===
Some more unusual scan types exist. These have various limitations and are not widely used. Nmap supports most of these.
* X-mas and Null Scan - are similar to FIN scanning, but:
** X-mas sends packets with FIN, URG and PUSH flags turned on like a Christmas tree
** Null sends a packet with no TCP flags set
*Protocol scan - determines what IP level protocols (TCP, UDP, GRE, etc.) are enabled.
*Proxy scan - a proxy (SOCKS or HTTP) is used to perform the scan. The target will see the proxy&#x27;s IP address as the source. This can also be done using some FTP servers.
*Idle scan - Another method of scanning without revealing one&#x27;s IP address, taking advantage of the predictable IP ID flaw.
*CatSCAN - Checks ports for erroneous packets.
*ICMP scan - determines if a host responds to ICMP requests, such as echo (ping), netmask, etc.

==Port filtering by ISPs==
Many Internet service providers restrict their customers&#x27; ability to perform port scans to destinations outside of their home networks. This is usually covered in the terms of service or acceptable use policy to which the customer must agree. Some ISPs implement packet filters or transparent proxies that prevent outgoing service requests to certain ports. For example, if an ISP provides a transparent HTTP proxy on port 80, port scans of any address will appear to have port 80 open, regardless of the target host&#x27;s actual configuration.

==Security==
The information gathered by a port scan has many legitimate uses including network inventory and the verification of the security of a network. Port scanning can, however, also be used to compromise security. Many exploits rely upon port scans to find open ports and send specific data patterns in an attempt to trigger a condition known as a buffer overflow. Such behavior can compromise the security of a network and the computers therein, resulting in the loss or exposure of sensitive information and the ability to do work.

The threat level caused by a port scan can vary greatly according to the method used to scan, the kind of port scanned, its number, the value of the targeted host and the administrator who monitors the host. But a port scan is often viewed as a first step for an attack, and is therefore taken seriously because it can disclose much sensitive information about the host.
Despite this, the probability of a port scan alone followed by a real attack is small. The probability of an attack is much higher when the port scan is associated with a vulnerability scan.

==Legal implications==
Because of the inherently open and decentralized architecture of the Internet, lawmakers have struggled since its creation to define legal boundaries that permit effective prosecution of cybercriminals. Cases involving port scanning activities are an example of the difficulties encountered in judging violations. Although these cases are rare, most of the time the legal process involves proving that an intent to commit a break-in or unauthorized access existed, rather than just the performance of a port scan.

In June 2003, an Israeli, Avi Mizrahi, was accused by the Israeli authorities of the offense of attempting the unauthorized access of computer material. He had port scanned the Mossad website. He was acquitted of all charges on February 29, 2004. The judge ruled that these kinds of actions should not be discouraged when they are performed in a positive way.

A 17-year-old Finn was accused of attempted computer break-in by a major Finnish bank. On April 9, 2003, he was convicted of the charge by the Supreme Court of Finland and ordered to pay US$12,000 for the expense of the forensic analysis made by the bank. In 1998, he had port scanned the bank network in an attempt to access the closed network, but failed to do so.

In 2006, the UK Parliament had voted an amendment to the Computer Misuse Act 1990 such that a person is guilty of an offence who &quot;makes, adapts, supplies or offers to supply any article knowing that it is designed or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with an offence under section 1 or 3 [of the CMA]&quot;. Nevertheless, the area of effect of this amendment is blurred, and widely criticized by Security experts as such.

Germany, with the Strafgesetzbuch § 202a,b,c also has a similar law, and the Council of the European Union has issued a press release stating they plan to pass a similar one too, albeit more precise.

===United States===
====&quot;Moulton v. VC3&quot;====
In December 1999, Scott Moulton was arrested by the FBI and accused of attempted computer trespassing under Georgia&#x27;s Computer Systems Protection Act and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of America. At this time, his IT service company had an ongoing contract with Cherokee County of Georgia to maintain and upgrade the 911 center security. He performed several port scans on Cherokee County servers to check their security and eventually port scanned a web server monitored by another IT company, provoking a tiff which ended up in a tribunal. He was acquitted in 2000, with judge Thomas Thrash ruling in &quot;Moulton v. VC3&quot; (N.D.Ga. 2000) that there was no damage impairing the integrity and availability of the network.

<doc id="576640" wikidata="Q8082045" url="?curid=576640" title="Śrāvakayāna">
<text>Śrāvakayāna (; ; ) is one of the three &quot;yānas&quot; known to Indian Buddhism. It translates literally as the &quot;vehicle of listeners [i.e. disciples]&quot;. Historically it was the most common term used by Mahāyāna Buddhist texts to describe one hypothetical path to enlightenment. Śrāvakayāna is the path that meets the goals of an Arhat—an individual who achieves liberation as a result of listening to the teachings (or following a lineage) of a Samyaksaṃbuddha. A Buddha who achieved enlightenment through &quot;Śrāvakayāna&quot; is called a &quot;Śrāvakabuddha&quot;, as distinguished from a Samyaksaṃbuddha or pratyekabuddha. 

==Use of the term==

Isabelle Onians asserts that although &quot;the Mahāyāna ... very occasionally referred contemptuously to earlier Buddhism as the Hinayāna, the Inferior Way,&quot; &quot;the preponderance of this name in the secondary literature is far out of proportion to occurrences in the Indian texts.&quot; She notes that the term Śrāvakayāna was &quot;the more politically correct and much more usual&quot; term used by Mahāyānists. &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; (the &quot;lesser vehicle&quot;), however, was used to include both Śrāvakayāna and Pratyekabuddhayāna in contrast to the Mahāyāna.

==In Early Buddhist schools==
At least some of the early Buddhist schools used the concept of three vehicles including Śrāvakayāna. For example, the Vaibhāṣika Sarvāstivādins are known to have employed the outlook of Buddhist practice as consisting of the Three Vehicles:

# Śrāvakayāna
# Pratyekabuddhayāna
# Bodhisattvayāna

The Dharmaguptakas regarded the path of a śrāvaka (&quot;śrāvakayāna&quot;) and the path of a bodhisattva (&quot;bodhisattvayāna&quot;) to be separate. One of their tenets reads, &quot;The Buddha and those of the Two Vehicles, although they have one and the same liberation, have followed different noble paths.&quot;

==In Mahāyāna traditions==
In the 4th century Mahāyāna abhidharma work &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya&quot;, Asaṅga describes those who follow the Śrāvaka Vehicle (Skt. &quot;śrāvakayanika&quot;). These people are described as having weak faculties, following the Śrāvaka Dharma, utilizing the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, being set on their own liberation, and cultivating detachment in order to attain liberation. While those in the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle (Skt. &quot;pratyekabuddhayānika&quot;) are portrayed as also utilizing the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, they are said to have medium faculties, to follow the Pratyekabuddha Dharma, and to be set on their own personal enlightenment. Finally, those in the Mahāyāna (Skt. &quot;mahāyānika&quot;) are portrayed as utilizing the Bodhisattva Piṭaka, as having sharp faculties, following the Bodhisattva Dharma, and set on the perfection and liberation of all beings, and the attainment of complete enlightenment.

===In Tibetan Buddhism===
In the work written by Gampopa (1074-1153 C.E.), &quot;The Jewel Ornament of Liberation, The Wish-fulfilling Gem of the Noble Teachings&quot;, the ‘Pratyekabuddha family’ are described as those who fear samsara and yearn to reach nirvana, but have little compassionate activity, benefiting other beings. 

They cling to the idea that the unsullied meditative absorption they experience is Nirvana, when it&#x27;s more like an island to find rest on the way to their actual goal. Rather than feel discouraged, the Buddha taught the &quot;Śravakabuddha&quot; and &quot;Pratyekabuddha&quot; paths for rest and recuperation. After finding rest, they are encouraged and awakened by the Buddha&#x27;s body speech and mind to reach final Nirvana. Inspired by the Buddha, they then cultivate Bodhicitta and practice the Bodhisattva path.

==In Theravāda traditions==
===&quot;Sāvakabuddha&quot;===
Sāvakabuddha is a Pali term (equivalent to Sanskrit: ), used rarely in Theravada Buddhism, to refer to an enlightened disciple of a Buddha. &quot;Sāvaka&quot; means &quot;one who hears&quot;; a person who follows the path to enlightenment by means of hearing the instructions of others. Lay persons, who take special vows, are called &quot;sāvaka&quot;s. Such enlightened disciples obtained  by hearing the dhamma as initially taught by a sammasambuddha. A Sāvakabuddha is distinguished from a Sammasambuddha and a Paccekabuddha. The standard designation for such a person is &quot;arhat&quot;.

Buddhas are supposed to reach by their own efforts and insights. A &quot;Sāvakabuddha&quot; might also lead others to enlightenment, but cannot teach the dhamma in a time or world where it has been forgotten, because they depend upon a tradition that stretches back to a &quot;Sammasambuddha&quot;.

The term &quot;Sāvakabuddha&quot; is used in Theravadin commentaries but does not occur in the scriptures of the Pāli Canon.

<text>Victoria Land is a region in eastern Antarctica which fronts the western side of the Ross Sea and the Ross Ice Shelf, extending southward from about 70°30&#x27;S to 78°00&#x27;S, and westward from the Ross Sea to the edge of the Antarctic Plateau. It was discovered by Captain James Clark Ross in January 1841 and named after Queen Victoria. The rocky promontory of Minna Bluff is often regarded as the southernmost point of Victoria Land, and separates the Scott Coast to the north from the Hillary Coast of the Ross Dependency to the south. 

== History ==
Early explorers of Victoria Land include James Clark Ross and Douglas Mawson.

In 1979, scientists discovered a group of 309 meteorites in Antarctica, some of which were found near the Allan Hills in Victoria Land. The meteorites appeared to have undergone little change since they were formed at what scientists believe was the birth of the Solar System.

In 1981, lichens found at Victoria Land attracted the attention of NASA because lichens may give clues about where to look for the existence of extraterrestrial life. Dr. George Denton, a glaciologist at the University of New Hampshire, looked for microorganisms on Mount Lister, one of the highest in Antarctica; it has the same kind of sandstone in which lichens grow.

In 2017, conservationists at Cape Adare, Victoria Land, unearthed an ice-covered fruitcake that they believe once belonged to the British explorer Robert Falcon Scott. Scott&#x27;s Northern Party expedition was in 1911, making the age of the fruitcake 106 years old. A program manager said it was in &quot;excellent condition.&quot;

== Geography ==
The region includes ranges of the Transantarctic Mountains and the McMurdo Dry Valleys (the highest point being Mount Abbott in the Northern Foothills), and the flatlands known as the Labyrinth. The Mount Melbourne is an active volcano in Victoria Land.

<doc id="576646" wikidata="Q222947" url="?curid=576646" title="2.5D">
<text>2.5D (basic pronunciation two-and-a-half dimensional) perspective refers to gameplay or movement in a video game or virtual reality environment that is restricted to a two-dimensional (2D) plane with little to no access to a third dimension in a space that otherwise &quot;appears&quot; to be three-dimensional and is often simulated and rendered in a 3D digital environment.

This is similar but different from pseudo-3D perspective (sometimes called three-quarter view when the environment is portrayed from an angled top-down perspective), which refers to 2D graphical projections and similar techniques used to cause images or scenes to simulate the appearance of being three-dimensional (3D) when in fact they are not.

By contrast, games, spaces or perspectives that are simulated and rendered in 3D and used in 3D level design are said to be &quot;true 3D,&quot; and 2D rendered games made to appear as 2D without approximating a 3D image are said to be &quot;true 2D&quot;.

Common in video games, 2.5D projections have also been useful in geographic visualization (GVIS) to help understand visual-cognitive spatial representations or 3D visualization.

The terms &quot;three-quarter perspective&quot; and &quot;three-quarter view&quot; trace their origins to the three-quarter profile in portraiture and facial recognition, which depicts a person&#x27;s face that is partway between a frontal view and a side view.

==Computer graphics==

===Axonometric and oblique projection===

In axonometric projection and oblique projection, two forms of parallel projection, the viewpoint is rotated slightly to reveal other facets of the environment than what are visible in a top-down perspective or side view, thereby producing a three-dimensional effect. An object is &quot;considered to be in an inclined position resulting in foreshortening of all three axes&quot;, and the image is a &quot;representation on a single plane (as a drawing surface) of a three-dimensional object placed at an angle to the plane of projection.&quot; Lines perpendicular to the plane become points, lines parallel to the plane have true length, and lines inclined to the plane are foreshortened.

They are popular camera perspectives among 2D video games, most commonly those released for 16-bit or earlier and handheld consoles, as well as in later strategy and role-playing video games. The advantage of these perspectives is that they combine the visibility and mobility of a top-down game with the character recognizability of a side-scrolling game. Thus the player can be presented an overview of the game world in the ability to see it from above, more or less, and with additional details in artwork made possible by using an angle: Instead of showing a humanoid in top-down perspective, as a head and shoulders seen from above, the entire body can be drawn when using a slanted angle; turning a character around would reveal how it looks from the sides, the front and the back, while the top-down perspective will display the same head and shoulders regardless.
There are three main divisions of axonometric projection: &quot;isometric&quot; (equal measure), &quot;dimetric&quot; (symmetrical and unsymmetrical), and &quot;trimetric&quot; (single-view or only two sides). The most common of these drawing types in engineering drawing is isometric projection. This projection is tilted so that all three axes create equal angles at intervals of 120 degrees. The result is that all three axes are equally foreshortened. In video games, a form of dimetric projection with a 2:1 pixel ratio is more common due to the problems of anti-aliasing and square pixels found on most computer monitors.

In oblique projection typically all three axes are shown without foreshortening. All lines parallel to the axes are drawn to scale, and diagonals and curved lines are distorted. One tell-tale sign of oblique projection is that the face pointed toward the camera retains its right angles with respect to the image plane.

Two examples of oblique projection are &quot;Ultima VII: The Black Gate&quot; and &quot;Paperboy&quot;. Examples of axonometric projection include &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, and the role-playing games &quot;Diablo&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

===Billboarding===
In three-dimensional scenes, the term billboarding is applied to a technique in which objects are sometimes represented by two-dimensional images applied to a single polygon which is typically kept perpendicular to the line of sight. The name refers to the fact that objects are seen as if drawn on a billboard. This technique was commonly used in early 1990s video games when consoles did not have the hardware power to render fully 3D objects. This is also known as a backdrop. This can be used to good effect for a significant performance boost when the geometry is sufficiently distant that it can be seamlessly replaced with a 2D sprite. In games, this technique is most frequently applied to objects such as particles (smoke, sparks, rain) and low-detail vegetation. It has since become mainstream, and is found in many games such as &quot;&quot;, where it is exploited to simultaneously display thousands of individual soldiers on a battlefield. Early examples include early first-person shooters like &quot;Marathon Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; as well as racing games like &quot;Carmageddon&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; and platformers like &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

===Skyboxes and skydomes===

Skyboxes and skydomes are methods used to easily create a background to make a game level look bigger than it really is. If the level is enclosed in a cube, the sky, distant mountains, distant buildings, and other unreachable objects are rendered onto the cube&#x27;s faces using a technique called cube mapping, thus creating the illusion of distant three-dimensional surroundings. A &quot;skydome&quot; employs the same concept but uses a sphere or hemisphere instead of a cube.

As a viewer moves through a 3D scene, it is common for the skybox or skydome to remain stationary with respect to the viewer. This technique gives the skybox the illusion of being very far away since other objects in the scene appear to move, while the skybox does not. This imitates real life, where distant objects such as clouds, stars and even mountains appear to be stationary when the viewpoint is displaced by relatively small distances. Effectively, everything in a skybox will always appear to be infinitely distant from the viewer. This consequence of skyboxes dictates that designers should be careful not to carelessly include images of discrete objects in the textures of a skybox since the viewer may be able to perceive the inconsistencies of those objects&#x27; sizes as the scene is traversed.

===Scaling along the Z axis===
In some games, sprites are scaled larger or smaller depending on its distance to the player, producing the illusion of motion along the Z (forward) axis. Sega&#x27;s 1986 video game &quot;Out Run&quot;, which runs on the Sega OutRun arcade system board, is a good example of this technique.

In &quot;Out Run&quot;, the player drives a Ferrari into depth of the game window. The palms on the left and right side of the street are the same bitmap, but have been scaled to different sizes, creating the illusion that some are closer than others. The angles of movement are &quot;left and right&quot; and &quot;into the depth&quot; (while still capable of doing so technically, this game did not allow making a U-turn or going into reverse, therefore moving &quot;out of the depth&quot;, as this did not make sense to the high-speed game play and tense time limit). Notice the view is comparable to that which a driver would have in reality when driving a car. The position and size of any billboard is generated by a (complete 3D) perspective transformation as are the vertices of the poly-line representing the center of the street. Often the center of the street is stored as a spline and sampled in a way that on straight streets every sampling point corresponds to one scan-line on the screen. Hills and curves lead to multiple points on one line and one has to be chosen. Or one line is without any point and has to be interpolated lineary from the adjacent lines. Very memory intensive billboards are used in &quot;Out Run&quot; to draw corn-fields and water waves which are wider than the screen even at the largest viewing distance and also in &quot;Test Drive&quot; to draw trees and cliffs.

&quot;Drakkhen&quot; was notable for being among the first role-playing video games to feature a three-dimensional playing field. However, it did not employ a conventional 3D game engine, instead emulating one using character-scaling algorithms. The player&#x27;s party travels overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed. &quot;Drakkhen&quot; features an animated day-night cycle, and the ability to wander freely about the game world, both rarities for a game of its era. This type of engine was later used in the game &quot;Eternam&quot;.

Some mobile games that were released on the Java ME platform, such as the mobile version of Asphalt: Urban GT and , used this method for rendering the scenery. While the technique is similar to some of Sega&#x27;s arcade games, such as Thunder Blade and Cool Riders and the 32-bit version of Road Rash, it uses polygons instead of sprite scaling for buildings and certain objects though it looks flat shaded. Later mobile games (mainly from Gameloft), such as Asphalt 4: Elite Racing and the mobile version of Iron Man 2, uses a mix of sprite scaling and texture mapping for some buildings and objects.

===Parallax scrolling===
Parallaxing refers to when a collection of 2D sprites or layers of sprites are made to move independently of each other and/or the background to create a sense of added depth. This depth cue is created by relative motion of layers. The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1940s. This type of graphical effect was first used in the 1982 arcade game &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;.
Examples include the skies in &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;, the arcade version of &quot;Rygar&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as &quot;Super Mario World&quot;.

===Mode 7===

Mode 7, a display system effect that included rotation and scaling, allowed for a 3D effect while moving in any direction without any actual 3D models, and was used to simulate 3D graphics on the SNES.

===Ray casting===
Ray casting is a first person pseudo-3D technique in which a ray for every vertical slice of the screen is sent from the position of the camera. These rays shoot out until they hit an object or wall, and that part of the wall is rendered in that vertical screen slice. Due to the limited camera movement and internally 2D playing field, this is often considered 2.5D.

===Bump, normal and parallax mapping===

Bump mapping, normal mapping and parallax mapping are techniques applied to textures in 3D rendering applications such as video games to simulate bumps and wrinkles on the surface of an object without using more polygons. To the end user, this means that textures such as stone walls will have more apparent depth and thus greater realism with less of an influence on the performance of the simulation.

Bump mapping is achieved by perturbing the surface normals of an object and using a grayscale image and the perturbed normal during illumination calculations. The result is an apparently bumpy surface rather than a perfectly smooth surface although the surface of the underlying object is not actually changed. Bump mapping was introduced by Blinn in 1978.

In normal mapping, the unit vector from the shading point to the light source is dotted with the unit vector normal to that surface, and the dot product is the intensity of the light on that surface. Imagine a polygonal model of a sphere—you can only approximate the shape of the surface. By using a 3-channel bitmapped image textured across the model, more detailed normal vector information can be encoded. Each channel in the bitmap corresponds to a spatial dimension (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;). These spatial dimensions are relative to a constant coordinate system for object-space normal maps, or to a smoothly varying coordinate system (based on the derivatives of position with respect to texture coordinates) in the case of tangent-space normal maps. This adds much more detail to the surface of a model, especially in conjunction with advanced lighting techniques.

Parallax mapping (also called offset mapping or virtual displacement mapping) is an enhancement of the bump mapping and normal mapping techniques implemented by displacing the texture coordinates at a point on the rendered polygon by a function of the view angle in tangent space (the angle relative to the surface normal) and the value of the height map at that point. At steeper view-angles, the texture coordinates are displaced more, giving the illusion of depth due to parallax effects as the view changes.

== Film and animation techniques ==
The term is also used to describe an animation effect commonly used in music videos and, more frequently, title sequences. Brought to wide attention by the motion picture &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture&quot;, an adaptation of film producer Robert Evans&#x27;s memoir, it involves the layering and animating of two-dimensional pictures in three-dimensional space. Earlier examples of this technique include Liz Phair&#x27;s music video &quot;Down&quot; (directed by Rodney Ascher) and &quot;A Special Tree&quot; (directed by musician Giorgio Moroder).

On a larger scale, the 2018 movie &quot;In Saturn&#x27;s Rings&quot; used over 7.5 million separate two-dimensional images, captured in space or by telescopes, which were composited and moved using multi-plane animation techniques.

==Graphic design==
The term also refers to an often-used effect in the design of icons and graphical user interfaces (GUIs), where a slight 3D illusion is created by the presence of a virtual light source to the left (or in some cases right) side, and above a person&#x27;s computer monitor. The light source itself is always invisible, but its effects are seen in the lighter colors for the top and left side, simulating reflection, and the darker colours to the right and below of such objects, simulating shadow.

An advanced version of this technique can be found in some specialised graphic design software, such as Pixologic&#x27;s ZBrush. The idea is that the program&#x27;s canvas represents a normal 2D painting surface, but that the data structure that holds the pixel information is also able to store information with respect to a z-index, as well material settings, specularity, etc. Again, with this data it is thus possible to simulate lighting, shadows, and so forth.

==History==
The first video games that used pseudo-3D were primarily arcade games, the earliest known examples dating back to the mid-1970s, when they began using microprocessors. In 1975, Taito released &quot;Interceptor&quot;, an early first-person shooter and combat flight simulator that involved piloting a jet fighter, using an eight-way joystick to aim with a crosshair and shoot at enemy aircraft that move in formations of two and increase/decrease in size depending on their distance to the player. In 1976, Sega released &quot;Moto-Cross&quot;, an early black-and-white motorbike racing video game, based on the motocross competition, that was most notable for introducing an early three-dimensional third-person perspective. Later that year, Sega-Gremlin re-branded the game as &quot;Fonz&quot;, as a tie-in for the popular sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Both versions of the game displayed a constantly changing forward-scrolling road and the player&#x27;s bike in a third-person perspective where objects nearer to the player are larger than those nearer to the horizon, and the aim was to steer the vehicle across the road, racing against the clock, while avoiding any on-coming motorcycles or driving off the road. That same year also saw the release of two arcade games that extended the car driving subgenre into three dimensions with a first-person perspective: Sega&#x27;s &quot;Road Race&quot;, which displayed a constantly changing forward-scrolling S-shaped road with two obstacle race cars moving along the road that the player must avoid crashing while racing against the clock, and Atari&#x27;s &quot;Night Driver&quot;, which presented a series of posts by the edge of the road though there was no view of the road or the player&#x27;s car. Games using vector graphics had an advantage in creating pseudo-3D effects. 1979&#x27;s &quot;Speed Freak&quot; recreated the perspective of &quot;Night Driver&quot; in greater detail.

In 1979, Nintendo debuted &quot;Radar Scope&quot;, a shoot &#x27;em up that introduced a three-dimensional third-person perspective to the genre, imitated years later by shooters such as Konami&#x27;s &quot;Juno First&quot; and Activision&#x27;s &quot;Beamrider&quot;. In 1980, Atari&#x27;s &quot;Battlezone&quot; was a breakthrough for pseudo-3D gaming, recreating a 3D perspective with unprecedented realism, though the gameplay was still planar. It was followed up that same year by &quot;Red Baron&quot;, which used scaling vector images to create a forward scrolling rail shooter.

Sega&#x27;s arcade shooter &quot;Space Tactics&quot;, released in 1980, allowed players to take aim using crosshairs and shoot lasers into the screen at enemies coming towards them, creating an early 3D effect. It was followed by other arcade shooters with a first-person perspective during the early 1980s, including Taito&#x27;s 1981 release &quot;Space Seeker&quot;, and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 1982. Sega&#x27;s &quot;SubRoc-3D&quot; in 1982 also featured a first-person perspective and introduced the use of stereoscopic 3-D through a special eyepiece. Sega&#x27;s &quot;Astron Belt&quot; in 1983 was the first laserdisc video game, using full-motion video to display the graphics from a first-person perspective. Third-person rail shooters were also released in arcades at the time, including Sega&#x27;s &quot;Tac/Scan&quot; in 1982, Nippon&#x27;s &quot;Ambush&quot; in 1983, Nichibutsu&#x27;s &quot;Tube Panic&quot; in 1983, and Sega&#x27;s 1982 release &quot;Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom&quot;, notable for its fast pseudo-3D scaling and detailed sprites.

In 1981, Sega&#x27;s &quot;Turbo&quot; was the first racing game to use sprite scaling with full-colour graphics. &quot;Pole Position&quot; by Namco is one of the first racing games to use the trailing camera effect that is now so familiar . In this particular example, the effect was produced by linescroll—the practice of scrolling each line independently in order to warp an image. In this case, the warping would simulate curves and steering. To make the road appear to move towards the player, per-line color changes were used, though many console versions opted for palette animation instead.

&quot;Zaxxon&quot;, a shooter introduced by Sega in 1982, was the first game to use isometric axonometric projection, from which its name is derived. Though Zaxxon&#x27;s playing field is semantically 3D, the game has many constraints which classify it as 2.5D: a fixed point of view, scene composition from sprites, and movements such as bullet shots restricted to straight lines along the axes. It was also one of the first video games to display shadows. The following year, Sega released the first pseudo-3D isometric platformer, &quot;Congo Bongo&quot;. Another early pseudo-3D platform game released that year was Konami&#x27;s &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot;, where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling third-person perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles. It was one of the earliest pseudo-3D games available on a computer, released for the MSX in 1983. That same year, Irem&#x27;s &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; was a side-scrolling run &amp; gun platform-shooter that introduced the use of layered parallax scrolling to give a pseudo-3D effect. In 1985, &quot;Space Harrier&quot; introduced Sega&#x27;s &quot;Super Scaler&quot; technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them.

The first original home console game to use pseudo-3D, and also the first to use multiple camera angles mirrored on television sports broadcasts, was &quot;Intellivision World Series Baseball&quot; (1983) by Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower, published by Mattel. Its television sports style of display was later adopted by 3D sports games and is now used by virtually all major team sports titles. In 1984, Sega ported several pseudo-3D arcade games to the Sega SG-1000 console, including a smooth conversion of the third-person pseudo-3D rail shooter &quot;Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom&quot;.

By 1989, 2.5D representations were surfaces drawn with depth cues and a part of graphic libraries like GINO. 2.5D was also used in terrain modeling with software packages such as ISM from Dynamic Graphics, GEOPAK from Uniras and the Intergraph DTM system. 2.5D surface techniques gained popularity within the geography community because of its ability to visualize the normal thickness to area ratio used in many geographic models; this ratio was very small and reflected the thinness of the object in relation to its width, which made it the object realistic in a specific plane. These representations were axiomatic in that the entire subsurface domain was not used or the entire domain could not be reconstructed; therefore, it used only a surface and a surface is one aspect not the full 3D identity.

The specific term &quot;two-and-a-half-D&quot; was used as early as 1994 by Warren Spector in an interview in the North American premiere issue of PC Gamer magazine. At the time, the term was understood to refer specifically to first-person shooters like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, to distinguish them from System Shock&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; 3D engine.

With the advent of consoles and computer systems that were able to handle several thousand polygons (the most basic element of &quot;3D computer graphics&quot;) per second and the usage of 3D specialized graphics processing units, pseudo-3D became obsolete. But even today, there are computer systems in production, such as cellphones, which are often not powerful enough to display &quot;true&quot; 3D graphics, and therefore use pseudo-3D for that purpose. Many games from the 1980s&#x27; &quot;pseudo-3D arcade era&quot; and &quot;16-bit console era&quot; are ported to these systems, giving the manufacturers the possibility to earn revenues from games that are several decades old.
The resurgence of 2.5D or visual analysis, in natural and earth science, has increased the role of computer systems in the creation of spatial information in mapping. GVIS has made real the search for unknowns, real-time interaction with spatial data, and control over map display and has paid particular attention to three-dimensional representations. Efforts in GVIS have attempted to expand higher dimensions and make them more visible; most efforts have focused on &quot;tricking&quot; vision into seeing three dimensions in a 2D plane. Much like 2.5D displays where the surface of a three-dimensional object is represented but locations within the solid are distorted or not accessible.

==Technical aspects and generalizations==
The reason for using pseudo-3D instead of &quot;real&quot; 3D computer graphics is that the system that has to simulate a 3D-looking graphic is not powerful enough to handle the calculation-intensive routines of 3D computer graphics, yet is capable of using tricks of modifying 2D graphics like bitmaps. One of these tricks is to stretch a bitmap more and more, therefore making it larger with each step, as to give the effect of an object coming closer and closer towards the player.

Even simple shading and size of an image could be considered pseudo-3D, as shading makes it look more realistic. If the light in a 2D game were 2D, it would only be visible on the outline, and because outlines are often dark, they would not be very clearly visible. However, any visible shading would indicate the usage of pseudo-3D lighting and that the image uses pseudo-3D graphics. Changing the size of an image can cause the image to appear to be moving closer or further away, which could be considered simulating a third dimension.

Dimensions are the variables of the data and can be mapped to specific locations in space; 2D data can be given 3D volume by adding a value to the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z&quot; plane. &quot;Assigning height to 2D regions of a topographic map&quot; associating every 2D location with a height/elevation value creates a 2.5D projection; this is not considered a &quot;true 3D representation&quot;, however is used like 3D visual representation to &quot;simplify visual processing of imagery and the resulting spatial cognition&quot;.

<text>Alston&#x27;s mouse opossum (Marmosa alstoni), also known as Alston&#x27;s opossum, is a medium-sized pouchless marsupial of the family Didelphidae. It is arboreal and nocturnal, inhabiting forests from Belize to northern Colombia. The main components of its diet are insects and fruits, but it may also eat small rodents, lizards, and bird eggs. It was formerly assigned to the genus &quot;Micoureus&quot;, which was made a subgenus of &quot;Marmosa&quot; in 2009.

<doc id="576657" wikidata="Q1568903" url="?curid=576657" title="Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant">
<text>The Harris Nuclear Plant is a nuclear power plant with a single Westinghouse designed pressurized-water nuclear reactor operated by Duke Energy. It was named in honor of W. Shearon Harris, former president of Carolina Power &amp; Light (predecessor of Progress Energy Inc.). Located in New Hill, North Carolina, in the United States, about 20 miles (30 km) southwest of Raleigh, it generates 900 MWe, uses a 523-foot (160 m) natural draft cooling tower for cooling, and uses Harris Lake for cooling tower makeup, shutdown and emergency cooling. The reactor achieved criticality in January 1987 and began providing power commercially on May 2 of that year.

The Shearon Harris site was originally designed for four reactors (and still has the space available for them), but only one was built. The final cost approached $3.9B, including safety upgrades mandated after the Three Mile Island accident.

On November 16, 2006, the operator applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a renewal and extension of the plant&#x27;s operating license.
The NRC granted the renewal on December 17, 2008, extending the license from forty years to sixty.

== Refurbished generator from Three Mile Island ==
On January 22, 2010, officials at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced the electrical generator from the damaged Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island would be used at Shearon Harris. The generator was refurbished and installed during a refueling outage in November, 2010.

== Units 2 &amp; 3 ==
On February 19, 2008 Progress filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL). It seeks to build two 1,100 MWe Westinghouse AP1000 pressurized water reactors. Although the NRC had already certified the AP1000 design, the application review was expected to take about 36 months. The new reactors would not be operational before 2018.

Expansion of the plant would require raising the water level of Harris Lake by 20 feet, decreasing the size of Wake County&#x27;s largest park, with the Cape Fear River as a backup water source.

On May 2, 2013, Duke submitted a request to the NRC to suspend review of the Harris Units 2 and 3 Combined License Application (COLA), effectively halting further development of this project. Duke has determined the forecast operating dates of the proposed reactors falls outside the fifteen-year planning horizon utilized by state regulators in their demonstration of need evaluation. The COLA remains docketed, however, leaving the door open for Duke to restart activities.

== Electricity production ==
== Reactor data ==
The Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant consists of one operational reactor. Three additional units were cancelled. Two additional reactors were planned and cancelled in 2013.
==Safety==

===Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspections===
As of September 2017, the Harris plant is one of three out of the 99 plants in the country to have no Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) findings during the past 4 quarters of inspections.

The NRC&#x27;s risk estimate for an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Shearon Harris was 1 in 434,783, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.

===Surrounding population===
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.

The 2010 U.S. population within of Shearon Harris was 96,401, an increase of 62.6 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 2,562,573, an increase of 26.0 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Raleigh (21 miles to city center), Durham (24 miles to city center), and Fayetteville (39 miles to city center).

During FEMA&#x27;s most recent evaluation of state and local government&#x27;s plans and preparedness included emergency operations for the plant, no deficiencies or areas requiring corrective actions were identified.

=== NC-WARN concerns ===
The anti-nuclear group &quot;N.C. Waste Awareness and Reduction Network&quot; (NC-WARN) questioned the facility&#x27;s safety and security record calling it &quot;insufficient&quot; and claiming &quot;it is the most dangerous nuclear plant in the US&quot;. However, the plant&#x27;s technical and security systems have passed all Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) standards , including protection and security, and no worker or area resident has been injured as a result of the plant&#x27;s operation.

=== Spent fuel pools ===
In 2010, Project Censored, a non-profit, investigative journalism project, ranked the safety issues at Shearon Harris the 4th most under-reported story of the year, because of the risk of fires at what are the largest spent-fuel pools in the country.

In August 2007, NC WARN dropped a lawsuit against Progress Energy that was intended to delay or prevent expansion of Shearon Harris, claiming that continuing the legal battle would cost at least $200,000.

== Shutdown ==

On May 16, 2013, Shearon Harris Unit 1 initiated an unplanned shutdown when reviews of ultrasonic data from a refueling outage in spring 2012 determined a 1/4&quot; flaw was inside the 6&quot;-thick Reactor Pressure Vessel Head. The flaw was near the nozzle for a control rod drive mechanism and attributed to primary water stress corrosion cracking, though no actual leakage was detected. Due to high radiation levels, the repairs required robotic aid. A brand new reactor vessel head was installed November 2019.

He held the office of Third Secretary in the Diplomatic Service between 1910 and 1917, and the office of Second Secretary in the Diplomatic Service between 1917 and 1919. He was invested as a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1921, and as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1935, and was Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works of Art, 1936–43. He gained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1939 in the service of the Grenadier Guards. He fought in the Second World War between 1939 and 1945. His diplomatic skills proved invaluable in dealing with the Allies.

As a somewhat elderly officer with a spinsterish manner, he earned the nickname&quot; &#x27;The Iron Duchess.&quot;&#x27; Simon Heffer, Editor of Chips Channon&#x27;s diaries Volume 3 in 2022, records that the nickname was devised by Army colleagues as he was gay. 

In 1943, he succeeded his nephew, Henry, as Duke of Wellington, Earl of Mornington, and Prince of Waterloo. His nephew&#x27;s other title, Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo, passed to Henry&#x27;s sister (his niece) Lady Anne Rhys, before she ceded it to him in 1949. He served as Lord Lieutenant of the County of London between 1944 and 1949 and as Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire between 1949 and 1960. In 1951, he was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter.

In 1953 he became the first Chancellor of the University of Southampton.

==Architecture projects==
Among his architecture projects was the remodelling of 5 Belgrave Square, the London home of Henry &quot;Chips&quot; Channon, an Anglo-American member of Parliament, and of Channon&#x27;s country house, Kelvedon Hall in Essex. Working with Trenwith Wills, Wellesley also remodeled Castle Hill, Filleigh, in Devon; Hinton Ampner in Hampshire; and Biddick Hall in County Durham and St Mary and St George Church, High Wycombe. Wellesley also designed the Faringdon Folly tower for Lord Berners and built Portland House in Weymouth in 1935.

==Books==
He was the author of the following books :
*&quot;The Iconography of the First Duke of Wellington&quot; (1935)
*&quot;The Diary of a Desert Journey&quot; (1938)
*&quot;The Journal of Mrs. Arbuthnot&quot; (1950)
*&quot;A Selection from the Private Correspondence of the First Duke of Wellington&quot; (1952)

==Wellington Museum==
In 1947 the Duke gave Apsley House and its important contents (Wellington Collection) to the nation with Wellington Museum Act (but retained the right to occupy a large portion for him and his family)

==Family==
On 30 April 1914, Wellesley married Dorothy Violet Ashton (30 July 1889 – 11 July 1956). The Ashtons were an affluent cotton mill owning family, and Dorothy&#x27;s father, Robert Ashton of Croughton, Cheshire was a second cousin of Thomas Gair Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde). Dorothy&#x27;s mother was (Lucy) Cecilia Dunn-Gardner, who later became Countess of Scarbrough after marrying Aldred Lumley, 10th Earl of Scarbrough in 1899. Wellesley and Dorothy had two children:
*Valerian Wellesley, 8th Duke of Wellington (2 July 1915 – 31 December 2014)
*Lady Elizabeth Wellesley (26 December 1918 – 25 November 2013), mother of the actor and musician Jeremy Clyde.

The marriage was unhappy and they separated in 1922, but never divorced. Dorothy, a poet, was a lesbian. She became the lover of Vita Sackville-West, (who wrote her entry for the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;). before becoming the lover and long-time companion of Hilda Matheson, a prominent BBC producer. Interestingly, Wellesley had been engaged to Sackville-West&#x27;s former lover Violet Trefusis before marrying Dorothy. Wellesley himself was rumoured to be bisexual or homosexual, but this belief stems largely from certain effeminate mannerisms, and there is no record of any male lover.

After his wife&#x27;s death in 1956, Wellesley reportedly wished to marry his widowed sister-in-law, Lady Serena James, but she did not wish to leave her marital home.

Wellesley died early in 1972. His probate was sworn in the year of his death at . He was succeeded in his titles and estates by his only son, Valerian.
