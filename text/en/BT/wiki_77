<text>James Joseph &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger Jr. (; September 3, 1929 – October 30, 2018) was an American organized crime boss who led the Winter Hill Gang, an Irish Mob group based in the Winter Hill neighborhood of Somerville, Massachusetts, northwest of Boston. On December 23, 1994, Bulger went into hiding after his former FBI handler, John Connolly, tipped him off about a pending RICO indictment against him. He remained at large for sixteen years. After his 2011 arrest, federal prosecutors tried Bulger for nineteen murders based on grand jury testimony from Kevin Weeks and other former criminal associates.

Although he adamantly denied it, the FBI stated that Bulger had served as an informant for several years starting in 1975, providing information about the inner workings of the Patriarca crime family, his Italian-American Mafia rivals based in Boston and Providence, Rhode Island. In return, Connolly, as Bulger&#x27;s FBI handler, ensured that the Winter Hill Gang was effectively ignored. Beginning in 1997, press reports exposed various instances of criminal misconduct by federal, state and local officials with ties to Bulger, causing embarrassment to several government agencies, especially the FBI.

Five years after his flight from the Boston area, Bulger was added to the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list; he was considered the most wanted person on the list behind Osama bin Laden. Another twelve years passed before he was apprehended along with his longtime girlfriend, Catherine Greig, outside an apartment complex in Santa Monica, California. Bulger and Greig were extradited to Boston and taken to court under heavy guard. In June 2012, Greig pleaded guilty to conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, identity fraud and conspiracy to commit identity fraud, receiving a sentence of eight years in prison. Bulger declined to seek bail and remained in custody.

Bulger&#x27;s trial began in June 2013. He was tried on thirty-two counts of racketeering, money laundering, extortion and weapons charges, including complicity in nineteen murders. On August 12, Bulger was found guilty on 31 counts, including both racketeering charges, and was found to have been involved in eleven murders. On November 14, he was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences plus five years by U.S. District Court Judge Denise J. Casper. Bulger was incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary Coleman II in Sumterville, Florida.

Bulger was transferred to several facilities in October 2018; first to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma and then to the United States Penitentiary, Hazelton, near Bruceton Mills, West Virginia. Bulger, who was in a wheelchair, was beaten to death by inmates on October 30, 2018, within hours of his arrival at Hazelton. In 2022, Fotios Geas, Paul DeCologero and Sean McKinnon were charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in Bulger&#x27;s death.

==Early life==
Whitey Bulger&#x27;s father, James Joseph Bulger Sr., hailed from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, with Irish parents. After settling in Everett, Massachusetts, he married Jane Veronica &quot;Jean&quot; McCarthy, a first-generation Irish immigrant. The eldest of six children, James Joseph Bulger Jr., was born on September 3, 1929. The family moved to Boston shortly after his birth. 

Bulger&#x27;s father worked as a union laborer and occasional longshoreman. He lost his arm in an industrial accident and the family was reduced to poverty. In May 1938, the Mary Ellen McCormack Housing Project was opened in the neighborhood of South Boston. The Bulger family moved in and the children grew up there. While his younger siblings, William Bulger and John P. Bulger, excelled at school, James Bulger Jr. was drawn into street life.

Early in his criminal career, local police gave Bulger the nickname &quot;Whitey&quot; because of his blond hair. Bulger hated the name; he preferred to be called &quot;Jim&quot;, &quot;Jimmy&quot;, or even &quot;Boots&quot;. The last nickname came from his habit of wearing cowboy boots, in which he used to hide a switchblade.

== Early criminal career ==
Bulger developed a reputation as a thief and street fighter fiercely loyal to South Boston. This led to him meeting more experienced criminals and finding more lucrative opportunities. In 1943, 14-year-old Bulger was arrested and charged with larceny. By then he had joined a street gang known as the &quot;Shamrocks&quot; and would eventually be arrested for assault, forgery and armed robbery. Bulger was sentenced to a juvenile reformatory for these offenses.

Shortly after his release in April 1948, Bulger joined the United States Air Force where he earned his high school diploma and trained as a mechanic. Despite the regimented military life, he had not reformed. He spent time in the military prison for several assaults and was later arrested by Air Force police in 1950 for going absent without leave. Nevertheless, he received an honorable discharge in 1952 and returned to Massachusetts.

===Prison===

In 1956, Bulger served his first term in federal prison at Atlanta Penitentiary for armed robbery and truck hijacking. He later told mobster Kevin Weeks that while there, he was used as a human subject in the CIA-sponsored MK-ULTRA program. Bulger later complained that the inmates had been &quot;recruited by deception&quot; and were told they were helping to find &quot;a cure for schizophrenia&quot;, when in fact they were being used to research mind control. Evidence of the experiments were later confirmed when CIA documentation emerged. 

Bulger and eighteen other inmates, all of whom had volunteered in exchange for reduced sentences, were given LSD and other drugs over an eighteen-month period. Bulger later described his experience as &quot;nightmarish&quot; and said it took him &quot;to the depths of insanity,&quot; writing in his notebooks that he heard voices and feared being &quot;committed for life&quot; if he admitted this to anyone.

In 1959, Bulger was briefly transferred to maximum security at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in California. During his time at Alcatraz, he kept in shape through weightlifting and took advantage of educational opportunities afforded to inmates. He completed various correspondence courses including typing, bookkeeping, and business law. He also became a voracious reader, devouring numerous books on poetry, politics, and military history. Later in his sentence, he was transferred to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary and, in 1963, to Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. Bulger&#x27;s third petition for parole, in 1965, was granted after he had served nine years in prison. He would not be arrested again for 46 years.

===Killeen–Mullen War===
After his release, Bulger worked as a janitor and construction worker before becoming a bookmaker and loan shark under mobster Donald Killeen, whose gang, The Killeens, had dominated South Boston for over twenty years. The Killeens were led by three brothers—Donnie, Kenny and Eddie—along with Billy O&#x27;Sullivan and Jack Curran. Their base was the Transit Café in South Boston, which later became Whitey&#x27;s Triple O&#x27;s. 

In 1971, the younger Killeen brother Kenny allegedly shot and mauled Michael &quot;Mickey&quot; Dwyer, a member of the rival Mullen Gang, during a brawl at the Transit Café. A gang war resulted, leading to a string of killings throughout Boston and the surrounding suburbs. The Killeens quickly found themselves outgunned and outmaneuvered by the younger Mullens. It was during the war that Bulger set out to commit what Weeks describes as Bulger&#x27;s first murder, of Mullen member Paul McGonagle. However, Bulger instead executed McGonagle&#x27;s law-abiding brother Donald in a case of mistaken identity.

According to former Mullen boss Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Nee, McGonagle ambushed and murdered O&#x27;Sullivan on the assumption he was the one responsible for his brother&#x27;s killing. Bulger, realizing he was on the losing side, is alleged to have secretly approached Howie Winter, the leader of the Winter Hill Gang, and claimed he could end the war by murdering the Killeen leadership. Shortly thereafter, on May 13, 1972, Donald Killeen was gunned down outside his home in the suburb of Framingham. Although the killing was attributed to Bulger, Nee disputed this, saying that Killeen was murdered by Mullen enforcers James Mantville and Tommy King, not Bulger.

Bulger and the Killeens fled Boston, fearing they would be next. Nee arranged for the dispute to be mediated by Winter and Joseph Russo, &quot;caporegime&quot; of the Patriarca crime family in Rhode Island. In a sit-down at Chandler&#x27;s nightclub in Boston&#x27;s South End, the Mullens were represented by Nee and King, and the Killeens by Bulger. The two gangs joined forces, with Winter as overall boss. Soon afterward, Donald&#x27;s sole surviving brother, Kenny, was jogging in Boston&#x27;s City Point neighborhood when Bulger called him over to a car and said, &quot;It&#x27;s over. You&#x27;re out of business. No more warnings.&quot; Kenny would later testify that Winter Hill enforcers Stephen Flemmi and John Martorano were in the car with Bulger.

===Winter Hill Gang===
After the 1972 truce, Bulger and the Mullens were in control of South Boston&#x27;s criminal underworld. FBI Special Agent Dennis Condon noted in his log in September 1973 that Bulger and Nee had been heavily shaking down the neighborhood&#x27;s bookmakers and loan sharks. Over the years that followed, Bulger began to remove opposition by persuading Winter to sanction the killings of those who &quot;stepped out of line&quot;. In a 2004 interview, Winter recalled that the highly intelligent Bulger &quot;could teach the devil tricks&quot;. During this era, Bulger&#x27;s victims included Mullen veterans McGonagle, King, and James &quot;Spike&quot; O&#x27;Toole.

According to Weeks: As a criminal, he made a point of only preying upon criminals... And when things couldn&#x27;t be worked out to his satisfaction with these people, after all the other options had been explored, he wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use violence. ... Tommy King, in 1975, was one example. ... Tommy&#x27;s problems began when he and Jimmy had worked in Triple O&#x27;s. Tommy, who was a Mullins, made a fist. And Jimmy saw it. ... A week later, Tommy was dead. Tommy&#x27;s second and last mistake had been getting into the car with Jimmy, Stevie, and Johnny Martorano. ... Later that same night, Jimmy killed Buddy Leonard and left him in Tommy&#x27;s car on Pilsudski Way in the Old Colony projects to confuse the authorities.

In 1979, Winter was arrested, along with many members of his inner circle, on charges of fixing horse races. Bulger and Flemmi were left out of the indictments. They stepped into the power vacuum and took over the leadership of the Winter Hill Gang, transferring its headquarters to the Lancaster Street Garage in Boston&#x27;s West End, near the Boston Garden.

===Anti-busing attacks===
In late August or early September 1974, Bulger and an accomplice reportedly set fire to an elementary school in Wellesley to intimidate U.S. District Court Judge Wendell Arthur Garrity Jr. over his mandated plan to desegregate schools in the city of Boston by means of busing. One year later, on September 8, 1975, Bulger and an unidentified person tossed a Molotov cocktail into the John F. Kennedy birthplace in Brookline in retaliation for Senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s vocal support for Boston school desegregation. Bulger then used black spray paint to scrawl &quot;Bus Teddy&quot; on the sidewalk outside of the national historic site.

==FBI informant==

In 1971, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) approached Bulger and attempted to recruit him as an informant in an ongoing effort to gain information on the Patriarca crime family. FBI Special Agent John &quot;Zip&quot; Connolly, who had grown up in Bulger&#x27;s neighborhood, was assigned to make the pitch. However, Connolly failed to win Bulger&#x27;s trust. Three years later, Bulger partnered with Flemmi, unaware that he had been an informant for the FBI since the beginning of his career in 1965.

Although it is a documented fact that Bulger soon followed Flemmi&#x27;s example, exactly how and why continues to be debated. Connolly frequently boasted to his fellow agents about how he had recruited Bulger during a late-night meeting at Wollaston Beach while the two sat in his agency car. Connolly allegedly said that the FBI could help in Bulger&#x27;s feud with influential Patriarca underboss Gennaro &quot;Jerry&quot; Angiulo. After listening to the pitch, Bulger is said to have responded, &quot;Alright, if they want to play checkers, we&#x27;ll play chess. Fuck &#x27;em.&quot;

Weeks considers it more likely that Flemmi had betrayed Bulger to the FBI after being threatened with the loss of his informant status. In 1997, shortly after &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; disclosed that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with Connolly, who showed him a photocopy of Bulger&#x27;s file. In order to explain why both men had chosen to work with the FBI, Connolly said, &quot;The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them.&quot; In a 2011 interview, Flemmi recalled, &quot;Me and Whitey gave [the Feds] shit, and they gave us gold.&quot;

According to Weeks: 

FBI supervisor John Morris was put in charge of the Organized Crime Squad at the FBI&#x27;s Boston field office in December 1977. Morris not only proved himself unable to rein in Connolly&#x27;s protection of Bulger, but even began assisting him. By January 1980, the FBI were aware of Bulger&#x27;s headquarters at the Lancaster Street Garage but failed to investigate or inform other law enforcement agencies of the gang clubhouse. The Massachusetts State Police discovered the location by chance while investigating an auto theft ring, finding that Bulger and Flemmi would openly associate with other organized crime figures, including Donato &quot;Danny&quot; Angiulo, Vincent &quot;the Animal&quot; Ferrara and Phil Waggenheim, at the garage. State troopers carried out surveillance from an adjacent flophouse for six months before being granted a warrant to install covert listening devices on the premises in the summer of 1980. The electronic eavesdropping gathered no evidence, however, as Connolly alerted Bulger and Flemmi that the police had bugged the garage. The gang ceased using the garage for a time after learning that the meeting place was compromised.

In the autumn of 1980, the state police bugged a payphone outside a Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant in Dorchester that was frequently used by Bulger and Flemmi. Immediately after the bug was planted, the gangsters ceased using the telephone. The police became suspicious that Bulger had been tipped off about their investigation, but were unsure of how or by who. Then, in November 1980, the state troopers learned that Morris had errantly told a Boston police detective at a bachelor party that Bulger and his gang knew that the Lancaster Street Garage was bugged, effectively exposing the FBI as the source of the leak. By 1982, Morris was &quot;thoroughly compromised&quot;, to the point of having Bulger purchase plane tickets for his then-girlfriend, Debbie Noseworthy, to visit him in Georgia while he was being trained for drug investigations. Even after 1983, when Morris was transferred to head up the Boston FBI&#x27;s anti-drug task force, he remained an accomplice to Connolly and Bulger.

In the summer of 1983, tensions between the Winter Hill Gang and the Patriarca family escalated to an all-time high. Notably, an employee for Coin-O-Matic, a cash laundering vending machine company owned by the Patriarcas, was kidnapped on the job. The Boston Police Department, operating on a tip, raided a butcher shop in South Boston co-owned by Bulger and two other Winter Hill members. Police officers found the victim hanging from a beef rack, having been severely tortured and held for more than six days. The victim never testified, and all law enforcement documents were redacted of his full name; law enforcement had hoped he would cooperate fully and then go into witness protection. People familiar with Coin-O-Matic knew exactly who the employee was, but the code of silence was still very strong in South Boston. Over the next few months, three low-level Winter Hill Gang soldiers were executed, mostly believed to be in retribution for the kidnapping. The conflict shined a large spotlight on Morris&#x27;s incompetent management and triggered an internal investigation within the FBI.

In 1988, Bulger&#x27;s status as an FBI informant was revealed publicly when the &quot;Globe&quot;″s &quot;Spotlight&quot; team, led by journalist Gerard O&#x27;Neill, published a story detailing the numerous crimes committed and attributed to him while nominally under the protection of the Bureau. Rumors had abounded long before then, since it was unheard of for a criminal of Bulger&#x27;s stature to go for years without a single arrest.

In 1995, Bulger and Flemmi were indicted on racketeering charges along with two prominent Boston &quot;mafiosi&quot;, Frank Salemme and Bobby DeLuca. During the discovery phase, Salemme and DeLuca were listening to a tape from a roving bug, which is normally authorized when the FBI has no advance knowledge of where criminal activity will take place. They overheard two of the agents who were listening in on the bug mention offhandedly that they should have told one of their informants to give &quot;a list of questions&quot; while speaking to the mobsters. When their lawyer, Tony Cardinale, learned about this, he realized that the FBI had lied about the basis for the bug in order to protect an informant. Suspecting that this was not the first time such a thing had happened, Cardinale sought to force prosecutors to reveal the identities of any informants used in connection with the case. Federal judge Mark L. Wolf granted Cardinale&#x27;s motion on May 22, 1997. 

On June 3, Paul E. Coffey, the head of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department of Justice, gave a sworn statement admitting that Bulger had been an FBI informant. Coffey stated that since Bulger was accused of &quot;leading a criminal enterprise&quot; while working as an informant and was also now a fugitive, he had &quot;forfeited any reasonable expectation&quot; that his identity would be protected.

On September 5, 2006, federal judge Reginald C. Lindsay ruled that the mishandling of Bulger and Flemmi caused the 1984 murder of police informant John McIntyre, awarding his family $3.1 million in damages. Lindsay stated the FBI failed to properly supervise Connolly and &quot;stuck its head in the sand&quot; regarding numerous allegations that Bulger and Flemmi were involved in drug trafficking, murder, and other crimes for decades.

==Criminal activities in South Boston==
===Consolidating power===
In February 1979, federal prosecutors indicted numerous members of the Winter Hill Gang, including boss Howie Winter, for fixing horse races. Bulger and Flemmi were originally going to be part of this indictment, but Connolly and Morris were able to persuade prosecutor Jeremiah T. O&#x27;Sullivan to drop the charges against them at the last minute. Bulger and Flemmi were instead named as unindicted co-conspirators.

Bulger and Flemmi then took over the remnants of the Winter Hill Gang and used their status as informants to eliminate competition. The information they supplied to the FBI in subsequent years was responsible for the imprisonment of several of Bulger&#x27;s associates whom Bulger viewed as threats; however, the main victim of their relationship with the federal government was the Patriarca family, which was based in Boston&#x27;s North End and in Federal Hill, Providence, Rhode Island. After the 1986 RICO indictment of Angiulo and his associates, the Patriarca family&#x27;s Boston operations were in a shambles. Bulger and Flemmi stepped into the ensuing vacuum to take control of organized crime in the Boston area.

===The murder of Louis Litif===
In 1980, Bulger was approached in Triple O&#x27;s by Louis Litif, a Lebanese-American neighborhood bookmaker. Weeks, a bouncer at the bar, said, &quot;He wasn&#x27;t a big guy, maybe five seven and 185 pounds. Of Arab descent, he had a mustache like Saddam Hussein. ... That night, as always, he was talking in his obnoxious loud voice. Even when there were 400 people in the bar, you always knew Louie was there.&quot;

Litif had been stealing money from his partners in the bookmaking operation and using the money to traffic cocaine, and had not only refused to pay Bulger a cut of his drug profits but committed two murders without Bulger&#x27;s permission. Litif told an outraged Bulger he was also going to kill his partner, &quot;Joe the Barber&quot;, whom he accused of stealing from the bookmaking operation. Bulger refused to sanction this, but Litif vowed to proceed. Bulger replied, &quot;You&#x27;ve stepped over the line. You&#x27;re no longer just a bookmaker.&quot; Litif responded that, as Bulger was his friend, he had nothing to worry about. Bulger coldly responded, &quot;We&#x27;re not friends anymore, Louie.&quot;

At the time, Weeks was about to get married, and shortly before the wedding he informed Bulger that he was having difficulty finding a seat for Litif at the reception. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it&quot;, Bulger responded. &quot;He probably won&#x27;t show.&quot; &quot;[Louie] had always been a major moneymaker for Jimmy. ... And now he wanted to kill a friend of Jimmy. There was no way that would be allowed. Shortly after that, a week or so before my wedding, Louie was found stuffed into a garbage bag in the trunk of his car, which had been dumped in the South End. He had been stabbed with an ice pick and shot. &#x27;He was color coordinated,&#x27; Jimmy told me. &#x27;He was wearing green underwear and was in a green garbage bag.&#x27;&quot;

According to Weeks,Strangely enough, Jimmy, told me, &#x27;Louie&#x27;s last words to me were a lie.&#x27; Apparently, Louie had insisted that he&#x27;d come by himself and that nobody had driven him over. It was hard to figure out why Louie lied to Jimmy that night. If he&#x27;d told Jimmy that someone had driven him, he might have gotten a pass. But it wouldn&#x27;t have lasted long, since Jimmy had no intention of letting Louie run wild.

===Halloran and Donahue murders===
In 1982, a South Boston cocaine dealer named Edward Brian Halloran, known on the streets as &quot;Balloonhead&quot; because of his large cranium, approached the FBI and stated that he had witnessed Bulger and Flemmi murdering Litif. Connolly kept Bulger and Flemmi closely briefed on what Halloran was saying, specifically his claims, false according to Weeks, to having participated in the Tulsa, Oklahoma murder of businessman Roger Wheeler. Connolly reported that Halloran was shopping this information to the FBI for a chance for him and his family to be placed in the Witness Protection Program. Soon after, on May 11, 1982, Bulger, Flemmi, and Weeks were tipped off that Halloran had returned to South Boston. After arriving at the scene, Weeks staked out the Anthony&#x27;s Pier 4 restaurant, where Halloran was dining. Michael Donahue, a friend of Halloran&#x27;s from Dorchester, incidentally ran into him at the restaurant. In a decision that would prove costly to him, Donahue offered Halloran a ride home.

As Donahue and Halloran drove out of the parking lot in a blue Datsun, Weeks signaled Bulger by stating, &quot;The balloon is in the air&quot; over a walkie-talkie. Bulger then pulled alongside the Datsun in a souped-up 1975 Chevrolet Malibu with another man armed with a silenced MAC-10 submachine gun; Bulger himself carried a .30 Carbine rifle. Both gunmen were disguised; Bulger with an Afro wig and a fake moustache, and the other man in a ski mask. In the disguise, Bulger apparently resembled Jimmy Flynn, a hoodlum with whom Halloran had been feuding. After Bulger yelled &quot;Brian!&quot;, both shooters opened fire and sprayed Halloran and Donahue&#x27;s car with bullets. Donahue was shot in the head and killed instantly. As Halloran stumbled out of the car still alive, Bulger did a U-turn and continued shooting Halloran until his body was &quot;bouncing off the ground&quot;, according to Weeks.

Although he was shot approximately 20 times, Halloran lived long enough to identify his attacker as Bulger associate Flynn, who was later tried and acquitted. Halloran died in hospital from blood loss. Flynn remained the prime suspect until 1999, when Weeks agreed to cooperate with investigators and identified Bulger as one of the shooters. Flemmi has identified the second shooter as Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Nee, who denied the allegation and was never charged.

Shortly after the shootings, Bulger and Weeks returned to the scene to recover one of the Malibu&#x27;s hub caps while police were still present. The following day, Bulger, Weeks and Flemmi, who expressed his disappointment that he hadn&#x27;t taken part in the killings, inspected the bullet-riddled Datsun at a tow lot. Bulger instructed Weeks to dispose of the weapons used in the killings by throwing them in Marine Bay.

Donahue was survived by his wife and three sons. His family and Halloran&#x27;s eventually filed a civil lawsuit against the U.S. government after learning that Connolly had informed Bulger of Halloran&#x27;s informant status. Both families were awarded several million dollars in damages. However, the verdict was overturned on appeal due to the late filing of the claims. Thomas Donahue, who was eight years old when his father was murdered, has become a spokesman for the families of those allegedly murdered by the Winter Hill Gang.

==Peak years==
Throughout the 1980s, Bulger, Flemmi, and Weeks operated rackets throughout eastern Massachusetts including loansharking, bookmaking, truck hijacking, arms trafficking, and extortion. State and federal agencies were repeatedly stymied in their attempts to build cases against Bulger and his inner circle. This was caused by several factors. Among them was the trio&#x27;s fear of wiretaps and policy of never discussing their business over the telephone or in vehicles. Other reasons included South Boston&#x27;s code of silence and corruption within the FBI, the Boston Police Department, and the Massachusetts State Police. Although Connolly was Bulger&#x27;s most infamous source inside law enforcement, Weeks has stated that Massachusetts State Police Lt. Richard J. Schneiderhan, the crew&#x27;s only source inside that agency, was valued more highly.

=== World Jai Alai ===

Winter Hill Gang associate John &quot;Jack&quot; Callahan was fired from his role as president of World Jai Alai (WJA), a business which operated in Florida and Connecticut, after he lost his license to operate a parimutuel betting business in Connecticut due to his associations with organized crime. Callahan then conspired with former FBI agent H. Paul Rico, who had served as Callahan&#x27;s head of security at WJA, and Richard P. Donovan, another former WJA president, to regain control of WJA by purchasing the business from its owner, Tulsa, Oklahoma businessman Roger Wheeler. Callahan offered Bulger, Flemmi and Martorano a $10,000 per week &quot;skim&quot; from the parking and concession proceeds at WJA&#x27;s &quot;fronton&quot; in Hartford, Connecticut if the Winter Hill Gang would protect WJA against interference by the Mafia, to which the gangsters agreed. Wheeler refused to sell WJA to Callahan and his associates, however, and Callahan, Bulger, Flemmi and Martorano agreed that Wheeler had to be killed.

In January 1981, Winter Hill Gang member Brian Halloran was summoned to a meeting with Bulger, Flemmi and Callahan at which he was asked to kill Wheeler, although Halloran declined. Days later, Callahan paid Halloran $20,000 to remain silent about the planned murder. In March 1981, Wheeler sold the Hartford &quot;fronton&quot; amid questions by gaming officials about ties by some of his partners to organized crime. Fearing that Wheeler was on the verge of reporting the skimming operation to authorities, Bulger ordered his murder. On May 27, 1981, Martorano, using guns shipped by bus from Bulger and Flemmi, and wearing a golf cap, sunglasses, and a fake beard, killed Wheeler by shooting him in the face in the parking lot of the Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa.

After Connolly told Bulger in July 1982 that the FBI wanted to question Callahan in connection with Wheeler&#x27;s murder, he and Flemmi decided to kill Callahan. On August 1, 1982, Martorano murdered Callahan by luring him into a car and shooting him in the head during a meeting at Fort Lauderdale International Airport. Martorano, with the assistance of Joseph &quot;Joe Mac&quot; McDonald, then left his body in the trunk of Callahan&#x27;s leased Cadillac in a garage at Miami International Airport. Callahan&#x27;s body was discovered on August 3, 1982 when a parking attendant noticed blood dripping from the trunk of the car. To give the appearance that Callahan had been killed by some &quot;bad Cubans&quot; in a drug-related murder, Bulger told Martorano and McDonald to leave some of Callahan&#x27;s personal papers in a Cuban bar in Little Havana. Allowing Callahan&#x27;s body to be discovered went against Bulger&#x27;s plans, however, leading him to complain about Martorano: &quot;There&#x27;s plenty of sand down there. He should have got off his fat ass and buried him!&quot;.

Following Callahan&#x27;s death, Bulger summoned Callahan&#x27;s business partner, Michael Solimando, to a meeting at Triple O&#x27;s where he told Solimando that he was now responsible for a fictitious debt that Callahan had purportedly owed him. Bulger threatened Solimando, a bodybuilder, with a machine gun and said: &quot;Your muscles aren&#x27;t going to do you any good now&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Solimando delivered $480,000 to the Winter Hill Gang.

At the request of state and local law enforcement in Oklahoma and Florida investigating the murders of Wheeler and Callahan, Bulger and Flemmi were interviewed by two Boston FBI agents, Gerald Montanari and Brendan Cleary, on November 2, 1983. The interview was arranged by Connolly and conducted in the back room of a South Boston club owned by Bulger. Bulger and Flemmi only agreed to be interviewed under the condition that they were interviewed together, and both refused to take a polygraph test. Bulger told the agents that, although he and Flemmi would not usually agree to meet with law enforcement agents about any crime, they had agreed to the meeting because Wheeler was a &quot;legitimate guy&quot; and they wanted to refute the allegations against them. Bulger and Flemmi were photographed in December 1983 after being subpoenaed by a federal grand jury. They wore suits for the photographs on the instruction of Connolly, who told them wearing suits rather than street clothes would make them look more like businessmen and less like criminals. When the photographs were shown to eyewitnesses in the Wheeler murder, neither man was identified. The investigation into the murders ultimately wound down in 1985 with no indictments.

=== The murder of Arthur &quot;Bucky&quot; Barrett ===
The Winter Hill Gang used an unoccupied house owned by the brother of Bulger associate Pat Nee located at 799 East Third Street in South Boston to extort wealthy criminals. One such criminal who came to Bulger&#x27;s attention was Arthur &quot;Bucky&quot; Barrett, a safecracker and thief who was allegedly one of six men who stole $1.5 million from the Depositors Trust bank in Medford on Memorial Day Weekend of 1980. Barrett had refused to give Bulger a cut of the money from the heist, and Bulger believed Barrett was under the protection of the Patriarca family. Bulger asked Weeks to lure Barrett to a secret meeting, and on November 30, 1983, Barrett arrived at the East Third Street home for a purported diamonds sale. When Barrett arrived, Bulger drew a machine gun and yelled: &quot;Bucky Barrett, freeze!&quot;. Bulger and Flemmi then chained Barrett to a chair, and over several hours, Barrett directed the gangsters to the location of $57,00 in hidden cash; $47,000 was retrieved from his home, and another $10,000 from a bar.

After Bulger, Flemmi and Weeks returned to the house with the money, they stood Barrett up and Bulger announced: &quot;Bucky&#x27;s going to go downstairs and lie down for a while&quot;. As Barrett walked downstairs to the basement with Bulger and Flemmi, Bulger shot Barrett in the back of the head without warning, causing Barrett&#x27;s body to hit Flemmi, who tumbled down the stairs with the corpse. An angry Flemmi told Bulger: &quot;You could have shot me!&quot;. Flemmi removed Barrett&#x27;s teeth in the belief it would prevent later identification and then buried the body in the basement with Weeks while Bulger reclined on a couch upstairs. Afterwards, Nee was upset that Barrett had been killed in the house as he had expected only an extortion to take place. Nee&#x27;s brother was vacationing in Florida at the time of the murder and was unaware that Barrett had been killed and buried in his basement.

===Extortion of drug dealers===
During the mid-1980s, Bulger began to summon drug dealers from in and around Boston to his headquarters. Flanked by Weeks and Flemmi, Bulger would inform each dealer that he had been offered a substantial sum in return for that dealer&#x27;s assassination. He would then demand a large cash payment as the price of not killing them. Eventually, however, the massive profits of drugs proved irresistible. Although Bulger cultivated a reputation as a Robin Hood-type gangster who kept South Boston free of narcotics, he became actively involved in the drug trade.

Most of South Boston&#x27;s cocaine and marijuana trafficking was under the control of a crew led by mobster John &quot;Red&quot; Shea. According to Weeks, Bulger briefly considered killing Shea, but eventually decided to extort a weekly cut of his profits. Weeks also said that Bulger enforced strict rules over the dealers who operated on his territory, strictly forbidding the use of PCP and selling drugs to children, adding that those dealers who refused to play by his rules were violently driven out of his turf. In 1990, Shea and his associates were arrested at the end of an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Boston Police, and the Massachusetts State Police. He quietly served a long prison sentence and refused to admit to having paid protection money to Bulger, Flemmi and Weeks. He repeatedly got in fights with other inmates who accused Bulger of being &quot;a rat.&quot; This earned Shea a legendary reputation in South Boston.

It was not until the 1999 cooperation of Weeks that Bulger, by then a fugitive, was conclusively linked to the drug trade by investigators. According to an interview conducted with &quot;Globe&quot; reporters Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphy, Weeks &quot;estimated that Whitey made about thirty million dollars... most of it from shaking down drug dealers to let them do business on his turf.&quot;

===Arms trafficking===
During the most violent period of the Troubles, sympathy for Irish nationalism and the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was very common in South Boston, as were efforts to raise money and smuggle weapons for the IRA&#x27;s campaign against the British presence in Northern Ireland. From the start of his involvement with the FBI, Bulger &quot;insisted ... that he would never give up the IRA&quot;. Bulger had previously donated to NORAID and shipped weapons—&quot;guns and a block of C-4 plastic explosives&quot;—in a van to the IRA in the early 1980s. Bulger was annoyed when he learned that the IRA members he supplied had burned the van that contained the weapons. After meeting with IRA Chief of Staff Joe Cahill, Bulger and Nee raised $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) &quot;by shaking down drug dealers in South Boston and Charlestown&quot;. This money was used to buy weapons for the IRA which would be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean in the trawler &quot;Valhalla&quot;. Bulger also personally donated some of his own weapons.

On September 13, 1984, Bulger, Weeks and Nee supervised the loading of &quot;Valhalla&quot;. The final cache included &quot;91 rifles, 8 submachine guns, 13 shotguns, 51 handguns, 11 bullet-proof vests, 70,000 rounds of ammunition, plus an array of hand grenades and rocket heads&quot;. &quot;Valhalla&quot; departed Gloucester and rendezvoused off the west coast of Ireland with the &quot;Marita Ann&quot;, an IRA ship that had sailed from Tralee. During the return voyage, the Irish Navy stopped &quot;Marita Ann&quot; and seized the hidden arsenal, arresting IRA members Martin Ferris, Mike Browne, and John Crawley. The operation had been compromised by IRA member Sean O&#x27;Callaghan, who was an informant for the Irish National Police. The seizure marked the complete end of any major attempt by the IRA to smuggle guns out of the United States, which had largely ceased three years earlier with the arrest of the primary IRA&#x27;s gunrunner George Harrison by the FBI.

The U.S. Customs Service received notice of the weapons transfer and seized the &quot;Valhalla&quot; when it stopped in Boston on October 16, 1984 en route back to Gloucester harbor. No weapons were found on the trawler, and neither of the two crew members on board were arrested. Several days later, &quot;Valhalla&quot; crew member John McIntyre was arrested for drunk driving while &quot;trying to visit his estranged wife&quot;, and he confessed his role in the weapons smuggling to the Boston Police. McIntyre implicated Bulger in the botched gunrunning to FBI agent Roderick Kennedy, who was friendly with Bulger&#x27;s handler, Connolly. McIntyre also told authorities about drug smuggling activities involving the Winter Hill Gang, and 36 tonnes of marijuana belonging to the gang were seized by the DEA during a raid on the Norwegian freighter &quot;Ramsland&quot; as it entered Boston harbor on November 16, 1984. After hearing of Kennedy&#x27;s interview with a &quot;Valhalla&quot; crew member, Connolly told Bulger of the cooperation. Kennedy &quot;insisted that Connolly overheard him ... talking about someone on the &quot;Valhalla&quot; cooperating&quot;. Connolly confirmed Bulger&#x27;s suspicions of McIntyre, leading Bulger and Flemmi to consider murdering McIntyre for his betrayal.

According to Weeks, when Bulger met with McIntyre in a South Boston house, he hoped to avoid murdering the informant and offered to send him to South America with money and the understanding that he was never to contact his family or friends again. After interrogating McIntyre over several hours, however, Bulger decided that he did not have the discipline to cut ties with everyone. He then killed McIntyre and went upstairs to take a nap while Weeks and Flemmi removed the corpse&#x27;s teeth with a pair of pliers and buried it in the basement. After McIntyre&#x27;s disappearance, an FBI agent, Philip Brady, told McIntyre&#x27;s family that he was likely murdered by the IRA.

===Massachusetts Lottery===
In the summer of 1991, Bulger and Weeks, along with associates Patrick and Michael Linskey, came into possession of a winning Massachusetts Lottery ticket which had been bought at a store he owned. The four men shared a prize of around US$14 million. Bulger was widely thought to have obtained his share of the jackpot illegitimately.

===Downfall===

In April 1994, a joint task force of the DEA, the Boston Police, and the Massachusetts State Police launched a probe of Bulger&#x27;s illegal gambling operations. The FBI, by this time considered compromised, was not informed. After a number of bookmakers agreed to testify to having paid protection money to Bulger, a federal case was built against him under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).

According to Weeks:

Bulger had also set up safe deposit boxes containing cash, jewelry and passports in locations across North America and Europe, including Florida, Oklahoma, Montreal, Dublin, London, Birmingham and Venice. In December 1994, he was informed by Connolly that sealed indictments had come from the Department of Justice and that the FBI was set to make arrests during the Christmas season. In response, Bulger fled Boston on December 23, 1994, accompanied by his common-law wife Theresa Stanley.

==Fugitive==
After fleeing Boston, Bulger and Stanley spent four days over Christmas in Selden, New York, before spending New Year&#x27;s Day in a hotel in New Orleans&#x27;s French Quarter. On January 5, 1995, Bulger prepared to return to Boston, believing that it had been a false alarm. That night, however, Flemmi was arrested outside a Boston restaurant by the DEA. Boston police detective Michael Flemmi, Stephen&#x27;s brother, informed Weeks of the arrest. Weeks immediately passed the information on to Bulger, who altered his plans.

Bulger and Stanley spent the next three weeks traveling to New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco before Stanley decided that she wanted to return to her children. They traveled to Clearwater, Florida, where Bulger retrieved his &quot;Tom Baxter&quot; identification from a safety deposit box. He then drove to Boston and dropped off Stanley in a parking lot. Bulger met with Weeks at Malibu Beach in Dorchester, where Weeks brought Bulger&#x27;s girlfriend, Catherine Greig. Bulger and Greig then went on the run together.

In his memoirs, Weeks describes a clandestine meeting with Bulger and Greig in Chicago. Bulger reminisced fondly about his time hiding out with a family in Louisiana. He told Weeks, who had replaced him as head of the Winter Hill Gang, &quot;If anything comes down, put it on me.&quot; As they adjourned to a nearby Japanese restaurant, Bulger finally revealed how exhausted he was with life on the run. He told Weeks, &quot;Every day out there is another day I beat them. Every good meal is a meal they can&#x27;t take away from me.&quot;
In mid-November 1995, Weeks and Bulger met for the last time at the lion statues at the front of the New York Public Library Main Branch and adjourned for dinner at a nearby restaurant. According to Weeks:

On July 7, 1996, a federal grand jury in Boston returned a 29-count indictment against Bulger and four other leaders of the Winter Hill Gang and the Patriarca Family; Bulger was indicted on 13 counts of racketeering. On May 23, 2001, Bulger, along with Stephen and Michael Flemmi, were charged in a 48-count federal indictment with racketeering, murder, and other crimes.

On November 17, 1999, Weeks was arrested by a combined force of the DEA and the Massachusetts State Police. Although by this time he was aware of Bulger&#x27;s FBI deal, he was determined to remain faithful to the neighborhood code of silence. However, while awaiting trial in Rhode Island&#x27;s Wyatt federal prison, Weeks was approached by a fellow inmate, a &quot;made man&quot; in the Patriarca family, who told him, &quot;Kid, what are you doing? Are you going to take it up the ass for these guys? Remember, you can&#x27;t rat on a rat. Those guys have been giving up everyone for thirty years.&quot;

In the aftermath, Weeks decided to cut a deal with federal prosecutors and revealed where almost every penny was stashed and every body was buried. Writing in 2006, Weeks recalled: 

===Manhunt===
The first confirmed sighting of Bulger before his capture was in London in 2002. A businessman watching &quot;Hannibal&quot; recognized a photograph of Bulger in a scene featuring the website of the FBI&#x27;s most wanted fugitives. However, there were unconfirmed sightings elsewhere. At one point, FBI agents were sent to Uruguay to investigate a lead. Other agents were sent to stake out the 60th anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Normandy, as Bulger was reportedly an enthusiastic fan of military history. Later reports of a sighting in Italy in April 2007 proved false. Two people on video footage shot in Taormina, Sicily, formerly thought to be Bulger and Greig walking in the streets of the city center, were later identified as a tourist couple from Germany.

In 2010, the FBI turned its focus to Victoria, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island. In pursuit of Bulger, a known book lover, the FBI visited bookstores in the area, questioned employees and distributed wanted posters. Following his arrest, Bulger revealed that instead of being reclusive, he had in fact traveled frequently, with witnesses coming forward to say they had seen him on the Santa Monica Pier and elsewhere in southern California. A confirmed report by an off-duty Boston police officer after a San Diego screening of &quot;The Departed&quot; also led to a search in southern California that lasted &quot;a few weeks&quot;.

===Capture===
After sixteen years at large and twelve years on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, Bulger was arrested in Santa Monica, California, on June 22, 2011. He was 81 years old at the time of the arrest.

Bulger was captured as a result of the work of the Bulger Fugitive Task Force, which consisted of FBI agents and a Deputy U.S. Marshal. According to retired FBI agent Scott Bakken, &quot;Here you have somebody who is far more sophisticated than some 18-year-old who killed someone in a drive-by. To be a successful fugitive you have to cut all contacts from your previous life. He had the means and kept a low profile.&quot;

A reward of US$2 million had been offered for information leading to his capture. This amount was second only to Osama bin Laden&#x27;s capture reward on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Bulger had been featured on the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; sixteen times, first in 1995, and finally on October 2, 2010. According to authorities, the arrests were a &quot;direct result&quot; of the media campaign launched by the FBI in fourteen television markets across the country where Bulger and Greig reportedly had ties. The campaign focused on Greig, describing her as an animal lover who frequently went to beauty salons.

Authorities received a tip from a woman in Iceland that Bulger was living in an apartment near a beach in Santa Monica. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; identified the tipster as Anna Björnsdóttir, a former model, actress, and Miss Iceland 1974, who lived in Bulger&#x27;s neighborhood.
A day later, &quot;using a ruse, agents and other task force members lured Mr. Bulger out of his apartment&quot;, &quot;arrested him &#x27;without incident&#x27;, then went in the house and arrested Greig&quot;.
During the raid the FBI found &quot;Weapons all over the apartment&quot; and &quot;loaded shotguns, mini rugers, rifles.&quot;

Bulger was charged with murder, &quot;conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, narcotics distribution and money-laundering&quot;. Agents found &quot;more than $800,000 in cash, 30 firearms, and fake IDs&quot; at the apartment. Carmen Ortiz, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said &quot;she believes the death penalty is not an option in the federal charges Bulger faces in her district, but that he could face the death penalty for two cases outside the district&quot;. In Oklahoma, where Bulger is alleged to have ordered the killing of businessman Roger Wheeler Sr., in 1981, Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris said, &quot;It is our intention to bring Bulger to justice and to be held accountable for the murder of Mr. Wheeler&quot;. In Florida, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said, &quot;After a 16-year delay, I will be working to ensure that a Miami jury has the opportunity to look [Bulger] in the eyes and determine his fate&quot;.

Immediately after being brought back to Boston, Bulger began talking to authorities. He said that during his days as a fugitive he often went back and forth across the border to Mexico to buy medicine for his heart disease. He also reported that if he thought he was going to die, he planned to die with his body hidden so that authorities would always be looking for him. Many anticipated, and some feared, that Bulger, in exchange for favorable treatment in sentencing, would have much to tell authorities about corruption at the local, state and federal levels, which allowed him to operate his criminal enterprise for so long.

Bulger was arraigned in federal court on July 6, 2011. He pleaded not guilty to 48 charges, including 19 counts of murder, extortion, money laundering, obstruction of justice, perjury, narcotics distribution and weapons violations.

In a 2011 interview, Kevin Weeks expressed surprise at Bulger&#x27;s decision to cooperate after his arrest. Weeks said, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand because he&#x27;s not the same as I remember him. I can&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s so chatty right now. So I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing&quot;. Weeks added that he is not afraid of Bulger, and that the residents of Boston should not be either: &quot;I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s Pablo Escobar where he can just walk out of his prison cell and come to South Boston or anywhere. No, no one&#x27;s worried about him.&quot;

===Catherine Greig===

Bulger&#x27;s companion during his years as a fugitive was his longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig (born April 3, 1951), who was nearly 22 years his junior. Greig grew up in Boston and had an identical twin sister, Margaret, and a younger brother, David. Their father was a machinist from Glasgow, Scotland, and their mother was from Canada.

In 1971, at about age 20, Greig married Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; McGonagle, a Boston firefighter. Greig&#x27;s identical twin sister, Margaret, married Robert McGonagle&#x27;s brother, Paul. The McGonagle brothers were from a family that led the Mullen Gang. Robert McGonagle was injured during a mob gunfight in 1969. Before his 1987 death by drug overdose, Robert McGonagle reportedly held Bulger responsible for the murders of his twin brothers, Donald and Paul, who were killed in the fighting which occurred during the Mullen-Killeen gang war. Paul&#x27;s body was hidden and buried for 25 years on Tenean Beach in Dorchester.

Greig began dating Bulger in 1975, aged 24, after she split from McGonagle in 1973. Greig and McGonagle were officially granted a divorce in 1977. She worked as a dental hygienist. Greig has been described as intelligent, hardworking, and educated, although she was very subservient to and dominated by Bulger. She and Bulger lived together for a time at her home in Squantum, a section of Quincy. In 1982, they began sharing a condominium in Quincy&#x27;s Louisburg Square South apartment complex.

Before going on the run with Bulger, she was last seen by the FBI on January 5, 1995, as she and Kevin Weeks were under surveillance in an attempt to locate Bulger. Greig had been wanted by the FBI since 1999. In 2000, the FBI received a tip of a sighting of Greig in Fountain Valley, California. The criminal complaint against her alleges that she harbored a fugitive, Whitey Bulger. She was represented in the criminal proceedings by the prominent criminal attorney Kevin Reddington of Brockton, Massachusetts. After being captured with Bulger, Greig sought release on bail and home confinement, a request that was denied.

Greig initially indicated that she would go to trial rather than accept a plea bargain. In March 2012, however, Greig pleaded guilty to conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, identity fraud, and conspiracy to commit identity fraud. On June 12, 2012, she was sentenced to eight years in federal prison. She declined to speak during her sentencing.

In September 2015, Greig was indicted on a charge of criminal contempt stemming from her refusal to testify before a grand jury about whether other people aided Bulger while he was a fugitive. In February 2016, Greig pleaded guilty to this charge. Greig&#x27;s attorney recommended 12 months in prison, while prosecutors—citing Greig&#x27;s &quot;unrepentant ... obstruction&quot;—asked for 37 months. In April 2016, U.S. District Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV sentenced Greig, then midway through her sentence for harboring Bulger, to 21 months on the contempt charge, pushing her release date to late 2020.

Greig served much of her eight-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Waseca in Minnesota, but was also detained at various points in Rhode Island ahead of proceedings in the criminal contempt case. Greig completed her sentence on July 23, 2020, and was later released from home confinement and electronic monitoring.

===Final detention===

According to an excerpt of a book on Bulger published by &quot;Boston magazine&quot;, Bulger only made one friend during his post-sentencing detention, Clement &quot;Chip&quot; Janis, a young convict who was trusted to run art classes for other convicts.

When Bulger arrived at the United States Penitentiary in Tucson there were other famous inmates there, including Brian David Mitchell, Steven Dale Green and Montoya Sánchez.

According to Janis, Bulger was attacked by a fellow convict nicknamed &quot;Retro&quot;, whose knife pierced Bulger&#x27;s neck and skull and sent him to the prison infirmary for a month. Whether Bulger was targeted randomly or deliberately is not known. Apparently the inmate was not motivated by any personal issues with Bulger, but committed the near-fatal assault so that he would be sent to solitary confinement, allegedly to avoid paying for drugs he had acquired from other prisoners.

Bulger was able to begin taking part in counseling with a prison psychologist at the Tucson facility. However, rumors circulated that the psychologist was too sympathetic to Bulger, and may even have allowed him to use her cell phone. His counseling was soon terminated, and he was transferred to the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Florida.

At Coleman, Bulger started experiencing night terrors, which he attributed to the experiments he had taken part in while incarcerated in the 1950s, where he had been administered LSD. Bulger, who started his imprisonment with a rigorous exercise regime, was by this point using a wheelchair.

==Racketeering trial and conviction==

On June 12, 2013, Bulger went on trial in South Boston&#x27;s John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse before Judge Denise J. Casper on 32 counts of racketeering and firearms possession. The racketeering counts included allegations that Bulger was complicit in 19 murders. The trial lasted two months and included the testimony of 72 witnesses; the jury began deliberations August 6. On August 12, the jury convicted Bulger of 31 out of 32 counts in the indictment. As part of the racketeering charges, the jury convicted Bulger of the murders of 11 victims—Paul McGonagle, Edward Connors, Thomas King, Richard Castucci, Roger Wheeler, Brian Halloran, Michael Donahue, John Callahan, Arthur &quot;Bucky&quot; Barrett, John McIntyre, and Deborah Hussey. The jury acquitted Bulger of killing Michael Milano, Al Plummer, William O&#x27;Brien, James O&#x27;Toole, Al Notorangeli, James Sousa and Francis Leonard. They also reported themselves unable to agree about the murder of Debra Davis, though Bulger had already been found liable for her death in a civil suit. Following the verdict, Bulger&#x27;s attorneys J. W. Carney Jr. and Hank Brennan vowed to appeal, citing Casper&#x27;s ruling which prevented Bulger from claiming he had been given immunity.

On November 14, 2013, Bulger was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment, plus five years. Casper told Bulger that such a sentence was necessary given his &quot;unfathomable&quot; crimes, some of which inflicted &quot;agonizing&quot; suffering on his victims. He was also ordered to forfeit $25.2 million and pay $19.5 million in restitution. Prosecutors in Florida and Oklahoma announced after Bulger&#x27;s conviction that they would wait until after sentencing concluded before deciding whether or not to prosecute Bulger in their states. Bulger was indicted in Florida for the murder of Callahan and in Oklahoma for the murder of Roger Wheeler, and could have received the death penalty in those states.

In September 2014, Bulger entered the Coleman II United States Penitentiary in Sumterville, Florida. In October 2018, he was transferred to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, and then a few days later to the Federal Penitentiary in West Virginia. According to prison documents obtained by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bulger gained a reputation for disconcerting behavior during his time in prison: &quot;At the Coleman prison complex in Florida in September 2014, he was disciplined multiple times, including once for masturbating in front of a male staff member and once, in February, for threatening a female medical staff member&quot;. Bulger was also in poor health, as he was unable to walk and had a damaged hip, often falling out of bed. His health also declined due to a lack of exercise.

==Death==

Bulger was transferred from the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City to United States Penitentiary, Hazelton, in West Virginia on October 29, 2018. At 8:20 a.m. on October 30, the 89-year-old Bulger was found dead. Bulger was in a wheelchair and had been beaten to death by multiple inmates armed with a sock-wrapped padlock and a shiv. His eyes had nearly been gouged out and his tongue almost cut off; a law enforcement official described Bulger as &quot;unrecognizable&quot;. This was the third homicide at the prison in a 40-day span. Correctional officers had warned Congress just days before his death that facilities were being dangerously understaffed. Massachusetts-based mafia hitman Fotios &quot;Freddy&quot; Geas was the primary suspect in orchestrating the killing of Bulger. Geas, 51, and his brother were sentenced to life in prison in 2011 for their roles in several violent crimes, including the 2003 killing of Adolfo &quot;Big Al&quot; Bruno, a Genovese crime family capo who was shot in a Springfield, Massachusetts parking lot. According to ABC News, Bulger&#x27;s medical status had been lowered on October 8, 2018, shortly before he was transferred.

On November 8, 2018, a funeral Mass was held for Bulger at Saint Monica – Saint Augustine Church in South Boston. Family members, including his brother, former Massachusetts state Senate president William M. Bulger, and the twin sister of Catherine Greig attended. Bulger&#x27;s death came as a relief to many Bostonians, especially for family members of his victims; Steven Davis, whose sister Debra was reportedly killed by Bulger in 1981, stated that &quot;[h]e died the way I hoped he always was going to die.&quot;

Bulger is buried at St. Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery in the Boston neighborhood of West Roxbury. His headstone is blank, except for the inscription “Bulger”. In September 2019, the Bulger family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Justice Department, alleging that, by lowering Bulger&#x27;s medical status and transferring him to Hazelton, he &quot;was deliberately placed in harm&#x27;s way. There is simply no other explanation for the transfer of someone in his condition and inmate status to be placed in the general population of one of the country&#x27;s most violent federal penitentiaries.&quot; The Bulger family sought 200,000 in damages. In January 2022, U.S. District Judge John Preston Bailey dismissed the lawsuit, ruling federal law did not allow his family the right to sue Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officials because Congress expressly puts custody of inmates in the hands of the BOP, and &quot;has repeatedly limited judicial authority to review BOP housing decisions and to entertain claims brought by prisoners.&quot;

On August 18, 2022, Geas was indicted in connection with the beating death of Bulger, along with Paul J. DeCologero and Sean McKinnon. On May 14, 2024, the Department of Justice announced that plea agreements with the three had been accepted. On 6 September 2024, Fotios Geas was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for voluntary manslaughter in Bulger&#x27;s killing.

==Family==
Bulger had two younger brothers, William Michael &quot;Billy&quot; Bulger (born 1934) and John &quot;Jackie&quot; P. Bulger (born 1938). William Bulger served in the military during the Korean War but was never posted to Korea. He was formerly an influential leader of the Democratic Party in Massachusetts. In a long political career, William rose to become President of the Massachusetts Senate. After his retirement he was appointed President of the University of Massachusetts system.

In December 2002, William Bulger appeared before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and refused to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In April 2003, the committee voted &quot;to grant William Bulger immunity to obtain information concerning Whitey&#x27;s whereabouts and the FBI&#x27;s misuse of informants.&quot; In June 2003, William appeared before the committee, where he was grilled by legislators from both parties. He testified: &quot;I do not know where my brother is. I do not know where he has been over the past eight years. I have not aided James Bulger in any way while he has been a fugitive.&quot; He added: &quot;while I worried about my brother, I now recognize that I didn&#x27;t fully grasp the dimensions of his life. Few people probably did. By definition, his was a secretive life. His actions were covert, hidden even from—or perhaps hidden especially from those who loved and cared about him. The subject that interests so many, the life and the activities of my brother James is painful and difficult for me.&quot; William said that the only contact with his brother during the fugitive years was a short telephone call in January 1995, shortly after his brother was indicted. Following this testimony, Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney waged an extended and ultimately successful effort to get William to resign from the presidency of the University of Massachusetts, which he finally did in August 2003.

John &quot;Jackie&quot; Bulger, a retired Massachusetts court clerk magistrate, was convicted in April 2003 of committing perjury in front of two grand juries regarding sworn statements he gave concerning contacts with his fugitive brother.

==Personal life==
Bulger fathered one child, Douglas Glenn Cyr (1967–1973), during a 12-year relationship with Lindsey Cyr, a waitress and former fashion model living in North Weymouth, Massachusetts. Bulger and Cyr began living together in 1966, when Cyr was 21 and a waitress at a North Quincy café. According to Cyr, &quot;He used to say that there were four people he would turn up on a street corner for: Douglas, me, Billy, or his mother. And we all made him vulnerable.&quot; At six years of age, Douglas died from Reye syndrome after having a severe allergic reaction to an aspirin injection. Lindsey Cyr later recalled it as:

After Bulger&#x27;s arrest, Cyr announced her support of him, stating:
After his split from Cyr, Bulger began a relationship with Theresa Stanley, a South Boston divorcée with several children. Bulger bought her an expensive house in suburban Quincy, Massachusetts, and acted as father to her children while commuting to &quot;work&quot; in South Boston. However, he was repeatedly unfaithful to her with a host of other women, and was often absent while overseeing the running of his organization. In a 2004 interview, Stanley stated that she was planning to publish her memoirs; however, she died of lung cancer in 2012 at the age of 71.

==Press relations==
According to Weeks:

===Paul Corsetti===
According to Weeks&#x27;s memoirs, in 1980 &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reporter Paul Corsetti began researching an article about Louis Litif&#x27;s murder and Bulger&#x27;s suspected involvement. After reporting the story for several days, Corsetti was approached by a man who said, &quot;I&#x27;m Jim Bulger and if you continue to write shit about me, I&#x27;m going to blow your fucking head off.&quot; Corsetti sought help from the Patriarca crime family, but they said that Bulger was outside their control. &quot;The next day, Corsetti reported the meeting to the Boston police. He was issued a pistol permit within 24 hours. The cop who gave him the permit told him, &#x27;I&#x27;m glad my last name is not Corsetti.&#x27; A couple days later Jimmy told me about the scene with the cop and was glad to hear how uncomfortable he had made Corsetti.&quot;

===Howie Carr===
In his memoirs, Kevin Weeks related his participation in an attempt to assassinate reporter Howie Carr at his house in suburban Acton. Weeks stated that Carr was targeted because he was &quot;writing nasty stories about people, he was an oxygen thief who didn&#x27;t deserve to breathe.&quot; Carr has been among the most aggressive critics of the Bulger brothers, Whitey and Billy, for their careers in the Boston area; among his works is the book &quot;The Brothers Bulger,&quot; detailing the Bulger brothers&#x27; 25-year period of controlling Boston politics and the Boston underworld.

Weeks stated that, although several plans were considered, all were abandoned because there was too much risk of injuring Carr&#x27;s wife and children. The plans climaxed with Weeks&#x27; own attempt to shoot Carr with a sniper rifle as he came out of his house. However, when Carr came out the front door holding the hand of his young daughter, Weeks could not bring himself to shoot. He wanted another opportunity to &quot;finish the job,&quot; but Bulger advised him to forget about Howie Carr. In his 2006 memoir Weeks said that, although he was aware of the public outcry that would have followed, he regretted not murdering Carr. &quot;His murder would have been an attack on the system, like attacking freedom of the press, the fabric of the American way of life, and they would have spared no expense to solve the crime. But in the long run, Jimmy and I got sidetracked and the maggot lived. Still, I wish I&#x27;d killed him. No question about it.&quot;

== Depictions in fiction and non-fiction ==
* The 2014 documentary film &quot;&quot;, made by Joe Berlinger, is based on Bulger&#x27;s trials.
* The film &quot;Black Mass&quot;released September 18, 2015, in the USstars Johnny Depp as Bulger and was directed by Scott Cooper. The film&#x27;s screenplay is based on the 2001 non-fiction book &quot;Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob&quot;, by Dick Lehr and Gerard O&#x27;Neill. 

===Characters based on Whitey Bulger===
* The character of Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson) in the 2006 Martin Scorsese film &quot;The Departed&quot; is loosely based on Bulger.
* The 2006–2008 Showtime TV series &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, about two Irish-American brothers on opposite sides of the law, was inspired by the relationship between Whitey and Billy Bulger, although the show takes place not in Boston but in nearby Providence, Rhode Island.
* The 2013 television drama &quot;The Blacklist&quot; starring James Spader, about a career criminal who turns himself in to work with the FBI on his own terms, was inspired by Bulger&#x27;s arrest and trial.
* The character Marty Butler in Dennis Lehane&#x27;s novel &quot;Small Mercies&quot; was heavily inspired by Bulger.
* While the DC Comics villain Carmine Falcone was inspired by Vito Corleone from the Godfather trilogy in the source material, director Matt Reeves claimed to have patterned his iteration of the character after Bulger in &quot;The Batman&quot; film released in 2022, portrayed by John Turturro. A younger version of Falcone is portrayed by Mark Strong in &quot;The Penguin&quot; spin-off miniseries which premiered in 2024.

<text>Ludwig Crüwell (20 March 1892 – 25 September 1958) was a German army general who served in the Afrika Korps of Nazi Germany during World War II. He was a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. Crüwell was captured by British forces on 29 May 1942 and was interned at Trent Park, the British camp for high-ranking POW where his conversations were subject to covert surveillance.

==Career==
Crüwell became commander of the 11th Panzer Division in August 1940 and led it during the Invasion of Yugoslavia; he received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross afterwards. Then the division took part in Operation Barbarossa; he was promoted to Generalleutnant and received the Oak Leaves to his Knight&#x27;s Cross.

Crüwell became commander of the Afrika Korps on 31 July 1941, under General Erwin Rommel, who on the same day took command of Panzer Army Africa, consisting of one infantry and two panzer divisions. For health reasons he took actual command on 15 September, and was promoted to General der Panzertruppe on 17 December 1941. On 29 May 1942, Crüwell was inspecting operations by air in Libya. His pilot mistook British troops for Italian soldiers and landed, where Crüwell was taken prisoner.

Crüwell was interned at Trent Park to the north of London, known as the &quot;Cockfosters Cage&quot;, a Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre for senior officers operated by MI19 and equipped with an &quot;M Room&quot; listening facility to secretly record and translate the conversations of the inmates. Here, on March 22, 1943, he was intentionally placed with another POW, General Wilhelm von Thoma. During their conversation, Thoma disclosed intelligence regarding the V-2 rocket, i.e., surprise that London was not yet in ruins from German rockets being tested at Kummersdorf test grounds he had visited. This led to the British investigating Peenemünde and following confirmation, carried out a bombing raid on the Peenemünde facilities which severely disrupted the program.
Crüwell led the pro-Nazi group of German officers at Trent park, who were outnumbered by those opposed to the regime. The British intelligence files recorded in his character profile that &quot;he tried to impress everyone with his own importance and knowledge, a trouble-maker and a bore&quot;. In mid-1944, Crüwell was transferred to a facility in the United States.

After the war Crüwell settled in Essen. He became Chairman of the Veterans Association of the Germany Africa Corps and died on 25 September 1958.

<doc id="579495" wikidata="Q2712090" url="?curid=579495" title="Sinclair QDOS">
<text>QDOS is the multitasking operating system found on the Sinclair QL personal computer and its clones. It was designed by Tony Tebby whilst working at Sinclair Research, as an in-house alternative to 68K/OS, which was later cancelled by Sinclair, but released by original authors GST Computer Systems. Its name is not regarded as an acronym and sometimes written as Qdos in official literature.

QDOS was implemented in Motorola 68000 assembly language, and on the QL, resided in 48 KB of ROM, consisting of either three 16 KB EPROM chips or one 32 KB and one 16 KB ROM chip. These ROMs also held the SuperBASIC interpreter, an advanced variant of BASIC programming language with structured programming additions. This also acted as the QDOS command-line interpreter.

Facilities provided by QDOS included management of processes (or &quot;jobs&quot; in QDOS terminology), memory allocation, and an extensible &quot;redirectable I/O system&quot;, providing a generic framework for filesystems and device drivers. Very basic screen window functionality was also provided. This, and several other features, were never fully implemented in the released versions of QDOS, but were improved in later extensions to the operating system produced by Tebby&#x27;s own company, QJUMP.

Rewritten, enhanced versions of QDOS were also developed, including Laurence Reeves&#x27; Minerva and Tebby&#x27;s SMS2 and SMSQ/E. The last is the most modern variant and is still being improved.

== Versions ==
QDOS versions were identified by numerical version numbers. However, the QL firmware ROMs as a whole (including SuperBASIC) were given two- or three-letter alphabetic identifiers (returned by the SuperBASIC function &quot;VER$&quot;).

The following version of QDOS were released (dates are estimated first customer shipments):

* 0.08: the last pre-production version.
* 1.00: corresponded to the &quot;FB&quot; version QL ROMs, released in April 1984.
* 1.01: corresponded to the &quot;PM&quot; version ROMs. This was faster and had improved Microdrive support.
* 1.02: corresponded to the &quot;AH&quot; ROM version released in June 1984. This fixed many bugs and was the first ROM version to be produced in quantity.
* 1.03: included in ROM versions &quot;JM&quot; and &quot;TB&quot;; a minor bug-fix release issued in late 1984.
* 1.10: corresponded to the &quot;JS&quot; and &quot;JSU&quot; (US export version) ROMs, released in early 1985. This was the last version used in QLs manufactured for the UK market.
* 1.13: corresponding to the &quot;MG&quot;x series of ROM versions for European export markets. Included a significant number of bug fixes. The following localised versions of the &quot;MG&quot; firmware are known to exist:
** &quot;MGE:&quot; Spanish
** &quot;MGF:&quot; French
** &quot;MGG:&quot; German
** &quot;MGI:&quot; Italian
** &quot;MGS:&quot; Swedish

The localised versions of QDOS were identified by the &quot;.&quot; in the version number being replaced by the ROM version suffix letter used to identify the territory, e.g. the &quot;MGE&quot; ROMs contained QDOS version 1E13. All &quot;MG&quot; firmware versions shared the same bottom 32 KB ROM chip. Qdos 1.13 was also reported to be included in a Greek localised ROM version, known as &quot;ΣFP&quot; (marked on the ROMs as &quot;EFP&quot;).

<doc id="579498" wikidata="Q2705645" url="?curid=579498" title="Tromsdalen UIL">
<text>Tromsdalen UIL is a Norwegian sports club founded in 1938, from Tromsdalen in the municipality of Tromsø. It has sections for football, athletics, skiing and gymnastics.

The men&#x27;s football team plays in 2. divisjon, the third level in Norwegian football. Their home games are played at Tromsdalen Stadion, which seats 3,000 spectators. Their colors are red and blue.

==Football==
The team was promoted to the 1. divisjon in 2003, but was relegated after one season. The club was reintroduced to the second highest flight of Norwegian football, which in the meantime had changed its name to Adeccoligaen, in 2005. After a poor start to the 2006 season, Tromsdalen was in the relegation zone for most of the season. But a very good ending of the season, beating many top clubs, Tromsdalen survived the drop and played in 1. divisjon in the 2007 season as well. However, they were relegated to 2. divisjon in 2007. The stay there wasn&#x27;t long; Tromsdalen finished champion in Fourth Group of 2. divisjon in 2008 and returned to 1. divisjon for the 2009 season. After two seasons in 1. divisjon, Tromsdalen was relegated to the 2. divisjon.

In 2011, Tromsdalen scored 105 goals in the 2. divisjon, which is a Norwegian record, and again won promotion to the second tier.

In 2007 Tromsdalen&#x27;s women&#x27;s team played in the women&#x27;s first division.

In the 2019 season, Tromsdalen has to play their home games at Alfheim Stadion because their floodlights were not approved by the Football Association of Norway.

This quote is used by the Bush campaign to attack Kerry by claiming he is weak on terrorism, and used by Bush in the debate on October 13: &quot;We have to get back to the place we were, where terrorists are not the focus of our lives, but they&#x27;re a nuisance. As a former law-enforcement person, I know we&#x27;re never going to end prostitution. We&#x27;re never going to end illegal gambling. But we&#x27;re going to reduce it, organized crime, to a level where it isn&#x27;t on the rise. It isn&#x27;t threatening people&#x27;s lives every day, and fundamentally, it&#x27;s something that you continue to fight, but it&#x27;s not threatening the fabric of your life.&quot;
** Bush-Cheney campaign headquarters in Spokane, Washington are broken into.

Eighteen Democratic senators oppose the showing, and ask the FCC to rule that Kerry is entitled to equal time. FCC Commissioner Michael J. Copps comes out against the broadcast, saying, &quot;This is an abuse of the public trust.&quot; On Fox News&#x27; &quot;Dayside with Linda Vester&quot; the next day, Kerry campaign spokesman Chad Clanton accused Sinclair of &quot;obliterating every decent journalistic standard in the book.&quot; He also said of Sinclair: &quot;I think they&#x27;re going to regret this. They better hope we don&#x27;t win.&quot; Sinclair is known for supporting President Bush, and in April refused to broadcast an episode of Nightline that reported on American military casualties in Iraq, for fear that it would hurt the Republican campaign.,

MTV labels Gillespie&#x27;s threat as censorship, and replies that &quot;Just because President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and Secretary Rumsfeld, and for that matter Senator Kerry, say that there is not going to be a draft does not make it so.&quot;

** In Colorado, voter registration fraud becomes a concern as paid voter registration gatherers flood the state. One Coloradan tells local TV that he had registered to vote &quot;about 35 times&quot; after repeated encounters with registration gatherers. ACORN, whose registration gatherers are linked to similar cases in Ohio and Florida, cooperates with Colorado authorities to trace hundreds of questionable registrations. But ACORN Western regional director Jim Fleischmann argues that local media are making too much of the issue: &quot;Registration fraud is different than voter fraud. Just because you register someone 35 times doesn&#x27;t mean they get to vote 35 times. They can only vote once.&quot;

==In depth analysis of week of 2004 election==

This page contains a timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election. For a more in-depth discussion of the candidates and issues at stake in that election and the campaign history leading up to election day, see U.S. presidential election, 2004. For information on other races conducted the same day, see U.S. Senate election, 2004 and U.S. House election, 2004. For an explanation of the U.S. presidential election process see U.S. Electoral College.

The U.S. presidential election occurred on November 2, 2004. However, as in the 2000 U.S. election, the election was too close for a winner to be declared that night. By the next morning, the Republican campaign was declaring a victory while the results in several states remained too close for the media to declare winners. Soon afterward the Kerry campaign decided that there were not enough uncounted votes in Ohio for them to win that state and Kerry telephoned Bush to concede. At 2 p.m. EST, Kerry held a news conference announcing the same. An hour later, Bush held his own to accept his victory.

In Ohio, the Libertarian and Green parties raised $113,600 necessary to fund a recount of the popular vote, which took place in early December and upheld the Bush victory in that state.

===Tuesday, November 2, 2004===

====Morning====
* Citizens in two small New Hampshire towns were the first to have their ballots counted in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. The polls were opened at midnight and closed within minutes as everyone who had registered had voted. In Dixville Notch, the more famous of the two due to its longstanding tradition of early voting, the incumbent lost ground compared to his showing in 2000, but got more total votes than the challenger: Bush –19, Kerry – 7. Bush also won the vote in Hart&#x27;s Location, which managed to report its results slightly earlier this year; Bush – 16, Kerry – 14, and Nader – 1. (09:00 UTC, November 2, 2004, Associated Press (Associated Press) (Reuters) In both cases this represented a small swing compared with the 2000 results from the Republican candidate to the Democratic candidate.
* &quot;U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens Tuesday allowed Republicans to challenge voter qualifications at the polls in Ohio, a key battleground state that could determine the presidential election. Stevens acted on an emergency request shortly before polls opened in Ohio and across the nation.&quot; He refused to set aside a U.S. appeals court order, issued Monday, which, reversing a lower court&#x27;s ban, permitted political party members to challenge the credentials of potential voters at polling places across the state. -Reuters (Bloomberg)
* Some reports say Florida, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., (and possibly other states) have received record numbers of requests for absentee ballots for this election. Absentee ballots are counted differently based on the state, with most states counting them on election day, but with some exceptions, the last deadline being 10 days after the election (all Washington, D.C., absentee ballots, and oversea absentee ballots in Ohio and Florida). Washington State allows 15 days after the election for out of country absentee ballots to come in. It is possible that absentee ballots are being requested due to concerns about electronic voting, or simply due to an expected high overall voter turnout.

====Afternoon====
* Early exit polling shows strong Kerry battleground states edge. Early exit polling has in the past tended to favor Republicans, though it favored Al Gore in several key states in the 2000 election.
* Leroy Chiao, currently stationed on the International Space Station, cast his vote by encrypted e-mail and became the first American to vote in a presidential election from space.
* Slate reports exit polls from ten states, with John Kerry winning in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and New Mexico. Bush projected to win in Nevada, North Carolina and Colorado. Together with the polls from MyDD there are results from 34 states. Kerry leads with 192 electoral votes, while Bush has 152.
* Based on exit polls, Zogby predicts a decisive 311 to 213 win for Kerry with 14 electoral votes too close to call.
* As the day progresses, late-day exit polls show that Florida has flipped to Bush, but by a narrow margin, and Nevada to Kerry, giving the challenger a 289–249 edge.

====Evening====
* At 7:00 pm EST, polls close in GA, IN, KY, SC, VT, and VA. CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox News Channel all agree in projecting Georgia, Indiana, and Kentucky for Bush, and Vermont for Kerry, giving the Republicans a 34–3 lead.
* At 7:30 pm, polls close in OH and WV. ABC, CBS, CNN, and Fox News call West Virginia for Bush. NBC waits 15 minutes before concurring. Bush leads 39–3.
* At 8:00 pm, polls are closed in AL, CT, DE, DC, FL, IL, KS, ME, MD, MA, MI, MS, MO, NJ, OK, PA, TN, and TX. CNN, CBS, Fox, and NBC project Alabama, Oklahoma, and Tennessee for President Bush; Connecticut, Delaware, Washington DC, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine (at-large vote and first congressional district), New Jersey, and Vermont for Senator Kerry: current electoral vote is 77–66, Kerry ahead. ABC does not call Maine until a half-hour later and has Kerry ahead 74–66.
* NBC calls North Carolina for Bush, 81–77 for Bush
* CNN (and ABC, and possibly others) projects South Carolina (8), Virginia (13), Kansas (6), Nebraska (4), North Dakota (3), South Dakota (3), Texas (34) and Wyoming (3) for President Bush, and New York (31) and Rhode Island (4) for Senator Kerry. Projected count 155–112 for Bush. According to these numbers, both candidates have won the same states that their parties won in the 2000 election, but redistribution of districts means that the Democrats have lost 5 electoral votes and the Republicans have won 2 with respect to those elections.
* CNN and ABC project Louisiana (9) and Mississippi (6) for the president, leaving the count at 170–112 for the incumbent.
* FoxNewsChannel has Bush at 193–112 with Missouri (11), Arkansas (5) and Utah (5) now in the Bush column.

* BBC, ABC, CBS, CNN call Nevada for Bush. FOX News and MSNBC, who both earlier called Ohio for Bush, do not call Nevada for Bush—yet as of 4:07 a.m. EST. (Calling both for Bush would be equivalent to calling the presidency for Bush.)
* NBC calls Minnesota for Kerry.
* Tom Brokaw of NBC News refuses to call Nevada for Bush as long as outstanding absentee ballots (rumored to be as many as 60,000) have not been counted. Another reason for refusal is the contention by the Kerry camp that Ohio should not be called for Bush.
* BBC, CNN call Wisconsin for Kerry.
* On a special edition of &quot;Today&quot;, Tom Brokaw announces that NBC News will not call any more states for either candidate as long as the Kerry camp contests the Bush win in Ohio. This puts the NBC News electoral vote count at 269 for Bush and 238 for Kerry.

* Voting machines controversy in PA. Before polls even opened in Philadelphia, 2,000 votes had already been cast on voting machines. Drudge Report. Philadelphia election officials and the district attorney quickly discounted this, apparently Republican operatives mistakenly believed the counter that records the total number of votes ever made on the voting machines was a count for a candidate.
* Voting machines controversy in Ohio. Walden O&#x27;Dell, the head of Diebold Incorporated, had said in 2003 that he is &quot;committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year.&quot;
* In Iowa, a glitch with an optical vote counting machine caused Greene County to not report results for 6 of 15 precincts.

===Thursday, January 6, 2005===
* The electoral vote for the United States Presidency is officially certified as 286 for Republican President George W. Bush, 251 for Democratic Senator John Kerry, and 1 for Democratic Senator John Edwards, leading to Bush&#x27;s reelection, despite a formal challenge to Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the first challenge since 1877, resulting in a vote — 1-74 (Yea-Nay) in the Senate and 31–267 in the House.

==Election incidents==
As of November 10, there were 31,515 reported incidents of voting problems nationally, with approx. 350 new incidents being reported a day. One-third of the problems (12,074) involved voter registration, followed by &quot;polling place inquiries&quot; (7,073), absentee ballot-related problems (3,218) and machine problems (1,599). The latter included complaints that some machines registered votes for George W. Bush when the voter selected John Kerry.

Some allege that voting locations that used electronic voting machines that did not issue a paper receipt or offer auditability correlate geographically with areas that had unilateral discrepancies between exit poll numbers and actual results. Exit polling data in these areas show significantly higher support for Kerry than actual results (outside the margin of error). Some are concerned that, from a statistical perspective, this may be indicative of vote rigging, because the likelihood of this happening by chance is less than 1 in 50,000. Others point out this could be explained by poor exit polling techniques or all discrepancies may be within the margin of error.


The first map shows the counties that voted democratic in the 2004 election. The dark blue counties are the most densely populated counties in Florida. The second map shows the Florida counties where absentee voting problems were reported. Orange counties had between 10 and 100 reported problems. The third map shows the Florida counties that use touch-screen electronic voting machines in red. The fourth map shows the Florida counties in which machine problems were reported. Incidents reports for Palm Beach, Broward County, Miami-Dade, and others are available at.
The above map shows all reported election incidents. The dark red states have over 1,000 reported incidents, red states have &gt;100, orange have &gt;10, yellow have &gt;1. An interactive map is available at voteprotect.org.

===Third party candidates===
===Colorado constitutional amendment===
* – Colorado had a constitutional amendment, Amendment 36, on the ballot this year which could have changed the process by which its electoral votes were distributed. The vote failed, so Colorado awarded all 9 of its electoral votes to Bush, the winner of the vote in that state. Results of the vote follow:

===Maine and Nebraska splits===
** – Maine and Nebraska are unlike the other 48 states and the District of Columbia in that they allocate their electoral votes in the following manner: 1 for the winner of each congressional district, 2 for the state winner. However, neither state split the vote, so each of these states effectively went winner-take-all.

===Pre-election odds===
* On Tradesports, the Bush futures contract dropped from about 53, where it had been for several days before election, to about 30, in about an hour, but then rallied to 65–66 by 15:30 UTC. On Betfair the odds on a Bush victory increased from 1.75 at the beginning of the day, to 5.0 at 13:00 UTC, and moved down to 1.33 at 15:20 UTC.
* Oddschecker gave real time odds and accurate reflection of probabilities from various UK bookmakers.
* The Iowa Futures Market briefly showed Bush losing ground, with Kerry picking up.
* The price of light crude oil dropped the day before election by nearly $1.63 (3.2%), amid speculation that a win for Kerry would result in the abolition of President Bush&#x27;s maximum-capacity Strategic Petroleum Reserve policy. Oil prices continued to fall after the election.

<doc id="579508" wikidata="Q1059658" url="?curid=579508" title="German invasion of Hungary (1944)">
<text>In March 1944, Hungary was occupied by the Wehrmacht. This invasion was formally known as Operation Margarethe (Unternehmen Margarethe).

==Course of events==

Hungarian Prime Minister Miklós Kállay, who had been in office from 1942, had the knowledge and the approval of Hungarian Regent Miklós Horthy to secretly seek negotiations for a separate peace with the Allies in early 1944. Hitler wanted to prevent the Hungarians from deserting Germany. On 12 March 1944, German troops received orders by Hitler to capture critical Hungarian facilities.

Hitler invited Horthy to the Palace of Klessheim, near Salzburg. On the evening of 15 March 1944, when Admiral Horthy was watching a performance of the opera &quot;Petofi&quot;, he received an urgent message from the German Embassy minister Dietrich von Jagow, which stated that he had to see Horthy immediately at the German legation. When Horthy arrived, von Jagow gave him a letter from Hitler saying Hitler wanted to see him at Schloss Klessheim in Austria on 18 March. As both heads of state conducted their negotiations at Schloss Klessheim, German forces not already stationed in Hungary quietly marched from Reichsgaue of the Ostmark into Hungary. The meeting served merely as a ruse to keep Horthy out of the country and to leave the Hungarian Army without orders.

Negotiations between Horthy and Hitler lasted until 18 March, when Horthy boarded a train to return home. On 19 March, the military occupation of Hungary began.

When Horthy arrived in Budapest, German soldiers were waiting for him at the station. Horthy was told by von Jagow that Hungary would remain sovereign only if he removed Kállay and replaced him with a government that would co-operate fully with Germany. Otherwise, Hungary would be subject to an undisguised occupation. Horthy appointed Döme Sztójay as prime minister to appease German concerns.

Being a complete surprise, the occupation was quick and bloodless. The initial German plan was to immobilise the Hungarian Army, but with Soviet forces advancing from the north and the east and the prospect of British and American forces invading the Balkans, the German military decided to retain Hungarian forces in the field and so sent troops to defend the passes through the Carpathian Mountains from a possible invasion.

Following the German military occupation, Adolf Eichmann was instructed to arrange the transportation of 550,000 Hungarian Jews from wartime Hungary (including Jews from territories that had been annexed from Czechoslovakia (Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia), Romania and Yugoslavia) to extermination camps with Hungarian authorities&#x27; collaboration.

==Aftermath==
Despite the occupation, Horthy regardless attempted to negotiate a peace treaty and surrender with the Soviet Union. By October 1944 the Soviet Budapest offensive was nearly ready to launch and Horthy made a radio broadcast that an armistice had been agreed. The Germans were ready, however. Horthy was overthrown in Operation Panzerfaust, a coup that placed the National Socialist-friendly Arrow Cross Party (NyKP) in power. Following the Siege of Budapest the capital fell to the Soviets on 13 February 1945 and the government fled.

<text>Petasites is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae, that are commonly referred to as butterburs and coltsfoots. They are perennial plants with thick, creeping underground rhizomes and large rhubarb-like leaves during the growing season. Most species are native to Asia or southern Europe.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus name is derived from the Greek word &quot;petasos&quot;, from the plant&#x27;s broad leaves resembling a wide-brimmed hat.

==Species==
;Accepted species
* &quot;Petasites albus&quot; – white butterbur – Europe, Algeria, Turkey, Caucasus, India
* &quot;Petasites fominii&quot; – Republic of Georgia
* &quot;Petasites formosanus&quot; – Taiwan
* &quot;Petasites frigidus&quot; – Arctic butterbur or Arctic sweet coltsfoot – Scandinavia, Mongolia, Canada, northern USA
* &quot;Petasites hybridus&quot; – common butterbur – Europe, Mediterranean
* &quot;Petasites japonicus&quot; – giant butterbur, fuki – China, Japan, Korea
* &quot;Petasites kablikianus&quot; – southeastern Europe from Poland to Albania
* &quot;Petasites kamengicus&quot; – Arunachal Pradesh
* &quot;Petasites paradoxus&quot; – central + southwestern Europe from Spain to Poland
* &quot;Petasites pyrenaicus&quot; syn. &quot;Petasites fragrans&quot; - winter heliotrope - from Azores to Ireland + Tunisia
* &quot;Petasites radiatus&quot; – Mongolia
* &quot;Petasites rubellus&quot; – Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea
* &quot;Petasites sibiricus&quot; – Siberia
* &quot;Petasites spurius&quot; – Europe, Siberia, Caucasus, Central Asia

* &quot;Petasites tricholobus&quot; – China, Vietnam, Himalayas
* &quot;Petasites versipilus&quot; – Sichuan, Yunnan

;Species of hybrid origin
*&quot;Petasites × vitifolius&quot;

;Species formerly included
&quot;Petasites glacialis&quot; &quot;Endocellion glaciale&quot; 

== Characteristics ==
The short spikes of flowers are produced just before the leaves in late winter (e.g. &quot;Petasites fragrans&quot;) or spring, emerging with only a few elongated basal bracts and are usually green, flesh coloured or dull white depending on the species. It is dioecious, with male and female flowers borne on separate plants.

Butterbur can be found in parts of Asia such as Korea, China, and Japan, as well as Europe and North America. They prefer moist environments such as riverbanks, marshes and ditches.

&quot;Petasites&quot; is closely related to the genera &quot;Tussilago&quot; and &quot;Senecio&quot;.

==Medicinal uses==
Butterbur has been used for over 2000 years to treat a variety of ailments including fever, lung disease, spasms, and pain. Currently, butterbur extract is used for migraine prevention and treatment of allergic rhinitis, which have the most evidence for its effectiveness.

===Migraine===
Some butterbur species contain the chemicals petasin and isopetasin which are believed to have potential benefits in treating migraines. High concentrations of petasin occur in both butterbur root and leaves, with the leaves containing lower levels of the toxic chemical. Butterbur extracts have been reported to be effective in reducing frequency and severity of migraine headaches. Several double-blind studies have shown that high doses of &quot;Petasites hybridus &quot;extract&quot;, &quot;containing petasin and/or isopetasin, are effective both in preventing and in relieving migraine, with the best results in groups taking the higher dose of the supplement. Although mainly well tolerated, the adverse effects of butterbur reported in clinical trials include mainly gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, flatulence, and belching. In 2015, the American Academy of Neurology withdrew its original endorsement of butterbur due to safety concerns. However, the Canadian Headache Society still recommends its use in migraine prevention for a selected number of patients based on their clinical features and co-existing disorders.

===Hay fever or allergic rhinitis===
Additionally, a study showed butterbur extract to be an effective treatment for hay fever without the sedative effect of the antihistamine cetirizine, if taken four times daily. Butterbur was also shown to be comparably effective as fexofenadine when compared to placebo for reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

==Risks==
Butterbur extracts may contain harmful components called pyrrolizidine alkaloids if the preparations are not carefully and fully purified. The concentration of the toxic alkaloids is often highest in the rhizomes and lowest in the leaves, and may vary depending on where the plants are grown. These chemicals are toxic to the liver and may cause cancers. Thus, due to the potential for contamination, taking butterbur supplements is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Some sources say it is safe practice to consume butterbur extract that has been prepared by a reputable laboratory. Other sources say no butterbur product is safe: &quot;The cases of liver toxicity appear to have occurred with extracts of butterbur where the pyrrolizidine alkaloids had been removed and only small amounts remained. There is some evidence that other constituents found in butterbur such as the sesquiterpene constituents for example petasin may be implicated in the liver toxicity&quot;.

Long-term health effects and interaction of butterbur with other drugs have not been well documented. However, it can theoretically interact with certain blood pressure and heart medications, as well as with drugs that can induce a liver enzyme called CYP3A4 (i.e. St. John&#x27;s wort, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin); this interaction can potentially lead to increased concentration of the toxic alkaloids.

<text>Think Big was an interventionist state economic strategy of the Third National Government of New Zealand, promoted by the Prime Minister Robert Muldoon (1975–1984) and his National government in the early 1980s. The Think Big schemes saw the government borrow heavily overseas, running up a large external deficit, and using the funds for large-scale industrial projects. Petrochemical and energy related projects figured prominently, designed to utilise New Zealand&#x27;s abundant natural gas to produce ammonia, urea fertiliser, methanol and petrol.

The National Cabinet Minister Allan Highet coined the &quot;Think Big&quot; label in a speech to a National Party conference in 1977. Economist Brian Easton also used the term &quot;think big&quot; in describing economic strategies.

==History==
In the late 1970s New Zealand&#x27;s economy was suffering from the aftermath of the 1973 energy crisis, from the loss of its biggest export market upon Britain&#x27;s joining the European Economic Community, and from rampant inflation.

In 1978 New Zealand faced a further crisis in oil-supply. OPEC continued to raise the price of oil. Then in 1979 the Iranian Revolution paralysed that country&#x27;s oil-industry and of oil per day were withdrawn from world supply.

In 1978 Bill Birch became the Minister of Energy. He looked to the substantial reserves of natural gas under Taranaki and off its coast as an opportunity to bring life to the ailing economy.

In 1979 the oil crisis worsened. During the first half of 1979 OPEC raised oil prices from US$12 a barrel to US$19 a barrel. The New Zealand government banned weekend sales of petrol. On 30 July 1979 the government introduced carless days, where private motorists had to choose one day of the week, on which they could not drive their motor vehicle. Heavy fines were imposed for motorists who were caught driving on their nominated carless day.

The increases in oil prices substantially worsened the country&#x27;s already precarious terms of trade. The cost of oil loomed as the major component of the New Zealand balance of payments deficit. Muldoon&#x27;s administration intended the Think Big projects to reduce New Zealand&#x27;s reliance on imports, especially oil, and thus improve the balance of payments.

==Projects==
The core Think Big projects included the construction of the Mobil synthetic-petrol plant at Motunui, the complementary expansion of the Marsden Point Oil Refinery near Whangārei, and the building of a stand-alone plant at Waitara to produce methanol for export. Motunui converted natural gas from the off-shore Maui field to methanol, which it then converted to petrol on-site. Declining oil prices rendered this process uneconomic and saw a reduction in the production of synthetic fuel; however, the industry still remained at large due to prior investment. New Zealand would abandon the manufacturing of synthetic petrol in February 1997, allowing the plant to switch the focus to methanol..

The construction of the Clyde Dam on the Clutha River formed part of a scheme to generate electricity for the national grid. A proposed smelter at Aramoana on Otago Harbour was never built—largely owing to resistance on the grounds of the environmental damage that would have been a consequence.

===List of projects===
* methanol plant at Waitara
* ammonia/urea plant at Kapuni
* synthetic-petrol plant at Motunui
* expansion of the Marsden Point Oil Refinery
* expansion of the New Zealand Steel plant at Glenbrook
* electrification of the North Island Main Trunk Railway between Te Rapa and Palmerston North
* a third reduction line at the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter, near Bluff
* the Clyde Dam on the Clutha River.

==Measuring outcome==

New Zealand&#x27;s economy suffered from the major investments made by the government. Investment incentives and macroeconomic ratios were heavily affected by the billions of dollars borrowed for the Think Big projects. On 27 September 1982, Muldoon introduced &#x27;The Wage Freeze Regulations&#x27; that would freeze wages and prices on a national scale until 22 June 1983. The policy had attempted to target inflation, but in turn reduced profitability for exporters unable to adapt prices.

Approval of Think Big, at least during and soon after the time of its implementation, tended to rely on party affiliations (with National Party supporters backing the projects, while Labour Party supporters initially opposed them). Think Big projects became synonymous with further inflation and industrial trouble. Richard Prebble said to the Labour Cabinet during the Māori loan affair: &quot;Better to talk about the $7 billion that was borrowed (by Muldoon for Think Big) than about the $600 million that wasn’t.&quot;

<text>Udawalawe National Park is a national park on the boundary of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces in Sri Lanka. The park was created to provide a sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction of the Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River, as well as to protect the catchment of the reservoir. The reserve covers of land area and was established on 30 June 1972.

Before the designation of the national park, the area was used for shifting cultivation (chena farming). The farmers were gradually removed once the national park was declared. The park is from Colombo. Udawalawe is an important habitat for water birds and Sri Lankan elephants. It is a popular tourist destination and the third-most visited park in the country.

== Physical features ==
Udawalawe lies on the boundary of Sri Lanka&#x27;s wet and dry zones. Plains dominate the topography, though there are also some mountainous areas. The Kalthota Range and Diyawini Falls are in the north of the park and the outcrops of Bambaragala and Reminikotha lie within it. The park has an annual rainfall of , most of which falls during the months of October to January and March to May. The average annual temperature is about , while relative humidity varies from 70% to 83%. Well-drained reddish-brown soil is the predominant soil type, with poorly drained low humic grey soils found in the valley bottoms. Mainly alluvial soils form the beds of water courses

== Ecology ==

The habitat surrounding at the reservoir includes marshes, the Walawe river and its tributaries, forests and grasslands. Dead trees standing in the reservoir are visual reminders of the extent of forest cover before the construction of the Udawalawe Dam. Green algae, including &quot;Pediastrum&quot; and &quot;Scenedesmus&quot; spp., and blue green algae species such as &quot;Microsystis&quot;, occur in the reservoir. Areas of open grassland are abundant as a result of former chena farming practices. There is a plantation of teak beyond the southern boundary, below the dam, which was planted before the declaration of the park. Species recorded from the park include 94 plants, 21 fish, 12 amphibians, 33 reptiles, 184 birds (33 of which are migratory), and 43 mammals. Additionally 135 species of butterflies are among the invertebrates found in Udawalawe.

== Flora ==
&quot;Hopea cordifolia&quot;, &quot;Memecylon petiolatum&quot;, &quot;Erythroxylon zeylanicum&quot;, and &quot;Jasminum angustifolium&quot; are endemic floral species recorded from the park. &quot;Hopea cordifolia&quot; is found along the river along with &quot;Terminalia arjuna&quot;. &quot;Panicum maximum&quot; and &quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot; are important food sources for the elephants. &quot;Chloroxylon swietenia&quot;, &quot;Berrya cordifolia&quot;, &quot;Diospyros ebenum&quot;, &quot;Adina cordifolia&quot;, &quot;Vitex pinnata&quot;, &quot;Schleichera oleosa&quot;, and &quot;Diospyros ovalifolia&quot; are the common taller trees. &quot;Terminalia bellirica&quot; and &quot;Phyllanthus emblica&quot; are plants of medicinal value found in the forest. &quot;Cymbopogon confertiflorus&quot; grass species and &quot;Grewia tiliifolia&quot; bushes are common in the grasslands.

== Fauna ==

=== Mammals ===
Udawalawe is an important habitat for Sri Lankan elephants, which are relatively hard to see in its open habitats. Many elephants are attracted to the park because of the Udawalawe reservoir, with a herd of about 250 believed to be permanently resident. The Udawalawe Elephant Transit Home was established in 1995 for the purpose of looking after abandoned elephant calves within the park. A total of nine calves, on two occasions in 1998 and 2000, with another eight calves in 2002, were released in the park when old enough to fend for themselves.

The rusty-spotted cat, fishing cat and Sri Lankan leopard are members of the family Felidae present in Udawalawe. The Sri Lankan sloth bear is seldom seen because of its rarity. Sri Lankan sambar deer, Sri Lankan axis deer, Indian muntjac, Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain, wild boar and water buffalo are among other mammal species. Golden jackal, Asian palm civet, toque macaque, tufted grey langur and Indian hare also inhabit the park. A study conducted in 1989 found that considerable numbers of golden palm civets inhabit the forests of Udawalawe. Five species of mice also have been recorded from the park. The endemic Ceylon spiny mouse, known from Yala National Park, was recorded in Udawalawe in 1989. Indian bush rat and three species of mongoose are also recorded in the national park.

=== Birds ===

Udawalawe is also a good birdwatching site. Endemics such as Sri Lanka spurfowl, red-faced malkoha, Sri Lanka grey hornbill, brown-capped babbler, and Sri Lanka junglefowl are among of the breeding resident birds. White wagtail and black-capped kingfisher are rare migrants. A variety of water birds visit the reservoir, including cormorants, the spot-billed pelican, Asian openbill, painted stork, black-headed ibis and Eurasian spoonbill.

The open parkland attracts birds of prey such as white-bellied sea eagle, crested serpent-eagle, grey-headed fish eagle, booted eagle, and changeable hawk-eagle. Landbirds are in abundance, and include Indian roller, Indian peafowl, Malabar pied hornbill and pied cuckoo.

=== Reptiles and fish ===
Oriental garden lizards, painted-lip lizards, mugger crocodiles, Asian water monitors, Bengal monitors and 30 species of snake are found in the park. &quot;Garra ceylonensis&quot; is an endemic fish species recorded in park. Introduced &quot;Oreochromis&quot; spp., giant gourami, catla, and rohu are important food fish species found in the reservoir.

== Conservation ==
Clearing natural forests and planting monospecies cultures such as pine and eucalyptus are causing reduced water levels in the Walawe river. Encroachment by human settlements, poaching, illegal logging, gem mining, overgrazing and chena farming are major threats to the park. &quot;Lantana camara&quot; and &quot;Phyllanthus polyphyllus&quot; are invasive weeds affecting the food plants of the elephants. Occasions of elephants being shot with illegal muzzleloader guns has been reported.

== Tourism ==
In the six months ending in August 2009, the park earned revenue of Rs. 18.2 million. From 1994 to 2001 some 423,000 people visited the park, 20% of them foreigners. For the 1998–2001 period average annual revenue was 280,000. Postage stamps bearing the images of four wild animals of Udawalawe were issued on 31 October 2007 in the series &quot;National Parks of Sri Lanka&quot;, featuring water buffalo, Sri Lankan elephant, ruddy mongoose and tufted grey langur.

<text>Hawk-Eye is a computer vision system used to visually track the trajectory of a ball and display a profile of its statistically most likely path as a moving image. It is used in more than 20 major sports, including cricket, tennis, Gaelic football, badminton, hurling, rugby union, association football and volleyball, 

The Sony-owned Hawk-Eye system was developed in the United Kingdom by Paul Hawkins. The system was originally implemented in 2000 for television purposes in cricket. It works via the use of up to ten high-performance cameras, normally positioned on the underside of the stadium roof, which track the ball from different angles. The video from the cameras is then triangulated and combined to create a three-dimensional representation of the ball&#x27;s trajectory. Hawk-Eye is not infallible, but is advertised to be accurate to within 2.6 millimetres and is increasingly used as an impartial review in sports. It has been accepted by governing bodies in tennis, cricket and association football as a means of adjudication. Hawk-Eye has been used for the Challenge System since 2006 in tennis and Decision Review System in cricket since 2009. The system is also used to determine whether the ball has crossed the goal line in football as a means of goal-line technology, implemented in the 2013–14 Premier League season and now present at many domestic leagues and international competitions.

==Method of operation==
All Hawk-Eye systems are based on the principles of triangulation using visual images and timing data provided by a number of high-speed video cameras located at different locations and angles around the area of play. For tennis there are 10 cameras. The system rapidly processes the video feeds from the cameras and ball tracker. A data store contains a predefined model of the playing area and includes data on the rules of the game.

In each frame sent from each camera, the system identifies the group of pixels which corresponds to the image of the ball. It then calculates for each frame the position of the ball by comparing its position on at least two of the physically separate cameras at the same instant in time. A succession of frames builds up a record of the path along which the ball has travelled. It also &quot;predicts&quot; the future flight path of the ball and where it will interact with any of the playing area features already programmed into the database. The system can also interpret these interactions to decide infringements of the rules of the game.

The system generates a graphic image of the ball path and playing area, which means that information can be provided to judges, television viewers or coaching staff in near real-time.

The tracking system is combined with a back-end database and archiving capabilities so that it is possible to extract and analyse trends and statistics about individual players, games, ball-to-ball comparisons, etc.

==History==
Hawk-Eye was developed in 2000 by engineers at Roke Manor Research Limited, then a Siemens subsidiary in Romsey, England. Paul Hawkins and David Sherry submitted a United Kingdom patent application for the technology, but this was subsequently withdrawn. All of the technology and intellectual property was spun off into a separated company, Hawk-Eye Innovations Ltd, based in Winchester, Hampshire. This was initially established as a joint venture between Roke Manor Research and Sunset + Vine. At the time, Sunset + Vine produced the Channel 4 television cricket coverage where Hawk-Eye was first used.

On 14 June 2006 a group of investors—led by the Wisden Group and that included Mark Getty, a member of the wealthy American family and business dynasty—bought the company for £4.4m. The acquisition was intended to strengthen Wisden&#x27;s presence in cricket and allow it to enter tennis and other international sports, with Hawk-Eye working on implementing a system for basketball. According to Hawk-Eye&#x27;s website, the system produces much more data than that shown on television.

Put up for sale in September 2010, it was sold as a complete entity to Japanese electronic giant Sony in March 2011 in a deal that valued the company at £15m-£20m.

==Deployment in sport==
===Cricket===
The technology was first used by Channel 4 during a Test match between England and Pakistan on Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, on 21 May 2001. It is used by the majority of television networks to track the trajectory of balls in flight. Its major use in cricket broadcasting is in analysing leg before wicket (LBW) decisions, where the likely path of the ball can be projected forward, through the batsman&#x27;s legs, to see if it would have hit the stumps.

In the winter season of 2008/2009 the ICC trialled a referral system where Hawk-Eye was used for referring decisions to the third umpire if a team disagreed with an LBW decision. Initially the third umpire was able to look at what the ball actually did up to the point when it hit the batsman, but could not look at the predicted flight of the ball after it hit the batsman. The third umpire is now able to see the projected path of the ball too, and Hawk-Eye is currently sanctioned in international cricket even though some doubts remain about its accuracy.

When an LBW decision is referred to Hawk-Eye, it assists in assessing against three criteria:
* Where the ball pitched (in particular with respect to the stumps)
* The location of impact on the leg of the batsman (in particular with respect to the stumps)
* The projected path of the ball past the batsman

In all three cases, marginal calls result in the on-field umpire&#x27;s call being maintained.

Due to its real-time coverage of bowling speed, the system is also used to show delivery patterns of a bowler&#x27;s behaviour such as line and length, or swing/turn information. At the end of an over, all six deliveries are often shown simultaneously to illustrate a bowler&#x27;s variations, such as slower deliveries, bouncers and leg-cutters. A complete record of a bowler can also be shown over the course of a match.

Batsmen also benefit from the analysis of Hawk-Eye, as a record can be brought up of the deliveries from which a batsman scored. These are often shown as a 2-D silhouetted figure of a batsman and colour-coded dots of the balls faced by the batsman. Information such as the exact spot where the ball pitches or speed of the ball from the bowler&#x27;s hand (to gauge batsman reaction time) can also help in post-match analysis.

===Tennis===
: &quot;For a history of electronic line calling in tennis, see Electronic line judge&quot;
In Serena Williams&#x27;s quarter final loss to Jennifer Capriati at the 2004 US Open, three line calls went against Williams in the final set (an Auto-Ref system was being tested during the match). Though the calls were not reversed, there was one overrule of a clearly incorrect line umpire call, by the chair umpire Mariana Alves, that the TV replay showed to be good. These errors prompted talks about line calling assistance especially as the Auto-Ref system was being tested by the U.S. Open at that time and was shown to be very accurate.

In late 2006 Hawk-Eye was tested by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in New York City and was passed for professional use. Hawk-Eye reported that the New York tests involved 80 shots being measured by the ITF&#x27;s high speed camera, a device similar to MacCAM. During an early test of the system at an exhibition tennis tournament in Australia (seen on local TV), there was an instance when the tennis ball was shown as &quot;Out&quot;, but the accompanying word was &quot;In&quot;. This was explained to be an error in the way the tennis ball was shown on the graphical display as a circle, rather than as an ellipse. This was immediately corrected.

Hawk-Eye has been used in television coverage of several major tennis tournaments, including Wimbledon, the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships, the Australian Open, the Davis Cup and the Tennis Masters Cup. The US Open Tennis Championship announced they would make official use of the technology for the 2006 US Open where each player receives two challenges per set. It is also used as part of a larger tennis simulation implemented by IBM called PointTracker.

The 2006 Hopman Cup in Perth, Western Australia, was the first elite-level tennis tournament where players were allowed to challenge point-ending line calls, which were then reviewed by the referees using Hawk-Eye technology. It used 10 cameras feeding information about ball position to the computers. Jamea Jackson was the first player to challenge a call using the system.

In March 2006, at the Nasdaq-100 Open in Key Biscayne, Florida, Hawk-Eye was used officially for the first time at a tennis tour event. Later that year, the US Open became the first grand-slam tournament to use the system during play, allowing players to challenge line calls.

The 2007 Australian Open was the next grand-slam event to implement Hawk-Eye in challenges to line calls, where each tennis player in Rod Laver Arena was allowed two incorrect challenges per set and one additional challenge should a tiebreak be played. In the event of an advantage final set, challenges were reset to two for each player every 12 games, i.e. 6-all, 12-all, etc. Controversies followed the event as at times Hawk-Eye produced erroneous output. In 2008, tennis players were allowed three incorrect challenges per set instead. Any leftover challenges did not carry over to the next set. Once, Amélie Mauresmo challenged a ball that was called in, and Hawk-Eye showed the ball was out by less than a millimetre, but the call was allowed to stand. As a result, the point was replayed and Mauresmo did not lose an incorrect challenge.

The Hawk-Eye technology used in the 2007 Dubai Tennis Championships had some minor controversies. Defending champion Rafael Nadal accused the system of incorrectly declaring an out ball to be in following his exit. The umpire had called a ball out; when Mikhail Youzhny challenged the decision, Hawk-Eye said it was in by . Youzhny said after that he himself thought the mark may have been wide but then offered that this kind of technology error could easily have been made by linesmen and umpires. Nadal could only shrug, saying that had this system been on clay, the mark would have clearly shown Hawk-Eye to be wrong. The area of the mark left by the ball on hard court is a portion of the total area that the ball was in contact with the court (a certain amount of pressure is required to create the mark).

The 2007 Wimbledon Championships also implemented the Hawk-Eye system as an officiating aid on Centre Court and Court 1, and each tennis player was allowed three incorrect challenges per set. If the set produced a tiebreak, each player was given an additional challenge. Additionally, in the event of a final set (third set in women&#x27;s or mixed matches, fifth set in men&#x27;s matches), where there is no tiebreak, each player&#x27;s number of challenges was reset to three if the game score reached 6–6, and again at 12–12. Teymuraz Gabashvili, in his first round match against Roger Federer, made the first-ever Hawk-Eye challenge on Centre Court. Additionally, during the finals of Federer against Rafael Nadal, Nadal challenged a shot which was called out. Hawk-Eye showed the ball as in, just clipping the line. The reversal agitated Federer enough for him to request (unsuccessfully) that the umpire turn off the Hawk-Eye technology for the remainder of the match.

In the 2009 Australian Open fourth round match between Roger Federer and Tomáš Berdych, Berdych challenged an out call. The Hawk-Eye system was not available when he challenged, likely due to a particularly pronounced shadow on the court. As a result, the original call stood.

In the 2009 Indian Wells Masters quarterfinals match between Ivan Ljubičić and Andy Murray, Murray challenged an out call. The Hawk-Eye system indicated that the ball landed on the centre of the line despite instant replay images showing that the ball was clearly out. It was later revealed that the Hawk-Eye system had mistakenly picked up the second bounce, which was on the line, instead of the first bounce of the ball. Immediately after the match, Murray apologised to Ljubicic for the call, and acknowledged that the point was out.

The Hawk-Eye system was developed as a replay system, originally for TV broadcast coverage. As such, it initially could not call ins and outs live.The representation of the trajectory results in terms of where the ball lands is called Shot Spot.

The Hawk-Eye Innovations website states that the system performs with an average error of . The standard diameter of a tennis ball is , equating to a 5% error relative to ball diameter. This is roughly equivalent to the fluff on the ball.

Hawk-Eye has developed a technology called &#x27;Hawk-Eye Live&#x27;, which uses the 10 cameras to call shots in or out in real time, with an &#x27;out&#x27; call being signified by a speaker emitting an &#x27;out&#x27; sound that emulates a human line judge. The technology was initially expected to be in place for the 2019 US Open. The 2021 Australian Open was the first Grand Slam tournament to use Hawk-Eye Live for all matches in place of line judges, in part to reduce personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the US Open later that year. Previously, the 2020 US Open used Hawk-Eye in place of line judges for all matches except those held at Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium.

Clay court tournaments, notably the French Open, are generally free of Hawk-Eye technology due to marks left on the clay where the ball bounced to evidence a disputed line call. Chair umpires are then required to get out of their seat and examine the mark on court with the player by their side to discuss the chair umpire&#x27;s decision. The 2021 Mutua Madrid Open became the first major tournament on clay to use an electronic system to check the bounce of the ball on the court when in doubt in the two main stadiums (Manolo Santana Stadium and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario Stadium at Caja Mágica). The system was developed by FoxTenn, a Spanish company located in Barcelona. It uses real images of the ball captured by 40 cameras located at ground level, synchronized with lasers and working at up to 3,000 images per second to determine whether it has bounced in or out of the court&#x27;s limits. This system was previously used at the 2020 Rio Open in Rio de Janeiro and at the 2021 MUSC Health Women&#x27;s Open in Charleston, South Carolina.

====Unification of rules====
Until March 2008, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA), Grand Slam Committee, and several individual tournaments had conflicting rules on how Hawk-Eye was to be utilised. A key example of this was the number of challenges a player was permitted per set, which varied among events. Some tournaments allowed players a greater margin for error, with players allowed an unlimited numbers of challenges over the course of a match. In other tournaments players received two or three per set. On 19 March 2008, the aforementioned organizing bodies announced a uniform system of rules: three unsuccessful challenges per set, with an additional challenge if the set reaches a tiebreak. In an advantage set (a set with no tiebreak) players are allowed three unsuccessful challenges every 12 games. The next scheduled event on the men and women&#x27;s tour, the 2008 Sony Ericsson Open, was the first event to implement these new, standardized rules.

====Replacement of human line judges====
Since 2021 the Australian Open has used Hawk-Eye to call lines in all games. The US Open replaced line judges with full electronic line calls in 2022. On 9 October 2024 the All-England Club announced that electronic line calling would replace human line judges full-time at Wimbledon starting in 2025.

===Football===
Hawk-Eye is one of the goal-line technology (GLT) systems authorised by FIFA. Hawk-Eye tracks the ball, and informs the referee if a ball fully crosses the goal line into the goal. The purpose of the system is to eliminate errors in assessing if a goal was scored. The Hawk-Eye system was one of the systems trialled by the sport&#x27;s governors prior to the 2012 change to the Laws of the Game that made GLT a permanent part of the game,&lt;ref name=&quot;March 2012 IFAB/FIFA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been used in various competitions since then. GLT is not compulsory and, owing to the cost of Hawk-Eye and its competitors, systems are only deployed in a few high-level competitions.

, licensed Hawk-Eye systems were installed at 96 stadiums. By number of installations, Hawk-Eye is the most popular GLT system. Hawk-Eye is the system used in the 
Premier League, Serie A and Bundesliga among other leagues.

===Snooker===

At the 2007 World Snooker Championship, the BBC used Hawk-Eye for the first time in its television coverage to show player views, particularly of potential snookers. It has also been used to demonstrate intended shots by players when the actual shot has gone awry. It is now used by the BBC at every World Championship, as well as some other major tournaments. The BBC used to use the system sporadically, for instance in the 2009 Masters at Wembley the Hawk-Eye was at most used once or twice per frame. Its usage has decreased significantly and is now only used within the World Championships and very rarely in any other tournament on the snooker tour. In contrast to tennis, Hawk-Eye is never used in snooker to assist referees&#x27; decisions and primarily used to assist viewers in showing what the player is facing.

===Gaelic games===
In Ireland, Hawk-Eye was introduced for all championship matches at Croke Park in Dublin in 2013. This followed consideration by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) for its use in Gaelic football and hurling. A trial took place at Croke Park on 2 April 2011. The double-header featured football between Dublin and Down and hurling between Dublin and Kilkenny. Over the previous two seasons there had been many calls for the technology to be adopted, especially from Kildare fans, who saw two high-profile decisions go against their team in important games. The GAA said it would review the issue after the 2013 Sam Maguire Cup was presented.

Hawk-Eye&#x27;s use was intended to eliminate contentious scores. Its first use in the championship came on Saturday 1 June 2013 for the Kildare v Offaly game, part of a double header with a second game of Dublin v Westmeath. Hawk-Eye determined that Offaly substitute Peter Cunningham&#x27;s attempted point had gone wide 10 minutes into the second half.

Use of Hawk-Eye was suspended during the 2013 All-Ireland SHC semi-finals on 18 August due to a human error during a minor (under-18) hurling game between Limerick and Galway. During the minor game, Hawk-Eye ruled a point for Limerick as a miss although the graphic showed the ball passing inside the posts, causing confusion around the stadium – the referee ultimately waved the valid point wide provoking anger from fans, viewers and TV analysts covering the game live. The system was subsequently stood down for the senior game which followed, owing to &quot;an inconsistency in the generation of a graphic&quot;. Limerick, who were narrowly defeated after extra-time, announced they would be appealing over Hawk-Eye&#x27;s costly failure. Hawk-Eye apologised for this incident and admitted that it was a result of human error. The incident drew attention from the UK, where Hawk-Eye had made its debut in English football&#x27;s Premier League the day before.

Hawk-Eye was introduced to a second venue, Semple Stadium, Thurles, in 2016. There is no TV screen at Semple: instead, an electronic screen displays a green &quot;Tá&quot; if a score has been made, and a red &quot;Níl&quot; if the shot is wide. It was used at a third venue, Páirc Uí Chaoimh, Cork, in July 2017, for the All-Ireland SHC quarter-finals between Clare versus Tipperary and Wexford versus Waterford.

Hawk-Eye was at the centre of several contentious decisions during the first half of the first 2022 All-Ireland SFC semi-final between Derry and Galway. This led to its suspension for the second half of that game, the referee being forced to alter the score and, later, Hawk-Eye&#x27;s suspension for the second All-Ireland SFC semi-final between Dublin and Kerry. The GAA confirmed on 15 July that Hawk-Eye would return for the All-Ireland SHC final, following comprehensive testing and a full review of the score detection technology.

Hawk-Eye malfunctioned again during the 2023 All-Ireland SFC quarter-final clash between Armagh and Monaghan after it returned a &quot;data unavailable&quot; message. The GAA requested an explanation from Hawk-Eye who concluded that the message was a result of operator error. The next day the GAA took the decision to stand down Hawk-Eye once again.

No official Irish-language term exists, although some publications have used the direct translation &quot;Súil an tSeabhaic&quot;.

===Australian football===
On 4 July 2013, the Australian Football League announced that they would be testing Hawk Eye technology to be used in the Score Review process. Hawk Eye was used for all matches played at the MCG during Round 15 of the 2013 AFL Season. The AFL also announced that Hawk Eye was only being tested, and would not be used in any Score Reviews during the round.

===Badminton===
BWF introduced Hawk-Eye technology in 2014 after testing other instant review technologies for line call decision in BWF major events. Hawk-Eye&#x27;s tracking cameras are also used to provide shuttlecock speed and other insight in badminton matches. Hawk-Eye was formally introduced in 2014 India Super Series tournament.

==Concerns about accuracy==
Hawk-Eye is now familiar to sport fans around the world for the views it brings into sports like cricket and tennis. Although this new technology has for the most part been embraced, it has received criticism from some quarters. In the 2007 Wimbledon Championships a shot that appeared to be out, was called by Hawk-Eye as in by 1mm, a distance smaller than the advertised mean error of . Some commentators have criticised the system&#x27;s statistical margin of error as too large. Others have noted that while is extraordinarily accurate, this margin of error is only for the witnessed trajectory of the ball. In 2008, an article in a peer-reviewed journal consolidated many of these doubts. The authors acknowledged the value of the system, but noted that it was probably fallible to some extent, and that its failure to depict a margin of error gave a spurious depiction of events. The authors also argued that the probable limits to its accuracy were not acknowledged by players, officials, commentators or spectators. They hypothesised that Hawk-Eye may struggle with predicting the trajectory of a cricket ball after bouncing: the time between a ball bouncing and striking the batsman may be too short to generate the three frames (at least) needed to plot a curve accurately.

==Use in computer games==
The use of the Hawk-Eye brand and simulation has been licensed to Codemasters for use in the video game &quot;Brian Lara International Cricket 2005&quot; to make the game appear more like television coverage, and subsequently in &quot;Brian Lara International Cricket 2007&quot;, &quot;Ashes Cricket 2009&quot; and &quot;International Cricket 2010&quot;. A similar version of the system has since been incorporated into the Xbox 360 version of &quot;Smash Court Tennis 3&quot;, but it is not present in the PSP version of the game, although it does feature a normal challenge of the ball which does not use the Hawk-Eye feature. It is also featured (Called Big Eye) in &quot;Don Bradman Cricket 14&quot; and &quot;Don Bradman Cricket 17&quot;.

==Competition==
Cyclops is a computer system which has been used on the ATP and WTA professional tennis tours as an electronic line judge since 1980, now superseded by Hawk-Eye at Grand Slam tournaments.

FoxTenn is another competing system for electronic line judge calling which uses real data to trace back ball path and marking, including on clay surfaces.

<text>Dennis Andrew Nilsen (23 November 1945 – 12 May 2018) was a Scottish serial killer and necrophile who murdered at least twelve young men and boys between 1978 and 1983. Convicted at the Old Bailey of six counts of murder and two of attempted murder, Nilsen was sentenced to life imprisonment on 4 November 1983, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 25 years; this recommendation was later changed to a whole life tariff in December 1994. In his later years, Nilsen was imprisoned at HM Prison Full Sutton in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

All of Nilsen&#x27;s murders were committed at the two north London addresses where he lived between 1978 and 1983. His victims would be lured to these addresses through deception and killed by strangulation, sometimes accompanied by drowning. Following each murder, Nilsen would perform a ritual in which he bathed and dressed the victim&#x27;s body, which he retained for extended periods of time, before dissecting and disposing of the remains by burning them in a bonfire or flushing them down a toilet.

Nilsen became known as the Muswell Hill Murderer, as he committed his later murders in the Muswell Hill district of north London. He died at York Hospital on 12 May 2018 of a pulmonary embolism and a retroperitoneal haemorrhage, which occurred following surgery to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Dennis Andrew Nilsen was born on 23 November 1945 in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, the second of three children born to Elizabeth Duthie Whyte and Olav Magnus Moksheim (who had adopted the surname Nilsen). Moksheim was a Norwegian soldier who had travelled to Scotland in 1940 as part of the Free Norwegian Forces following the German occupation of Norway. After a brief courtship, he married Elizabeth Whyte in May 1942. The newlyweds moved into her parents&#x27; house.

The marriage between Nilsen&#x27;s parents was difficult. His father did not view married life with any seriousness, being preoccupied with his duties with the Free Norwegian Forces and making little attempt to spend much time with or find a new home for his wife. After the birth of her third child, Nilsen&#x27;s mother concluded she had &quot;rushed into marriage without thinking&quot;. The couple divorced in 1948. All three of the couple&#x27;s children – Olav Jr., Dennis and Sylvia – had been conceived on their father&#x27;s brief visits to their mother&#x27;s household. Her parents, Andrew and Lily (née Duthie) Whyte – who had never approved of their daughter&#x27;s choice of husband – were supportive of their daughter following her divorce and considerate of their grandchildren.

Nilsen was a quiet yet adventurous child. His earliest memories were of family picnics in the Scottish countryside with his mother and siblings, of his grandparents&#x27; pious lifestyle (which he later described as &quot;cold and dour&quot;), and of being taken on long countryside walks carried on the shoulders of his maternal grandfather, to whom he was particularly close. Olav Jr. and Sylvia occasionally accompanied Nilsen and his grandfather on these walks. Despite only being five years old, Nilsen vividly recalled these walks as being &quot;very long ... along the harbour, across the wide stretch of beach, up to the sand-dunes, which rise thirty feet behind the beach ... and on to Inverallochy&quot;. He later described this stage of his childhood as one of contentment, and his grandfather being his &quot;great hero and protector&quot;, adding that whenever his grandfather (who was a fisherman) was at sea, &quot;life would be empty [for me] until he returned.&quot;

By 1951, Nilsen&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s health was in decline, but he continued to work. On 31 October 1951, while fishing in the North Sea, he died of a heart attack at the age of 62. His body was brought ashore and returned to the Whyte family home prior to burial. In what Nilsen later described as his most vivid childhood recollection, his mother, weeping, asked him whether he wanted to see his grandfather. When he replied that he did, he was taken into the room where his grandfather lay in an open coffin. As Nilsen gazed upon the body, his mother told him his grandfather was sleeping, adding that he had &quot;gone to a better place&quot;.

In the years following the death of his grandfather, Nilsen became more quiet and withdrawn, often standing alone at the harbour watching the herring boats. At home, he seldom participated in family activities and retreated from any attempts by adult family members to demonstrate affection towards him. Nilsen grew to resent what he saw as the unfair amount of attention his mother, grandmother and, later, stepfather displayed towards his older brother and younger sister. Nilsen envied Olav Jr.&#x27;s popularity. He often talked to or played games with his younger sister Sylvia, to whom he was closer than any other family member following his grandfather&#x27;s passing.

On one of his solo excursions to the beach at Inverallochy, in 1954 or 1955, Nilsen became submerged beneath the water and was almost dragged out to sea. He initially panicked, flailing his arms and shouting. As he &quot;gasped for air which wasn&#x27;t there&quot;, he recalled believing that his grandfather was about to arrive and pull him out before experiencing a sense of tranquillity. His life was saved by another youth who dragged him ashore. Shortly after this incident, Nilsen&#x27;s mother moved out of his grandparents&#x27; home and into a flat with her three children. She later married a builder named Andrew Scott, with whom she had four more children in as many years. Although Nilsen initially resented his stepfather (whom he viewed as an unfair disciplinarian) he gradually came to grudgingly respect him. The family moved to Strichen in 1955.

At the onset of puberty, Nilsen discovered he was gay, which initially confused and shamed him. He kept his sexuality hidden from his family and his few friends. Because many of the boys to whom he was attracted had facial features similar to those of his younger sister Sylvia, on one occasion he sexually fondled her, believing that his attraction towards boys might be a manifestation of the care he felt for her. Nilsen made no efforts to seek sexual contact with any of the peers to whom he was sexually attracted, although he later said he had been fondled by an older youth and did not find the experience unpleasant. On one occasion, he also caressed and fondled the body of his older brother as he slept. As a result of this, Olav Jr. began to suspect his brother was gay and regularly belittled him in public – referring to him as &quot;hen&quot; (Scottish slang for &quot;girl&quot;). Nilsen initially believed that his fondling of his sister may have been evidence that he was bisexual.

As Nilsen progressed into adolescence, he found life in Strichen increasingly stifling, with limited entertainment amenities or career opportunities. He respected his parents&#x27; efforts to provide and care for their children, but began to resent the fact that his family was poorer than most of his peers, with his mother and stepfather making no effort to better their lifestyles; thus, Nilsen seldom invited his friends to the family home. At the age of 14, he joined the Army Cadet Force, viewing the British Army as a potential avenue for escaping his rural origins.

===Army service===
Nilsen&#x27;s scholastic record was above average. He displayed a flair for history and art but shunned sports. He finished his schooling in 1961 and briefly worked in a canning factory as he considered which career path he should choose. After three weeks at the factory, Nilsen informed his mother that he intended to join the army and receive training as a chef. Nilsen passed the entrance examinations and received official notification he was to enlist for nine years&#x27; service in September 1961, commencing his training with the Army Catering Corps at St. Omer Barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire. Within weeks, Nilsen began to excel in his army duties; he later described his three years of training at Aldershot as &quot;the happiest of my life&quot;. He relished the travel opportunities afforded him in his training and recalled as a highlight his regiment taking part in a ceremonial parade attended by both the Queen and Field Marshal Lord Montgomery of Alamein.

While stationed at Aldershot, Nilsen&#x27;s latent feelings began to stir, but he kept his sexual orientation well hidden from his colleagues. Nilsen never showered in the company of his fellow soldiers for fear of developing an erection in their presence; instead opting to bathe alone in the bathroom, which also afforded him the privacy to masturbate without discovery.

In mid-1964, Nilsen passed his initial catering exam and was officially assigned to the 1st Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers in Osnabrück, West Germany, where he served as a private. In this deployment, Nilsen began to increase his intake of alcohol. He described himself and his colleagues as a &quot;hard-working, boozy lot&quot;; his colleagues recalled he often drank to excess in order to ease his shyness. On one occasion, Nilsen and a German youth drank themselves into a stupor. When Nilsen awoke, he found himself on the floor of the German youth&#x27;s flat. No sexual activity had occurred, but this incident fuelled Nilsen&#x27;s sexual fantasies, which initially involved his sexual partner – invariably a young, slender male – being completely passive. These fantasies gradually evolved into his partner being unconscious or dead. On several occasions, Nilsen also made tentative efforts to have his own prone body sexually interfered with by one of his colleagues. In these instances, whenever he and his colleagues drank to excess, Nilsen would pretend he was inebriated in the hope one of his colleagues would make sexual use of his supposedly unconscious body.

Following two years of service in Osnabrück, Nilsen returned to Aldershot, where he passed his official catering exam before being deployed to serve as a cook for the British Army in Norway. In 1967, he was deployed to the State of Aden (formerly Aden Colony, now part of Yemen), where he again served as a cook at the Al Mansoura Prison. This posting was more dangerous than his previous postings in West Germany or Norway, and Nilsen later recalled his regiment losing several men, often in ambushes en route to the army barracks. Nilsen was kidnapped by an Arab taxi driver, who beat him unconscious and placed him in the boot of his car. Upon being dragged out of the boot, Nilsen grabbed a jack handle and knocked the taxi driver to the ground before beating him unconscious. He then locked the man in the boot of the taxi.

Unlike his previous postings, Nilsen had his own room while stationed in Aden. This afforded him the privacy to masturbate without discovery. His developed fantasies of sex with an unresistant or deceased partner unfulfilled, Nilsen compensated by imagining sexual encounters with an unconscious body as he masturbated while looking at his own prone, nude body in a mirror. On one occasion, Nilsen discovered that, by using a free-standing mirror, he could create an effect whereby if positioning the mirror so his head was out of view, he could visualise himself engaged in a sexual act with another man. To Nilsen, this ruse created the ideal circumstance in which he could visually &quot;split&quot; his personality: in these masturbatory fantasies, Nilsen alternately envisaged himself as being both the domineering and the passive partner. These fantasies gradually evolved to incorporate his own near-death experience with the Arab taxi driver; the dead bodies he had seen in Aden; and imagery within a 19th-century oil painting entitled &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;, which depicts an old man holding the limp, nude body of a dead youth as he sits aside the dismembered body of another young male. In Nilsen&#x27;s most vividly recalled fantasy, a slender, attractive young blond soldier who had been recently killed in battle is dominated by a faceless &quot;dirty, grey-haired old man&quot; who washed this body before engaging in intercourse with the spreadeagled corpse.
When Nilsen completed his deployment in Aden, he returned to the UK and was assigned to serve with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders at Seaton Barracks in Plymouth, Devon. Throughout his service with this regiment, he was required to cook for thirty soldiers and two officers on a daily basis. Nilsen served at these barracks for one year before being transferred with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to Cyprus in 1969. Months later, the regiment was transferred to West Berlin, where, the same year, Nilsen had his first sexual experience with a woman: a prostitute whose services he solicited. He bragged of this sexual encounter to his colleagues but later stated he found intercourse with a female both &quot;over-rated&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;.

Following a brief period with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Inverness, Nilsen was selected to cook for the Queen&#x27;s Royal Guard before, in January 1971, being reassigned to serve as a cook for a different regiment in the Shetland Islands, where he ended his 11-year military career at the rank of corporal in October 1972.

Between October and December 1972, Nilsen lived with his family as he considered his next career move. On more than one occasion in the three months Nilsen lived in Strichen, his mother voiced her opinion as to her being more concerned with his lack of female companionship than his career path, and of her desire to see him marry and start a family. On one occasion, Nilsen joined his older brother Olav Jr., his sister-in-law, and another couple to watch a documentary about gay men. All present viewed the topic with derision, except Nilsen, who ardently spoke in defence of gay rights. A fight ensued, after which Olav Jr. informed his mother that Nilsen was gay. Nilsen never spoke to his older brother again and maintained only sporadic written contact with his mother, stepfather, and younger siblings. He decided to join the Metropolitan Police, and moved to London in December to begin the training course.

==Move to London==
===Employment===
In April 1973, Nilsen completed his police training and was posted to Willesden Green. Still a cadet and junior constable, he performed several arrests but never had to physically subdue a member of the public. Nilsen enjoyed the work but missed the comradeship of the army. He began to drink alone in the evenings. During the summer and autumn of 1973, Nilsen began frequenting gay pubs and engaged in several casual liaisons with men. He viewed these encounters as &quot;soul-destroying&quot; liaisons in which he &quot;would only lend&quot; his partner his body in a &quot;vain search for inner peace&quot; as he sought a lasting relationship. In August, following a failed relationship, Nilsen came to the conclusion that his personal lifestyle was at odds with his job. His birth father died in Ghana the same month, leaving each of his three children £1,000 (the equivalent of about £10,600 as of 2025). In December, Nilsen resigned from the police.

Between December 1973 and May 1974, Nilsen worked as a security guard. The work was intermittent, and he resolved to find more stable, secure employment. He found work as a civil servant in May 1974. Nilsen was initially posted to a Jobcentre in Denmark Street, where his primary role was to find employment for unskilled labourers. At his workplace, Nilsen was known to be a quiet, conscientious employee who was active in the trade union movement. His attendance record was mediocre, although he frequently volunteered to work overtime, leading several colleagues to suspect he was something of a loner. In 1979, Nilsen was appointed acting executive officer. He was officially promoted to the position of executive officer, with additional supervisory responsibilities, in June 1982, and transferred to another Jobcentre in Kentish Town, continuing in this job until his arrest.

===Melrose Avenue===
In November 1975, Nilsen encountered a 20-year-old man named David Gallichan being threatened outside a pub by two other men. Nilsen intervened in the altercation and took Gallichan to his room at 80 Teignmouth Road in the Cricklewood district of north London. The two men spent the evening drinking and talking; Nilsen learned that Gallichan had recently moved to London from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, was gay, unemployed, and residing in a hostel. The following morning, both men agreed to live together in a larger residence and Nilsen – using part of the inheritance bequeathed to him by his father – immediately resolved to find a larger property. Several days later, the pair viewed a vacant ground-floor flat at 195 Melrose Avenue, also in Cricklewood, and they decided to move into the property. Prior to moving into Melrose Avenue, Nilsen negotiated a deal with the landlord whereby he and Gallichan had exclusive use of the garden at the rear of the property.

The Melrose Avenue flat was supposed to be furnished, but upon moving in the pair found it to be largely threadbare. Over the following months, the couple redecorated and furnished the entire flat. Much of this work was performed by Gallichan, as Nilsen – having discovered Gallichan&#x27;s lack of employment ambitions – began to view himself as the breadwinner in their relationship. Nilsen later recollected that he was sexually attracted to Gallichan, but the pair seldom had intercourse.

Initially, Nilsen experienced domestic contentment with Gallichan, but within a year of their moving to Melrose Avenue, the superficial relationship between the two men began to show signs of strain. They slept in separate beds, and both began to bring home casual sexual partners. Gallichan later insisted Nilsen had never been physically violent towards him, but that he did engage in verbal abuse, and the pair had begun arguing with increasing frequency by early 1976. Nilsen later stated that, following a heated argument in May 1977, he demanded Gallichan leave the residence. (Gallichan later informed investigators that he had chosen to end the relationship.)

Nilsen formed brief relationships with several other young men over the following eighteen months; none of these relationships lasted more than a few weeks, and none of the men expressed any intention of living with him on a permanent basis. By late 1978, he was living a solitary existence; he had experienced at least three failed relationships in the previous eighteen months, and he later confessed to having developed an increasing conviction that he was unfit to live with. Throughout 1978, he devoted an ever-increasing amount of his time, effort, and assiduity to his work, and he spent most evenings consuming spirits and/or lager as he listened to music.

==Murders==
Between 1978 and 1983, Nilsen is known to have killed a minimum of twelve men and boys and to have attempted to kill seven others (he initially confessed in 1983 to having killed about sixteen victims). The majority of Nilsen&#x27;s victims were homeless or gay men; others were heterosexual people he typically met in bars, on public transport or – on one occasion – outside his own home. All of Nilsen&#x27;s murders were committed inside the two north London addresses where he resided in the years he is known to have killed. His victims were lured to these addresses through guile – typically the offer of alcohol and/or shelter.

Inside Nilsen&#x27;s home, the victims were usually given food and alcohol, then strangled – typically with a ligature – either to death or until they had become unconscious. If the victim had been strangled into unconsciousness, Nilsen then drowned him in his bathtub, his sink, or a bucket of water before observing a ritual in which he bathed, clothed, and retained the bodies inside his residences for several weeks or, occasionally, months before he dismembered them. Each victim killed between 1978 and 1981 at his Cricklewood residence was disposed of via burning upon a bonfire. Prior to their dissection, Nilsen removed their internal organs, which he disposed of either beside a fence behind his flat or close to Gladstone Park. The victims killed in 1982 and 1983 at his Muswell Hill residence were retained at his flat, with their flesh and smaller bones flushed down the lavatory.

Nilsen admitted to engaging in masturbation as he viewed the nude bodies of several of his victims, and to have engaged in sexual acts with six of his victims&#x27; bodies, but was adamant that he had never penetrated any of his victims.

===195 Melrose Avenue===
Nilsen killed his first victim, 14-year-old Stephen Holmes, on 30 December 1978. Holmes encountered Nilsen in the Cricklewood Arms pub, where Holmes had unsuccessfully attempted to purchase alcohol. According to Nilsen, he had been drinking heavily alone on the day he met Holmes before deciding in the evening that he must &quot;at all costs&quot; leave his flat and seek company. Nilsen invited Holmes to his house with the promise of the two drinking alcohol and listening to music, believing him to be approximately 17 years old. At Nilsen&#x27;s home, both he and Holmes drank heavily before they fell asleep. The following morning, Nilsen awoke to find the sleeping Holmes beside him on his bed. In his subsequent written confessions, Nilsen stated he was &quot;afraid to wake him in case he left me&quot;. After caressing the sleeping youth, Nilsen decided Holmes was to &quot;stay with me over the New Year whether he wanted to or not&quot;. Reaching for a necktie, Nilsen straddled Holmes as he strangled him into unconsciousness, before drowning the teenager in a bucket filled with water. Nilsen then washed the body in his bathtub before placing Holmes on his bed and caressing his body. He twice masturbated over the body, before awaiting the passing of rigor mortis to enable him to stow the corpse beneath his floorboards. Holmes&#x27; bound corpse remained beneath the floorboards for almost eight months, before Nilsen built a bonfire in the garden behind his flat and burned the body on 11 August 1979.

Reflecting on his killing spree in 1983, Nilsen stated that, having killed Holmes, &quot;I caused dreams which caused death ... this is my crime&quot;, adding that he had &quot;started down the avenue of death and possession of a new kind of flatmate&quot;.

On 11 October 1979, Nilsen attempted to murder a student from Hong Kong named Andrew Ho, whom he had met in a St Martin&#x27;s Lane pub and lured to his flat on the promise of sex. Nilsen attempted to strangle Ho, who managed to flee from his flat and reported the incident to police. Nilsen was questioned in relation to the incident, but Ho decided not to press charges.

Two months after the attempted murder of Ho, on 3 December 1979, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old Canadian student named Kenneth Ockenden, who had been on a tour of England visiting relatives. Nilsen encountered Ockenden as they both drank in a West End pub. Upon learning the young man was a tourist, Nilsen offered to show Ockenden several London landmarks, an offer which Ockenden accepted. Nilsen then invited the student to his house on the promise of a meal and further drinks. The pair stopped at an off licence en route to Nilsen&#x27;s residence and purchased whisky, rum, and beer, with Ockenden insisting on sharing the bill. Nilsen was adamant he could not recall the precise moment he strangled Ockenden but recalled that he strangled the young man with the cord of his (Nilsen&#x27;s) headphones as Ockenden listened to music. He also recalled dragging Ockenden across his floor with the wire wrapped around his neck as he strangled him, before pouring himself half a glass of rum and continuing to listen to music on the headphones with which he had strangled Ockenden.

The following day, Nilsen purchased a Polaroid camera and photographed Ockenden&#x27;s body in various suggestive positions. He then laid Ockenden&#x27;s corpse spreadeagled above him on his bed as he watched television for several hours before wrapping the body in plastic bags and stowing the corpse beneath the floorboards. On approximately four occasions over the following fortnight, Nilsen disinterred Ockenden&#x27;s body from beneath his floorboards and seated the body upon his armchair alongside him as he himself watched television and drank alcohol.

Nilsen killed his third victim, 16-year-old Martyn Duffey, on 17 May 1980. Duffey was a catering student from Birkenhead, Merseyside, who had hitchhiked to London without his parents&#x27; knowledge on 13 May after being questioned by the British Transport Police for evading his train fare. For four days, Duffey had slept rough near Euston railway station before Nilsen encountered the youth as he returned from a union conference in Southport. Duffey, Nilsen recollected, was both exhausted and hungry, and happily accepted Nilsen&#x27;s offer of a meal and a bed for the evening. After the youth had fallen asleep in Nilsen&#x27;s bed, Nilsen fashioned a ligature around his neck, then simultaneously sat on Duffey&#x27;s chest and tightened the ligature with a &quot;great force&quot;. Nilsen held this grip until Duffey became unconscious; he then dragged the youth into his kitchen and drowned him in his sink before bathing with the body – which he recollected as being &quot;the youngest-looking I had ever seen.&quot;

Duffey&#x27;s body was first placed upon a kitchen chair, then upon the bed on which he had been strangled. The body was repeatedly kissed, complimented, and caressed by Nilsen, both before and after he had masturbated while sitting upon the stomach of the corpse. For two days, Duffey&#x27;s body was stowed in a cupboard, before Nilsen noted signs of bloating; therefore, &quot;he went straight under the floorboards&quot;.

Following Duffey&#x27;s murder, Nilsen began to kill with increasing frequency. Before the end of 1980, he killed a further five victims and attempted to murder one other; only one of these victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen&#x27;s recollections of the unidentified victims were vague, but he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, then spitting at his own image as he looked at himself in the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; before bursting into tears.

Inevitably, the accumulated bodies beneath Nilsen&#x27;s floorboards attracted insects and created a foul odour – particularly throughout the summer months. On occasions when Nilsen disinterred victims from beneath the floorboards, he noted that the bodies were covered with pupae and infested with maggots; some victims&#x27; heads had maggots crawling out of eye sockets and mouths. He placed deodorants beneath the floorboards and sprayed insecticide about the flat twice daily, but the odour of decay and the presence of flies remained.

In late 1980, Nilsen removed and dissected the bodies of each victim killed since December 1979 and burned them upon a communal bonfire he had constructed on waste ground behind his flat. To disguise the smell of the burning flesh of the six dissected bodies placed upon this pyre, Nilsen crowned the bonfire with an old car tyre. Three neighbourhood children stood to watch this particular bonfire, and Nilsen later wrote in his memoirs that he felt it would have seemed &quot;in order&quot; if he had seen these three children &quot;dancing around a mass funeral pyre&quot;. When the bonfire had been reduced to ashes and cinders, Nilsen used a rake to search the debris for any recognisable bones. Noting a skull was still intact, he smashed it to pieces with his rake.

On or about 4 January 1981, Nilsen encountered an unidentified man whom he described to investigators as an &quot;18-year-old, blue-eyed&quot; young Scot at the Golden Lion pub in Soho; he was lured to Melrose Avenue upon the promise of partaking in a drinking contest. After Nilsen and this victim had consumed several beverages, Nilsen strangled him with a tie and subsequently placed the body beneath the floorboards. Nilsen is known to have informed his employers he was ill and unable to attend work on 12 January in order that he could dissect both this victim and another unidentified victim he had killed approximately one month earlier. By April, Nilsen had killed two further unidentified victims: one of whom he described as an English skinhead whom he had met in Leicester Square; the other he described as &quot;Belfast boy&quot;; a man in his early 20s, approximately height, whom he had murdered sometime in February. In relation to the first of these three unidentified victims, he later casually reflected: &quot;End of the day, end of the drink, end of a person ... floorboards back, carpet replaced, and back to work at Denmark Street&quot;. The following month, Nilsen removed the internal organs of several victims stowed beneath his floorboards. He discarded these innards both upon the waste ground behind his flat and in his household rubbish.

The final victim to be murdered at Melrose Avenue was 23-year-old Malcolm Barlow, whom Nilsen discovered slumped against a wall outside his home on 17 September 1981. When Nilsen enquired as to Barlow&#x27;s welfare, he was informed the medication Barlow was prescribed for his epilepsy had caused his legs to weaken. Nilsen suggested that Barlow should be in hospital and, supporting him, walked him into his residence before phoning for an ambulance. The following day, Barlow was released from hospital and returned to Nilsen&#x27;s home, apparently to thank him. He was invited in and, after eating a meal, began drinking rum and coke before falling asleep on the sofa. Nilsen manually strangled Barlow as he slept, before stowing his body beneath his kitchen sink the following morning.

In mid-1981, Nilsen&#x27;s landlord decided to renovate 195 Melrose Avenue, and asked Nilsen to vacate the property. Nilsen was initially resistant to the proposal but accepted an offer of £1,000 from the landlord to vacate the residence. He moved into an attic flat at 23D Cranley Gardens in the Muswell Hill district of north London on 5 October 1981. The day before he vacated the property, Nilsen burned the dissected bodies of the last five victims he had killed at this address upon a third and final bonfire he constructed in the garden behind his flat. Again, Nilsen ensured the bonfire was crowned with an old car tyre to disguise the smell of burning flesh (Nilsen had already dissected the bodies of four of these victims in January and August, and needed only to complete the dissection of Barlow for this third bonfire).

===23 Cranley Gardens===
At 23 Cranley Gardens, Nilsen had no access to a garden, and as he resided in an attic flat, he was unable to stow any bodies beneath his floorboards. For almost two months, any acquaintances Nilsen encountered and lured to his flat were not assaulted in any manner, although he did attempt to strangle a 19-year-old student named Paul Nobbs on 23 November 1981, but stopped himself from completing the act.

In March 1982, Nilsen encountered 23-year-old John Howlett while drinking in a pub near Leicester Square. Howlett was lured to Nilsen&#x27;s flat on the promise of continuing drinking with Nilsen. There, both Nilsen and Howlett drank as they watched a film before Howlett walked into Nilsen&#x27;s front room and fell asleep in his bed (which was located in the front room at this time). One hour later, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to rouse Howlett, then sat on the edge of the bed drinking rum as he stared at Howlett before deciding to kill him. Following a ferocious struggle (in which Howlett himself attempted to strangle his attacker), Nilsen strangled Howlett into unconsciousness with an upholstery strap before returning to his living room, shaking from the &quot;stress of the struggle&quot; in which he had believed he would be overpowered. On three occasions over the following ten minutes, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to kill this victim after noting he had resumed breathing, before deciding to fill his bathtub with water and drown him. For over a week following Howlett&#x27;s murder, Nilsen&#x27;s own neck bore the victim&#x27;s finger impressions.
In May 1982, Nilsen encountered Carl Stottor, a 21-year-old gay man, as the young man drank at the Black Cap pub in Camden. Nilsen engaged Stottor in conversation, discovering he was depressed following a failed relationship. After plying him with alcohol, Nilsen invited Stottor to his flat, assuring his guest he had no intention of sexual activity. At the flat, Stottor consumed further alcohol before falling asleep upon an open sleeping bag; he later awoke to find himself being strangled with Nilsen loudly whispering, &quot;Stay still&quot;.

In his subsequent testimony at Nilsen&#x27;s trial, Stottor stated he initially believed Nilsen was trying to free him from the zip of the sleeping bag, before he returned to a state of unconsciousness. He then vaguely recalled hearing &quot;water running&quot; before realising he was immersed in the water and that Nilsen was attempting to drown him. After briefly succeeding in raising his head above the water, Stottor gasped, &quot;No more, please! No more!&quot; before Nilsen again submerged Stottor&#x27;s head beneath the water. Believing he had killed Stottor, Nilsen seated him in his armchair, then noted his mongrel dog, Bleep, licking Stottor&#x27;s face. Nilsen realised he was still barely alive. He rubbed Stottor&#x27;s limbs and heart to increase circulation, covered his body in blankets, and then laid him upon his bed. When Stottor regained consciousness, Nilsen embraced him; he then explained to Stottor he had almost strangled himself on the zip of the sleeping bag, and that he had resuscitated him.

Over the following two days, Stottor repeatedly lapsed in and out of consciousness. When Stottor had regained enough strength to question Nilsen as to his recollections of being strangled and immersed in cold water, Nilsen explained he had become caught in the zip of the sleeping bag following a nightmare, and that he had placed him in cold water as &quot;you were in shock&quot;. Nilsen then led Stottor to a nearby railway station, where he informed the young man he hoped they might meet again before he bade him farewell.

Three months after Nilsen&#x27;s June 1982 promotion to the position of executive officer in his employment, he encountered a 27-year-old named Graham Allen attempting to hail a taxi in Shaftesbury Avenue. Allen accepted Nilsen&#x27;s offer to accompany him to Cranley Gardens for a meal. As had been the case with several previous victims, Nilsen stated he could not recall the precise moment he had strangled Allen, but recalled approaching him as he sat eating an omelette with the full intention of murdering him. Allen&#x27;s body was retained in the bathtub for a total of three days before Nilsen began the task of dissecting his body upon the kitchen floor. Nilsen is again known to have informed his employers he was ill and unable to attend work on 9 October 1982 – likely in order that he could complete the dissection of Allen&#x27;s body.

On 26 January 1983, Nilsen killed his final victim, 20-year-old Stephen Sinclair. Sinclair was last seen by acquaintances in the company of Nilsen, walking in the direction of a tube station. At Nilsen&#x27;s flat, Sinclair fell asleep in a drug- and alcohol-induced stupor in an armchair as Nilsen sat listening to the rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;. Nilsen approached Sinclair, knelt before him and said to himself, &quot;Oh Stephen, here I go again&quot;, before strangling Sinclair with a ligature constructed with a necktie and a rope. Noting crepe bandages upon each of Sinclair&#x27;s wrists, Nilsen removed these to discover several deep slash marks from where Sinclair had recently tried to kill himself.

Following his usual ritual of bathing the body, Nilsen laid Sinclair&#x27;s body upon his bed, applied talcum powder to the body, and then arranged three mirrors around the bed before himself lying naked alongside the dead man. Several hours later, he turned Stephen&#x27;s head towards him, before kissing his body on the forehead and saying, &quot;Goodnight, Stephen&quot;. Nilsen then fell asleep alongside the body. As had been the case with both Howlett and Allen, Sinclair&#x27;s body was subsequently dissected, with various dismembered parts wrapped in plastic bags and stored in either a wardrobe, a tea chest, or within a drawer located beneath the bathtub. The bags used to hold Sinclair&#x27;s remains were sealed with the same crepe bandages Nilsen had found upon Sinclair&#x27;s wrists. Nilsen attempted to dispose of the flesh, internal organs and smaller bones of all three victims killed at Cranley Gardens by flushing their dissected remains down his toilet. In a practice which he had conducted upon several victims killed at Melrose Avenue, he also boiled the heads, hands and feet to remove the flesh off these sections of the victims&#x27; bodies.

On 4 February 1983, Nilsen wrote a letter to estate agents complaining that the drains at Cranley Gardens were blocked and that the situation for both himself and the other tenants at the property was intolerable. The following day, he refused to allow an acquaintance to enter his property, the reason being he had begun to dismember Sinclair&#x27;s body on the floor of his kitchen.

==Discovery and arrest==
Nilsen&#x27;s murders were first discovered by a Dyno-Rod employee, Michael Cattran, who responded to the plumbing complaints made by both Nilsen and other tenants of Cranley Gardens on 8 February 1983. Opening a drain cover at the side of the house, Cattran discovered the drain was packed with a flesh-like substance and numerous small bones of unknown origin. Cattran reported his suspicions to his supervisor, Gary Wheeler. As Cattran had arrived at the property at dusk, he and Wheeler agreed to postpone further investigation into the blockage until the following morning. Prior to leaving the property, Nilsen and fellow tenant Jim Allcock convened with Cattran to discuss the source of the substance. Upon hearing Cattran exclaim how similar the substance was in appearance to human flesh, Nilsen replied: &quot;It looks to me like someone has been flushing down their Kentucky Fried Chicken.&quot;

At 7:30a.m. the following day, Cattran and Wheeler returned to Cranley Gardens, by which time the drain had been cleared. This aroused the suspicions of both men. Cattran discovered some scraps of flesh and four bones in a pipe leading from the drain which linked to the top flat of the house. To both Cattran and Wheeler, the bones looked as if they originated from a human hand. Both men immediately called the police who, upon closer inspection, discovered further small bones and scraps of what looked to the naked eye like either human or animal flesh in the same pipe. These remains were taken to the mortuary at Hornsey, where pathologist David Bowen advised police that the remains were human, and that one particular piece of flesh he concluded had been from a human neck bore a ligature mark.

Upon learning from fellow tenants that the top floor flat from where the human remains had been flushed belonged to Nilsen, Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay and two colleagues opted to wait outside the house until Nilsen returned home from work. When Nilsen arrived, DCI Jay introduced himself and his colleagues, explaining they had come to enquire about the blockage in the drains from his flat. Nilsen asked why the police were interested in his drains and also whether or not the two officers present with Jay were health inspectors. In response, Jay informed Nilsen that the other two were also police officers, and requested access to his flat to discuss the matter further.

The three officers followed Nilsen into his flat, where they immediately noted the odour of rotting flesh. Nilsen questioned further as to why the police were interested in his drains, to which he was informed the blockage had been caused by human remains. Nilsen feigned shock and bewilderment, stating, &quot;Good grief, how awful!&quot; In response, Jay replied: &quot;Don&#x27;t mess about, where&#x27;s the rest of the body?&quot; Nilsen responded calmly, admitting that the remainder of the body could be found in two plastic bags in a nearby wardrobe, from which DCI Jay and his colleagues noted the overpowering smell of decomposition emanated. The officers did not open the cupboard but asked Nilsen whether there were any other body parts to be found, to which Nilsen replied: &quot;It&#x27;s a long story; it goes back a long time. I&#x27;ll tell you everything. I want to get it off my chest. Not here – at the police station.&quot; He was then arrested and cautioned on suspicion of murder before being taken to Hornsey police station. While en route to the police station, Nilsen was asked whether the remains in his flat belonged to one person or two. Staring out of the window of the police car, he replied, &quot;Fifteen or sixteen, since 1978.&quot;

That evening, Detective Superintendent Chambers accompanied DCI Jay and Bowen to Cranley Gardens, where the plastic bags were removed from the wardrobe and taken to Hornsey mortuary. One bag was found to contain two dissected torsos, one of which had been vertically dissected, and a shopping bag containing various internal organs. The second bag contained a human skull almost completely devoid of flesh, a severed head, and a torso with arms attached, but hands missing. Both heads were found to have been subjected to moist heat.

===Confession===
In an interview conducted on 10 February, Nilsen confessed there were further human remains stowed in a tea chest in his living room, with other remains inside an upturned drawer in his bathroom. The dismembered body parts were the bodies of three men, all of whom he had killed by strangulation – usually with a necktie. One victim he could not name; another he knew only as &quot;John the Guardsman&quot;, and the third he identified as Stephen Sinclair. He also stated that, beginning in December 1978, he had killed &quot;twelve or thirteen&quot; men at his former address, 195 Melrose Avenue. Nilsen also admitted to having unsuccessfully attempted to kill approximately seven other people, who had either escaped or, on one occasion, had been at the brink of death but had been revived and allowed to leave his residence.

A further search for additional remains at Cranley Gardens on 10 February revealed the lower section of a torso and two legs stowed in a bag in the bathroom, and a skull, a section of a torso, and various bones in the tea chest. The same day, Nilsen accompanied police to Melrose Avenue, where he indicated the three locations in the rear garden where he had burned the remains of his victims.

Cattran contacted the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; on 10 February, informing the newspaper of the ongoing search for human remains at Cranley Gardens, leading the newspaper to break the story and spark intense national media interest. By 11 February, reporters from the &quot;Mirror&quot; had obtained photographs from Nilsen&#x27;s mother in Aberdeenshire, which appeared on their front page the following day.
Under English law, the police had forty-eight hours in which to charge Nilsen or release him. Assembling the remains of the victims killed at Cranley Gardens on the floor of Hornsey mortuary, Professor Bowen was able to confirm the fingerprints on one body matched those on police files of Sinclair. At 5:40p.m. on 11 February, Nilsen was charged with Sinclair&#x27;s murder, and a statement revealing this was released to the press. Formal questioning of Nilsen began the same evening, with Nilsen agreeing to be represented by a solicitor (a facility he had earlier declined). Police interviewed Nilsen on sixteen separate occasions over the following days, in interviews which totalled over thirty hours.

Nilsen was adamant that he was uncertain as to why he had killed, simply saying, &quot;I&#x27;m hoping you will tell me that&quot; when asked his motive for the murders. He was adamant that the decision to kill was not made until moments before the act of murder. Most victims had died by strangulation; on several occasions, he had drowned the victims once they had been strangled into unconsciousness. Once the victim had been killed, he typically bathed the victim&#x27;s body, shaved any hair from the torso to conform it to his physical ideal, then applied makeup to any obvious blemishes upon the skin. The body was usually dressed in socks and underpants, before Nilsen draped the victims around him as he talked to the corpse. With most victims, Nilsen masturbated as he stood alongside or knelt above the body, and Nilsen confessed to having occasionally engaged in intercrural sex with his victims&#x27; bodies, but repeatedly stressed to investigators he had never actually penetrated his victims – explaining that his victims were &quot;too perfect and beautiful for the pathetic ritual of commonplace sex&quot;.

All the victims&#x27; personal possessions were destroyed following the ritual of bathing their bodies in an effort to obliterate their identity prior to their murder and their now becoming what Nilsen described as a &quot;prop&quot; in his fantasies. In several instances, he talked to the victim&#x27;s body as it remained seated in a chair or prone on his bed, and he recalled being emotional as he marvelled at the beauty of their bodies. With reference to one victim, Kenneth Ockenden, Nilsen noted that Ockenden&#x27;s &quot;body and skin were very beautiful&quot;, adding the sight &quot;almost brought me to tears&quot;. Another, unidentified victim had been so emaciated that he had simply been discarded under the floorboards.

The bodies of the victims killed at his previous address were kept for as long as decomposition would allow: upon noting any major signs of decomposition in a body, Nilsen stowed it beneath his floorboards. If a body did not display any signs of decomposition, he occasionally alternately stowed it beneath the floorboards and retrieved it before again masturbating as he stood over or lay alongside the body. Make-up was again applied to &quot;enhance its appearance&quot; and to obscure blemishes.

When questioned as to why the heads found at Cranley Gardens had been subjected to moist heat, Nilsen stated that he had frequently boiled the heads of his victims in a large cooking pot on his stove so that the internal contents evaporated, thus removing the need to dispose of the brain and flesh. The torsos and limbs of the three victims killed at this address were dissected within about one week of their murder before being wrapped in plastic bags and stowed in the three locations he had indicated to police; the internal organs and smaller bones he flushed down the toilet. This practice – which had led to his arrest – had been the only method he could consider to dispose of the internal organs and soft tissue as, unlike at Melrose Avenue, he had no exclusive use of the garden of the property.

At Melrose Avenue, Nilsen typically retained the victims&#x27; bodies for a much longer period before disposing of the remains. He kept &quot;three or four&quot; bodies stowed beneath the floorboards before he dissected the remains, which he would wrap inside plastic bags and either return under the floorboards or, in two instances, place inside suitcases which had been left at the property by a previous tenant. The remains stowed inside suitcases – those of Ockenden and Duffey – were placed inside a shed in the rear garden, and were disposed of upon the second bonfire Nilsen had constructed at Melrose Avenue. Other dissected remains – minus the internal organs – were returned beneath the floorboards or placed upon a bonfire he had constructed in the garden.

Nilsen confirmed that on four occasions, he had removed the accumulated bodies from beneath his floorboards and dissected the remains, and on three of these occasions, he had then disposed of the accumulated remains upon an assembled bonfire. On more than one occasion, he had removed the internal organs from the victims&#x27; bodies and placed them in bags, which he then typically dumped behind a fence to be eaten by wildlife. All the bodies of the victims killed at Melrose Avenue were dismembered after several weeks or months of interment beneath the floorboards. Nilsen recalled that the putrefaction of these victims&#x27; bodies made this task exceedingly vile; he recalled having to fortify his nerves with whisky and having to grab handfuls of salt with which to brush aside maggots from the remains. Often, he vomited as he dissected the bodies, before wrapping the dismembered limbs inside plastic bags and carrying the remains to the bonfires. Nonetheless, immediately prior to his dissecting the victims&#x27; bodies, Nilsen masturbated as he knelt or sat alongside the corpse. This, he stated, was his symbolic gesture of saying goodbye to his victims.

When questioned as to whether he had any remorse for his crimes, Nilsen replied: &quot;I wished I could stop, but I couldn&#x27;t. I had no other thrill or happiness&quot;. He also emphasised that he took no pleasure from the act of killing, but &quot;worshipped the art and the act of death&quot;.

==Formal charges==
On 11 February 1983, Nilsen was officially charged with the murder of Stephen Sinclair. He was transferred to HMP Brixton to be held on remand until his trial.

According to Nilsen, upon being transferred to Brixton Prison to await trial, his mood was one of &quot;resignation and relief&quot;, with his belief being that he would be viewed, in accordance with the law, as innocent until proven guilty. He objected to wearing a prison uniform while on remand. In protest at having to wear a prison uniform and what he interpreted to be breaches of prison rules, Nilsen threatened to protest against his remand conditions by refusing to wear any clothes; as a result of this threat, he was not allowed to leave his cell. On 1 August, Nilsen threw the contents of his chamber pot out of his cell, hitting several prison officers. This incident resulted in Nilsen being found guilty on 9 August of assaulting prison officers and subsequently spending fifty-six days in solitary confinement.

On 26 May, Nilsen was committed to stand trial at the Old Bailey on five counts of murder and two of attempted murder (a sixth murder charge was later added). Throughout this committal hearing, he was represented by a solicitor named Ronald Moss, whom he had previously dismissed as his legal representative on 21 April, before Moss was reappointed to the role after Nilsen had complained to magistrates he had been afforded no facilities with which he could mount his own defence. Moss was to remain Nilsen&#x27;s legal representative until July 1983, when Nilsen – again expressing his intention to defend himself – discharged him, until 5 August when Nilsen once again reappointed Moss.

Initially, Nilsen intended to plead guilty to each charge of murder at his upcoming trial. With Nilsen&#x27;s full consent, Moss had fully prepared his defence; five weeks before his trial, Nilsen again dismissed Moss, and opted instead to be represented by Ralph Haeems, upon whose advice Nilsen agreed to plead not guilty by diminished responsibility.

==Trial and sentence==
Nilsen was brought to trial on 24 October 1983, charged with six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. He was tried at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice Croom-Johnson and pleaded not guilty on all charges.

The primary dispute between the prosecuting and defence counsel was not whether Nilsen had killed the victims, but his state of mind before and during the killings. The prosecuting counsel, Allan Green QC, argued that Nilsen was sane, in full control of his actions, and had killed with premeditation. The defence counsel, Ivan Lawrence QC, argued that Nilsen suffered from diminished responsibility, rendering him incapable of forming the intention to commit murder, and should therefore be convicted only of manslaughter.

The prosecution counsel opened the case for the Crown by describing the events of February 1983 leading to the identification of human remains in the drains at Cranley Gardens and Nilsen&#x27;s subsequent arrest, the discovery of three dismembered bodies in his property, his detailed confession, his leading investigators to the charred bone fragments of twelve further victims killed at Melrose Avenue, and the efforts he had taken to conceal his crimes. In a tactful reference to the primary dispute between opposing counsel at the trial, Green closed his opening speech with an answer Nilsen had given to police in response to a question as to whether he needed to kill: &quot;At the precise moment of the act [of murder], I believe I am right in doing the act&quot;. To counteract this argument, Green added: &quot;The Crown says that even if there was mental abnormality, that was not sufficient to diminish substantially his responsibility for these killings&quot;.

The first witness to testify for the prosecution was Douglas Stewart, who testified that in November 1980, he had fallen asleep in a chair in Nilsen&#x27;s flat only to wake to find his ankles bound to a chair and Nilsen strangling him with a tie as he pressed his knee to his (Stewart&#x27;s) chest. Successfully overpowering Nilsen, Stewart testified that Nilsen had then shouted, &quot;Take my money!&quot; This, the prosecution attested, reflected Nilsen&#x27;s rational, cool presence of mind in that he hoped to be overheard by other tenants. Upon leaving Nilsen&#x27;s residence, Stewart had reported the attack to police, who in turn questioned Nilsen. Noting conflicting details in accounts given by both men, police had dismissed the incident as a lovers&#x27; quarrel. Upon cross-examination, the defence counsel sought to undermine Stewart&#x27;s credibility, pointing to minor inconsistencies in the testimony, the fact he had consumed much alcohol on the night in question, and suggesting his memory had been selectively magnified as he had previously sold his story to the press.

On 25 October the court heard testimony from two further men who had survived attempts by Nilsen to strangle them. The first of these, Paul Nobbs, provided testimony which the prosecution asserted was evidence of Nilsen&#x27;s self-control and ability to refrain from homicidal impulses. A university student, Nobbs testified that he accompanied Nilsen to Cranley Gardens for alcohol and sex and woke in the early hours of the morning with &quot;a terrible headache&quot;. Upon washing his face in Nilsen&#x27;s bathroom, as Nobbs noted his eyes were bloodshot and his face completely red, Nilsen had exclaimed, &quot;God! You look bloody awful!&quot; Nilsen then advised the youth to see a doctor. Nobbs had not reported the attack to police for fear of his sexuality being discovered. Contrary to the prosecution&#x27;s claims, the defence counsel asserted that Nobbs&#x27; testimony reflected Nilsen&#x27;s rational self being unable to control his impulses. The fact Nilsen had selected a university student as a potential victim was at odds with the prosecution&#x27;s claim that Nilsen intentionally selected rootless males whose disappearance was unlikely to be noted.

Immediately after the testimony of Nobbs had concluded, Carl Stottor took the stand to recount how, in May 1982, Nilsen had attempted to strangle and drown him, before bringing him &quot;back to life&quot;. Stottor&#x27;s voice frequently quivered with emotion as he recounted how Nilsen had repeatedly attempted to drown him in his bathtub as he pleaded in vain for his life to be spared, and how he later awoke to find Nilsen&#x27;s mongrel dog licking his face; on several occasions, the judge had to allow Stottor time to regain his composure. (The evidence provided by Stottor was not included as part of the indictment against Nilsen as his whereabouts were not known until after the indictment had been completed.)

DCI Jay then recounted the circumstances of Nilsen&#x27;s arrest and his &quot;calm, matter-of-fact&quot; confessions, before reading to the court several statements volunteered by Nilsen following his arrest. In one of these statements, Nilsen had said: &quot;I have no tears for my victims; I have no tears for myself, nor those bereaved by my actions&quot;. Jay admitted it was unusual for anyone accused of such horrific crimes to be so forthcoming in providing information, and conceded upon questioning by defence counsel that Nilsen not only provided most of the evidence against himself but also encouraged the discovery of evidence which could contradict his own version of events. Following Jay&#x27;s testimony, DS Chambers recited Nilsen&#x27;s formal confession to the court. This testimony included graphic descriptions of the ritualistic and sexual acts Nilsen performed with his victims&#x27; bodies, his various methods of storage of bodies and body parts, dismemberment and disposal, and the problems decomposition – particularly regarding colonies of maggots – afforded him. Several jurors were visibly shaken throughout this testimony; others looked at Nilsen with incredulous expressions on their faces as Nilsen listened to the testimony with apparent indifference. This testimony lasted until the following morning when the prosecution included several exhibits into evidence. This included the cooking pot in which Nilsen had boiled the heads of the three victims killed at Cranley Gardens, the cutting board he had used to dissect John Howlett and several rusted catering knives which had formerly belonged to victim Martyn Duffey.

Two psychiatrists testified on behalf of the defence. The first of these, James MacKeith, began his testimony on 26 October. MacKeith testified as to how, through a lack of emotional development, Nilsen experienced difficulty expressing any emotion other than anger, and his tendency to treat other human beings as components of his fantasies. The psychiatrist also described Nilsen&#x27;s association between unconscious bodies and sexual arousal; stating that Nilsen possessed narcissistic traits, an impaired sense of identity, and was able to depersonalise other people. He stated his conclusions that Nilsen displayed many signs of maladaptive behaviour, the combination of which, in one man, was lethal. These factors could be attributed to an unspecified personality disorder from which MacKeith believed Nilsen suffered. In response to the prosecution contention that, in attributing an unspecified disorder to Nilsen, MacKeith was undecided in his conclusions, MacKeith contended that this unspecified personality disorder was severe enough to substantially reduce Nilsen&#x27;s responsibility.

The second psychiatrist to testify for the defence, Patrick Gallwey, diagnosed Nilsen with a &quot;borderline, false-self as if pseudo-normal, narcissistic personality disorder&quot;, with occasional outbreaks of schizoid disturbances that Nilsen managed most of the time to keep at bay; Gallwey stated that, in episodic breakdowns, Nilsen became predominantly schizoid—acting in an impulsive, violent and sudden manner. Gallwey further added that someone suffering from these episodic breakdowns is most likely to disintegrate under circumstances of social isolation. In effect, Nilsen was not guilty of &quot;malice aforethought&quot;. Upon cross-examination, Green largely focused upon the degree of awareness shown by Nilsen and his ability to make decisions. Gallwey conceded that Nilsen was intellectually aware of his actions, but stressed that, due to his personality disorder, Nilsen did not appreciate the criminal nature of what he had done.

On 31 October, the prosecution called Paul Bowden to testify in rebuttal of the psychiatrists who had testified for the defence. Prior to Nilsen&#x27;s trial, Bowden had interviewed the defendant on sixteen separate occasions in interviews totalling over fourteen hours. Over two days, Bowden testified that, although he found Nilsen to be abnormal in a colloquial sense, he had concluded Nilsen to be a manipulative person who had been capable of forming relationships, but had forced himself to objectify people. Refuting the testimony of MacKeith and Gallwey, Bowden further testified he had found no evidence of maladaptive behaviour, and that Nilsen suffered from no disorder of the mind.

Following the closing arguments of both prosecution and defence, the jury retired to consider their verdict on 3 November 1983. The following day, the jury returned with a majority verdict of guilty upon six counts of murder and one of attempted murder, with a unanimous verdict of guilty in relation to the attempted murder of Nobbs. Croom-Johnson sentenced Nilsen to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 25 years&#x27; imprisonment.

==Imprisonment==
Following his conviction, Nilsen was transferred to HMP Wormwood Scrubs to begin his sentence. As a Category A prisoner, he was assigned his own cell and could mix freely with other inmates. Nilsen did not lodge an appeal, accepting that the Crown&#x27;s case – that he had had the capacity to control his actions and that he had killed with premeditation – was essentially correct. He further elaborated on the day of his conviction that he took an enormous thrill from the &quot;social seduction; the getting the &#x27;friend&#x27; back; the decision to kill; the body and its disposal&quot;. Nilsen also claimed drunkenness was the sole reason at least two of his attempted murders were unsuccessful.

In December 1983, Nilsen was cut on the face and chest with a razor blade by an inmate named Albert Moffatt, resulting in injuries requiring eighty-nine stitches. Afterward, he was briefly transferred to HMP Parkhurst, before being transferred to HMP Wakefield, where he remained until 1990. In 1991, Nilsen was transferred to a vulnerable prisoner unit at HMP Full Sutton upon concerns for his safety. He remained there until 1993, when he was transferred to HMP Whitemoor, again as a Category A prisoner, and with increased segregation from other inmates.

The minimum term of 25 years&#x27; imprisonment to which Nilsen was sentenced in 1983 was replaced by a whole-life tariff by Home Secretary Michael Howard in December 1994. This ruling effectively ensured Nilsen would never be released from prison, a punishment he accepted and declined to appeal against.

In 2003, Nilsen was again transferred to HMP Full Sutton, where he remained incarcerated as a Category A prisoner. In the prison workshop, Nilsen translated books into braille. He spent much of his free time reading and writing and was allowed to paint and compose music upon a keyboard. He also exchanged letters with numerous people who sought his correspondence. Nilsen remained at HMP Full Sutton until his death on 12 May 2018.

==Aftermath==

In September 1992, Central Television conducted an interview with Nilsen as part of the programme &quot;Viewpoint 1993 – Murder In Mind&quot;, which focused upon offender profiling. A four-minute section of this interview, in which Nilsen frankly discussed his crimes, was initially scheduled to be broadcast on 19 January 1993; the Home Office sought to ban the interview from being broadcast on the grounds that they had not granted permission for Central to conduct interviews with Nilsen which were later broadcast to the public, and claimed ownership of copyrighted material. Central Television challenged the Home Office ruling in court, citing sections of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, and that full permission to conduct an interview with Nilsen had been granted in advance. On 26 January 1993 Judge William Aldous ruled in Central&#x27;s favour, and the same day, three appeal court judges, Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls; Lord Justice McCowan; and Lord Justice Hirst upheld his decision. The interview was screened in full that evening.

Nilsen repeatedly sought legal avenues to challenge real and perceived abuses of prison rules by prison officers – regularly petitioning the Home Office and, later, the European Court of Human Rights with complaints. As a result, he was an unpopular inmate with successive governors at the various prisons in which he was incarcerated. In October 2001, Nilsen brought a judicial review against the prison service, citing that the gay softcore pornography magazines &quot;Vulcan&quot; and &quot;Him&quot;, to which he subscribed regularly, had some images and articles of a more explicit nature removed before the magazine reached him. The legal case he brought against the prison service was dismissed because he could not establish that any breach of his human rights had occurred.

In the years following his incarceration, Nilsen composed an unpublished, 400-page autobiography, entitled &quot;The History of a Drowning Boy&quot; (the title being a reference to his concepts of the tranquillity of death following his grandfather&#x27;s death and his own near-fatal drowning in 1954). In his autobiography, Nilsen states that, beginning with his service in the army, he constantly lived two separate lives: his &quot;real life&quot; and his &quot;fantasy life&quot;. He writes: &quot;When I was with people, I was in the &#x27;real&#x27; world, and in my private life, I snapped instantly into my fantasy life. I could oscillate between the two with instant ease.&quot; With reference to his murders, Nilsen claimed that his emotional state upon the dates of the murders, in conjunction with the amount of alcohol he had consumed, were both core factors in his decision to kill. He further emphasised that, when feeling low, seizing an opportunity to satisfy the sexual fantasies he had developed in which the victim is the young, attractive and passive partner, and he the older active partner, temporarily relieved him of a general feeling of inadequacy.

Nilsen&#x27;s first murder victim was identified in 2006 as 14-year-old Stephen Holmes. Formal identification was confirmed via a combination of circumstantial evidence and by Nilsen identifying a photograph of the youth shown to him by police (all bone fragments found at Melrose Avenue had been destroyed). He was not charged with this murder as the Crown Prosecution Service decided that a prosecution would not be in the public interest, and would not contribute to his current sentence.

At least four victims killed between 1980 and 1981 at Melrose Avenue remain unidentified. A forensics expert testified at Nilsen&#x27;s 1983 trial that &quot;at least eight bodies&quot; had been incinerated at Melrose Avenue, academically confirming he had murdered at least eleven victims. Several items confiscated from Nilsen&#x27;s Cranley Gardens address – some of which had been introduced as evidence at Nilsen&#x27;s trial – are on display at New Scotland Yard&#x27;s Crime Museum. These exhibits include the stove upon which Nilsen had boiled the heads of his final three victims; the knives he had used to dissect several of his victims&#x27; bodies; the headphones Nilsen had used to strangle Ockenden; the ligature he had fashioned to strangle his last victim; and the bath from his Cranley Gardens address in which he had drowned Howlett and retained the body of Allen prior to dissection.

In January 2021, a former confidant of Nilsen&#x27;s named Mark Austin revealed that an edited version of &quot;The History of a Drowning Boy&quot; was to be posthumously published by RedDoor Press. The autobiography, based upon the 6,000 pages of typewritten notes Nilsen authored while incarcerated, examines his life and crimes and is edited by Austin, who became a pen pal of Nilsen&#x27;s in the years prior to his death and who exchanged more than 800 letters with him. This autobiography was published on 21 January 2021.

==Death==
On 10 May 2018, Nilsen was taken from HMP Full Sutton to York Hospital after complaining of severe stomach pains. He was found to have a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which was repaired, although he subsequently suffered a blood clot as a complication of the surgery. Nilsen died on 12 May. A subsequent post-mortem examination revealed that the immediate cause of Nilsen&#x27;s death was pulmonary embolism and retroperitoneal haemorrhage.

Nilsen&#x27;s body was cremated in June 2018. This service was held with only five mourners present, including three prison officers and the individual with whom Nilsen had corresponded while in prison. No family members were present at the service. In line with Ministry of Justice policy, HMP Full Sutton paid £3,323 towards the cost of Nilsen&#x27;s funeral. His ashes were later handed to his family.

==Victims==
Nilsen is known to have killed twelve young men and boys between 1978 and 1983; it is suspected that the true number of victims may be fifteen. At least nine victims had been killed at 195 Melrose Avenue, with his final three victims being killed at 23 Cranley Gardens. Of Nilsen&#x27;s eight identified victims, only three – Stephen Holmes, Kenneth Ockenden and Graham Allen – had a permanent address at the time of their murder, with the remaining victims largely (though not exclusively) consisting of vagrants, runaways and male prostitutes.

In 1992, Nilsen claimed the true total of victims he killed was twelve, and that he had fabricated the three additional victims he initially confessed to having killed at Melrose Avenue, both in response to pressure as he was being interviewed as well as to simply &quot;stick with the figure&quot; of approximately fifteen victims he had provided investigators with as he was initially escorted to Hornsey police station. Nilsen said that three unidentified victims he had initially confessed to killing – an Irishman in September 1980; a &quot;long-haired hippy&quot; in November or December 1980, and an English skinhead in April 1981 – had been invented to simply &quot;complement the continuity of evidence&quot;. DCI Jay later dismissed Nilsen&#x27;s claims to have killed only twelve victims, stating that in the more than thirty hours of interviews police had conducted with Nilsen when discussing the fifteen victims he had initially confessed to killing, he had never provided any inconsistencies in the physical characteristics, the date or place of encounter, the act of murder, or the ritual he observed with the body of any of the fifteen victims.

===1978===
*30 December: Stephen Dean Holmes, 14. Last seen on his way home from a rock concert; Holmes encountered Nilsen in the Cricklewood Arms on the evening of 29 December before accepting an offer to drink alcohol with him at Melrose Avenue. The following morning, Nilsen strangled Holmes with a necktie until he was unconscious, before drowning him in a bucket of water. His body was to remain beneath Nilsen&#x27;s floorboards for over seven months before being disposed of upon a bonfire, and Holmes was the only victim not to have been dissected before disposal. Investigators announced his identification in November 2006.

===1979===
* 3 December: Kenneth James Ockenden, 23. A Canadian student on a tour of the UK; Ockenden encountered Nilsen in the Princess Louise pub in Holborn on 3 December 1979. He was escorted on a tour of London, before agreeing to accompany Nilsen to his flat for a meal and further drinks. One of the few murder victims who was widely reported as a missing person, Ockenden was strangled with the cord of Nilsen&#x27;s headphones as he listened to a record.

===1980===
* 17 May: Martyn Brandon Duffey, 16. Duffey was a 16-year-old runaway from Birkenhead. On 17 May 1980, Nilsen encountered the youth at a London railway station as he himself returned from a union conference in Southport. Nilsen strangled Duffey and subsequently drowned him in the kitchen sink before bathing with the body. Two days later, Duffey&#x27;s body was placed beneath the floorboards.
* 20 August: William David Sutherland, 26. A 26-year-old father-of-one originally from Edinburgh, who occasionally worked as a male prostitute. Sutherland met Nilsen in a pub near Piccadilly Circus in August 1980. Nilsen could not recall precisely how he had murdered Sutherland, other than that he had strangled Sutherland as he himself stood or knelt in front of this victim and, in the morning, there was &quot;another dead body&quot;.
* September: Unidentified. All that Nilsen could remember about his fifth victim was that he was a tall Irish labourer with rough hands who wore an old suit, jacket and shoes. Nilsen estimated his height to be between and and his age to be between 27 and 30. He had met this victim in the Cricklewood Arms in late 1980. Nilsen later claimed to have fabricated this victim.
* October: Unidentified. Nilsen&#x27;s sixth victim was described by his murderer as a slender male prostitute, approximately in height, who was aged between 20 and 30, and of either Filipino or Mexican descent. To Nilsen, this victim had gypsy-like features. Nilsen met this victim in the Salisbury Arms in October 1980.
* November: Unidentified. This victim was described by Nilsen as being an English vagrant in his 20s, whom he encountered sleeping in a doorway at the top of Charing Cross Road. He was emaciated, with a pale complexion and had several missing teeth. Nilsen and the youth took a taxi to Melrose Avenue; that evening, the victim was strangled to death as he slept, with his legs moving in a cycling motion as he was strangled. Nilsen later stated he believed this victim&#x27;s life had been &quot;one of long suffering&quot;, and that the act of killing this victim had been &quot;as easy as taking candy from a baby&quot;.
* November–December: Unidentified. The last victim to be killed by Nilsen in 1980 was an English &quot;long-haired hippy&quot;, aged between 25 and 30, whom he had met in the West End after the pubs had closed in November or December 1980. This victim&#x27;s body was retained beneath the floorboards of the flat until Nilsen removed the corpse, cut it into three pieces, and then replaced the dissected remains beneath the floorboards. He burned the corpse one year later. Nilsen later claimed to have fabricated this victim.

===1981===
* c. 4 January: Unidentified. The ninth victim was described by Nilsen as an &quot;18-year-old, blue-eyed Scot&quot; with blond hair and who wore a green tracksuit top and trainers. Nilsen met this victim in the Golden Lion pub in Soho in early January 1981. Killed after partaking in a drinking contest with Nilsen at Melrose Avenue, the body of this victim was dissected on 12 January.
* February: Unidentified. Murdered sometime in February 1981. Nilsen recalled little about this victim, other than the fact he was originally from Belfast; was slim, dark-haired, aged in his early 20s, and approximately tall. He had encountered this victim somewhere in the West End after the pubs had closed. He was strangled with a necktie and his body subsequently placed beneath the floorboards.
* April: Unidentified. Nilsen encountered his eleventh victim, a muscular young English skinhead aged approximately 20, at a food stall in Leicester Square in April 1981. He was lured to Nilsen&#x27;s home with the promise of a meal and alcohol. Nilsen recalled this victim wore a black leather jacket and had a tattoo around his neck, simply reading &quot;cut here&quot;, and that he had boasted about how tough he was and how he liked to fight. Nilsen hung this victim&#x27;s naked torso in his bedroom for 24 hours, before placing the body beneath the floorboards. Nilsen later claimed to have fabricated this victim.
* 18 September: Malcolm Stanley Barlow, 23. The final victim to be murdered at Melrose Avenue, Barlow was an epileptic orphan, originally from Sheffield, who had spent much of his life in care homes. He was murdered after returning to Nilsen&#x27;s home to thank him for having ensured he received medical attention the previous day. Prior to dissection, Barlow&#x27;s body was stowed in a kitchen cupboard as Nilsen had no further room beneath his floorboards.

===1982===
* March: John Peter Howlett, 23. Originally from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, Howlett was known to Nilsen as &quot;John the Guardsman&quot;. He was the first victim to be murdered at Cranley Gardens. Howlett was strangled as he slept in Nilsen&#x27;s bed, with Nilsen shouting, &quot;It&#x27;s about time you went&quot; as Howlett awoke to find himself being strangled. Eventually, Nilsen drowned Howlett by holding his head underwater in a bathtub for five minutes. Nilsen subsequently dismembered Howlett&#x27;s body, flushed portions of flesh and internal organs down the toilet and placed various &quot;large bones out with the rubbish&quot;.
* September: Archibald Graham Allen, 27. Allen was a 27-year-old father-of-one, originally from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, whom Nilsen encountered in Shaftesbury Avenue as Allen attempted to hail a taxi in September 1982. Allen was strangled with a ligature as he sat eating an omelette Nilsen had cooked for him. His body was identified from dental records and healed fractures to his jawbone. Dissected portions of flesh and small bones from the body of Allen subsequently blocked the drains at Cranley Gardens.

===1983===
* 26 January: Stephen Neil Sinclair, 20. Nilsen&#x27;s final victim. Sinclair was originally from Perth; at the time he encountered Nilsen, he was a heroin addict who suffered from the habit of self-harming. Nilsen encountered Sinclair in Oxford Street, where he first bought the youth a hamburger before suggesting that Sinclair accompany him to Cranley Gardens. After Sinclair had consumed alcohol and injected heroin at Nilsen&#x27;s flat, Nilsen strangled him to death with a ligature. The head, upper torso and arms of Sinclair were stowed in the tea chest in Nilsen&#x27;s living room; Sinclair&#x27;s lower torso and legs were stowed beneath Nilsen&#x27;s bathtub.

<text>Prambanan (, , Hanacaraka: ꦫꦫꦗꦺꦴꦁꦒꦿꦁ) is a 9th-century Hindu temple compound in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, in southern Java, Indonesia, dedicated to the Trimūrti, the expression of God as the Creator (Brahma), the Preserver (Vishnu) and the Destroyer (Shiva). The temple compound is located approximately northeast of the city of Yogyakarta on the boundary between Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces.

The temple compound, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest Hindu temple site in Indonesia and the second-largest in Southeast Asia after Angkor Wat. It is characterized by its tall and pointed architecture, typical of Hindu architecture, and by the towering central building inside a large complex of individual temples. Prambanan temple compounds originally consisted of 240 temple structures, which represented the grandeur of ancient Java&#x27;s Hindu art and architecture, and is also considered as a masterpiece of the classical period in Indonesia. Prambanan attracts many visitors from around the world.

==History==

===Construction===

The Prambanan temple is the largest Hindu temple of ancient Java, and the first building was completed in the mid-9th century. It was likely started by Rakai Pikatan and inaugurated by his successor King Lokapala. Some historians that adhere to dual dynasty theory suggest that the construction of Prambanan probably was meant as the Hindu Sanjaya dynasty&#x27;s answer to the Buddhist Sailendra dynasty&#x27;s Borobudur and Sewu temples nearby, and was meant to mark the return of the Hindu Sanjaya dynasty to power in Central Java after almost a century of Buddhist Sailendra dynasty domination. Nevertheless, the construction of this massive Hindu temple signified a shift of the Mataram court&#x27;s patronage, from Mahayana Buddhism to Shaivite Hinduism.

A temple was first built at the site around 850 CE by Rakai Pikatan and expanded extensively by King Lokapala and Balitung Maha Sambu the Sanjaya king of the Mataram Kingdom. A short red-paint script bearing the name &quot;pikatan&quot; was found on one of the finials on top of the balustrade of Shiva temple, which confirms that King Pikatan was responsible for the initiation of the temple construction.

The temple complex is linked to the Shivagrha inscription of 856 CE, issued by King Lokapala, which described a Shiva temple compound that resembles Prambanan. According to this inscription the Shiva temple was inaugurated on 12 November 856. According to this inscription, the temple was built to honor Lord Shiva, and its original name was &quot;Shiva-grha&quot; (the House of Shiva) or &quot;Shiva-laya&quot; (the Realm of Shiva).

According to the Shivagrha inscription, a public water project to change the course of a river near Shivagrha temple was undertaken during the construction of the temple. The river, identified as the Opak River, now runs north to south on the western side of the Prambanan temple compound. Historians suggest that originally the river was curved further to east and was deemed too near to the main temple. Experts suggest that the shift of the river was meant to secure the temple complex from the overflowing of lahar volcanic materials from Merapi volcano. The project was done by cutting the river along a north to south axis along the outer wall of the Shivagrha Temple compound. The former river course was filled in and made level to create a wider space for the temple expansion, the space for rows of &quot;pervara&quot; (ancillary) temples.

Some archaeologists propose that the statue of Shiva in the garbhagriha (central chamber) of the main temple was modelled after King Balitung, serving as a depiction of his deified self after death. The temple compound was expanded by successive Mataram kings, such as Daksa and Tulodong, with the addition of hundreds of &quot;pervara&quot; temples around the chief temple.

With main &quot;prasada&quot; tower soaring up to 47 metres high, a vast walled temple complex consists of 240 structures, Shivagrha Trimurti temple was the tallest and the grandest of its time. Indeed, the temple complex is the largest Hindu temple in ancient Java, with no other Javanese temples ever surpassed its scale. Prambanan served as the royal temple of the Kingdom of Mataram, with most of the state&#x27;s religious ceremonies and sacrifices being conducted there. At the height of the kingdom, scholars estimate that hundreds of brahmins with their disciples lived within the outer wall of the temple compound. The urban center and the court of Mataram were located nearby, somewhere in the Prambanan Plain.

===Abandonment===

After being used and expanded for about 80 years, the temples were mysteriously abandoned near the half of the 10th century. In the 930s, the Javanese court was shifted to East Java by Mpu Sindok, who established the Isyana dynasty. It was not clear however, the true reason behind the abandonment of Central Java realm by this Javanese Mataram kingdom. The devastating 1006 eruption of Mount Merapi volcano located around 25 kilometres north of Prambanan in Central Java, or a power struggle may have caused the shift. That event marked the beginning of the decline of the temple, as it was soon abandoned and began to deteriorate.

The temples collapsed during a major earthquake in the 16th century. Although the temple ceased to be an important center of worship, the ruins scattered around the area were still recognizable and known to the local Javanese people in later times. The statues and the ruins became the theme and the inspiration for the Rara Jonggrang folktale.

The Javanese locals in the surrounding villages knew about the temple ruins before formal rediscovery, but they did not know about its historical background: which kingdoms ruled or which king commissioned the construction of the monuments. As a result, the locals developed tales and legends to explain the origin of temples, infused with myths of giants, and a cursed princess. They gave Prambanan and Sewu a wondrous origin; these were said in the Rara Jonggrang legend to have been created by a multitude of demons under the order of Bandung Bondowoso.

===Rediscovery===
In 1733, Cornelis Antonie Lons, a VOC employee, provided a first report on Prambanan temple in his journal. Lons was escorting Julius Frederick Coyett, a VOC commissioner of northeast Java coast, to Kartasura, then the capital of Mataram, a powerful local Javanese kingdom. During his sojourn in Central Java, he had the opportunity to visit the ruins of Prambanan temple, which he described as &quot;Brahmin temples&quot; that resembles a mountain of stones.

After the division of Mataram Sultanate in 1755, the temple ruins and the Opak River were used to demarcate the boundary between Yogyakarta and Surakarta Sultanates, which was adopted as the current border between Yogyakarta and the province of Central Java.

The temple attracted international attention early in the 19th century. In 1803, Nicolaus Engelhard, the Governor of the northeast coast of Java, made a stop in Prambanan during his official visits to two Javanese sultans: Pakubuwana IV of Surakarta and Hamengkubuwana II of Yogyakarta. Impressed by the temple ruins, in 1805 Engelhard commissioned H.C. Cornelius, an engineer stationed in Klaten, to clear the site from earth and vegetation, measuring the area, and made drawings of the temple. This was the first effort to study and restore Prambanan temple.

In 1811 during the short-lived British occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Colin Mackenzie, a surveyor in the service of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, came upon the temples by chance. Although Sir Thomas subsequently commissioned a full survey of the ruins, they remained neglected for decades. Dutch residents carried off sculptures as garden ornaments and native villagers used the foundation stones for construction material. Half-hearted excavations by archaeologists in the 1880s adversely facilitated looting instead, as numbers of temple sculptures were taken away as collections.

===Reconstruction===
In 1918, the Dutch colonial government began the reconstruction of the compound however proper restoration only commenced in 1930. Due to massive scale and the sheer numbers of temples, the efforts at restoration still continue up to this day. By 1930s, the reconstruction project by Dutch East Indies Archaeological Service successfully restored two apit (flank) temples in the central court, and two smaller pervara or in (ancillary) temples. The reconstruction used the anastylosis method, in which a ruined temple is restored using the original stone blocks as much as possible.

The restoration efforts was hampered by the economic crisis in 1930s, and finally ceased altogether due to the outbreak of World War II Pacific War (1942-1945), and the following Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949). After the war, the temple reconstruction resumed in 1949, despite much of technical drawings and photographs were damaged or lost during the war. The reconstruction of the main Shiva temple was completed in 1953 and inaugurated by Indonesia&#x27;s first president Sukarno. 

The Indonesian government continued the reconstruction effort to complete the temple compound. The Brahma temple was reconstructed between 1978 and 1987. While the Vishnu temple was rebuilt from 1982 to 1991. The Vahana temples of the eastern rows and some smaller shrines were completed from 1991 to 1993. Thus by 1993, the whole towering main temples of the Prambanan central zone were erected and completed, simultaneously inaugurated by President Suharto together with the inauguration of the Sewu compound central temple nearby.

Since much of the original stonework has been stolen and reused at remote construction sites, restoration was hampered considerably. Given the scale of the temple complex, the government decided to rebuild shrines only if at least 75% of their original masonry was available, in accordance to anastylosis discipline. The reconstruction continues up to this day, with efforts now focused on the pervara (ancillary) temples of the outer compound. A Pervara temple of eastern side second row number 35 was completed in December 2017.

As per February 2023, from originally 224 pervara temples, only 6 of them are completely reconstructed; 4 on the eastern side, 1 on the southern side, and 1 on the northern side. Two of pervara temples; a corner pervara temple with double porticos on the northeast corner and a pervara temple on the east side, was reconstructed during the Dutch East Indies colonial era circa 1930s. The other 4 pervara temples were completed in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021 respectively. Most of the smaller shrines are now visible only in their foundations. The restoration of pervara temples will be carried out in stages. If all of 224 pervara temples to be restored completely, it will take at least 200 years, since an anastylosis reconstruction of one pervara temple takes approximately 8 to 12 months to complete.

In the early 1990s the government removed the market that had sprung up near the temple and redeveloped the surrounding villages and rice paddies as an archaeological park. The park covers a large area, from Yogyakarta-Solo main road in the south, encompassing the whole Prambanan complex, the ruins of Lumbung and Bubrah temples, and as far as the Sewu temple compound in the north. In 1992 the Indonesian government created a State-owned Limited Liability Enterprise (Persero), named &quot;PT Taman Wisata Candi Borobudur, Prambanan, dan Ratu Boko.&quot; This enterprise is the authority for the park management of Borobudur Prambanan Ratu Boko and the surrounding region. Prambanan is one of the most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia.

The Trimurti open-air and indoor stages on the west side of the temple, across the Opak River, were built to stage the ballet of the traditional &quot;Ramayana&quot; epic. This traditional Javanese dance is the centuries-old dance of the Javanese court. Since the 1960s, it has been performed every full moon night in the Prambanan temple. Since then, Prambanan has become one of the major archaeological and cultural tourism attractions in Indonesia.

===Contemporary events===

Since the reconstruction of the main temples in the 1990s, Prambanan has been reclaimed as an important religious center for Hindu rituals and ceremonies in Java. Balinese and Javanese Hindu communities in Yogyakarta and Central Java revived their practices of annually performing their sacred ceremonies in Prambanan, such as Galungan, Tawur Kesanga, and Nyepi.

The temple was damaged during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake. Early photos suggested that although the complex was structurally intact, the damage was significant. Large pieces of debris, including carvings, were scattered over the ground. The temple was closed to visitors until the damage could be fully assessed. Eventually, the head of Yogyakarta Archaeological Conservation Agency stated that it would take months to identify the full extent of the damage. Some weeks later in 2006, the site was re-opened for visitors.

There is great interest in the site. In 2008, 856,029 Indonesian visitors and 114,951 foreign visitors visited Prambanan. On 6 January 2009 the reconstruction of Nandi temple finished. As of 2009, the interior of most of the temples remains off-limits for safety reasons.

On 14 February 2014, major tourist attractions in Yogyakarta and Central Java, including Borobudur, Prambanan, and Ratu Boko, were closed to visitors after being severely affected by the volcanic ash from the eruption of Kelud volcano in East Java, located about 200 kilometers east of Yogyakarta. The Kelud volcano erupted on 13 February 2014 with explosions heard as far away as Yogyakarta. Four years earlier, Prambanan was spared from the 2010 Merapi volcanic ash and eruption since the wind and ashfall were directed westward and affected Borobudur instead.

In 2012, the &quot;Balai Pelestarian Peninggalan Purbakala Jawa Tengah&quot; (BP3) or Central Java Heritage Preservation Authority suggested that the area in and around Prambanan should be treated as a sanctuary area. The proposed area is located in Prambanan Plain measured 30 square kilometers spanned across Sleman and Klaten Regency, which includes major temples in the area such as Prambanan, Ratu Boko, Kalasan, Sari and Plaosan temples. The sanctuary area is planned to be treated in a similar fashion to the Angkor archaeological area in Cambodia, which means the government should stop or decline permits to construct any new buildings, especially multi-storied buildings, as well as BTS towers in the area. This is meant to protect this archaeologically rich area from modern day visual obstructions and the encroachments of hotels, restaurants, and any tourism-related buildings and businesses.
On 9 to 12 November 2019, the grand &quot;Abhiṣeka&quot; sacred ceremony was performed in this temple compound. This Hindu ritual was held for the first time after 1,163 years after the Prambanan temple was founded on 856. The &quot;Abhiṣeka&quot; ceremony was meant to cleanse, sanctify and purify the temple, thus signify that the temple is not merely an archaeological and tourism site, but also restored to its original function as a focus of Hindu religious activity. Indonesian Hindus believe that this &quot;Abhiṣeka&quot; ceremony marked a turning point to re-consecrated the temple ground and restore the spiritual energy of Prambanan temple.

==The temple compound==
: &quot;This information does not take account of damage caused by the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake&quot;

Originally there were a total of 240 temples standing in Prambanan. The Prambanan Temple Compound consists of:
* 3 Trimurti temples: three main temples dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma
* 3 Vahana temples: three temples in front of Trimurti temples dedicated to the vahana of each gods; Nandi, Garuda and Hamsa
* 2 Apit temples: two temples located between the rows of Trimurti and Vahana temples on north and south side
* 4 Kelir temples: four small shrines located on 4 cardinal directions right beyond the 4 main gates of inner zone
* 4 Patok temples: four small shrines located on 4 corners of inner zone
* 224 Pervara temples: hundreds of temples arranged in 4 concentric square rows; numbers of temples from inner row to outer row are: 44, 52, 60, and 68

The Prambanan compound is also known as Rara Jonggrang complex and is named after the popular legend of Rara Jonggrang. There were once 240 temples standing in this Shivaite temple complex, either big or small. Today, all of eight main temples and eight small shrines in the inner zone are reconstructed, but only six out of the original 224 pervara temples are renovated. The majority of them have deteriorated; what is left are only scattered stones. The Prambanan temple complex consists of three zones; first the outer zone, second the middle zone that contains hundreds of small temples, and third the holiest inner zone that contains eight main temples and eight small shrines.

The Hindu temple complex at Prambanan is based on a square plan that contains a total of three zone yards, each of which is surrounded by four walls pierced by four large gates. The outer zone is a large space marked by a rectangular wall. The outermost walled perimeter, which originally measured about 390 metres per side, was oriented in the northeast–southwest direction. However, except for its southern gate, not much else of this enclosure has survived down to the present. The original function is unknown; possibilities are that it was a sacred park, or priests&#x27; boarding school (ashram). The supporting buildings for the temple complex were made from organic material; as a consequence no remains occur.

===Shiva temple===

The inner zone or central compound is the holiest among the three zones. It is the square elevated platform surrounded by a square stone wall with stone gates on each four cardinal points. This holiest compound is assembled of eight main shrines or &quot;candi&quot;. The three main shrines, called &quot;Trimurti&quot; (&quot;three forms&quot;), are dedicated to the three Gods: Brahma &quot;the Creator&quot;, Vishnu &quot;the Keeper&quot;, and Shiva &quot;the Destroyer&quot;.

The Shiva temple is the tallest and largest structure in Prambanan Rara Jonggrang complex; it measures 47 metres tall and 34 metres wide. The main stairs are located on the eastern side. The eastern gate of Shiva temple is flanked by two small shrines, dedicated to guardian gods, Mahakala and Nandhisvara. The Shiva temple is encircled with galleries adorned with bas-reliefs telling the story of Ramayana carved on the inner walls of the balustrades. To follow the story accurately, visitors must enter from the east side and began to perform &quot;pradakshina&quot; or circumambulating clockwise. The bas-reliefs of Ramayana continue to the Brahma temple galleries.

The Shiva shrine is located at the center and contains five chambers, four small chambers in every cardinal direction and one bigger main chamber in the central part of the temple. The east chamber connects to the central chamber that houses the largest murti in Prambanan, a three-metre high statue of Shiva Mahadeva (the Supreme God). The statue bears &quot;Lakçana&quot; (attributes or symbol) of Shiva such as skull and sickle (crescent) at the crown, and third eye on the forehead; also four hands that holds Shiva&#x27;s symbols: &quot;aksamala&quot; (prayer beads), &quot;chamara&quot; (fly-whisk), and &quot;trisula&quot; (trident). Some historians believe that the depiction of Shiva as Mahadeva was also meant to personify king Balitung as the reincarnation of Shiva. So, when he died, a temple was built to commemorate him as Shiva. The statue of Shiva stands on a lotus pad on a Yoni pedestal that bears the carving of Nāga serpents on the north side of the pedestal.

The other three smaller chambers contain statues of Hindu Gods related to Shiva: his consort Durga, the rishi Agastya, and Ganesha, his son. A statue of Agastya occupies the south chamber, the west chamber houses the statue of Ganesha, while the north chamber contains the statue of &quot;Durga Mahisasuramardini&quot; depicting Durga as the slayer of the Bull demon. The shrine of Durga is also called the temple of &quot;Rara Jonggrang&quot; (Javanese: slender virgin), after a Javanese legend of princess Rara Jonggrang.

===Brahma and Vishnu temples===
The two other main shrines are those of Vishnu on the north side of the Shiva shrine, and the one of Brahma on the south. Both temples face east and each contain only one large chamber, each dedicated to respected gods; Brahma temple contains the statue of Brahma and Vishnu temple houses the statue of Vishnu. Brahma and Vishnu temple measures 20 metres wide and 33 metres tall.

===Vahana temples===

The other three shrines in front of the three main temples are dedicated to the vehicles (vahana) of the respective gods – the bull Nandi for Shiva, the sacred swan Hamsa for Brahma, and Vishnu&#x27;s kite Garuda. Precisely in front of the Shiva temple is the Nandi temple, which contains a statue of the Nandi bull. Next to it, there are also other statues, the statue of Chandra the god of the moon and Surya the god of the sun. Chandra stands on his carriage pulled by 10 horses, the statue of Surya also stands on a carriage pulled by 7 horses. Facing the Brahma temple is the temple of Hamsa or Angsa. The chamber of this temple contains no statue, but it seems likely that there was once a statue of the sacred swan. In front of the Vishnu temple is the temple dedicated to Garuda. However, just like the Hamsa temple, the Garuda temple contains no statue, but probably once contained the statue of Garuda. Garuda holds an important role for Indonesia, as it serves as the national symbol of Indonesia, and also as the name of the airline Garuda Indonesia.

===Apit temples and smaller shrines===

Between these rows of the main temple, on the north and south side, stand two &quot;Candi Apit&quot; temples. &quot;Apit&quot; in Javanese means &quot;flank&quot;. It refers to the position of the two temples that flanked the inner courtyard on the north and south sides. The room inside the Apit temples is now empty. It is not clear to which deities these Apit temples were dedicated. However, examining the southern Apit temple bas-reliefs on the outer wall, a female deity is depicted, most probably Sarasvati, the Shakti (consort) of Brahma. Considering the Hindu pantheon represented in Prambanan temples, it is possible that the southern Apit temple was dedicated to Sarasvati, while the northern Apit temple was dedicated to Lakshmi.

Beside these 8 main temples, there are also 8 smaller shrines; 4 &quot;Candi Kelir&quot; on four cardinal directions of the entrance, and 4 &quot;Candi Patok&quot; on four corners of the inner zone. &quot;Kelir&quot; in Javanese means &quot;screen&quot;, especially referring to &quot;wayang kulit&quot;, fabric screen. It refers to a structure that obstructs the main cardinal entry of gopura. It is similar to &quot;aling-aling&quot; in Balinese architecture. &quot;Patok&quot; in Javanese means &quot;peg&quot;. It refers to the shrine location at the four corners of the inner compound.

===Pervara temples===

The two walled perimeters that surround the remaining two yards to the interior are oriented to the four cardinal points. The second yard&#x27;s walled perimeter, which measures about 225 metres per side, surrounds a terraced area that consists of four rows containing 44, 52, 60, and 68 pervara temples, for 224 structures in total. Respectively, each has a height of 14 metres and measures 6×6 metres at the base. The sixteen temples located at the corners of the rows face two directions; the remaining 208 structures open to only one of the four cardinal directions.

The middle zone consists of four rows of 224 individual small shrines. There are great numbers of these temples, but most of them are still in ruins and only some have been reconstructed. These concentric rows of temples were made in an identical design, with flight of stairs and porticos facing outward, with exception of the corner pervara temples that has two porticos. Each row towards the center is slightly elevated.

These shrines are called &quot;Candi Perwara&quot; in Indonesian or pervara temples, which means ancillary, guardian or complementary temples, the additional buildings of the main temple. Some believed it was offered by regional rulers and nobles to the king as a sign of submission. The pervara are arranged in four rows around the central temples. Some believed it had something to do with four castes, made according to the rank of the people allowed to enter them; the row nearest to the central compound was accessible to the priests only, the other three were reserved for the nobles, the knights, and the simple people respectively. While another believed that the four rows of pervara had nothing to do with four castes, it was just simply made as a meditation place for priests and as a worship place for devotees.

===Gates and walls===

Most of the original perimeter walls and &quot;gapura&quot; gates surrounding the outer compound are missing, leaving only the trace of wall&#x27;s foundations. The walls and gates demarcating the middle compound that contains rows of pervara temples are mostly gone too, with exception of the southern gate that has been successfully reconstructed.

The paduraksa gates into inner compound are mostly has been completely reconstructed; i.e. south, west, and north paduraksa gates, with the exception only eastern gate that has not been rebuilt yet.

==Architecture==

The architecture of the Prambanan temple follows the typical Hindu architecture traditions based on Vastu Shastra. The temple design incorporated mandala temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples. Prambanan was originally named &quot;Shivagrha&quot; and dedicated to the god Shiva. The temple was designed to mimic Meru, the holy mountain, the abode of Hindu gods, and the home of Shiva. The whole temple complex is a model of the Hindu universe according to Hindu cosmology and the layers of Loka.

Just like Borobudur, Prambanan also recognizes the hierarchy of the temple zones, spanned from the less holy to the holiest realms. Each Hindu and Buddhist concept has its terms, but the concepts are essentially identical. Either the compound site plan (horizontally) or the temple structure (vertically) consists of three zones:
* Bhurloka (in Buddhism: &quot;Kāmadhātu&quot;), the lowest realm of common mortals; humans, animals also demons. Where humans are still bound by their lust, desire and unholy way of life. The outer courtyard and the foot (base) part of each temple has symbolized the realm of &quot;bhurloka&quot;.
* Bhuvarloka (in Buddhism: &quot;Rupadhatu&quot;), the middle realm of holy people, occupied by rishis, ascetics, and lesser gods. People here begin to see the light of truth. The middle courtyard and the body of each temple symbolize the realm of &quot;bhuvarloka&quot;.
* Svarloka (in Buddhism: &quot;Arupadhatu&quot;), the highest and holiest realm, reserved for the gods. Also known as &quot;svargaloka&quot;. The inner courtyard and the roof of each temple symbolize the realm of &quot;svarloka&quot;. The roof of Prambanan temples are adorned and crowned with &quot;ratna&quot; (sanskrit: jewel), the shape of Prambanan &quot;Ratna&quot; took the altered form of vajra that represent diamonds. In ancient Java temple architecture, &quot;Ratna&quot; is the Hindu counterpart of the Buddhist &quot;stupa&quot;, and served as the temple&#x27;s pinnacle. It also has more than 140 inner temples, along with 30 main ones.

During the restoration, a well which contains a &quot;pripih&quot; (stone casket) was discovered under the centre of the Shiva temple. The main temple has a well 5.75 m deep in which a stone casket was found on top a pile of charcoal, earth, and remains of burned animal bones. Sheets of gold leaves with the inscription Varuna (god of the sea) and Parvata (god of the mountains) were found here. The stone casket contained sheets of copper, charcoal, ashes, earth, 20 coins, jewels, glass, pieces of gold and silver leaves, seashells and 12 gold leaves (which were cut in the shapes of a turtle, Nāga serpent, padma, altar, and an egg).

==Reliefs==
===Ramayana and Bhagavata Purana===
The temple is adorned with panels of narrative bas-reliefs telling the story of the Hindu epic Ramayana and Bhagavata Purana. The narrative bas-relief panels were carved along the inner balustrades wall on the gallery around the three main temples.

The narrative panels on the balustrade read from left to right. The story starts from the east entrance where visitors turn left and move around the temple gallery in a clockwise direction. This conforms with &quot;pradaksina&quot;, the ritual of circumambulation performed by pilgrims who move in a clockwise direction while keeping the sanctuary to their right. The story of Ramayana starts on Shiva temple balustrade and continues to Brahma temple. On the balustrades in Vishnu temple there is series of bas-relief panels depicting the stories of lord Krishna from Bhagavata Purana.

The bas-relief of Ramayana illustrate how Sita, the wife of Rama, is abducted by Ravana. The monkey king Hanuman brings his army to help Rama and rescue Sita. This story is also shown by the Ramayana Ballet, regularly performed at full moon at Trimurti open-air theatre on the west side of the illuminated Prambanan complex.

===Lokapalas, Brahmins and Devatas===
On the other side of the narrative panels, the temple wall along the gallery was adorned with statues and reliefs of devatas and brahmin sages. The figures of lokapalas, the celestial guardians of directions, can be found in Shiva temple. The brahmin sage editors of veda were carved on Brahma temple wall, while in Vishnu temple the figures of male deities devatas are flanked by two apsaras.
===Prambanan panel: Lion and Kalpataru===
The lower outer wall of these temples was adorned with a row of small niches containing an image of &quot;sinha&quot; (a lion) flanked by two panels depicting bountiful kalpataru (kalpavriksha) trees. These wish-fulfilling sacred trees, according to Hindu-Buddhist belief, are flanked on either side by kinnaras or animals, such as pairs of birds, deer, sheep, monkeys, horses, elephants etc. The pattern of lion in niche flanked by kalpataru trees is typical in the Prambanan temple compound, thus it is called a &quot;Prambanan panel&quot;.

==The Rara Jonggrang legend==

The popular legend of Rara Jonggrang is what connects the site of the Ratu Boko Palace, the origin of the Durga statue in the northern cell/chamber of the main shrine, and the origin of the Sewu temple complex nearby.
The legend tells the story about Prince Bandung Bondowoso, who fell in love with Princess Rara Jonggrang, the daughter of King Boko. But the princess rejected his proposal of marriage because Bandung Bondowoso had killed King Boko and ruled her kingdom.
Bandung Bondowoso insisted on the union, and finally Rara Jonggrang was forced to agree to a union in marriage, but she posed one impossible condition: Bandung must build her a thousand temples in only one night.

The Prince entered into meditation and conjured up a multitude of supernatural beings from the earth. Helped by these spirits, he succeeded in building 999 temples. When the prince was about to complete the condition, the princess woke her palace maids and ordered the women of the village to begin pounding rice and set a fire in the east of the temple, attempting to make the prince and the spirits believe that the sun was about to rise. As the cocks began to crow, fooled by the light and the sounds of daybreak, the supernatural helpers fled back into the ground. The prince was furious about the trick and in revenge he cursed Rara Jonggrang, turning her to stone. She became the last and the most beautiful of the thousand statues. According to the traditions, the unfinished thousandth temple created by the demons become the Sewu temple compounds nearby (&quot;Sewu&quot; means &quot;thousands&quot; in Javanese), and the Princess is the image of Durga in the north cell of the Shiva temple at Prambanan, which is still known as &quot;Rara Jonggrang&quot; or &quot;Slender Maiden&quot;.

== Access ==
The Prambanan temple compound, as well as the entire archaeological complex, is easily accessible because its proximity with Yogyakarta–Solo highway, a highway running from Yogyakarta in the west to Surakarta, Central Java in the east. The highway, located south of the complex, is a part of Indonesian National Route 15, which running from Yogyakarta further into Surabaya in East Java.

The temple compound is also close to Prambanan bus terminal, in which the K3S line of Trans Jogja stops there as a terminal point. About 750 meters southeast from the compound is Brambanan Station in Klaten Regency, which serves KAI Commuter&#x27;s Yogyakarta Line.

==Other temples around Prambanan==

The Prambanan Plain spans between the southern slopes of Merapi volcano in the north and the Sewu mountain range in the south, near the present border Yogyakarta province and Klaten Regency, Central Java. Apart from the Lara Jonggrang complex, the Prambanan plain, valley and hills around it is the location of some of the earliest Buddhist temples in Indonesia. Not far to the north are found the ruins of Bubrah temple, Lumbung temple, and Sewu temple. Further east is found Plaosan temple. To the west are found Kalasan temple and Sari temple, and further to the west is Sambisari temple. While to the south the Ratu Boko compound is on higher ground.

<text>The Channel Dash (, Operation Cerberus) was a German naval operation during the Second World War. A (German Navy) squadron comprising two s, and , the heavy cruiser and their escorts was evacuated from Brest in Brittany to German ports. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had arrived in Brest on 22 March 1941 after the success of Operation Berlin in the Atlantic. More raids were planned and the ships were refitted at Brest. The ships were a threat to Allied trans-Atlantic convoys and RAF Bomber Command attacked them from 30 March 1941. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was hit on 6 April 1941 and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; on 24 July 1941, after dispersal to La Pallice. In late 1941, Adolf Hitler ordered the (OKM; German Navy High Command) to plan an operation to return the ships to German bases in case of a British invasion of Norway. The short route up the English Channel was preferred to a detour around the British Isles for surprise and air cover by the and on 12 January 1942, Hitler gave orders for the operation.

The British exploited decrypts of German radio messages coded with the Enigma machine, air reconnaissance by the RAF Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU) and agents in France to watch the ships and report the damage caused by the bombing. Operation Fuller, a joint Royal Navy–RAF contingency plan, was devised to counter a sortie by the German ships against Atlantic convoys, a return to German ports by circumnavigating the British Isles, or a dash up the English Channel. The Royal Navy had to keep ships at Scapa Flow in Scotland in case of a sortie by the from Norway. The RAF had sent squadrons from Bomber and Coastal commands overseas and kept torpedo bombers in Scotland ready for &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, which limited the number of aircraft available against a dash up the Channel, as did the winter weather which reduced visibility and blocked airfields with snow.

On 11 February 1942, the ships left Brest at (German time) and escaped detection for more than twelve hours, approaching the Strait of Dover without discovery. The provided air cover in (Operation Thunderbolt) and as the ships neared Dover, the British belatedly responded. Attacks by the RAF, Fleet Air Arm, Navy and bombardments by coastal artillery were costly failures but &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; were damaged by mines in the North Sea (&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was out of action for a year). By 13 February, the ships had reached German ports; Winston Churchill ordered an inquiry into the debacle and &quot;The Times&quot; denounced the British fiasco. The judged the operation a tactical success and a strategic failure because the threat to Atlantic convoys had been sacrificed for a hypothetical threat to Norway. On 23 February, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was torpedoed off Norway and after being repaired, spent the rest of the war in the Baltic. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; went into dry dock and was bombed on the night of never to sail again; &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was sunk at the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943.

==Background==

===Port of Brest, 1940–1941===
German commerce raiding against British north Atlantic convoys was made easier by the capture of Norway and France in 1940. An abortive sortie by the cruiser ended at Brest, at the west end of the Brittany peninsula, on 27 December 1940. After five weeks of attacks by Bomber Command to no effect, the ship put to sea on 1 February 1941, sank numerous ships and returned on 14 February, before sailing to Germany using the roundabout route via the Denmark Strait the next day, reaching Kiel on 28 March. The commerce raids in the north Atlantic during the winter of 1940–1941 by &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;-class battleships and , the heavy cruisers and &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; sank British shipping at a higher rate than German surface ships achieved for the rest of the war. The British reformed 19 Group for Coastal Command in January 1941, which kept watch on the German ships at Brest; &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; arrived at the port on 22 March 1941.

===British air offensive, 1941===

From 10 January to mid-April 1941, Bomber Command aimed of bombs at the ships in Brest harbour. Winston Churchill issued the Battle of the Atlantic directive on 9 March, directing the priority of the British war effort temporarily to counter the German campaign against Atlantic convoys. The RAF photographic reconnaissance unit (1 PRU) discovered &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; in port on 28 March. Bomber Command flew about against the ships in Brest, through poor weather over the next two months. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; needed an engine room overhaul and entered dry dock on 4 April and an unexploded bomb was found between the stocks under the ship. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had to be refloated and removed to defuse the bomb. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was moored in an exposed position in the roadstead, where it was photographed by a 1 PRU Spitfire on 5 April. A raid was quickly planned with the six Beaufort torpedo bombers at RAF St Eval for an attack at dawn the next day.

Three Beauforts carried bombs to damage the torpedo nets that were presumed to protect the ship and three carried torpedoes. Two of the bombers bogged when taxiing for take-off and the third never found Brest in the thick weather. Two of the torpedo-bombers arrived off Brest, where they were to wait until the nets had been bombed. As dawn arrived the Beaufort flown by Kenneth Campbell attacked and dropped the torpedo as they passed over the mole giving it the maximum distance to arm on its run to its target. There were no torpedo nets and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was hit on the starboard side in the region of the after turret; the Beaufort was shot down, killing all on board. The damage to &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was severe, affecting the starboard propeller shaft bearings and shaft tunnel, causing flooding where the explosion destroyed the watertight integrity of stuffing boxes. Fuel and sea-water got into some important compartments and some equipment suffered shock damage. A salvage tug was needed to assist in getting the flooding under control.
&quot;Gneisenau&quot; went back into dry dock and on the night of it was hit by four bombs and suffered two near misses. One of the hits did not explode but the others killed 75 crewmen, jammed &#x27;B&#x27; turret and distorted the armoured deck near it, made about a third of the crew quarters uninhabitable by fire and blast damage, destroyed the kitchens and bakery and affected some gunnery control systems. The damage to &quot;Gneisenau&quot; led the &quot;Seekriegsleitung&quot; (SKL) to raise the question of the suitability of Brest for heavy surface units; Raeder disagreed and wanted more air defences instead. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was not damaged but the bomb hits on the docks delayed its refit, which included a substantial overhaul of its machinery; the boiler superheater tubes had a manufacturing defect that had plagued the ship throughout Operation Berlin. Repairs had been expected to take ten weeks but delays, exacerbated by British mine laying in the vicinity, caused them to miss (Operation Rhine Exercise). The sortie by and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; into the North Atlantic went ahead and &quot;Bismarck&quot; was sunk; &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; returned to Brest on 1 June. Hitler ordered that capital ships must operate with much greater caution, that severely limited the freedom of action of the German surface fleet.

During the summer the new RAF heavy bombers attacked &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was hit on the night of and put out of action. The sailing on 21 July of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; to La Pallice forestalled a surprise attack by Bomber Command. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was attacked by six Stirling bombers on the evening of 23 July and German fighters shot down one bomber. The attack on Brest took place in daylight on 24 July, with a loss of La Pallice was bombed again by fifteen Halifaxes. The formation was met by and anti-aircraft fire () five bombers being shot down, five seriously damaged and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; hit five times. While returning to Brest containing of seawater, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was attacked by a Beaufort but shot it down before it could drop its torpedo. By late July 1941, the bombing left the three large ships in Brest undergoing extensive repairs. &quot;Lützow&quot; had been seriously damaged by a torpedo on 13 June; &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; were undergoing maintenance in German shipyards, was still working up and &quot;Bismarck&quot; had been sunk. British code breakers had contributed to the destruction of the German supply-ship network in the Atlantic that supported surface ship actions against Allied convoys.

From 28 March to the end of July, of bombs were dropped in Bomber Command, which also sent sorties, with another Coastal Command, laying off Brest; the British lost three being mine layers. For the next two months, Bomber Command made frequent small attacks, then attacked on the night of followed by on the night of Frequent small attacks were resumed and about were flown from July to December. At the start of the month, the Brest Group was made the Bomber Command priority again and from 11 December, bombing and mine laying took place nightly. When &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was found out of dry dock on 16 December, a attack was made on the night of followed by a day operation by bombers on the afternoon of 18 December, escorted by ten fighter squadrons. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was slightly damaged and dock gates were smashed, stranding &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; for a month, for the loss of six bombers. Attacks continued all month and another day raid by Halifaxes was made on 30 December. From 1 August to 31 December, of high explosive and of incendiaries were dropped, eleven heavy bombers were shot down and considerable damage was inflicted on the docks and the town but none of the ships were hit again. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was damaged on the evening of 6 January; 37 per cent of Bomber Command sorties between 10 December and 20 January 1942 were flown against the ships at Brest.

===Ultra===

Ultra was the code name used by British military intelligence for signals intelligence obtained by breaking German radio and teleprinter communications, including signals encrypted by Enigma, a German electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine. The decryption was carried out at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park and the information was passed on to operational commands. From May 1941, Bletchley could read the Enigma &quot;Home Waters&quot; setting used by surface ships with few failures or interruptions, which combined with the PRU and reports from agents kept watch on the ships at Brest. By April 1941, the British knew that the three ships had been hit but not the extent of the damage. 

From 16 to 23 December, Enigma decrypts showed that the gunners of the ships were on the Baltic, conducting gunnery training. Next day, the Admiralty warned that an attempt to break out was likely. On 25 January 1942, the ships were photographed in the harbour and two short periods in dry dock by two ships were seen. From the end of January to early February, torpedo boats, minesweepers and destroyers joined the big ships; together with news that the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in Norway had moved to the south, this led the Admiralty to issue an appreciation on 2 February that the three ships were going to attempt to sail up the channel and sent the signal &quot;Executive Fuller&quot;, the order to begin the operation to prevent the German Fleet from breaking into the North Atlantic. Next day Enigma and RAF photographic reconnaissance (PR) found that the number of German ship reinforcements from Brest to the Hook of Holland had risen to seven destroyers, ten torpedo-boats, more than and many smaller craft.

===Norway Hypothesis===
During 1941, Hitler decided that the Brest Group should return to home waters in a &quot;surprise break through the Channel&quot;, as part of a plan to thwart a British invasion of Norway. OKM preferred the Denmark Strait passage to Germany and (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder called a journey along the English Channel impossible. Hitler said that the break-out should be planned with no training period, since British intelligence was bound to find out and have the ships bombed. Hitler ordered that a period of bad weather should be chosen, when the bulk of the RAF would be grounded. (vice admiral) Kurt Fricke (Chief of Staff of the SKL) opposed Hitler but was allowed only a short time to review the policy. On 12 January 1942, Raeder again opposed the channel route but planned for it, provided that Hitler took the final decision.

Hitler noted that the ships at Brest had diverted British bombing from Germany but that the advantage would end as soon as the ships were sufficiently damaged. Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax outlined a plan for a standing start at night to gain surprise and to pass the Strait of Dover, wide and the narrowest part of the Channel, during the day, to benefit from fighter cover at the danger point. The refused to guarantee that the available could protect the ships but Hitler accepted the plan. Hitler ordered that the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, already in Norway, was to be moved south to Trondheim. At a conference on 22 January, Hitler announced that all ships and U-boats should assemble for the defence of Norway and on 25 January, Karl Dönitz ( BdU, Commander of Submarines) was ordered to withdraw eight submarines to patrol off Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Scotland. Despite protests from Dönitz, another twelve U-boats were reserved for Norway, along with the surface ships being concentrated in Norwegian waters.

==Prelude==

===Operation Cerberus===
Hitler preferred the Channel route and responsibility was delegated to (Naval Command West, Admiral Alfred Saalwächter) for planning and operational directions; Ciliax was commander of the Brest Group (flagship, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;). Care was taken to choose the best route to avoid British minefields and to steam at high speed. Minesweepers cleared channels through the British mines and marked with buoys (from 3 to 9 February, Bomber Command laid 98 mines in the channels). U-boats were sent for meteorological observations and several destroyers steamed westward down the Channel to Brest to strengthen the escort screen. To have the longest period of darkness possible, the departure was to be four days before the new moon and at to benefit from a spring tide flowing up the Channel, which would add speed and possibly lift the ships over mines.

Air cover was to be provided by the and six destroyers would escort the Brest Group on the first leg, to be joined by ten E-boats at dawn; a mixture of E-boats, R-boats and small craft would join at Cap Gris Nez. During January, the and rehearsed for the operation but the ships had lost seaworthiness and many technicians and experts had been transferred from Brest to more pressing duties. By 9 February, the ships had completed their trials in Brest roads and the sortie was set for 11 February. Morale of the crews was high, no sabotage had occurred at Brest and the crews went ashore freely. Among locals there was no doubt that the ships were preparing to depart and as a deception, tropical helmets were brought on board, French dock workers loaded oil barrels marked &quot;For Use in the Tropics&quot; and false rumours were spread around town.

Hans Jeschonnek, chief of staff, refused to guarantee the success of Cerberus or to reinforce the fighter forces in the west. Adolf Galland was given command of the air operation, to be called (Operation Thunderbolt). Details of the plan were arranged with (Colonel) Karl Koller, chief of staff of (Air Fleet 3 Hugo Sperrle). Some training units were mobilised to make up for the bulk of the being absent in the Soviet Union. The (signals intelligence service, General Wolfgang Martini) attempted to jam British radio-telephone frequencies by using a technique to increase atmospheric interference and reduced the performance of British coastal radars by slowly increasing their jamming. Dornier Do 217s of (Bomber Wing 2) were to fly electronic deception sorties over the western Channel to divert British aircraft. ( [Air Force General] Joachim Coeler) prepared to bomb RAF bases in south-western England and to attack British naval forces attempting to intercept the Brest Group. &quot;Fernaufklärungsgruppe&quot; 123 (Long-range Reconnaissance Wing 123) was to keep watch on both ends of the Channel and support .

The convoy route was divided into three sectors using the (Fighter Sector) boundaries but to ensure local control Max Ibel, the former commander of (Fighter Group 27) was appointed (, Fighter Controller: Ship) and embarked on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; as a signals officer to communicate with units during the operation. Eight rehearsals, involving around were made from 22 January to 10 February. The (day fighter wings) and the night fighters of (Night Fighter Wing 1), were swiftly to prepare aircraft for the next sortie by rearming and refuelling in no more than thirty minutes. Galland decided that the aircraft should fly high and low cover, the low groups flying under British coastal radar. A standing patrol of least was to be maintained, in two formations of eight aircraft for their patrol altitudes, with each formation in two of four aircraft. One was to fly out to sea and one towards land in a zigzag and all were to fly back and forth along the line of ships in wide figures of eight, in radio silence. Every sortie was timed to allow the fighters over the ships, just enough time for relieved units to refuel, rearm and return. During , the relieving sortie arrived after only 20 minutes which meant that fighter cover for half the dash would be 

===Operation Fuller===
In April 1941, the Royal Navy and the RAF devised Operation Fuller, a plan for combined operations against the ships in Brest should they sortie. Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay of the Dover Command was to be responsible for operations to confront a German squadron sailing up the Channel, with continuous co-ordinated attacks by Coastal Command, the Navy and RAF. British coastal radar had a range of about and with the five standing air patrols, the planners expected a dash up the Channel easily to be discovered, even at night or in bad weather. As soon as the alarm was raised, the offensive provisions of Fuller would begin. The of the Dover and Ramsgate flotillas, with a Motor Gun Boat (MGB) escort, would make torpedo attacks from . The boats would be followed up by Fairey Swordfish torpedo-bombers with fighter escorts and by Beaufort torpedo-bombers; the coastal guns at Dover would fire for as long as the ships were in range; Bomber Command would attack any ship damaged enough to have been slowed or brought to a stop.

As the German ships moved beyond the Straits of Dover, six Harwich-based destroyers of the Nore Command would make torpedo attacks and the RAF would continue bombing and also lay mines in the paths of the ships. Bomber Command intended to have at four hours&#x27; notice (about of its operational strength), by reserving around from each group. Of the other half would continue operations against Germany and the rest would be preparing for operations next day. The aircraft reserved for Fuller were rotated and weather permitting, bomb Brest. Fighter Command would escort the torpedo-bombers with fighters from 10 Group in the south-west and the squadrons of 11 Group in the south-east. Each service arm had exchanged liaison officers at headquarters and operations rooms but did not use a common communications system.

====Readiness====

The preliminaries of the German manoeuvre, especially minesweeping in the Channel and the transit of destroyers to Brest, led the Admiralty to issue a forecast that a sortie into the Atlantic was improbable and that a move to sheltered waters by a dash up the Channel rather than via the Denmark Strait or into the Mediterranean to Italian ports was to be expected. Next day the Nore Command was ordered to keep six destroyers on call in the Thames and be ready to send six torpedo boats to reinforce those at Dover. The fast s and were detached to Plymouth Command to mine the Brest approaches and to Dover to mine the eastern exit of the Channel respectively. Most submarines were in the Mediterranean but two training boats were sent into the Bay of Biscay. On 6 February, the only modern submarine in home waters, was allowed to sail into Brest Roads, the commander using information supplied through Ultra on minefields, swept channels and training areas. The six operational Swordfish torpedo-bombers of 825 Squadron FAA (Lieutenant-Commander Eugene Esmonde) were moved from RNAS Lee-on-Solent to RAF Manston in Kent, closer to Dover.

The RAF alerted its forces involved in Operation Fuller to indefinite readiness and on 3 February, 19 Group, Coastal Command began night reconnaissance patrols by Air to Surface Vessel Mk II radar (ASV) equipped Lockheed Hudsons, supposedly able to detect ships at range. Patrol line &quot;Stopper&quot; was already being flown off Brest and &quot;Line South East&quot; from Ushant to the Isle de Bréhat and &quot;Habo&quot; from Le Havre to Boulogne began. Coastal Command had three Beaufort torpedo-bomber squadrons in Britain, 42 Squadron at RAF Leuchars in Scotland, of 86 Squadron and 217 Squadron in Cornwall and seven 217 Squadron aircraft at Thorney Island (Portsmouth). Two days later, Enigma showed that Ciliax had joined &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and with the recent exercises, led the Admiralty to predict an impending departure. On 8 February, in a break in the weather, PR found that the ships were still in harbour, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was in dock and that another two destroyers had arrived.

Air Chief Marshal Philip Joubert de la Ferté, Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Coastal Command, sent an appreciation to Fighter and Bomber commands, that a sortie could be expected any time after 10 February. The Coastal Command groups were alerted and 42 Squadron was ordered to fly its south to Norfolk (the move was delayed until next day by snow on the airfields in East Anglia). Air Vice Marshal J. E. A. Baldwin, AOC Bomber Command, stood down half of its bombers and reduced the other from four to two hours&#x27; notice, without informing the Admiralty. On 11 February, &quot;Sealion&quot; moved towards Brest on the afternoon tide, found nothing and returned at to re-charge batteries, ready for another try the next day. The German ships had been scheduled to depart Brest at but were delayed by a Bomber Command raid, which had been ordered after photo-reconnaissance had found the ships still in harbour with torpedo nets deployed at For the previous week, Enigma had been providing information that the Germans were minesweeping on a route that made a dash up the Channel a certainty and with reference to captured charts gave away the German route, which was passed on by the Admiralty at on 12 February. (The daily naval Enigma Home Waters settings for took Bletchley Park until 15 February to break.)

==Battle==

===Night, 11/12 February===

The ships at Brest were scheduled to depart at on 11 February but an air raid by 18 Wellington bombers delayed the departure. The all clear sounded at and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, accompanied by six destroyers sailed thirty minutes later. A British agent in Brest was unable to signal that the Brest Group was departing because of German wireless jamming; &quot;Sealion&quot;, patrolling outside the harbour, had withdrawn to recharge its batteries.

Patrol &quot;Stopper&quot;, near Brest, was being flown by an ASV Hudson from 224 Squadron when the Brest Group began assembling outside the port. At the patrol height of the ASV had a range of about but the Hudson was flying south-west as the ships turned towards Ushant and received no contact. The last eight minutes of the next &quot;Stopper&quot; sortie came within about of the ships but received no contact on the radar.

&quot;Line South East&quot; ran past Ushant to the vicinity of Jersey, to find a sortie from Brest which had turned up the Channel. The Brest Group crossed &quot;Line South East&quot; at on 12 February, but the Hudson patrol was not there, having been ordered to return when its ASV failed. Joubert was short of aircraft and sent no replacement, also because &quot;Stopper&quot; had reported nothing untoward and if the Brest Group had sailed before &quot;Stopper&quot; began, it would already have passed &quot;Line South East&quot;. &quot;Habo&quot;, the third patrol line, from Cherbourg to Boulogne was conducted as usual, until a dawn fog was forecast over British airfields and the aircraft was called back at when the Brest Group was still west of the line.

===12 February===

====Morning====
The only patrol over the Channel was the routine dawn patrol by Fighter Command from Ostend, south to the mouth of the Somme, which the Brest Group passed at From RAF radar operators under Squadron Leader Bill Igoe, using an un-jammed radar frequency, noticed four plots of German aircraft circling in places north of Le Havre, which at first were thought to be air-sea rescue operations. At 11 Group RAF Fighter Command realised that the plots were moving north-east at and sent two Spitfires to reconnoitre at about the time that news reached Fighter Command headquarters that radar-jamming had begun at and that the station at Beachy Head was detecting surface ships. Radar stations in Kent reported two large ships off Le Touquet at and when the Spitfire patrol landed at having kept radio silence, the pilots reported a flotilla off Le Touquet (near Boulogne) but not the capital ships.

News of the sighting was rushed to 11 Group and the Navy at Dover by (One pilot then mentioned a big ship and a certain sighting was received as he was being debriefed.) By coincidence, two senior fighter pilots from RAF Kenley had decided to fly an intruder mission to the French coast at while the other pilots were grounded due to the bad weather. The pair spotted two Messerschmitt Bf 109s (Bf 109) and attacked, then found themselves over a German flotilla of two big ships, a destroyer screen and an outer ring of E-boats. The Spitfires were dived on by about fighters and escaped through anti-aircraft fire from the ships, strafed an E-boat and made off at wave-top height. After they landed at the pilots reported that the German ships had been off Le Touquet at by the alarm had been raised that the Brest Group was entering the Straits of Dover with air cover.

At Bomber Command had been alerted that the Brest Group was near Dover and warned the groups to be ready. Including aircraft that had flown the night before and those at four hours&#x27; notice, Air Marshal Richard Peirse had about but the on two hours&#x27; notice had been loaded with semi-armour-piercing bombs which were effective only if dropped from or higher. Visibility was poor with rain and to cover, down to and unless there were breaks in the cloud just when needed the task was impossible. Peirse ordered general-purpose bombs to be loaded, which could only cause superficial blast damage and attacks at low altitude, in the hope that the attacks would distract the Brest Group as Coastal Command and the Navy made torpedo attacks.

====Noon====


At Dover in 1940, there were four guns with a range of , two guns with a range of , two modern 6-inch batteries with range and four more 9.2-inch guns on new mountings with a range of and then with supercharging. (After the fall of France, Axis ships could avoid the Dover mine barrage by sailing close to the French coast.) A supercharged naval gun could fire shells but was difficult to use against moving targets. The South Foreland Battery of the Dover guns, with their new K-type radar set, tracked the ships of the Brest Group coming up the Channel towards Cap Gris Nez.

At the Dover guns fired their first salvo but with visibility down to , there could be no observation of the fall-of-shot. The gunners hoped that the radar would detect the shell splashes and allow corrections to be made, although this method had never been tried before. &quot;Blips&quot; on the K-set clearly showed the ships zig-zagging but not where the shells were landing. Full battery salvo firing began and the four 9.2-inch guns fired at the German ships, which were moving out of range at and all missed. German sources state that the fleet had already passed Dover when the coastal artillery opened fire and that the shells landed well astern of the major German units. The coastal guns ceased fire when light naval forces and torpedo-bombers began to attack and by the German ships passed beyond the effective range of the British radar.

====Afternoon====
The six Swordfish torpedo-bombers of 825 Squadron FAA, took off from Manston at after Esmonde decided that he could wait no longer, meeting the Spitfire escorts of 72 Squadron at all setting off for a point north of Calais. The escorts of 121 Squadron and 401 Squadron were late and tried to rendezvous en route to the ships but missed them and turned back to search for the Swordfish at Manston. The Spitfires of 72 Squadron flying close escort sighted the German ships at but were bounced by Bf 109s and FW 190s and lost contact with the Swordfish. The first section of three torpedo-bombers pressed on through the destroyer screen and Esmonde&#x27;s aircraft was shot down before he could launch his torpedo. The other two aircraft continued through the German anti-aircraft barrage, dropped torpedoes and then ditched their aircraft which had been hit by flak. The second section of three Swordfish were seen to cross over the destroyer screen and disappear in the cloud and smoke. While the German fighter escorts were absent, two sections (eight aircraft) of 452 Squadron RAAF strafed several German ships and silenced the return fire of a destroyer, for a cracked perspex hood to one Spitfire.
The five operational Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) based at Dover left harbour at and sighted the German warships at The RAF fighter cover for this attack was not airborne in time, one MTB had engine-trouble and the rest found their approach blocked by twelve E-boats in two lines. The defective MTB fired torpedoes at the extreme range of before returning to Dover; the rest were not able to get much closer and torpedoed through the gap between the E-boat lines, mistakenly claiming a hit on &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. Two motor gun boats (MGBs) arrived from Dover in time to defend the last MTB from a German Narvik-class destroyer. Two more MTBs had left Ramsgate at but approached from too far astern of the German squadron and were unable to get into a position to attack before deteriorating weather and engine problems forced them to turn back.

Several Whirlwind fighters on a routine patrol were intercepted by the fighter screen at The seven Beauforts at Thorney Island were closest to the Brest Group when it was sighted. Two Beauforts had been bombed up and one went unserviceable, before the other four took off at The four Beauforts were late to meet their fighter escorts at Manston and the torpedo-bombers and fighters were ordered independently to the German ships. The position, course and speed of the Brest Group was given by voice (R/T) to the Spitfires and Morse (W/T) to the Beauforts. The torpedo-bombers failed to receive the orders, because 16 Group forgot that they had been fitted with R/T for Operation Fuller. When the Beauforts reached Manston they circled with numerous fighters which appeared to ignore them. Two Beauforts flew to the French coast, found nothing and landed at Manston where the confusion was resolved. The other two aircraft had already landed at Manston, where the crews found out what was going on and set off for the Belgian coast, arriving at (when the Nore Command destroyers were attacking). Both bombers flew through the German flak and attacked &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, dropping their torpedoes at , to no effect.

The 42 Squadron Beauforts from Scotland had to divert to RAF Coltishall in Norfolk because of snow but the torpedoes to be loaded were over 100 miles away at RAF North Coates in Lincolnshire and came by road too late. Nine of the aircraft had flown south with torpedoes on and took off at leaving the other four behind to rendezvous with their fighter escorts and several Hudsons, intended to create a diversion. The Beauforts reached Manston at and tried to formate behind the Hudsons, which did the same thing; attempts to get the fighters to join the formation also failed. The Beaufort crews had been briefed that they would be escorted all the way, the fighters that they were to cover the Dover Strait in general and the aircraft circled Manston for thirty minutes, each formation under the impression that another one was leading. The Beaufort commander then set off, using the position of the Brest Group given at Coltishall and six Hudsons followed, the other five circling and waiting for the fighters, before giving up and landing at 

The Beauforts and Hudsons flew towards the Dutch coast and lost touch in the cloud and rain but the Hudsons made ASV contact and attacked the ships, two being shot down for no result. Six of the Beauforts then attacked through the flak and released their torpedoes, also with no effect. (The other three Beauforts had already attacked, possibly against British destroyers.) The two 217 Squadron Beauforts that had flown earlier had reached Manston, set off again independently and made ASV contact, attacking &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; at The remaining Beauforts at St Eval in Cornwall had been sent to Thorney Island, arriving at to refuel and be briefed to link with fighters at Coltishall in East Anglia, where they arrived at to find no escorts waiting. The Beauforts pressed on to a position sent by wireless and at as dark fell, with visibility down to and the cloud base at only saw four German minesweepers. One bomber attacked a &quot;big ship&quot; but flak damage jammed the torpedo and as night fell around the rest turned for Coltishall; two Beauforts were lost to flak or the weather.

====Evening====
The first wave of Halifax and Stirling heavy bombers took off from and most found the target area from Thick low cloud and intermittent rain hid the view and only ten crews could see the German ships for long enough to bomb. The of the second wave took off from and reached the vicinity of the ships from and at least The last wave of began at and reached the Brest Group from and nine were able to drop their bombs. Only the aircraft that returned managed to attack the ships and were shot down by flak or lost after flying into the sea; twenty bombers were damaged and no hits were achieved.

The destroyers , of the 21st Flotilla and , , and of the 16th Flotilla (Captain Charles Pizey), from Nore Command were First World War-vintage and usually escorted east coast convoys. The ships were practising gunnery off Orford Ness in the North Sea when alerted at The destroyers sailed south to intercept the Brest Group but it steamed much faster than expected and to catch up, Pizey took the destroyers over a German minefield. At just before the destroyers attacked, north of the Scheldt Estuary, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; had hit a mine and was stopped for a short time, before resuming at about . At the destroyers made radar contact at and visual contact at at &quot;Walpole&quot; had already dropped out with engine trouble; as the other five emerged from the murk, they were immediately engaged by the German ships. The destroyers pressed on to and two destroyers fired torpedoes; &quot;Worcester&quot; closed further and was hit by return fire from &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, then the last two destroyers attacked but all their torpedoes missed.

====Night 12/13 and 13 February====
&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; had fallen behind after hitting a mine and at &quot;Gneisenau&quot; hit a magnetic mine off Terschelling. The mine exploded some distance from the ship, making a small hole on the starboard side and temporarily knocking a turbine out of action. After about thirty minutes, the ship continued at about and as &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; sailed through the same area, it hit another mine at both main engines stopped, steering was lost and fire control was damaged. The ship got under way with the starboard engines at making and carrying about of seawater. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; arrived at Wilhelmshaven at on 13 February, with damage that took three months to repair. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; reached the Elbe at and tied up at Brunsbüttel North Locks at After receiving Ultra intelligence about German minesweeping in the German Bight, Bomber Command had laid mines along the swept channel on 6 February and the next day. When the route of the channel was more accurately plotted on 11 February, four mines were laid, then more on 12 February when the Channel Dash was on. Enigma decrypts revealed the mining of the German ships but the news was kept secret by the British to protect the source.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

Ciliax sent a signal to Admiral Saalwächter in Paris on 13 February,

OKM called &quot;Cerberus&quot; a tactical victory and a strategic defeat. In 2012, Ken Ford wrote that the German ships had exchanged one prison for another and that Bomber Command raids from terminally damaged &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. Operation Fuller had failed, a British destroyer had been severely damaged and had been lost in fighter, and Command sorties. British public opinion was appalled and British prestige suffered at home and abroad. A leading article in &quot;The Times&quot; read,

In 1955, Hans Dieter Berenbrok, a former officer, writing under the pseudonym Cajus Bekker, judged the operation a necessity and a success. He quoted Raeder &quot;…we are all convinced we cannot leave the ships in Brest any longer&quot;. Raeder wrote that the operation was necessary because of a lack of training opportunities for the crews, lack of battle experience and the general situation made raiding operations in the &quot;old pattern out of the question&quot;. According to Bekker, Hitler and Raeder shared the conviction that if the ships remained in Brest that they would eventually be disabled by British air raids.

Stephen Roskill, the British naval official historian, wrote in 1956 that the German verdict was accurate. Hitler had exchanged the threat to British Atlantic convoys for a defensive deployment near Norway against a threat that never materialised. Roskill wrote that the British had misjudged the time of day when the German ships would sail but this mistake was less influential than the circumstantial failures of Coastal Command reconnaissance to detect the ships which had been at sea for four of them after dawn had broken, before the alarm was raised. Churchill ordered a Board of Enquiry (under Sir Alfred Bucknill), which criticised Coastal Command for failing to ensure that a dawn reconnaissance was flown to compensate for the problems of the night patrols off Brest and from Ushant to the Isle de Bréhat. The inquiry also held that there should have been more suspicion of the German radar jamming on the morning of 12 February and that involving Bomber Command in an operation for which it was untrained was a mistake.

The board found that the delay in detecting the German ships led to the British attacks being made piecemeal, against formidable German defensive arrangements and that the few aircraft and ships that found the group were &quot;cut to pieces&quot;. In 2012, Ken Ford wrote that the inquiry was, perforce, a whitewash, blaming instrument failures rather than incompetence but the report was still kept secret until 1946. In 1991, John Buckley wrote that the ASV Hudsons had been forbidden to use flares off Brest, because of the presence of &quot;Sealion&quot; and that one of the technical faults to an ASV could have been repaired, had the operator carried out a fuse check properly. Joubert was criticised for complacency, in not sending replacement sorties, despite his earlier warning that the Brest Group was about to sail, because of the assumption in Operation Fuller since 6 April 1941, that a day sailing was certain,

The Dash exposed many failings in RAF planning, that only three torpedo-bomber squadrons with were in Britain, that training had been limited by the lack of torpedoes and the example of Japanese tactics had been ignored. The effectiveness of Bomber Command against moving ships was shown to be negligible and the failure to ensure unity of command before Operation Fuller began, led to piecemeal attacks using unsuitable tactics.

R. V. Jones, Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science) at the Air Ministry during the war, wrote in his memoir, that for several days, army radar stations on the south coast had been jammed. Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace, a member of the army Radar Interception Unit, had reported this through the chain of command. On 11 February, Wallace had called for Jones to assist him in bringing attention to the German radar jamming. A gradual increase in the jamming had misled most operators to its intensity. Martini had unobtrusively made the British radar cover &quot;almost useless&quot;. Jones quoted Francis Bacon,

and included an anecdote of the chain of command breaking down under the shock of the Brest Group sailing so far up the Channel undiscovered. Air marshals were said to have sat on each other&#x27;s desks, thinking of pilots they could telephone to find the ships; even after the Brest Group had been found, contact was lost several times. In 1955, Jones met Captain Giessler, the Navigating Officer on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, who said that the worst time in the operation was the thirty minutes that &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was stationary, after hitting a mine just beyond Dover; in the low cloud none of the British aircraft found them. In the Official History of the Royal Canadian Air Force (1994) Brereton Greenhous et al. wrote that the Canadian 401 Squadron had been sent &quot;to intervene in a battle between German E-boats and British MTBs&quot;; 404 Squadron was ordered

and 411 Squadron had been ordered on an &quot;E-boat search&quot;. &quot;The &#x27;Channel block&#x27; had failed ignominiously&quot;.

In the German semi-official history &quot;Germany in the Second World War&quot; (2001), Werner Rahn wrote that the operation was a tactical success but that this could not disguise the fact of a strategic withdrawal. Brest was a location from which the had anticipated much success, especially after the Japanese entry into the war had diverted Allied resources to the Pacific, creating new opportunities for offensive action in the Atlantic. Rahn also noted that some members of the German Naval War Staff took the view that German war potential had reached its limit and that

In 2018, Craig Symonds wrote of the futility of keeping heavy units in Brest,

&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; later joined &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in Norwegian waters as a threat to Allied Arctic convoys of World War II supplying the USSR.

===Casualties===

British aircraft losses to the were two Blenheims, four Whirlwinds, four Wellingtons, six Hurricanes, nine Hampdens and ten Spitfires. gunners shot down all six Swordfish and a Hampden bomber. &quot;Worcester&quot; lost killed, four died of wounds and of the complement of ship was out of action for In 2014, Steve Brew recorded 230–250 killed and wounded. The torpedo boats &quot;Jaguar&quot; and damaged by bombing, two sailors were killed and several men were badly wounded by bomb splinters and small-arms fire; the lost 17 aircraft and eleven pilots. In 1996, Donald Caldwell gave 23 aircrew killed, four being fighter pilots from and that 22 aircraft were shot down, of which seven were fighters.

===Subsequent operations===


&quot;Gneisenau&quot; entered a floating dry dock at Kiel and was hit twice by RAF bombers, on the night of One bomb hit the battleship on her forecastle and penetrated the armoured deck. The explosion ignited a fire in the foremost magazine, which detonated, throwing the forward turret off its mount. The damage prompted the German Naval Staff to rebuild &quot;Gneisenau&quot; to mount the six guns originally planned, rather than repair the ship and the damaged bow section was removed to attach a longer one. By early 1943, the ship had been sufficiently repaired to begin the conversion but after the failure of German surface forces at the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942, Hitler ordered the work to stop. On 23 February, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was torpedoed by a British submarine off Norway and put out of action until October; then spent the rest of the war in the Baltic. On 28 March, the British raided St Nazaire in Operation Chariot and destroyed the &quot;Normandie&quot; dock, the only one in France capable of accommodating the largest German warships. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; participated in Operation Zitronella against Spitzbergen on 8 September 1943 and was sunk at the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December.

==Memorial and commemorations==

A granite memorial to all Britons involved in Operation Fuller was erected in Marine Parade Gardens in Dover, to mark the 70th Anniversary Remembrance of the event in 2012. Sailors from provided a Guard of Honour as part of the parade held to mark the unveiling.

On 10 February 2017, at the Fleet Air Arm memorial church at RNAS Yeovilton (HMS &quot;Heron&quot;), a ceremony and flypast by four Wildcat HMA2 helicopters of 825 Naval Air Squadron was conducted, marking the 75th anniversary of Lieutenant-Commander Esmonde and 825 Naval Air Squadron&#x27;s attack.

<doc id="579541" wikidata="Q207358" url="?curid=579541" title="João Havelange">
<text>Jean-Marie Faustin Godefroid &quot;João&quot; de Havelange (, ; 8 May 1916 – 16 August 2016) was a Brazilian lawyer, businessman, and athlete who was the seventh president of FIFA from 1974 to 1998. His tenure as president is the second longest in FIFA&#x27;s history, behind that of Jules Rimet. He received the title of honorary president when leaving office, but resigned in April 2013. He was preceded by Stanley Rous and succeeded by Sepp Blatter. Havelange served as a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1963 to 2011. He was the longest-serving active member upon his resignation. In July 2012, a Swiss prosecutor&#x27;s report revealed that, during his tenure on FIFA&#x27;s Executive Committee, he and his son-in-law Ricardo Teixeira took more than 41 million Swiss francs (£21m) in bribes in connection with the award of World Cup marketing rights.

==Early life, professional and Olympic career==
Havelange was born on 8 May 1916, in Rio de Janeiro, to an affluent family coming from Wallonia; his father, Faustin Havelange, had immigrated to Brazil from Liège, Belgium, worked as an arms dealer, and owned a large estate that stretched along the present-day districts of Laranjeiras, Cosme Velho and Santa Teresa. An excellent student at school, Havelange was accepted to the prestigious Law School of Fluminense Federal University, from which he graduated at the age of 24 with a BA in law. He worked as a legal advisor for bus company Auto Viação Jabaquara, and became president-director of another bus company, Viação Cometa S/A. He was also senior partner at chemical and metallurgical company Orwec Química e Metallurgia Ltda.

Interested in sports since his childhood years, at the age of 20 Havelange competed as a swimmer at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but failed to go beyond the heats of the 400m freestyle and 1500m freestyle events. He was also part of the Brazilian team that tied for 13th in water polo at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He was the chef de mission of the Brazilian delegation at the 1956 Summer Olympic Games in Melbourne.

==Sports administrator==
As president of the Metropolitan Swimming Federation in Brazil, Havelange became a member of the Brazilian Olympic Committee and joined the Union Cycliste Internationale in 1958. After becoming vice-president of the Brazilian Sports Confederation, he was president of the Confederation from 1958 to 1973.

==President of FIFA (1974–98)==
In 1974, Havelange defeated Englishman Stanley Rous for the presidency of FIFA, the governing body of world association football. Havelange became the first (and, to date, only) non-European to hold the post. He lobbied in 86 different countries for the presidency, often accompanied by Pelé. Sports marketer Patrick Nally said that &quot;Havelange had seen the future...he knew that if he became the president of the only federation already running its own high-profile world championship then he would enjoy huge economic power&quot;. Appealing to developing nations, Havelange promised an expanded World Cup, and a youth World Cup that they might be able to host.

Threatened by Havelange&#x27;s international campaign for the presidency, Rous asked Horst Dassler, then managing Adidas&#x27; French subsidiary to help his campaign. Dassler engaged in intense lobbying of the delegates at the 39th FIFA Congress, where the vote was to be held. The election went to a second round, and Havelange won by sixteen votes.

Havelange did not have sufficient money to fund his programme for FIFA, so he sought financial support from Dassler, who wished to supply Adidas branded equipment to the national federations. Supported by sports marketer Patrick Nally, Havelange enlisted Adidas and Coca-Cola as primary sponsors of FIFA tournaments.

The support of commercial organizations was crucial to the future of Havelange and FIFA, and provided a model for global sporting federations. Nally stated that:
The sale of television rights increased greatly under Havelange&#x27;s leadership. In 1987 the European rights to the next three FIFA World Cups were sold for $440 million, the non-United States rights for the three tournaments from 1998 sold for $2.2 billion. Under Havelange&#x27;s presidency the FIFA World Cup expanded from 16 to 32 teams, with Havelange overseeing six world cups during his time in office. The FIFA U-17 World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup were all introduced under his tenure.

===Associates Lacoste and de Andrade===
The head of the Argentina&#x27;s 1978 FIFA World Cup organizing committee, Omar Actis, was assassinated in August 1976. Awarded the World Cup in 1966, Argentina did little to prepare for the event before the 1976 Argentine coup d&#x27;état that saw a military junta rule the country. In 1982 Carlos Lacoste, former de facto President of Argentina during the junta, became vice-president of FIFA. Lacoste had previously been head of the organising committee for the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina and was cousin of de facto President Jorge Rafael Videla. Democratic rule was restored to Argentina in 1983 and Lacoste was investigated for corruption.

Havelange was also an associate of Brazilian criminal Castor de Andrade, head of an illegal gambling association. Andrade was sentenced to six years in prison in 1994 for racketeering. Havelange wrote a character reference for Andrade in 1987 as &quot;amiable and pleasant ... predominant feature .. loyalty .. good family man, a devoted friend, and is admired as a sports administrator&quot;. &quot;I authorize Castor de Andrade to use this statement as he deems appropriate&quot;. Police investigating Andrade found this reference and evidence that Andrade had provided Havelange with a box at the Rio Carnival.

===Associates Pelé and Teixeira===
Havelange&#x27;s daughter, Lucia, was married to the Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira for 30 years. They divorced in 1997. Teixeira was President of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) between 1989 and 2012. A financier, Teixeira had no previous experience of sports administration.

In 1993, angry when his television company was rejected in a contest for domestic rights, Brazilian footballer Pelé accused Teixeira of corruption, resulting in an eight-year feud between Pelé and Havelange. Consequently, Havelange banned Pelé from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms over the ban were perceived to have negatively affected Havelange&#x27;s chances of re-election as FIFA President in 1994. As in 1974, Havelange embarked on an intense lobbying mission, with the aim of securing votes from the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and the Central American, North American and Caribbean Football Confederation (CONCACAF). The loyalty of these &quot;third world&quot; football federations was rewarded by the expansion of the World Cup from 24 to 32 teams for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. As a result of the expansion and allocation of places, tension grew between the governing body of European football (UEFA) and the FIFA leadership.

As Brazilian Minister for Sports, Pelé drafted legislation approved as the Pelé Law in December 1997 by the lower house of the Brazilian congress. Football clubs had to become companies within two years, giving players greater freedom of contract and limiting the power of the Brazilian Football Confederation. Havelange threatened to ban Brazil from the 1998 FIFA World Cup if the law passed.

===FIFA Presidential elections===
At the 1994 meeting of the FIFA Executive Committee in New York, Havelange was criticized for his allocation of appointments to FIFA&#x27;s standing committees. Havelange postponed a discussion on the appointments, distributed a list with the new composition of the committees, and declared the list passed without a vote. In 1998 Havelange announced that he would stand down as FIFA president after 24 years in charge. He told British Prime Minister Tony Blair he wanted England to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The English Football Association had pledged support to Lennart Johansson in the forthcoming FIFA Presidential election, whereas Havelange supported FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter. Johansson was in favour of honouring a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement&quot; between the English and German football associations, that Germany would not oppose England&#x27;s bid for the 1996 European Football Championship, and England would not oppose Germany&#x27;s bid for the 2006 World Cup.

Johansson said &quot;The dumbest thing about breaking the agreement is that we&#x27;re faced with an expensive competition. We would be better off spending the money on real soccer.&quot; Johansson criticized Havelange&#x27;s financial decisions and &quot;undemocratic behaviour.&quot; At a meeting of the FIFA Executive Committee, Johansson demanded Sepp Blatter resign as FIFA General Secretary if he planned to run for the presidency of FIFA. Havelange rejected the demand and ended the meeting before a vote could be taken, described as &quot;a defeat for democracy&quot; by Johansson. If elected, Johansson planned that an independent accountant would examine FIFA&#x27;s business practices under Havelange. Blatter was elected by 111 to 80 votes, amid claims of bribery.

==Corruption==
In 1999 &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; reported that Havelange accepted gifts of diamonds, bicycles, sports articles, Delft blue porcelain, paintings and art books, in connection with Amsterdam&#x27;s failed bid for the 1992 Summer Olympic Games. &quot;I remember it very well because he had special wishes, wishes which were in conflict with the IOC laws,&quot; said Peter Kronenberg, who headed the press office of the Amsterdam Olympic Games 1992 Foundation.

===Collapse of ISL===
Disagreements between Nally and Dassler led to the foundation of International Sport and Leisure (ISL) in 1982. Dassler, French businessman Andre Guelfi, and Japanese advertising firm Dentsu established ISL to help market the rights for the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. Dassler&#x27;s proximity to Havelange, and his support for Juan Antonio Samaranch, the President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) enabled ISL to win lucrative future World Cup and Olympic contracts. Following Dassler&#x27;s death in 1987, and the departure of key executives, ISL overpaid for sports rights in the 1990s, and was declared bankrupt in 2001. From 1989 to 2001, ISL paid 185 million Swiss francs (CHF) in &quot;personal commissions&quot; to sports officials and other people involved in the marketing of sports rights. In the 2008 fraud trial that arose from the collapse of ISL, a judge referred to the commissions as &quot;schmiergeld&quot;, a German word for bribery.

In May 2006 British investigative reporter Andrew Jennings&#x27; book &quot;Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals&quot; implicated Havelange in the collapse of ISL, and revealed that some football officials were urged to secretly repay the commissions they received. In 2011 Jennings told Brazil&#x27;s Senate that Havelange may have amassed $50 million or more in bribes, through a front company called Sicuretta.

An IOC ethics committee was announced in June 2011 to investigate claims that Havelange received a bribe of $1 million in connection with ISL. The investigation was prompted by Jennings&#x27; claims in &quot;FIFA&#x27;s Shame&quot;, an episode of &quot;Panorama&quot; broadcast on BBC One in May 2011. Days before the ethics committee was set to happen, Havelange resigned as a member of the IOC, citing health concerns. The investigation was closed, with reports that it would have suspended the membership of Havelange for two years. In November 2011 Jennings accused Havelange of being one of the people who collectively paid 5.5 million CHF to close the 2008 ISL fraud trial.

In July 2012, after protracted court proceedings, Havelange and Teixeira were named as beneficiaries of bribes from ISL. A prosecutor in the canton of Zug revealed a document saying that, from 1992 to 2000, Havelange and Teixeira were paid 41m CHF by ISL. Teixeira had resigned from FIFA in March 2012. In 2012 Sepp Blatter said that at the time of this payment, commercial bribery was not a crime in Switzerland. In 1997, as President of FIFA, Havelange had granted ISL FIFA&#x27;s exclusive marketing rights, and exclusive TV and radio rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cups in 1998. ISL paid FIFA 200m CHF for the marketing rights and $1.4 billion for the TV rights. After ISL&#x27;s bankruptcy, its liquidators examined all payments made by the company.

===FIFA involvement===
FIFA, under the presidency of Sepp Blatter, was found to have known about the bribes, yet argued it did not need to have the money repaid. Prosecutions were mounted for alleged embezzlement against Havelange and Teixeira, but were stopped in May 2010, after Havelange and Texeira repaid CHF500,000 and CHF2.5m respectively. The repayments were considered reasonable, because bribes paid before 1995 were outside the statute of limitations and Havelange was now over 90 years old. The prosecutor also believed that Havelange and Teixeira were guilty of criminal breaches of their duties to serve FIFA as senior executives. Following the release of the report, Blatter vowed to strip Havelange of his honorary presidency at the next FIFA Congress.

==Health issues and death==
In March and April 2012, Havelange was hospitalized for a seriously infected right ankle in Rio de Janeiro, which necessitated a period in intensive care. In April 2013 he resigned from his position as FIFA&#x27;s Honorary President for &quot;health and personal reasons&quot;. Havelange was again admitted to hospital in June 2014, for a lung infection, and in November 2015 with respiratory problems. He died at 5:00 BRT on 16 August 2016 at the age of 100 in Rio de Janeiro during the 2016 Summer Olympics which were being held there.

==Assessment==

Writing in June 1998, as Havelange was leaving FIFA, and before the eruption of most of the controversies surrounding him, &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented on Havelange&#x27;s leadership:

==Honors==
Havelange was elected honorary president of FIFA in 1998, but resigned in 2013. On August 24, 2006, Havelange was named honorary Vice President of the Brazilian Ice Sports Federation (CBDG) for his support in the development of winter sports in Brazil.

<text>William Desmond Taylor (born William Cunningham Deane-Tanner; 26 April 1872 – 1 February 1922) was an Anglo-Irish-American film director and actor. A popular figure in the growing Hollywood motion picture colony of the 1910s and early 1920s, Taylor directed fifty-nine silent films between 1914 and 1922 and acted in twenty-seven between 1913 and 1915.

Taylor&#x27;s murder on 1 February 1922, along with other Hollywood scandals such as the Roscoe Arbuckle trial, led to a frenzy of sensationalist and often fabricated newspaper reports. The murder remains an official cold case.

==Early life==

William Cunningham Deane-Tanner was born into the Anglo-Irish gentry on 26 April 1872, at Evington House, Carlow, County Carlow, Ireland, one of five children of a retired British Army officer, Major Thomas Kearns Deane-Tanner of the Carlow Rifles, 8th Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, and his wife, Jane O&#x27;Brien. Taylor&#x27;s siblings were Denis Gage Deane-Tanner, Ellen &quot;Nell&quot; Deane-Tanner Faudel-Phillips, Lizzie &quot;Daisy&quot; Deane-Tanner, and Oswald Kearns Deane-Tanner. One of his uncles was Charles Kearns Deane Tanner, the Irish Parliamentary Party Member of Parliament for Mid Cork.

From 1885 to 1887, Taylor attended Marlborough College in England. In 1891, he left Ireland for a dude ranch near Runnymede, Kansas, United States. There, Taylor became reacquainted with acting (his first experiences being at school) and eventually moved to New York City.

While in New York, Taylor courted Ethel May Hamilton, an actress who had appeared in the stage musical &quot;Florodora&quot; under the name Ethel May Harrison. Hamilton&#x27;s father was a broker and an investor in the English antiques store on Fifth Avenue, the Antique Shoppe, which eventually employed Taylor. The couple married in an Episcopal ceremony on 7 December 1901 at the Little Church Around the Corner, and had a daughter, Ethel Daisy, in 1902 or 1903.

Taylor and his family were well-known in New York society and were members of several clubs. He was also a heavy drinker, possibly suffered from depression, and was known to carry on affairs with women. Taylor suddenly disappeared on 23 October 1908, deserting his wife and daughter. After his disappearance, friends said he had previously suffered &quot;mental lapses&quot;, and his family thought initially he had wandered off during an episode of amnesia. Taylor&#x27;s wife obtained a state decree of divorce in 1912.

Little is known of the years immediately following Taylor&#x27;s disappearance. He travelled through Canada, Alaska and the northwestern U.S., mining gold and working with various acting troupes. Eventually, he switched from acting to producing. By the time he arrived in San Francisco, California around 1912, he had changed his name to William Desmond Taylor; in San Francisco, some New York acquaintances met him, and provided him with some money to re-establish himself in Los Angeles.

==Hollywood==
Taylor&#x27;s initial film acting was in 1913 for the New York Motion Picture Company, releasing under the brands of Bronco and Kay-Bee. His earliest known screen appearance was in &quot;The Counterfeiter&quot;. He then acted for Vitagraph Studios, including four appearances opposite Margaret &quot;Gibby&quot; Gibson, and Balboa Amusement Producing Company. At Balboa, Taylor met actress Neva Gerber with whom he became engaged until 1919. Gerber later recalled, &quot;He was the soul of honour, a man of personal culture, education, and refinement. I have never known a finer or better man.&quot;

Taylor began directing films in 1914, beginning with &quot;The Judge&#x27;s Wife&quot; for Balboa. After leaving Balboa he directed two films at Favorite Players Film Co. and then American Film Manufacturing Company, where he directed most of the 30-episode serial &quot;The Diamond from the Sky&quot;. In October 1915 he joined Pallas Pictures. A year later Pallas became a subsidiary of Famous Players–Lasky. Except for a month working at Fox Film Corporation in 1917, all of Taylor&#x27;s subsequent films were directed for Famous Players–Lasky or its subsidiary companies.

Around 1915, Taylor made contact with a sister-in-law, Ada Brennan Deane-Tanner, wife of Taylor&#x27;s younger brother Denis. A former British Army lieutenant and manager of a New York antiques business (separate from Hamilton&#x27;s), Denis had also abandoned his wife and children, disappearing in 1912. Ada and her daughters moved to Monrovia, California, where Ada could be treated at the Pottinger Sanitorium for tuberculosis. Ada&#x27;s sister, Lillian Pomeroy, was married to the sanitorium&#x27;s physician in charge, Dr. John L. Pomeroy. This would become public after Taylor&#x27;s murder, and the press descended upon the little town of Monrovia.

Towards the end of World War I, in July 1918, Taylor enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force as a private. After training for four and a half months at Fort Edward, Nova Scotia, Taylor sailed from Halifax on a troop transport carrying 500 Canadian soldiers. They arrived at Hounslow Barracks, London on 2 December 1918.

Taylor was ultimately assigned to the Royal Army Service Corps of the Expeditionary Forces Canteen Service, stationed at Dunkirk, and promoted to the temporary grade of lieutenant on 15 January 1919. At the end of April 1919, Taylor reached his final billet at Bergues, France, as Major Taylor, Company D, Royal Fusiliers. Upon returning to Los Angeles on 14 May 1919, Taylor was honoured by the Motion Picture Directors Association with a formal banquet at the Los Angeles Athletic Club.

After returning from military service, Taylor went on to direct some of the most popular stars of the era, including Mary Pickford, Wallace Reid, Dustin Farnum and his protégée, Mary Miles Minter, who starred in the 1919 version of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. By this time, Taylor&#x27;s ex-wife and daughter were aware that he was working in Hollywood. In 1918, while watching the film &quot;Captain Alvarez&quot;, they saw Taylor appear on the screen. Ethel responded, &quot;That&#x27;s your father!&quot; In response, Ethel Daisy wrote Taylor in care of the studio. In 1921, Taylor visited his ex-wife and daughter in New York City and made Ethel Daisy his legal heir.

==Murder==
At 7:30 on the morning of Thursday, 2 February 1922, Taylor&#x27;s body was found inside his bungalow at the Alvarado Court Apartments, 404-B South Alvarado Street, in Westlake, Los Angeles, a trendy and affluent neighbourhood. A crowd gathered inside, and someone identifying himself as a doctor stepped forward, made a cursory examination of the body, and declared Taylor had died of a stomach hemorrhage. The doctor was never seen again, and when doubts later arose, the body was rolled over by forensic investigators, revealing that the 49-year-old film director had been shot at least once in the back with what appeared to have been a small-caliber pistol, which was not found at the scene.

===Funeral===
Taylor&#x27;s funeral took place on 7 February 1922, in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. After an Episcopal ceremony, he was interred in a mausoleum at Hollywood Cemetery, now named Hollywood Forever Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boulevard. The inscription on his crypt reads, &quot;In Memory of William C. Deane-Tanner, Beloved Father of Ethel Deane-Tanner. Died 1 February 1922.&quot;

==Investigation==
In Taylor&#x27;s pockets, investigators found a wallet holding US$78 in cash (modern day $), a silver cigarette case, a Waltham pocket watch, a pen knife, and a locket bearing a photograph of actress Mabel Normand. A two-carat diamond ring was on his finger. With the evidence of the money and valuables on Taylor&#x27;s body, robbery did not seem to be the motive for the killing, but a large sum of cash, that Taylor had shown to his accountant the day before, was missing and apparently never accounted for. After some investigation, the time of Taylor&#x27;s death was set at 7:50 pm on the evening of 1 February 1922.

While being interviewed by the police five days after the director&#x27;s body was found, Minter said that, following the murder, her friend, director and actor Marshall Neilan, had told her that Taylor had made several highly &quot;delusional&quot; statements about some of his social acquaintances (including her) during the weeks before his death. She also said that Neilan thought Taylor had recently become &quot;insane&quot;.

In the midst of a media circus caused by the case, Los Angeles Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz warned &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter Eddie Doherty, &quot;The industry has been hurt. Stars have been ruined. Stockholders have lost millions of dollars. A lot of people are out of jobs and incensed enough to take a shot at you.&quot; According to Robert Giroux, &quot;The studios seemed to be fearful that if certain aspects of the case were exposed, it would exacerbate their problems.&quot; King Vidor said of the case in 1968: &quot;Last year I interviewed a Los Angeles police detective, William Michael Cahill Sr., now retired, who had been assigned to the case immediately after the murder. He told me, &#x27;We were doing all right and then, before a week was out, we got the word to lay off.&#x27;&quot;

===Suspects and witnesses===
====Edward Sands====
Edward F. Sands had prior convictions for embezzlement, forgery, and serial desertion from the U.S. military. Born in Ohio, he had multiple aliases and spoke with an affected cockney accent. Sands had worked as Taylor&#x27;s valet and cook until seven months before the murder. While Taylor was in Europe the summer before in 1921, Sands had forged his name on cheques and wrecked his car. Later, Sands burgled Taylor&#x27;s bungalow, leaving footprints on the film director&#x27;s bed. Following the murder, Sands was never seen or heard from again.

====Henry Peavey====
Henry Peavey, who replaced Sands as Taylor&#x27;s valet, was the person who found the body. Newspapers noted that Peavey wore flashy golf costumes, but did not own any golf clubs. Three days before Taylor&#x27;s murder, Peavey had been arrested for &quot;social vagrancy&quot; and charged with being &quot;lewd and dissolute&quot;.

According to Robert Giroux:

 In 1931, Peavey died in a San Francisco asylum where he had been hospitalized for syphilis-related dementia.

====Mabel Normand====
Mabel Normand was a popular comedic actress and frequent costar with Charlie Chaplin and Roscoe Arbuckle. According to author Robert Giroux, Taylor was deeply in love with Normand and she had originally approached him for help to cure her cocaine dependency. Based upon Normand&#x27;s subsequent statements to police investigators, her repeated relapses were devastating for Taylor. According to Giroux, Taylor met with federal prosecutors shortly before his death and offered to testify against Normand&#x27;s cocaine suppliers. Giroux believed that those suppliers learned of the meeting and hired a contract killer to assassinate the director. According to Giroux, Normand suspected the reasons for her lover&#x27;s murder but did not know the identity of the triggerman.

On the night of the murder, Normand claimed to have left Taylor&#x27;s bungalow in a happy mood at 7:45 pm, carrying a book he had lent her. She and Taylor blew kisses to each other as her limousine drove her away. Normand was the last person known to have seen Taylor alive, and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) subjected her to a gruelling interrogation but ruled her out as a suspect. Most subsequent writers have done the same. However, Normand&#x27;s career had already slowed, and her reputation was tarnished by revelations of her addiction, which was seen as a moral failing. According to George Hopkins, who sat next to her at Taylor&#x27;s funeral, Normand wept inconsolably throughout the ceremony.

Ultimately, Normand continued to make films throughout the 1920s. She died of tuberculosis eight years later, on 23 February 1930. According to her friend and confidante Julia Brew, Normand asked her a few days before she died: &quot;Julia, do you think they&#x27;ll ever find out who killed Bill Taylor?&quot;

==== Mary Miles Minter ====
Mary Miles Minter was a former child star and teen screen idol whose career had been guided by Taylor. Minter, who had grown up without a father, was only three years older than the daughter Taylor had abandoned in New York. Love letters from Minter were found in Taylor&#x27;s bungalow. Based upon those, reporters alleged that a sexual relationship between the 49-year-old Taylor and 19-year-old Minter had started when she was 17. Giroux and Vidor, however, disputed that allegation. Citing Minter&#x27;s own statements, both believed that her love for Taylor was unrequited. Taylor had often declined to see Minter, and had described himself as too old for her.

However, facsimiles of Minter&#x27;s passionate letters to Taylor were printed in newspapers, forever shattering her screen image as a modest and wholesome young girl, and she was vilified in the press. Minter made four more films for Paramount Pictures, and when the studio failed to renew her contract, she received offers from many other producers. Never comfortable as an actress, Minter declined them all. In 1957, she married Brandon O. Hildebrandt, a Danish-American businessman. She died in Santa Monica, California, on 4 August 1984.

====Charlotte Shelby====
Charlotte Shelby was Minter&#x27;s mother. Like many stage mothers before and since, she has been described as manipulative and consumed by wanton greed over her daughter&#x27;s career. Minter and her mother were bitterly divided by financial disputes and lawsuits for a time, but they later reconciled. Shelby&#x27;s initial statements to police about the murder are still characterized as evasive and &quot;obviously filled with lies&quot; about both her daughter&#x27;s relationship with Taylor and &quot;other matters&quot;. Perhaps the most compelling bit of circumstantial evidence was that Shelby allegedly owned a rare .38 calibre pistol and some unusual bullets, which were very similar to the kind which had killed Taylor. After that information became public, she reportedly threw the pistol into a Louisiana bayou.

Shelby knew the Los Angeles district attorney socially and spent years outside the United States, in an effort to avoid both official inquiries by his successor, and press coverage related to the murder. In 1938, her other daughter, actress Margaret Shelby (who was by then suffering from both clinical depression and alcoholism), openly accused her mother of the murder. Shelby was widely suspected of the crime and was a favourite suspect of many writers. For example, Adela Rogers St. Johns speculated that Shelby was torn by feelings of maternal protection for her daughter and her own attraction to Taylor.

Although Shelby feared being tried for the murder, at least two Los Angeles County district attorneys publicly declined to prosecute her. Almost twenty years after the murder, Los Angeles district attorney, Buron Fitts, concluded evidence was insufficient for an indictment of Shelby and recommended that the remaining evidence and case files be retained on a permanent basis. All of those materials subsequently disappeared. Shelby died in 1957. Fitts, in ill health, died by suicide in 1973.

====Margaret Gibson====
Margaret Gibson was a film actress who had worked with Taylor when he first came to Hollywood. In 1917, she was indicted, tried, and acquitted on charges equivalent to prostitution (along with allegations of opium dealing), after which she changed her professional name to Patricia Palmer. In 1923, Gibson was arrested and jailed on extortion charges, which were later dropped. She was 27 years old and in Los Angeles at the time of Taylor&#x27;s murder. No record of her name was ever mentioned in connection with the investigation. Soon after the murder, Gibson got work in a number of films produced by Famous Players–Lasky, Taylor&#x27;s studio at the time of his death. Shortly before she died in 1964, Gibson reportedly confessed to murdering Taylor.

===Lack of evidence===
Through a combination of poor crime scene management and apparent corruption, much physical evidence was immediately lost, and the rest vanished over the years, although copies of a few documents from the police files were made public in 2007. Various theories were put forward after the murder, and in the years since, and many books published, claiming to have identified the murderer, but no conclusive evidence has ever been uncovered linking the crime to any particular individual.

==Aftermath==
Because so many of the celebrities mentioned in the Taylor case were familiar to the public through their movie performances, this was the first American murder in which so many people felt such a personal interest. Public interest in the case resulted in stories about the Taylor murder selling more newspapers in the United States than ever before.

Anti-Hollywood sentiment peaked in the weeks following the Taylor murder, with editorials comparing Hollywood to &quot;all the licentiousness that marked the Roman times of Caligula, Claudius, and Nero,&quot; &quot;our American Sodom and Gomorrah,&quot; and sounding the call to &quot;Destroy Hollywood!&quot; Other editorials characterized Taylor as a crafty, cultured villain who &quot;got what was coming to him,&quot; and urging, &quot;Every weapon available should be used by all the forces of law to defeat the conspiracy to cover up the Taylor case.&quot;

A spate of newspaper-driven Hollywood scandals during the early 1920s included Taylor&#x27;s murder, the Roscoe Arbuckle trial, the death of Olive Thomas, the mysterious death of Thomas H. Ince, and the drug- or alcohol-related deaths of Wallace Reid, Barbara La Marr, and Jeanne Eagels, all of which prompted Hollywood studios to begin writing contracts with &quot;morality clauses&quot; or &quot;moral turpitude clauses&quot;, allowing the dismissal of contractees who breached them.

==In popular culture==
* The murder appears in F Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1940 story &quot;Pat Hobby&#x27;s Christmas Wish&quot;. Hobby discovers a supposed confession to the murder from a Hollywood producer and tries to use it to blackmail him.
* The film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), with William Holden and Gloria Swanson, features a fictional, ageing silent screen actress named &quot;Norma Desmond&quot;, whose name was taken from Taylor&#x27;s middle name and Mabel Normand&#x27;s last name, as a way to resonate with the widely publicized scandals of almost 30 years before.
* The film &quot;Hollywood Story&quot; (1951), an attempt by Universal Pictures to take advantage of the success of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, is clearly based directly on the Taylor murder. While the film reaches a fictional conclusion, it follows the circumstances of the real-life event closely.
* Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1990) features a fictionalised account of the Taylor murder. Other novels that fictionalize the case include &quot;13 Castle Walk&quot; by DeWitt Bodeen (1975), &quot;The Man Who Died Twice&quot; by Samuel A. Peeples (1976), and &quot;Running Time&quot; by Gavin Lambert (1982).
* Taylor&#x27;s murder was depicted in David Merrick&#x27;s production of the Jerry Herman - Michael Stewart &quot;cult&quot; musical &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot;, which opened on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre on 6 October 1974, and ran for six previews and 66 regular performances. Directed and choreographed by Gower Champion, the production starred Robert Preston as Mack Sennett and Bernadette Peters as Mabel Normand, with James Mitchell portraying William Desmond Taylor.
* &quot;Old Hollywood: Silent Stars, Deadly Secret&quot;, an episode of the A&amp;E true crime series &quot;City Confidential&quot;, aired in 2000 and is about the Taylor murder.
* In 2012, to mark the 140th anniversary of his birth, The William Desmond Taylor Society, in his home town of Carlow, Ireland, established Taylorfest, an annual arts and film festival honouring Ireland&#x27;s most prolific filmmaker and celebrating the contribution of the Irish to silent film.
* TinPot and Cleverality Productions produced, with funding from The Broadcast Authority of Ireland, a one-hour drama-documentary examining the murder of William Desmond Taylor presented in the style of a 1920s live radio show entitled &quot;Who Killed Bill?&quot; (2013). Written and directed by Marc-Ivan O&#x27;Gorman, the show combined dramatizations with interviews from experts, including Oscar-winning film historian Kevin Brownlow.
* In 2018, Buzzfeed Unsolved produced a video discussing &quot;The Scandalous Murder of William Desmond Taylor&quot;.
* In 2020, Wondery released a six-episode podcast series &quot;Murder in Hollywoodland&quot; about the murder.

<text>Senecioneae is the largest tribe of the Asteraceae, or the sunflower family, comprising over 150 genera and over 3,500 species. Almost one-third of the species in this tribe are placed in the genus &quot;Senecio&quot;. Its members exhibit probably the widest possible range of form to be found in the entire plant kingdom, and include annuals, minute creeping alpines, herbaceous and evergreen perennials, shrubs, climbers, succulents, trees, and semi-aquatic plants.

Plants in this tribe are responsible for more livestock poisonings than all other plants combined. Its members usually contain liver and kidney toxic and carcinogenic unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids in &quot;Senecio&quot; and furanoeremophilanes in &quot;Tetradymia&quot;.

A number of species are well known in horticulture.

== Classification ==
Since the time of Bentham, the &quot;premier systematic botanist of the nineteenth century&quot;,
considerable efforts have been made to classify and understand the striking morphological diversity in the Senecioneae.
The traditional view of the tribe has been that of one huge genus &quot;Senecio&quot; plus many other genera which exhibit varying degrees of distinctiveness. 
Circumscription and delimitation of the tribe have experienced expansions and contractions over the decades as genera and groups of genera have been moved in and out,
as was the case for &quot;Arnica&quot;, &quot;Liabum&quot;, &quot;Munnozia&quot;, &quot;Schistocarpha&quot;, etc. which have since then been excluded.
Of the several potential causes for this constant redefinition the greatest is probably that little is known about its intergeneric relationships or a lack of phylogenetic understanding enhanced by the other problems of conflicting clues from morphological characters, the large size of the tribe, the absence of a precise delimitation or circumscription of &quot;Senecio&quot; and the naturalness of these assemblages combined with the imprecise boundaries of the different species themselves.

Many segregate genera have been recognized in recent studies, often with circumscriptions derived from selected representative species. Whether the recognition of numerous segregate genera provides a better taxonomy than treating the variation patterns as infrageneric taxa is yet unclear. A respectable case can be made for maintaining &quot;Senecio&quot; as a broad concept, at least until revisionary studies at the species level are carried out and the results subjected to critical analyses.
Most genera that have been removed from the Senecioneae in the broadest sense have come to rest within the Liabeae or within a broadly circumscribed Heliantheae (e.g., allies in the Arnicinae, Chaenactidinae, or Madiinae; &quot;Haploesthes&quot; in the Flaveriinae; and &quot;Raillardella&quot; and allies in the Madiinae). Additional information may be found in B. G. Baldwin et al. (2002), H. Robinson (1981), B. Nordenstam (1977–1978) and K. Bremer (1994).

<doc id="579552" wikidata="Q9506" url="?curid=579552" title="HMCS Onondaga">
<text>HMCS &quot;Onondaga&quot; (S73) is an that served in the Royal Canadian Navy and later the Canadian Forces. Built in the mid-1960s, &quot;Onondaga&quot; operated primarily with the Maritime Forces Atlantic until her decommissioning in 2000 as the last Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;.

Several plans for the disposal of the submarine were made and cancelled before the Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-Père in Rimouski purchased the boat for preservation as a museum vessel. The submarine was moved into location during 2008, and is open to the public.

==Design and construction==
The &quot;Oberon&quot; class were considered an improved version of the preceding &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarines, with a different frame of the pressure hull and constructed from a better grade of steel. These build differences allowed the &quot;Oberon&quot;s to have a deeper diving depth at roughly .

The submarines displaced surfaced and submerged. They measured long with a beam of and a draught of .

The boats were powered by a two shaft diesel-electric system. The &quot;Oberon&quot;s were equipped with two ASR 1 16-cylinder diesel engines creating and two English Electric motors creating . This gave the submarines a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . The boats carried 258 tons of oil giving them a range of at 12 knots.

The design was armed with eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, six in the bow and two in the stern. They carried 24 reloads for a total of 30 torpedoes. Canadian boats differed from the original design by being equipped for the US Mark 37C torpedo. The longer, wire-guided Mod 2 version was carried in the forward tubes and the non-guided Mod 0 for the rear tubes.

The &quot;Oberon&quot;s were equipped with Type 187 active-passive sonar, Type 2007 passive sonar and Type 2019 sonar.

===Submarine Operational Update Program (SOUP)===
By the late 1970s, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s in Canadian service had become obsolete and were in need of an update. Planning was done in 1978 and the program approved in February 1979. In an effort to take the subs from anti-submarine warfare training to frontline service, Maritime Command developed a refit program that included new sonars, periscopes, communications and fire-control systems. They also had their armament upgraded with the fitting of torpedo tubes capable of firing the Mk 48 torpedo. This would allow the submarines to be deployed by NATO in the North Atlantic to monitor Soviet submarines.

The SOUP refits comprised a new US fire control system, a digital Singer Librascope Mark I, and new Sperry passive ranging sonar with the Type 719 short range sonar removed. The new sonar was placed in the upper casing on the pressure hull. New communications and navigational systems were installed. The submarines were fitted with new torpedo tubes for Mark 48 torpedoes, however the torpedoes themselves were considered a separate procurement program, which was only finalized in 1985.

Between 1980 and 1986, one of the Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s was out of service undergoing the refit. SOUP came in on time and on its budget of C$45 million in 1986. SOUP kept the Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s operating until the end of the 1990s when they were replaced by the British s.

==Acquisition==
In March 1962, the Cabinet recommended the purchase of three &quot;Oberon&quot;s and eight frigates, on the condition that the cost of acquiring the submarines from the United Kingdom would be offset by British defence purchases in Canada. On 11 April 1962, the purchase was announced in the House of Commons of Canada by the Minister of National Defence, Douglas Harkness.

However, the Conservative government postponed the acquisition of the &quot;Oberon&quot;s due to the slow speed of the United Kingdom&#x27;s attempt to offset the acquisition. The Conservative government was defeated in 1963 and the incoming Liberal government suspended all major defence procurement projects upon taking power. The final price of C$40 million for the entire contract was agreed upon in 1963.

Since &quot;Onyx&quot; was already under construction, the boat was finished to Royal Navy specifications. All three boats received modifications to the original &quot;Oberon&quot; design, which included the enlargement of the snort de-icer, a different weapons fit, a larger air conditioning unit, active sonar and different communications equipment. The second and third hulls were built to Canadian specifications, which moved the galley forward of the control room to make room for the sonar equipment. This led to the removal of three crew bunks, a problem that was never rectified in the submarines and led to an accommodation issue for the crew. The three submarines were acquired for service as &quot;clockwork mice&quot;, submarines used to train surface vessels in anti-submarine warfare.

==Construction and career==
The submarine, built at Chatham Dockyard in England, was laid down on 18 June 1964, and launched on 25 September 1965. She was commissioned at Chatham on 22 June 1967. The submarine was named after the Onondaga First Nations people, and was assigned the pennant number S 73. The submarine cost C$16,000,000.

&quot;Onondaga&quot; was assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) as part of the First Canadian Submarine Squadron and served nearly her entire career in the North Atlantic. &quot;Onondoga&quot; spent time training with the Royal Navy after an exchange program was instituted in the 1960s that would see submarines from both the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy spend time with each other&#x27;s forces. This allowed Canadian submarines on intelligence-gathering missions. Beginning in the 1970s, Canada began underwater surveillance patrols in the western Atlantic, tracking Soviet sub and surface fleet vessels, especially the ballistic missile submarines, usually in concert with a Canadair CP-107 Argus or Lockheed CP-140 Aurora patrol aircraft.

&quot;Onondoga&quot; arrived at HMC Dockyard at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 18 January 1982 in preparation for her SOUP refit. The refit began on 25 June 1983 and was completed on 27 April 1984. Following the SOUP refit and the introduction of the Mark 48 torpedoes, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s were considered fully operational and counted the same as other offensive fleet units in Maritime Command.

Following the end of the Cold War, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s were retasked, performing patrols on behalf of federal institutions such as the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Solicitor General of Canada between 1991 and 1994. For six months in 1994, the submarine served on the west coast. The delay of the introduction of the &quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarines led to the &quot;Oberon&quot;s working past their life expectancy. During the Turbot War, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s were tasked with monitoring European fishing fleets off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Their presence served as a deterrent in the escalating crisis.

&quot;Onondaga&quot; was decommissioned by Maritime Command on 28 July 2000. She was the last &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarine operational in Canadian service. On decommissioning, &quot;Onondaga&quot; and her sister boats were left to await disposal in Halifax harbour.

==Preservation==
In 2001, it was planned to cut &quot;Onondaga&quot; into pieces and reassemble her inside the Canadian War Museum. This plan was cancelled before the end of the year, because of the excessive cost. In May 2005 the &quot;Halifax Chronicle-Herald&quot; announced that Maritime Command was looking to sell &quot;Onondaga&quot; for scrap metal, along with three other Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s. MARCOM stated that the submarines were not in suitable condition to be used as museum ships, and predicted that each submarine would sell for between C$50,000 and C$60,000.

Instead of being scrapped, the submarine was purchased by the Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-Père, Rimouski in 2006, for C$4 plus tax . The submarine was towed from Halifax to Rimouski during the summer of 2008, floated onto a temporary marine railway, then hauled up the shore into the final position. Getting the submarine onto the marine railway required a high tide of , which would only occur during a 2-hour window on 2 August. The removal of torpedoes and batteries following decommissioning had significantly affected &quot;Onondaga&quot;″s displacement, and of water had to be pumped into the ballast tanks before the submarine could be safely towed. Originally due to leave Halifax on 9 July, the tow was delayed by two days due to foul weather. One of the tow bridles snapped before the tugboat and submarine left the harbour, causing a half-day delay. On 12 July, submarine and tugboat were forced to divert via the Canso Canal to avoid Hurricane Bertha; a second tugboat was called in to help &quot;Onondaga&quot; traverse the locks.
&quot;Onondaga&quot; arrived in Rimouski harbour on time for the 2 August high tide, but a heavy storm prevented the operation from occurring. The marine railway was extended further into the water to permit an attempt in September with a tide. The second attempt succeeded in half-removing &quot;Onondaga&quot; from the water, but the submarine was not properly aligned with the support cradles. As the water receded overnight, the submarine rolled to the right and off the railway, puncturing the outer casing on a nearby boulder. A third attempt was made two weeks later, after the submarine was shored up and the cradles were replaced. Two tugboats were used to help position the submarine over the railway, but as the pull from shore started, one of the tugboats applied too much tension and pulled &quot;Onondaga&quot; back off. A fourth and final attempt was made on 28 November; after this, there were no more opportunities before winter struck and froze Rimouski harbour, further damaging the submarine. &quot;Onondaga&quot; was successfully removed clear of the water. The transportation and removal of &quot;Onondaga&quot; from the water was featured in the &#x27;Supersize Submarine&#x27; episode of the &quot;Monster Moves&quot; documentary series.

After repairs and refurbishment, &quot;Onondaga&quot; and her attached museum, as a publicly accessible submarine, opened on 29 May 2009, with over 100,000 visitors in the first year.

<text>Sir Isaac James Hayward (17 November 1884 – 3 January 1976) was a British politician who was the longest-serving leader of the London County Council. He served from 1947 until it was abolished on the expansion of London (to form Greater London) in 1965.

==Biography==

Hayward was the son of a miner from Blaenavon, Monmouthshire, and helped in the mining some years from the age of 12. He became involved in trade union affairs and was chosen as a union official, which brought him to London. From 1932 he was General Secretary of the National Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics and Electrical Workers, retiring in 1946 when his other commitments precluded continuing.

As a trade unionist he also became active in the Labour Party and was selected in 1928 to stand for the party in the London County Council elections in the safe seat of Rotherhithe. Herbert Morrison spotted him and in 1932 appointed him Chief Whip to the Labour Group, a job he retained until he became Leader. Hayward switched to representing Deptford in 1937, and sat until 1955; he served as an Alderman from 1955 until the LCC was abolished in 1965 – a record of 36 years unbroken service which was more than any other member in the LCC&#x27;s history.

When Labour won power in 1934, Morrison appointed Hayward to the crucial job of Chairman of the Public Assistance Committee. His job there was to turn the antiquated Poor law system into a genuine system of welfare, and he instituted more generous programmes of help with rents and fuel, as well as building homes for the elderly that allowed for genuine privacy. Hayward had several other important Chairmanships from 1937.

From 1945 Hayward was given the Education Chair. He was convinced that the future of education lay in comprehensive schools, of which there were none at the time. This was a highly controversial policy and Hayward had to steer it through opposition while restraining the demands of its strongest supporters.
This success, and his skill in managing the party machine, led to his election as Leader in 1947. This LCC leading position had official status since 1933.

The LCC was invited by the Government to build a concert hall in time for the Festival of Britain in 1951. Despite the short timetable Hayward was convinced that it could do it, and the Royal Festival Hall was opened on time. He expanded patronage of the arts and commissioned contemporary works. The Hayward Gallery on the South Bank is named in his honour. He was knighted in 1959. His tenure lasted 23% of the Council&#x27;s lifespan and was almost double that of the two next-nearest in length.

Hayward led the Labour Party&#x27;s opposition to the Herbert Report recommendations that the LCC be abolished and replaced by a Greater London Council, pointing to the work the LCC had done. However, there was a great deal of self-interest involved as the LCC had by this time become merely the inner urban boroughs. These had seen re-housed elsewhere well over one and a half a million residents in a 50-year population downturn (which would then continue another 20 years), had several coal-fired power stations and did not attract the property investment of a 21st-century internationally well-connected London. LCC had a 30-year left-wing majority and when it was more right-wing, for 27 years before, the majority group tended to stand under the brand of Moderate or Municipal Reform. As to the LCC&#x27;s abolition, he and, more directly, those speaking and voting in House of Commons lost the debate and the incoming First Wilson ministry chose not to reject the report and its linked, pending statute. Hayward retired on the forming of the successor council for London which saw devolved more powers and responsibility to boroughs and covered much greater territory.

In elections during his leadership Labour won a firm majority, advancing from 80 seats of 150 (for the three years from 1948) to 102 out of 151 (for the final four years).

When he died in 1974 he lived in Brockley, London SE4 and left very modest wealth, £2513.

<text>In Australian parliamentary practice, the Opposition or the Official Opposition consists of the second largest party or coalition of parties in the Australian House of Representatives, with its leader being given the title &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot;. The Opposition serves the same function as the official opposition in other Commonwealth of Nations monarchies that follow the Westminster conventions and practices. It is seen as the alternative government and the existing administration&#x27;s main opponent in the Australian Parliament and at a general election. By convention, the Opposition Leader in the federal Parliament comes from the House of Representatives, as does the deputy, although the Government and Opposition may also both have leaders in the Senate. The Opposition is sometimes styled as &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot; to show that, although the group may be against the sitting government, it remains loyal to the Crown (the embodiment of the Australian state), and thus to Australia.

The current Opposition at a federal level is the centre-right Liberal Party/National Party Coalition, led by Peter Dutton.

<doc id="579565" wikidata="Q1551781" url="?curid=579565" title="United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194">
<text>The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 is a resolution adopted near the end of the 1947–1949 Palestine war. The Resolution defines principles for reaching a final settlement and returning Palestine refugees to their homes. Article 11 of the resolution resolves that The resolution also calls for the establishment of the United Nations Conciliation Commission to facilitate peace between Israel and Arab states, continuing the efforts of UN Mediator Folke Bernadotte, following his assassination.

Of the 58 members of the United Nations at that time, the resolution was adopted by a majority of 35 countries, with 15 voting against and 8 abstaining. The six Arab League countries then represented at the UN, who were also involved in the war, voted against the resolution. The other significant group which voted against comprised the Communist bloc member countries, all of which had already recognized Israel as a &quot;de jure&quot; state. Israel was not a member of the United Nations at the time, and objected to many of the resolution&#x27;s articles. Palestinian representatives likewise rejected Resolution 194.

The resolution, especially Article 11, was cited in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 302 establishing the UNRWA and other UN resolutions. It has been argued that the resolution enshrines a right of return for the Palestinian refugees, a claim that Israel disputes.

== Background ==
During the 1948 Palestine war, around 700,000 Palestinian Arabs or 85% of the total population fled or were expelled from the territory Israel conquered. The UN Mediator for Palestine, Count Folke Bernadotte, believed that the Palestinians displaced had a right to return to their homes and wrote several UN reports to that effect. On June 28, 1948, during a truce he had arranged, he presented a series of suggestions for a peaceful settlement of the Palestine dispute. One of them was that the UN should recognize &quot;the right of residents of Palestine who, because of conditions created by the conflict there have left their normal places of abode, to return to their homes without restriction and to regain possession of their property.&quot; Another was to incorporate Jerusalem into Arab territory which angered the Israelis. In the report he presented on September 16, he wrote:

In the report, he argued that &quot;[t]he right of Arab refugees to return to their homes in Jewish-controlled territory at the earliest possible date should be affirmed by the United Nations&quot; and that the UN should supervise payment of &quot;adequate compensation for the property&quot; of those choosing not to return. Israel publicly rejected the report, but Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett acknowledged that &quot;[i]t is not so nice or humanitarian to oppose something which is so basic, so simple: a person&#x27;s right to return to the home from which he has been driven out by force.&quot;

While Bernadotte was assassinated by Jewish paramilitaries, his insistence on a right of return for the refugees formed the basis of resolution 194.

== Views ==
Several organizations and individuals believe that resolution 194 enshrines a right for the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes in territory that Israel occupied in the 1948 war. The UN General Assembly has reaffirmed Resolution 194 every year since 1949 and other UN resolutions have reaffirmed the right of return, including General Assembly Resolution 169 in 1980.

Joshua Muravchik does not believe that resolution 194 enshrines a right of return, pointing out that the text states that the refugees &quot;should be permitted&quot; to return to their homes at the &quot;earliest practicable date&quot; and this recommendation applies only to those &quot;wishing to... live at peace with their neighbors&quot;.

=== Palestinian and Arab views ===
The Arab states originally voted against resolution 194, but they began to reverse their position by spring 1949 and soon became its strongest advocates. The 2002 Arab Peace Initiative softened their stance by calling for &quot;a just solution which must also be accepted by Israel.&quot;

Palestinian representatives initially rejected resolution 194 because they viewed it as being based on the illegality of the state of Israel. By their reasoning, Israel had no right to prevent the return of the &quot;indigenous Arab people of Palestine&quot;. Later, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and other Palestinian organizations has come to view resolution 194 as one source of legal authority for the right of return. In an address in 2009, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stated:
Abbas has on other several occasions referred to a &quot;just solution&quot; to the Palestinian refugees &quot;on the basis of Resolution 194&quot;. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the PLO Executive Committee has similarly declared that resolution 194 enshrines a non-negotiable right of return:
The Palestinian-led BDS movement asserts that Israel must comply with international law by, among other things, &quot;[r]especting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.&quot;

=== Israeli view ===

Israel does not believe that it has an obligation to let the refugees return, a view was promulgated by the Israeli leadership even before resolution 194 was adopted. In a cabinet meeting in June 1948 Israel&#x27;s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion stated: &quot;They [the Palestinians] lost and fled. Their return must now be prevented... And I will oppose their return also after the war.&quot; Ben-Gurion&#x27;s words were echoed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir who in 1992 declared that the return of the Palestinian refugees &quot;will never happen in any way, shape or form. There is only a Jewish right of return to the land of Israel.&quot;

Israel also argued that it did not have to compensate refugees for land and property that they had abandoned. In a press conference in 1949, Sharett stated:
In the debates about UN resolution 273 in May 1949, about Israel&#x27;s admittance to the UN, Israel&#x27;s UN representative Abba Eban promised that the state would honor its obligations under resolution 181 and resolution 194. El Salvador&#x27;s representative asked:

Eban replied:

Israel was thus admitted to the United Nations in May 1949 on condition that it &quot;unreservedly accepts the obligations of the UN Charter and undertakes to honour them from the day when it becomes a member of the UN.&quot; But Israel didn&#x27;t comply with the right of return as reaffirmed in resolution 194.

Israel has offered to repatriate a number of refugees as part of negotiations: see the Lausanne Conference (April-September 1949), the 2000 Camp David negotiations, and Israeli–Palestinian peace process, §Camp David 2000 Summit, Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Parameters,&quot; and the Taba talks.

=== Polling ===
The Palestinian people have demonstrated strong support for a right of return based on resolution 194. In a 1999 poll by Elia Zureik, some 61.4% of the Palestinians in Israel said that a proper solution to the refugee issue should be based on resolution 194 and about half found such a solution feasible; in the occupied Palestinian territories, over 80% of the Palestinians considered resolution 194 to be a just solution to the refugee problem, and about 50% thought implementing 194 was feasible. In contrast, fewer than 5% of Jewish Israeli respondents thought resolution 194 was either just or feasible.

== Voting results ==
The result of the voting was the following:

In Favor
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, Liberia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela.

UN Resolution 3236 &amp; 3237 adopted in 1974, and UN Resolution 3379 adopted in 1975 which determined that Palestine have international representation for self-determination, UN Assembly observer status, and that the Palestinian people seek redress having been subjected to racial discrimination respectively.

<doc id="579568" wikidata="Q466861" url="?curid=579568" title="Sandra White">
<text>Sandra White (born 17 August 1951) is a retired Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow electoral region from 1999 until 2011, and then the MSP for the Glasgow Kelvin constituency from 2011 until she stood down from the Scottish Parliament at the May 2021 election.

==Political career==

White served as an SNP councillor in Renfrewshire. She contested Glasgow Kelvin in 1999, where she came second to the Labour Party candidate by 4,408 votes, but was elected to the Scottish Parliament on the Glasgow regional list. She served as an SNP parliamentary group whip in the first parliamentary session. Contesting Glasgow Kelvin in 2003, she came second to Labour by a smaller margin of 3,289 votes. She was re-elected on the regional list, topping the SNP&#x27;s list of candidates for the Glasgow region, and was given her party&#x27;s Deputy Social Justice portfolio.

White&#x27;s campaigns included against closures and downgrading the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill and the Queen Mother&#x27;s Hospital. She has also campaigned against racism and for improved treatment of asylum seekers, including joining an occupation against dawn raids. Her other campaigns included the successful attempts to save the 7:84 theatre group from threatened loss of funding by the Scottish Arts Council and involvement in Stop the War Coalition events, while high-profile constituency work has included the August 2006 case of an 86-year-old widow who was threatened with court by Glasgow Housing Association.

White was re-elected on the regional list in 2007 and, in the 2011 election, she again contested the Glasgow Kelvin seat, this time defeating the sitting Labour MSP Pauline McNeill by 882 votes. She sat as deputy convener of the Public Petitions Committee and Equal Opportunities Committee.

In November 2015 White retweeted an antisemitic cartoon showing piglets suckling a large pig with the word “Rothschild” written on it and showing a bank with a Star of David. The tweet had originally been sent by a Twitter user who had repeatedly posted antisemitic messages and images. After &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; brought the tweet to the attention of the SNP, the party&#x27;s spokesperson said the tweet had been re-tweeted in error, and had since been deleted.

In August 2020, White announced that she would not be standing for re-election at the upcoming Holyrood election.

== Personal life ==
White was born on 17 August 1951 to Elizabeth Rodgers and Henry Harley. She married David White in 1971, and has two sons and one daughter. Her interests outside politics are walking, reading and gardening.

<doc id="579570" wikidata="Q467112" url="?curid=579570" title="Nicola Sturgeon">
<text>Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon (born 19 July 1970) is a Scottish politician who served as First Minister of Scotland and Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 2014 to 2023. She has served as a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 1999, first as an additional member for the Glasgow electoral region, and as the member for Glasgow Southside (formerly Glasgow Govan) from 2007.

Born in Ayrshire, Sturgeon is a law graduate of the University of Glasgow. She worked as a solicitor in Glasgow before her election to the Scottish Parliament in 1999. She served successively as the SNP&#x27;s shadow minister for education, health, and justice. Sturgeon entered the leadership of the SNP but later withdrew from the contest in favour of Alex Salmond, standing instead as leader on a joint ticket with Salmond. Both were subsequently elected; as Salmond was still an MP, Sturgeon led the SNP in the Scottish Parliament as Leader of the Opposition from 2004 to 2007. The SNP emerged as the largest party following the 2007 election and Salmond headed the first SNP minority government, with Sturgeon as his deputy. From 2007 to 2012, she served as health secretary, overseeing the scrapping of prescription charges and the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Following the SNP&#x27;s landslide majority in 2011, she was appointed Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Capital Investment and Cities, which saw her in charge of the legislative process for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign resulted in Salmond&#x27;s resignation as SNP leader.

Sturgeon was elected unopposed as SNP leader in November 2014 and was subsequently appointed as first minister, becoming the first woman to hold either position. She entered office amid a rapid surge in membership of the SNP, which was reflected in the party&#x27;s performance in the 2015 general election, winning 56 of the 59 Scottish seats and replacing the Liberal Democrats as the third-largest party in the House of Commons. The SNP continued to enjoy electoral successes throughout Sturgeon&#x27;s nine years in office, but lost 21 seats in the 2017 general election. Despite losing her majority, Sturgeon secured a second term in office in 2016, forming a minority government.

Sturgeon led the Scottish Government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a series of restrictions on social gatherings and the rollout of the vaccine programme. A seat short of a majority in 2021, Sturgeon became the only first minister to serve a third term, and she subsequently entered a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. The calls from Sturgeon&#x27;s government and the wider independence movement for a second referendum were unsuccessful, as successive Conservative prime ministers refused to grant a Section 30 order. From 2022, Sturgeon received heavier criticism for her positions on gender reforms. On 15 February 2023, Sturgeon resigned the leadership of the SNP claiming occupational burnout; she was succeeded by her health secretary, Humza Yousaf, the following month.

== Early life and education ==
Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon was born in Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine on 19 July 1970. She is the eldest of two daughters born to Joan Kerr Sturgeon (&quot;née&quot; Ferguson, born 23 October 1952), a dental nurse, and Robin Sturgeon (born 28 September 1948), an electrician. Her younger sister, Gillian Sturgeon, is an NHS worker. Her family has some roots in North East England; her paternal grandmother, Margaret Sturgeon (&quot;née&quot; Mill), was from Ryhope in what is now the City of Sunderland. Her grandmother married Robert Sturgeon, a gardener from Ayr, at St Paul&#x27;s Parish Church in 1943, and they both eventually moved back to the south west of Scotland. Sturgeon grew up in Prestwick and in the village of Dreghorn, in a terraced council house, which her parents bought through the right-to-buy scheme.

Sturgeon was a quiet child and has been described by her younger sister as &quot;the sensible one&quot; of the two. Sturgeon was shy and has said that she &quot;much preferred to sit with my head in a book than talking to people&quot;. She developed a passion for books and reading which continued into adult life. She has described herself as being an &quot;austere&quot; teen whose style tended towards goth, adding that &quot;if you see pictures of me back then, you would struggle to know whether I was a boy or a girl&quot;. Sturgeon was a fan of Wham! and Duran Duran, and enjoyed spending Saturday nights at Frosty&#x27;s Ice Disco in Irvine.

Sturgeon attended Dreghorn Primary School from 1975 to 1982 and Greenwood Academy from 1982 to 1988. She later studied law at the University of Glasgow School of Law, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws (Hons) in 1992 and a Diploma in Legal Practice the following year. During her time at the University of Glasgow she was active as a member of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association and the Glasgow University Students&#x27; Representative Council.

== Legal career ==
Following her graduation, Sturgeon completed her legal traineeship at McClure Naismith, a Glasgow firm of solicitors, in 1995. After qualifying as a solicitor, she worked for Bell &amp; Craig, a firm of solicitors in Stirling, and later at the Drumchapel Law Centre and a Money Advice Centre in Glasgow from 1997 until her election to the Scottish Parliament in 1999.

== Early parliamentary career ==

===Early political years===

In her early teens, Sturgeon joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and in 1986, at the age of 16, she became a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), quickly becoming the party&#x27;s Youth Affairs Vice Convener and Publicity Vice Convener. She joined the SNP following an assumption by her English teacher, who was a Labour councillor, she would be a Labour supporter. In the 1987 UK General election, Sturgeon got her first taste of campaigning, going door-to-door to get her local SNP candidate, Kay Ullrich, elected to Westminster. Despite Ullrich failing to win the seat, Sturgeon ploughed her political energy into the Young Scottish Nationalists (now Young Scots for Independence), joining its national executive when she was 17.

In an interview with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, Sturgeon revealed that it was Margaret Thatcher who inspired her to enter politics, because, due to rising unemployment in Scotland at the time, she developed &quot;a strong feeling that it was wrong for Scotland to be governed by a Tory government that we hadn&#x27;t elected&quot;.

Sturgeon became the youngest ever parliamentary candidate in Scotland in the 1992 general election. Aged 21, Sturgeon was selected as the SNP candidate in the Glasgow Shettleston constituency. She was unsuccessful, having been beaten by almost 15,000 votes by Labour. Sturgeon also stood unsuccessfully as the SNP candidate for the Irvine North ward on Cunninghame District Council in May 1992, for the Baillieston/Mount Vernon ward on Strathclyde Regional Council in 1994, and for the Bridgeton ward on Glasgow City Council in 1995.

In the mid-1990s Sturgeon and Charles Kennedy went together on a political study visit to Australia.

The 1997 general election saw Sturgeon selected to fight the Glasgow Govan seat for the SNP. Boundary changes meant that the notional Labour majority in the seat had increased substantially. However, infighting between the two rival candidates for the Labour nomination, Mohammed Sarwar and Mike Watson, along with an energetic local campaign, resulted in Glasgow Govan being the only Scottish seat to see a swing away from Labour in the midst of a Labour landslide nationwide. Sarwar did, however, win the seat with a majority of 2,914 votes. Shortly after this, Sturgeon was appointed as the SNP&#x27;s spokesperson for energy and education matters.

=== SNP in opposition ===

Sturgeon stood for election to the Scottish Parliament in the first Scottish Parliament election in 1999 as the SNP candidate for Glasgow Govan. Although she failed to win the seat, she was placed first in the SNP&#x27;s regional list for the Glasgow region, and was thus elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament. The SNP emerged as the second largest party and sat in opposition to the Labour-Lib Dem coalition. In Alex Salmond&#x27;s shadow cabinet, she served as Shadow Minister for Children and Education from 1999 to 2000.

As Shadow Education minister, Sturgeon backed Labour&#x27;s efforts to repeal Section 28 – a Westminster law that banned the promotion of homosexuality in schools. There was, however, significant public opposition to repeal and an unscientific postal vote on the issue – organised by SNP donor Brian Souter – suggested most Scots wanted to keep the clause. Acknowledging this, Sturgeon suggested: &quot;That is why the SNP have urged a policy for many months that we believe can provide people with the necessary reassurance, by providing a statutory underpinning to the guidelines, and resolve this difficult debate. We believe that the value of marriage should be clearly referred to in the guidelines, without denigrating other relationships or children brought up in other kinds of relationship.&quot; The compromise had the support of Souter but an amendment to that effect was voted down by MSPs who expressed concerns it would stigmatise children from single parent and unmarried families.

Sturgeon served as Shadow Minister for Health and Community Care from 2000 to 2003, and Shadow Minister for Justice from 2003 to 2004. She also served as a member of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee and the Health and Community Care Committee.

=== 2004 SNP leadership election ===
On 22 June 2004, John Swinney resigned as Leader of the SNP following poor results in the European Parliament election. His then-depute, Roseanna Cunningham, immediately stood for the leadership. The previous leader, Alex Salmond, at the time refused to stand. On 24 June 2004, Sturgeon also entered the leadership contest, with Kenny MacAskill as her running mate. The political columnist Iain Macwhirter declared that while she &quot;didn&#x27;t inspire great warmth&quot;, she was &quot;quick on her feet, lacks any ideological baggage and has real determination – unlike... Roseanna Cunningham&quot;.

However, once Cunningham emerged as the favourite to win, Salmond entered the contest and Sturgeon subsequently withdrew from the contest and declared her support for Salmond, standing instead as his running mate for the depute leadership. It was reported that Salmond had privately supported Sturgeon in her leadership bid, but decided to run for the position himself as it became apparent she was unlikely to beat Cunningham. The majority of the SNP hierarchy lent their support to the Salmond–Sturgeon bid for the leadership, although MSP Alex Neil backed Salmond as leader, but refused to endorse Sturgeon as depute.

On 3 September 2004, the leadership contest resulted in Salmond and Sturgeon elected as Leader and Depute Leader respectively. As Salmond was still an MP in the House of Commons, Sturgeon led the SNP at the Scottish Parliament until the 2007 election, when Salmond was elected as an MSP.

=== Leader of the Opposition; 2004–2007 ===
As leader of the SNP in the Scottish Parliament, she served as the Leader of the Opposition in Holyrood. Sturgeon became a high-profile figure in Scottish politics and often clashed with First Minister Jack McConnell at First Minister&#x27;s Questions. This included rows over the House of Commons&#x27; decision to replace the Trident nuclear weapon system, and the SNP&#x27;s plans to replace council tax in Scotland with a local income tax. Sturgeon quickly grew a reputation in Holyrood as opposition leader, becoming known as &quot;nippy sweetie&quot; – Scottish slang for the &quot;sharp-tongued and strong-minded&quot;.

== Deputy First Minister of Scotland (2007–2014) ==
In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Sturgeon defeated Gordon Jackson QC with a 4.7% swing to the SNP in the Glasgow Govan constituency. This was one of many swings to the SNP, as the party emerged as the largest party, winning one seat more than the governing Scottish Labour Party. Although the SNP was recognised as the winners of the election, it failed to obtain a majority and Labour was not willing to allow the SNP to enter government. Sturgeon led coalition negotiation talks between the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens, but these talks failed to reach an agreement, with the Lib Dems backing out and the Greens instead supporting a &#x27;confidence and supply&#x27; agreement. Ultimately, Salmond formed a minority government and he was appointed First Minister of Scotland. He appointed Sturgeon as Deputy First Minister and tasked her with the Cabinet position of Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing.

=== Health Secretary (2007–2012) ===

Sturgeon served as Health Secretary in Salmond&#x27;s first, and for a year, in his second cabinet. She was supported in her role as Health Secretary by Shona Robison, the Minister for Public Health and Sport, and by Alex Neil, the Minister for Housing and Communities. She launched her programme for government, the &quot;Better Health, Better Care: Action Plan,&quot; which settled a new vision for NHS Scotland. She reversed the decision to close casualty units at University Hospital Ayr and University Hospital Monklands. Sturgeon oversaw the scrapping of prescription charges In Scotland, an election pledge by the SNP originally for the chronically ill and those with cancer.

==== Health policy ====
Sturgeon also outlined a guaranteed maximum 18-week wait for patients after they had seen their GP and vowed to do away with deferred or &quot;hidden&quot; waiting lists. She ordered a review of the issue of hospital car parking charges – as high as £7 in some areas – and launched an inquiry into the infection of NHS patients with Hepatitis C and HIV from tainted blood products.

==== 2009 swine flu pandemic ====

As Health Secretary, Sturgeon became more widely known internationally for her handling of the 2009 flu pandemic.

On 26 April 2009, the Scottish Government confirmed that two people who had returned from Mexico had been admitted to Monklands Hospital in Airdrie after experiencing &quot;mild flu-like symptoms&quot;. Sturgeon stated that there was &quot;no immediate threat to public health in Scotland&quot;, but added, &quot;monitoring of those who have been in close contact with the two people is also being carried out as an additional precaution.&quot; The following day, she confirmed that these were cases of the swine influenza A (H1N1) virus. Authorities in both Scotland and England stated that there were no plans to trace the fellow airline passengers who may have travelled alongside the couple, since the authorities do not classify them as &quot;close contacts&quot;.

On 11 June, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the influenza virus a pandemic. Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that containment of the virus had failed and that the Scottish Government was taking steps to mitigate the spread of the virus. &quot;We have seen a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Scotland over the past 10 days&quot;, she told Parliament. &quot;Based on this experience, Health Protection Scotland has expressed the view that sustained community transmission appears to be taking place.&quot; Four days later, a Scottish woman with underlying health conditions died at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. This marked the first death in Scotland and Europe.

==== Minimum pricing unit ====
To tackle Scotland&#x27;s poor relationship with alcohol, Sturgeon passed legislation to increase the price of alcohol per unit to help reduce sales, in particular, for those addicted. In June 2012, the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012 was passed after receiving support from the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and Greens. Labour refused to support the bill as they claimed it failed to tackle windfall profit from alcohol retailers.

=== Infrastructure Secretary (2012–2014) ===
At the 2011 election, the SNP won a large overall majority. Sturgeon was retained as Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing until a reshuffle one year later, when she was appointed as Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Capital Investment and Cities and an additional role overseeing the referendum on Scottish independence, essentially putting her in charge of the SNP&#x27;s referendum campaign.

In 2012 she pledged to build a high-speed railway line between Glasgow and Edinburgh by 2024, cutting journey times between the two cities to under 30 minutes. Sturgeon said the Scottish Government would &quot;not wait&quot; for Westminster to build a high-speed line to Scotland. However, in 2016 the plan was abandoned and the Scottish Government blamed Westminster.

=== 2014 Scottish independence referendum ===

Salmond put Sturgeon in charge of the Scottish Government&#x27;s legislative process for a referendum on Scottish Independence and she was essentially in charge of the SNP&#x27;s referendum campaign.

In December 2012, Sturgeon said that she believed that independence would allow Scotland to build a stronger and more competitive country, and would change spending priorities to address &quot;the scandal of soaring poverty in a country as rich as Scotland&quot;.

While campaigning for a Yes vote in August 2013, she told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that if Scots voted for the Union: &quot;Will there be another referendum round the corner? No. We can&#x27;t bind our successors, but we&#x27;ve made very clear our belief that constitutional referenda are once-in-a-generation events.&quot;

In November 2013, Sturgeon joined Salmond to launch Scotland&#x27;s Future – the Scottish Government&#x27;s prospectus for independence. Sturgeon was one of the white paper&#x27;s most high-profile media champions and frequently debated its contents with opposition politicians and sceptical Scots. When the British Government turned down the Scottish Government&#x27;s idea of a formal currency union – on the grounds that the rationale for sharing a currency with a foreign country was &quot;not clear&quot; – Sturgeon accused Westminster of trying to &quot;bully Scotland&quot; and said it would &quot;cost their own businesses hundreds of millions in transaction costs&quot;.

During the campaign, the European Commission said that if Scots decided to leave the United Kingdom, it would also mean leaving the European Union. Scotland would then have to reapply for EU membership and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso predicted this would be &quot;extremely difficult, if not impossible&quot;. In July 2014 Sturgeon said this would put at risk the right of EU citizens to continue living in Scotland: &quot;There are 160,000 EU nationals from other states living in Scotland, including some in the Commonwealth Games city of Glasgow. If Scotland was outside Europe, they would lose the right to stay here.&quot;

On 19 September 2014, independence was rejected in the Scottish independence referendum, with 55.3% of the voters voting no and 44.7% voting yes. Following the defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign, Salmond resigned as First Minister and Leader of the SNP. Sturgeon immediately entered the election to replace him, and received huge support from the SNP hierarchy. Sturgeon said that there would be &quot;no greater privilege&quot; than to lead the SNP. On Salmond&#x27;s resignation, Sturgeon said:
The personal debt of gratitude I owe Alex is immeasurable. He has been my friend, mentor and colleague for more than 20 years. Quite simply, I would not have been able to do what I have in politics without his constant advice, guidance and support through all these years. [...] I can think of no greater privilege than to seek to lead the party I joined when I was just 16. However, that decision is not for today.

Following the referendum defeat, Sturgeon said that &quot;further devolution is the route to independence&quot;. She also opined that Scottish independence was a matter of &quot;when, not if&quot;.

===Leadership of the Scottish National Party===

On 24 September 2014, Sturgeon officially launched her campaign bid to succeed Salmond as Leader of the Scottish National Party at the November leadership election. It quickly became apparent that no other candidate would be able to receive enough required nominations to run a credible leadership campaign. Upon launching her campaign, Sturgeon also resigned as Depute Leader, triggering a concurrent depute leadership election; the MSPs Angela Constance and Keith Brown and the MP Stewart Hosie all nominated themselves to succeed Sturgeon as Depute Leader.

Nominations for the SNP leadership closed on 15 October, with Sturgeon confirmed as the only candidate. SNP convener Derek Mackay publicly congratulated Sturgeon as de facto leader in waiting, saying that she would be &quot;a fantastic new leader&quot; for both the SNP and for Scotland. On this date, Sturgeon also came out on top in a trust rating opinion poll, conducted for the SNP, which indicated that 54% of the Scottish population trusted her to &quot;stand up for Scotland&#x27;s interests&quot;.

At a speech in Dundee&#x27;s Caird Hall on 7 November, Sturgeon pledged to be &quot;the most accessible First Minister ever&quot; when she took over. She also promised to hold a monthly Facebook question and answer session with members of the public, regular town hall meetings and that the Scottish Cabinet would meet outside Edinburgh once every two months.

Sturgeon was formally acclaimed as the first female Leader of the SNP on 14 November 2014 at the Autumn Conference in Perth, with Hosie as her depute. This also made her First Minister-Designate, given the SNP&#x27;s absolute majority in the Scottish Parliament. In her first speech as leader, Sturgeon said that it was &quot;the privilege of her life&quot; to lead the party she joined as a teenager.

Although Salmond officially tendered his resignation as First Minister on 18 November 2014, Sturgeon was not sworn in until two days later. From 18 November until her official appointment on 20 November, she served as the acting First Minister, essentially the First Minister-elect.

== First Minister of Scotland (2014–2023) ==
===First term (2014–2016)===
On 20 November 2014, Sturgeon was sworn into office at the Court of Session in a ceremony presided by Lord Gill, after receiving the royal warrant of appointment by Queen Elizabeth II. She became the first woman to hold office. During her first First Minister&#x27;s Questions after being sworn in, Sturgeon tried to strike a conciliatory tone, saying that she came into her new post &quot;with an open mind and a willingness to hear proposals from all sides of the chamber.&quot;

==== First cabinet ====
Sturgeon began making appointments to her first cabinet on 21 November 2014, beginning with the appointment of finance secretary John Swinney to become her Deputy First Minister. Shona Robison, a close ally to Sturgeon, became the health secretary, while Keith Brown and Angela Constance, who were both unsuccessful in their bids for the deputy leadership of the SNP, were appointed infrastructure secretary and education secretary, respectively. Michael Matheson was promoted as justice secretary.

The departure of Kenny MacAskill and Michael Russell signalled a generational shift away from the &quot;79 group&quot;. Alex Neil, who many speculated would be dismissed, remained in cabinet but in a &quot;less prominent portfolio&quot; of social justice, communities and pensioners&#x27; rights. Roseanna Cunningham, who had difficult relationship with Sturgeon, was surprisingly promoted to cabinet as the fair work secretary. Fiona Hyslop and Richard Lochhead remained in their portfolios of culture secretary and rural affairs secretary, respectively.

Sturgeon&#x27;s cabinet was 50/50 gender balance, with five men and five women, including herself.

==== 2015 Westminster landslide ====

Sturgeon led the Scottish National Party through a landslide victory in the 2015 UK general election, winning 56 out of 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, the party&#x27;s best ever performance. The party received 50% of the vote share in Scotland and replaced the Liberal Democrats as the third largest party in the British House of Commons. Sturgeon had stated that the party&#x27;s success in the election was not a mandate for another independence referendum, but primarily for a stronger voice for Scotland in London.

In the run-up to the elections, Sturgeon took part in several Scottish and UK-wide TV election debates and according to opinion polls was regarded to have had a successful performance. As part of the election campaign, Sturgeon indicated that the SNP would hold another independence referendum if it won the upcoming 2016 Scottish Parliament election.

==== 2016 Scottish Parliament election ====
Sturgeon launched, in what she claimed, as the most &quot;bold, ambitious and reforming&quot; SNP manifesto for the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. She set out the party&#x27;s plans to increase income tax by freezing tax thresholds, reversing her previous policy of cutting taxes for higher earners. The manifesto also included a commitment to increase NHS funding by £500 million, &quot;baby boxes&quot; full of essentials to newborn parents, and an ambitious new target to cut emissions by 50% by 2020 as of the party&#x27;s effort to tackle climate change. Sturgeon also hinted if re-elected she would hold a second referendum on Scottish independence.

Despite losing her majority, Sturgeon claimed a &quot;historic victory&quot; after the SNP won a third consecutive term in government and sought a second term in office as a minority government.
===Second term (2016–2021)===
==== 2016 EU membership referendum ====
In 2016, the European Union membership referendum to decide the future of the UK&#x27;s European Union membership resulted in 52% of voters in the UK voting for Brexit (leaving the EU), with 48% voting to remain; all council areas in Scotland voted by a majority for the UK to remain a member of the EU. Across Scotland, 62% of voters backed the UK remaining a member of the EU, with 38% voting for the UK to leave.

In response to the result, on 24 June 2016, Sturgeon said that Scottish Government officials would begin planning for a second independence referendum. Sturgeon claimed that it was &quot;clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union&quot; and that Scotland had &quot;spoken decisively&quot; with a &quot;strong, unequivocal&quot; vote to remain in the European Union. Sturgeon said it was &quot;democratically unacceptable&quot; that Scotland could be taken out of the EU &quot;against its will&quot;. An emergency Scottish cabinet meeting on 25 June agreed that the Scottish Government would seek to enter negotiations with the EU and its member states, to explore options to protect Scotland&#x27;s place in the EU. Sturgeon later said that while she believed in Scottish independence, her starting point in these discussions was to protect Scotland&#x27;s relationship with the EU.

==== Future referendum on independence ====
Sturgeon confirmed in June 2016 that the Scottish government had formally agreed to draft legislation to allow a second independence referendum to take place. As the constitution is a reserved matter under the Scotland Act 1998, for a future referendum on Scottish independence to be legal under UK law, it would need to receive the consent of the British Parliament to take place.

Prior to the day the Prime Minister triggered Article 50, formally allowing the process of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Scottish Parliament voted 69 to 59 in favour of another independence referendum. By the end of that week, on 30 March 2017, Sturgeon wrote to the Prime Minister requesting a Section 30 order, formally devolving the responsibility and power to the Scottish Government to plan for and hold another referendum on Scottish independence. Previously, May and David Mundell, Secretary of State for Scotland, had both highlighted that as the negotiations began with the European Union on the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdraw, it was important for Scotland to work with the UK Government to get the best exit deal for both the United Kingdom and Scotland, stating that &quot;now is not the time for another referendum&quot;.

Following the 2017 UK general election, Sturgeon&#x27;s government postponed legislation pertaining to the proposed second referendum on Scottish independence until at least autumn 2018. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, all plans for another referendum were put on hold.

==== 2017 UK general election ====

Sturgeon kicked off her election campaign pledging that a strong result for the SNP would &quot;reinforce&quot; her mandate for a second independence referendum. However, the SNP lost 21 seats in the 2017 United Kingdom general election in Scotland and the party&#x27;s vote dropped by 13%, although they remained the biggest party in Scotland. Sturgeon admitted that these results were &quot;bitterly disappointing&quot; and acknowledged that her party&#x27;s plans for a second referendum were &#x27;undoubtedly&#x27; a factor in the election results. It was the best result for the Scottish Conservatives since Margaret Thatcher and the party&#x27;s campaign slogan, &quot;We said No to independence. We meant it&quot;, resonated in areas that had voted strongly for the Union in 2014. Observers also concluded that opposition to the EU&#x27;s Common Fisheries Policy in coastal communities was a factor behind large swings to the Tories in North East seats previously held by nationalists for decades.

Several weeks later Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that she would &quot;reset&quot; and delay her plans for a second independence referendum; the SNP losses in that month&#x27;s election had led her to conclude that many Scots &quot;just want a break from making big political decisions&quot;.

==== Alex Salmond sexual harassment case ====


In January 2019, Sturgeon referred herself to an independent ministerial ethics body, which led to an investigation into her actions with respect to a sexual harassment case concerning allegations against Salmond. This followed her admitting that she had had a secret meeting and subsequent phone call with Salmond about the Scottish government&#x27;s allegations against him. She raised these with the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government, Leslie Evans, two months later, rather than reporting them immediately, as she should have done if they constitute government matters (as per the ministerial code). Sturgeon argued that the meetings were SNP party matters, and thus not covered. The investigating panel consisted of Dame Elish Angiolini, a former Solicitor General for Scotland and lord advocate, and James Hamilton, a former director of public prosecutions in the Republic of Ireland.

On 15 January 2019, the Scottish Parliament agreed to hold its own inquiry into the matter, the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints, to investigate how the Government breached its own guidelines in its original investigation into the harassment claims against Salmond, and then lost a judicial review into their actions and had to pay over £500,000 to Salmond for legal expenses. Sturgeon&#x27;s husband, Peter Murrell, was called to this inquiry to give evidence on 8 December 2020. Opposition parties criticised Sturgeon on disparity and contradictions between the narratives of Murrell and herself.

On 4 March 2021, Sturgeon answered questions over a period of eight hours from members of the committee. Two of the civil servants who made complaints about Salmond later said they felt they had been &quot;dropped&quot; by the Scottish Government after it lost the judicial review against him, adding they feared their experiences would make it less likely people would make complaints in the future. Labour MP Jess Phillips, a former employee of Women&#x27;s Aid, accused Sturgeon of being &quot;unprofessional with those women&#x27;s lives&quot; and said there had been a &quot;litany of failures in professionalism and decency.&quot;

==== 2019 UK general election ====

Sturgeon led her party to a landslide victory in the 2019 United Kingdom general election in Scotland. The SNP won 48 seats, and came second place in the 11 others; their 45% of the vote yielded 80% of the seats in Scotland. Among the election casualties was Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in East Dunbartonshire. Sturgeon was branded as &quot;ungracious&quot; when she was filmed by Sky News celebrating Swinson&#x27;s defeat. Sturgeon apologised for being overexcited although expressed that she was celebrating Amy Callaghan&#x27;s win. In the wake of the results, Sturgeon said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had &quot;no right&quot; to stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum after an &quot;overwhelming&quot; SNP election victory. She also said that the result &quot;renews, reinforces and strengthens&quot; the mandate for Indyref2.

====COVID-19 pandemic====

The worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 began during Sturgeon&#x27;s second term as First Minister. The first case of the virus in Scotland was confirmed on 1 March 2020, when a resident in Tayside had tested positive.

Initially, the Scottish Government resisted banning public events and on 12 March allowed 47,000 fans to attend a Rangers match at Ibrox, insisting that, &quot;stopping mass gatherings [is] not the best way to contain this virus.&quot; However, Sturgeon&#x27;s government ordered all schools and nurseries in Scotland closed on 20 March to try to limit the spread of the virus. On 23 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Sturgeon ordered Scotland into &quot;lockdown&quot;, limiting the reasons why people may leave their homes in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, to protect the health of the population, and to ease the pressure the virus placed on NHS Scotland services and workforce. Subsequently the restrictions were repeatedly tightened, loosened and adapted in parts or all of Scotland in response to developments in the situation.

During the early stages of the pandemic, 1,300 elderly hospital patients were transferred into care homes without receiving a negative coronavirus test result. Many had been infected with the virus and ended up passing it on to other care home residents. Over three thousand care home residents died from COVID-19 and Gary Smith, Scotland Secretary of the GMB, said the policy had turned &quot;care homes into morgues&quot;. When asked by the BBC if the policy had been a mistake, Sturgeon said: &quot;Looking back on that now, with the knowledge we have now and with the benefit of hindsight, yes.&quot; In April 2020 whistle-blowers in the NHS came forward to reveal that staff were being made to reuse dirty personal protective equipment (PPE) while at work. One nurse told STV, &quot;[When we hear the government say supplies are fine] it&#x27;s not frustrating, it&#x27;s crushing. It is absolutely crushing. We feel we are being lied to.&quot; Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament in July, &quot;At no point within this crisis has Scotland run out of any aspect of PPE. We have worked hard to make sure that supplies are there, we&#x27;ve worked hard overcoming challenges that we have faced along the way.&quot;

In July 2020, Sturgeon advocated that the leaders of the four UK nations adopt a coordinated Zero-COVID strategy.

In February 2021, Audit Scotland published a report that concluded the Scottish government had not prepared adequately for a pandemic. While it commended the authorities for preventing hospitals from becoming overwhelmed during the crisis, the watchdog also noted that recommendations from pandemic planning exercises in 2015, 2016 and 2018 had not been fully implemented. One particular problem it highlighted was that not enough had been done to ensure Scottish hospitals and care homes had enough personal protective equipment. Overall, it concluded that ministers &quot;could have been better prepared to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic&quot;. Sturgeon said there were &quot;lots of lessons to learn&quot;.

In March 2021, the Court of Session declared that the Scottish government&#x27;s prohibition on communal worship, imposed during the pandemic, was unlawful. This followed an open letter two months earlier, written by 200 church leaders to Sturgeon, warning her that the prohibition could be unlawful.

In April 2021, Scotland&#x27;s death toll from COVID-19 passed 10,000.

At a session of First Minister&#x27;s Questions in June 2021, Sturgeon was asked about mistakes made early on in the pandemic, and she replied: &quot;If I could turn the clock back, would we go into lockdown earlier than we did? Yes, I think that is true.&quot;

In April 2022, Sturgeon demanded that Prime Minister Boris Johnson resign after police fined him for breaking lockdown rules in 2020. &quot;The basic values of integrity and decency – essential to the proper working of any parliamentary democracy – demand that he go&quot;, she tweeted. The following week, Sturgeon received an official reprimand from Police Scotland after a video emerged of her campaigning in a barber shop without a mask. Sturgeon – who had previously apologised to the Scottish Parliament after she was caught breaking the same law in December 2020 – apologised once more and said the police had been &quot;absolutely right to treat me no differently to any other citizen.&quot;

===Third term (2021–23)===
Sturgeon led the SNP into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election on a manifesto promise to hold a second independence referendum after the COVID-19 pandemic was over. In the election, the SNP won 64 of the 129 seats contested. The SNP won a fourth consecutive election, albeit short of an overall majority, with a record number of votes on both the constituency and regional vote as well as increasing their share of the constituency vote and making a net gain of one seat.

Sturgeon was nominated for the post of First Minister by a vote of the Scottish Parliament on 18 May, defeating Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie by 64 votes to 31 and 4 respectively. This win resulted in Sturgeon becoming the first First Minister in the history of the Scottish Parliament to form a third government. Shortly after being elected, Sturgeon appointed John Swinney to the newly created position of Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery.

==== Power-sharing agreement ====

In August 2021, Sturgeon and Scottish Green Party co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater reached a power-sharing agreement between their parties. There was no agreement on oil and gas exploration, but the government now argued that it had a stronger case for a national independence referendum. As part of the agreement, the Green Party co-leaders would be nominated to serve as ministers.
==== Climate crisis ====
In August 2021, confronted by climate activist Lauren Macdonald about the Cambo oil field west of Shetland, Sturgeon refused to take a position on whether its development should go ahead. A video of the interaction went viral and a few days later, Sturgeon wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, asking that the development of Cambo should be &quot;reassessed in light of the severity of the climate emergency&quot;. The letter represented a significant shift in policy for the SNP, which had historically been a strong supporter of the oil and gas industry; the party&#x27;s blueprint for an independent Scotland in 2013 was predicated on tax revenue earned from domestic oil production, while Sturgeon had predicted in the run-up to the referendum that, &quot;We&#x27;re on the verge of another North Sea bonanza&quot;.

This shift in position was welcomed by the Scottish Green party but Greenpeace criticised Sturgeon for not coming out more strongly against the oil field. &quot;The First Minister must stop hiding behind Boris Johnson&quot;, a spokesperson for the organisation said. &quot;If she wants to show leadership on climate she must clearly say: stop Cambo.&quot; In November 2021, although no assessment had taken place, Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament she believed the oilfield &quot;should not get the green light&quot;.

==== Caledonian MacBrayne ferry delay ====

In the late 2010s, Scottish islanders began to complain that the ageing ferry fleet that connected them to the mainland had become increasingly unreliable. During the winter of 2022 only one in three sailings to the island of Coll went ahead; Hebridean shopkeepers kept receiving deliveries of rotten food;
while other islanders said they had missed doctors&#x27; appointments, funerals and even the chance to say goodbye to dying loved ones because of cancelled sailings.

The Scottish Government had commissioned two new ferries for £97m from Ferguson&#x27;s shipyard in 2015, but the construction of the two vessels was beset by delays and complications. In 2022 Audit Scotland concluded that the final price tag for the vessels would be somewhere between £250m and £400m once the ships were finished in 2023. Furthermore, they concluded that the Scottish Government had awarded the contracts without normal financial safeguards and presided over a &quot;multitude of failings&quot;.

Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament of her &quot;deep regret&quot; that islanders were enduring such chaos, and said that the government was &quot;learning lessons from this experience&quot;. Key documentation, which might have explained why ministers signed the contracts without appropriate safeguards to protect taxpayers&#x27; money, was lost and Sturgeon later said this too was &quot;regrettable&quot; and that &quot;the government will learn lessons.&quot;

==== Second independence referendum proposals ====

In June 2022, Sturgeon officially unveiled plans for Scottish independence once again. She argued that her government had an &quot;indisputable mandate&quot; for a second Scottish independence referendum. She argued that independence would allow Scotland to set out &quot;a different and better vision&quot; and claimed that there is a legally secure path to get a referendum without permission from the cabinet. This plan has been met with condemnation from various opposing parties, with the Prime Minister rejecting her plan.

Sturgeon scheduled the referendum for 19 October 2023. She sought the Prime Minister to consent to the vote by signing a section 30 order, a move that Downing Street has refused to comply. She asked Scotland&#x27;s Lord Advocate to consider referring the matter to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom to rule if the Scottish Government has the power to host a referendum without the Government of the United Kingdom&#x27;s approval, this request has since been granted.

In October 2022, Sturgeon launched her government&#x27;s third independence paper, which outlines the currency in an independent Scotland and joining the EU. She proposed the Scottish Government would use the pound sterling for a brief period before transitioning to a new currency known as the &#x27;Scottish Pound&#x27;. She argued independence would be &quot;essential&quot; for economic prosperity for Scotland as she claimed the economic climate throughout the UK does not offer strength, stability or security.

On the day the Supreme Court ruled the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate a referendum on independence, Sturgeon declared the next democratic election in Scotland - in this case a UK general election expected to be held in 2024 - would be campaigned by the SNP as a de facto referendum. Unionist parties have rejected this characterisation. Some SNP members urged Sturgeon to call an early election at Holyrood to speed up the process for a de facto referendum.

==== Gender recognition reforms ====

As part of the SNP&#x27;s 2016 manifesto policy, the SNP pledged to voters that it would review and reform the way that trans people change their legal gender. However, the policy divided the party and the bill was delayed during Sturgeon&#x27;s second term in office because of opposition to the policy and the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2021 SNP manifesto, Sturgeon committed the party once again to reform the Gender Recognition Act 2004 of the UK Parliament and in August that year included the commitment in her agreement with the Scottish Greens on power-sharing.

In September 2021, Sturgeon was accused of shutting down debate about gender reforms after she described concerns about gender recognition reform as &quot;not valid&quot; and campaign groups and analysts complained that their concerns were being ignored.

On 22 December 2022, the Scottish Parliament voted 86 to 39 to pass the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill which was introduced by Sturgeon&#x27;s government. On 17 January 2023, the UK Government decided to invoke, for the first time, section 35 of the Scottish Act 1998, to make an order which prevented the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill from gaining Royal Assent. She opposed the decision made and criticised Scottish Secretary Alister Jack for blocking the bill and said that the decision was an attack on the Scottish Parliament and Scottish democracy as a whole and said that the matter would be brought to the courts.

In 2023, Sturgeon was criticised in connection with the case of Isla Bryson, a transgender woman who had raped two women prior to her transition. On this basis, Bryson was initially sent to a women&#x27;s prison but was later moved to a men&#x27;s prison. Sturgeon refused to say if she regards Bryson as a man or woman, though she used female pronouns when talking about Bryson.

==== Resignation ====

On 15 February 2023, Sturgeon resigned as first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, pending a leadership election. At a press conference in Bute House, Sturgeon insisted that her resignation was not due to &quot;short term pressures&quot; and stated that the job &quot;takes its toll on you&quot;. Sturgeon stated that she believed that her successor would lead Scotland to independence and that she would look on with pride whoever takes on the role.

While appearing on a podcast for BBC Scotland, Sturgeon would later say that internet speculation about her life was a part of the reason she decided to stand down from her position as first minister, specifically referring to rumours regarding her sexuality, love life and property portfolio as being wildly inaccurate.

=== Domestic issues ===

==== Drugs deaths crisis ====

In 2016, the Scottish Government cut direct funding to drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes from £69.2 million to £53.8 million – a drop of 22%. At the time, Scottish Drugs Forum Chief Executive David Liddell said he was concerned that the cuts had &quot;the potential to increase harm and drug-related deaths.&quot; That year 867 Scots lost their lives to drugs – an increase of 23% on the previous year&#x27;s figure – and the SNP insisted it was part of a trend seen across much of Europe. In December 2020, figures were released revealing that 1,264 people in Scotland had died from drug overdoses in 2019 – the highest number in Europe per head and more than double the number in 2014. Sturgeon sacked her Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick, and in April 2021 said of the crisis: &quot;I think we took our eye off the ball.&quot;

The crisis has particularly impacted the homeless in Scotland: 216 homeless people died in Scotland in 2019 – an increase of 11% on the previous year; over half (54%) of these deaths were drug-related. Per head, Scotland&#x27;s death rate among the homeless is the highest in Britain.

In August 2021, the Scottish Government announced there had been 1,339 drug deaths in the previous year – a new record high. Sturgeon tweeted that the figures were &quot;unacceptable, each one a human tragedy&quot;, while the Scottish Liberal Democrats said: &quot;It was Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s choice to ignore this unfolding epidemic. Issuing apologies now is too late for thousands of people. The victims of drugs and their families were failed. It is a scar on the conscience of this Scottish Government.&quot;

In July 2022, the figures for 2021 were released, revealing that 1,330 had died – nine fewer than in 2020. Annemarie Ward, chief executive at the FAVOR Scotland charity, said: &quot;Nicola Sturgeon said she would make it her national mission to save lives – but we&#x27;re still losing more than 1000 people a year. The national mission is failing.&quot;

==== Education performance ====
In 2015, Sturgeon said that she planned to make education her &quot;defining priority&quot; while in office. In particular, she said she hoped to focus on closing the attainment gap between the richest and poorest children in Scottish schools, telling journalists: &quot;Let me be clear – I want to be judged on this. If you are not, as First Minister, prepared to put your neck on the line on the education of our young people then what are you prepared to. It really matters.&quot;

In 2021, Audit Scotland concluded: &quot;Progress on closing the poverty-related attainment gap between the most and least deprived school pupils has been limited&quot; and fell short of the Government&#x27;s aims. In some local authorities, the attainment gap between the richest and poorest students had widened.

===International relations===
While foreign policy remains a reserved matter, Sturgeon has undertaken a number of visits to Europe, North America and Asia to promote Scotland as a place of investment and Scottish businesses to trade and do business with. Sturgeon has committed to strengthening links between Scotland and Africa.

====European Union====
In response to the Brexit vote, to discuss Scotland&#x27;s interests, Sturgeon travelled to Brussels to meet with both Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission as well as Martin Schulz, the President of the European Parliament. In response to the UK-wide vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, the Scottish Government, headed by Sturgeon, launched the &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Place in Europe&quot; document, a white paper setting out the Scottish government&#x27;s aims and wishes of Scotland&#x27;s role in Europe post-Brexit. The paper was sent to the central British Government to be read by Prime Minister Theresa May.

In June 2017, Sturgeon criticised the approaches taken by both Theresa May and the British Government towards the Brexit approach, claiming that May &quot;will struggle&quot; as she is a &quot;difficult person to build a rapport with&quot;. In the same interview, Sturgeon committed to no independence referendum being held prior to the terms of a UK wide Brexit deal being agreed and presented.

With a view towards Brexit, Sturgeon demanded greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, arguing that Brexit is threatening Scotland&#x27;s devolution settlement. With London seeking to restrict immigration to the United Kingdom, she asserted that Scotland should be able to set its own immigration policy, as well as policies relating to employment and trade.

====United States====

Sturgeon was highly critical of Donald Trump and his policies during the 2016 United States presidential election and had publicly backed his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Sturgeon highlighted her disapproval of his language and views relating to sexism and misogyny, and stated upon Trump&#x27;s victory that she hopes &quot;Trump turns out to be a president different to the one he was during his campaign and reaches out to those who felt vilified by his campaign&quot;.

Sturgeon had previously stripped Trump of his ambassadorial role for Scottish businesses with the Scottish government in the aftermath of Trump&#x27;s views of an outright ban of Muslims from entering the United States. Sturgeon claimed following comments made by Trump in relation to Muslims entering the United States that he was &quot;not fit&quot; for the ambassadorial role with the Scottish government.

In May 2022, Sturgeon made a trip to the United States and met with controversial Republican member of Congress Robert Aderholt, a prominent anti-abortion supporter.

====Spain====
In the run up to the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon offered her own personal backing and that of the Scottish Government to Catalonia in the holding of a referendum. The Government of Spain criticised Sturgeon, claiming she had &quot;totally misunderstood&quot; the situation in Spain and Catalonia. Sturgeon highlighted that Spain should follow &quot;the shining example&quot; that was created as part of the Edinburgh Agreement between the Scottish and British governments that allowed Scotland to hold a legally binding referendum.

==Political positions==

=== Constitutional affairs ===

==== Scottish independence ====
An advocate for Scottish independence, Sturgeon has campaigned for independence from the United Kingdom since her late teens. She was categorised in 2015 as part of the SNP&#x27;s gradualist wing, which believed in achieving independence through accumulating the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s powers from the UK Parliament over time. In recent years, following the defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign in 2014 Scottish Independence referendum, Sturgeon has aligned herself with the new gradualist wing, who believe in only holding a second referendum if there is clear public support, such as polling being over 60%, or if there is a material change in circumstances.

==== Monarch ====

Sturgeon is a constitutional monarchist, telling journalists that it is &quot;a model that has many merits&quot;. On the day Queen Elizabeth II became Britain&#x27;s longest reigning monarch, Sturgeon travelled with her to open the Borders Railway and told a crowd of well-wishers: &quot;She [The Queen] has carried out her duties with dedication, wisdom and an exemplary sense of public service. The reception she has received today, demonstrates that that admiration and affection is certainly felt here in Scotland.&quot;

Following the death of the Queen Elizabeth II, Sturgeon led tributes to the Queen. She described the Queen as the &quot;greatest constant in our national life&quot; and added her death was &quot;a day for reflection and remembrance&quot; and &quot;a day for giving thanks to The Queen for her devotion to duty and the decades of public service she gave to the people of Scotland.&quot;

=== Economic policy ===
She has at times been a critic of austerity, saying that the UK government&#x27;s &quot;austerity economics&quot; is &quot;morally unjustifiable and economically unsustainable&quot;. However, in 2018, she endorsed her party&#x27;s Growth Commission report that pledged to reduce an independent Scotland&#x27;s budget deficit as a percentage of GDP – something the Institute for Fiscal Studies concluded meant &quot;continued austerity&quot;.

=== Social issues ===

==== Women&#x27;s rights ====
Sturgeon has also campaigned on women&#x27;s rights and gender equality, and is a self-described feminist; she has argued that Scotland&#x27;s feminist movement is not simply symbolic, but &quot;sends a powerful signal about equality&quot;. She has hailed Scottish feminist economist Ailsa McKay as one of her inspirations. She has at various points commented on the behaviour or attitudes of men towards women; publicly condemning Donald Trump, Tony Abbott and former Labour MSP Neil Findlay. However, she defended her party&#x27;s leader Alex Salmond from accusations of sexism. After Salmond had told Conservative MP Anna Soubry, &quot;Behave yourself, woman&quot; in 2015, Sturgeon said: &quot;The fundamental question, &#x27;does that language indicate that Alex Salmond is sexist?&#x27; Absolutely not, there&#x27;s no man I know who is less sexist.&quot;

Commenting on the need for men to challenge their friends&#x27; misogynistic behaviour, Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament in 2021: &quot;I would say to all men in this chamber and all men across the country — challenge it [misogyny] if it&#x27;s on the part of other men you may know, challenge your own behaviour and then let&#x27;s collectively, as a society, turn the page and turn the corner so that women can live free of the fear of harassment, abuse, intimidation, violence and, in the worst cases, death.&quot;

==== Transgender rights ====
Ahead of the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Sturgeon pledged to review and reform the way that trans people change their legal gender. However, proposed changes to Scotland&#x27;s Gender Recognition Act that would have allowed people to change their identity through self-identification, rather than a medical process, were paused in June 2019. Critics of the changes within the SNP had accused Sturgeon of being &quot;out of step&quot; on the issue, and expressed concerns that the reforms would be open to abuse and allow predatory men into women&#x27;s spaces. The Scottish Government said it had paused the legislation in order to find &quot;maximum consensus&quot; on the issue and commentators described the issue as having divided the SNP like no other, with many dubbing the debate a &quot;civil war&quot;.

In April 2020, the reforms were again delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In January 2021, a former trans officer in the SNP&#x27;s LGBT wing, Teddy Hope, quit the party, claiming it was one of the &quot;core hubs of transphobia in Scotland&quot;. Large numbers of LGBT activists followed suit and Sturgeon released a video message in which she said that transphobia is &quot;not acceptable&quot; and said she hoped they would re-join the party.

In the 2021 SNP manifesto, Sturgeon committed the party once again to reform the Gender Recognition Act and in August that year included the commitment in her agreement with the Scottish Greens on power-sharing. In September 2021, Sturgeon was accused of shutting down debate about gender reforms after she described concerns about gender recognition reform as &quot;not valid&quot; and campaign groups and analysts complained that their concerns were being ignored.

On 22 December 2022, the Scottish Parliament voted 86 to 39 to pass the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill which was introduced by Sturgeon&#x27;s government, but the bill was vetoed by the UK government.

In 2023, Sturgeon was criticised in connection with the Isla Bryson case, in which a transgender woman who had raped two women when named Adam Graham began self-identifying as a woman after being charged. Bryson was sent to a women&#x27;s prison before being moved to a men&#x27;s prison. Sturgeon refused to say if she regards Bryson as a man or woman, though she used female pronouns when talking about Bryson.

=== Nuclear weapons ===
Sturgeon has campaigned against replacing the Trident nuclear weapons system.

=== Views on Conservative government policies ===
At the SNP&#x27;s 2022 annual party conference in Aberdeen, Sturgeon stated: &quot;I detest the Tories and everything they stand for&quot; in an interview on the BBC. She was accused of using &quot;dangerous language&quot; and when asked if she regretted the comments, Sturgeon simply replied &quot;no&quot; and emphasised the point she detested Tory policies and not supporters or voters.

Sturgeon has been highly critical towards the leadership of Boris Johnson&#x27;s government. Following Johnson&#x27;s appointment as British prime minister, she claimed he &quot;rambled&quot; in his first speech outside 10 Downing Street and suggested he was &quot;blame shifting&quot;. In July 2019, the prime minister met Sturgeon at her official residence, Bute House, where Johnson was &quot;booed and heckled&quot; by protesters. This was the only occasion when he made a formal visit to Edinburgh, as he declined future invites by the first minister. Sturgeon claimed Johnson&#x27;s &quot;fragile male ego&quot; stopped him from meeting her. Sturgeon&#x27;s attempts to request approval for a second referendum on Scottish independence were declined by the Johnson administration. Speaking after Johnson had resigned in 2022, Sturgeon said that he was the only prime minister she had worked with who was &quot;a disgrace to the office&quot;.

== Post premiership (2023–present) ==
Upon her resignation as First Minister, Sturgeon returned to the backbench, where she continues to serve as the MSP for Glasgow Southside. On 7 September 2023, she made her first speech in parliament since her arrest.

=== SNP finance fraud inquiry and arrest ===
In the latter half of Sturgeon&#x27;s leadership of the SNP, a Police Scotland fraud inquiry was launched to investigate the spending of money that was raised specifically for independence campaigning. She dismissed claims the investigation was a result of her resignation as party leader and first minister. On 5 April 2023, Sturgeon&#x27;s husband and the party&#x27;s former chief executive, Peter Murrell, was arrested at their Glasgow residence and their home was searched amid the ongoing investigation. The SNP&#x27;s HQ in Edinburgh and several other addresses related to party officials were also searched by police. Murrell was later released without charge and Sturgeon pulled out of a UN climate event.

On 16 April, a meeting of the party&#x27;s ruling body in March 2021 was leaked by a member to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which showed Sturgeon warning members to be &quot;very careful&quot; about suggesting claims there were financial problems within the SNP. The following day, it was revealed Sturgeon would work remotely from parliament as a spokesperson stated: &quot;in order to ensure the focus of this week is on the new First Minister setting out his priorities for the people of Scotland, Ms Sturgeon has always intended to participate remotely and intends to return to Holyrood in the near future.&quot;. In that same week, the SNP&#x27;s treasurer, Colin Beatie, was arrested and later released without charge. Beatie subsequently resigned from the role. Sturgeon&#x27;s successor, Humza Yousaf, has had calls by opposition for her party membership to be suspended, however, he has rejected these calls.

Widespread speculation that Sturgeon could be arrested for police questioning amid the ongoing inquiry came to fruition when, on 11 June 2023, Sturgeon was arrested by Police Scotland over the investigation into the finances of her SNP party, which reportedly diverted £600,000 meant for the Scottish Independence campaign elsewhere. She was released without charge pending further investigation later that day. On 23 May 2024 Police Scotland handed a prosecution report in relation to Peter Murrell to the Crown Office who confirmed that a &quot;53 year-old woman&quot; also remained under investigation.

=== COVID-19 inquiry ===
Sturgeon is facing a potential criminal inquiry in 2024 after it was disclosed that all her WhatsApp messages during the pandemic had been deleted despite being instructed by the government to retain all information in 2021 and again in 2022 and having agreed to provide them in 2021 to the UK COVID-19 Inquiry.

===Death of Alex Salmond===

Alex Salmond, Sturgeon&#x27;s predecessor as first minister and whom Sturgeon described as her &quot;political mentor&quot;, died on 12 October 2024 whilst in North Macedonia. Following the announcement of his death, Sturgeon claimed that both she and Salmond &quot;formed one of the most successful partnerships in UK politics&quot;. In the years prior to Salmond&#x27;s death, both individuals became embroiled in a public feud and their relationship broke down significantly, becoming the subject of the BBC Scotland documentary &quot;Salmond and Sturgeon: A Troubled Union&quot; which was first broadcast on 12 September 2024, exactly one month prior to Salmond&#x27;s death.

As a result of their deteriorated relationship, Sturgeon was not invited to Salmond&#x27;s funeral which was held in Strichen in Aberdeenshire on 29 October 2024. It was later confirmed by the Scottish Government that Sturgeon and incumbent first minister John Swinney (who served in Salmond&#x27;s government cabinets alongside Sturgeon) were not invited to the funeral upon the wishes of Salmond&#x27;s family. Sturgeon did not attend the memorial service to Salmond in the Scottish Parliament on 30 October, claiming it would &quot;not feel right to attend&quot; and she would honour him in private.

== Public image and legacy ==
At the beginning of Sturgeon&#x27;s political career, she was often regarded as a &quot;nippy sweetie&quot;, Scottish slang for the &quot;sharp-tongued and strong-minded&quot;. The term was used to describe Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;fierce&quot; attitude. Conversely, newspapers ideologically opposed to the SNP, such as the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;The Scottish Sun&quot;, and &quot;The Spectator&quot; have repeatedly and derogatorily compared Sturgeon to &quot;Wee Jimmy Krankie&quot;, a character from Scottish comedy duo The Krankies.

Sturgeon was elected leader of the SNP at a time in which the party enjoyed a surge in membership. In 2015, Sturgeon was described in a &quot;Daily Mail&quot; headline as the &quot;most dangerous woman in Britain&quot;. It followed her party&#x27;s unprecedented gains in the 2015 general election, which questioned the future of the union.

Sturgeon and her party experienced a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to her willingness to communicate with the public and the Press through regular, televised briefings, and her willingness to take responsibility for her government&#x27;s mistakes. This contrasted to then-PM Boris Johnson&#x27;s approach, who was &quot;less proactive and more evasive when it came to dealing with the press&quot;.

The circumstances of Sturgeon&#x27;s resignation in 2023, as well as her appearances at the 2024 UK COVID-19 Inquiry left a question mark over her political legacy. A wide range of media outlets were quick to condemn her reputation, including &quot;Politico Europe&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;BBC News&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Week&quot; and the &quot;i&quot;.

Nonetheless, public polling shows that Sturgeon remains a popular figure in Scottish and wider UK politics, with 46% of Scots having a favourable opinion of her in 2023 YouGov polling and 50% seeing her as having &quot;been a good leader for Scotland&quot;. On leaving office, she was the most popular party leader in the UK according to Ipsos polling. Her popular reputation suffered following her appearance at the 2024 COVID-19 inquiry and revelations she had deleted Whatsapp messages; however, polling has differed and there is still evidence of high trust towards her, usually along partisan lines.

There is evidence that Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s popularity had an effect on the 2023 SNP leadership race which saw Humza Yousaf elected as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland. Yousaf was widely regarded as Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;continuity candidate&quot;, having previously worked as Sturgeon&#x27;s Cabinet Secretary for Justice (2018–2021) and for Health (2021–2023). Hence, SNP members with a favourable view of Sturgeon were more likely to elect Yousaf, whereas those more critical of the outgoing FM were more likely to vote for his opponents, Kate Forbes and Ash Regan.

Sturgeon plans to publish a memoir with Pan MacMillan in 2025.

==Awards and acknowledgements==
Sturgeon won the Scottish Politician of the Year Award in 2008, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2019.

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Sturgeon as the 50th most powerful woman in the world in 2016 and 2nd in the United Kingdom. She was recognized as one of the BBC&#x27;s 100 women of 2014. In 2015, BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; assessed Sturgeon to be the most powerful and influential woman in the United Kingdom.

==Personal life==

Sturgeon lives in Broomhouse, Glasgow with her husband, Peter Murrell, who is the former chief executive officer of the SNP. The couple have been in a relationship since 2003. They got engaged on 29 January 2010, and were married on 16 July 2010 at Òran Mór in Glasgow. On 13 January 2025, Sturgeon announced in a post on Instagram that she and Murrell had separated and are to divorce.

Sturgeon is known for her love of fiction and says reading &quot;gives me a lot of joy and helps with the stresses and strains of work&quot;.

Her mother Joan was the SNP Provost of North Ayrshire council, where she was councillor for the Irvine East ward from 2007 until 2016.

In 2016, Sturgeon disclosed that she had miscarried five years previously.

In May 2022, Sturgeon tested positive for COVID-19. In line with Government guidance, she completed a self-isolation period.

<doc id="579572" wikidata="Q630823" url="?curid=579572" title="Sancho Panza">
<text>Sancho Panza (; ) is a fictional character in the novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot; written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra in 1605. Sancho acts as squire to Don Quixote and provides comments throughout the novel, known as &quot;sanchismos&quot;, that are a combination of broad humour, ironic Spanish proverbs, and earthy wit. &quot;Panza&quot; in Spanish means &quot;belly&quot; (cf. English &quot;paunch,&quot; Italian &quot;pancia&quot;, several Italian dialects &quot;panza&quot;, Portuguese and Galician &quot;pança&quot;, French &quot;panse&quot;, Romanian &quot;pântec&quot;, Catalan &quot;panxa&quot;).

==&quot;Don Quixote&quot;==

Before a fit of madness turned Alonso Quijano into Don Quixote, Sancho Panza was indeed his servant. 
When the novel begins, Sancho has been married for a long time to a woman named Teresa Cascajo and has a daughter, María Sancha (also named Marisancha, Marica, María, Sancha, and Sanchica), who is said to be old enough to be married. Sancho&#x27;s wife is described more or less as a feminine version of Sancho, both in looks and behaviour. When Don Quixote proposes Sancho to be his squire, neither he nor his family strongly oppose it.

Sancho is illiterate and proud of it but by influence of his new master, he develops considerable knowledge about some books.
Sancho provides the earthy wisdom of Spanish proverbs, surprising his master. During the travels with Don Quixote, he keeps contact with his wife by dictating letters addressed to her.

Sancho Panza offers interpolated narrative voice throughout the tale, a literary convention invented by Cervantes. Sancho Panza is precursor to &quot;the sidekick,&quot; and is symbolic of practicality over idealism. Sancho is the everyman, who, though not sharing his master&#x27;s delusional &quot;enchantment&quot; until late in the novel, remains his ever-faithful companion realist, and functions as the clever sidekick. 
Salvador de Madariaga detected that, as the book progresses, there is a &quot;Quixotization&quot; of Sancho and a &quot;Sanchification&quot; of Don Quixote, so much that, when the knight recovers sanity on his deathbed, it is Sancho who tries to convince him to become pastoral shepherds.

In the novel, Don Quixote comments on the historical state and condition of Aragón and Castilla, which are vying for power in Europe. Sancho Panza represents, among other things, the quintessentially Spanish brand of skepticism of the period.

Sancho obediently follows his master, despite being sometimes puzzled by Quixote&#x27;s actions. Riding a donkey, he helps Quixote get out of various conflicts while looking forward to rewards of &quot;aventura&quot; that Quixote tells him of.

==&quot;Don Quixote, Part Two&quot;==
===Sancho&#x27;s name===
Cervantes variously names Sancho in the first book Sancho Zancas (legs); however, in the second book, he standardizes Sancho&#x27;s name in reply to the &quot;false&quot; Avellaneda Quixote sequel. At one point, Sancho alludes to the &quot;false&quot; Avellaneda book by addressing his wife (standardized as Teresa Panza) using the wrong name. The Sancho name does not change, but he calls his wife various names throughout the first part of the volume, and her &#x27;true&#x27; name is not revealed until almost the end of that portion of the novel.

===The promised insula===
Don Quixote promises Sancho the governance of an &quot;ínsula&quot;, or island. However, Sancho has never heard of this word before and does not know its meaning. Sancho has long been expecting some vague but concrete reward for this adventure and believes the word to signify the prize that will make the trouble he has been enduring worthwhile.

The two later encounter a duke and duchess who pretend to make Sancho governor of a fictional fief, &quot;la ínsula Barataria&quot; (roughly &quot;Isle Come-cheaply&quot;; see Cockaigne). He eagerly accepts and leaves his master. In a letter, Don Quixote gives Sancho provincial advice on governorship gleaned from the romances he has read, thought to have been inspired by the &quot;Diálogo de Mercurio y Carón&quot; attributed to Alfonso de Valdés (-1532). Cervantes may intend Quixote&#x27;s simplistic and romantic understanding of government as an allegory
satirizing the lack of practical learning on the part of philosopher-doctors placed in positions of power. One view sees the advice as a &quot;serio-comic twist on Machiavelli&#x27;s advice for nonhereditary rulers who newly acquire kingdoms&quot;.

The Duke&#x27;s servants are instructed to play several pranks upon Sancho. Surprisingly, Sancho is able to rule justly (mostly), applying common (if occasionally inconsistent) sense and practical wisdom in spite of - or because of - the simplistic advice that Don Quixote has read about. As Sancho is abused in these staged parodies, he learns how difficult it is to rule, and &quot;resigns&quot; to rejoin Don Quixote and to continue the adventure.

===Ricote===

Sancho encounters Ricote (&quot;fat cat&quot;), his former Morisco neighbor, who has buried a small fortune. Ricote, like all Moriscos, was expelled from Spain and has returned in disguise to retrieve the treasure he left behind. He asks Sancho for his help. Sancho, while sympathetic, refuses to betray his king.

When Don Quixote takes to his deathbed, Sancho tries to cheer him. Sancho idealistically proposes they become pastoral shepherds and thus becomes &#x27;Quixotized&#x27;.

==Other appearances of the character==

===Broadway musical===

In addition to stage and screen adaptations of the novel itself, Sancho Panza is a major character in the play within a play in the Broadway musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, and in the film of the same name. In &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, the newly imprisoned Cervantes recruits his fellow prisoners to portray characters from his novel, with Cervantes himself playing Don Quixote and his manservant playing Sancho. Sancho sings the title song as a duet with Quixote, solos &quot;The Missive&quot;, &quot;I like him&quot;, and &quot;A Little Gossip&quot;, plus ensemble numbers &quot;Golden Helmet of Mambrino&quot; and &quot;The Dubbing&quot;. Actors who have played Sancho in the play include Irving Jacobson (who also sang on the original cast album), Tony Martinez (1977 and 1992 revivals), and Ernie Sabella (2002 revival). James Coco played the character in the 1972 film.

===Ship===
&quot;Sancho Panza&quot; of Boston was an 1855 medium clipper ship of 876 tons, built in Medford, MA by Samuel Lapham, and owned by John E. Lodge &amp; Co. The ship was renamed &quot;Nimrod&quot; in 1863, upon sale to British owners, resold to German owners, and re-rigged as a bark. &quot;Sancho Panza&quot; was bound for Liverpool, having left Pictou, N.S. on Oct. 31, 1890, but was not heard from again.

==Additional appearances==

*The Sancho Panza name is used for a cigar brand originating in Cuba in 1852. While it is still made in Cuba, a Honduran version made by General Cigar was introduced in 2001 for the United States market.
*Panza is depicted in Pablo Picasso&#x27;s 1955 drawing &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.
*In The Stranglers&#x27; song &quot;No More Heroes&quot;, as well as a song entitled &quot;Sancho Panza&quot; by the Swedish twee pop group Hello Saferide. The name was also featured in the Bush track titled &quot;Monkey&quot; from the album Sixteen Stone.
*The proposed name of a part of the planned Don Quijote space probe is &quot;Sancho&quot;. Sancho would stand back and observe while the second part, &quot;Hidalgo&quot;, slammed into an asteroid.
*Sancho Panza is parodied as Sancho Panda, the panda sidekick in &quot;The Adventures of Don Coyote and Sancho Panda&quot; by Hanna-Barbera.
*Sancho Panza is a character in the tone poem &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Richard Strauss, in which he is represented by the solo viola, as well as the tenor tuba and bass clarinet playing in unison.
*Sancho Panza is the main character in &quot;The Musical Sancho Panza&quot; by José Luis Narom, premiered in Madrid in 2005.
*Sancho Panza is parodied as Sancho Pansa in a Super Nintendo Entertainment System game titled &quot;Jimmy Connors Pro Tennis&quot;.
*In the video game &quot;Limbus Company&quot;, Sancho Panza is portrayed as a woman, and the original Don Quixote&#x27;s &quot;kindred&quot; who is unknowingly living out his dream of becoming a Fixer, a corporate mercenary who serves as a law enforcement arm of the City, joining the main characters under his name as an alias.
* In the video game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, the female Phantom Spirit who takes the name of Sancho Panza is a mixture of multiple characters in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, namely Sancho himself, the horse Rocinante, the princess Dulcinea, and the Duchess&#x27;s maid Altisidora. As part of a duo, she is summoned as part of Don Quixote&#x27;s Spirit Origin as a Lancer-class Servant, and her loyalty lies entirely to Quixote. Sancho mainly takes the appearance of a maid, but she can also change it to that of a princess or a horse of light.

<text>Bengt Georg Daniel Strömgren (21 January 1908 – 4 July 1987) was a Danish astronomer and astrophysicist.

== Life and career ==
Bengt Strömgren was born in Gothenburg. His parents were Hedvig Strömgren (née Lidforss) and Elis Strömgren, who was professor of astronomy at the University of Copenhagen and director of the University Observatory in Copenhagen. Bengt grew up in the professor&#x27;s mansion surrounded with scientists, assistants, observers and guests. His father paced and promoted Bengt into a life with science, and Bengt&#x27;s first paper was published already at the age of 14. He graduated from high school in 1925 and enrolled at the Copenhagen university. Only two years later, he graduated in astronomy and atomic physics, and during the following two years, he completed a doctoral degree, which was evaluated with the best marks in December 1929, when he was 21 years old.

He gained a great deal of useful experience from his studies in theoretical physics at Niels Bohr&#x27;s Institute close by, and he was at the right place at the right time. He soon found out that he intended to use the fresh theoretical framework of quantum physics in space, and investigate the applications of quantum mechanics in stars. Obviously, questions of nepotism were in play when he applied for an assistantship already in 1925, which he didn&#x27;t get. But only one year later it was given to him anyway — he was the best, regardless of his employer being also his own father.

After being appointed as lecturer at the university in 1932, Strömgren was invited to the University of Chicago in 1936 by Otto Struve. Going abroad for 18 months meant a lot to the young researcher, and when he went back to Denmark and to the rising national socialism in Europe, he succeeded his father&#x27;s professorship in 1940. During five years of isolation, under the German occupation of Denmark, he initiated the building of a new Danish Observatory, the Brorfelde Observatory. But after the Second World War, Bengt Strömgren became tired of lacking state funding for the project, and with a stagnant national economy, he felt that he had to leave Danish research, which he did in 1951.

He went to the United States and became director of the Yerkes and McDonald Observatories, and stayed there for six years. In 1957, he was appointed the first professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he got Albert Einstein&#x27;s office. He stayed at Princeton with his family until 1967, when he went back to his homeland Denmark, and became the next to the last resident in a series of great Danish scientists of the Carlsberg Mansion and Honor, which had earlier been occupied by Niels Bohr among others. In 1987, he died after a short period of illness.

== Science ==
Bengt Strömgren made momentous contributions to astrophysics. He found that the chemical composition of stars was very much different than previously assumed. In the late 1930s, he found the relative abundance of hydrogen to be nearly 70%, and helium to be about 27%. Just before the war, he discovered the so-called Strömgren Spheres — huge interstellar shells of ionized hydrogen around stars. And in the 1950s and 1960s, he pioneered photoelectric photometry with a novel four-colour system, now called Strömgren photometric system. Apart from the Danish observatory of Brorfelde, Strömgren was active in the early organisation of the joint European observatory of ESO at La Silla in Chile.

<text>A knight-errant (or knight errant) is a figure of medieval chivalric romance literature. The adjective &quot;errant&quot; (meaning &quot;wandering, roving&quot;) indicates how the knight-errant would wander the land in search of adventures to prove his chivalric virtues, either in knightly duels (&quot;pas d&#x27;armes&quot;) or in some other pursuit of courtly love.

==Description==
The knight-errant is a character who has broken away from the world of his origin, in order to go off on his own to right wrongs or to test and assert his own chivalric ideals. In medieval Europe, knight-errantry existed in literature, though fictional works from this time often were presented as non-fiction.

The template of the knight-errant were the heroes of the Round Table of the Arthurian cycle such as Gawain, Lancelot, and Percival. The quest in pursuit of which these knights wandered the lands is that of the Holy Grail, such as in &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot; written by Chrétien de Troyes in the 1180s.

The character of the wandering knight existed in romantic literature as it developed during the late 12th century. However, the term &quot;knight-errant&quot; was to come later; its first extant usage occurs in the 14th-century poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. Knight-errantry tales remained popular with courtly audiences throughout the Late Middle Ages. They were written in Middle French, Middle English, and Middle German.

In the 16th century, the genre became highly popular in the Iberian Peninsula; &quot;Amadis de Gaula&quot; was one of the most successful knight-errantry tales of this period. In &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605), Miguel de Cervantes burlesqued the romances and their popularity. Tales of knight-errantry then fell out of fashion for two centuries, until they re-emerged in the form of the historical novel in Romanticism.

==Romance==
A knight-errant typically performed all his deeds in the name of a lady, and invoked her name before performing an exploit. In more sublimated forms of knight-errantry, pure moralist idealism rather than romantic inspiration motivated the knight-errant (as in the case of Sir Galahad). Such a knight might well be outside the structure of feudalism, wandering solely to perform noble exploits (and perhaps to find a lord to give his service to), but might also be in service to a king or lord, traveling either in pursuit of a specific duty that his overlord charged him with, or to put down evildoers in general. This quest sends a knight on adventures much like the ones of a knight in search of them, as he happens on the same marvels. In &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, St. George is sent to rescue Una&#x27;s parents&#x27; kingdom from a dragon, and Guyon has no such quest, but both knights encounter perils and adventures.

In the romances, his adventures frequently included greater foes than other knights, including giants, enchantresses, or dragons. They may also gain help that is out of ordinary. Sir Ywain assisted a lion against a serpent, and was thereafter accompanied by it, becoming the Knight of the Lion. Other knights-errant have been assisted by wild men of the woods, as in &quot;Valentine and Orson&quot;, or, like Guillaume de Palerme, by wolves that were, in fact, enchanted princes.

==In modern literature==

The protagonist of Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot;, John Grady Cole, is said to be based specifically on Sir Gawain, of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. Both characters share a number of aspects and traits; both are rooted in the myths of a past that no longer exists, and both live by codes of conduct from a previous era.

&quot;Don Quixote&quot; is an early 17th-century parody of the genre, in reaction to the extreme popularity which late medieval romances such as &quot;Amadis de Gaula&quot; came to enjoy in the Iberian Peninsula in the 16th century.

In Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s play &quot;Ondine&quot;, which starred Audrey Hepburn on Broadway in 1954, a knight-errant appears, during a storm, at the humble home of a fisherman and his wife.

A depiction of knight-errantry in the modern historical novel is found in &quot;Sir Nigel&quot; by Arthur Conan Doyle (1906).

The knight-errant stock character became the trope of the &quot;knight in shining armour&quot; in depiction of the Middle Ages in popular culture, and the term came to be used also outside of medieval drama, as in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; as a title of Batman.

In the epic fantasy series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, there is a class of knights referred to as &quot;hedge knights&quot;. A hedge knight is a wandering knight without a master, and many are quite poor. Hedge knights travel the length and breadth of the fictional continent of Westeros looking for gainful employment, and their name comes from the propensity to sleep out in the open air or in forests when they cannot afford lodging. The life of a hedge knight is depicted in the &quot;Tales of Dunk and Egg&quot;.

The protagonist of Lee Child&#x27;s &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; novels, Jack Reacher, is intended by the author as a modern-day reflection of classic lone heroes.

==Bogatyrs of Kievan Rus&#x27;==

East Slavic &quot;bylina&quot; (epic poetry) feature bogatyrs, knights-errant who served as protectors of their homeland, and occasionally as adventurers. Some of them are presumed to be historical figures, while others are fictional and possibly descend from Slavic mythology. Most tales about bogatyrs revolve around the court of Vladimir I of Kiev. Three popular bogatyrs—Ilya Muromets, Dobrynya Nikitich and Alyosha Popovich (famously painted by Victor Vasnetsov)—are said to have served him.

==In East Asian cultures==
Youxia, Chinese knights-errant, traveled solo protecting common folk from oppressive regimes. Unlike their European counterpart, they did not come from any particular social caste and were anything from soldiers to poets. There is even a popular literary tradition that arose during the Tang dynasty which centered on slaves who used supernatural physical abilities to save kidnapped damsels in distress and to swim to the bottom of raging rivers to retrieve treasures for their feudal lords (see Kunlun Nu). A youxia who excels or is renowned for martial prowess or skills is usually called wuxia.

In Japan, the expression &quot;musha shugyō&quot; described the traveling of a samurai who, wanting to test his abilities in real life conditions, would travel the land and engage in duels along the way.

<text>The Commission for Dark Skies (CfDS) (formerly the Campaign for Dark Skies; the name was changed on March 29, 2015) is the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest anti-light-pollution campaign group forming part of the international dark-sky movement.

It is run by the British Astronomical Association (BAA) and affiliated with the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), and composed of a network of local officers (and other members) who try to improve lighting in their areas and advise local people.

The campaign was founded in 1989 by amateur astronomers as a sub-section of the BAA specialising in combatting skyglow. It is now open to non-members of the BAA, includes lighting engineers and environmentalists, and campaigns on the wider effects of light pollution.

In April 2023, the founder and coordinator of CfDS, Robert Mizon MBE died. Following a period of mourning and readjustment, the Commission was relaunched in November 2024 with new officers and committee members, tasked to reinvigorate the campaign to reduce light pollution and preserve and protect the UK&#x27;s dark skies.

==Legislation==

CfDS&#x27;s work with the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee on legislating against light pollution has resulted in the government including provisions in their Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill.

==Dark sky park, island and reserve==

Members of the CfDS have been involved in the following International Dark-Sky Association designations:

* Galloway Forest Park – Dark Sky Park (2009)
* Sark – IDA&#x27;s first international dark-sky island (Silver tier) (2011)
* Exmoor – Dark Sky Reserve (2011)
* Elan Valley Estate (mid-Wales) Dark Sky Park (2015)
* Tomintoul and Glenlivet-Cairngorms Dark Sky Park (2018)

==Publications==

In 2009, the CfDS published its handbook &quot;Blinded by the Light?&quot;.

==Conferences==

* &quot;CfDS 2006&quot;: Dark-Skies Symposium, Portsmouth, UK, September 15–16, 2006.

<doc id="579583" wikidata="Q3040851" url="?curid=579583" title="Grand Fenwick">
<text>The [[Duchy]] of Grand Fenwick is a tiny fictional country created by Leonard Wibberley in a series of comedic novels beginning with &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; (1955), which was made into a 1959 film.

In the novels, Wibberley goes beyond the merely comic, placing the tiny nation (15 square miles/39 square kilometres) in absurd situations so as to comment satirically on contemporary politics and events.

==History and topography==
The Duchy of Grand Fenwick is described as no more than five miles (8 km) long and three miles (5 km) wide and lies in a fold in the Northern Alps. The imaginary country features three valleys, a river, and a mountain with an elevation of . 

The Duchy, ruled by the Duchess Gloriana XII, is described as bordering Switzerland and France in the Alps. Internal evidence points to the Duchy being in the Franche-Comté region in eastern France, near (or on top of) Les Gras.

On the northern slopes are of vineyards. The hillsides where the ground is less fertile support flocks of sheep that provide meat, dairy products, and wool. 

Most of the inhabitants live in the City of Fenwick, which is clustered around Fenwick Castle, the seat of government. The city of Fenwick is also home to the only bar/inn/restaurant in the country, the Gray Goose Pub. 

About 2 miles (3 km) from the City of Fenwick is a Forest Preserve that features a 20-foot (6.1 m) waterfall and attracts many birds that the nation claims as its own native birds. There is a tiny monastery on the border of the forest which also houses the school. 

The Duchy takes its name from its founder, the English knight Sir Roger Fenwick who, while employed by France, settled there with his followers in 1370. Thanks to Sir Roger, the national language is English.

It retains a pre-industrial economy, based almost entirely on clipping wool and pressing Pinot Grand Fenwick wine. However, in the fourth book of the Mouse series, there are two cars in Grand Fenwick, a 1947 Daimler belonging to the Duchess Gloriana, and the other, a 1927 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, belonging to the Count of Mountjoy. There is only one petrol station, which is also the bicycle shop. Aside from these examples, there is no modern technology in the Duchy. The Duchy has a postal service, although mail going outside the Duchy has to be sent to Monaco.

== Government ==
The Duchy of Grand Fenwick is a monarchy led by the Duchess Gloriana XII. In the novel &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot;, she is a young woman of 22, and marries Tully Bascomb. In &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Mouse on Wall Street&quot;, she is in her mid-thirties. In &quot;The Mouse That Saved the West&quot;, she is 42, and Tully has been dead for some time. In the 1959 film version, she is a parody of Queen Victoria who is still wearing mourning for her husband, Prince Louis of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who has been &quot;missing&quot; from a tiger hunt for 27 years. In the film, she thinks the President of the United States is Calvin Coolidge, and she owns the only motorcar in the Duchy–a 1920s&#x27; hand-cranked model. This is not so in the original books. It is not known whether she has any children.

The lower House of the Duchy&#x27;s Parliament, The Council of Freemen, is democratically elected. In &quot;The Mouse on Wall Street&quot; an upper House of Parliament, akin to the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, is mentioned to exist.

The nation has two political parties, the Dilutionists (or Her Grace&#x27;s Loyal Opposition), led by David Bentner, and the Anti-Dilutionists, led by Count Mountjoy, the Prime Minister. The names of the parties reflect their positions on whether to dilute the wine exports of the Duchy. The positions of leadership are hereditary. In &quot;The Mouse on Wall Street&quot;, the Dilutionists are also referred to as the Labor Party.

A double-headed eagle saying &quot;Aye&quot; from one beak and &quot;Nay&quot; from the other. Sir Roger recorded that he only learned three things in his two years at Oxford University:
# That &quot;Aye&quot; might be turned into &quot;Nay&quot; and vice versa if a sufficient quantity of wordage was applied to the matter.
# In any argument the victor is always right.
# Though the pen is mightier than the sword, the sword speaks louder and stronger at any given moment.

==Defence forces==
The Grand Fenwick Expeditionary Force consists of 20 bowmen selected from 700 in the Duchy and three men-at-arms selected from 20 who have the right to carry spear and mace. They are clad in mail and armed with longbows. They are led by Forester Tully Bascomb, appointed High Constable, and Serjeant-at-Arms Will Buckley (who had World War II experience with the British Army).

In &quot;Beware of the Mouse&quot; it is stated that Grand Fenwick&#x27;s constitution is amended to state that no weapon more modern than the longbow will be used by the nation&#x27;s army. The longbow is a vital part of the country&#x27;s history, its borders originally determined by the distance a platoon of bowmen could shoot in each direction. (In real life at the time, the extent of a country&#x27;s territorial waters were defined by the three-mile limit, which is traditionally thought to be based on the effective range of a cannon fired from coastal land toward the sea.)

In the film &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot;, Grand Fenwick is shown to have a small military force dressed similar to the Brigade of Guards and armed with rifles.

==The novels==
In &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; (1955), the Duchy seeks to stop American counterfeiting of Pinot Grand Fenwick. Grand Fenwick&#x27;s formal protests are ignored by U.S. State Department employees, who think the documents are pranks. Grand Fenwick then plans an attack on the United States, certain this will lead to immediate defeat followed by generous American aid. The Grand Fenwick Expeditionary Force lands when the streets of New York are deserted during a nuclear attack drill. Ultimately, they take prisoners and return to Grand Fenwick. One captive is the inventor of the Q-bomb, and the Duchy finds itself the possessor of the only working model of this devastating weapon. Grand Fenwick forms an alliance of small nations, the &quot;Tiny Twenty,&quot; and uses its control of the bomb to obtain world peace.

&quot;Beware of the Mouse&quot; (1958) is set in the Middle Ages and explains the historical origin of Grand Fenwick.

In &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; (1962), Grand Fenwick beats the U.S. and the Soviet Union in a space race by using a new rocket fuel, the secret ingredient for which is found in a &quot;premier grand cru&quot; crop of Pinot Grand Fenwick.

In &quot;The Mouse on Wall Street&quot; (1969), the Duchy disrupts the world&#x27;s finances. In an attempt to dispose of a sizable royalty payment from an American chewing gum company by investing it in failing companies, Duchess Gloriana finds she has the Midas touch for the stock market, and in a flurry of rumor and assumption, the Duchy becomes a financial superpower.

In &quot;The Mouse that Saved the West&quot; (1981), it is discovered that the Duchy is sitting on the largest oil deposit in the world.

==Other appearances==
A 1966 television pilot featuring Sid Caesar in the same roles Peter Sellers performed in the movie (namely the head of state Duchess Gloriana XII, Prime Minister and Count Rupert Mountjoy and the military leader Tully Bascomb) was filmed but never picked up as a series.

Grand Fenwick is mentioned in &quot;The New Traveller&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, part of the series &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;.

In the comic &quot;Aetheric Mechanics&quot;, Grand Fenwick is stated to have been annexed by Ruritania.

In the novel &quot;Sunnyside&quot;, Grand Fenwick is said to have declared war on Germany during World War I.

Grand Fenwick is used in Project Euler to create the context of problem 314.

In the shared alternate history of Ill Bethisad (1997 and after), Grand Fenwick is an actual country located between France and Helvetia (this world&#x27;s version of Switzerland). Within Ill Bethisad, it is the smallest country in the world, being only 15 sq mi (39 km2) in size.

&quot;The Royal Archduke of Grand Fenwick&quot; is a scheme used by Barney Stinson to seduce an art expert in the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;The Ashtray&quot;.

In the shared worldbuilding project of the Otherworld Project (2011 and after), Grand Fenwick is a landlocked country in the continent of Messenia on the Earth-like planet of Arden. Although Arden&#x27;s version shares similarities with other versions of the duchy (such as having a monarchy, its founding by Roger Fenwick and using the double-headed eagle flag), it also has many differences. Arden&#x27;s Grand Fenwick is much larger than its Earth-based counterparts being 548.30 sq mi (1,420.09 km2) in size. It also doesn&#x27;t produce wine and the name of its capital city is &quot;Breck&quot;. The duchy&#x27;s history is also different not only because it&#x27;s on another planet but because the Otherworld Project is based on plausibility and so this version doesn&#x27;t have the more outlandish elements given to Grand Fenwick in the books or movies.

<doc id="579584" wikidata="Q753050" url="?curid=579584" title="EuroCity">
<text>EuroCity (EC) is an international train category and brand for European inter-city trains that cross international borders and meet criteria covering comfort, speed, food service, and cleanliness. Each EC train is operated by more than one European Union or Swiss rail company, under a multilateral co-operative arrangement, and all EC trains link important European cities with each other.

The EuroCity label replaced the older Trans Europ Express (TEE) name for border-crossing trains in Europe. Whereas TEE services were first-class only, EuroCity trains convey first- and second-class coaches. 

==Criteria==

The criteria EuroCity trains are required to meet include the following:
* train through two or more countries
* all cars air-conditioned
* stop only at stations serving major cities
* stops scheduled to last no more than five minutes, in special cases up to 15 minutes
* food and beverages available onboard (preferably from a dining car)
* conductors speak at least two languages, one of which must be English, French, or German
* average speed (including stops) above , exceptions for routes including mountainous terrain and train ferries

The EuroCity schedule was designed with train pairs running one train in both directions, thus resulting in a more frequent service than the TEE, which normally ran only once a day. In 1993 it was decided that EuroCity trains must complete their journey between 6:00 am and midnight. The night services are operated as EuroNight since 23 May 1993.

During the pre-Schengen era, passport checks were conducted on EC trains while in motion, rather than while parked at a station or requiring the passengers to disembark, as was sometimes the case for non-EC trains. A few require pre-reservation (though this is possible and recommended for all other trains) and in some countries a supplemental charge.

==Naming==
Originally all EuroCity trains carried names, and many still do, continuing the practice started with luxury trains of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The names are printed on brochures showing the times of arrival and departure at every stop and details of the journey; these are placed on the seats by the train staff. A few trains have used the names of the earlier Trans Europ Express or InterCity trains that they replaced on the same route, for example &quot;Iris&quot; for Brussels to Zürich. The names were mostly related to the cities and region the trains served and chosen from historical or mythological figures, geographical and botanical names or regional products. 
In 1991, the decision was made to name the EuroCity services after famous Europeans, which in some cases resulted in the renaming of existing services, e.g. the EC trains between Germany and Denmark.

On 29 July 1991, the European Community decided to reorganise the legal structure of the railways in order to stimulate commercial operation and reduce government subsidies. The directive, in force in 1993, stated that railway services and infrastructure should be split and operators should be able to offer their services everywhere in Europe using the national infrastructure. After 20 years the implementation is still ongoing, but it has affected the railway operators already. High-speed services that have been introduced subsequently, using both new rolling stock and some newly built line sections, have all used brand names that are applied to all trains of their class or category, rather than naming every single service. As a consequence of this trend, the named EC trains on the Paris–Brussels–Amsterdam route disappeared in 1995–96, replaced by unnamed TGV trains and later by &quot;Thalys&quot; service. Between the Netherlands and Germany the Intercity-Express (ICE) was introduced in 2000, resulting in the near disappearance of the EuroCity brand on those train routes, and with it the use of train names. For marketing reasons, the four EuroCity services between Germany and Poland were advertised as the &quot;Berlin–Warszawa Express&quot; effective 29 September 2002, thus marketing a product instead of naming individual trains. Preparations for privatisation of Deutsche Bahn led to the discontinuation of names for the EuroCity services in Allgäu on 15 December 2002, and for the other German-operated EC trains on 12 December 2004. The French–Swiss TGV services lost their individual names on 17 May 2003, when &quot;Lyria&quot; was chosen as the brand name used collectively for those TGVs. After the collapse of Cisalpino on 13 December 2009, the named trains between Italy and Switzerland disappeared as well. Farther east, all EC services continue to carry names.

==Network==
On 31 May 1987 the EuroCity network started with 64 EuroCity trains, serving 200 cities in 13 countries. They were made up of 56 day services and eight night services. The network included the international TGVs between France and Switzerland, shown in orange on the 1987 map. Night services are shown in blue on the map, with the exception of the boat-train &quot;Benjamin Britten&quot; (London–Amsterdam), whose overnight portion was by ferry, not by train. The other EuroCity trains are shown in green on the map. The &quot;TEE Gottardo&quot; is shown in red on the map, because it was converted to EuroCity only one year later. Three international InterCity trains did not qualify as EuroCity and are shown on the map in grey.

The network was set up by the national railways of Norway, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, and the European Community. One year later Hungary joined as well. The network grew from 64 services in 1987 to 76 services in 1990, and in 1991 the frequency was improved, resulting in an expansion to 102 services by 1991. Until then it was a mainly West European network but from 1991 it began expanding beyond Hungary in the east. After the historic developments occurring in Central and Eastern Europe regarding the fall of Communism around that time, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia became part of the system in 1991, and Poland in 1992. In the following years Czechoslovakia and later Yugoslavia were split and their parts became individual members too. In 1993 the night services were rebranded as the EuroNight network, the start of a gradual decline in the number of EuroCity trains in Western Europe. When high-speed lines opened in France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and Belgium/Netherlands/Luxembourg, the EuroCity services were replaced by high-speed trains, mostly with their own brands and therefore not classified as EuroCity. In Central and Eastern Europe more services were introduced, and over a period of 25 years the centre of the EC network had shifted east.

==EuroCity-Express==

Since December 2017, the EuroCity label is supplemented by the new classification &quot;EuroCity-Express&quot; (ECE). Initially, this will only be used for a single service; the Frankfurt (Main) to Milan service operated by SBB with their ETR 610 high-speed tilting train. This classification is only used in Germany; in Switzerland and Italy, these trains run as EC. This is due to tariff reasons: in Germany, EC normally are classified below ICE, the highest class, and thus slightly cheaper. ECE however are the same rank as ICE, and are priced as such, as the Deutsche Bahn claims them to provide similar levels of comfort.

<doc id="579586" wikidata="Q2460433" url="?curid=579586" title="Leader of the Opposition (Australia)">
<text>In Australian federal politics, the Leader of the Opposition is an elected member of parliament (MP) in the Australian House of Representatives who leads the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, by convention, is the leader of the largest political party in the House of Representatives that is not in government.

When in parliament, the opposition leader sits on the left-hand side of the centre table, in front of the opposition and opposite the prime minister. The opposition leader is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new leader of the opposition may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership.

Australia is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system and is based on the Westminster model. The term &quot;opposition&quot; has a specific meaning in the parliamentary sense. It is an important component of the Westminster system, with the opposition directing criticism at the government and attempts to defeat and replace the Government. The opposition is therefore known as the &quot;government in waiting&quot; and it is a formal part of the parliamentary system. It is in opposition to the government, but not to the Crown; hence the term &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot;.

To date there have been 35 opposition leaders, 19 of whom also have served terms as prime minister.

The current Leader of the Opposition is Peter Dutton of the Liberal Party, following a leadership election on 30 May 2022. The current Deputy Leader of the Opposition is Sussan Ley, who was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party on the same date.

==Role==
The opposition leader is the opposition&#x27;s counterpart to the prime minister. The opposition leader is expected to be ready to form a new government if the incumbent government is unable to continue in office. This typically occurs when the opposition wins a federal election, after which the opposition leader is appointed prime minister. However, the opposition leader may also be called upon to form government if the incumbent government loses the confidence of the House (most recently in 1941) or if they are otherwise removed by the governor-general (most recently in 1975).

The opposition leader is the head of the shadow ministry, allocating portfolios and, in the case of the Coalition, determining its membership. The opposition leader is assisted by a deputy leader of the opposition, who is also recognised in the standing orders and entitled to an additional salary. Both the opposition leader and deputy opposition leader are entitled to a degree of special preference from the Speaker of the House.

The position of opposition leader has no constitutional basis but exists as a matter of convention in the Westminster system. A 1960 inquiry into parliamentary salaries and allowances observed:
Whereas according to the Coalition agreement the Leader of the National Party serves as Deputy Prime Minister when the Coalition is in government, no such agreement exists when the Coalition is in Opposition, and no National Party politician has ever served as Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

==History==

George Reid became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the opposition in the lead-up to the inaugural 1901 federal election, following the appointment of Edmund Barton to lead a caretaker government as Australia&#x27;s first prime minister. His status was confirmed when the House of Representatives met for the first time after the election. The opposition leader was initially not entitled to any salary or entitlements beyond those of an ordinary member of parliament. As a result, Reid had to maintain his legal practice in Sydney to support himself and was able to attend just over one-third of the sitting days in the first session of parliament.

Although the role was firmly established, the House did not formally recognise the position of opposition leader in its records until 1920. It was recognised by statute for the first time with the passage of the &quot;Parliamentary Allowances Act 1920&quot;, which granted its holder an additional allowance. Prime Minister Andrew Fisher had previously offered Opposition Leader Alfred Deakin an allowance in 1910. Deakin declined, but did accept a paid secretary. In 1931, the office was incorporated into the House&#x27;s standing orders for the first time, with the opposition leader granted the right to exceed the time limit for speeches in certain instances.

==Salary==
The opposition leader&#x27;s salary is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory body. As of 1 July 2019, the incumbent is entitled to a parliamentarian&#x27;s base salary of A$211,250 plus an additional 85% loading, equating to a salary of around $390,000.

<text>Lively Island () is the largest of the Lively Island Group of the Falkland Islands, The island group lies east of East Falkland. Lively Island is the largest rat-free island in the Falklands, hence its importance to birdlife. The island is owned by Steven and Chris Poole who also run a sheep farm on the island. 

==History==
The Spanish name, &quot;Isla Bougainville&quot; (like Port Louis) is named after the French navigator Louis de Bougainville who established the first settlement in the archipelago in the 1760s.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the island was owned by George Cobb. It was sold after World War I to pay taxes.

In the Falklands War the Battle of Seal Cove took place near Lively Island. Seal Cove is a bay in East Falkland directly to the west of the island.

==Description==
Lively Island has an area of . Its highest point is . There are several streams and ponds, the largest of which is Enderby Pond, , an important waterfowl site. Lively is rat-free but with a century and a half of grazing little tussac grass remains and there are many large patches of eroded ground. Habitat restoration work has been started by the current owners by planting tussac and sandgrass on eroded areas. 

Lively Island is surrounded by other, smaller islands and islets in the Lively Island group. Some of these Islets are linked to Lively Island by sandbars. North East Island which is just off the coast of Lively, was the site of a rat eradication programme in 2003. (The rest of the Lively islands are rat free.)

===Important Bird Area===
The Lively Island group has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks, ruddy-headed geese, gentoo penguins (650 breeding pairs), Magellanic penguins, southern giant petrels (40 pairs), white-bridled finches, blackish cinclodes and Cobb&#x27;s wrens.

<doc id="579593" wikidata="Q1322692" url="?curid=579593" title="Armored Core">
<text>is a third-person shooter mecha video game series developed by FromSoftware. The series centers on a silent protagonist who takes on work as a mercenary pilot in the far future, operating large robot combat units known as Armored Cores at the behest of corporate and private clients. As the player completes missions for these clients, they gain credits to improve their Armored Core and unlock further opportunities to make money. Some games include an &quot;Arena&quot; mode in which the player fights other Armored Core pilots in head-to-head battles, which can reward the player with further income or prestige.

Several story continuities exist, spread across 13 main games, seven spin-offs, and three remastered re-releases, with different releases divided by a different set of &quot;generations&quot; of sequels that starts with every numbered entry. The first game in the series, &quot;Armored Core&quot;, was released in 1997, while the most recent, &quot;Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon&quot;, was released in 2023. The series has been released on various PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Windows and mobile phones. In 2007, the series was adapted to manga by Fujimi Shobo as &quot;Armored Core: Tower City Blade&quot;, and in 2024, to television by Tim Miller as an episode of &quot;Secret Level&quot; titled &quot;Armored Core: Asset Management&quot;, starring the voices of Keanu Reeves, Erin Yvette, Temuera Morrison, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Steve Blum.

== Premise ==
In the original continuity established by 1997&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core&quot; through 2001&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core 2: Another Age&quot;, Earth experienced a cataclysm known as the &quot;Great Destruction&quot; and humanity has been forced underground. Corporations begin fighting for dominance, leading to the increasing reliance on Armored Core pilots called Ravens. Following the events of 1999&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core: Master of Arena&quot;, humanity rebuilds and colonizes Mars. Through 2000&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core 2&quot; and its expansion, &quot;Another Age&quot;, the fledgling Earth government struggles to maintain power as opportunistic corporations exploit the power gap and rebel groups resist against the hegemony of government and business interests.

The series was rebooted with 2002&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core 3&quot;, beginning a new story arc that concluded with &quot;Armored Core: Last Raven&quot; in 2005. Following a global nuclear war, humanity has retreated underground. Following centuries of rule by an artificial intelligence called The Controller, its decay leads to the destruction of much of humanity&#x27;s underground network, causing them to look toward the surface for safety. By the end of 2003&#x27;s &quot;Silent Line: Armored Core&quot;, humanity has fully returned to the surface of Earth. The final two games of this continuity, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core: Nexus&quot; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core: Last Raven&quot; involve the end of the existing power dynamic of corporations and Ravens fighting over the surface.

2006&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core 4&quot; rebooted the series yet again. Here, corporations have seized control of Earth governments and are waging war across the surface for dominance. A war waged over the course of the game pollutes the environment, leading to the creation of floating cities in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core: For Answer&quot;. Depending on the player&#x27;s choices, humanity either barely survives the fallout of &quot;For Answer&#x27;s&quot; conflict or is completely eradicated.

The third continuity of the series continued with 2012&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core V&quot;. A single corporation has dominance over a contaminated Earth and is being opposed by a resistance faction that seeks to overthrow them. 2013&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core: Verdict Day&quot; details the outbreak of another war 100 years later following an apocalyptic event.

Another continuity has begun with 2023&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon&quot;. For the first time in the series, it takes place far away from Earth in a human-colonized star system on the planet Rubicon 3. Decades prior to the game&#x27;s start, a powerful resource called Coral was discovered, leading to significant technological advancements, but a disaster called the Fires of Ibis scorched the entire Rubicon system and left it highly contaminated. However, the Coral, thought to have all burned, has begun to reappear, bringing multiple corporations into conflict for control of it which, in turn, has brought the attention of mercenaries. Added into the conflict are the Planetary Closure Administration, an organization tasked with quarantining Rubicon, and the Rubicon Liberation Front, a resistance group who venerate the Coral, wishing to end its exploitation and free the planet.

== Gameplay ==

Within the core games of the franchise, the gameplay is generally focused on the player taking the role of a mech-piloting mercenary, taking on missions for various clients and gaining currency from completing them. Missions can involve multiple objectives and pit the player against computer controlled opponents, some of which pilot mechs as well. Upon completion of a mission, the operating costs of the mech, such as repairs and ammunition, are deducted from the total earnings of the player, as well as compensation for destroying valuable objects within the mission area. Likewise, if the player loses a mission, those same deductions occur from the player&#x27;s direct balance.

The game&#x27;s mechs, called Armored Cores (or ACs for short), are highly customizable with hundreds of parts and weapons that can be purchased from an in-game shop or by fulfilling certain requirements. Different parts can provide gameplay advantages in certain terrains or against certain enemies, which forces the player to put thought into how to approach the construction of their mech as each sortie often has different obstacles and hazards to overcome. The customization of Armored Cores is strictly limited by multiple factors such as the maximum weight load of their leg parts carrying the overall weight of every equipped part attached to it, and the energy output of their generators supplying power to all equipped parts of the AC. As such, an Armored Core&#x27;s performance varies depending on the parts that compose it, as an over-equipped AC becomes overburdened and performs slower in combat, while a lightweight AC yields faster speed and quicker responses to enemy fire at the cost of defensive and offensive counter-measures.

Many of the franchise&#x27;s games feature a branching storyline where taking on certain missions can block off others, with consequences of a player&#x27;s decision in a mission being relayed to them at the end of a mission. Certain games require multiple playthroughs to access additional contents, such as missions inaccessible during the initial playthrough, and even different endings that add additional lore and context to the games.

An Arena mode introduced in &quot;Armored Core: Project Phantasma&quot; gave players the opportunity to fight opponents outside of missions for additional rewards. &quot;Project Phantasma&quot; also introduced the import feature, allowing players to retain their progress from a previous entry when starting a new one. This import feature would become a mainstay of the franchise, with &quot;expansion&quot; titles like &quot;Silent Line: Armored Core&quot; allowing for importing saved data.

=== Multiplayer ===
Since its first release, the &quot;Armored Core&quot; games have featured multiplayer options in some form. In the original PlayStation era, local split-screen multiplayer modes were the primary method, generally featuring head-to-head battles. A PlayStation Link Cable feature, allowing for the connection of two PlayStation consoles, was included in all three original &quot;Armored Core&quot; titles.

With the PlayStation 2, split-screen and console linking continue to be the primary source of multiplayer. 2004&#x27;s &quot;Armored Core: Nexus&quot; introduced the LAN multiplayer mode, in addition to connecting through their internet service and allowed up to 4 players to fight in matches together.

Online multiplayer was first introduced in the Japanese release of &quot;Armored Core 2: Another Age&quot;, but was removed in other regions due to the PlayStation Network Adapter not being ready in time. No PlayStation 2-era game after this release would include online play either, with the first game to do so being &quot;Armored Core 4&quot;.

== Games ==
=== &quot;Armored Core&quot; ===

The original trilogy of &quot;Armored Core&quot; games were developed for the original PlayStation by FromSoftware and established many of the core themes and mechanics that would be found in the rest of the series. The debut title, &quot;Armored Core&quot;, was released on July 10, 1997, in Japan. Story elements like corporate-funded conflicts, post-apocalyptic settings, and silent protagonists were introduced in the first game. The game&#x27;s mechanics revolve around taking on missions from various clients for pay, using earned money to customize the player&#x27;s Armored Core unit.

&quot;Armored Core: Project Phantasma&quot; was released as a stand-alone expansion to the original game, released on December 4, 1997. &quot;Project Phantasma&quot; introduced an Arena mechanic that would be expanded on in later titles, as well as an import mechanic that would become an important feature through the franchise. Players were able to import save data from earlier &quot;Armored Core&quot; games and bring their existing Armored Core units into the expansions.

A second stand-alone expansion, &quot;Armored Core: Master of Arena&quot;, was released on February 4, 1999, and was the final game released for the original PlayStation. It concluded the core arc of the original &quot;Armored Core&quot; and greatly expanded on the Arena mechanic introduced in &quot;Project Phantasma&quot;. Like its predecessor, &quot;Master of Arena&quot; allowed players to import save files from both the original &quot;Armored Core&quot; and &quot;Project Phantasma&quot; to continue their progress.

All three games from the original PlayStation era were re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2007 for the tenth anniversary of the original title. The original &quot;Armored Core&quot; was also released on the Japanese PlayStation Classic in 2018.

=== &quot;Armored Core 2&quot; ===

With the transition to the PlayStation 2, FromSoftware released &quot;Armored Core 2&quot; as a launch title in Japan on August 3, 2000. As a narrative sequel to the original trilogy, &quot;Armored Core 2&quot; transitioned the series away from the post-apocalyptic setting and added more science fiction elements, such as Mars colonization. Much of the gameplay remained the same, including the mission structure, customization, and Arena modes. The title did overhaul the visuals from the original game, taking advantage of the added power of the new console, but overall designs stayed similar. Unlike &quot;Project Phantasma&quot; and &quot;Master of Arena&quot;, players could not import their saves to the new game.

&quot;Armored Core 2: Another Age&quot; was released on April 12, 2001, as a stand-alone expansion. It allowed players to import their save files from &quot;Armored Core 2&quot; and continue with their existing Armored Core units. The game introduced movement controls using the DualShock analog sticks and cooperative mission mode. The Japanese version of &quot;Armored Core 2&quot; was the first title to include online broadband play, allowing players to fight each other over the internet.

=== &quot;Armored Core 3&quot; ===

&quot;Armored Core 3&quot; was released on April 4, 2002, and served as a reboot for the franchise. The story returned to a post-apocalyptic setting and retained the core concept of corporate warfare and mercenary mission structure. Very little gameplay was changed from the earlier PlayStation 2 titles, instead focusing on incremental improvements and minor features like USB mice, computer-controlled allies, and surround sound. Due to its nature as a reboot, players could not import save data from &quot;Armored Core 2&quot; or &quot;Another Age&quot;.

A stand-alone expansion, &quot;Silent Line: Armored Core&quot;, was released on January 23, 2003, and was a direct sequel to &quot;Armored Core 3&quot;. Like other expansions in the franchise, players could import their progress from &quot;Armored Core 3&quot; into &quot;Silent Line&quot;, retaining their parts and credits from the earlier game. &quot;Silent Line&quot; introduced new gameplay mechanics, including computer-controlled companions and a first person mode.

&quot;Armored Core: Nexus&quot; was released on March 18, 2004, as a direct sequel to &quot;Silent Line&quot;. Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Nexus&quot; was treated as a core entry rather than an expansion and did not allow for save data import. While carrying over parts from &quot;3&quot; and &quot;Silent Line&quot;, mechanics changed significantly compared to past expansions. The heat mechanic introduced in &quot;Armored Core 2&quot; was made much more influential, especially with the introduction of booster heat. All part stats were also totally redistributed. The game was the first in the franchise to include support for dual analog sticks. It also introduced a new LAN multiplayer mode that allowed up to 4 players to participate in matches against each other.

&quot;Armored Core: Last Raven&quot; was released on August 4, 2005, and served as the conclusion to &quot;Armored Core 3&quot;″s story arc. The game is structured around a 24-hour clock that moves forward as missions progress. At the end of the 24-hour period, choices made by the player can alter the outcome of the plot. The game introduced a component damage system, allowing for individual parts to be broken in combat.

=== &quot;Armored Core 4&quot; ===

&quot;Armored Core 4&quot; was released on December 21, 2006, for the PlayStation 3, serving as another reboot for the franchise. An Xbox 360 version, the first instance of a main title in the franchise being released outside of the PlayStation ecosystem, was released on March 22, 2007. Gameplay in &quot;Armored Core 4&quot; has been sped up and streamlined from its predecessors in an attempt to make the game more accessible to new players. The game marks the first instance of online multiplayer outside of the Japanese release of &quot;Armored Core 2: Another Age&quot;.

&quot;Armored Core: For Answer&quot; was released on March 19, 2008, as a standalone expansion to &quot;Armored Core 4&quot;. It incorporates an online co-operative mode and a branching storyline. The game was noted for its technical problems on the PlayStation 3 version. Like &quot;Nexus&quot;, this game did not simply add content to its predecessor and changed gameplay by greatly increasing booster speeds and increasing generator performance.

=== &quot;Armored Core V&quot; ===

&quot;Armored Core V&quot; was released on January 26, 2012, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and acts as indirect sequel to &quot;Armored Core 4&quot; and &quot;Armored Core: For Answer&quot;. The game focuses on the online multiplayer component and includes far fewer offline story missions than its predecessors. In the game&#x27;s online mode, players battle for territory in teams of up to 20 players. A co-operative mode is included for players to fight NPCs alongside other players for various rewards.

&quot;Armored Core: Verdict Day&quot; was released on September 24, 2013, as a standalone expansion to &quot;Armored Core V&quot;. The game retains its predecessor&#x27;s multiplayer focus, though it allows players to create teams of AI companions instead of requiring teams composed entirely of players. A full-length story mode returns alongside a newly implemented &quot;hardcore mode&quot;, and players can import their saved games from &quot;Armored Core V&quot; to retain their personalized mechs.

=== &quot;Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon&quot; ===

&quot;Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon&quot; is another reboot of the series, unrelated to any past games, set in an alternate future where humanity has developed an interstellar civilization. The player character, codenamed &quot;C4-621&quot; is an augmented Armored Core pilot sent to the distant planet Rubicon 3 to fight in a war between corporations, the government and the local inhabitants for the control of a highly valuable resource called &quot;Coral&quot; which exists only there. The game was released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on August 25, 2023.

=== Spin-offs ===

In 2004, FromSoftware released two spin-offs from the main &quot;Armored Core&quot; series. The first, &quot;Armored Core: Nine Breaker&quot; was released on October 28, for the PlayStation 2. Removing the focus from story-based missions, the game is instead built around an Arena mode where the player must compete with computer-controlled opponents to increase their rank. Minigames designed as training exercises were included to allow players to practice specific skills. &quot;Armored Core: Formula Front&quot; was released on December 12, for the PlayStation Portable. Like &quot;Nine Breaker&quot;, its focus was on Arena-style gameplay, though a new mechanic put a focus on building an artificial intelligence strategy for the Armored Core units to execute. &quot;Formula Front&quot; was later released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan.

Several mobile games were released in the &quot;Armored Core&quot; franchise from 2004 to 2008, but they were never released outside of Japan. An American version of these mobile games was in development around 2005, but the title was never released.

== Other media ==
=== Manga ===
&quot;Armored Core: Tower City Blade&quot; is a manga by Fujimi Shobo based on the game. It was serialized in &quot;Dragon Age Pure&quot; between March 14 and April 14, 2007. A project called &quot;Armored Core: Fort Tower Song&quot; was to consist of a book and an anime also released in 2007. The book was completed but the anime was not. By 2011 FromSoftware canceled the anime project due to View Works shutting down.

=== Television ===
The series was one to appear as the focus of its own episode of Tim Miller&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Secret Level&quot; (2024), titled &quot;Armored Core: Asset Management&quot; and starring the voices of Keanu Reeves, Erin Yvette, Temuera Morrison, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Steve Blum.

== Legacy ==
The making of &quot;Armored Core&quot; solidified FromSoftware&#x27;s development skills, and in July 1999, they released the multiplayer action game &quot;Frame Gride&quot; for the Sega Dreamcast. The company&#x27;s focus would shift from RPGs to mech games due in part to the success of the &quot;Armored Core&quot; series. In 2002, FromSoftware released the mech action game &quot;&quot; for the Xbox. In 2004, they released another Xbox title, &quot;Metal Wolf Chaos&quot;. In 2005, FromSoftware would start to produce a series of licensed games based on the various anime properties under the banner &quot;Another Century&#x27;s Episode&quot;. Kenichiro Tsukuda, the producer of the &quot;Armored Core&quot; series produced a similar video game called &quot;Daemon X Machina&quot; that was released for the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows.

Many of &quot;Armored Core&quot;&#x27;s core gameplay philosophies, namely its open-ended customization options that affect gameplay, the necessity of mastering its cumbersome control scheme to succeed, large-scale battles requiring trial-and-error gameplay loop, and its deep yet vague lore scattered throughout, have since been an integral appeal of the Soulslike genre of videogames, as seen later with &quot;FromSoftware&quot;&#x27;s more popular titles such as &quot;Demon Souls&quot;, the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; trilogy, &quot;Bloodborne&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Elden Ring&quot;.

<text>Speedwell Island (formerly Eagle Island; Spanish &quot;Isla Águila&quot;) is one of the Falkland Islands, lying in the Falkland Sound, southwest of Lafonia, East Falkland.

The island has an area of , measuring approximately from north to south and across at its widest central part. It is generally low-lying with some permanent ponds. It is separated from Lafonia by the Eagle Passage, which retains Speedwell Island&#x27;s former name. It is the largest of the Speedwell Island group, which includes the Elephant Cays, George Island, Barren Island, and Annie Island.

==Ecology==
One of the largest rodent-free islands in the Falklands, Speedwell Island has a thriving population of native songbirds, seabirds, and penguins. In total, more than 40 species of birds have been recorded on the island. The breeding colony of South American sea lions in Speedwell Pass produces about 90 pups annually, and the animals haul out on most of the group&#x27;s islands, including Speedwell Island itself. The island has also been operated as a sheep farm for more than a century, leading to serious soil erosion in coastal areas due to overgrazing.

==History==

===&quot;Isabella&quot;===
On 8 February 1813 the &quot;Isabella&quot;, a British ship of 193 tons en route from Sydney to London, ran aground off the coast of Speedwell Island, then known as Eagle Island. Among the ship&#x27;s 54 passengers and crew, all of whom survived the wreck, was the United Irish general and exile Joseph Holt, who subsequently detailed the ordeal in his memoirs. Also aboard had been the heavily pregnant Joanna Durie, who on 21 Feb 1813 gave birth to Elizabeth Providence Durie.

The next day, 22 February 1813, six men who had volunteered to seek help from any nearby Spanish outposts that they could find set out in one of the Isabella&#x27;s longboats. Braving the South Atlantic in a boat little more than , they made landfall on the mainland at the River Plate just over a month later. The British gun brig under the command of Lieutenant William D&#x27;Aranda was sent to rescue the survivors.

On 5 April Captain Charles Barnard of the American sealer &quot;Nanina&quot; was sailing off the shore of Speedwell Island, with a discovery boat deployed looking for seals. Having seen smoke and heard gunshots the previous day, he was alert to the possibility of survivors of a ship wreck. This suspicion was heightened when the crew of the boat came aboard and informed Barnard that they had come across a new moccasin as well as the partially butchered remains of a seal. At dinner that evening, the crew observed a man approaching the ship who was shortly joined by eight to ten others. Both Barnard and the survivors from the &quot;Isabella&quot; had harboured concerns the other party was Spanish and were relieved to discover their respective nationalities.

Barnard dined with the &quot;Isabella&quot; survivors that evening and finding that the British party were unaware of the War of 1812 informed the survivors that technically they were at war with each other. Nevertheless, Barnard promised to rescue the British party and set about preparations for the voyage to the River Plate. Realising that they had insufficient stores for the voyage he set about hunting wild pigs and otherwise acquiring additional food. While Barnard was gathering supplies, however, the British took the opportunity to seize the &quot;Nanina&quot; and departed leaving Barnard, along with one member of his own crew and three from the &quot;Isabella&quot;, marooned. Shortly thereafter, the &quot;Nancy&quot; arrived from the River Plate and encountered the &quot;Nanina&quot;, whereupon Lieutenant D&#x27;Aranda rescued the erstwhile survivors of the &quot;Isabella&quot; and took the &quot;Nanina&quot; itself as a prize of war.

Barnard and his party survived for eighteen months marooned on the islands until the British whalers &quot;Indispensable&quot; and &quot;Asp&quot; rescued them in November 1814. The British admiral in Rio de Janeiro had requested their masters to divert to the area to search for the American crew. In 1829, Barnard published an account of his survival entitled &quot;A Narrative of the Sufferings and Adventures of Capt Charles H. Barnard&quot;.

===Later history===
The 1837 survey of the Falkland Islands by under the command of Lieutenant Robert Lowcay noted that there were wild pigs on the island.

In 1929 Alexander Dugas, a Frenchman employed on Sealion Island, committed suicide, and his companions felt it necessary to inform the authorities. The lack of a harbour on Sealion Island meant, however, that no boat of any size could be kept on the island, and so a determined individual named Benny Davis constructed a makeshift craft from wooden barrels and launched it into the surf. Davis set out just before dark, and reached Speedwell Island, almost 30 miles distant, some twelve hours later. He explained that he had simply headed west until he could smell the cormorants on nearby Annie Island.

==Important Bird Area==
The Speedwell Island group (excluding the Elephant Cays, which form a separate IBA) has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include blackish cinclodes, Cobb&#x27;s wrens, dolphin gulls (500 breeding pairs), Falkland steamer ducks (600 pairs), Magellanic penguins (10,000 pairs), ruddy-headed geese, sooty shearwaters, southern giant petrels (1,000 pairs), striated caracaras, and white-bridled finches.

<text>Mr. Belvedere is an American sitcom that originally aired on ABC from March 15, 1985 until its cancellation following the 107th episode on December 30, 1989. The network then shelved the remainder of season six. Seven months later, ABC aired the show&#x27;s two-part series finale on Sunday, July 8, 1990; a rare occurrence for a cancelled program. The eight remaining episodes from season six that the network shelved (bringing the final number of episodes to 117) would eventually air in syndication. The series is based on the Lynn Aloysius Belvedere character created by Gwen Davenport for her 1947 novel &quot;Belvedere&quot;, which was later adapted into the 1948 film &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;. The show stars Christopher Hewett as the title character, a butler for an American family headed by George Owens, played by Bob Uecker.

==Premise==
The series follows posh English butler Lynn Belvedere as he struggles to adapt to the Owens household in suburban Pittsburgh. The breadwinner, George (Bob Uecker), is a sportswriter (in the pilot he worked in construction). His wife Marsha (Ilene Graff) is attending law school. At the show&#x27;s start, older son Kevin (Rob Stone) is a senior in high school, daughter Heather (Tracy Wells) is a freshman, and Wesley (Brice Beckham) is in elementary school.

Over the course of the series, George becomes a sportscaster (a career shared with Uecker, who balanced his role as the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Milwaukee Brewers while starring in the series), Marsha graduates from law school and starts a career as a lawyer, Kevin leaves for college and gets his own apartment, Heather moves up in high school, and Wesley moves up to junior high.

Several episodes deal with the relationship between Wesley and Mr. Belvedere, who are always at odds with each other, with Wesley constantly antagonizing Belvedere (similar to Dennis the Menace and Mr. Wilson). Deep down, they are revealed to really love each other. Belvedere is the only one who can tame Wesley.

In season two&#x27;s &quot;Wesley&#x27;s Friend&quot; – one of the series&#x27; many very special episodes – Danny, one of Wesley&#x27;s classmates, contracts HIV via factor VIII treatment for hemophilia (the same way Ryan White contracted HIV). Danny is taken out of school due to the ignorance and uncertainty shared by the parents of many of the other children at Wesley&#x27;s school. After hearing rumors from his friends about how HIV can be spread, leading them to shun him for spending time with Danny, Wesley begins to avoid Danny in fear of getting the disease himself. Mr. Belvedere is there for him and the child, and he helps Wesley shed his fear of the boy and publicly accept him as his friend.

Throughout the series, Mr. Belvedere serves as a mentor of sorts to Wesley as well as to the other children. Being a cultured man with many skills and achievements (having even once worked for Winston Churchill), he also comes to serve as a &quot;counselor&quot; to the Owens clan, helping them solve their dilemmas and stay out of mischief. Each episode, except &quot;Deportation Part 1&quot; (season three) and &quot;The Counselor&quot; (season four) ends with Mr. Belvedere writing in his journal, recounting the events of the day (which is heard by the audience via his narration) with the Owens family and what he gets out of it in terms of a lesson.

A frequent gag on the show involves Heather&#x27;s air-headed best friend Angela (Michele Matheson), who almost always mispronounces Mr. Belvedere&#x27;s name (such as calling him &quot;Mr. Bumpersticker&quot;, &quot;Mr. Bellpepper&quot;, &quot;Mr. Butterfinger&quot; or &quot;Mr. Velveeta&quot;).

Belvedere&#x27;s penchant for junk food is shown in many episodes, often being playfully mocked by other characters. Another frequent gag involves George and Mr. Belvedere butting heads, with George being annoyed with his &quot;nosy English housekeeper&quot; always interfering. Yet another recurring gag features George always trying to be initiated into a local charity club, the &quot;Happy Guys of Pittsburgh&quot;. Wesley&#x27;s highly acrimonious relationship with the never-seen next-door neighbors, the Hufnagels (whose first names all began with the letter H), and the shenanigans he pulls on them is another recurring plot element. At the end of the episode where Mr. Belvedere writes his journal about the experiences and adventures that he learns at the end of the episode.

==Production==
===Development===
The character of Lynn Belvedere was originally created by Gwen Leys Davenport in her 1947 novel &quot;Belvedere&quot;. The following year, the title character was portrayed by Clifton Webb in the film &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;, which told the story of an arrogant genius who answers an employment advertisement for a babysitter for three bratty kids. He accepts the job because he is secretly writing a novel about a community of gossips and busybodies. Webb earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance and reprised the role in two other films, &quot;Mr. Belvedere Goes to College&quot; (1949) and &quot;Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell&quot; (1951).

Three previous attempts were unsuccessfully made to adapt the character to television: in 1956 with Reginald Gardiner, in 1959 with Hans Conried and in 1965 with Victor Buono. In 1985, ABC aired &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; as a mid-season replacement, with British actor Christopher Hewett playing Lynn Belvedere.

===Pre-production===
The series&#x27; co-creators and executive producers, Frank Dungan and Jeff Stein, pitched the series as &quot;a very elegant, very British sophisticate hired to restore order to a chaotic household in a Pittsburgh suburb.&quot; The show eventually featured an upper-middle-class family in a highly fictionalized version of the real Pittsburgh suburb of Beaver Falls. According to Dungan and Stein, Pittsburgh was chosen as the show&#x27;s setting because &quot;it was either Pittsburgh or Paris, and Paris doesn&#x27;t have the Penguins... we wanted someplace with seasons and sporting activity... A city kinda going through a resurgence... with character and traditions that is moving into the &#x27;80s, a blue-collar community that is moving into the up-and-coming, yet with the traditional spirit of the country. From everything we&#x27;ve read, Pittsburgh is moving into high tech.&quot;

Weeks after Pittsburgh was chosen as the show&#x27;s setting, the city was named by Rand-McNally as the most livable in the U.S. The show&#x27;s producers promised to use this publicity. Both Dungan (from Philadelphia) and Stein (from Cleveland) admitted to never having been to Pittsburgh prior to developing the series, although Dungan&#x27;s sister attended Carnegie Mellon University and had told him about the city&#x27;s resurgence. Stein admitted: &quot;We thought about setting the show in Cleveland, but that&#x27;s too jokey. ... We&#x27;re not doing Pittsburgh jokes. We like Pittsburgh. We like the Pittsburgh Steelers. That&#x27;s a classy ballclub. And we like Willie Stargell.&quot; No scenes from the pilot nor the first season&#x27;s six episodes were shot on location, but the producers promised that &quot;if we get picked up for fall [1985–86], we&#x27;ll probably come to Pittsburgh.&quot;

The producers learned of Pittsburgh locales from a promotional calendar provided by the Pittsburgh Media Group (PMG), a consortium of public officials and Western Pennsylvania media. Dungan and Stein used it for story ideas during Season 1 after the PMG pitched several studio groups in Los Angeles in January 1985: &quot;The calendar has Pittsburgh scenes for each month. The Bridge of Sighs is February. The PPG Building is March. Three Rivers Stadium gets three months.&quot;

==Episodes==
==Theme song and opening sequence==
The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;According to Our New Arrival&quot;, was performed by ragtime singer Leon Redbone. It was written by Judy Hart-Angelo and Gary Portnoy, who also co-wrote the theme songs to &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;. In the original unaired pilot, an unidentified studio vocalist sang the theme.

The song was composed in 1984 for a rejected television pilot called &quot;Help&quot; (which was later resurrected in 1987 as &quot;Marblehead Manor&quot;, produced by Paramount Television and aired in first-run syndication). With a minor lyrical rewrite (changing the word &quot;&quot;arrivals&quot; to &quot;arrival&quot;&quot;), it quickly became the theme song to &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;. In 2007, Portnoy released a never-before-heard full-length version of the theme on his CD, &quot;Destiny&quot;.

The show used four different closing themes during its original run:
# The unaired Pilot and early ABC promos of the show used a rock version of the main theme, with a guitar lead.
# Seasons 1 and 2 and one Season 3 episode featured an instrumental version of the theme song.
# Season 3 featured a Dixieland rendition of the ending theme.
# Seasons 4-6 employed a jazzier rendition of the ending theme.

===Opening credits===
====First version (pilot)====
This sequence consisted of a purple family portrait book, with pictures of the cast (including a picture of George at his construction job), set to the original version of theme song. This version was only used on the original unaired version of the pilot; the broadcast version used the second variation. It surfaced on Antenna TV in 2015.

====Second version (season one)====
Similar to the original unaired pilot, but now with a beige family portrait book, some of the cast pictures changed (most notably, George at his construction job), and Leon Redbone singing the theme. The Redbone version would be used in all subsequent variations of the opening. On the Shout! Factory DVDs of seasons one &amp; two, this was only seen on the broadcast version of the pilot.

====Third version (season two)====
The opening was overhauled completely beginning with this season. It begins with a stock photo of a British palace, and then zooms in to Mr. Belvedere himself. It was then followed by Belvedere as different people (including a Man on Safari), followed by photos and clips from season one episodes, as well as general photos of the cast from said season. On the Shout! Factory DVDs of seasons one &amp; two, this version was kept as is on all the season two episodes, but plastered the season one opening on episodes 2–7. In addition, the show adopted its familiar logo.

====Fourth version (seasons three through six)====
The opening was overhauled completely once more in season three. Now, it began with Mr. Belvedere writing in his journal, followed by the camera zooming in to the fictional World Focus magazine, with Belvedere on the front cover for the title card. It was then followed by edited images of Belvedere with famous people from around the world. The photos were updated to reflect how the cast looked in season three, and most of the season one clips were now replaced with scenes from season two episodes. In season four, the opening was updated to feature new positions of Tracy Wells on the couch. In season six, it was updated once more to feature clips from season five episodes, and new positions of Brice Beckham on the couch. A short 30 second version was also created, as well. In early syndication reruns, the short season four/five opening was used on all the episodes, with the exception of season six; early reruns of season six used the short open from said season.

==Ratings and cancellation==
&quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; did not place within Nielsen&#x27;s Top 30 shows at any time during its six-season run, but it did have a relatively solid ratings base, and often won its time slot.

Its first season (1985) was exempt from the Nielsen ratings as it aired too few episodes before the end of April to be counted. In its second season (1985–86), the series ranked at #45 with a 14.8 rating.

During season three (1986–87), the show fell to 51st place with a 13.7 rating. At the end of the 1986–87 season, ABC decided to cancel the show after three seasons, but negative feedback from fans of the series led the network to reverse its decision and order a fourth season that debuted in October 1987. In season four (1987–88), the show fell to 64th place and an 11.5 rating for the year. For its fifth season (1988–89), the show rose to a 12.2 rating, placing it at #47 for the season.

For its sixth and final season (1989–90), &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; left its longtime Friday night slot (which began its evolution into the long-running TGIF block that season) and was moved to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday nights. The move led &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; to suffer a steep ratings decline, falling to a 6.3 rating. The final episode to air before it was put on hiatus on December 30, 1989 ranked #70 out of 83 shows. ABC canceled the series for good in February 1990. The two-part finale, which aired on July 1 and July 8, 1990, ranked #59 and #37, respectively, out of the 86 shows that aired during those weeks.

==Syndication==
In addition to its existing prime time airings, ABC aired reruns of the first three seasons of &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; on the network&#x27;s daily daytime schedule from September 7, 1987 to January 15, 1988, filling the gap between the cancellation of the game show &quot;Bargain Hunters&quot; and the premiere of the talk show &quot;Home&quot;.

On September 11, 1989 (about the time the show entered its final season), and continuing in sporadically until 1997, it was seen in local syndication on select Fox affiliates. Along with the addition of seasons four through six, ten previously unaired episodes (two from season five and eight from season six), were also added to the syndication package. The syndication package initially consisted of all 95 half-hour episodes produced up until the end of season five in 1989; the following year, season six (the remaining 22 half-hour episodes) was finally included in the package.

In the early 2000s, reruns of the series aired on Foxnet (a master feed of the Fox network for markets without a local affiliate, which aired syndicated programs outside of network programming), and on CTS in Canada from 2002 to 2004.

In December 2009, American Life Network aired both of the series&#x27; Christmas-themed episodes, as part of the network&#x27;s month-long block of holiday-centered episodes of series from 20th Century Fox Television (season four&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Story&quot; and season six&#x27;s &quot;A Happy Guy&#x27;s Christmas&quot;). This was the first time in over a decade that &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; was syndicated in U.S. On or around October 3, 2011, reruns began airing on FamilyNet, marking the first time that the series had been regularly syndicated in over 15 years. Around November 2012, Dish Network began broadcasting FamilyNet&#x27;s successor channel, Rural TV, making the show viewable throughout the U.S. on weeknights (with commercial bumpers intact briefly). On January 5, 2015, Antenna TV began airing reruns of the series, initially airing seven days a week. These have been completely unedited, and include alternate pilot credits without Leon Redbone singing. It aired until April 1, 2018.

==Home media==
Shout! Factory (under license from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) has released the first four seasons of &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; on DVD in Region 1, featuring the original unedited prints of the episodes. Currently, Shout! Factory does not have the DVD rights to seasons five and six, and has been involved in protracted negotiations to acquire those remaining episodes (46 in total) for future releases.

In September 2015, Shout! re-released season 4 on DVD as a full retail release.
