<text>The Senior Bowl is a post-season college football all-star game played annually in late January or early February in Mobile, Alabama, which showcases the best NFL Draft prospects of those players who have completed their college eligibility. Produced by the non-profit Mobile Arts &amp; Sports Association, the game is also a charitable fund-raiser, benefiting various local and regional organizations with over US$7.8 million in donations over its history. The game is sponsored by Reese&#x27;s, a brand of The Hershey Company, and is televised by the NFL Network.

==History==
The 1950 Senior Bowl, the inaugural edition, was played at Gator Bowl Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida; the game then moved to Mobile&#x27;s Ladd–Peebles Stadium the next year, where it remained through the 2020 edition. Starting with the 2021 edition, the game is played at Hancock Whitney Stadium on the campus of the University of South Alabama, also in Mobile.

Historically, the Senior Bowl was the first chance its participants had to openly receive pay for participation in an athletic event. Players in the inaugural 1950 game each received $343 (if on the losing team) or $475 (if on the winning team); by 1975, the amounts had been increased to $1,250 and $1,500. The 1988 edition was the last time players were paid ($1,500 and $1,750). This was one reason that participation was limited to seniors whose eligibility for further participation in college football had expired. Athletes who wished to play spring collegiate sports, such as college baseball, or otherwise remain eligible for amateur sports, had to avoid participation in the Senior Bowl.

The game has consistently been played on a Saturday in January, with the exception of 1976, when it was held on a Sunday. The scheduling date within January has varied – the earliest playing has been January 3 (1953 and 1959), while the latest playing prior to the 2022 edition has been January 30 (2010 and 2016). Since 1967, it has been traditionally set for the week before the NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl (which itself is now played in February). It is usually scheduled as the final game of the college football season, although for a period during the 1980s and 1990s, it was the next-to-the-last game, followed a week later by either the Hula Bowl or the Gridiron Classic. From 2007 through 2011, and also in 2013, the Senior Bowl was again the penultimate game, followed by the Texas vs The Nation game a week later. In 2020, the revived Hula Bowl was played the day after the Senior Bowl.

CBS acquired national television coverage rights to the 1952 through 1954 games, though they never televised the games nationally under those rights. The first nationally televised Senior Bowl was in 1958 by NBC, and the games have been televised every year since. To commemorate the occasion and the publicity that the televising of the Senior Bowl would draw to the state of Alabama, Gov. James E. Folsom commissioned each player in the 1958 game as Honorary Admirals in the Alabama State Navy, as well as Senior Bowl founder Jimmy Pearre, North squad coach Joe Kuharich, South squad coach Paul Brown, and South squad past-coach Steve Owens; announcers for the televised event, Red Grange and Lindsey Nelson, were commissioned Honorary Colonels in the Alabama State Militia. ESPN televised the game as early as 1982, continuing until the game moved to the NFL Network starting with the 2007 edition.

Sponsors of the game have included Delchamps, a supermarket chain headquartered in Mobile; Food World, a supermarket chain headquartered in Birmingham; Under Armour; and Nike, Inc. Starting with the 2014 game, Reese&#x27;s took over sponsorship. In January 2018, Reese&#x27;s announced that they were extending their sponsorship of the game through at least the 2020 edition.

In March 2020, the Senior Bowl registered &quot;The draft starts in Mobile&quot; as a service mark. In October 2020, Panini America entered a multi-year agreement to produce trading cards for Senior Bowl players.

==Game format==
For most editions of the Senior Bowl, players have been rostered into North and South teams. In 1991, team names were changed to AFC and NFC, to distinguish where their coaching staffs were from and to stress the professional nature of the game. This was somewhat confusing, as the Senior Bowl is played early in the calendar year, typically several months before players are selected by teams in the NFL draft. Additionally, both coaching staffs for the 1993 game came from AFC teams. In 1994, team designations were reverted to the North vs. South format. In 2021, the bowl moved to American and National team designations.

The two teams are coached by coaching staffs that are selected from two NFL teams. In recent years, the coaching staffs have come from teams who finished near the bottom of the league standings, but whose coaches were not subsequently terminated. Beginning with the 2022 edition, head coaches serve in more of an advisory capacity while promoting select assistants into leadership roles on the staff.

Organizers stipulate a number of specific rules for the game, some of which are intended to reduce the chance of injury (e.g. &quot;All blocks below the waist are prohibited&quot;), and others that simplify what the teams need to practice and prepare for (e.g. &quot;Only four rushers allowed, no 5-man pressures or blitzes from secondary permitted&quot;). The game is also the players&#x27; first time competing under the slightly different professional rules (e.g. receivers must have both feet inbounds for a legal catch vs. just one foot inbounds in college football).

The week-long practice that precedes the game is attended by key NFL personnel (including coaches, general managers and scouts), who oversee the players as possible prospects for professional football. Athletes sometimes decline invitations to participate in the Senior Bowl, opting instead to prepare for the NFL scouting combine or their college&#x27;s pro day.

The single-season record for number of players sent to the Senior Bowl from one school is 10 by Alabama in 1987, followed by nine sent by Auburn in 1988 and USC in 2008.

Dan Lynch of Washington State was the first (and to date only) player to appear in two Senior Bowls (1984 and 1985), having been granted an extra year of eligibility after the 1984 game. In 2013, two players (D. J. Fluker and Justin Pugh) with a year of college football eligibility remaining, but who had already graduated, became the first &quot;fourth-year juniors&quot; to be granted clearance to play in the Senior Bowl.

<text>In the fields of medicine, biotechnology, and pharmacology, drug discovery is the process by which new candidate medications are discovered.

Historically, drugs were discovered by identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery, as with penicillin. More recently, chemical libraries of synthetic small molecules, natural products, or extracts were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that had a desirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology. After sequencing of the human genome allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use high throughput screening of large compounds libraries against isolated biological targets which are hypothesized to be disease-modifying in a process known as reverse pharmacology. Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for efficacy.

Modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits, medicinal chemistry, and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity, selectivity (to reduce the potential of side effects), efficacy/potency, metabolic stability (to increase the half-life), and oral bioavailability. Once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified, the process of drug development can continue. If successful, clinical trials are developed.

Modern drug discovery is thus usually a capital-intensive process that involves large investments by pharmaceutical industry corporations as well as national governments (who provide grants and loan guarantees). Despite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, &quot;expensive, difficult, and inefficient process&quot; with low rate of new therapeutic discovery. In 2010, the research and development cost of each new molecular entity was about US$1.8 billion. In the 21st century, basic discovery research is funded primarily by governments and by philanthropic organizations, while late-stage development is funded primarily by pharmaceutical companies or venture capitalists. To be allowed to come to market, drugs must undergo several successful phases of clinical trials, and pass through a new drug approval process, called the New Drug Application in the United States.

Discovering drugs that may be a commercial success, or a public health success, involves a complex interaction between investors, industry, academia, patent laws, regulatory exclusivity, marketing, and the need to balance secrecy with communication. Meanwhile, for disorders whose rarity means that no large commercial success or public health effect can be expected, the orphan drug funding process ensures that people who experience those disorders can have some hope of pharmacotherapeutic advances.

==History==

The idea that the effect of a drug in the human body is mediated by specific interactions of the drug molecule with biological macromolecules, (proteins or nucleic acids in most cases) led scientists to the conclusion that individual chemicals are required for the biological activity of the drug. This made for the beginning of the modern era in pharmacology, as pure chemicals, instead of crude extracts of medicinal plants, became the standard drugs. Examples of drug compounds isolated from crude preparations are morphine, the active agent in opium, and digoxin, a heart stimulant originating from &quot;Digitalis lanata&quot;. Organic chemistry also led to the synthesis of many of the natural products isolated from biological sources.

Historically, substances, whether crude extracts or purified chemicals, were screened for biological activity without knowledge of the biological target. Only after an active substance was identified was an effort made to identify the target. This approach is known as classical pharmacology, forward pharmacology, or phenotypic drug discovery.

Later, small molecules were synthesized to specifically target a known physiological/pathological pathway, avoiding the mass screening of banks of stored compounds. This led to great success, such as the work of Gertrude Elion and George H. Hitchings on purine metabolism, the work of James Black on beta blockers and cimetidine, and the discovery of statins by Akira Endo. Another champion of the approach of developing chemical analogues of known active substances was Sir David Jack at Allen and Hanbury&#x27;s, later Glaxo, who pioneered the first inhaled selective beta2-adrenergic agonist for asthma, the first inhaled steroid for asthma, ranitidine as a successor to cimetidine, and supported the development of the triptans.

Gertrude Elion, working mostly with a group of fewer than 50 people on purine analogues, contributed to the discovery of the first anti-viral; the first immunosuppressant (azathioprine) that allowed human organ transplantation; the first drug to induce remission of childhood leukemia; pivotal anti-cancer treatments; an anti-malarial; an anti-bacterial; and a treatment for gout.

Cloning of human proteins made possible the screening of large libraries of compounds against specific targets thought to be linked to specific diseases. This approach is known as reverse pharmacology and is the most frequently used approach today.

In the 2020s, qubit and quantum computing started to be used to reduce the time needed to drug discovery.

== Targets ==

A &quot;target&quot; is produced within the pharmaceutical industry. Generally, the &quot;target&quot; is the naturally existing cellular or molecular structure involved in the pathology of interest where the drug-in-development is meant to act. However, the distinction between a &quot;new&quot; and &quot;established&quot; target can be made without a full understanding of just what a &quot;target&quot; is. This distinction is typically made by pharmaceutical companies engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutics. In an estimate from 2011, 435 human genome products were identified as therapeutic drug targets of FDA-approved drugs.

&quot;Established targets&quot; are those for which there is a good scientific understanding, supported by a lengthy publication history, of both how the target functions in normal physiology and how it is involved in human pathology. This does not imply that the mechanism of action of drugs that are thought to act through a particular established target is fully understood. Rather, &quot;established&quot; relates directly to the amount of background information available on a target, in particular functional information. In general, &quot;new targets&quot; are all those targets that are not &quot;established targets&quot; but which have been or are the subject of drug discovery efforts. The majority of targets selected for drug discovery efforts are proteins, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and protein kinases.

==Screening and design==

The process of finding a new drug against a chosen target for a particular disease usually involves high-throughput screening (HTS), wherein large libraries of chemicals are tested for their ability to modify the target. For example, if the target is a novel GPCR, compounds will be screened for their ability to inhibit or stimulate that receptor (see antagonist and agonist): if the target is a protein kinase, the chemicals will be tested for their ability to inhibit that kinase.

Another function of HTS is to show how selective the compounds are for the chosen target, as one wants to find a molecule which will interfere with only the chosen target, but not other, related targets. To this end, other screening runs will be made to see whether the &quot;hits&quot; against the chosen target will interfere with other related targets – this is the process of cross-screening. Cross-screening is useful because the more unrelated targets a compound hits, the more likely that off-target toxicity will occur with that compound once it reaches the clinic.

It is unlikely that a perfect drug candidate will emerge from these early screening runs. One of the first steps is to screen for compounds that are unlikely to be developed into drugs; for example compounds that are hits in almost every assay, classified by medicinal chemists as &quot;pan-assay interference compounds&quot;, are removed at this stage, if they were not already removed from the chemical library. It is often observed that several compounds are found to have some degree of activity, and if these compounds share common chemical features, one or more pharmacophores can then be developed. At this point, medicinal chemists will attempt to use structure–activity relationships (SAR) to improve certain features of the lead compound:
* increase activity against the chosen target
* reduce activity against unrelated targets
* improve the druglikeness or ADME properties of the molecule.

This process will require several iterative screening runs, during which, it is hoped, the properties of the new molecular entities will improve, and allow the favoured compounds to go forward to in vitro and in vivo testing for activity in the disease model of choice.

Amongst the physicochemical properties associated with drug absorption include ionization (pKa), and solubility; permeability can be determined by PAMPA and Caco-2. PAMPA is attractive as an early screen due to the low consumption of drug and the low cost compared to tests such as Caco-2, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and Blood–brain barrier (BBB) with which there is a high correlation.

A range of parameters can be used to assess the quality of a compound, or a series of compounds, as proposed in the Lipinski&#x27;s Rule of Five. Such parameters include calculated properties such as cLogP to estimate lipophilicity, molecular weight, polar surface area and measured properties, such as potency, in-vitro measurement of enzymatic clearance etc. Some descriptors such as ligand efficiency (LE) and lipophilic efficiency (LiPE) combine such parameters to assess druglikeness.

While HTS is a commonly used method for novel drug discovery, it is not the only method. It is often possible to start from a molecule which already has some of the desired properties. Such a molecule might be extracted from a natural product or even be a drug on the market which could be improved upon (so-called &quot;me too&quot; drugs). Other methods, such as virtual high throughput screening, where screening is done using computer-generated models and attempting to &quot;dock&quot; virtual libraries to a target, are also often used.

Another method for drug discovery is &quot;de novo&quot; drug design, in which a prediction is made of the sorts of chemicals that might (e.g.) fit into an active site of the target enzyme. For example, virtual screening and computer-aided drug design are often used to identify new chemical moieties that may interact with a target protein. Molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations can be used as a guide to improve the potency and properties of new drug leads.

There is also a paradigm shift in the drug discovery community to shift away from HTS, which is expensive and may only cover limited chemical space, to the screening of smaller libraries (maximum a few thousand compounds). These include fragment-based lead discovery (FBDD) and protein-directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry. The ligands in these approaches are usually much smaller, and they bind to the target protein with weaker binding affinity than hits that are identified from HTS. Further modifications through organic synthesis into lead compounds are often required. Such modifications are often guided by protein X-ray crystallography of the protein-fragment complex. The advantages of these approaches are that they allow more efficient screening and the compound library, although small, typically covers a large chemical space when compared to HTS.

Phenotypic screens have also provided new chemical starting points in drug discovery.  A variety of models have been used including yeast, zebrafish, worms, immortalized cell lines, primary cell lines, patient-derived cell lines and whole animal models. These screens are designed to find compounds which reverse a disease phenotype such as death, protein aggregation, mutant protein expression, or cell proliferation as examples in a more holistic cell model or organism. Smaller screening sets are often used for these screens, especially when the models are expensive or time-consuming to run.  In many cases, the exact mechanism of action of hits from these screens is unknown and may require extensive target deconvolution experiments to ascertain. The growth of the field of chemoproteomics has provided numerous strategies to identify drug targets in these cases.

Once a lead compound series has been established with sufficient target potency and selectivity and favourable drug-like properties, one or two compounds will then be proposed for drug development. The best of these is generally called the lead compound, while the other will be designated as the &quot;backup&quot;. These decisions are generally supported by computational modelling innovations.
==Nature as source==

Traditionally, many drugs and other chemicals with biological activity have been discovered by studying chemicals that organisms create to affect the activity of other organisms for survival.

Despite the rise of combinatorial chemistry as an integral part of lead discovery process, natural products still play a major role as starting material for drug discovery. A 2007 report found that of the 974 small molecule new chemical entities developed between 1981 and 2006, 63% were natural derived or semisynthetic derivatives of natural products. For certain therapy areas, such as antimicrobials, antineoplastics, antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory drugs, the numbers were higher.

Natural products may be useful as a source of novel chemical structures for modern techniques of development of antibacterial therapies.

=== Plant-derived ===

Many secondary metabolites produced by plants have potential therapeutic medicinal properties. These secondary metabolites contain, bind to, and modify the function of proteins (receptors, enzymes, etc.). Consequently, plant derived natural products have often been used as the starting point for drug discovery.

====History====

Until the Renaissance, the vast majority of drugs in Western medicine were plant-derived extracts. This has resulted in a pool of information about the potential of plant species as important sources of starting materials for drug discovery. Botanical knowledge about different metabolites and hormones that are produced in different anatomical parts of the plant (e.g. roots, leaves, and flowers) are crucial for correctly identifying bioactive and pharmacological plant properties. Identifying new drugs and getting them approved for market has proved to be a stringent process due to regulations set by national drug regulatory agencies.

==== Jasmonates ====
 Jasmonates are important in responses to injury and intracellular signals. They induce apoptosis and protein cascade via proteinase inhibitor, have defense functions, and regulate plant responses to different biotic and abiotic stresses. Jasmonates also have the ability to directly act on mitochondrial membranes by inducing membrane depolarization via release of metabolites.

Jasmonate derivatives (JAD) are also important in wound response and tissue regeneration in plant cells. They have also been identified to have anti-aging effects on human epidermal layer. It is suspected that they interact with proteoglycans (PG) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides, which are essential extracellular matrix (ECM) components to help remodel the ECM. The discovery of JADs on skin repair has introduced newfound interest in the effects of these plant hormones in therapeutic medicinal application.

==== Salicylates ====

Salicylic acid (SA), a phytohormone, was initially derived from willow bark and has since been identified in many species. It is an important player in plant immunity, although its role is still not fully understood by scientists. They are involved in disease and immunity responses in plant and animal tissues. They have salicylic acid binding proteins (SABPs) that have shown to affect multiple animal tissues. The first discovered medicinal properties of the isolated compound was involved in pain and fever management. They also play an active role in the suppression of cell proliferation. They have the ability to induce death in lymphoblastic leukemia and other human cancer cells. One of the most common drugs derived from salicylates is aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, with anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic properties.

=== Animal-derived ===
Some drugs used in modern medicine have been discovered in animals or are based on compounds found in animals. For example, the anticoagulant drugs, hirudin and its synthetic congener, bivalirudin, are based on saliva chemistry of the leech, &quot;Hirudo medicinalis&quot;. Used to treat type 2 diabetes, exenatide was developed from saliva compounds of the Gila monster, a venomous lizard.

=== Microbial metabolites ===

Microbes compete for living space and nutrients. To survive in these conditions, many microbes have developed abilities to prevent competing species from proliferating. Microbes are the main source of antimicrobial drugs. Streptomyces isolates have been such a valuable source of antibiotics, that they have been called medicinal molds. The classic example of an antibiotic discovered as a defense mechanism against another microbe is penicillin in bacterial cultures contaminated by &quot;Penicillium&quot; fungi in 1928.

=== Marine invertebrates ===

Marine environments are potential sources for new bioactive agents. Arabinose nucleosides discovered from marine invertebrates in 1950s, demonstrated for the first time that sugar moieties other than ribose and deoxyribose can yield bioactive nucleoside structures. It took until 2004 when the first marine-derived drug was approved. For example, the cone snail toxin ziconotide, also known as Prialt treats severe neuropathic pain. Several other marine-derived agents are now in clinical trials for indications such as cancer, anti-inflammatory use and pain. One class of these agents are bryostatin-like compounds, under investigation as anti-cancer therapy.

=== Chemical diversity ===
As above mentioned, combinatorial chemistry was a key technology enabling the efficient generation of large screening libraries for the needs of high-throughput screening. However, now, after two decades of combinatorial chemistry, it has been pointed out that despite the increased efficiency in chemical synthesis, no increase in lead or drug candidates has been reached. This has led to analysis of chemical characteristics of combinatorial chemistry products, compared to existing drugs or natural products. The chemoinformatics concept chemical diversity, depicted as distribution of compounds in the chemical space based on their physicochemical characteristics, is often used to describe the difference between the combinatorial chemistry libraries and natural products. The synthetic, combinatorial library compounds seem to cover only a limited and quite uniform chemical space, whereas existing drugs and particularly natural products, exhibit much greater chemical diversity, distributing more evenly to the chemical space. The most prominent differences between natural products and compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries is the number of chiral centers (much higher in natural compounds), structure rigidity (higher in natural compounds) and number of aromatic moieties (higher in combinatorial chemistry libraries). Other chemical differences between these two groups include the nature of heteroatoms (O and N enriched in natural products, and S and halogen atoms more often present in synthetic compounds), as well as level of non-aromatic unsaturation (higher in natural products). As both structure rigidity and chirality are well-established factors in medicinal chemistry known to enhance compounds specificity and efficacy as a drug, it has been suggested that natural products compare favourably to today&#x27;s combinatorial chemistry libraries as potential lead molecules.

=== Screening ===
Two main approaches exist for the finding of new bioactive chemical entities from natural sources.

The first is sometimes referred to as random collection and screening of material, but the collection is far from random. Biological (often botanical) knowledge is often used to identify families that show promise. This approach is effective because only a small part of the earth&#x27;s biodiversity has ever been tested for pharmaceutical activity. Also, organisms living in a species-rich environment need to evolve defensive and competitive mechanisms to survive. Those mechanisms might be exploited in the development of beneficial drugs.

A collection of plant, animal and microbial samples from rich ecosystems can potentially give rise to novel biological activities worth exploiting in the drug development process. One example of successful use of this strategy is the screening for antitumor agents by the National Cancer Institute, which started in the 1960s. Paclitaxel was identified from Pacific yew tree &quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;. Paclitaxel showed anti-tumour activity by a previously undescribed mechanism (stabilization of microtubules) and is now approved for clinical use for the treatment of lung, breast, and ovarian cancer, as well as for Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. Early in the 21st century, Cabazitaxel (made by Sanofi, a French firm), another relative of taxol has been shown effective against prostate cancer, also because it works by preventing the formation of microtubules, which pull the chromosomes apart in dividing cells (such as cancer cells). Other examples are: 1. Camptotheca (Camptothecin · Topotecan · Irinotecan · Rubitecan · Belotecan); 2. Podophyllum (Etoposide · Teniposide); 3a. Anthracyclines (Aclarubicin · Daunorubicin · Doxorubicin · Epirubicin · Idarubicin · Amrubicin · Pirarubicin · Valrubicin · Zorubicin); 3b. Anthracenediones (Mitoxantrone · Pixantrone).

The second main approach involves ethnobotany, the study of the general use of plants in society, and ethnopharmacology, an area inside ethnobotany, which is focused specifically on medicinal uses.

Artemisinin, an antimalarial agent from sweet wormtree &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;, used in Chinese medicine since 200BC is one drug used as part of combination therapy for multiresistant &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;.

Additionally, since machine learning has become more advanced, virtual screening is now an option for drug developers. AI algorithms are being used to perform virtual screening of chemical compounds, which involves predicting the activity of a compound against a specific target. By using machine learning algorithms to analyse large amounts of chemical data, researchers can identify potential new drug candidates that are more likely to be effective against a specific disease. Algorithms, such as Nearest-Neighbour classifiers, RF, extreme learning machines, SVMs, and deep neural networks (DNNs), are used for VS based on synthesis feasibility and can also predict in vivo activity and toxicity.

=== Structural elucidation ===
The elucidation of the chemical structure is critical to avoid the re-discovery of a chemical agent that is already known for its structure and chemical activity. Mass spectrometry is a method in which individual compounds are identified based on their mass/charge ratio, after ionization. Chemical compounds exist in nature as mixtures, so the combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is often used to separate the individual chemicals. Databases of mass spectra for known compounds are available and can be used to assign a structure to an unknown mass spectrum. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the primary technique for determining chemical structures of natural products. NMR yields information about individual hydrogen and carbon atoms in the structure, allowing detailed reconstruction of the molecule&#x27;s architecture.

==New Drug Application==

When a drug is developed with evidence throughout its history of research to show it is safe and effective for the intended use in the United States, the company can file an application – the New Drug Application (NDA) – to have the drug commercialized and available for clinical application. NDA status enables the FDA to examine all submitted data on the drug to reach a decision on whether to approve or not approve the drug candidate based on its safety, specificity of effect, and efficacy of doses.

<text>The King Chulalongkorn Memorial Building () is a Thai pavilion (Sala Thai) in Utanede, Sweden (part of the Ragunda Municipality) built to commemorate the 1897 visit of King Chulalongkorn of Thailand to the town.
The construction of the building started in August 1997 and it was inaugurated on July 19, 1998, at the 101 anniversary of King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s visit.

The building is in the style of a royal Thai pavilion (&quot;prasat&quot;) with a surface of ten by ten meters and a height of 28 meters. The roof is supported by 24 pillars in white concrete around the building with its four entrances.

The pavilion is adorned with gold leaf ornamentation with a value of three million Swedish kronor or 14 million Thai baht.

<doc id="571280" wikidata="Q1460196" url="?curid=571280" title="Stratification (mathematics)">
<text>Stratification has several usages in mathematics.

==In mathematical logic==

In mathematical logic, stratification is any consistent assignment of numbers to predicate symbols guaranteeing that a unique formal interpretation of a logical theory exists. Specifically, we say that a set of clauses of the form formula_1 is stratified if and only if
there is a stratification assignment S that fulfills the following conditions:

# If a predicate P is positively derived from a predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs positively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than or equal to the stratification number of Q, in short formula_2.
# If a predicate P is derived from a negated predicate Q (i.e., P is the head of a rule, and Q occurs negatively in the body of the same rule), then the stratification number of P must be greater than the stratification number of Q, in short formula_3.

The notion of stratified negation leads to a very effective operational semantics for stratified programs in terms of the stratified least fixpoint, that is obtained by iteratively applying the fixpoint operator to each &quot;stratum&quot; of the program, from the lowest one up.
Stratification is not only useful for guaranteeing unique interpretation of Horn clause
theories. 

==In a specific set theory==

In New Foundations (NF) and related set theories, a formula formula_4 in the language of first-order logic with equality and membership is said to be
stratified if and only if there is a function
formula_5 which sends each variable appearing in formula_4 (considered as an item of syntax) to
a natural number (this works equally well if all integers are used) in such a way that
any atomic formula formula_7 appearing in formula_4 satisfies formula_9 and any atomic formula formula_10 appearing in formula_4 satisfies formula_12.

It turns out that it is sufficient to require that these conditions be satisfied only when
both variables in an atomic formula are bound in the set abstract formula_13
under consideration. A set abstract satisfying this weaker condition is said to be
weakly stratified.

The stratification of New Foundations generalizes readily to languages with more
predicates and with term constructions. Each primitive predicate needs to have specified
required displacements between values of formula_5 at its (bound) arguments
in a (weakly) stratified formula. In a language with term constructions, terms themselves
need to be assigned values under formula_5, with fixed displacements from the
values of each of their (bound) arguments in a (weakly) stratified formula. Defined term
constructions are neatly handled by (possibly merely implicitly) using the theory
of descriptions: a term formula_16 (the x such that formula_4) must
be assigned the same value under formula_5 as the variable x.

A formula is stratified if and only if it is possible to assign types to all variables appearing
in the formula in such a way that it will make sense in a version TST of the theory of
types described in the New Foundations article, and this is probably the best way
to understand the stratification of New Foundations in practice.

The notion of stratification can be extended to the lambda calculus; this is found
in papers of Randall Holmes.

A motivation for the use of stratification is to address Russell&#x27;s paradox, the antinomy considered to have undermined Frege&#x27;s central work &quot;Grundgesetze der Arithmetik&quot; (1902).
==In topology==
In singularity theory, there is a different meaning, of a decomposition of a topological space &quot;X&quot; into disjoint subsets each of which is a topological manifold (so that in particular a &quot;stratification&quot; defines a partition of the topological space). This is not a useful notion when unrestricted; but when the various strata are defined by some recognisable set of conditions (for example being locally closed), and fit together manageably, this idea is often applied in geometry. Hassler Whitney and René Thom first defined formal conditions for stratification. See Whitney stratification and topologically stratified space.

==In statistics==

<text>The class was a class of four dreadnought battleships built by the German (Imperial Navy). The class comprised , , , and . Construction started on the ships shortly before World War I; was laid down in 1913, and followed in 1914, and , the final ship, was laid down in 1915. Only and were completed, due to shipbuilding priorities changing as the war dragged on. It was determined that U-boats were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, and were the last German battleships completed by the .

 and were commissioned into the fleet in July 1916 and March 1917, respectively. This was too late for either ship to take part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. was assigned to the naval force that drove the Imperial Russian Navy from the Gulf of Riga during Operation Albion in October 1917, though the ship was severely damaged by a mine and had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs. replaced as the flagship of the High Seas Fleet, but saw no combat.

Both and were interned at Scapa Flow following the Armistice in November 1918. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, the commander of the interned German fleet, ordered his ships be sunk on 21 June 1919; was successfully scuttled, though British guards managed to beach to prevent her from sinking. The ship was expended as a gunnery target in 1921. and , both at various stages of completion when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal. was raised in 1934 and broken up the following year.

== Design ==

Design work on the class began as early as 1910, with great consideration given to the armament of the new vessels. It had become clear that other navies were moving to guns larger than , and so the next German battleship would also have to incorporate larger guns. The Weapons Department suggested a gun, but during a meeting on 11 May 1910, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the (Imperial Naval Office), decided that budgetary constraints precluded the adoption of larger weapons. The following year, in the aftermath of the Agadir Crisis, Tirpitz quickly seized on public outcry over the British involvement in the crisis to pressure the (Imperial Diet) into appropriating additional funds for the Navy. This provided the opening for more powerful battleships, so Tirpitz requested funds for ships armed with guns in mid-1911.

In August that year, the design staff prepared studies for ships armed with , , and guns; the 40 cm caliber was set as the maximum, since it was (incorrectly) assumed that British wire-wound guns larger than that could not be built. During a meeting the following month, the preferred designs were a ship armed with ten 35 cm guns in five turrets or eight 40 cm guns in four turrets. The Weapons Department advocated the 35 cm gun ship, pointing out that it would have a 25% greater chance of hitting its target. Tirpitz inquired about a mixed battery of twin and triple turrets, but after examining the gun turrets of the Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts of the , it was determined that the triple gun turrets still had too many problems. Among these deficiencies were increased weight, reduced ammunition supply and rate of fire, and loss of fighting capability if one of the turrets was disabled.

Design studies suggested that the 35 cm ship would displace around and cost around 59.7 million marks, while the 40 cm proposal would cost approximately 60 million marks and displace , but both of these ships were deemed to be too expensive. The Construction Department proposed a ship armed with eight 38 cm guns, which reduced the cost to 57.5 million marks per vessel. This design was adopted as the basis for the next class of battleship on 26 September, and the decision to adopt the 38 cm gun was formally taken on 6 January 1912. Work continued on the design into 1912, and included further developing the armor layout that had been adopted in the previous . The ships were originally projected to be armed with eight anti-aircraft guns, though they were not completed with any. Since the development of diesel engines was proving to be problematic, the design staff adopted traditional steam turbines for the ships, though it was hoped that by the time the third member of the class was ready to begin construction, reliable diesel engines would be available.

Funding for the vessels was allocated under the fourth Naval Law, which was passed in 1912. The Fourth Naval Law secured funding for three new dreadnoughts, two light cruisers, and an increase of an additional 15,000 officers and men in the ranks of the Navy for 1912. The capital ships laid down in 1912 were the s; funding for and was allocated the following year. Funding for was allocated in the 1914 budget, while was funded in the War Estimates. The last remaining pre-dreadnought, , was to be replaced, as well as two elderly pre-dreadnoughts, and . was ordered as , as , and as ; was regarded as an addition to the fleet, and was ordered under the provisional name &quot;T&quot;.

=== General characteristics ===
 and were long at the waterline, and an even long overall. and were slightly longer: at the waterline and overall. All four ships had a beam of , and had a draft of between . and were designed to displace at a normal displacement; at full combat load, the ships displaced up to . and were slightly heavier, at 28,800 t normal and 32,500 t fully laden. The ships were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were riveted. The hull was divided into 17 watertight compartments, and included a double bottom that ran for 88 percent of the length of the hull.

 and were regarded as exceptional sea boats by the German navy. and her sisters were stable and very maneuverable. The ships suffered slight speed loss in heavy seas; with the rudders hard over, the ships lost up to 62% speed and heeled over 7 degrees. With a metacentric height of , larger than that of their British equivalents, the vessels were stable gun platforms for the confined waters of the North Sea. The ships of the class had a standard crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men; when serving as a squadron flagship, an additional 14 officers and 86 men were required. The vessels carried several smaller craft, including one picket boat, three barges, two launches, two yawls, and two dinghies.

=== Machinery ===

 and were equipped with eleven coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft boilers and three oil-fired Schulz-Thornycroft boilers in nine boiler rooms. Three sets of Parsons turbines drove three-bladed screws that were in diameter. ″s and ″s power plant was designed to run at at 265 revolutions per minute; on trials the ships achieved and , respectively. Both ships were capable of a maximum speed of . The first two ships were designed to carry of coal and of oil, though the use of additional spaces in the hull increased the total bunkerage to of coal and of oil. This enabled a range of at a speed of . At , the range decreased to , at the range fell to , and at the ships could steam for only . The ships carried eight diesel generators; these supplied each ship with a total of 2,400 kilowatts of electrical power at 220 volts.

 and were intended to be one knot faster than the earlier pair of ships. received more powerful machinery that would have produced for a designed speed of 22 knots. On , a MAN diesel engine producing was to be installed on the center shaft, while steam turbines powered the outboard shafts, but the diesel engine was not ready by the end of the war, and it was only completed in 1919 for testing by the Naval Inter-Allied Control Commission. The combined power plant would have produced for a designed speed of 22.5 knots.

=== Armament ===

The -class battleships were armed with a main battery of eight 38 cm (15 in) SK L/45 guns in four Drh LC/1913 twin gun turrets. These turrets allowed for depression of the guns to −8 degrees and elevation to 16 degrees. The guns had to be returned to 2.5 degrees to reload them. The gun mountings for were later modified to allow elevation up to 20 degrees, though the changes reduced depression to −5 degrees. As originally configured, the guns had a maximum range of , but ″s modified guns could reach . Each turret was fitted with a stereo rangefinder. The main battery was supplied with a total of 720 shells or 90 rounds per gun; these were shells that were light for guns of their caliber. The shell allotment was divided between armor piercing and high explosive versions, with 60 of the former and 30 of the latter. At a range of , the armor-piercing shells could penetrate up to of steel plate. The guns had a rate of fire of around one shell every 38 seconds. Muzzle velocity was .

Post-war tests conducted by the British Royal Navy showed that the guns on could be ready to fire again 23 seconds after firing; this was significantly faster than their British contemporaries, the , which took 36 seconds between salvos. While the German guns were faster to reload, the British inspectors found German anti-flash precautions to be significantly inferior to those that had been adopted by the Royal Navy after 1917, though this was to some degree mitigated by the brass propellant cases, which were far less susceptible to flash detonations than the silk-bagged British cordite. The guns that had been constructed for the battleships and were used as long-range, heavy siege guns on the Western Front, as coastal guns in occupied France and Belgium, and a few as railway guns; these guns were referred to as &quot;Langer Max&quot;&quot;.

The ships were also armed with a secondary battery of sixteen SK L/45 quick-firing guns, each mounted in armored casemates in the side of the top deck. These guns were intended for defense against torpedo boats, and were supplied with a total of 2,240 shells. The guns could engage targets out to , and after improvements in 1915, their range was extended to . The guns had a sustained rate of fire of 5 to 7 rounds per minute. The shells were 45.3 kg (99.8 lb), and were loaded with a 13.7 kg (31.2 lb) RPC/12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge. The guns fired at a muzzle velocity of 835 meters per second (2,740 ft/s). The guns were expected to fire around 1,400 shells before they needed to be replaced. and were also equipped with a pair of SK L/45 flak guns, which were supplied with 800 rounds. The guns were emplaced in MPL C/13 mountings, which allowed depression to −10 degrees and elevation to 70 degrees. These guns fired 9 kg (19.8 lb) shells, and had an effective ceiling of at 70 degrees.

As was customary on capital ships of the period, the -class ships were armed with five 60 cm (24 in) submerged torpedo tubes. One tube was mounted in the bow and two on each broadside. A total of 20 torpedoes were carried per ship. When both and struck mines in 1917, the damage incurred revealed structural weaknesses caused by the torpedo tubes and both ships had their lateral tubes removed. The torpedoes were the H8 type, which were long and carried a 210 kg (463 lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedoes had a range of when set at a speed of ; at a reduced speed of , the range increased significantly to .

=== Armor ===

The -class ships were protected with Krupp cemented steel armor, as was the standard for German warships of the period. They had an armor belt that was thick in the central citadel of the ship, where the most important parts of the ship were located. This included the ammunition magazines and the machinery spaces. The belt was reduced in less critical areas, to forward and aft. The bow and stern were not protected by armor at all. A -thick torpedo bulkhead ran the length of the hull, several meters behind the main belt. The main armored deck was thick in most places, though the thickness of the sections that covered the more important areas of the ship was increased to .

The forward conning tower was protected with heavy armor: the sides were thick and the roof was 170 mm thick. The rear conning tower was less well armored; its sides were only 170 mm thick and the roof was covered with of armor plate. The main battery gun turrets were also heavily armored: the turret sides were 350 mm thick and the roofs were 200 mm thick. The 15 cm guns had 170 mm thick armor plating on the casemates; the guns themselves had 80 mm thick shields to protect their crews from shell splinters.

″s armor layout was modified slightly as a result of the planned diesel engine, which was significantly taller than a turbine. A glacis over the diesel was added that was 200 mm thick on the sides, thick on either end, and 80 mm thick on top. Her belt was also slightly modified, with extending past the forward 200 mm thick section all the way to the stem.

== Construction ==
The class was planned to include four ships. was built by Howaldtswerke in Kiel under construction number 590; she was laid down in 1913, launched on 18 February 1915, and completed on 15 July 1916. was built by the Schichau shipyard in Danzig, under construction number 913. The ship was launched on 30 October 1915 and commissioned into the fleet on 14 March 1917. was laid down at the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel, under construction number 210. She was launched on 21 November 1916, but not completed. was by then 9 months from completion. was constructed by AG Vulcan shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 19. She was launched on 20 June 1917, but she too was not completed and scrapped in 1921. At the time of cancellation, was approximately 12 months from completion.

== Service history ==

=== Fleet sortie of 18–19 August 1916 ===

During the fleet sortie on 18–19 August 1916, I Scouting Group, which was the battlecruiser reconnaissance force of the High Seas Fleet and commanded by Admiral Franz von Hipper, was to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. As and were the only two remaining German battlecruisers still in fighting condition after the Battle of Jutland, three dreadnoughts were assigned to the unit for the operation: , and the two -class ships and . Admiral Scheer and the rest of the High Seas Fleet, with 15 dreadnoughts of its own, would trail behind and provide cover. The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.

=== Operation Albion ===

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to evict the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. To this end, the (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic islands of Ösel, particularly the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint Army-Navy operation to capture Ösel and Moon islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, the battlecruiser , along with III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. V Division included the four -class battleships, and was by this time augmented with . VI Division consisted of the five s. Along with nine light cruisers, 3 torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, and were supported by over 100 aircraft and 6 zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on Ösel numbered some 14,000 men.

The operation began on 12 October, when , , and the s began firing on the Russian shore batteries at Tagga Bay. Simultaneously, the s engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and Dagö islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the gulf. Both and struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions; damage to the former was minimal, and the ship remained in action. was severely damaged, and temporary repairs proved ineffective. The ship had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs; the return trip took 19 days.

=== Fleet sortie of 23–24 April 1918 ===
In late 1917, the High Seas Fleet began to conduct anti-convoy raids with light craft in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. On 17 October, the German light cruisers and intercepted a convoy of twelve ships escorted by a pair of destroyers and destroyed it; only three transports managed to escape. On 12 December, four German destroyers intercepted and annihilated another convoy of five ships and two escorting destroyers. This prompted Admiral David Beatty, the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect the convoys in the North Sea. This presented to Admiral Scheer the opportunity for which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet.

At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the entire High Seas Fleet, including and , left harbor with the intention of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. At 05:10 on 24 April, the battlecruiser suffered severe mechanical problems and had to be towed back to Wilhelmshaven. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters. In fact, there was no convoy sailing on 24 April; German naval intelligence had miscalculated the sailing date by one day.

=== Wilhelmshaven mutiny ===

In October 1918, Admiral Hipper, now the commander of the entire High Seas Fleet, planned for a final battle with the Grand Fleet. Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the Chief of the Naval Staff, approved the plan on 27 October; the operation was set for the 30th. When the fleet was ordered to assemble in Wilhelmshaven on 29 October, war-weary crews began to desert or openly disobey their orders. Crews aboard the battleships , , and demonstrated for peace. The crew aboard was the first to openly mutiny; and joined as well. By the evening of the 29th, red flags of revolution flew from the masts of dozens of warships in the harbor. In spite of this, Hipper decided to hold a last meeting aboard —his flagship—to discuss the operation with the senior officers of the fleet. The following morning, it was clear the mutiny was too far gone to permit a fleet action. In an attempt to suppress the revolt, he ordered one of the battle squadrons to depart for Kiel. By 5 November, red flags had been raised on every battleship in the harbor except , though it too was commandeered by a sailors&#x27; council on 6 November.

=== Fate ===

Following the armistice with Germany in November 1918, the majority of the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the British naval base at Scapa Flow. was listed as one of the ships to be handed over, though initially was not. The battlecruiser , which the British believed to be completed, was requested instead. When it became apparent to the Allies that was still under construction, was ordered to replace it. On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. arrived at Scapa Flow separately on 14 December 1918.

When the ships were interned, they had their guns disabled through the removal of their breech blocks. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. It became apparent to Reuter that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. sank at 14:30, but was run aground by British guards; she was the only capital ship that was not sunk. After being refloated and thoroughly examined, was expended as a gunnery target, finally being sunk on 16 August 1921 to the southwest of Portsmouth. was raised for scrapping on 1 September 1934 and broken up over the following year in Rosyth.

The uncompleted and were stricken from the German Navy under the terms of of the Versailles Treaty. was sold for scrapping in 1920 to ship breakers at the Kiel Arsenal. was sold the following year, and broken up in Hamburg.

<text>Solidarité Française (&quot;French Solidarity&quot;) was a French far-right league founded in 1933 by the perfume manufacturer François Coty (1874-1934) as the &quot;Parti national corporatif républicain&quot;.

After Coty&#x27;s death, it was commanded by Major Jean Renaud, members dressed in blue shirts, black berets and jackboots and shouted the slogan &quot;France for the French&quot;.

The movement claimed a strength of 180,000 in 1934, with 80,000 in Paris, but the Paris police thought the number in the city to be closer to 15,000. The small membership did not, however, isolate the group since it found itself integrated in the loose coalition of far-right movements that included Charles Maurras&#x27;s Action Française and Pierre Taittinger&#x27;s Jeunesse Patriotes.

The group gained notoriety during the rally, which later became a riot, during the 6 February 1934 crisis in front of the Palais Bourbon. The group was dissolved by a law adopted by the Popular Front government of Léon Blum in June 1936. Many members of &quot;Solidarité Française&quot; subsequently joined Jacques Doriot&#x27;s fascist Parti populaire français (PPF).

<text>The Compagnons du Devoir (), full name Compagnons du Devoir et du Tour de France (), is a French organization of craftsmen and artisans dating from the Middle Ages. Their traditional, technical education includes taking a tour, the &quot;Tour de France,&quot; around France and doing apprenticeships with masters. For a young man or young woman today, the &quot;Compagnonnage&quot; is a traditional mentoring network through which to learn a trade while developing character by experiencing community life and traveling. The community lives in a Compagnon house known as a &quot;cayenne&quot; and managed by a &quot;mère&quot; (mother) or &quot;maîtresse&quot; (mistress), a woman who looks after the well-being of the residents, of which there are more than 80 in France. The houses vary in size from a small house for five people to a larger one with more than 100 people living together.

Until 2005, the compagnons were all male. Today, they can be found in 49 countries across five continents, practising many different trades.

A similar tradition exists for German &quot;Wandergesellen&quot;, or journeymen, to set out on the Wanderjahre.

&quot;Tour de France&quot; simply refers to the fact that the Compagnons travel throughout France; every six months to a year they are required to change work locations. This is unrelated to the Tour de France cycling competition. The word &quot;compagnon&quot; (companion) is derived from the Old French &quot;compaignon,&quot; a person with whom one breaks bread.

==Stages==
The prerequisite to start a Tour de France is possession of a &quot;Certificat d&#x27;aptitude professionelle&quot; (certificate of professional aptitude). Consisting of classes and an apprenticeship, it is the basic French trade qualification.

A first-year aspiring compagnon, known as a &quot;stagiaire&quot; (apprentice), works full-time in the trade on weekdays and lives in the compagnon house. Dinner is eaten together at the &quot;siège&quot; (seat or lodge) of compagnons. Those who want to become compagnons apply for the adoption ceremony.

Next the stagiaire undertakes a &quot;travail d&#x27;adoption&quot;, a project that must be submitted to become an &quot;aspirant&quot; (aspiring/one who aspires). The aspirant is then given a name according to their region or town of origin; for example, someone from Burgundy might be called &quot;Bourguignon&quot;. The aspirant receives a sash and a ceremonial walking staff representing the itinerant nature of the organisation. The ceremony is private, and includes only compagnons and aspirants.

An aspirant works full-time on weekdays and stays in the compagnon house. Dinner is eaten together at the house. The aspirant stays or tours in several towns over the next three to five years, working under compagnons, to learn the trade.

Eventually, the aspirant presents a masterpiece (&quot;travail de réception&quot; or &quot;chef-d&#x27;œuvre&quot;) to the board of compagnons. Masterpieces vary according to the aspirant&#x27;s trade. If accepted, one may become a &quot;compagnon itinérant&quot;, receive a compagnon name and be presented with a new walking stick that reaches the height of the heart. Some of the masterpieces are displayed at the &quot;Musées du Compagnonnage&quot; in Tours and Paris.

The compagnon itinérant then does three more years of touring. They then becomes a &quot;compagnon sédentaire&quot; and can choose where to live and work, and will then begin to teach the trade to apprentices.

==Daily life==
A typical weekday for a &quot;charpentier&quot; (carpenter) would involve a day on-site working full-time for the company that employs the aspirant. Dinner is usually held between 7:00 and 8:00 with the community living in the house. There are then classes until 10 pm in technical drawing, technology, French, English, mathematics, etc. On Saturdays, classes are from 8 am-12 pm and 1:30 pm–5:30 pm. The carpenters acquire skills through working on different projects and lessons. They create many maquettes; these wooden models of a planned project are conceived first through drawings, then assembled in wood. A carpenter will make many during the aspirant phase. Each piece is expected to demonstrate the progress made in mastering a given skill or lesson. Sundays are spent in exploring the conception of a masterpiece.

The initiation process has been described as a rite of passage, as defined by Arnold Van Gennep. It illustrates his theory in the early 20th century of the rite of passage, with its successive stages of isolation, marginality, and aggregation into the social body.

==History==
The organization dates to medieval times, when the Compagnons built the churches and castles of France, and were persecuted by kings and the Catholic Church because they refused to live under the rules of either institution.

As a craftsman&#x27;s guild, the Compagnonnage was banned by the National Assembly under the Le Chapelier Law of 1791, which was repealed in 1864.

During the German occupation of France during World War II, the Compagnons were persecuted by the Nazi occupiers, who thought they were related to the Freemasons.

<text>In computing, position-independent code (PIC) or position-independent executable (PIE) is a body of machine code that executes properly regardless of its memory address. PIC is commonly used for shared libraries, so that the same library code can be loaded at a location in each program&#x27;s address space where it does not overlap with other memory in use by, for example, other shared libraries. PIC was also used on older computer systems that lacked an MMU, so that the operating system could keep applications away from each other even within the single address space of an MMU-less system.

Position-independent code can be executed at any memory address without modification. This differs from absolute code, which must be loaded at a specific location to function correctly, and load-time locatable (LTL) code, in which a linker or program loader modifies a program before execution, so it can be run only from a particular memory location. Generating position-independent code is often the default behavior for compilers, but they may place restrictions on the use of some language features, such as disallowing use of absolute addresses (position-independent code has to use relative addressing). Instructions that refer directly to specific memory addresses sometimes execute faster, and replacing them with equivalent relative-addressing instructions may result in slightly slower execution, although modern processors make the difference practically negligible.

== History ==
In early computers such as the IBM 701 (29 April 1952) or the UNIVAC I (31 March 1951) code was not position-independent: each program was built to load into and run from a particular address. Those early computers did not have an operating system and were not multitasking-capable. Programs were loaded into main storage (or even stored on magnetic drum for execution directly from there) and run one at a time. In such an operational context, position-independent code was not necessary.

Even on base and bounds systems such as the CDC 6600, the GE 625 and the UNIVAC 1107, once the OS loaded code into a job&#x27;s storage, it could only run from the relative address at which it was loaded.

Burroughs introduced a segmented system, the B5000 (1961), in which programs addressed segments indirectly via control words on the stack or in the program reference table (PRT); a shared segment could be addressed via different PRT locations in different processes. Similarly, on the later B6500, all segment references were via positions in a stack frame.

The IBM System/360 (7 April 1964) was designed with truncated addressing similar to that of the UNIVAC III, with code position independence in mind. In truncated addressing, memory addresses are calculated from a &quot;base register&quot; and an offset. At the beginning of a program, the programmer must establish &quot;addressability&quot; by loading a base register; normally, the programmer also informs the assembler with a &quot;USING&quot; pseudo-op. The programmer can load the base register from a register known to contain the entry point address, typically R15, or can use the BALR (Branch And Link, Register form) instruction (with a R2 Value of 0) to store the next sequential instruction&#x27;s address into the base register, which was then coded explicitly or implicitly in each instruction that referred to a storage location within the program. Multiple base registers could be used, for code or for data. Such instructions require less memory because they do not have to hold a full 24, 31, 32, or 64 bit address (4 or 8 bytes), but instead a base register number (encoded in 4 bits) and a 12–bit address offset (encoded in 12 bits), requiring only two bytes.

This programming technique is standard on IBM S/360 type systems. It has been in use through to today&#x27;s IBM System/z. When coding in assembly language, the programmer has to establish addressability for the program as described above and also use other base registers for dynamically allocated storage. Compilers automatically take care of this kind of addressing.

IBM&#x27;s early operating system DOS/360 (1966) was not using virtual storage (since the early models of System S/360 did not support it), but it did have the ability to place programs to an arbitrary (or automatically chosen) storage location during loading via the PHASE name,* JCL (Job Control Language) statement.

So, on S/360 systems without virtual storage, a program could be loaded at any storage location, but this required a contiguous memory area large enough to hold that program. Sometimes memory fragmentation would occur from loading and unloading differently sized modules. Virtual storage - by design - does not have that limitation.

While DOS/360 and OS/360 did not support PIC, transient SVC routines in OS/360 could not contain relocatable address constants and could run in any of the transient areas without relocation.

IBM first introduced virtual storage on IBM System/360 model 67 in (1965) to support IBM&#x27;s first multi-tasking operating and time-sharing operating system TSS/360. Later versions of DOS/360 (DOS/VS etc.) and later IBM operating systems all utilized virtual storage. Truncated addressing remained as part of the base architecture, and still advantageous when multiple modules must be loaded into the same virtual address space.

By way of comparison, on early segmented systems such as Burroughs MCP on the Burroughs B5000 (1961) and Multics (1964), and on paging systems such as IBM TSS/360 (1967), code was also inherently position-independent, since subroutine virtual addresses in a program were located in private data external to the code, e.g., program reference table, linkage segment, prototype section.

The invention of dynamic address translation (the function provided by an MMU) originally reduced the need for position-independent code because every process could have its own independent address space (range of addresses). 
However, multiple simultaneous jobs using the same code created a waste of physical memory. If two jobs run entirely identical programs, dynamic address translation provides a solution by allowing the system simply to map two different jobs&#x27; address 32K to the same bytes of real memory, containing the single copy of the program.

Different programs may share common code. For example, the payroll program and the accounts receivable program may both contain an identical sort subroutine. A shared module (a shared library is a form of shared module) gets loaded once and mapped into the two address spaces.

== SunOS 4.x and ELF ==
Procedure calls inside a shared library are typically made through small procedure linkage table (PLT) stubs, which then call the definitive function. This notably allows a shared library to inherit certain function calls from previously loaded libraries rather than using its own versions.

Data references from position-independent code are usually made indirectly, through Global Offset Tables (GOTs), which store the addresses of all accessed global variables. There is one GOT per compilation unit or object module, and it is located at a fixed offset from the code (although this offset is not known until the library is linked). When a linker links modules to create a shared library, it merges the GOTs and sets the final offsets in code. It is not necessary to adjust the offsets when loading the shared library later.

Position-independent functions access global data start by determining the absolute address of the GOT given their own current program counter value. This often takes the form of a fake function call in order to obtain the return value on stack (x86), in a specific standard register (SPARC, MIPS), or a special register (POWER/PowerPC/Power ISA), which can then be moved to a predefined standard register, or to obtain it into that standard register (PA-RISC, Alpha, ESA/390 and z/Architecture). Some processor architectures, such as the Motorola 68000, ARM, x86-64, newer versions of z/Architecture, Motorola 6809, WDC 65C816, and Knuth&#x27;s MMIX allow referencing data by offset from the program counter. This is specifically targeted at making position-independent code smaller, less register demanding and hence more efficient.

== Windows DLLs ==
Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) in Microsoft Windows use variant E8 of the CALL instruction (Call near, relative, displacement relative to next instruction). These instructions do not need modification when the DLL is loaded.

Some global variables (e.g. arrays of string literals, virtual function tables) are expected to contain an address of an object in data section respectively in code section of the dynamic library; therefore, the stored address in the global variable must be updated to reflect the address where the DLL was loaded to. The dynamic loader calculates the address referred to by a global variable and stores the value in such global variable; this triggers copy-on-write of a memory page containing such global variable. Pages with code and pages with global variables that do not contain pointers to code or global data remain shared between processes. This operation must be done in any OS that can load a dynamic library at arbitrary address.

In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, the relocation of DLLs and executables is done by the kernel memory manager, which shares the relocated binaries across multiple processes. Images are always relocated from their preferred base addresses, achieving address space layout randomization (ASLR).

Versions of Windows prior to Vista require that system DLLs be prelinked at non-conflicting fixed addresses at the link time in order to avoid runtime relocation of images. Runtime relocation in these older versions of Windows is performed by the DLL loader within the context of each process, and the resulting relocated portions of each image can no longer be shared between processes.

The handling of DLLs in Windows differs from the earlier OS/2 procedure it derives from. OS/2 presents a third alternative and attempts to load DLLs that are not position-independent into a dedicated &quot;shared arena&quot; in memory, and maps them once they are loaded. All users of the DLL are able to use the same in-memory copy.

== Multics ==
In Multics each procedure conceptually has a code segment and a linkage segment.
 The code segment contains only code and the linkage section serves as a template for a new linkage segment. Pointer register 4 (PR4) points to the linkage segment of the procedure. A call to a procedure saves PR4 in the stack before loading it with a pointer to the callee&#x27;s linkage segment. The procedure call uses an indirect pointer pair with a flag to cause a trap on the first call so that the dynamic linkage mechanism can add the new procedure and its linkage segment to the Known Segment Table (KST), construct a new linkage segment, put their segment numbers in the caller&#x27;s linkage section and reset the flag in the indirect pointer pair.

== TSS ==
In IBM S/360 Time Sharing System (TSS/360 and TSS/370) each procedure may have a read-only public CSECT and a writable private Prototype Section (PSECT). A caller loads a V-constant for the routine into General Register 15 (GR15) and copies an R-constant for the routine&#x27;s PSECT into the 19th word of the save area pointed to be GR13.

The Dynamic Loader does not load program pages or resolve address constants until the first page fault.

== Position-independent executables ==

&quot;Position-independent executables&quot; (PIE) are executable binaries made entirely from position-independent code. While some systems only run PIC executables, there are other reasons they are used. PIE binaries are used in some security-focused Linux distributions to allow PaX or Exec Shield to use address space layout randomization (ASLR) to prevent attackers from knowing where existing executable code is during a security attack using exploits that rely on knowing the offset of the executable code in the binary, such as return-to-libc attacks. (The official Linux kernel since 2.6.12 of 2005 has a weaker ASLR that also works with PIE. It is weak in that randomness is applied to whole ELF file units.)

Apple&#x27;s macOS and iOS fully support PIE executables as of versions 10.7 and 4.3, respectively; a warning is issued when non-PIE iOS executables are submitted for approval to Apple&#x27;s App Store but there&#x27;s no hard requirement yet and non-PIE applications are not rejected.

OpenBSD has PIE enabled by default on most architectures since OpenBSD 5.3, released on 1 May 2013. Support for PIE in statically linked binaries, such as the executables in codice_1 and codice_2 directories, was added near the end of 2014. openSUSE added PIE as a default in 2015-02. Beginning with Fedora 23, Fedora maintainers decided to build packages with PIE enabled as the default. Ubuntu 17.10 has PIE enabled by default across all architectures. Gentoo&#x27;s new profiles now support PIE by default. Around July 2017, Debian enabled PIE by default.

Android enabled support for PIEs in Jelly Bean and removed non-PIE linker support in Lollipop.

<text>Benjamin Robins (170729 July 1751) was a pioneering British scientist, Newtonian mathematician, and military engineer.

He wrote an influential treatise on gunnery, for the first time introducing Newtonian science to military men, was an early enthusiast for rifled gun barrels, and his work had substantive influence on the development of artillery during the latter half of the eighteenth century – and directly stimulated the teaching of calculus in military academies.

==Early life==
Benjamin Robins was born in Bath. His parents were Quakers in poor circumstances, and as a result, he received very little formal education. Having come to London on the advice of Dr. Henry Pemberton (1694–1771), who had recognised Robins&#x27;s talents, for a time he maintained himself by teaching mathematics, but soon devoted himself to engineering and the study of fortification.

==Scientific gunnery==

In particular he carried out an extensive series of experiments in gunnery, embodying his results in his famous treatise on &quot;New Principles of Gunnery&quot; (1742), which contains a description of his ballistic pendulum (see chronograph).

Robins also made a number of important experiments on the resistance of the air to the motion of projectiles, and on the force of gunpowder, with computation of the velocities thereby communicated to projectiles. He compared the results of his theory with experimental determinations of the ranges of mortars and cannon, and gave practical maxims for the management of artillery. He also made observations on the flight of rockets, and wrote on the advantages of rifled gun barrels. His work on gunnery was translated into German by Leonhard Euler, who added a critical commentary of his own. However, the work of Robins still served as an important piece of technical information that helped the later advancement of the Prussian artillery, especially of its improvement in accuracy, a big step forwards that the book turned out to be a shot in the arm of the ambitious Frederick the Great who determined to vault the status and power of Prussian artillery to the top among other European armies.

==Mathematics==
Of less interest nowadays are Robins&#x27;s more purely mathematical writings, such as his &quot;Discourse concerning the Nature and Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Methods of Fluxions and of Prime and Ultimate Ratios&quot; (1735), &quot;A Demonstration of the Eleventh Proposition of Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Treatise of Quadratures&quot; (Phil. Trans., 1727), and similar works.

==Politics==
Besides his scientific labours, Robins took an active part in politics. He wrote pamphlets in support of the opposition to Sir Robert Walpole, and was secretary of a committee appointed by the House of Commons to enquire into the conduct of that minister. He also wrote a preface to the &quot;Report on the Proceedings of the Board of General Officers on their Examination into the Conduct of Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope&quot;, in which he gave an apology for the battle of Prestonpans.

In 1749, he was appointed engineer general to the East India Company, and went out to superintend the reconstruction of their forts. However, his health soon failed, and he died at Fort St David in India. His works were published in two volumes in 1761.

<text>The Jeunesses Patriotes (&quot;Young Patriots&quot;, JP) were a far-right league of France, recruited mostly from university students and financed by industrialists founded in 1924 by Pierre Taittinger. Taittinger took inspiration for the group&#x27;s creation in the Boulangist &quot;Ligue des Patriotes&quot; and Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Blackshirts.

According to the police, the &quot;Jeunesses Patriotes&quot; had 90,000 members in the country and 6,000 in Paris in 1932. Its street fighters were led by a retired general named Desofy, and were organized around &quot;Groupes Mobiles&quot;, paramilitary mobile squads of fifty men, outfitted in blue raincoats and berets. The group stated its willingness to combat the &quot;Red Peril&quot; and the &quot;Cartel des Gauches&quot; (Left-wing Coalition), and chose to back Raymond Poincaré who came to power after the Cartel des gauches.

The organization retreated in 1926, but made a comeback in 1932, with the &quot;Cartel des Gauches&quot;″s electoral victory, and took part in the 6 February 1934 riots, an anti-parliamentary street demonstration in Paris in the context of the Stavisky Affair. In 1936, the Popular Front government outlawed the &quot;Jeunesses Patriotes&quot; and other nationalist groups.

<text>An Angel at My Table is a 1990 biographical drama film directed by Jane Campion. The film is based on Janet Frame&#x27;s three autobiographies, &quot;To the Is-Land&quot; (1982), &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Envoy from Mirror City&quot; (1984). The film was very well received. It won awards at the New Zealand Film and Television awards, the Toronto International Film Festival, and second prize at the Venice Film Festival.

==Synopsis==

==Impact and reception==
&quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; was the first film from New Zealand to be screened at the Venice Film Festival, where it received multiple standing ovations and was awarded the Grand Special Jury Prize despite evoking yells of protest that it did not win The Golden Lion. In addition to virtually sweeping the local New Zealand film awards, it also took home the prize for best foreign film at the Independent Spirit Awards and the International Critics&#x27; Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film not only established Jane Campion as an emerging director and launched the career of Kerry Fox, but it also introduced a broader audience to Janet Frame&#x27;s writing.

Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, stating; &quot;[The film] tells its story calmly and with great attention to human detail and, watching it, I found myself drawn in with a rare intensity&quot;. The film also received praise in &quot;The Guardian&quot; where film critic Derek Malcolm called it &quot;one of the very best films of the year&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Angel&quot; is a film where almost every image strikes the eye with the vividness of an inspired art composition: one where small incidents gain magical properties&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; said the film is &quot;potentially painful and harrowing...imbued with gentle humor and great compassion, which makes every character come vividly alive&quot;. In 2019, the BBC polled 368 film experts from 84 countries to name the 100 greatest films directed by women, with &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; voted at No. 47.

<doc id="571313" wikidata="Q1332383" url="?curid=571313" title="François Coty">
<text>François Coty (; born Joseph Marie François Spoturno ; 3 May 1874 – 25 July 1934) was a French perfumer, businessman, newspaper publisher, politician and patron of the arts. He was the founder of the Coty perfume company, today a multinational. He is considered the founding father of the modern perfume industry.

In 1904, his first success, fragrance &quot;La Rose Jacqueminot&quot; launched his career. He soon started exporting perfumes from France, and by 1910 he had subsidiaries in Moscow, London and New York. During the 1917 Russian Revolution, his assets in Moscow, which consisted of stocks and funds were confiscated by the Soviet government, making him a lifelong enemy of Communism.

By the end of World War I, his financial success made him one of the richest men in France, allowing him to act as patron of the arts, collect works of art, historic homes and seek to play a political role.
In 1922, he gained control of daily newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. To check the growth of socialism and Communism in France, he founded two other daily papers in 1928.

In 1923 he was elected senator of Corsica, and was mayor of Ajaccio from 1931 to 1934.

Fearing the spread of communism, he subsidized various right-wing movements. In 1933, faced with a political class that he considered incapable, he published a reform of the State and founded his own movement &quot;Solidarité française&quot;, which became more radical after his death.

At the time of his death, at age 60, his fortune was greatly diminished as a result of his divorce, the high cost of running his press empire and the repercussions of the economic crisis of 1929.

== Early life and family ==

Joseph Marie François Spoturno was born on 3 May 1874 in Ajaccio, Corsica. He claimed to be a descendant of Isabelle Bonaparte, an aunt of Napoleon Bonaparte. His parents were Jean-Baptiste Spoturno and Marie-Adolphine-Françoise Coti, both descendants of Genoese settlers who founded Ajaccio in the 15th century. His parents died when he was a child and the young François was raised by his great-grandmother, Marie Josephe Spoturno, and after her death, by his grandmother, Anna Maria Belone Spoturno, who lived in Marseille.

After spending some years in military service, François met a fellow Corsican named Emmanuel Arène. A politician, writer, and future senator, Arène became François&#x27;s mentor, offering him a job in Paris as his secretary. In Paris, François married Yvonne Alexandrine Le Baron and took the more French-looking name &quot;Coty&quot;, a variation on his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He also met Raymond Goery, a pharmacist who made and sold perfume at his Paris shop. Coty began to learn about perfumery from Goery and created his first fragrance, &quot;Cologne Coty&quot;.

== Perfumer ==

Through Arène, Coty met Léon Chiris, a senator and member of the Chiris family, longtime manufacturers and distributors of perfume. At the Chiris factories in Grasse, in 1903, Coty studied perfumery and began work on a fragrance, &quot;La Rose Jacqueminot&quot;. On his return to Paris in 1900, he visited the Exposition Universelle (1900), (event of the Belle Époque), got married and in 1904, Coty set off to sell his scents to department stores, boutiques, and barbershops, but initially met with little success. His luck changed when he dropped a bottle of &quot;La Rose Jacqueminot&quot; on a countertop at the Grands Magasins du Louvre, the Parisian department store. Attracted by the scent, customers swarmed the area, demanding to buy the perfume. Coty&#x27;s entire stock was gone in a few minutes and the store offered him a place on the selling floor for his products. The success of &quot;La Rose&quot; made Coty a millionaire and established him as a major player in the perfume world.

Coty recognized that an attractive bottle was essential to a perfume&#x27;s success. Though &quot;La Rose&quot; came in a Baccarat bottle, Coty&#x27;s most famous collaboration was with the great ceramist and jeweler René Lalique. Lalique designed the bottles for Coty&#x27;s early scents, such as &quot;Ambre Antique&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Origan&quot;, which became bestsellers. He also designed the labels for Coty perfume, which were printed on a gold background with raised lettering. Lalique&#x27;s designs for Coty were in the Art Nouveau style that was prevalent in the period, and incorporated classic Art Nouveau themes such as nature, flowers, and female figures.

Besides pioneering the concept of bottle design, Coty was responsible for making perfume available to a mass market. Before Coty, perfume was considered a luxury item, affordable only to the very rich. Coty was the first to offer perfumes at many price points.
By combining natural essences and synthetic products from suppliers such as Firmenich, he was able to reduce the costs of production. He is considered as the creator of modern perfumery. His perfumes, in their Lalique and Baccarat bottles, were aimed at the luxury market, but he also sold perfume in smaller, plainer bottles affordable to middle and working-class women. Coty perfume bottles, though mass-produced, were carefully designed to convey an image of luxury and prestige. Coty also invented the idea of a fragrance set, a gift box containing identically scented items, such as a perfume and matching powder, soap, cream, and cosmetics.

Coty summed up his approach to business when he said:

Give a woman the best product to be made, market it in the perfect flask, beautiful in its simplicity yet impeccable in its taste, ask a reasonable price for it, and you will witness the birth of a business the size of which the world has never seen.
In 1908, Coty relocated his manufacturing headquarters to Suresnes, just outside Paris. He acquired property in the area and began to build what would become &quot;La cité des Parfums&quot;, a large complex of laboratories and factories that manufactured his products. &quot;La cité&quot; had 9,000 employees and was able to manufacture up to 100,000 bottles a day. This allowed Coty to meet the burgeoning demand for his products in France and abroad. On the eve of the First World War, Coty perfumes were No. 1 in the world, with branches in Moscow, New York, London and Buenos Aires, and François Coty was already very rich. In 1913, his exclusive agent in the United States since 1910, Benjamin Levy, assisted him in the creation of Coty. in Delaware. In 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian Revolution, his stores, factories, stocks, accounts and deposits at the Crédit Lyonnais in Moscow (nearly 4 million francs at the time) were confiscated by the Bolsheviks.

After World War I, demand for French perfume grew at a rapid pace. Many American soldiers had been stationed in France during the war and they brought back Coty perfumes to their wives and relatives. Coty realized the importance of the lucrative American market and began to distribute his products in the United States.

In 1921, with the help of executive Jean Despres, Coty created an American subsidiary in New York to handle the assembly and distribution of its products in the American market.(Coty&#x27;s headquarters at No. 714 Fifth Avenue is now a registered landmark after restoration of Lalique&#x27;s windows.) The American offices assembled their own Coty products from raw materials sent by the Parisian factories, thus avoiding the high tariffs on luxury products in the United States. This allowed Coty to offer more competitive prices on its products. Later, additional subsidiaries were established in the United Kingdom and Romania.

Coty soon expanded his product line to include cosmetics and skin care, and expanded his distribution network to Europe, Asia, and Latin America. By 1925, 36 million women worldwide used Coty face powders. His most popular product was his &quot;Air-spun&quot; face powder, launched in 1934. Coty collaborated with famous costume designer Léon Bakst to create the look of the Air-spun powder box. It became so popular that soon afterwards Coty launched the Air-spun powder scented with his most popular perfumes, such as &quot;L&#x27;origan&quot; and &quot;Emeraude&quot;.

== Patronage ==

Coty was one of the wealthiest men in France; in 1929, his fortune was estimated at US$34 million. His wealth allowed him to play a role during the années folles, financially funding artistic, early aeronautic endeavours and scientific undertakings. 
His sponsorship included supporting his native Corsica, participating in the development of the electrical infrastructure for the city of Ajaccio, building affordable housing, and establishing a World War I monument. He provided financial support to the French Olympic committee for the 1928 Summer Olympics and toward the attempts of Costes and Bellonte to break aeronautic world records by crossing the Atlantic from Paris To New York in 1930, and the tragic attempt by pilots Joseph Le Brix and René Mesmin, to break the world record for distance flying.
Coty&#x27;s contributions additionally supported the establishment of a new research laboratory for physicist Édouard Branly (radio communications forerunner) within the Catholic institute of Paris and provided support for numerous artists as well as the French Academy in Rome.

== Newspaper publisher and politics ==
In 1923, after a close race, Coty was elected senator of Corsica, but his victory proved short-lived. The French Senate annulled his election in 1924 after accusations of bribery.
In 1922, Coty bought &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, a prestigious conservative newspaper with an upper-class readership. Coty changed the newspaper&#x27;s name to &quot;Figaro&quot; and moved its headquarters to the Rond-Point des Champs-Elysées. Under Coty&#x27;s ownership, the journal, once moderately conservative, adopted an extreme right-wing stance on politics and the economy. &quot;Figaro&quot; printed many fierce anti-Communist articles, and was notorious for its strong opposition to the government. He also subsidized &quot;half a dozen extremist papers, including the &quot;Action française&quot; (to which he gave over five million francs), Cassagnac&#x27;s Bonapartist &quot;Authorité&quot; and &quot;Le Flambeau&quot;, the organ of the Croix de Feu.&quot;

In 1926, Coty worked with Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré to create a fund to stabilize the French currency. He offered to lend 100 million francs to the French government, but was left out of the group appointed to oversee the fund, possibly because of his controversial political views. He then took his money to New York and donated a sizable sum to the French Hospital in New York.

Disappointed once again, in 1926, Coty launched &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot;, a newspaper aimed at the working class. Priced much lower than other competing newspapers, it soon gained a huge readership. He wrote a long series of incendiary articles that did not go unnoticed; on 1 July 1933, he was found guilty in court for libel against Jewish war veterans&#x27; groups in France and in September 1933, he sent a telegram to the Geneva Jewish Community, in which he recanted his anti-Jewish charges and asked that the telegram be read at the Jewish Conference for a World Jewish Congress.

Coty gave financial support to what later became far-right organizations, such as the &quot;Faisceau&quot; and &quot;Croix-de-Feu&quot;, a World War I veterans organization; however, he ended his support after a few years. In 1933, surrounded by courtisans, parasites or scoundrels, misled by more seasoned politicians, he published a Reform of the State and founded his own movement: &quot;French Solidarity&quot;. After his death in July 1934, the movement became more radical.

Coty was a Bonapartist, nationalist, fervent defender of a strong Republic with a preponderance of executive power, like a number of his fellow citizens, in this period of the Third Republic. He wrote two books: &quot;Against Communism&quot;, 1928 and &quot;Save our colonies&quot;, 1931. 
In his Reform of the State, he proposed the election of the President of the Republic by direct universal suffrage, including women&#x27;s votes, with a term of seven years and the possibility of holding two terms, as well as the creation of a supreme court. These measures were in part, later adopted by the Fifth Republic, established by Charles de Gaulle in 1958.

The Stade François Coty in Ajaccio was named after him.

== Personal life ==
Coty and Yvonne had two children, Roland and Christiane. Despite his marriage, Coty was well known for his numerous mistresses and illegitimate children. He was known to house his lovers in Paris&#x27; Hotel Astoria, and to lavish money and gifts on them. His first mistress then second wife was Henriette Dieudé, a former Coty shopgirl who bore him five children. Coty&#x27;s love life was widely publicized in the French liberal newspapers, to the detriment of his public image.

Coty had a penchant for acquiring and remodeling property. His first major purchase was the Château de Longchamp in 1906, near the Bois de Boulogne, once the property of the famous French civic planner, Georges-Eugène Haussmann. Coty used it as a laboratory in which to design his fragrances, bottles, packaging, and advertisements. The renovated Longchamp included a glass dome by Lalique and a stone tower designed by Gustave Eiffel.

In 1912, he bought the Château d&#x27;Artigny near Tours and set out to rebuild it. Over a period of 20 years, Coty rebuilt d&#x27;Artigny in a grandiose fashion, installing custom-built kitchens, ballrooms, and a large fresco depicting himself, his family, friends, and even his mistresses. During the 1920s, he resided with his family in a mansion at Avenue Raphael in the Bois de Boulogne, which Coty had rebuilt with etched-glass panels, a stair rail, and a glass ceiling designed by Lalique.

Coty&#x27;s most famous acquisition was the hunting pavilion of Louveciennes near Saint-Germain-en-Laye, designed by Claude Nicholas Ledoux for Madame du Barry, mistress of Louis XV. Coty had Louveciennes rebuilt to match Ledoux&#x27;s original plan, but enlarged it to include a perfume laboratory and a third story. He also bought the Château Saint-Hélène in Nice, the Villa Namouna in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, and Le Scudo in Ajaccio, Corsica. Though he owned multiple large residences, Coty often lived in a hotel on the Champs-Élysées. He was something of a recluse, disliking crowds of any kind, and hiding behind his public image.

After 1929, Coty&#x27;s fortunes began to diminish considerably. Both &quot;Figaro&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot; had been losing money for years and his perfume business had been affected by the 1929 Wall Street crash. But it was his divorce that most contributed to his financial ruin.

In 1929, Yvonne divorced Coty and married Leon Cotnareanu. Their divorce settlement stipulated that Coty would pay his ex-wife several millions of francs in three installments, but in 1931 Coty defaulted on the last payment, citing financial hardship. Over the next few years, divorce courts ruled in favor of Yvonne, and granted her ownership of most of Coty&#x27;s fortune and his newspapers.

He died in 1934 at his home in Louveciennes, of pneumonia and complications after an aneurysm.

In 1963, Yvonne sold Coty to pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, with the stipulation that no member of the Coty family would be involved in the company. Under Pfizer, the company began to distribute its perfumes almost exclusively through drugstores, instead of in department stores as it had previously done. In 1992, Pfizer sold Coty to the German company Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH, which owns it today.

<text>George Stepney (1663 – 15 September 1707) was an English poet and diplomat.

Stepney was the son of George Stepney, groom of the chamber to Charles II, and was born at Westminster. He was admitted on the foundation of Westminster School in 1676, and in 1682 became a scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming a fellow of his college in 1687.

Through his friend Charles Montagu, afterwards Earl of Halifax, he entered the diplomatic service, and in 1692 was sent as envoy to Brandenburg. He represented William III at various other German courts, and in 1702 was sent to Vienna, where he had already acted as envoy in 1693. In Nov 1697 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society

In 1705 Prince Eugene of Savoy requested Stepney&#x27;s withdrawal on the grounds of his alleged favouritism towards the Hungarian insurgents, but the demand was taken back at the request of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who had great confidence in Stepney. He was, nevertheless, removed in 1706 to The Hague. In the following year he returned to England in the hope of recovering from a severe illness, but died in Chelsea, London, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Stepney had a full and accurate knowledge of German affairs, and was a great letter-writer. Among his correspondents was Gottfried Leibniz, with whom he was on friendly terms. Much of his official and other correspondence is preserved in the letters and papers of Sir John Ellis (British Library Add MS 28875-28956), purchased from the Earl of Macclesfield in 1872, and others are available in the record office. He contributed a version of the eighth satire of Juvenal to the translation (1693) of the satires by John Dryden and others. Samuel Johnson, who included him in his &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;, called him a very licentious translator, and remarked that he did not recompense his neglect of the author by beauties of his own.

<text>Graphviz (short for &quot;Graph Visualization Software&quot;) is a package of open-source tools initiated by AT&amp;T Labs Research for drawing graphs (as in nodes and edges, not as in bar charts) specified in DOT language scripts having the file name extension &quot;gv&quot;. It also provides libraries for software applications to use the tools. Graphviz is free software licensed under the Eclipse Public License.

== Tools ==

; dot : a command-line tool to produce layered graph drawings in a variety of output formats, such as (PostScript, PDF, SVG, annotated text and so on).
; neato : useful for undirected graphs up to about 1000 nodes. &quot;Spring model&quot; layout minimizes global energy.
; fdp : force-directed graph drawing similar to &quot;spring model&quot;, but minimizes forces instead of energy. Useful for undirected graphs.
; sfdp : multiscale version of fdp for the layout of large undirected graphs.
; twopi : for radial graph layouts. Nodes are placed on concentric circles depending on their distance from a given root node.
; circo : circular layout. Suitable for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures, such as certain telecommunications networks.
; dotty : a graphical user interface to visualize and edit graphs.
; lefty : a programmable (in a language inspired by EZ) widget that displays DOT graphs and allows the user to perform actions on them with the mouse. Therefore, Lefty can be used as the view in a model–view–controller GUI application that uses graphs.
; gml2gv, gv2gml: convert to/from GML, another graph file format.
; graphml2gv: convert a GraphML file to the DOT format.
; gxl2gv, gv2gxl: convert to/from GXL, another graph file format.

<doc id="571325" wikidata="Q836482" url="?curid=571325" title="Sample and hold">
<text>In electronics, a sample and hold (also known as sample and follow) circuit is an analog device that samples (captures, takes) the voltage of a continuously varying analog signal and holds (locks, freezes) its value at a constant level for a specified minimum period of time. Sample and hold circuits and related peak detectors are the elementary analog memory devices. They are typically used in analog-to-digital converters to eliminate variations in input signal that can corrupt the conversion process. They are also used in electronic music, for instance to impart a random quality to successively-played notes.

A typical sample and hold circuit stores electric charge in a capacitor and contains at least one switching device such as a FET (field effect transistor) switch and normally one operational amplifier. To sample the input signal, the switch connects the capacitor to the output of a buffer amplifier. The buffer amplifier charges or discharges the capacitor so that the voltage across the capacitor is practically equal, or proportional to, input voltage. In hold mode, the switch disconnects the capacitor from the buffer. The capacitor is invariably discharged by its own leakage currents and useful load currents, which makes the circuit inherently volatile, but the loss of voltage (&quot;voltage drop&quot;) within a specified hold time remains within an acceptable error margin for all but the most demanding applications.

==Purpose==
Sample and hold circuits are used in linear systems. In some kinds of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), the input is compared to a voltage generated internally from a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The circuit tries a series of values and stops converting once the voltages are equal, within some defined error margin. If the input value was permitted to change during this comparison process, the resulting conversion would be inaccurate and possibly unrelated to the true input value. Such successive approximation converters will often incorporate internal sample and hold circuitry. In addition, sample and hold circuits are often used when multiple samples need to be measured at the same time. Each value is sampled and held, using a common sample clock.

For practically all commercial liquid crystal active matrix displays based on TN, IPS or VA electro-optic LC cells (excluding bi-stable phenomena), each pixel represents a small capacitor, which has to be periodically charged to a level corresponding to the greyscale value (contrast) desired for a picture element. In order to maintain the level during a scanning cycle (frame period), an additional electric capacitor is attached in parallel to each LC pixel to better hold the voltage. A thin-film FET switch is addressed to select a particular LC pixel and charge the picture information for it. In contrast to an S/H in general electronics, there is no output operational amplifier and no electrical signal AO. Instead, the charge on the hold capacitors controls the deformation of the LC molecules and thereby the optical effect as its output. The invention of this concept and its implementation in thin-film technology have been honored with the IEEE Jun-ichi Nishizawa Medal.
During a scanning cycle, the picture doesn&#x27;t follow the input signal. This does not allow the eye to refresh and can lead to blurring during motion sequences, also the transition is visible between frames because the backlight is constantly illuminated, adding to display motion blur.

Sample and hold circuits are also frequently found on synthesizers, either as a discrete module or as an integral component. They are used to take periodic samples of an incoming signal, typically as a source of modulation for other components of the synthesizer. When a sample and hold circuit is plugged into a white noise generator the result is a sequence of random values, which - depending on the amplitude of modulation - can be used to provide subtle variations in a signal or wildly varying random tones.

==Implementation==

To keep the input voltage as stable as possible, it is essential that the capacitor have very low leakage, and that it not be loaded to any significant degree which calls for a very high input impedance.

<doc id="571334" wikidata="Q1347238" url="?curid=571334" title="SGI Octane">
<text>The Octane series of IRIX workstations was developed and sold by SGI in the 1990s and 2000s. Octane and Octane2 are two-way multiprocessing-capable workstations, originally based on the MIPS Technologies R10000 microprocessor. Newer Octanes are based on the R12000 and R14000. The Octane2 has three improvements: a revised power supply, system board, and Xbow ASIC. The Octane2 has VPro graphics and supports all the VPro cards. Later revisions of the Octane include some of the improvements introduced in the Octane2. The codenames for the Octane and Octane2 are &quot;Racer&quot; and &quot;Speedracer&quot; respectively.

The Octane is the direct successor to the Indigo2, was succeeded by the Tezro, and its immediate sibling is the O2. SGI withdrew the Octane2 from the price book on May 26, 2004, and ceased Octane2 production on June 25, 2004. Support for the Octane2 ceased in June 2009.

Octane III was introduced in early 2010 after SGI&#x27;s bankruptcy reorganization. It is a series of Intel-based deskside systems, as a Xeon-based workstation with one or two 3U EATX trays, or as cluster servers with 10 system trays configured with up to 10 Twin Blade nodes or 20 Intel Atom Mini-ITX nodes.

==Hardware==
The Octane&#x27;s system board is designated as IP30, based on SGI&#x27;s Xtalk architecture. Xtalk does not use a system bus, but a Crossbow application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), referred to as Xbow, a dynamic crossbar switch that connects the XIO ports to the hub. One of the ports is used for the processor and memory subsystem, one is available for PCI-X expansion, and four are XIO slots (packet-based high-bandwidth bus, somewhat similar to HyperTransport). This makes it very similar to a single node of the Origin 200 system.

The XIO can be bridged to PCI-X, using a chip named BRIDGE. This bridging includes the system board (for the IOC3 multi-I/O chip, two ISP1040B SCSI controllers and RAD1 audio), MENET cards (four IOC3s) and the PCI cage (used for PCI cards in Octane). The Octane uses ARCS boot firmware, like all contemporary SGI computer systems.

===CPUs===

Processors for Octane series computers:

The Octane series has single and dual CPU modules. A second CPU cannot be added; the only option is to replace the whole CPU module.

===Memory===

The Octane supports 64 MB to 8 GB of system memory, using up to eight proprietary 200-pin DIMMs. There are two system board revisions. The first revision (part number 030-0887-003) supports 2 GB of RAM, while the second (part number 030-1467-001) allows up to 8 GB. The memory subsystem has vast reserves of bandwidth that can be directly served by the Xbow router to any XIO card.

The Octane&#x27;s memory controller was named HEART. It acts as a bridge between the processor, the memory (SDRAM) and the XIO bus.

===Graphics===
Graphics on the Octane are provided by a series of cards: SI, SI+T, SSI, MXI. These are updated XIO versions of Solid Impact (SI), High Impact (SI+T) and Maximum Impact (MXI) from the SGI Indigo2 that were internally designated as &#x27;MARDIGRAS&#x27;. The boards were accelerated and reengineered with faster geometry engine and texture modules to create their new versions: SE, SE+T, SSE, MXE. The SI/SE provides 13.5 MB of framebuffer memory and the SSE and MXE have a 27 MB framebuffer.

The &#x27;+T&#x27; indicates an additional high speed Rambus RDRAM-based texture board which gives 4 MB of texture memory, which is practically indispensable, though quite expensive and fragile. The SI/SE+T has one texture board, while the MXI/MXE has two texture boards; however, the two boards in the MXI/MXE do not double the available texture memory. It instead doubles the texture performance.

Later Octanes and Octane2&#x27;s support the SGI VPro graphics board series, designated &#x27;ODYSSEY&#x27;. The first VPro series cards were the V6 and V8. The main differentiator being that the V6 has 32 MB of RAM (unlike the MARDIGRAS option, framebuffer memory and texture memory come from the same pool) and V8 having 128 MB. Later, the V10 (32 MB) and V12 (128 MB) were introduced. The main difference with the new VPro V10/V12 series is that they had double the geometry performance of the older V6/V8. V6 and V10 can have up to 8 MB RAM allocated to textures (2X more than the textured-enabled MARDIGRAS options), while V8 and V12 can have up to 108 MB RAM used for textures.

The VPro graphics subsystem consists of an SGI proprietary chip set and associated software. The chip set consists of the buzz ASIC, pixel blaster and jammer (PB&amp;J) ASIC, and associated SDRAM.

The buzz ASIC is a single-chip graphics pipeline. It operates at 251 MHz and contains on-chip SRAM. The buzz ASIC has three interfaces:

* Host (16-bit, 400-MHz peer-to-peer XIO link)
* SDRAM (The SDRAM is 32 MB (V6 or V10) or 128 MB (V8 or V12); the memory bus operates at half the speed of the buzz ASIC.)
* PB&amp;J ASIC

As with the MARDIGRAS boards, all VPro boards support the OpenGL (MARDIGRAS is OpenGL 1.1 + SGI Extensions, and VPro upgraded support to OpenGL 1.2) and OpenGL ARB imaging extensions, allowing for hardware acceleration of numerous imaging operations at real-time rates.

===IMPACT Series===

===VPro Series===

===Audio===
Audio hardware is standard. Even without extensions they can support low-latency (3 ms input-to-output) audio streams. Alesis ADAT 8-channel, 24-bit optical ports are built-in, along with S/PDIF or AES/EBU optical and coaxial ports.

===Case===
The Octane cases are large (30x40x35 cm) and heavy (25 kg), but with no internal 5.25&quot; drive bays, so external CD-ROM drives must be connected if desired. Extensions include video I/O, audio I/O, networking, real-time video compression boards, and external storage options (through SCSI, Fiber Channel, or FireWire). Octanes can use standard PCI cards with the optional PCI cardcage (which provides one half-length and two full-length 5V 64-bit PCI slots), or a PCI to XIO adapter (known as a &#x27;shoehorn&#x27; which provides a single 3.3/5V 64-bit PCI slot). Older Octanes can be upgraded with VPro graphics however V10 and V12 graphics board require Xbow revision 1.4 and a Cherokee power supply. VPro V6 and V8 require Xbow revision 1.3 and a Cherokee power supply.

Octane skins come in three types. The original Octane has green skins with the original SGI &#x27;cube&#x27; logo. The later model Octanes have skins of the same color as the original, but with Octane2-style lettering and logos. Octane2 systems have blue skins with the modern lowercase letter-only SGI logo.

===I/O subsystem===
Octane series has two SCSI controllers that supports Ultra Wide SCSI devices. Systems can have a maximum of three internal 3.5&quot; SCSI SCA devices, using proprietary mounting sleds that are also compatible with the Origin 2000, Origin 200, and Onyx2. An external Ultra Wide SCSI port is used for connecting external devices.

===Operating systems===
The SGI Octane with IMPACT-class graphics was first supported by IRIX version 6.4. VPro-class graphics have been supported since IRIX version 6.5.10 for V6 and V8, with V10 and V12 graphics supported as of 6.5.11 (or 6.5.10 with a special driver patch).

Linux and OpenBSD have had support.

<text>3MP is a commercial radio station, broadcast from Rowville and licensed to Melbourne, Australia. Owned and operated by Ace Radio from studios in South Melbourne, it broadcasts an easy listening music format on 1377 AM and DAB+ digital radio.

==History==
===Early years===
3MP commenced transmission on 22 July 1976 from studios in the Bayside Shopping Centre, Frankston. It initially broadcast on 1380 kHz AM from a transmitter located at Rowville and, despite being based outside of the Melbourne city centre, was regarded by many listeners as Melbourne&#x27;s seventh commercial radio station, the first new commercial licence since the launch of 3XY in 1935.

The original licence holder was a consortium of businessmen and media identities and broadcast a music format of adult contemporary music blending solid gold and current top 40 records. Devised by the station&#x27;s first General Manager, Ray Bean and Operations Manager, Geoff Brown, the station aimed to target an older demographic than the then-market leading 3XY.

The first announcer heard on the station was John Burgess, with an initial presenting line-up including future &quot;Today&quot; weatherman Brian Bury and former 3LO presenter Richard Coombe. The first song played on the station was &quot;Howzat&quot; by Sherbet.

In 1978, as part of the Australian implementation of the Geneva Frequency Plan, 3MP changed frequencies from 1380 to 1377 kHz.

===AWA era===
Although the original Articles of Association prohibited any one person from owning more than 5% of the shares in 3MP&#x27;s licensee, the station was sold outright to AWA in 1980.

In January 1986, the station dropped its adult contemporary music format in favour of easy listening, which had been abandoned two weeks prior by rival 3AK. The move grew 3MP&#x27;s previously modest ratings.In October 1987, AWA sold its radio assets to Wesgo for $40 million.

===Wesgo era===
In 1993, Wesgo purchased rival station 3EE The Breeze, replacing 3EE&#x27;s format with a simulcast of 3MP. However, following complaints from Triple M, Gold FM, Fox FM and 3AW, the Australian Broadcasting Authority ruled against this, and in 1994 Wesgo launched oldies formatted Magic 693, ending the simulcast. Magic 693&#x27;s format, along with coverage of weekend AFL matches, proved successful as ratings climbed, albeit at the displacement of 3MP.

In 1995, the stations were sold to Southern Cross Broadcasting, which at the time operated 3AW and 3AK, and the newsroom used by both 3EE and 3MP closed. Southern Cross Broadcasting was made to sell two stations, including 3MP. By 1996, it was sold to Goulburn Valley Broadcasters, which operated Shepparton-based 3SR. In 2001, ownership of 3MP was transferred to Data and Commerce Limited, which owned and operated Melbourne AM station 3AK. In 2002, 3MP relocated its studios from Frankston to inner suburban Richmond where it shared facilities with 3AK.

===Pacific Star era===
====MTR and MyMP====

In December 2009, Pacific Star Network announced a joint-venture agreement with the Macquarie Radio Network, operators of Sydney talkback radio station 2GB, to supply radio programming into Melbourne. In April 2010, the joint-venture launched MTR 1377, replacing 3MP programming on 1377 AM.

The easy listening music format continued on DAB+ digital radio branded as MyMP, albeit without announcers. Announcers returned to MyMP on 13 May 2011, including Mark Johnson, John Tamb and Eddie Olek. In October 2011, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, acting on a complaint, shut down a pirate radio station operating from the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone, re-broadcasting the MyMP signal on AM radio.

In March 2012, the MTR joint-venture entered administration, and on 2 March ceased broadcasting. MyMP returned to the 1377 AM frequency shortly after.

====Return to AM====
In April 2012, MyMP was granted a power increase to better cover the northern and western areas of Melbourne – first applied for while operating as MTR. Also in 2012, MyMP introduced &#x27;lifestyle weekends&#x27;, with Phil Wall hosting &quot;My Fishing&quot; and Richard Stockman hosting &quot;My Wine &amp; Food&quot;. Former &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; host Glenn Ridge moved into weekday mornings, hosting &quot;My Melbourne&quot;.

In 2015, MyMP adopted the positioner of &quot;Melbourne&#x27;s greatest hits from the 60s, 70s &amp; 80s&quot;, and in May reverted to the 3MP brand. In July, the newsroom shared between 3MP and sister station 1116 SEN was closed, replaced with a service from Macquarie National News.

On 24 October 2016, the station relaunched as Classic Rock Radio.

====SEN+ and SEN Track====

On 13 August 2018, Classic Rock Radio was replaced with SEN+, an expansion of 1116 SEN. SEN+ was home to much of SEN&#x27;s soccer coverage, with some additional unique cricket and racing coverage. The rest of the time it repeated the main SEN station. On 27 March 2020, SEN+ relaunched as SEN Track, a horse and greyhound racing station.

On 5 June 2020, ACE Radio announced it had acquired the 3MP licence.

===Ace Radio era===
On 3 July 2020, the station was relaunched as 3MP, returning to an easy listening music format.

<doc id="571341" wikidata="Q900927" url="?curid=571341" title="DOT (graph description language)">
<text>DOT is a graph description language, developed as a part of the Graphviz project. DOT graphs are typically stored as files with the codice_1 or codice_2 filename extension — codice_1 is preferred, to avoid confusion with the codice_2 extension used by versions of Microsoft Word before 2007. codice_5 is also the name of the main program to process DOT files in the Graphviz package.

Various programs can process DOT files. Some, such as &quot;dot&quot;, &quot;neato&quot;, &quot;twopi&quot;, &quot;circo&quot;, &quot;fdp&quot;, and &quot;sfdp&quot;, can read a DOT file and render it in graphical form. Others, such as &quot;gvpr&quot;, &quot;gc&quot;, &quot;acyclic&quot;, &quot;ccomps&quot;, &quot;sccmap&quot;, and &quot;tred&quot;, read DOT files and perform calculations on the represented graph. Finally, others, such as &quot;lefty&quot;, &quot;dotty&quot;, and &quot;grappa&quot;, provide an interactive interface. The GVedit tool combines a text editor and a non-interactive viewer. Most programs are part of the Graphviz package or use it internally.

DOT is historically an acronym for &quot;DAG of tomorrow&quot;, as the successor to a DAG format and a &quot;dag&quot; program which handled only directed acyclic graphs.

== Syntax ==
=== Graph types ===
==== Undirected graphs ====

At its simplest, DOT can be used to describe an undirected graph. An undirected graph shows simple relations between objects, such as reciprocal friendship between people. The codice_6 keyword is used to begin a new graph, and nodes are described within curly braces. A double-hyphen (codice_7) is used to show relations between the nodes.

// The graph name and the semicolons are optional
graph graphname {
 a -- b -- c;
 b -- d;


==== Directed graphs ====

Similar to undirected graphs, DOT can describe directed graphs, such as flowcharts and dependency trees. The syntax is the same as for undirected graphs, except the codice_8 keyword is used to begin the graph, and an arrow (-&gt;) is used to show relationships between nodes.

digraph graphname {
 a -&gt; b -&gt; c;
 b -&gt; d;


=== Attributes ===
Various attributes can be applied to graphs, nodes and edges in DOT files. These attributes can control aspects such as color, shape, and line styles. For nodes and edges, one or more attribute–value pairs are placed in square brackets codice_9 after a statement and before the semicolon (which is optional). Graph attributes are specified as direct attribute–value pairs under the graph element, where multiple attributes are separated by a comma or using multiple sets of square brackets, while node attributes are placed after a statement containing only the name of the node, but not the relations between the dots.
graph graphname {
 // This attribute applies to the graph itself
 size=&quot;1,1&quot;;
 // The label attribute can be used to change the label of a node
 a [label=&quot;Foo&quot;];
 // Here, the node shape is changed.
 b [shape=box];
 // These edges both have different line properties
 a -- b -- c [color=blue];
 b -- d [style=dotted];
 // [style=invis] hides a node.
HTML-like labels are supported, although initially Graphviz did not handle them.&#x27;

=== Comments ===
DOT supports C and C++ style single line and multiple line comments. In addition, it ignores lines with a number sign symbol codice_10 as their first character, like many interpreted languages.

== Layout programs ==

The DOT language defines a graph, but does not provide facilities for rendering the graph. There are several programs that can be used to render, view, and manipulate graphs in the DOT language:

=== General ===

* Graphviz – a collection of CLI utilities and libraries to manipulate and render graphs into different formats like SVG, PDF, PNG etc.
**codice_5 – CLI tool for conversion between and other formats

===JavaScript===

* Canviza JavaScript library for rendering DOT files
* d3-graphviza JavaScript library based on Viz.js and D3.js that renders DOT graphs and supports animated transitions between graphs and interactive graph manipulation
* Vis.jsa JavaScript library that accept DOT as input for network graphs.
*Viz.js – a JavaScript port of Graphviz that provides a simple wrapper for using it in the browser.
* hpcc-js/wasm Graphviza fast WASM library for Graphviz similar to Viz.js

===Java===

* Gephian interactive visualization and exploration platform for all kinds of networks and complex systems, dynamic and hierarchical graphs
* Grappaa partial port of Graphviz to Java
* graphviz-javaan open source partial port of Graphviz to Java available from github.com
* ZGRViewera DOT viewer

===Other===

* Beluginga Python- &amp; Google Cloud Platform-based viewer of DOT and Beluga extensions

<doc id="571346" wikidata="Q487919" url="?curid=571346" title="The Sweet">
<text>Sweet (known as The Sweet until the early 1970s) are a British glam rock band who rose to prominence in the 1970s. Their best-known line-up consisted of lead vocalist Brian Connolly, bassist Steve Priest, guitarist Andy Scott and drummer Mick Tucker. 

The band formed in London in 1968, originally with the name the Sweetshop, and achieved their first hit, &quot;Funny, Funny&quot;, in 1971, after teaming up with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman and record producer Phil Wainman. During 1971 and 1972, their musical style showed a marked progression, from the Archies-like bubblegum style of &quot;Funny, Funny&quot; to a Who-influenced hard rock style, supplemented by a use of high-pitched backing vocals.

The band achieved success in the UK charts during the 1970, having thirteen Top 20 hits, with &quot;Block Buster!&quot; (1973) topping the chart, followed by three consecutive number-two hits: &quot;Hell Raiser&quot; (1973), &quot;The Ballroom Blitz&quot; (1973) and &quot;Teenage Rampage&quot; (1974). The band turned to a more hard rock style with their mid-career singles, such as 1974&#x27;s &quot;Turn It Down&quot;. &quot;Fox on the Run&quot; (1975) also reached number two on the UK chart. The band were popular in West Germany and other countries on the European mainland. The group achieved success in the US with the top ten hits &quot;Little Willy&quot;, &quot;The Ballroom Blitz&quot;, &quot;Fox on the Run&quot;, and &quot;Love is Like Oxygen&quot;.

Sweet had their last international success in 1978 with &quot;Love Is Like Oxygen&quot;. Connolly left the group in 1979 to start a solo career, and the remaining members continued as a trio until they disbanded in 1981. From the mid-1980s, Scott, Connolly and Priest each played with their own versions of Sweet at different times. Connolly died in 1997, Tucker in 2002 and Priest in 2020. Andy Scott is still active with his version of the band. Sweet have sold over 35 million albums worldwide.

==History==

===Origins===

The Sweet&#x27;s origins can be traced back to British soul band Wainwright&#x27;s Gentlemen. Mark Lay&#x27;s history of that band states they formed around 1962 and were initially known as Unit 4. Founding members included Chris Wright (vocals), Jan Frewer (bass), and Jim Searle and Alfred Fripp on guitars. Phil Kenton joined on drums as the band changed its name to Wainwright&#x27;s Gentlemen (due to there being another band known as Unit 4). Managed by Frewer&#x27;s father, the band performed in the Hayes, Harrow and Wembley area. By 1964 the group was also playing in London, including at the Saint Germain Club on Poland Street.

In January 1964 the band came fifth in a national beat group contest, with finals held at the Lyceum Strand on 4 May 1964. Highlights of the show were presented on BBC1 by Alan Freeman. Chris Wright left the line-up in late 1964 and was replaced by Ian Gillan. Ann Cully also joined the band as a vocalist. Mick Tucker, from Kingsbury, joined on drums replacing Phil Kenton. The band recorded a number of tracks including a cover of the Coasters-Hollies hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Just Like Me&quot;, which was probably recorded at Jackson Sound Studios in Rickmansworth. The track includes Gillan on vocals, Tucker on drums and, according to band bassist Jan Frewer, is thought to have been recorded in 1965. Gillan quit in May 1965 to join Episode Six, and later, Deep Purple. Cully remained as vocalist before departing some time later. Gillan&#x27;s and Cully&#x27;s eventual replacement, in late 1966, was Scots-born vocalist Brian Connolly, who hailed more recently from Harefield. Tony Hall had joined on saxophone and vocals and when Fripp left he was replaced by Gordon Fairminer. Fairminer&#x27;s position was eventually assumed by Frank Torpey (born Frank Edward Torpey, 30 April 1945, Kilburn, North West London) – a schoolfriend of Tucker&#x27;s who had just left West London group The Tribe (aka The Dream). Torpey only lasted a few months, and in late 1967 Robin Box (born 19 June 1944) took his place. Searle disappeared from the scene. Tucker and Connolly remained with Wainwright&#x27;s Gentlemen until January 1968, when Tucker was dismissed. Tucker was replaced by Roger Hills. When the Gentlemen eventually broke up, Hills and Box joined White Plains who eventually scored a hit with &quot;My Baby Loves Lovin&#x27;&quot;.

===Early years===

In January 1968, Connolly and Tucker formed a new band, calling themselves The Sweetshop. They recruited bass guitarist and vocalist Steve Priest from a local band called The Army. Priest had previously played with mid-&#x27;60s band the Countdowns who had been produced and recorded by Joe Meek. Frank Torpey was again recruited to play guitar. The quartet made its public debut at the Pavilion in Hemel Hempstead on 9 March 1968 and they gradually developed a following. They were managed by Paul Nicholas, who later went on to star in &quot;Hair&quot;. Nicholas worked with record producer Phil Wainman at Mellin Music Publishing who was sufficiently impressed to record them. This led to a contract with Fontana Records. Just weeks before their debut release an unrelated artist released a single under the name Sweetshop, so the band abbreviated their moniker to The Sweet. &quot;Slow Motion&quot; (July 1968), produced by Wainman, failed to chart. The Sweet were released from the recording contract and Frank Torpey left after a further year of fruitless toil. In his autobiography &quot;Are You Ready Steve&quot;, Priest says Gordon Fairminer was approached to play for them when Torpey decided to leave The Sweet after a gig at Playhouse Theatre, Walton-on-Thames, on 5 July 1969 but turned the job down as he wanted to concentrate on other interests.

===New line-up and new record deal===

Guitarist Mick Stewart joined in 1969. Stewart had some rock pedigree, having previously worked with The (Ealing) Redcaps and Simon Scott &amp; The All-Nite Workers in the mid-1960s. In late 1965, that band became The Phil Wainman Set when the future Sweet producer joined on drums and the group cut some singles with Errol Dixon. In early 1966, Stewart left and later worked with Johnny Kidd &amp; The Pirates.

The Sweet signed a new record contract with EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label. Three Bubblegum pop singles were released: &quot;Lollipop Man&quot; (September 1969), &quot;All You&#x27;ll Ever Get from Me&quot; (January 1970), and a cover version of the Archies&#x27; &quot;Get on the Line&quot; (June 1970), all of which failed to chart. Stewart then quit, and was not replaced for some time. Connolly and Tucker had a chance meeting with Wainman, who was now producing, and knew of two aspiring songwriters, Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who were looking for a group to sing some demos they had written. Connolly, Priest, and Tucker provided the vocals on a track called &quot;Funny, Funny&quot; which featured Pip Williams on guitar, John Roberts on bass, and Wainman on drums. The latter began offering the track to various recording companies. The band held auditions for a replacement guitarist and settled on Welsh-born Andy Scott. He had most recently been playing with Mike McCartney (brother of Paul) in the Scaffold. As a member of the Elastic Band, he had played guitar on two singles for Decca, &quot;Think of You Baby&quot; and &quot;Do Unto Others&quot;. He also appeared on the band&#x27;s lone album release, &quot;Expansions on Life&quot;, and on some recordings by the Scaffold. The band rehearsed for a number of weeks before Scott made his live debut with Sweet on 26 September 1970 at the Windsor Ballroom in Redcar.

The Sweet initially attempted to combine diverse musical influences, including the Monkees and 1960s bubblegum pop groups such as the Archies, with more heavy rock-oriented groups such as the Who. The Sweet adopted the rich vocal harmony style of the Hollies, with distorted guitars and a heavy rhythm section. This fusion of pop and hard rock would remain a central trademark of Sweet&#x27;s music and prefigured the glam metal of a few years later.

The Sweet&#x27;s initial album appearance was on the budget label Music for Pleasure as part of a compilation called &quot;Gimme Dat Ding&quot;, released in December 1970. Sweet had one side of the record; the Pipkins (whose sole hit, &quot;Gimme Dat Ding&quot;, gave the LP its name) had the other. The Sweet&#x27;s contribution consisted of the A- and B-sides of the band&#x27;s three Parlophone singles. Andy Scott appears in the album cover shot, even though he did not play on any of the recordings.

===First album===

The Sweet made their UK television debut in December 1970 on a pop show called &quot;Lift Off&quot;, performing the song &quot;Funny, Funny&quot;. A management deal was signed with the songwriting team of Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman. Phil Wainman resumed his collaboration with The Sweet, as executive producer. This management deal also included a worldwide record contract with RCA Records, with the exception of North America: in the United States and Canada, the band&#x27;s records were distributed by Bell Records until late 1973, followed by Capitol Records.

In March 1971, RCA issued &quot;Funny, Funny&quot;, written by Chinn and Chapman, which became the group&#x27;s first international hit, climbing to the Top 20 on many of the world&#x27;s charts. EMI reissued their 1970 single &quot;All You&#x27;ll Ever Get from Me&quot; (May 1971) and it again failed to chart. Their next RCA release &quot;Co-Co&quot; (June 1971) went to number two in the UK and their follow up single, &quot;Alexander Graham Bell&quot; (October 1971), only went to No. 33. These tracks still featured session musicians on the instruments with the quartet providing only the vocals.

The Sweet&#x27;s first full LP album, &quot;Funny How Sweet Co-Co Can Be&quot;, was released in November 1971. It contained a collection of the band&#x27;s recent singles, supplemented by some new Chinn/Chapman tunes (including &quot;Chop Chop&quot; and &quot;Tom Tom Turnaround&quot;) and pop covers (such as the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&#x27;s &quot;Daydream&quot; and the Supremes&#x27; &quot;Reflections&quot;). The album, recorded at Nova Studios in London, was produced by Phil Wainman and engineered by Richard Dodd and Eric Holland. It was not a serious contender on the charts.

===Initial success and rise to fame===
February 1972 saw the release of &quot;Poppa Joe&quot;, which reached number 1 in Sweden and Finland and peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. The next two singles of that year, &quot;Little Willy&quot; and &quot;Wig-Wam Bam&quot;, both reached No. 4 in the UK. &quot;Little Willy&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 after a re-issue in 1973, thus becoming the group&#x27;s biggest American hit. Although &quot;Wig-Wam Bam&quot; remained largely true to the style of their previous recordings, the vocals and guitars had a harder, more rock-oriented sound, largely because it was the first Chinn-Chapman single on which only members of the band played the instruments. In January 1973 &quot;Block Buster!&quot; became The Sweet&#x27;s first single to reach number 1 on the UK chart, remaining there for five consecutive weeks. After their next single &quot;Hell Raiser&quot; was released in May and reached number 2 in the UK, the band&#x27;s US label, Bell, released the group&#x27;s first American album &quot;The Sweet&quot; in July 1973.

To promote their singles, The Sweet made appearances on UK and European TV shows such as &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Supersonic&quot;. In one performance of &quot;Block Buster!&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; Christmas edition, Priest aroused complaints after he appeared replete in a German military uniform, Hitler moustache and displaying a swastika armband. The band also capitalised on the glam rock explosion, rivalling Gary Glitter, T. Rex, Queen, Slade, and Wizzard for outrageous stage clothing.

Despite The Sweet&#x27;s success, the relationship with their management was becoming increasingly tense. While they had developed a large fan-base among teenagers, The Sweet were not happy with their &#x27;bubblegum&#x27; image. The group had always composed their own usually heavy-rock songs on the B-sides of their singles to contrast with the bubblegum A-sides which were composed by Chinn and Chapman. During this time, The Sweet&#x27;s live performances consisted of B-sides, album tracks, and various medleys of rock and roll classics; they avoided older novelty hits like &quot;Funny, Funny&quot; and &quot;Poppa Joe&quot;. A 1973 performance at the Palace Theatre and Grand Hall in Kilmarnock ended in The Sweet being bottled off stage; the disorder was attributed by some (including Steve Priest) to The Sweet&#x27;s lipstick and eye-shadow look, and by others to the audience being unfamiliar with the concert set (the 1999 CD release &quot;Live at the Rainbow 1973&quot; documents a live show from this period). The incident would be immortalised in the hit &quot;The Ballroom Blitz&quot; (September 1973). In the meantime, The Sweet&#x27;s chart success continued, showing particular strength in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and Australia.

===Forming a new image===
By the end of 1973, the band&#x27;s name evolved from &quot;The Sweet&quot; to &quot;Sweet&quot;. The change would be reflected in all of their releases from 1974 onward. 

From mid 1973 to early 1974, Sweet were growing increasingly tired of the management team of Chinn and Chapman, who had written the group&#x27;s major hits and who had cultivated the band&#x27;s glam rock image, with Sweet rejecting the song Dyna-mite, which instead went on to become a hit for Mud that reached number 4 in the UK singles chart in November 1973. The band and their producer Phil Wainman, assisted by engineer Peter Coleman, recorded the album &quot;Sweet Fanny Adams&quot;, which was released in April 1974 and featured self-penned hard rock tracks such as &quot;Sweet F.A.&quot; and &quot;Set Me Free&quot;. Sweet also adopted a more conventional hard rock sound and appearance. &quot;Sweet Fanny Adams&quot; also featured compressed high-pitched backing vocal harmonies, which was a trend that continued on all of Sweet&#x27;s albums.

During sessions for the album, Brian Connolly was injured in a fight in Staines, on High Street. His throat was badly injured and his ability to sing severely limited. Priest and Scott filled in on lead vocals on some tracks (&quot;No You Don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Into The Night&quot; and &quot;Restless&quot;) and Connolly, under treatment from a Harley Street specialist, managed to complete the album. The band did not publicise the incident and told the press that subsequent cancelled shows were due to Connolly having a throat infection. This incident reportedly permanently compromised Connolly&#x27;s singing ability, with his range diminished.

No previous singles appeared on the album, and none were released, except in Japan, New Zealand and Australia, where &quot;Peppermint Twist/Rebel Rouser&quot;, apparently released by their record company without their knowledge, gained a No. 1 chart position in the latter. &quot;Sweet Fanny Adams&quot; would be Sweet&#x27;s only non-compilation release to break the UK Albums Chart Top 40.

Sweet were invited by Pete Townshend to support the Who, who were playing at Charlton Athletic&#x27;s football ground, The Valley in June 1974. However, Connolly&#x27;s badly bruised throat kept them from fulfilling the role. Sweet had frequently cited the Who as being one of their main influences and played a medley of their tracks in their live set for many years.

===&quot;Desolation Boulevard&quot;===
Their third album, &quot;Desolation Boulevard&quot;, was released later in 1974, six months after &quot;Sweet Fanny Adams&quot;. By that stage, producer Phil Wainman had moved on and the album was produced by Mike Chapman. It was recorded in six days and featured a rawer &quot;live&quot; sound. One track, &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot;, written by Elmer Bernstein and Sylvia Fine for the 1955 Frank Sinatra movie of the same name, featured drummer Mick Tucker performing an 8 and half minute solo (although this was not included in the US release). This had been a staple of the band&#x27;s live performance for years. The first single from the LP, the heavy-melodic &quot;The Six Teens&quot; (July 1974), was a Top 10 hit in the UK and still part of the amazing unbroken string of No. 1&#x27;s in Denmark. However, the subsequent single release, &quot;Turn It Down&quot; (November 1974), reached only No. 41 on the UK chart and No. 2 in Denmark. &quot;Turn It Down&quot; received minimal airplay on UK radio and was banned by some radio stations because of certain lyrical content – &quot;God-awful sound&quot; and &quot;For God sakes, turn it down&quot; – which were deemed &quot;unsuitable for family listening.&quot; The band resumed playing live shows nearly a full six months after Connolly&#x27;s throat injury, with band and critics noting a rougher edge to his voice and a reduced range. The album also featured a group composition, &quot;Fox On The Run&quot;, which was to be re-recorded months later.

The US version of &quot;Desolation Boulevard&quot; was different from the UK version and included several songs from &quot;Sweet Fanny Adams&quot; in addition to the &quot;Ballroom Blitz&quot; and &quot;Fox on the Run&quot; singles (both of which peaked at No. 5 in the US). Side One of the album contained all Chapman-Chinn penned songs, while Side Two featured songs written and produced by Sweet.

===Writing and producing their own material===

In 1975, Sweet went back into the studio to re-arrange and record a more pop-oriented version of the track &quot;Fox on the Run&quot;. Sweet&#x27;s first self-written and produced single, &quot;Fox on the Run&quot; was released worldwide in March 1975 and became their biggest selling hit, reaching number one in Australia, Germany, Denmark, and South Africa, number two in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, and the Netherlands, and number three in Austria and Switzerland. In Australia, it not only made it to the top of the chart, it also became the biggest selling single of that year, and eventually the seventh biggest seller in Australia for the entire decade. The song reached number two in Canada and number five in the US. The release of this track marked the end of the formal Chinn-Chapman working relationship and the band stressed it was now fully self-sufficient as writers and producers.

The following single release, a hard rock track called &quot;Action&quot; (July 1975), peaked at number 15 in the UK. Now confident in their own songwriting and production abilities, Sweet spent the latter half of 1975 in Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany, where they recorded the &quot;Give Us a Wink&quot; album with German sound engineer Reinhold Mack, who later recorded with Electric Light Orchestra and co-produced Queen. The new album release was deferred until 1976 so as not to stifle the chart success &quot;Desolation Boulevard&quot; was enjoying, peaking at number 25 in the US and number 5 in Canada.

With &quot;Give Us a Wink&quot; being held over, RCA issued a double album in Europe, &quot;Strung Up&quot;, in November. It contained one live disc, recorded in London in December 1973, and one disc compiling previously released singles (plus an unused track by Chinn and Chapman – &quot;I Wanna Be Committed&quot;). At the end of the year, Andy Scott released his first solo single, &quot;Lady Starlight&quot; b/w &quot;Where D&#x27;Ya Go&quot;. Tucker played drums on both tracks.

===Decline in popularity===

January 1976 saw the release of the single &quot;The Lies In Your Eyes&quot;, which made the Top 10 in Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Australia, but only reached No. 35 on the UK chart. Sweet&#x27;s first album to be fully produced and written by themselves, &quot;Give Us a Wink&quot;, was released in March 1976. A third single from the album, &quot;4th of July&quot;, was issued in Australia. All of this highlighted the band&#x27;s image change from glam to a tougher jeans and leather look.

Sweet were striving to build on their growing popularity in America, with fifty headline concert dates commencing in January 1976. Even though &quot;Give Us a Wink&quot; was released during the tour, the band&#x27;s hard rock set drew largely on the now dated &#x27;Desolation Boulevard&#x27; plus the new US hit single &quot;Action&quot;.

During an appearance at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in California on 24 March, Sweet played &quot;All Right Now&quot; with Ritchie Blackmore as a tribute to mark the death of Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, who was to have supported Sweet with his band Back Street Crawler. The US tour was not financially successful, with small audiences at many venues leading to the final half-dozen or so dates being cancelled. Following the end of the tour, the band went on to Scandinavia and Germany. The band also spent a week at the Who&#x27;s Ramport Studios in Battersea demoing material for a new album before abandoning the project and playing eight dates in Japan. By the end of the Japanese shows Connolly&#x27;s extremely hoarse singing voice was manifest evidence of the demands of constant touring and the enduring after-effects of his 1974 assault.

Between October 1976 and January 1977, Sweet wrote and recorded new material at Kingsway Recorders and Audio International London studios for their next album. An advance single from the album, &quot;Lost Angels&quot;, was only a hit in Germany, Austria and Sweden. A new album, &quot;Off the Record&quot;, was released in April. The next single from the album, &quot;Fever of Love&quot;, represented the band&#x27;s singles heading in a somewhat more Europop style with the bulk of the album continuing in a polished hard rock style. &quot;Fever of Love&quot; dented the charts in Germany, Austria and Sweden, while reaching number 10 in South Africa. On this album, Sweet again worked with &quot;Give Us a Wink&quot; engineer Louis Austin, who would later engineer Def Leppard&#x27;s &quot;On Through The Night&quot; 1980 début album. The band cancelled a US tour with emerging US rockers Aerosmith, did not play any live dates in support of the album and, in fact, did not play a single concert for the whole of 1977.

===&quot;Level Headed&quot; and a change in style===
Sweet left RCA in 1977 and signed a new deal with Polydor though it would not come into force until later in the year. Sweet&#x27;s manager David Walker, from Handle Artists, negotiated the move which was reputed to be worth around £750,000. In the United States, Canada, and Japan, Capitol had issued Sweet&#x27;s albums since 1974 and would continue to do so through to 1980.

The first Polydor album, &quot;Level Headed&quot; (January 1978), found Sweet experimenting by combining rock and classical sounds &quot;a-la clavesin&quot;, an approach similar to Electric Light Orchestra&#x27;s, and featured the single &quot;Love Is Like Oxygen&quot;. Largely recorded during 1977 at Château d&#x27;Hérouville near Paris, France after a 30-day writing session at Clearwell Castle in the Forest Of Dean UK, the album represented a new musical direction, largely abandoning hard-rock for a more melodic pop style, interspersed with ballads accompanied by a 30-piece orchestra. The ballad, &quot;Lettres D&#x27;Amour&quot;, featured a duet between Connolly and Stevie Lange (who would emerge as lead singer with the group Night in 1979).

With the addition of session and touring musicians keyboardist Gary Moberley and guitarist Nico Ramsden (Byzantium, Boys Don&#x27;t Cry), Sweet undertook a short European and Scandinavian tour followed by a single British concert at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon on 24 February 1978. However, &quot;Love Is Like Oxygen&quot; (January 1978) was their last UK, US, and German Top 10 hit. Scott was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for co-composing the song. One more single from the album, &quot;California Nights&quot; (May 1978), featuring Steve Priest as the lead vocalist, peaked at number 23 on the German chart.

===Departure of Brian Connolly===
Between March and May 1978 Sweet extensively toured the US, as a support act for Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band. The tour included a disastrous date in Birmingham, Alabama on 3 May, during which visiting Capitol Records executives in the audience saw Brian Connolly give a drunken and incoherent performance that terminated early in the set with his collapse on stage, leaving the rest of the group to play on without him. The band returned briefly to Britain before resuming the second leg of their US tour in late May supporting other acts, including Foghat and Alice Cooper. Concluding the US tour in early July 1978, Brian&#x27;s alcoholism and estrangement from the group was steadily becoming a greater issue.

In late October, having spent further time at Clearwell Castle to write for their next album, Sweet arrived at The Town House studio in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London to complete and record &quot;Cut Above the Rest&quot; (April 1979). Due to tensions between various members attributed to Connolly&#x27;s health and diminishing status with the group, his long-time friend and fellow founding member, Mick Tucker, was tasked to produce Connolly&#x27;s vocals. It was felt Tucker would extract a better performance than Scott from Connolly. A number of tracks were recorded featuring Connolly. However, these efforts were deemed unsatisfactory and Brian left the band on 2 November 1978.

On 23 February 1979, Brian Connolly&#x27;s departure from Sweet was formally announced by manager David Walker. Publicly, Connolly was said to be pursuing a solo career with an interest in recording country rock.

===Three-member Sweet===
Sweet continued as a trio with Priest assuming the lion&#x27;s share of lead vocals, though Scott and Tucker were also active in that role. The first single release for the trio was &quot;Call Me&quot;. Guest keyboard player Gary Moberley continued to augment the group on stage. Guitarist Ray McRiner joined their touring line-up in 1979, with a small tour with Journey in the eastern United States and Cheap Trick in Texas in the spring and summer of &#x27;79 to support &quot;Cut Above The Rest&quot; (which was released in April 1979). McRiner would also contribute the songs &quot;Too Much Talking&quot; and the single &quot;Give The Lady Some Respect&quot; to the next Sweet album, &quot;Waters Edge&quot; (August 1980), which was recorded in Canada. In the US, &quot;Waters Edge&quot; was titled &quot;Sweet VI&quot;. It featured the singles &quot;Sixties Man&quot; and &quot;Give The Lady Some Respect&quot;. Tragedy befell Mick Tucker when his wife Pauline drowned in the bath at their home on 26 December 1979. The band withdrew from live work for all of 1980.

One more studio album, &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, was recorded in London during 1980–81 but was only released in West Germany and Mexico. Sweet undertook a short tour of the UK and performed their last live show at Glasgow University on 20 March 1981. Steve Priest then returned to the United States, where he had been living since late 1979. When Polydor released &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; in October 1982, the original Sweet had been disbanded for almost a year.

==Re-formed versions (1984–present)==

===Andy Scott&#x27;s Sweet (1985–present)===

Andy Scott and Mick Tucker organised their own version of Sweet with Paul Mario Day (ex-Iron Maiden, More, Wildfire) on lead vocals, Phil Lanzon (ex-Grand Prix) on keyboards and Mal McNulty on bass. The band performed at the Marquee Club in London in February 1986, with the shows recorded and gaining release a few years later, bolstered by four new studio tracks including a cover of the Motown standard &quot;Reach Out I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;. This line-up also toured Australian and New Zealand pubs and clubs for more than three months in 1985 and for a similar period again in 1986. Singer Paul Day married the band&#x27;s Australian tour guide and relocated there. He continued with Sweet commuting back and forth to Europe for the group&#x27;s tours until this proved to be too cumbersome. He departed in late 1988. As McNulty moved into the front man spot, Jeff Brown came in to take over bass early in 1989. Lanzon too went back and forth between Sweet and Uriah Heep during 1986–1988 before Heep&#x27;s schedule grew too busy. Malcolm Pearson and then Ian Gibbons (who had played with The Kinks and The Records) both filled in for Lanzon until Steve Mann (Liar, Lionheart, McAuley Schenker Group) arrived in December 1989.

Tucker departed after a show in Lochau, Austria, on 5 May 1991. He later was diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia. Three drummers, Andy Hoyler, Bobby Andersen and Bruce Bisland (Weapon, Wildfire, Praying Mantis), provided short-term relief before Bodo Schopf (McAuley Schenker Group) took over. They recorded an album during this period, simply titled &quot;A&quot;. Before the band embarked on the supporting tour for &quot;A&quot; in 1992, Bodo left and Bisland returned as permanent percussionist. Scott changed the band&#x27;s name to &#x27;Andy Scott&#x27;s Sweet&#x27; after Tucker&#x27;s departure but truncated it to simply &#x27;The Sweet&#x27; once again after Tucker&#x27;s death in 2002.

Mal McNulty, now lead vocalist, departed in 1994, though he would return briefly that year to fill in for Jeff Brown on bass (as he would again in 1995 as lead singer for a few dates while Rocky Newton subbed on bass). Sweet&#x27;s former keyboard men Gary Moberley and Ian Gibbons also did fill-in jaunts with the group that year, as did Chris Goulstone. Chad Brown (ex-Lionheart; no relation to Jeff) was the new front man. &quot;Glitz Blitz and Hitz&quot;, a new studio album of re-recorded Sweet hits, was released during this period.

In 1996 Mann left to take a job in television and Gibbons came back for a short time before Steve Grant (ex-The Animals) became the permanent keyboardist. When Chad Brown quit in 1998 after developing a throat infection, Jeff Brown assumed lead vocals and bass duties. After this, the band was stable again for the next five years.

The mid-2000s brought further rotations. Tony O&#x27;Hora (ex-Onslaught, Praying Mantis) replaced Brown as lead vocalist in 2003. Ian Gibbons came back for a third stint as fill-in keyboardist in June 2005 for a gig in the Faroe Islands. O&#x27;Hora decided to split to take a teaching job in late 2005. Grant then jumped from keyboards to lead vocals and bass as Phil Lanzon returned on keyboards for a tour of Russia and Germany in October/November. New singer Mark Thompson Smith (ex-Praying Mantis) joined in November 2005 for some Swedish gigs, while Jo Burt (ex-Black Sabbath) was temporary bass player. Tony Mills (ex-Shy) was slated to be Sweet&#x27;s new singer in early 2006 but failed to work out and left after six shows in Denmark. At this point, O&#x27;Hora came back as fill in front man and then Grant did another turn himself as the singer/bassist (Steve Mann depped on keyboards) until the group finally landed a new permanent front man when Peter Lincoln (ex-Sailor) arrived in July 2006. The line-up then consisted of Scott, Bisland, Grant and Lincoln.

Scott produced the Suzi Quatro album &quot;Back to the Drive&quot;, released in February 2006. March 2006 saw the US release of his band&#x27;s album &quot;Sweetlife&quot;.

In 2007 the group played in Germany, Belgium, Austria and Italy. In May of that year, the band played in Porto Alegre and Curitiba, Brazil, their first and only South American shows. The tour was called the &#x27;Sweet Fanny Adams Tour&#x27;.

The band toured again in March 2008 under the name &#x27;Sweet Fanny Adams Revisited Tour&#x27;. In May and June, Scott&#x27;s Sweet were part of the &quot;Glitz Blitz &amp; 70s Hitz&quot; tour of the UK alongside The Rubettes and Showaddywaddy.

In March and April 2010, Scott was absent from a couple of gigs due to ill health and Martin Mickels stood in. Scott revealed later that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and was treated at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. After a course of treatment and rest, he was back to full touring fitness. In 2010 the band played at venues in Europe and back at Bilston in October.

In March 2011 there was a short tour of Australia, Regal Theatre – Perth, and Clipsal 500, Adelaide with the Doobie Brothers. Also in 2011, Tony O&#x27;Hora came back to the group, this time as keyboardist, after Grant departed.

In March 2012 the band released a new album &quot;New York Connection&quot;. Recorded in England, it comprised 11 cover versions, including the 2011 single &quot;Join Together&quot; and one revamped original recording; the 1972 B-side &quot;New York Connection&quot;. All the covers either featured &#x27;bits and pieces&#x27; of Sweet hits or other artist songs, such as a &quot;new version of the Ramones &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; [which] shared space with samples from ‘Ballroom Blitz,’ and a take on Hello’s &quot;New York Groove&quot; (made famous in the US by Ace Frehley) featured a sample from Jay-Z’s &quot;Empire State Of Mind&quot; along with other Sweet references.&quot;

On the eve of their March 2012 &quot;Join Together&quot; tour of Australia, the band undertook an acoustic performance of three tracks, &quot;New York Groove-Empire State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Blockbuster&quot; and &quot;Peppermint Twist&quot;, in front of a live audience at ABC Radio Studios in East Perth. Shows in Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Geelong, Melbourne and Sydney featured tracks from the new album for the first time.

Paul Manzi joined Sweet on their 2014 Australian tour, replacing Tony O&#x27;Hora who was absent for personal reasons. Manzi played guitar, keyboard and undertook lead vocals on &quot;Set Me Free&quot; and &quot;AC-DC&quot; as the band performed shows in regional centres, including outback Western Australia, Darwin and far-north Queensland, NSW and Victoria during February and March. The band, with O&#x27;Hora back in the ranks, returned to Australia in September 2014 as the headlining act for &quot;Rock The Boat 4&quot;. This was a cruise aboard the ship Rhapsody of the Seas which departed Sydney and took in New Caledonia and Vanuatu. The band played two gigs and various members guested with Australian veteran performers including Brian Cadd and Russell Morris and members of AC/DC, The Angels, Rose Tattoo and Skyhooks.

In June 2015 it was revealed that the band were going on a tour of the UK in late 2015 and that this tour would probably be their last.

For the 2015 summer tour dates, Paul Manzi returned to sub for Peter Lincoln. The latter duly resumed his role in the band and they continued with extensive live dates, known as the &quot;Finale&quot; tour in Germany.

In 2017 after Andy undertook an Australian visit with Suzi Quatro and Don Powell in the side outfit known as QSP, Sweet was again booked for an extensive European tour. In the years following both Tony O&#x27;Hora and Pete Lincoln departed the band. Paul Manzi returned as permanent lead vocalist in May 2019, quitting the outfit Cats in Space to do so. In October 2019 Lee Small joined as bassist and backing vocalist and Tom Cory came aboard on keyboards and guitar. Former guitarist and keyboard player Steve Mann joined for a handful of shows as a special guest. During the COVID-19 pandemic the band recorded a new album of old tracks entitled Isolation Boulevard. The band continued to tour in the UK, Scandinavia and mainland Europe. A single, ‘Changes’, featuring Andy Scott on lead vocals, was released on 30 June 2023.

Adam Booth, Andy&#x27;s guitar tech since 1998, also occasionally filled in on drums and took over that role in 2023 after Bisland&#x27;s retirement.

In November of 2024, guitarist Randall Waller (formerly of the Australian group Avion) subbed for Scott during a tour of Australia, and Jim Kirkpatrick (from FM) likewise sat in for him for some December shows in the UK.

===New Sweet, Brian Connolly&#x27;s Sweet (1984–1997)===
In 1984 Brian Connolly formed a new version of Sweet without any of the other original members. Despite recurring ill health, Connolly toured the UK and Europe with his band, &quot;Brian Connolly&#x27;s Sweet&quot;, which was then renamed to &quot;New Sweet&quot;. His most successful concerts were in West Germany, before and after reunification.

During 1987, Connolly met up again with Frank Torpey. Torpey later explained in interviews Connolly was trying to get a German recording deal. The two got on very well and Torpey subsequently invited Connolly to go into the recording studio with him, as an informal project. After much trepidation, Connolly turned up and the track &quot;Sharontina&quot; was recorded. This recording would not be released until 1998, appearing on Frank Torpey&#x27;s album &quot;Sweeter&quot;.

By July 1990, plans were made for Connolly and his band to tour Australia in November. During the long flight to Australia, Connolly&#x27;s health had suffered and he was hospitalised in Adelaide Hospital, allegedly for dehydration and related problems. The rest of the band played a show in Adelaide without him. After being released from the hospital, Connolly joined the other band members in Melbourne for a gig at the Pier Hotel, in Frankston. After several other shows, including one at the Dingley Powerhouse, Connolly and his band played a final date at Melbourne&#x27;s Greek Theatre. It was felt Connolly&#x27;s health was sufficient reason for the tour not to be extended, and some of the planned dates were abandoned. Connolly went back to England and his band appeared on The Bob Downe Christmas show on 18 December 1990.

During the early 1990s, Connolly played the European &quot;oldies&quot; circuit and occasional outdoor festivals in Europe with his band. On 22 March 1992, a heavy duty tape recorder was stolen from the band&#x27;s van whilst at a gig in the Bristol Hippodrome with Mud. It contained demos of four new songs, totalling about 20 mixes.

Legal problems were going on in the background over the use of the Sweet name between Connolly and Andy Scott. Both parties agreed to distinguish their group&#x27;s names to help promoters and fans. The New Sweet went back to being called Brian Connolly&#x27;s Sweet and Andy Scott&#x27;s version became Andy Scott&#x27;s Sweet.

In 1994, Connolly and his band played in Dubai. He appeared at the Galleria Theatre, Hyatt Regency. He also performed in Bahrain.

By this time Connolly had healed the differences with Steve Priest and Mick Tucker, and was invited to the wedding of Priest&#x27;s eldest daughter, Lisa. At the private function, for which Priest specially flew back to England, Priest and Connolly performed together.

In 1995, Connolly released a new album entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;. His partner Jean, whom he had met a few years earlier, gave birth to a son. Connolly also performed in Switzerland that year.

On 2 November 1996 British TV Network Channel 4 aired a programme &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;, which examined Connolly&#x27;s time as a pop star with Sweet, the subsequent decline in the band&#x27;s popularity, and its impact on Connolly and the other band members. The show revealed Connolly&#x27;s ill health but also that he was continuing with his concert dates at Butlins. Connolly and his band had appeared at Butlins a number of times on tour during the early 1990s.

Connolly&#x27;s final concert was at the Bristol Hippodrome on 5 December 1996, with Slade II and John Rossall&#x27;s Glitter Band Experience.

===Steve Priest&#x27;s Sweet (2008–2020)===

In January 2008, Steve Priest assembled his own version of Sweet in Los Angeles. He enlisted a guitarist Stuart Smith and L.A. native Richie Onori, Smith&#x27;s bandmate in Heaven &amp; Earth, was brought in on drums. The keyboard spot was manned by ex-Crow and World Classic Rockers alumni Stevie Stewart. Front-man and vocalist Joe Retta was brought in to round out the line-up.

After an initial appearance on L.A. rock station 95.5 KLOS&#x27;s popular Mark &amp; Brian radio programme, the &quot;Are You Ready Steve?&quot; tour kicked off at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood on 12 June 2008. The band spent the next several months playing festivals and gigs throughout the US and Canada, including Moondance Jam in Walker, Minnesota; headlining at the Rock N Resort Music Festival in North Lawrence, Ohio (near Canal Fulton); London, Ontario&#x27;s Rock the Park; another headlining gig at Peterborough&#x27;s Festival of Lights; the Common Ground Festival in Lansing, Michigan; and a benefit concert for victims of California&#x27;s wildfires at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California.

In January 2009, Sweet presented at the concert industry&#x27;s Pollstar Awards, and also played a short set at the Nokia Theatre where the event was held, marking the first time in the ceremony&#x27;s history that a band performed at the show. In addition to local gigs at the House of Blues on L.A.&#x27;s Sunset Strip and Universal CityWalk, 2009 saw the band return to Canada for sold-out shows at the Mae Wilson Theater and Casino Regina, as well as the Nakusp Music Fest and Rockin&#x27; the Fields of Minnedosa in Minnedosa, Manitoba. US festivals have included Minnesota&#x27;s Halfway Jam, Rockin&#x27; the Rivers in Montana (with Pat Travers and Peter Frampton), and two late-summer shows at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.

The new band recorded a cover version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, which was included on Cleopatra Records&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, a Fab Four tribute CD that was released on 24 March 2009.

A preview of the band&#x27;s new CD &quot;Live in America&quot;, which was recorded live at the Morongo Casino, Resort &amp; Spa in Cabazon, California on 30 August 2008, was featured on KLOS&#x27;s &quot;Front Row&quot; programme on 12 April 2009. The CD, which was first sold at shows and via the band&#x27;s on-line store, was released worldwide in an exclusive deal with Amazon.com on 21 July 2009. The release has garnered favourable reviews from The Rock n Roll Report, Classic Rock Revisited and Hard Rock Haven, among others.

In April 2010, the band released its first single on iTunes: an updated, hard rock version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There.&quot; Performances on the 2010 summer tour included the Wildflower! Arts and Music Festival in Richardson, Texas; Las Vegas, Nevada&#x27;s Fremont Street Experience; Rock N&#x27; America in Oklahoma City, OK; Summer Jam in Des Moines, Iowa; Jack FM&#x27;s Fifth Show at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Los Angeles; an appearance at the Hard Rock Hotel in Biloxi, Mississippi; and the inaugural edition of the Thunder Mountain Rock Festival in Sawyer, North Dakota.

On 11 November 2010, it was announced that in May 2011 &quot;Steve Priest&#x27;s Sweet&quot; had been booked to perform at a handful of European dates, but the gigs ultimately had to be cancelled in late January 2011 after it was learned that one of the promoters was a suspected swindler wanted by British law enforcement officials. 

The band toured South America along with Journey during March 2011.

As of 12 August 2012, Stuart Smith resigned from the guitar post in order to dedicate more time to his &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; project.

Beginning with the band&#x27;s October 2012 appearance at the Festival Internacional Chihuahua in Mexico, Los Angeles-based guitarist Ricky Z. teamed up with Steve Priest and company for their live performances. In February 2013, this line-up returned to Casino Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada. Tour dates played in summer 2013 included Riverfest in Watertown, Wisconsin, the St. Clair, MI Riverfest, several additional dates in Canada, and a reprise of their appearances at both Moondance Jam in Walker, MN and Rockin&#x27; the Rivers in Three Forks, Montana. The band made some rare appearances on the US east coast in July 2013, including a performance with David Johansen of the New York Dolls at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in Englewood, New Jersey. Singer Joe Retta was unavailable for these dates due to a scheduling conflict, so Tribe of Gypsies frontman Chas West, who has played with Jason Bonham&#x27;s band and has experience subbing with Foreigner, Lynch Mob and Diamond Head, stepped in to man the microphone for a series of shows in New York, New Jersey and Maryland.

On 27 August 2014, Steve Priest announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that guitarist Mitch Perry would be joining him to play guitar. Most recently on tour with Lita Ford, Mitch&#x27;s other credentials included his work with Michael Schenker Group, Asia Featuring John Payne, Edgar Winter, Billy Sheehan and David Lee Roth His first live appearance with Sweet was at the Rock the River festival in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on 23 August 2014.

22 December 2017 saw the launch of the 50th anniversary tour at the Whisky a Go Go on L.A.&#x27;s Sunset Strip and the introduction of new singer Paul Zablidowski AKA &quot;Paulie Z&quot; former lead singer and guitarist of ZO2, children&#x27;s band &quot;The Z Brothers&quot; and star of IFC show Z-Rock. Recently known as the host for local show &quot;Ultimate Jam Night.&quot; Z replaced Joe Retta, who had served as the frontman for the Los Angeles incarnation of Sweet since its formation in 2008. Priest died on 4 June 2020.

==Brief reunions and the deaths of Connolly, Tucker and Priest==
Steve Priest was asked to join Tucker and Scott for the 1985 Australian tour, but declined.

Mike Chapman contacted Connolly, Priest, Scott, and Tucker in 1988, offering to finance a recording session in Los Angeles. As he remembers: &quot;I met them at the airport and Andy and Mick came off the plane. I said, &#x27;Where&#x27;s Brian?&#x27; They said, &#x27;Oh, he&#x27;s coming.&#x27; All the people had come off the plane by now. Then this little old man hobbled towards us. He was shaking, and had a ghostly white face. I thought, &#x27;Oh, Jesus Christ.&#x27; It was horrifying.&quot; Reworked studio versions of &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;The Ballroom Blitz&quot; were recorded, but it became clear that Connolly&#x27;s voice and physical health had made Sweet&#x27;s original member comeback too difficult to promote commercially. Consequently, the reunion attempt was aborted.

In 1990 this line-up was again reunited for the promotion of a music documentary entitled &quot;Sweet&#x27;s Ballroom Blitz&quot;. This UK video release, which contained UK television performances from the 1970s and current-day interviews, was released at Tower Records, London. Sweet were interviewed by Power Hour, Super Channel, and spoke of a possible reunion.

Brian Connolly died at the age of 51 on 9 February 1997, from liver failure and repeated heart attacks, attributed to his abuse of alcohol in the 1970s and early 1980s. Mick Tucker died on 14 February 2002 from leukaemia, at the age of 54. On 4 June 2020 it was announced that Steve Priest had died. This left Andy Scott as the sole living member of Sweet&#x27;s &quot;classic line-up&quot;.

==Later years==
Two versions of Sweet were active with original members: &quot;Andy Scott&#x27;s Sweet&quot;, who frequently tour across Europe as Sweet and makes occasional sojourns to other markets including regular visits to Australia, and &quot;Steve Priest&#x27;s Sweet&quot; who toured the US and Canada.

On 28 April 2009, Shout! Factory released a two-disc, career-spanning greatest hits album called &quot;&quot;. It received a four-star (out of five) rating in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In an October 2012 appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot;, Axl Rose, lead singer of Guns N&#x27; Roses, referenced Sweet as one of his favourite bands growing up along with fellow British band Queen.

<text>3AW is a talkback radio station based in Melbourne, Australia, owned by Nine Entertainment. It broadcasts on 693 kHz AM. It began transmission on 22 February 1932 as Melbourne&#x27;s fifth commercial radio station.

== History ==
3AW was established when a company formed by Allans Music, JC Williamson&#x27;s and David Syme (then publishers of &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper) was granted a radio broadcasting licence, with the first broadcast on 22 February 1932. The A in 3AW comes from the names of &quot;Allans&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot;; and the W is from &quot;J. C. Williamson&quot;.

It is the only one of Melbourne&#x27;s original eight stations that has retained its original name. (In comparison, Sydney, the only other Australian city with eight original stations had, until 2022, five of them still using their original names, but there are now only three such stations, namely 2GB, 2SM, 2UE.)

3AW has consistently appeared high in ratings surveys.

In 1931/1932, 3AW was one of two organisations that applied for a licence for a new Melbourne radio station; the other contender being the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne. At the time, the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department was responsible for the issuing of all radio station licences, and it came out in favour of the 3AW application on the grounds that it had recently issued a licence to 2SM Sydney, on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church. However, a condition was placed on the 3AW licence to the effect that they had to provide one hour of free broadcasting to the Roman Catholic Church, at a time decided upon by the Church; hence &quot;The Catholic Hour&quot; was broadcast every Sunday night at was then a peak listening time, namely 9.00pm.

The fact that &quot;The Catholic Hour&quot; was originally broadcast in peak listening time is emphasised by the fact the program was preceded by two of Australia&#x27;s most listened-to programs, namely Quiz Kids and Caltex Radio Theatre 

In latter years, the nostalgia program &quot;Remember When&quot; was broadcast both prior to, and after &quot;The Catholic Hour&quot;. Therefore, in the 1990s (confirmation needed) 3AW management, ignorant of its history, decided to scrap &quot;The Catholic Hour&quot; and let &quot;Remember When&quot; continue right through the evening. Not surprisingly, the Church objected and the Australian Communications and Media Authority was called in to adjudicate. Their compromise decision was that the program should continue, but that the time should be decided upon by 3AW rather than by the Church. Not surprisingly 3AW moved the program to an hour that had the least listeners of every time in the week; namely midnight to 1.00am on Sunday mornings. This meant that there were hardly any listeners to the program and, within just a few months, the Church scrapped &quot;The Catholic Hour&quot; altogether!

In 1938 the Macquarie Broadcasting Service was formed, with stations right across Australia, including 3AW in Melbourne. In 2015 the Macquarie Media Group was acquired by Fairfax Media and the name was changed to Nine Radio under which it currently operates.

3AW&#x27;s first studio was situated in His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre from whence it broadcast from 1932 to 1935.

The 3AW studios are now located at Media House, 655 Collins Street, Melbourne where it shares facilities with Magic 1278, the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot; newspapers. After moving from their original studios at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, the station was re-sited at 382 Latrobe Street, where it remained for most of the next 55 years. However, during renovations at 382 Latrobe Street, 3AW moved into the former premises of the ABC in Melbourne Place, a laneway off Russell Street, near Little Collins Street, which is now the premises of the Kelvin Club. Then, from 1991 until March 2010, the station broadcast from studios located at Bank Street, South Melbourne.

3AW&#x27;s original broadcast frequency was 1425 kHz and changed to 1280 kHz on 1 September 1935 as part of a national reshuffle of the radio broadcasting spectrum. On 23 November 1978 the station changed to 1278 kHz with the introduction of 9 kHz spacing on the AM band. Due to poor reception problems, at 7:15 am on 1 May 2006, 3AW swapped with its sister station Magic to its present frequency of 693 kHz. The station&#x27;s broadcast signal originates from a transmitter in Werribee.

In the 1950s, 3AW purchased 3CV in Maryborough in Central Victoria, which the &quot;CV&quot; nomenclature represents. For many years, 3AW programming was broadcast on 3CV after about 6.00pm.

== Broadcasters ==
* Darren James has hosted weekend morning programs for 34 years

* Ross Stevenson has been at the station for 32 years.

A number of people spent many years at 3AW in the past. Most of these are on the &quot;3AW presenters&quot; list (see &quot;External Links&quot; below). They include:
* Philip Brady was with the station for 35 years (1971, 1990–2025) hosting &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;Remember When&quot; with Bruce Mansfield and Simon Owens. 
* Neil Mitchell was with the station for 36 years (1987–2023) and filled a number of roles and hosted &quot;Mornings&quot; for 34 years. On 1 September 2023, Mitchell announced that he would retire on 1 December 2023 and this has occurred. (3AW announced that Tom Elliott, Tony Moclair and Jacqueline Felgate will host &quot;Mornings&quot;, &quot;Afternoons&quot; and &quot;Drive&quot; from January 2024 following Neil Mitchell&#x27;s retirement.)
* David McGee who spent 31 years at 3AW, 1955–1986 
* Geoff Manion&#x27;s 29 years (1956–1985), 
* Martha Gardener who was at the station for 30 years, from 1952 to 1982
* Norman Banks, 26 years, 1952–1978
* Football commentator Rex Hunt was with the station from 1989–2009 and again 2017–2021
* The Revd. Alex Kenworthy presented the &quot;Nightline&quot; program for 20 years, 1971–1991
* Fred Tupper was responsible for sporting and general programming, including the &quot;Nicky &amp; Tuppy&quot; breakfast session, during his 21 years at the station, 1933–1954
* One of 3AW&#x27;s announcers when the station commenced in 1932 was John Masters who presented a request program, &quot;Choice of the People&quot; for many years. 30 minute segments of &quot;Choice of the People&quot; were broadcast at various times throughout the day. A photo in the 1987 history of the station shows that he was a member of the original 1932 broadcasting staff; and then there is a website that highlights the fact that he was still broadcasting in 1951, 19 years later; memories from listeners (not substantiated) show that his career continued for over a decade after that 
* Peter James (father of Darren James) was with the station for at least 18 years (1959–1987), although some sources suggest that he was with the station for at least 20 years. 
* Derryn Hinch broadcast at a number of radio and television stations and was at 3AW from 1979 to 1987, 2000–2001 and again from 2003 to 2012, a total of 23 years. However, he was often off the air (particularly during his last stint) due to suspension, poor health and house arrest.
* Harry Beitzel was a football commentator on 3AW for 17 years, from 1972 to 1989, and in 2005 he rejoined 3AW as a semi-regular contributor to Rex Hunt&#x27;s pre-match show.

* Clifford Nicholls Whitta, or Nicky Whitta, usually referred to as &quot;Nicky Nicholls&quot; or simply &quot;Nicky&quot;, was at 3AW from 1932 to 1946. Whilst he may not have been at 3AW for as long a period as that of some of his confreres, he played an important role at the station. He presented the &quot;Nicky and Tuppy&quot; breakfast session with Fred Tupper (see above), and was also the name behind the extremely popular children&#x27;s session which commenced in 1933. His partner in the children&#x27;s session was Kathleen Lindgreen who broadcast under the name &quot;Nancy Lee&quot;. In 1935 Nicky and Kathleen Lindgreen were married.

During the 1950s, 60s &amp; 70s, most Melbourne commercial radio stations conducted annual appeals for a specific charity. In 3AW&#x27;s case, every Mother&#x27;s Day, an appeal was conducted for the Royal Women&#x27;s Hospital, with donations acknowledged on air. In latter years, former announcer Ray Chapman had control of the appeal as a full-time paid position with 3AW.

=== Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital ===
The annual Good Friday appeal for the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital Melbourne commenced in 1931, and was a minor event with small sums raised each year. However, when 3DB became involved in 1942, and began acknowledging donations on air, the amounts raised increased in one year by about 800%. 3DB and its successors 3TT and 101.1 TT-FM continued to support the appeal for a few years. However, 3AW has been the radio outlet for the appeal for a number of years now. 3AW works closely on the appeal with the main media outlet HSV 7.

== Technical innovations ==
In April 2007, 3AW introduced cameras into their main studio so that fans, via the 3AW website, can watch the program being broadcast, as well as listen. The cameras do not operate during news services, commercial breaks, or outside broadcasts.

In August 2009, 3AW &quot;went digital&quot;, offering a superior quality sound and other features, for those with digital receivers. Stations utilising the digital signal can also offer multi-channels and interactive features. The digital format used in Australia is DAB+, reportedly a superior technology to other digital formats. the digital signal is not rebroadcast in road tunnels like the AM signal and does not have the distance range of AM.

In October 2011 (iPhone) and mid-2012 (Android), 3AW introduced an application (App) for smartphones or tablets. The application allows users to listen to the current program, read or listen to current news articles, get weather updates, contact the station via phone, email, Twitter or Facebook and also has an alarm clock feature.

== 3AW Football (AFL) ==
&quot;3AW Football&quot; is the brand under which 3AW broadcasts Australian rules football and the station broadcasts football on all AFL match days.

3AW Football dates back to 1953, and legendary commentators such as Norman Banks and Harry Beitzel have spent time calling games at 3AW. Rex Hunt called football at 3AW for 21 years before moving to rival Triple M in 2010.

Matthew Lloyd and Dr Peter Larkins joined 3AW Football in 2012. The team for 2013 also had a number of changes,
Stephen Quartermain called on weekends, alongside either Tim Lane or Tony Leonard and the expert commentators. Cameron Ling has an expert commentary role interchangeably on Friday nights, Saturday afternoons and Sunday afternoons.

2014 saw the departure of Stephen Quartermain, and the recruitment of Nathan Brown as a ball-by-ball commentator for Saturday night and Sunday twilight matches.

== Cricket ==
On 1 November 2013, 3AW&#x27;s parent company, Fairfax Radio Network (FRN), announced that it had signed a five-year non-exclusive contract commencing with the 2013/2014 Australian cricket season, to broadcast the Boxing Day and Sydney Test matches, all One Day Internationals, the Big Bash League (BBL) and International T20 matches on network stations including 3AW. Subsequently, in December 2013, FRN decided on an earlier start to their coverage by including the Perth test match which commenced on 13 December 2013. Fairfax stated that &quot;Fairfax Radio Network will bring to its coverage more than 60 years&#x27; experience of broadcasting sport, assembling a star-studded commentary line up&quot;. The coverage will provide a ball-by-ball commentary of all broadcast matches.

The commentary team is anchored by Tim Lane and Bruce Eva, together with a panel consisting of the following experts

* Ian Chappell
* Allan Border
* Dean Jones
* Damien Fleming
* Michael Vaughan
* Henry Blofeld
* Greg Matthews
* Greg Blewett
* Mickey Arthur
* Darren Lehmann
* Glenn McGrath

== Horse Racing ==
During his years at 3AW, 1933–1954, Fred Tupper (see above) provided sporting coverage, particularly horse racing.

== Station ratings and market position ==
In the sixth ratings survey for 2014, released 30 September 2014, 3AW came first with a 13.8% market share followed by ABC Radio Melbourne with 11.4% and Fox FM with 8.2%. In this survey 3AW won every timeslot.

In the fifth ratings survey for 2014, released 26 August 2014, 3AW came first with a 14% market share followed by ABC Radio Melbourne with 12% and Fox FM with 8.0%.

In the fourth survey, 3AW lost its No. 1 station rating, scoring a 13.0% market share against ABC Radio Melbourne&#x27;s 13.4% share with Gold 104.3 FM third on 7.4%.

In the first survey for 2014, released on 11 March 2014, 3AW was the No. 1 station scoring an 11.9% market share followed by ABC Radio Melbourne&#x27;s 10.6% share with Fox FM third on 8.5%. This survey was also the first for new ratings supplier GfK Group, the company that has taken over the running of surveys from Nielsen ratings which produced the surveys for 66 years.

The final ratings survey for 2013 and the last to be conducted by Nielsen, saw 3AW complete five years as Melbourne&#x27;s number one radio station with 40 consecutive survey wins.

== Controversies ==
Mary Hardy and Geoff Manion (see above) presented the afternoon program in the 1960s. Brian McFarlane&#x27;s biography of Mary Hardy notes that she committed suicide in January 1985 by shooting herself. 

In 1999, presenter Bruce Mansfield was sacked after it emerged that he had received benefits in exchange for giving favourable comments and interviews to companies on-air without proper prior disclosure. He returned to the station as its night-time presenter in 2001.

Former presenter Steve Price was tricked into accepting fake ecstasy tablets pressed with &quot;3AW&quot; from comedian John Safran as part of Safran&#x27;s television show.

John Blackman died on 4 June 2024 after a very high profile and often contentious T.V. and radio career. On T.V. he was particularly known for his work on Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday. However, he also had a prominent and controversial radio career, including work at 3AW. From 1981, he presented the top rating breakfast program with Paul Barber. However, Blackman was forced to leave AW under questionable circumstances on 30 April 1986.

<doc id="571349" wikidata="Q815748" url="?curid=571349" title="L'Équipe">
<text>L&#x27;Équipe (, French for &quot;the team&quot;) is a French nationwide daily newspaper devoted to sport, owned by Éditions Philippe Amaury. The paper is noted for coverage of association football, rugby, motorsport, and cycling. Its predecessor, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, was founded by wealthy conservative industrialists to undermine &quot;Le Vélo&quot;, which they found too progressive. It was a general sports paper that also covered the auto racing which was gaining popularity at the turn of the twentieth century. 

&quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; launched the Tour de France road cycling stage race in 1903 as a circulation booster. The race leader&#x27;s yellow jersey () was instituted in 1919, reflecting the distinctive yellow newsprint on which &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; was published. 

The European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup, the competition that would later be rebranded as the UEFA Champions League, was also the brainchild of a &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; journalist, Gabriel Hanot. The participating clubs in the first season were selected by &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; on the basis that they were representative and prestigious clubs in Europe.

==History==

===&quot;L&#x27;Auto-Vélo&quot;===

&quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; traces its origins to opposition to &quot;Le Vélo,&quot; a sports newspaper which began publishing in 1892. In addition to covering cycling, the paper also organized cycling races. &quot;Le Vélo&quot; took a Dreyfusard position on the Dreyfus affair which boosted the paper&#x27;s sales.

As the scandal developed, French society and media became increasingly polarized. Divisions within &quot;Le Vélo&quot; on whether Dreyfus was guilty lead to its dissolution. &quot;Le Vélo&quot; began to adopt a pro-Dreyfus stance and allied with Dreyfusards. Its editor, Pierre Giffard, believed Dreyfus innocent and said so, leading to acrid disagreement with his conservative main advertisers. These included the automobile-maker Comte de Dion and industrialists Adolphe Clément and Édouard Michelin.

Frustrated at Giffard&#x27;s politics, they planned a rival paper, &quot;L&#x27;Auto-Vélo&quot; which began publishing in 1900. The editor was a prominent racing cyclist, Henri Desgrange, who had published a book of cycling tactics and training and was working as a publicity writer for Clément. Desgrange was a strong character but lacked confidence, so much doubting the Tour de France founded in his name that he stayed away from the pioneering race in 1903 until it looked like being a success.

===&quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;===

Three years after the foundation of &quot;L&#x27;Auto-Vélo&quot; in 1900, a court in Paris decided that the title was too close to its main competitor, Giffard&#x27;s &quot;Le Vélo&quot;. Thus reference to &#x27;Vélo&#x27; was dropped and the new paper became simply &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;. It was printed on yellow paper because Giffard used green.

Circulation was sluggish, however, and only a crisis meeting called &quot;to nail Giffard&#x27;s beak shut&quot;, as Desgrange phrased it, came to its rescue. Then, on the first floor of the paper&#x27;s offices in the rue du Faubourg-Montmartre in Paris, a 26-year-old cycling and rugby writer called Géo Lefèvre suggested a race round France, bigger than any other paper could rival and akin to six-day races on the track.

The Tour de France proved a success for the newspaper; circulation leapt from 25,000 before the 1903 Tour to 65,000 after it; in 1908 the race boosted circulation past a quarter of a million, and during the 1923 Tour it was selling 500,000 copies a day. The record circulation claimed by Desgrange was 854,000, achieved during the 1933 Tour.

Desgrange died in 1940 and ownership passed to a consortium of Germans. The paper began printing comments favourable to the occupying Nazis. When the Germans were finally defeated in 1945, the provisional French government forcibly dissolved the paper alongside other publications that printed pro-Nazi propaganda during the occupation. 

===&quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;===
In 1940 Jacques Goddet (1905–2000) succeeded Desgrange as editor and nominal organiser of the Tour de France (although he refused German requests to run it during the war, see Tour de France during the Second World War). Jacques Goddet was the son of &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;&#x27;s first financial director, Victor Goddet. Goddet defended his paper&#x27;s role in a court case brought by the French government but was never wholly cleared in the public mind of being close to the Germans or to the Head of the French State, Philippe Pétain (1856–1951).

Goddet could point, however, to clandestine printing of Resistance newspapers and pamphlets in the &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; print room and so was allowed to publish a successor paper called &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;. It occupied premises across the road from where &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; had been, in a building that had actually been owned by &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, although the original paper&#x27;s assets had been sequestrated by the state. One condition of publication imposed by the state was that &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; was to use white paper rather than yellow, which was too closely attached to &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;.

The new paper published three times a week from 28 February 1946. Since 1948 it has been published daily. The paper benefited from the demise of its competitors, &quot;L&#x27;Élan&quot;, and &quot;Le Sport&quot;. Its coverage of car racing hints at the paper&#x27;s ancestry by printing the words &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; at the head of the page in the gothic print used in the main title of the prewar paper.

&quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; is published in tabloid format.

===Émilien Amaury===

In 1968 &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; was bought by Émilien Amaury (1909–1977), founder of the Amaury publishing empire. Among &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;&#x27;s most respected writers have been Pierre Chany (1922–1996), Antoine Blondin (1922–1991) and Gabriel Hanot (1899–1968).

===Philippe Amaury – &quot;Éditions Philippe Amaury&quot;===

The death of Émilien Amaury in 1977 led to a six-year legal battle over inheritance between his son and daughter. This was eventually settled amicably with Philippe Amaury owning the dailies while his sister owned magazines such as &quot;Marie-France&quot; and &quot;Point de Vue&quot;. Philippe then founded &quot;Éditions Philippe Amaury&quot; (&quot;EPA&quot;), which included &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, &quot;Le Parisien&quot; and &quot;Aujourd&#x27;hui&quot;. At Philippe&#x27;s death in 2006, the group passed to his widow, Marie-Odile, and their children.

<doc id="571355" wikidata="Q4581924" url="?curid=571355" title="Environmental Assessment Institute">
<text>The Environmental Assessment Institute (EAI) ( – IMV) was an independent body under the Danish Ministry of the Environment. It was established in February 2002 by the Liberal/Conservative Danish Government with the task of making environmental and economic cost/benefit analyses. The EAI&#x27;s first Director was political scientist Bjørn Lomborg.

The EAI was seen by some as a vehicle created for Lomborg, whose book &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; argues that many perceived environmental problems are vastly exaggerated by environmental lobby and that policy responses based on such exaggerated claims are often misguided. 
The Government appointed Ole P. Kristensen, an ex-professor at the institute where Lomborg worked, as the first Director of the Board. His job was to find the director and the other board members. Lomborg was soon announced as the director.

The EAI began operating on 1 June 2002.

The EAI published a series of reports on environmental issues, from the value of a deposit/return system for drink cans to global warming. Most of them are in Danish. A report from October 2002 made an economic cost-benefit analysis of deposits on disposable bottles and cans. It concluded that it would be better to abandon the deposit system and to let the bottles and cans be burned together with other household garbage. However, it turned out afterwards that many of the Danish incineration plants operate at temperatures at which aluminum cans will not burn, but only melt, and that the cans would pose a great economic problem for them.

A committee was formed in March 2003 to evaluate the reports issued by the EAI during the second half of 2002. This committee was composed of one Danish member and four experts from Sweden and Norway. The committee adjudged the first three reports published in 2002 as superficial attempts to focus attention on the EAI. The other reports were adjudged appealing to the public, but the committee was not confident in the conclusions of two reports and in general criticized the cost-benefit analyses.

In November 2003, five out of the seven board members resigned on the same day. Three of them did so because of disagreement about the Institute&#x27;s involvement in the Copenhagen Consensus project, the others did so because of lack of time and conflicts of interest.

In mid-June 2004, there was some stir in the Danish printed media because it was revealed that criticism of Lomborg’s book from Danish climate experts had been repressed for years by the head of the EAI (Lomborg). Lomborg resigned as director on 1 August 2004.

From 1 July 2007 the Environmental Assessment Institute was changed into a department of the Danish Economic Council, and thus no longer exists as a separate institute.

<doc id="571357" wikidata="Q5077582" url="?curid=571357" title="Charles Fairburn">
<text>Charles Edward Fairburn (5 September 1887 – 12 October 1945) was an English electrical engineer whose work mainly concerned rail transport.

Born in Bradford in 1887, and educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, his career included railway electrification work undertaken in the 1910s at the &quot;Siemens Brothers Dynamo Works Ltd.&quot;, then similar work at English Electric in the 1920s where he also was involved in electric traction development work. In 1934 he joined the London, Midland and Scottish Railway where he was responsible for the introduction of new classes of diesel-electric shunting locomotives - he became Chief Mechanical Engineer of the company in the 1940s, but died in 1945 aged 58.

==Biography==
Charles Edward Fairburn was born on 5 September 1887 in Bradford. After an education at Bradford Grammar School he won a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford University where he studied mathematics and engineering, and obtained a first class degree. After college he served two years under the tutelage of Henry Fowler at the Derby Works of the Midland Railway. He studied technical drawing at Derby, and metallurgy at Sheffield, obtaining an MA in 1912.

Fairburn&#x27;s career then began in 1912 at the Siemens Brothers dynamo works (&quot;Siemens Brothers Dynamo Works Ltd.&quot;) in Stafford, where he worked in the railway engineering department; he was an assistant engineer on the Shildon-Newport electrification of the North Eastern Railway (see Railway electrification in Great Britain), being responsible for the design of overhead line electrification equipment and introduction of electric locomotives.

In 1914 he married Eleanor Cadman of Bradford.

During World War I Fairburn served in the Royal Flying Corps in an experimental squadron, where he was involved in the development of dive bomber aircraft using the Sopwith Camel, also developing night, formation and cloud flying, and organising training in those subjects. In 1919 he joined English Electric and developed their railway electrification department; by 1931 he had risen to chief engineer of the traction department, having been involved in electrification schemes on the Southern Railway, the New Zealand Government Railways, the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the London Post Office Railway, and the Danske Statsbaner. He collaborated with Kálmán Kandó of the Ganz Works in Hungary.

In 1934 Fairburn joined the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) as Chief Electrical Engineer. In 1938 he was appointed Deputy Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) under William Stanier. He was responsible for the introduction of diesel-electric shunters onto the LMS, creating types that would form the basis of over 1400 shunters used by British Railways.

Fairburn was made Acting CME of the LMS when Stanier was called away on war work in 1942 at the Ministry of Production and became CME in 1944, on Stanier&#x27;s retirement.

In 1945 he introduced the LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T, a modified version of the LMS Stanier 2-6-4T with a shortened wheelbase, and made proposals for the first mainline diesel locomotives which were carried out under his successor H.G. Ivatt. (see also LMS 10000)

Fairburn died of a heart attack aged 58 on 12 October 1945. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor, with whom he had had two children.

<text>Henry George Ivatt (4 May 1886 – 4 October 1972), known as George Ivatt, was the post-war Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. He was the son of the Great Northern Railway locomotive engineer Henry Ivatt. George Ivatt was born in Dublin, Ireland, and educated at Uppingham School, England. He married Dorothy Sarah Harrison (1881-1962) in 1913.

==Career==
In 1904, he started an apprenticeship at the Crewe Works of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). After working in the drawing office, he became head of experimental locomotive work. He was appointed as Assistant Foreman at Crewe North Shed in 1909,
and a year later became Assistant Outdoor Machinery Superintendent.

===North Staffordshire Railway===
During the 1914–1918 World War I Ivatt served on the staff of the Director of Transport in France. After the war, he became Assistant Locomotive Superintendent of the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) at Stoke-on-Trent in 1919.

===London, Midland and Scottish Railway===


Under the Railways Act 1921, the NSR was absorbed (in 1923) into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). He was transferred to Derby Works in 1928 and appointed Locomotive Works Superintendent in 1931. At the end of 1932 Ivatt moved to Glasgow, becoming Divisional Mechanical Engineer, Scotland. He returned to England in 1937 as Principal Assistant for Locomotives to the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME), William Stanier.

Stanier retired in 1944 and was succeeded as CME by Charles Fairburn. When Fairburn died suddenly in October 1945, a new shortlist was prepared and George Ivatt, the senior candidate, with significant LMS locomotive experience, was appointed CME on 1 February 1946. Robert Riddles, the other notable candidate for the post, was promoted to the board as Vice-President of the LMS.

As CME in post-war austerity Britain, Ivatt continued to build standard existing LMS locomotive types for which parts were readily available. Two additional LMS Princess Coronation Class 4-6-2 express locomotives were built and several modified Black Fives and the work of &#x27;rebuilding&#x27; the Royal Scot and Patriot classes continued. The LMS Ivatt Class 4 2-6-0 was introduced as well as the notable &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 and LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2T, built to replace life expired 19th century branch line 0-6-0 and motor train 2-4-2T locomotive types, and the Class WT 2-6-4T locomotives for the Northern Counties Committee. The famous Ivatt twins, diesel-electric locomotives numbered 10000 and 10001, built by the LMS at Derby in association with English Electric were Britain&#x27;s first main-line diesel locomotives and were designed to operate singly or in pairs.

===British Railways===
On nationalisation in 1948, Riddles became CME of British Railways, whilst Ivatt remained as CME of the London Midland Region until his retirement in 1951.

===Brush Bagnall Traction===
From mid-1951 Ivatt was a consultant and director of Brush Bagnall Traction, later becoming their General Manager. He retired as a director in 1957 but was retained as a consultant until 1964. Following the demise of Brush Bagnall Traction, Ivatt became a director of Brush Traction where he was involved with the building of the Brush Type 2 locomotives.

<text>TF1 (; standing for &quot;Télévision Française 1&quot;) is a French commercial television network owned by TF1 Group, controlled by the Bouygues conglomerate. TF1&#x27;s average market share of 24% makes it the most popular domestic network.

TF1 is part of the TF1 Group of mass media companies, which also includes the news channel LCI. It previously owned the satellite TV provider TPS, which was sold to Canal+ Group.

The network is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HBBTV) initiative, promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of terrestrial TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface.

== History ==
=== First years ===
The government operated the sole television channel in France for 28 years. It was created as Radio-PTT Vision on 26 April 1935, making it among the oldest television stations in the world, and one of the very few prewar television stations to remain in existence to the present day.

The first public demonstration of a 30-line mechanical television took place on 14 April 1931. The image rendering was an improvement upon Baird&#x27;s thanks to the development of the &quot;moving light point&quot; system and the use of a camera with Weiller mirror drums by the engineer René Barthélemy, head of the radio laboratory of the Compagnie desmètres (CdC) of Montrouge. In charge of French broadcasting, the PTT administration carried out some rudimentary television experiments from December 1931 by broadcasting experimental 30 to 45 minute broadcasts at variable times from Monday to Saturday with Baird equipment from the medium wave transmitter of Radio PTT. The Barthélemy system was officially adopted in preference to that of Baird, due to the greater stability of the images, for the continuation of experimental transmissions in 1932.

The Minister of the PTT, Henri Queuille, then authorised the CdC to continue its experiments using the PTT superior school transmitter located at 103 rue de Grenelle in the 15th arrondissement of Paris and assigned the company a rudimentary studio at number 93 of the same street. Barthélemy continued his experiments there with a new disc camera from Nipkow which offered much better shooting possibilities than with the previous system. The programs were broadcast in 30 lines on Tuesday and Friday at 5:00 pm by two transmitters, the images by the medium wave transmitter of the higher school of the PTT on the wavelength of 431 meters and the sound by the transmitter of the CdC in Montrouge connected to the studio by a telephone line. These experimental broadcasts only reached a very limited public of amateurs of technical innovation who tinkered with receivers connected to a radio, thus constituting a radiovision receiver.

At the same time, the BBC Television Service had been broadcasting an experimental but regular television service since 22 August 1932, with broadcasts taking place Monday to Friday from 11.00 a.m. to 11.30 a.m., and at night on medium wave on 205 meters after BBC radio programmes closed down for the night. The new French Minister of the PTT of the Flandin Government, Georges Mandel, during a visit to the general manager of the British Broadcasting Corporation at the end of 1934, attended a live broadcast of the Epsom Derby on a televisor built by John Logie Baird.

Convinced by this demonstration and of the interest of this invention for the future, but also very aware that the ministerial instability must lead him to quickly imprint his mark on the heavy administration of the PTT for which he was responsible by modernizing, Georges Mandel decided to inaugurate as soon as possible a regular and experimental public television service in France. In March 1935, he went to the CdC to measure the state of progress of the research. René Barthélemy gave him a demonstration of his new mechanical disc camera with 60 lines of definition (25 images per second), his new telecine (of which he was the inventor) with 180 lines, as well as a receiver with 60 cathode ray tube lines; a tube for which the CdC has just launched production. He also informed him of his ongoing work on a 180-line camera.

Pressed to carry out his project, the minister granted Barthélemy the means requested for his success. The amphitheater of the PTT superior school, located in the premises of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications at 103 rue de Grenelle, was converted into a television studio on 17 April 1935 and its bleachers were dismantled to enlarge it. The CdC&#x27;s 60-line mechanical camera was placed in the adjoining room, behind double-thick insulating glass to mask the sound of the motor spinning the camera disk. This same room also housed the 60-line, 500-watt transmitter designed by the Compagnie des Comptes. The project provided for a short wave transmitter on the Eiffel Tower and a definition of 180 lines in the long term, as soon as Barthélemy had finalized his work.

One thousand guests of the Minister, personalities, journalists and industrialists flocked to the studio at 103 rue de Grenelle on Friday, 26 April 1935 to attend the first official regular French television broadcast transmitted by radio with a definition of 60 lines3. At 8:15 pm, on the small greenish screen appeared the face of the actress and friend of the minister, Béatrice Bretty, member of the Comédie-Française, with at her side, Jean Toscane, the most famous voice of Radio PTT, and René Barthélemy. Lips and eyes made up in black for the needs of television broadcasting, Miss Bretty recounted of her last tour in Italy with the troupe: &quot;We had a great trip...&quot;. These were the first words broadcast on French television. This first television program was broadcast live until 8:30pm on the 175-meter medium-wave frequency within a radius of 100 km. Radiovision-PTT, the first French television channel, had just been born.

Radio-PTT Vision began operations on 26 April 1935 as the first television station in France, using a 30-line mechanical television system based on the Nipkow disk. It was operated by the French PTT agency with a transmitter located atop the Eiffel Tower, and was on air three days a week from 11 am to 11:30 am and 8 pm to 8:30 pm and on Sundays from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm. On 4 January 1937, the broadcasting hours were changed such that television programmes were aired from 5 pm until 10 pm on Wednesdays to Fridays, and from 4 pm to 8:30 pm or 9 pm on Saturdays to Tuesdays.

Impressed by the sharpness of the 60-line images obtained from the cathode-ray tube control receiver during this broadcast, Georges Mandel gave the PTT technicians and René Barthélemy six months to set up the necessary installations for regular public broadcasting in 180 lines. Two months late, the official inauguration of 180-line television took place on Sunday, 8 December 1935, from 5:30pm to 7:30pm in front of the press, at the Radiovision-PTT studio at 103, rue de Grenelle in Paris, with a gala session combining excerpts from plays, comic operas, poems, songs and sketches performed by many famous comedians and music-hall artists invited by Béatrice Bretty, and whose numbers were announced at the screen by Suzy Wincker, the first official continuity announcer, on the air since June.

The rue de Grenelle studio required 50,000 lux of light to compensate for the insufficient sensitivity of the 180-line mechanical camera with a double-spiral Nipkow disk rotating at 50 rotations per second. The dissipation of the heat of this very violent lighting was annoying and even dangerous for the artists. This is why a forced-air refrigeration system (temperature and humidity) was installed in the studio to lower its temperature from 55 to 25 °C by means of six aerators. The images filmed in the studio were routed live by a 2,500 meter long telephone cable to a new transmitter designed by SFR-CSF and temporarily located at the north pillar of the Eiffel Tower, from where a feeder connected it to the four 2 kW shortwave transmitting antennas located at the top of the tower 320 meters high and which can be received 100 km around Paris11. The sound was transmitted in medium wave on the frequency of 206 meters by the transmitter of Radio Tour Eiffel.

The very large public crowds in front of the receivers installed at the &quot;Conservatoire national des arts et métiers&quot; at 292 rue Saint-Martin, at the National Tourist Office of the Champs-Elysées, at the Salon de la France d&#x27;Outre-Mer at the Grand Palais, at the Maison de la Chimie, and at the town hall of the 5th arrondissement of Paris, which simultaneously broadcast the images in 180 lines. Indeed, if Barthélemy&#x27;s Emyvisor was put on sale at the end of 1935, its price was still exorbitant (8,000 to 10,000 francs at the time, or around 6,000 euros today) and only the privileged few could enjoy television at the time.

, new PTT Minister of the Popular Front, launched on 24 October 1936 a call for tenders from radio-electric manufacturers in order to provide television with higher definition equipment exploiting the possibilities offered by the iconoscope and electronic television. Already exploited by the British, Germans and Americans. A test period would enable the best standard to be chosen.

The broadcasts became regular from 4 January 1937 with broadcast from 11am to 11:30am and from 8pm to 8:30pm on weekdays and from 5:30pm to 7:30pm on Sundays. The Deputy Secretary General for Broadcasts, Wladimir Porché, brought the greatest French artists, such as Sacha Guitry, Serge Lifar and Maurice Chevalier, to the cameras of the Radiovision-PTT studio. At that time, there were only about 100 individual television receivers.

Grammont carried out its tests in 441 lines, the Compagnie Française de Télévision (association of the CdC and SFR-CSF) in 450 lines and Thomson-Houston in 455 lines. The PTT administration chose the 455-line high-definition equipment manufactured by Thomson for public demonstrations at the 1937 Paris International Arts and Techniques Exhibition, which was then transferred to the Radiovision-PTT studio for testing.

=== &quot;Radiodiffusion nationale Télévision&quot; ===
Following successful trials of a &quot;high-definition&quot; 455-line electronic television system designed by Thomson-Houston which improved on the 405-line system originally designed by EMI-Marconi, Radio-PTT Vision renamed itself as Radiodiffusion nationale Télévision (RN Télévision) in July 1937. However, broadcasts using the Nipkow disk system continued alongside the new electronic system until 10 April 1938. In July 1938, a decree of the French PTT agency fixed the French terrestrial television standard as transmitting on 455 lines VHF (46 MHz, positive modulation, 25 frames per second), to be adopted throughout France within three years. The adoption of the electronic standard marked the end of mechanical television in France, and the advent of electronic television to obtain much better image quality.

While the BBC Television Service was able to broadcast the arrival of the President of the French Republic Albert Lebrun in London for his official visit on 21 March 1939, RN Télévision was otherwise unable to film a single image. The Minister of the PTT thus promised on 31 March a bus equipped for remote reporting in the open air within two weeks, a new television studio and programs broadcast in the evening after dinner.

The administrative system of public broadcasting was modified by a decree of 29 July 1939 signed by the President of the Council Édouard Daladier, making French Broadcasting, and therefore the television service attached to it, a State monopoly which ceased to depend on the Ministry of PTT to pass under the administration of the National French Radio, newly created for this purpose, endowed with an autonomous budget and placed directly under the authority of the President of the council.

=== World War II ===
The rue de Grenelle studio went on annual vacation on 31 July 1939 and never reopened. Radiodiffusion nationale Télévision then only broadcast films, documentaries and news via its Grammont telecine and identified itself with the callsign Télé-Cinéma Radiodiffusion nationale. When France entered World War II on 3 September 1939, military authorities ordered the cessation of broadcasts and took control of the Eiffel Tower transmitter. The French hardly noticed it because there were no more than 300 receiving stations throughout the territory, which were also watched in a few rare public places. A few broadcasts were still broadcast episodically for transmitter maintenance purposes, but these were not advertised in the press so that the Germans could not use the transmitter signal to locate and bombard Paris. On 6 June 1940, technicians from RN Télévision sabotaged the transmitter to make it unusable by the Germans who were at the gates of Paris.

The German occupying forces initially took no interest in the Eiffel Tower transmitter until an order in May 1941, aimed at reducing transmission sites in the occupied zone in order to recover raw materials, and thus recover certain elements of the French 455-line transmitter of interest to Telefunken lead to discussions on the rehabilitation and use of this transmitter for television. Opposed to this dismantling, , German television pioneer and former director of the programs of Berlin&#x27;s Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow television station, who succeeded in convincing the German authorities to continue the broadcast of the programs of the station during the war by proposing its use to entertain and distract the war wounded in hospitals, took up this idea to apply it to the French capital and thus save the Parisian transmitter. He recommended putting the Eiffel Tower transmitter back into service to broadcast a television channel intended to entertain the German soldiers hospitalized in the &quot;Kriegslazarette&quot; in Paris. In addition, this television channel would open up the French market to the German electrical industry by adopting the German 441-line broadcasting standard developed by Telefunken. Finally, from a military point of view, the repair of this transmitter could allow it to be used as a jammer for enemy planes.

By order of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht to the Ministry of PTT on 20 May 1942, the work to restore the transmitter in the Eiffel Tower to service was entrusted to the Compagnie des comptes de Montrouge and the German firm Telefunken, following a collaboration agreement between the two companies to jointly build the technical infrastructure of this new television channel. The equipment of the Compagnie des Compteurs being considered uninteresting, Telefunken supplied the new television transmitter to the German standard of 441 lines, recovered from the Reichspost in Germany, and which was installed by technicians from Berlin.

Fernsehsender Paris (Paris-Télévision) moved into a large 3,000-seat ballroom, a remnant of the former Magic-City amusement park closed in 1926, unused since the start of the war. This installation made it possible to start the programs on a regular basis on 7 May 1943 only in telecine, because the work on the V-shaped stage, allowing the cameras to be moved back for wider shots, had not been completed. It broadcasts in German and French four days a week from 10 am to noon, three days from 3pm to 8pm and every evening from 8:30pm to 10pm, broadcasting variety shows and theater for field hospitals (Kriegslazarett) of the Wehrmacht installed in the Paris region and German residents in Paris (about 1,000 receivers, including a hundred for French viewers). The station was officially inaugurated on 30 September 1943 with the start of live broadcasts.

A week before the liberation of Paris, Fernsehsender Paris ceased broadcasting on Saturday 12 August 1944 at 11:30 p.m. On 17 August, the order was given to Hinzmann to blow up the Eiffel Tower&#x27;s transmitter, which he refused, contenting himself with firing a few symbolic shots into unimportant equipment. The Germans left the studios, leaving the French with a fully operational and among the most efficient television station in the world, which enabled French television to be the first in Europe to resume its broadcasts from the old studio and with the equipment from Fernsehsender Paris, from 1 October 1944 intermittently and in closed circuit test transmissions, because the Americans had administered the Eiffel Tower at the time and prohibited the use of its transmitter until 1 October 1945.

Television broadcasts in France resumed on 1 October 1944 under the name &quot;Télévision française&quot;, and following the creation of &quot;Radiodiffusion française&quot; on 23 March 1945, the television service was renamed as RDF Télévision française. Following the return of the Eiffel Tower to the French precisely one year (1 October 1945) after the restart, the official resumption of television broadcasts took place with one hour of programming each day. On 20 November 1948, the Secretary of State for Information, François Mitterrand, decreed the adoption of the 819-line high-definition VHF standard, which was in use from 1949 until 1983.

=== &quot;RTF Télévision&quot; ===

&quot;Radiodiffusion française&quot; was renamed as &quot;Radiodiffusion-télévision française&quot; (RTF) on 9 February 1949, and thus began the growth of television as an accepted mass medium in France. RTF was also the first channel in the world to air footage of a Pope, on 17 April 1949, with a film sent from the Vatican of Pope Pius XII talking about the potential of television. On 29 May 1949, the first news programme aired on RTF TV, and on 30 July 1949 a television licence fee was introduced. Residents living outside Paris could view RTF TV for the first time in February 1952 when Télé Lille (now known as France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais), a regional broadcaster operating since 10 April 1950, was co-opted into the RTF TV network and became RTF&#x27;s first relay outside Paris. Still as of 1954, RTF&#x27;s terrestrial network consisted of only three stations reaching 90,000 television sets, while West Germany had set up nine stations by year-end 1953. Its programming was also seen to be stale, with an excessive amount of old movies (120 per year), &quot;stale&quot; newsreels, poor lighting, lack of sport and star performers. Famed French singer of the time Maurice Chevalier actually made his first television appearance in the United Kingdom, as opposed to France. RTF television services were also extended to French Algeria in 1956, which later became TV1 Algeria upon Algerian independence in 1962.

=== ORTF era ===
Following the creation of &quot;RTF Télévision 2&quot; (now France 2) in 1964, the first channel was renamed as &quot;Première chaîne de la RTF&quot; (First Channel of the RTF). With the creation of the ORTF on 25 July 1964, the channel was renamed again to &quot;Première chaîne de l&#x27;ORTF&quot; (First Channel of the ORTF). This period marked the introduction of commercial advertising on 1 October 1968. On 8 January 1969, the ORTF created a subsidiary company called &quot;&quot; (RFP) to handle all advertising on the ORTF channels. The RFP held a monopoly on French TV advertising until the launch of privately owned TV channels in France in the 1980s, and was eventually liquidated in 1993.

=== TF1 era ===

==== Public-owned (1975–1987) ====
TF1, which originally stood for &quot;Télévision française 1&quot; (French Television 1), was created on 1 January 1975 when law 74-696 of 7 August 1974, splitting the ORTF into seven separate organisations, came into effect. The name TF1 was a recommendation of the European Broadcasting Union, who demanded the television unit of the former ORTF rebranded as &quot;Télévision Française&quot;, with the channels being renamed TF1, TF2 and TF3. However, the fact that the three channels were to be independent caused TF1 to become the only channel to use the proposed Télévision Française name. The rebranding to the new name came into effect on 6 January 1975. TF1 adopted a multicoloured logo and cel-animated idents created by , and from 1976 until 1985, analogue computer-generated idents produced using the Scanimate system were also used, created by the American company Robert Abel and Associates with background music composed by Vladimir Cosma. The 1975 TF1 logo was later modified in 1984 and again in 1987.

Colour television was first introduced to TF1 on 1 September 1975 when FR3 (now France 3) agreed to supply some of its colour programming to TF1, and the conversion to colour on TF1 was completed in 1977, though the old 819-line analogue network remained entirely black-and-white until it was decommissioned in 1983. Since TF1&#x27;s privatisation in April 1987, the abbreviation is no longer expanded, so as to avoid confusion with the current public television broadcaster France Télévisions.

==== Private-owned (1987–present) ====
From 1984 to 1986, the French television landscape evolved significantly with the launch of three private television channels: Canal+, La Cinq and TV6. In March 1986, the decided to privatize one of the three public channels. Although initial reports had suggested Antenne 2 (now France 2), on 14 May the government announced that TF1 was selected. The channel was therefore more apt to confront with competition, but still considered left-leaning by the right-wing majority. In April 1987, the construction conglomerate Bouygues won the resulting auction for the sale of TF1. On 16 April, its president, Francis Bouygues, presented a check of three billion francs to the government, completing the privatisation of TF1.

TF1&#x27;s current logo was unveiled on 2 February 1990. It launched a news network, La Chaîne Info (LCI), in 1994.

The channel was available in Italy alongside LCI on digital terrestrial television from 2004 to December 2006 on &quot;Dfree&quot; multiplex. In 2005, TF1 launched TF1 Vision, a video on demand service.

On 20 May 2021, it was announced that TF1 Group, owners of the channel, proposed a merger with Groupe M6, which owns M6. On 16 September 2022, it was announced that the merger was officially abandoned.

Since October 2022, the free DTT channels of the TF1 Group have been accessible free to air via the Astra 1 satellite. This broadcast follows a temporary interruption in encrypted broadcasting to Canal+ and TNTSAT subscribers, following a commercial dispute. However, despite the resumption of encrypted broadcasts within the Canal+ and TNTSAT bouquets, this free-to-air broadcasting continues. LCI is therefore received free of charge in almost all of continental Europe.

On 23 November 2024, Sky News reported that CVC Capital Partners, TF1, RedBird Capital Partners, All3Media, Mediawan and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had been linked to a potential takeover bid for ITV plc and a possible break-up of core assets such as ITV Studios and ITVX. This could see TF1 name launched in UK.

== Criticism ==
Some commentators accuse TF1 of being an excessively populist, commercialised channel. There is a clear emphasis on &quot;light&quot; entertainment programmes over more serious content, and the channel&#x27;s success is sometimes seen as being founded on the &quot;ménagères de moins de 50 ans&quot; (housewives under 50) audience segment. A large proportion of the schedule consists of gameshows, sensational documentaries and dubbed versions of TV series. The channel&#x27;s news service is perceived as consisting of more celebrity news and human-interest stories than its public-sector competitors.

On 16 April 2009, the employee responsible for the &quot;Web innovation&quot; department was fired for criticizing the HADOPI law in a private email (on 19 February) sent to a Member of Parliament. The management of TF1 was notified about the e-mail by the Ministry for Culture and Communication, whose Minister Christine Albanel is also one of the authors of the HADOPI law.

In 2004, Patrick Le Lay, CEO of TF1 made the following statement about the channel&#x27;s aims:
There are many ways to speak about TV, but in a business perspective, let&#x27;s be realistic: at the basis, TF1&#x27;s job is helping Coca-Cola, for example, to sell its product. What we sell to Coca-Cola is available human brain time. Nothing is more difficult than obtaining this availability. This is where permanent change is located. We must always look out for popular programs, follow trends, surf on tendencies, in a context in which information is speeding up, getting manifold and trivialized.

Critics of TF1 also contend that its news coverage is slanted towards supporting right-wing politicians – they were in particular accused of supporting Édouard Balladur in the 1995 presidential elections, and of overstating crime during the 2002 electoral campaign to tilt the balance in favour of former French president Jacques Chirac, who campaigned on a law and order platform.

Key figures within TF1 are close friends to some of the most powerful politicians in France, and the relationship between Bouygues and the public-sector contracting system often raises suspicions. Immigration and violence are arguably conflated in the channel&#x27;s news programmes. In addition, it is occasionally alleged that news reports from TF1 tend to ignore issues yielding a bad light on their parent group (Bouygues), while stressing the problems of competitors (such as Vinci SA).

Such criticism was heavy in the satirical show &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;info&quot;, broadcast on rival network Canal+. However, TF1 now competes in this category with M6, which was initially a generalist channel focusing on musical programmes, but now has programming more resembling TF1 (notably, reality shows that TF1 started running just after M6 introduced them).

<text>In Melbourne Tonight, also known as IMT, was a highly popular nightly Logie award-winning Australian variety television show produced at GTV-9 Melbourne from 6 May 1957 to 1970.

==Overview==
Graham Kennedy was the show&#x27;s main host and star attraction, but other presenters were often called on to present the show on certain nights. &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; had as many as 50 different presenters over its 13 years on air. The format of the show was inspired by the American &quot;Tonight Show&quot; on NBC, but Kennedy&#x27;s exuberant charisma was the key to the success of &quot;IMT&quot;.

The show originally had its own self-titled theme song, written by &quot;IMT&quot; first band leader, Lee Gallagher, but for most of its run, it adopted an uptempo version of the swing tune of &quot;Gee, But You&#x27;re Swell&quot;, written by Abel Baer and Charles Tobias in 1936.

Geoff Corke was Kennedy&#x27;s offsider until 1959, when Bert Newton joined GTV-9 from HSV-7 to become Kennedy&#x27;s straight man. This began a professional partnership that continued for many years and a friendship that continued until Kennedy&#x27;s death in 2005.

Other &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; regulars included Joff Ellen, Val Ruff, Panda Lisner, Anne Marie Fabry, Evie Hayes, Mary Hardy, Rosie Sturgess, Patti McGrath (later Patti Newton), Toni Lamond, Philip Brady, Johnny Ladd, Buster Fiddess, Frank Rich, Jack Little, Noel Ferrier, Elaine McKenna, Bill McCormick, Honnie Van Den Bosch (&quot;barrel girl&quot;), Ted Hamilton, Lesley Baker, The Tune Twisters, and the GTV or Channel 9 Ballet.

The ballet troupe was known as the Royal Dancers. Performers included Denise Drysdale and Roma Egan, directed by Valmai Ennor, a former dancer with the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet.
From 1960, a Friday-night, syndicated, &quot;national&quot; edition of the program aired under the title &quot;The Graham Kennedy Show&quot; (later &quot;The Graham Kennedy Channel Nine Show&quot;), with highlights packages being shown as &quot;The Best of IMT&quot; and &quot;The Best of Kennedy&quot;.

On 7 July 1965, &quot;IMT&quot; featured a then-innovative interstate live split-screen link with &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on TCN-9 Sydney, via the recently completed co-axial cable linking Melbourne and Sydney.

Kennedy signed off from &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; on 23 December 1969 after 12 years. On his final program, he was given a crown—made by the GTV-9 props department—symbolising his reign as king of Australian television.

The following year, &quot;IMT&quot; continued with four hosts, each on a different night of the week—Jimmy Hannan, Ugly Dave Gray, Bert Newton, and Stuart Wagstaff. The program was gradually scaled back from four nights a week to three, then two, with the remaining shows renamed as &quot;The Ugly Dave Gray Show&quot; and &quot;Tonight With Stuart Wagstaff&quot; until they were finally axed in March 1971.

On 20 October 1970, during one of the final programs under the &quot;IMT&quot; banner, British actor Patrick Wymark was scheduled to appear as a guest to promote a theatre play and a TV special. His nonappearance prompted jokes between host Stuart Wagstaff and guest Richard Deacon until news reached GTV-9 that Wymark had collapsed in his hotel room. His death was announced at the end of the program.

&quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; created a long-standing legacy of live variety programs for several decades from GTV-9. Most of the videotapes were erased and reused after broadcast, so fewer than 100 episodes survive today out of the thousands produced and broadcast.

When Kennedy returned to GTV-9 in the early 1970s, he launched his own weekly variety show for the Nine Network, &quot;The Graham Kennedy Show&quot;, but it did not recapture the success of the original &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot;, and was later succeeded by &quot;The Ernie Sigley Show&quot; and &quot;The Don Lane Show&quot;.

=== Advertisements ===
Drawing on his radio experience with Nicky Whitta (who had routinely &quot;sent up&quot; advertisers), Kennedy transformed the live commercials from what would have otherwise been dull pro-forma obligations into a unique comedic art form. On one famous occasion, a scheduled 20-second ad spot for an aspirin product was spun out into 33 minutes of improvised comedy.

Newton has written:The blood would drain from the face of Pelaco shirt-wearing executives in television, advertising and business until they realised that instead of televisual suicide, this skinny little wiseguy was commercial gold. And then they liked his brand of humour a lA commercial I shared with Graham, Raoul Merton (&#x27;of comfort you&#x27;re certain when you wear Raoul Merton&#x27;) changed the footwear buying habits of men.

=== Sam Chisholm ===
Gerald Stone recounts in his book &quot;Compulsive Viewing&quot; that a &quot;cocky young salesman&quot; visited the IMT set hoping for an extra plug for his employer&#x27;s product. The young salesman was Sam Chisholm, who later became a senior executive for variously the Packer and Murdoch media empires. A May 2005 interview with Chisholm records:

: Sam Chisholm: &quot;I was working for Johnson&#x27;s wax at the time, and I don&#x27;t think he believed my ...&quot;
: Graham Davis: &quot;Sales pitch.&quot;
: Sam Chisholm: &quot;Assertions about this product. So I said, &quot;I&#x27;ll go and polish your floors and prove it to you.&quot; Which I did.&quot;
: Graham Davis: &quot;Over at his home?&quot;
: Sam Chisholm: &quot;Absolutely.&quot;
: Graham Davis: &quot;You got down on your hands and knees at his home?&quot;
: Sam Chisholm: &quot;Yep. I started off as his housekeeper and ended up being his boss.&quot;

=== Rover ===
Kennedy requested a &quot;reject&quot; dog from the Jack Davey Memorial Guide Dog Centre and was given a Labrador Retriever which he named &quot;Rover&quot;.

Rover was sometimes brought into the studio to assist with advertisements for Pal dog food. One night the dog showed no interest whatsoever in the product, which Kennedy then himself proceeded to eat with apparent relish, straight from the can – or so it seemed.

Rover also achieved television immortality by relieving himself – live to air – upon one of the huge cameras. The studio audience collapsed in hysterics, but the duration and urgency of Rover&#x27;s impressively hydraulic performance might have led some cynics to question just how impromptu the event really was.

Biographer Blundell quotes Ernie Carroll:Pal dog food, with Rover [...] was time consuming [...] once we fed him all afternoon so that when he came out to do the commercial he didn&#x27;t want to touch the Pal dog food. He was already full of it. [...] on another occasion they had him drink before the show, big drinks. So when he came out, he peed all over the camera and all around the set [...] Even those seemingly innocent dog manoeuvres were carefully planned.Kennedy was exasperated for decades by questions about &quot;whatever happened to Rover&quot;. As late as 1989, on &quot;Graham Kennedy&#x27;s News Hour&quot; (see below), he answered a viewer&#x27;s question couched in exactly those words with the withering reply &quot;... he was a dog. What do you think happened?&quot;

In early June 2005, on the 3AW program &quot;Nightline&quot; with Philip Brady and Bruce Mansfield, Patti (McGrath) Newton stated that her father had often looked after Rover when he appeared at GTV-9. It seems that Kennedy had become increasingly irritated with retrieving Rover from the pound and so, when Patti&#x27;s father&#x27;s dog died, Rover went on to a long and happy life at the McGrath (senior) household.

==Late-1990s version==
In 1996, the format was revived under the title &quot;IMT&quot;, hosted by Frankie J. Holden and screened as a Monday-night variety show. Featured on the show were the comedic stylings of Steven Jacobs, Denise Drysdale, Ann-Maree Biggar, and Julia Morris, who was best known for presenting &quot;The Morris Report&quot;, a comedic take on the news events of the previous week. The show ran until 27 November 1998.

<text>Bouygues S.A. () is a French engineering group headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, France. Bouygues is listed on the Euronext Paris exchange and is a blue chip in the CAC 40 stock market index. The company was founded in 1952 by Francis Bouygues and has been led by his son Martin Bouygues since 1989. Martin&#x27;s older brother, Olivier Bouygues, is a board member.

The group specialises in construction (Colas Group and Bouygues Construction), real estate development (Bouygues Immobilier), media (TF1 Group), and telecommunications (Bouygues Telecom).

The company was founded by Francis Bouygues in 1952. In 1970 Bouygues became listed on the Paris Stock Exchange. In 1985 and 1986, Bouygues acquired road construction groups Screg, Sacer, and Colas; later reorganised as Colas Group. In 1987 the company started operating the television channel TF1 and in 1988 Bouygues moved into its new head office, the Challenger complex, in Saint-Quentin en Yvelines.

In 2010, through its subsidiary Nerem Telecom, Bouygues also acquired HGT Telecom for $170 million from Henri Benezra and his brother Avi.

In 2014, consecutively to Alstom&#x27;s cession of its Energy activities to General Electric, Bouygues granted a call option to the French government, allowing it to acquire a maximum of 20% of Alstom, currently owned by the group. In May 2018, the company purchased the Australian construction company A. W. Edwards.

==Controversies==

===Bid rigging===
In September 2023 Bouygues Construction Expertises Nucléaires (BCEN) was fined €6.2 million after the French competition regulator found them guilty, along with five other companies, of bid rigging over tenders for work at the Marcoule nuclear site.

===Bouygues (UK) Ltd. v Dahl-Jensen (UK) Ltd.===
In this UK construction adjudication matter, the company&#x27;s UK subsidiary had terminated the employment of its mechanical sub-contractor, Dahl-Jensen (UK). The adjudicator made a mistake in calculating outstanding payments due to Dahl-Jensen, which led to a Court of Appeal ruling in 2002 which stated that 

===Flamanville===
Between 2009 and 2011, Bouygues S.A. was illegally employing workers from Poland and Romania exposing them to inhuman working conditions at the construction site of the Flamanville nuclear power plant in Normandy. The company was later condemned for their practices before the court in Cherbourg and was ordered to pay sanctions of between €25,000 and €29,950.

===Cyberattack on Bouygues Construction SA===
On 30 January 2020 a ransomware-type virus was detected on Bouygues Construction&#x27;s computer network although operational activity on the construction sites was disrupted. The &quot;Maze Ransomware Gang&quot; claimed responsibility for the attack and posted a 1.2 GB file that allegedly contained data taken from Bouygues Construction.

<text>Sir Ernest John Hutchings Lemon (9 December 1884 – 15 December 1954) was an English railway engineer, and was chief mechanical engineer of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and later one of its three Vice-Presidents. During the run-up to the Second World War, Lemon was made Director-General of Aircraft Production and made crucial improvements to aircraft production.

== Biography ==

Lemon was born in the small village of Okeford Fitzpaine, in the registration district of Sturminster Newton, North Dorset. His father was a carpenter, and his mother laundress for the Rectory next door, where his first work experience was as a &quot;back door boy&quot;. The Rector recognised his potential, and when the Rector&#x27;s daughter moved to Scotland she took Lemon with her, and he attended Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh. He served an apprenticeship with the North British Locomotive Company and then worked for the Highland Railway and for Hurst Nelson.

In 1911, Lemon became Chief Wagon Inspector of the Midland Railway in England. In 1917, he was made Carriage Works Manager at Derby Works. In 1923, he was appointed Divisional Carriage and Wagon Superintendent at Derby. There he developed production line methods for the construction of wagons and carriages.

Despite having little experience in locomotive engineering, in 1931 Lemon was appointed to the post of chief mechanical engineer (CME) replacing the retiring Henry Fowler. After less than a year as CME however, Lemon was again promoted to Vice-President, Railway Traffic, Operating and Commercial, replacing J.H. Follows who retired due to ill health. Under his Vice-Presidency, the LMS undertook modernisation of their motive power depots. William Stanier had been head-hunted from the Great Western Railway to replace Lemon as CME and revolutionised the LMS&#x27;s locomotive policy.

Lemon was a member of the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps—a Territorial Army unit of the Royal Engineers; he joined as a major in November 1929, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in April 1932. He resigned his commission in August 1943.

During World War II, Lemon was made Director-General of Aircraft Production. He introduced &quot;assembly-line methods&quot; and standardisation which enabled production to be sped up to such an extent that, at the end of the Battle of Britain, the RAF had more operational aircraft than at the start of that Battle, while Germany had fewer. Lemon received a knighthood in the 1941 New Year&#x27;s Honours list. He retired from the railway in 1943 and died in Epsom in 1954.

Following the German collapse in November 1918, was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow by the British Royal Navy. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the scuttling of the fleet. However, British sailors in the harbor managed to board and beach her to prevent her sinking. The ship was refloated, thoroughly examined, and eventually sunk in extensive gunnery testing by the Royal Navy in 1921.

== Design ==

Design work on the class began in 1910 in the context of the Anglo-German naval arms race, with initial discussions focused on the caliber of the main battery; previous German battleships had carried guns, but as foreign navies adopted and weapons, the German naval command felt the need to respond with larger guns of their own. They considered , , and guns. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the (Imperial Naval Office), was able to use public outcry over the Agadir Crisis to pressure the (Imperial Diet) into appropriating additional funds for the (Imperial Navy) to offset the additional cost of the larger weapons. The design staff settled on the 38 cm caliber since the 40 cm was significantly more expensive and the 38 cm gun marked a significant improvement over existing German guns.

 was long at the waterline, and long overall. She had a draft of between . displaced at her designed displacement, which did not include a full load of combat supplies, fuel, and other operational necessities; at full combat load, she displaced up to . ″s displacement was more than greater than that of the preceding ships, making her the largest battleship built by the Imperial Navy. was powered by three sets of Schichau steam turbines, with steam provided by fourteen water-tube boilers, of which eleven were coal-fired and three were oil burning. The propulsion system was rated at and produced a maximum of on trials. Her design speed was , but achieved a maximum speed of . Upon commissioning, she carried a crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men.

The ship was the first German warship armed with eight SK L/45 guns. The main battery guns were arranged in four twin gun turrets: two superfiring turrets each fore and aft. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen SK L/45 guns, four SK L/45 guns and five 60 cm (23.6 in) underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. The ship had an armored belt that was thick and an armored deck that was thick. Her forward conning tower had sides, and the main battery turrets had 350 mm thick sides and thick roofs.

== Service history ==
 was ordered under the provisional name in 1912, under the fourth and final Naval Law, which was passed that year. Construction began at the Schichau-Werke dockyard in Danzig under construction number 913. The ship was laid down on 20 December 1913 and launched on 30 October 1915. Work was delayed considerably by the start of World War I, first by the Russian advance into East Prussia that threatened the shipyards in Danzig and was checked at the Battle of Tannenberg. Once work in the yards resumed, resources were diverted to complete the battlecruiser and the ex-Russian light cruisers and . Work on the ship resumed in earnest after those projects were completed, and was ready for sea trials by 19 October 1916; the tests were conducted between December and January 1917 and the ship was commissioned into service on 14 March. ″s two sister ships, and , both lay incomplete at the end of World War I and were subsequently scrapped, leaving the last battleship built for the Imperial Navy. Most of her crew, including her captain, Victor Harder, came directly from , which had been sunk at the Battle of Jutland in June 1916.

After her commissioning into the High Seas Fleet, was placed in the role of flagship for the commander of the fleet, Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper, a position she held until the end of the war. At the end of August 1917, took Kaiser Wilhelm II to visit the fortified island of Helgoland; the ship was escorted by the battlecruiser and the light cruisers and . After the conclusion of the visit, returned the Kaiser to Cuxhaven. The ship struck the sea bottom outside Cuxhaven, though no major damage was done. The ship saw little activity for the rest of the year, as significant elements of the fleet were detached for Operation Albion, the assault on the Gulf of Riga; with the fleet divided, it could not take any offensive action in the North Sea, and so remained idle until the fleet reassembled.

=== Advance of 23 April 1918 ===
In late 1917, light forces of the High Seas Fleet began interdicting British convoys to Norway. On 17 October the light cruisers and intercepted one of the convoys, sinking nine of the twelve cargo ships and the two escorting destroyers before turning back to Germany. On 12 December, four German destroyers ambushed a second British convoy of five cargo vessels and two British destroyers. All five transports were sunk, as was one of the destroyers. Following these two raids, Admiral David Beatty, the commander of the Grand Fleet, detached battleships from the battle fleet to protect the convoys. The German Imperial Navy () was now presented with an opportunity for which it had been waiting the entire war: a portion of the numerically stronger Grand Fleet was separated and could be isolated and destroyed. Hipper planned the operation: the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group, along with light cruisers and destroyers, would attack one of the large convoys, while the rest of the High Seas Fleet would stand by, ready to attack the British dreadnought battleship squadron.

At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the German fleet departed from the Schillig roadstead. Hipper, aboard , ordered wireless transmissions be kept to a minimum, to prevent radio intercepts by British intelligence. At 06:10 the German battlecruisers had reached a position approximately southwest of Bergen when the battlecruiser lost her inner starboard propeller, which severely damaged the ship&#x27;s engines. The crew effected temporary repairs that allowed the ship to steam at , but it was decided to take the ship under tow. Despite this setback, Hipper continued northward. By 14:00, Hipper&#x27;s force had crossed the convoy route several times but had found nothing. At 14:10, Hipper turned his ships southward. By 18:37, the German fleet had made it back to the defensive minefields surrounding their bases. It was later discovered that the convoy had left port a day later than expected by the German planning staff.

On 24 May, again steamed to Helgoland, this time to take the commander in chief of the fleet, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, and Grand Duke Friedrich von Baden to visit the island. Only joined the ship on this voyage. In August, was dry docked for maintenance, and on the 7th of the month, Hipper replaced Scheer as the fleet commander. was refloated on 24 August in preparation for what was to be the last major training exercise of the fleet, conducted on 6 September.

=== Mutiny and Scapa Flow ===

As the fleet flagship, was to have taken part in a final fleet action days before the Armistice, an operation which envisioned the bulk of the High Seas Fleet sortieing from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet. In order to obtain a better bargaining position for Germany, Admirals Hipper and Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, whatever the cost to the fleet. Consequently, on 29 October 1918, the order was given to depart from Wilhelmshaven to consolidate the fleet in the Jade roadstead, with the intention of departing the following morning. However, starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on mutinied. Early on the 30th, the crew of , which was directly behind , joined in the mutiny. Both ships surrendered after two torpedo boats arrived and threatened to open fire, and the battleships&#x27; crews were taken ashore and incarcerated. The mood of ″s crew was reported as &quot;dangerous&quot;. The rebellion then spread ashore; on 3 November, an estimated 20,000 sailors, dock workers, and civilians fought a battle against the authorities in Kiel in an attempt to secure the release of the jailed mutineers. Meanwhile, on 9 November, the Socialists&#x27; red flag was hoisted aboard , which finally convinced Hipper and Scheer to abandon the plan.

 was not originally intended to be surrendered under the terms of the Armistice, but was substituted for the battlecruiser , which lay incomplete and could not put to sea. As a result, instead of joining the High Seas Fleet when it departed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918, left Germany on 7 January 1919, and after arriving, most of her crew were taken off the by the light cruiser to be returned to Germany. The Royal Navy inspected the ship on 9 January, but many of the technical instruments, including gunnery equipment, had been removed before the ship left Germany. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty that ended the war. A copy of &quot;The Times&quot; informed Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Reuter came to the conclusion that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.

Many of the men aboard had been selected to help unload a supply ship that morning, and so were unavailable to open the seacocks, leaving the remaining crewmen insufficient for the task. As a result, was the last major warship to begin the scuttling process, and British forces in the harbor managed to secure the ship, cut her anchor chains, and run her aground before she could sink in deeper water. Then-Lieutenant Commander Bruce Fraser led the British sailors who boarded . was the only capital ship not successfully sunk in the scuttling. The ship was refloated on 19 July, after which she was towed to the British naval base at Invergordon.

=== British service ===
After the ship arrived in Invergordon, was carefully examined by Royal Navy technicians. Naval engineers inspected the hull, including the screws, bilge keels, and rudders, to determine the water resistance of the hull form. The ship was found to have been approximately as efficient as the British s. The ship&#x27;s armor system was extensively investigated; the British team concluded that the ship had not been modified to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May – 1 June 1916.

The main battery turrets and ammunition magazines were also the subject of intense scrutiny; among the tests conducted was a trial to see how fast the magazines could be flooded—the result was 12 minutes. The gunnery school HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; ran loading trials on the main battery guns. It was found that the guns could be prepared to fire in 23 seconds, 13 seconds faster than in the s. The ship&#x27;s watertight bulkhead and underwater protection systems also particularly interested the inspection team; they paid close attention to the ship&#x27;s pumping and counter-flooding equipment. Early in the inspection, a dockyard worker was killed and several others injured after a candle ignited fumes in the hull, causing an explosion. Edmund Abbott, a Royal Navy lieutenant, was awarded the Albert Medal for his attempts to rescue the injured.

After the inspection was concluded, it was determined to expend as a gunnery target. In January 1921 the first round of gunnery tests was ordered. The gunners at HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; fired the new armor-piercing (AP) shells that had been introduced after the Battle of Jutland. This round of tests was used to determine the most efficient ratio of explosives in the detonator caps; the shells fired at Jutland had a tendency to fragment when striking heavy armor rather than penetrate. The monitor moored some away from to fire her guns from point-blank range. was made to list to starboard by the removal of coal and armor from the port side, to simulate the effect of a shell striking armor from a plunging angle. The forward-most gun turret had by this time been removed. &quot;Terror&quot; fired 17 shells of various types into the ship. The Royal Navy concluded after these tests that the new shells were sufficiently powerful to penetrate heavy armor, and were much more effective than the previous versions that had been employed at Jutland. Following the tests, heavy seas caused the ship to sink in the shallow water; after three months she was again raised and docked for repairs. The ship was readied for a second round of testing by August 1921.

The second series of tests was scheduled for 16 August 1921. The monitor fired a mix of shell types into with her 15 in guns. This time, the shells did not perform as well against ″s heavy armor; one of the AP shells failed to explode and two semi-AP shells appear to have broken up on impact. Six aerial bombs were also detonated on the ship, though they had been placed on board and were detonated remotely. The bombs did not perform as well as had been expected. Immediately following the second round of gunnery trials, was scuttled. The ship sank in Hurd Deep in a depth of approximately 180 m (600 ft).

The most important finding of the trials on was that the thick medium armor was completely useless against large-caliber shells. As a result, the British navy adopted the &quot;all or nothing&quot; armor pioneered by the United States Navy. The &quot;all or nothing&quot; armor theory consisted of protecting the ship&#x27;s vitals with extremely heavy armor, while leaving the rest of the ship completely unprotected. This system was used on Britain&#x27;s first post-war class of battleships, the .

<text>Willem van de Velde the Younger (18 December 1633 (baptised)6 April 1707) was a Dutch marine painter, the son of Willem van de Velde the Elder, who also specialised in maritime art. His brother, Adriaen van de Velde, was a landscape painter.

==Biography==
Willem van de Velde was baptised on 18 December 1633 in Leiden, Holland, Dutch Republic. He was instructed by his father, and around 1650 by Simon de Vlieger, a marine painter of repute at the time, who worked around Weesp. He was also influenced by the work of the Dutch artist Jan van de Cappelle, who excelled at painting cloudy skies, the clouds often being reflected in the calm waters. 

Willem was married twice. In 1652, he married Petronella Le Maire of Weesp. The pair was married for a mere fifteen months, and in 1653 Van de Velde began proceedings to separate from his wife. At that time, he lived at Buitenkant and likely had a view on the harbour and the Amsterdam Admiralty. From 1655 one of his neighbors was Michiel de Ruyter, a Dutch Navy Officer. In 1656 he married Magdalena Walravens, the daughter of a skipper. The couple had four children and the last one was baptized at Zuiderkerk in 1674. He achieved great celebrity by his art before he came to London. 

The younger Van de Velde collaborated with his father, an experienced draughtsman, who prepared studies of the battles, events and seascapes in black and white (ink paintings), while the son used oil paints. Father and son were driven from the Netherlands by the political and economic conditions which resulted from war with the French, and moved to England. Here they were engaged by Charles II, both at a salary of £100, the Younger to aid his father in &quot;taking and making draughts of sea-fights&quot;, his part of the work being to reproduce in color the drawings of the elder Van de Velde. He was also patronized by the Duke of York and by various members of the nobility.

He died on 6 April 1707 in Westminster, England, and was buried at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. A memorial to him and his father lies within the church.

==Works==

Most of Van de Velde&#x27;s finest works represent views off the coast of Holland, with Dutch shipping. His best productions are delicate, spirited and finished in handling, and correct in the drawing of the vessels and their rigging. The numerous figures are tellingly introduced, and the artist is successful in his renderings of sea, whether in calm or storm. The ships are portrayed with almost photographic accuracy, and are the most precise guides available to the appearance of 17th-century ships.

Substantial collections of Van de Velde&#x27;s paintings and drawings are held in the National Gallery, National Maritime Museum and the Wallace Collection, all in London; the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam; and the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.

<text>SMS was the lead ship of the of dreadnought battleships in the German (Imperial Navy). The vessel was launched in February 1915 and entered service in July 1916, too late to take part in the Battle of Jutland. Her main armament consisted of eight 38 cm (15 in) guns in four turrets, which was a significant improvement over the preceding ″s ten 30.5 cm (12 inch) guns. The ship was to have formed the nucleus for a fourth battle squadron in the High Seas Fleet, along with three of her sister ships. Of the other ships only one——was completed; the other two were canceled later in the war when production requirements shifted to U-boat construction.

 was commissioned midway through the war, and had a limited service career. The first operation in which the ship took part was an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea on 18–19 August 1916, a month after she had been commissioned. The ship also participated in Operation Albion in the Gulf of Riga, but shortly after the German attack began on 12 October 1917, was mined and had to be withdrawn for repairs. She was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the end of World War I. On 21 June 1919, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the fleet to be scuttled; sank at 14:30. In September 1934, the ship was raised, towed to Rosyth, and scrapped.

== Design ==

Design work on the class began in 1910 in the context of the Anglo-German naval arms race, with initial discussions focused on the caliber of the main battery; previous German battleships had carried guns, but as foreign navies adopted and weapons, the German naval command felt the need to respond with larger guns of their own. They considered , , and guns. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the (Imperial Naval Office), was able to use public outcry over the Agadir Crisis to pressure the (Imperial Diet) into appropriating additional funds for the (Imperial Navy) to offset the additional cost of the larger weapons. The design staff settled on the 38 cm caliber since the 40 cm was significantly more expensive and the 38 cm gun marked a significant improvement over existing German guns.

 was long at the waterline, and an even long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of displaced at a normal displacement; at full combat load, she displaced up to . was powered by three Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by three oil-fired and eleven coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft water-tube boilers. Her propulsion system was rated at for a maximum speed of , and on trials achieved for a maximum speed of . The ship could carry up to of coal and of fuel oil, which provided a maximum range of at a cruising speed of .

The ship was the first German warship armed with eight SK L/45 guns. The main battery guns were arranged in four twin gun turrets: two superfiring turrets each fore and aft. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen SK L/45 guns, four SK L/45 guns and five 60 cm (23.6 in) underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. Upon commissioning, she carried a crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men. The ship had an armored belt that was thick and an armored deck that was thick. Her forward conning tower had sides, and the main battery turrets had 350 mm thick sides and thick roofs.

== Service history ==
 was ordered with the provisional name &quot;T&quot; in 1912, under the fourth and final Naval Law, which was passed that year. Work began at the Howaldtswerke Dockyard in Kiel under construction number 590. The ship was laid down on 22 December 1913 and launched on 18 February 1915. After fitting out, she was commissioned on 18 March, but remained largely idle in port for the next month, undergoing initial tests, including inclination tests to determine how the vessel responded to flooding. She got underway on 15 April for initial trials of her main battery, which lasted into the next day. conducted her first full-power speed test on 25 April off the island of Alsen; these trials continued until 2 May. After further examinations, the ship was deemed ready for service on 15 July, a month and a half too late for her to participate in the Battle of Jutland.

 joined III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet upon her commissioning. The ship would have been available for the operation, but the ship&#x27;s crew, composed largely of the crew from the recently decommissioned battleship , was given leave. She had cost the Imperial German Government 49 million Goldmarks. was later joined in service by one sister ship, . Two other ships of this class, and , were canceled before they were completed. At the time of her commissioning, ″s commander was (Captain at Sea) Max Hahn. Ernst Lindemann, who went on to command the battleship during her only combat sortie in World War II, served aboard the ship as a wireless operator. On 25 May, Ludwig III of Bavaria, the last King of Bavaria, visited the ship. briefly served as the fleet flagship, from 7 to 16 August.

Admiral Reinhard Scheer planned a fleet advance for 18–19 August 1916; the operation consisted of a bombardment conducted by I Scouting Group. This was an attempt to draw out and destroy Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. As and were the only two German battlecruisers still in fighting condition, three dreadnoughts were assigned to the unit for the operation: and the two ships and . Admiral Scheer and the rest of the High Seas Fleet, including 15 dreadnoughts, were to trail behind and provide cover. The makeshift I Scouting Group conducted familiarization exercises on 15 August in preparation for the operation; Hipper was displeased by the slow speed of the battleships and Scheer ordered the unit not to exceed from the main fleet so as to avoid being cut off by the faster British battlecruisers.

The Germans got underway late in the day on 18 August; the British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35 on 19 August, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Another sortie into the North Sea followed on 18–20 October, and the German fleet again encountered no British naval forces. The High Seas Fleet was reorganized on 6 December, and was stationed in the second position of III Squadron, since she was not outfitted to serve as a squadron flagship. Her placement as the second vessel in the line nevertheless would have allowed her to bring her greater firepower into action as quickly as possible.

=== Operation Albion ===

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to evict the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. To this end, the (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic islands of Ösel, particularly the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint Army-Navy operation to capture Ösel and Moon islands; the primary naval component consisted of the flagship and III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. At this time, V Division included the and four -class battleships. VI Division consisted of the five s. Along with 9 light cruisers, 3 torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and 6 zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on Ösel numbered some 14,000 men.

The operation began on 12 October, when , along with and the four s, began firing on the Russian shore batteries at Tagga Bay. Simultaneously, the five s engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and Dagö islands, thus blocking the only escape route of the Russian ships in the gulf. role in the operation was cut short when she struck a naval mine at 5:07 while moving into her bombardment position at Pamerort. The mine explosion killed one and six sailors, allowed of water into the ship and caused the forecastle to sink by . Despite the damage inflicted by the mine, engaged the naval battery at Cape Toffri on the southern tip of Hiiumaa. was released from her position at 14:00. Preliminary repairs were made on 13 October in Tagga Bay. The temporary repairs proved ineffective, and had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs; the return trip took 19 days. Repairs lasted from 3 November to 27 December, during which the forward torpedo tube room was stripped of its equipment and the torpedo ports were sealed. The room was then turned into an additional watertight compartment. Four SK L/30 anti-aircraft guns were also installed during the repairs.

On 16 October, two -class battleships and several smaller vessels were sent to engage the Russian battleships in the Gulf of Riga. The following day, and engaged the Russian battleships— dueled with and fired on both and the cruiser . The Russian vessels were hit dozens of times, until at 10:30 the Russian naval commander, Admiral Bakhirev, ordered their withdrawal. had taken too much damage, and was unable to escape; instead, she was scuttled and her crew was evacuated on a destroyer. By 20 October, the naval operations were effectively over; the Russian fleet had been destroyed or forced to withdraw, and the German army held the islands in the gulf.

=== Subsequent operations ===
Following her return to the fleet, was assigned to security duties in the North Sea. Admiral Scheer had used light surface forces to attack British convoys to Norway beginning in late 1917. As a result, the Royal Navy attached a squadron of battleships to protect the convoys, which presented Scheer with the possibility of destroying a detached squadron of the Grand Fleet. Scheer remarked that &quot;A successful attack on such a convoy would not only result in the sinking of much tonnage, but would be a great military success, and would ... force the English to send more warships to the northern waters.&quot; Scheer instituted strict wireless silence in preparation for the planned attack. This denied the British the ability to intercept and decrypt German signals, which had previously been a significant advantage. The operation called for Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to attack the convoy and its escorts on 23 April while the battleships of the High Seas Fleet stood by in support.

On 22 April, and the rest of the German fleet assembled in the Schillig Roads outside Wilhelmshaven and departed the following morning at 06:00. Heavy fog forced the Germans to remain inside their defensive minefields for half an hour. Hipper&#x27;s forces were west of Egerö, Norway, by 05:20 on 24 April. Despite the success in reaching the convoy route undetected, the operation failed due to faulty intelligence. Reports from U-boats indicated to Scheer that the convoys sailed at the start and middle of each week, but a west-bound convoy had left Bergen on Tuesday the 22nd and an east-bound group left Methil, Scotland, on the 24th, a Thursday. As a result, there was no convoy for Hipper to attack.

The same day, one of screws slipped off, which caused serious damage to the power plant and allowed of water into the ship. was forced to break radio silence in order to inform Scheer of the ship&#x27;s condition, which alerted the Royal Navy to the High Seas Fleet&#x27;s activities. Beatty sortied with a force of 31 battleships and four battlecruisers, but was too late to intercept the retreating Germans. The Germans reached their defensive minefields early on 25 April, though approximately off Helgoland was torpedoed by the submarine . nevertheless successfully returned to port.

=== Fate ===
From 23 September to early October, served as the flagship of III Squadron, under (Vice Admiral) Hugo Kraft. was to have taken part in what would have amounted to the &quot;death ride&quot; of the High Seas Fleet shortly before the end of World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from its base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet. Scheer—by now the of the fleet—intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to obtain a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet.

While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, war-weary sailors began rioting. On 24 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on several battleships mutinied; three ships from III Squadron refused to weigh anchor, and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships and . The order to sail was rescinded in the face of this open revolt. In an attempt to suppress the mutiny, the battleship squadrons were dispersed. , along with the rest of III Squadron, was sent to Kiel.

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the majority of the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow. was listed as one of the ships to be handed over. On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , before meeting a flotilla of 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow.

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered his ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. sank at 14:30. The ship was raised on 1 September 1934 and was broken up the following year in Rosyth. The ship&#x27;s bell was eventually delivered to the German Federal Navy and is on display at Kiel Fördeklub. Some parts of the ship, including her main battery gun turrets, remain on the sea floor between , where they can be accessed by scuba divers.

<text>George Hughes (9 October 1865 – 27 October 1945) was an English locomotive engineer, and chief mechanical engineer (CME) of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS).
==Biography==
George Hughes was born on 9 October 1865 and served a premium apprenticeship at the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Crewe Works between 1882 and 1886.

At the L&amp;YR he started in the test room, and Bulleid notes the L&amp;YR&#x27;s John Aspinall was most pleased with his work there. He progressed through various positions at the L&amp;YR culminating in achieving in becoming chief mechanical engineer in March 1904. 

He introduced the L&amp;YR locomotive classification system around 1919. 

When the L&amp;YR amalgamated into the LNWR in January 1922 he became the CME of the combined group and was appointed the CME of the LMS on its formation at the 1923 grouping.

He retired in July 1925 after only two and a half years at the LMS. He was succeeded by Henry Fowler who had worked with him at Horwich Works before moving to the former Midland Railway&#x27;s Derby Works.

He died on 27 October 1945.

===L&amp;YR===
* Class 4, a superheated development of the Class 3, there were 2 versions each having different cylinder sizes and valve gear. 
* Class 6, a superheated development of the Class 5
* Class 8 4-6-0 &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. As initially built these express passenger engines had significant issues, following rebuild their performance was &quot;creditable&quot;.
* Class 28, a superheated development of the Class 27
* Railmotors
* 2-10-0, a heavy mineral loco design of 1914, not built owing to the outbreak of the Great War.

===LMS===
* LMS Hughes Crab, a 5P4F mixed-traffic locomotive had the basic design completed before Hughes&#x27; retirement. It was the last design from Horwich Works and Marshall gives it the accolade &quot;The engine became at once, and remained, one of the best on the LMS&quot;. 245 were produced and Marshall comments the successful LMS Fowler 2-6-4T was also influenced by the design.
* 4-6-4T &quot;Dreadnought tank&quot;, Designed for L&amp;YR, built by the LMS.

<text>The Nestlé Children&#x27;s Book Prize, and Nestlé Smarties Book Prize for a time, was a set of annual awards for British children&#x27;s books that ran from 1985 to 2007. It was administered by BookTrust, an independent charity that promotes books and reading in the United Kingdom, and sponsored by Nestlé, the manufacturer of Smarties chocolate. It was one of the most respected and prestigious prizes for children&#x27;s literature.

There were three award categories defined by audience ages 0 to 5 years, 6 to 8 years, and 9 to 11 years (introduced in 1987 after two years with no single prize). Silver and bronze runners-up in each category were introduced in 1996 and designation of one overall winner was abandoned at the same time.

Eligible books were written by UK citizens and residents and published during the preceding year (not precisely the calendar year). The shortlists were selected by a panel of adult judges, finally chaired by Julia Eccleshare, children&#x27;s books editor for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. First, second, and third places were determined by British schoolchildren—at least finally, by vote of &quot;selected school classes&quot;
The prize was discontinued in 2008 by what was described as a &quot;mutual&quot; decision from BookTrust and Nestlé, with &quot;no hostility&quot;. Explaining their reasons for this decision, BookTrust stated it had &quot;been reviewing the organisation&#x27;s priorities and how prizes and awards fit in with its strategic objectives&quot;, while Nestlé was &quot;increasingly moving its community support towards the company strategy of nutrition, health and wellness.&quot; Additionally, they said that it was a &quot;natural time to conclude&quot; and that they were &quot;confident that increased importance has been placed on children&#x27;s books.&quot;

==Winners==
There were 65 winning books in 23 years and 72 silver or bronze runners-up in the last twelve years.

=== 1980s ===
=== 1990s ===
Beginning in 1996, the awards included silver and bronze winners rather than a single overall winner.
=== 2000s ===

<doc id="571397" wikidata="Q860895" url="?curid=571397" title="Chloe Sullivan">
<text>Chloe Sullivan is a fictional character in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, based on the Superman and Superboy comics published by DC Comics. Portrayed by series regular Allison Mack, Chloe was an original character created exclusively for &quot;Smallville&quot; by series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. Other than main protagonist Clark Kent, Chloe is the only main character to last the whole duration of the show, though Mack signed on for only five episodes in the tenth and final season. The character has also appeared in various literature based on &quot;Smallville&quot;, a web series, and was later adapted back into the original Superman comics that inspired &quot;Smallville&quot;.

In &quot;Smallville&quot;, Chloe is Clark Kent&#x27;s best friend, Lois Lane&#x27;s cousin, and the editor of the high school newspaper the &quot;Torch&quot;; she notices that the meteor rocks (kryptonite) are mutating the citizens of Smallville which she tracks on her &quot;Wall of Weird&quot;. She generally teams up with friends Clark and Pete Ross to research and stop meteor-infected people from harming other citizens. In the first five seasons, Chloe harbors an unrequited love for Clark, but eventually accepts her place as his platonic friend and nothing more. In later seasons, Chloe discovers she herself has the metahuman power of empathic healing, though she apparently loses it after an encounter with the alien supervillain Brainiac. In terms of romantic storylines, after Jimmy Olsen (the same-named older brother of &quot;Superman&quot; supporting character James Bartholomew Olsen) is introduced to the show, he becomes Chloe&#x27;s boyfriend and later husband, but the pair later divorces after a monster disrupts their wedding. In the show&#x27;s final two seasons, Chloe finds love with Oliver Queen, otherwise known as the costumed vigilante-archer Green Arrow, whom she eventually marries and has a son with.

Chloe Sullivan has been characterized as independent, intelligent, curious and somewhat impulsive by both the writers and the actress that portrays her. The latter two characteristics often cause Chloe to get into trouble with both her friends and with billionaire industrialists Lionel Luthor and his son Lex, two of the show&#x27;s primary antagonists. Mack has been recognized with multiple award nominations and wins for her breakout portrayal of Chloe.

==Role in &quot;Smallville&quot;==
Introduced in the series pilot, Chloe spends much of her time helping her best friend Clark Kent (Tom Welling) investigating random mutant citizens of Smallville. These individuals develop special abilities caused by the meteor rocks that fell to Smallville in 1989, and use them to commit crimes. It is established at the start of the first season that Chloe is an aspiring journalist and the editor of the school newspaper &quot;The Torch&quot;. Her journalistic curiosity—always wanting to &quot;expose falsehoods&quot; and &quot;know the truth&quot;—causes tension with her friends, especially when she is digging into Clark&#x27;s past in the season two episode &quot;Lineage&quot;. In the early seasons, Chloe hides the fact that she is deeply in love with Clark, although the feeling is not reciprocated; she confesses her love to Clark in season two&#x27;s &quot;Fever&quot; while he is sick and unconscious, but to her dismay he calls out Lana Lang&#x27;s name in his delirium. Her feelings and frustration for Clark get in the way of her better judgment as she betrays his trust in the season two finale, after witnessing him and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) sharing a kiss in his barn, and agrees to uncover information on Clark for Lionel Luthor (John Glover) in exchange for a job at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

Chloe and Clark patch their relationship in the season three episode &quot;Whisper&quot;, after Clark discovers that she has been helping Lionel. When Chloe stops her investigation, Lionel not only has her blacklisted from the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, but also fires her father from LuthorCorp. In season three&#x27;s &quot;Forsaken&quot;, Chloe decides to assist Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), Lionel&#x27;s estranged son, with getting Lionel arrested for the past murder of Lex&#x27;s grandparents; Chloe&#x27;s hope is to get out from under Lionel&#x27;s control. In the season three finale, the FBI place Chloe and her father in a safehouse in waiting for Lionel&#x27;s trial, but the safe-house explodes once Chloe and her father enter and they are presumed dead. This prompts Chloe&#x27;s maternal cousin Lois Lane (Erica Durance) to come to Smallville to investigate Chloe&#x27;s death in the fourth season premiere. In season four&#x27;s &quot;Gone&quot;, Clark and Lois team-up and discover that Lex&#x27;s security team had found the explosives in the safehouse and absconded Chloe and her father to safety before the bomb detonated, and that he has been hiding her ever since. After Chloe&#x27;s testimony in the same episode, Lionel is convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In the season four episode &quot;Pariah&quot;, Chloe discovers Clark&#x27;s secret when Clark&#x27;s ostracized girlfriend Alicia Baker (Sarah Carter) decides that his secret needs to be exposed to the world in order for him to finally accept who he really is. Alicia expects Chloe to write an exposé about Clark, but Chloe decides that Clark kept his secret for a reason and decides not to write the story instead.

Chloe finally reveals to Clark in the season five premiere that she has known his secret, but that she wanted him to be comfortable enough to tell her on his own. At the same time, Clark reveals that he was not infected by the meteor rocks in Smallville, as Chloe initially suspected, but that he is in fact an alien who was sent to Earth as a baby during the meteor shower of 1989. In season five&#x27;s &quot;Thirst&quot;, Chloe earns her dream job at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, starting in the basement. In the season six episode &quot;Justice&quot;, Chloe begins assisting Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) and his team of superheroes under the codename &quot;Watchtower&quot;. In &quot;Freak&quot;, she discovers she herself is meteor-infected, with an unknown ability, and begins to worry that she is a &quot;time bomb&quot; heading towards insanity. She later discovers in &quot;Progeny&quot; that her institutionalized mother, Moira Sullivan (Lynda Carter), is meteor-infected as well. In the season finale, Chloe learns that her special power lets her heal any wound and even reverse death, when it activates to save Lois. In season seven&#x27;s &quot;Descent&quot;, when Chloe attempts to keep information regarding &quot;The Traveler&quot; a secret from Lex, who is unaware that &quot;The Traveler&quot; is really Clark, he fires her from her job at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. When in &quot;Sleeper&quot;, Lana falls into a catatonic state having been attacked by the Kryptonian artificial intelligence known as Brainiac (James Marsters). Chloe takes over Lana&#x27;s Isis Foundation, a free clinic for individuals who have been infected by the meteor rocks. In the seventh season finale, Chloe is attacked by Brainiac, but her healing powers prevent him from harming her. When she returns home, Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore), her on-again-off-again boyfriend since season six, proposes marriage. Before Chloe can answer the Department of Domestic Security (DDS) appears and arrests her for hacking into the government database.

At the start of season eight, it is revealed that Chloe was not arrested by DDS, but Lex&#x27;s security personnel impersonating DDS agents. While subjected to their tests, Chloe discovers that her altercation with Brainiac has apparently caused to her to lose her meteor-related powers, but instilled two new abilities: vast super intelligence and technopathy. Returning to Smallville, Chloe reopens the Isis Foundation. Though she loves Jimmy, she finds herself attracted to paramedic Davis Bloome (Samuel Witwer). In the episode &quot;Abyss&quot;, Brainiac&#x27;s infestation causes Chloe to lose her memories. Clark takes Chloe to his biological father Jor-El, who restores her memories. After Chloe marries Jimmy in &quot;Bride&quot;, she is kidnapped by Doomsday, a genetically engineered killing machine bent on destroying Earth and becomes Brainiac&#x27;s vessel once again. Brainiac attempts to drain the world of all its human knowledge but is stopped and removed from Chloe&#x27;s body by the Legion, superheroes from the future, in &quot;Legion&quot;. In &quot;Hex&quot;, Chloe assumes the codename Watchtower full time because she feels her life needs more meaning. Chloe discovers that Davis is Doomsday in &quot;Eternal&quot;. She attempts to assist Davis&#x27; suicide using kryptonite; when this fails, she stays by his side in order to keep Doomsday under control. In the episode &quot;Beast&quot;, she and Davis leave town together; Chloe reasons it will protect Clark. In the season eight finale, she uses black kryptonite to separate Davis from Doomsday; Clark buries Doomsday beneath Metropolis. When Davis discovers that Chloe is still in love with Jimmy, he stabs Jimmy and attempts to kill Chloe; Jimmy impales him on a metal rod, and they both die. Chloe vows to keep the Watchtower Jimmy gave her as a wedding gift open, in the hope that all lost heroes—namely Oliver and his team—will find their way home.

At the start of the ninth season, using Oliver&#x27;s money, Chloe transforms the Watchtower into an information fortress and superhero headquarters. In this capacity, she acquires a rival in Tess&#x27;s computer expert Stuart Campbell (Ryan McDonell); her status as superhero information broker also makes her a target for Checkmate bosses Amanda Waller (Pam Grier) and Maxwell Lord (Gil Bellows). Over the course of the season, she grows romantically close to Oliver. In the season ten première, when Oliver is kidnapped by Suicide Squad leader Rick Flag (Ted Whittall), Chloe risks her own sanity by putting on the helmet of Doctor Fate to learn his location. With the information acquired from Fate&#x27;s helmet, she organizes a switch for Oliver; in Flag&#x27;s captivity, Chloe fakes suicide and goes off-the-grid. Chloe returns in &quot;Collateral&quot;, and reveals that she has been helping Clark, Oliver, and the rest of the heroes while in hiding, having blackmailed the Suicide Squad into helping her. Afterward, she resumes her relationships with the show&#x27;s protagonists. In the episode &quot;Fortune&quot;, Chloe decides to move to Star City to return to journalism following her marriage to Oliver Queen. In a flashforward in the series finale, Chloe is now the mother to a young boy, but remains in touch with Clark and Lois.

==Portrayal==
Chloe Sullivan was introduced by the show&#x27;s creators to be a &quot;Lois Lane archetype&quot;, as well as be &quot;Smallville&quot;″s &quot;outsider&quot;, which series developers Gough and Millar felt the show needed in order to have a character that notices the strange happenings in Smallville. She is the original creation of Al Gough and Miles Miller, having not been produced first in the DC Comics Universe, unlike the other main characters Clark Kent, Lana Lang, Lex Luthor and Pete Ross. When they first began developing the series, Gough and Millar had intended for Chloe to have an &quot;ethnic background&quot;. After learning about &quot;Smallville&quot; from the show&#x27;s casting director, Dee Dee Bradley, Allison Mack toyed with the idea of auditioning for the role of Lana Lang, but chose instead to audition for the role of Chloe Sullivan. Gough and Millar felt she had a &quot;rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary dialogue conversationally&quot;, and decided to cast her against their initial intention to give the character an ethnic origin. According to Mack, the reason she got the role was because she went into her second audition with a &quot;very flippant attitude&quot;. Kristen Bell also auditioned for the role of Chloe Sullivan; she would eventually go on to star in the television series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;. Aside from Allison Mack, Roan Curtis portrayed Chloe as a child in the season six episode &quot;Progeny&quot;, with Victoria Duffield portraying a young Chloe during junior high school in the eighth season episode &quot;Abyss&quot;. Mack enjoyed the fact that her character was created specifically for the show, because she feels like she does not have to worry about being compared to someone else in the same role, which she likens to people comparing Michael Rosenbaum&#x27;s performance as Lex Luthor to Gene Hackman&#x27;s portrayal in the &quot;Superman&quot; film series of the 1970-80s. Mack only signed on for five episodes of the tenth and final season.

==Character development==
===Storyline progression===
Allison Mack was disappointed that the character &quot;lost some of her backbone&quot; in the second season. The second season was about exploring Chloe&#x27;s heart, and the idea of her being this &quot;lovelorn […] angsty teenager&quot;. As Mack describes her, &quot;Chloe was a little spineless and a little bit too much of a pushover in season two&quot;. Mack does believe that by the end of the season Chloe manages to get some of that integrity back. The actress likes to make sure that her character is kept &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;ambitious&quot;, but at the end of season two Chloe&#x27;s impulsiveness causes her to get stuck under Lionel&#x27;s control, when she &quot;spitefully&quot; agrees to uncover Clark&#x27;s secrets for Lionel Luthor after Clark is not honest with her about his newly established relationship with Lana.

For season three, Mack wanted the character to be given a major obstacle to overcome, something that would help the character mature. The obstacle in question became Lionel&#x27;s control over Chloe, after she made a deal to spy on Clark. Allison Mack believes that Chloe is in her own comfort zone while she is working at the &quot;Torch&quot;, as she is in complete control, but likens Chloe being under Lionel&#x27;s control to that of a &quot;caged animal&quot;. When she ruins the lives of a mother and her son in season three&#x27;s &quot;Truth&quot;, after exposing the mother as a fugitive from the law, Chloe is forced to look deeper into her own self. Mack believes that this event was a turning point for Chloe&#x27;s maturity; it is the moment that she realizes that there needs to be a line she should never cross. After it is revealed to Clark in the season five premiere that Chloe knows his secret, the character becomes a larger part of the storyline for the show. Knowing Clark&#x27;s secret allowed Chloe to finally come to terms with her feelings for Clark, and recognize where their relationship will always be; Chloe&#x27;s acceptance of her place in Clark&#x27;s life provides a means for the two to have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe&#x27;s unrequited love. According to Mack, Chloe has learned to evolve her love for Clark into something more &quot;genuine&quot; and &quot;selfless&quot;.

For the actress, having Chloe become part of the meteor infected community in season six allowed Mack&#x27;s character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand what it feels like to live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois&#x27;s presence at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.

===Characterization===
Allison Mack characterizes Chloe as being a &quot;misfit&quot; during the first season; more of &quot;a really smart girl with attitude&quot;. She goes on to describe Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe&#x27;s defining characteristics is her need to &quot;expose falsehoods&quot; and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious and wants to be honest with people. She is always trying to make sense of the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe&#x27;s love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that &quot;drives Chloe to be as ambitious and as focused as she is&quot;.

A leading theory among audiences was that Chloe would eventually change her name to Lois Lane, Clark&#x27;s wife in the comics, as she embodies various characteristics that Lois Lane has in the comic books. The creative team removed the notion that Chloe was going to turn into Clark&#x27;s future wife when they introduced Lois Lane in season four. Though the characters share similarities, according to Mack, Chloe and Lois are more &quot;different shades of the same color […] Chloe is a softer version of Lois&quot;. Chloe&#x27;s upbringing allows her to be less jaded than Lois. Chloe also looks to the future, whereas Lois is more shortsighted.

The season six finale reveals that Chloe has the ability to heal others. Mack describes Chloe&#x27;s newfound meteor power as similar to &quot;empathy&quot;. The actress further defines the power as the ability to heal others by taking their pain and making it her own. Writer Todd Slavkin contends that giving Chloe the power to heal was the best choice for the character. According to Slavkin, Chloe has sacrificed so much in her life for the greater good that it only seemed natural that her meteor power would reflect that. For the writer, it did not make sense for her ability to be something &quot;malicious, evil and destructive&quot;. In season eight, Chloe discovers that she also has super-intelligence – being able to solve complex algorithms faster than LuthorCorp&#x27;s most powerful supercomputer. She and Clark later deduce that her newfound intelligence was brought on during her encounter with Brainiac, who infected her with a part of himself during his attack.

===Relationships===
One of Chloe&#x27;s key relationships is with the series protagonist, Clark Kent. Although believers in the &quot;Chlois&quot; theory initially suspected that Chloe would eventually become Lois Lane, Clark&#x27;s future wife in the comics, Mack contends that Clark does not love Chloe in the way that she loves him. The actress does not believe that Clark&#x27;s feelings will ever change. Regardless of Clark&#x27;s feelings, Mack recognizes that Chloe is blinded by her love for Clark, which ultimately affects her judgment in not only seeing Clark&#x27;s faults, but making choices that place her character in danger. In season five, Clark finally discovers that Chloe knows his secret, and this revelation allows Chloe the opportunity to come to terms with her feelings for Clark; this also provided a means for the two have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe&#x27;s unrequited love.

Speaking on the evolving relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack believes that the season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe&#x27;s life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark&#x27;s secret, as well as keeping the fact that she is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe&#x27;s heart that Clark occupied for so long.

Chloe&#x27;s relationship with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar came up with the idea that Chloe&#x27;s mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a &quot;latchkey kid&quot;, in an effort to explain why she is out all hours of the night. Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues, which play on the fact that she never feels like she is good enough for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends. One of Chloe&#x27;s story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.

==Reception==
Allison Mack has been nominated for a number of awards for her role as Chloe Sullivan. She was nominated for a Saturn Award as best supporting actress in a television program in 2006 and 2007. Mack has been nominated seven consecutive times—between 2002 and 2009—for Teen Choice Award&#x27;s Choice Teen Sidekick; she won the award in 2006 and 2007.

==Other media appearances==
Apart from her appearances on television, Chloe has also appeared in her own online spin-off, a series of young adult novels, a bi-monthly &quot;Smallville&quot; comic book, and been given a 2010 introduction into the official DC comics universe.

===&quot;Chloe Chronicles&quot;===
Apart from the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, the character of Chloe Sullivan appeared in her own web-based spin-off series, titled &quot;Smallville: Chloe Chronicles&quot;. Allison Mack continued her duties as the investigative, high school reporter, with the series originally airing exclusively on AOL.com. The first volume aired between April 29 and May 20, 2003. The web series eventually made its way to Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 website. &quot;Smallville: Chloe Chronicles&quot; was created by Mark Warshaw, with the scripts written by Brice Tidwell; Allison Mack was given final script approval. This final approval allowed Mack to review and make changes to the script as she saw fit. Warshaw also communicated regularly with Gough and Millar so that he could find more unique ways to expand &quot;Smallville&quot; stories over to &quot;Chloe&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;.

In the first volume, picking up some time after the events of season one&#x27;s &quot;Jitters&quot;, Chloe begins checking into the rumors of the &quot;Level 3&quot; facility at the Smallville LuthorCorp plant. Here, she starts investigating the death of LuthorCorp employee Earl Jenkins, which takes her to a research company known as Nu-Corp. Chloe interviews Nu-Corp&#x27;s Dr. Arthur Walsh, who reveals that he knows what really happened to Earl Jenkins while he was working at LuthorCorp. Walsh disappears before Chloe can get all of the information.

In volume two, Chloe is contacted by an ex-Navy SEAL, Bix, and former member of LuthorCorp&#x27;s &quot;Deletion Group&quot; who has information regarding Dr. Walsh&#x27;s disappearance. Walsh begins sending Chloe videos, which lead Chloe to discover that Walsh was working with Donovan Jameson, the head of Nu-Corp, and Dr. Stephen Hamilton on experimentations involving the meteor rocks. Chloe and Pete Ross (Sam Jones III), who accompanies Chloe as her cameraman, learn that Jameson is experimenting on meteor infected people in order to steal their abilities. Jameson, exhibiting the same jitters as Earl Jenkins, attempts to kill Chloe and Pete to hide what he has been doing, but his jitters become uncontrollable and he kills himself in his lab. As Chloe and Pete leave the lab they come across Lionel Luthor, leading Chloe to realize that Lionel was funding Jameson&#x27;s efforts.

The third volume of the &quot;Chloe Chronicles&quot;, titled &quot;Vengeance Chronicles&quot;, features Chloe teaming up with the &quot;Angel of Vengeance&quot; Andrea Rojas (Denise Quiñones), from season five&#x27;s &quot;Vengeance&quot;, to stop Lex Luthor. Andrea informs Chloe that Lex turned Lionel&#x27;s &quot;Level 3&quot; facility into his own &quot;33.1&quot; research lab. Rojas, working with meteor infected individuals Yang and Molly Griggs, wants Chloe&#x27;s help to expose LuthorCorp&#x27;s experimentation on the meteor infected.

===Young-adult novels===
Chloe&#x27;s first appearance in literature was in the Aspect published &quot;Smallville: Strange Visitors&quot;. Here, Chloe is conned into believing that Dr. Donald Jacobi, a &quot;faith healer&quot; is interested in her research on the meteor rocks. She quickly realizes, after attending one of Jacobi&#x27;s shows, that he is nothing more than a con artist, which causes her to devote her time to proving that so no one will fall victim to his schemes. In &quot;Smallville: Dragon&quot;, Chloe attempts to solve the murder of one of her teachers, Mr. Tait, which she and Clark believe to be the work of recently released convict Ray Dansk. While attending a party put on by Lex, Chloe is injured during an attack on the crowd by Dansk, who has turned into a reptilian creature thanks to exposure to the meteor rocks.

===Comic books===
====&quot;Smallville&quot;====
In 2012, the &quot;Smallville&quot; series was continued through the comic book medium with &quot;Smallville: Season 11&quot;. Written by Bryan Q. Miller, who also wrote for the television series, the first issue reveals that Chloe and Oliver Queen are living in Star City. Chloe is working for the &quot;Star City Gazette&quot;, but remains a friend and ally to the heroes. She and Lois discover a spacecraft in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, later revealing the pilot is Chloe&#x27;s counterpart from a parallel Earth (the same universe where Clark Luthor and alternate-Lionel Luthor were from). She was sent by her cousin, Lois Queen (the alternate version of Lois Lane and Clark&#x27;s ally of that world), to warn Clark of the coming &quot;Crisis&quot;, which destroyed her world. She dies after Oliver and Chloe take her to a hospital. After Chloe asks Lois to steal the components and plans of Lionel Luthor&#x27;s memory device, Project Intercept, with Oliver, Chloe had Emil Hamilton build it with upgrades so she can find information from the remnants of her deceased counterpart&#x27;s memories. Inside what is left of her counterpart&#x27;s mind, Chloe finds a universe coming to an end, caused by an attack led by a powerful gargantuan being; she also witnesses Lois Queen&#x27;s death. She finds she now has some of the memories of her counterpart, and discovers her killer is one of the Multiverse&#x27;s guardians, the Monitors. After taking a leave of absence with Oliver, Chloe later return as Clark begins to gather everyone to make a stand against The Monitors. At this point, Chloe is now about nine months pregnant. After the Monitors&#x27; defeat, Chloe and Oliver join the Department of Extranormal Operations. She later gives birth to a baby boy, whom she and Oliver named &quot;Jonathan&quot;, after Clark&#x27;s late-adoptive father Jonathan Kent.

====Other versions====
Although Chloe appeared alongside her television cohorts in the &quot;Smallville&quot; comic books, which featured tie-ins to the &quot;Chloe Chronicles&quot; webisodes, DC writers hoped to bring Chloe into DC continuity at least as early as 2007. The character ultimately made her first appearance in the mainstream DC Universe in 2010. According to writer Kurt Busiek, the problem of bringing Chloe into the mainstream comic book universe, and keeping her television background, was that she would have filled two roles: &quot;the Girl from Back Home and the Reporter&quot;. Those roles were already filled by the adult comic book versions of Lana Lang and Lois Lane, so the plan was to give the character a new background. Busiek hoped to make Chloe the younger sister of someone Clark had gone to school with, who was a now interning at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Busiek believed that this would make her different from Lana and Lois, but still familiar to readers who also watched the show. Another distinguishing feature would be that this version of Chloe would not know Clark&#x27;s secret, nor would she be meteor infected. These ideas never came to fruition.

Chloe first appeared in &quot;Jimmy Olsen&#x27;s Big Week&quot;, a serialized &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot; story written by Nick Spencer, beginning in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #893 (November 2010). Spencer stated that introducing Chloe has been his first &quot;positive contribution&quot; to the DC Universe. Because of the continuity differences between &quot;Smallville&quot; and the comic book Superman stories, Spencer chose to stay &quot;as true to the character&quot; as he could by honoring her romantic history with Jimmy Olsen from later &quot;Smallville&quot; seasons, as well as her journalistic background from its early seasons. Spencer decided to introduce Chloe after he began conceiving of a clever, dogged female reporter for Jimmy Olsen to interact with, and realized that he had been subconsciously writing about Chloe.

Chloe Sullivan is mentioned during a flashback in a season three episode of &quot;Supergirl&quot;, titled &quot;Midvale&quot;, where she helps a teenage Alex and Kara Danvers in solving a murder mystery of a classmate through email correspondence. Parallel to the original interpretation, she is referred to as Clark Kent&#x27;s best friend and knows his secrets and even has a &quot;Wall of Weird&quot;.

<text>The Castle of Salir () is an Almohad fortress, located in the civil parish of the same name (Salir (Loulé)), 16 kilometres from the municipality seat of Loulé in the Portuguese Algarve.

==History==
The castle is a late Islamic castle, built during a period of intense pressure from Christian forces. It was part of the a network of Almohad castles, an extensive line of coastal defenses that stretched into the interior from Castro Marim until Alcoutim. Salir was a rural defensive post, one of several that were aligned towards the interior: it was an advanced outpost. Its function was to protect the farmers from attacks by Christians, and which intensified after the conquest of Tavira by knights of the Order of Santiago. The construction of the castle occurred in the 12th century, but was King Sancho I of Portugal conquered the settlement in 1189. Ever mindful of Moorish counteroffensives, the walls were reinforced at the end of the 12th century. The majority of ceramics discovered on the site date to the period between the 12th and 13th century.

Salir enters the compiled documents of the &quot;Portugaliae Monumenta Historica&quot;, as the name of a place taken by commander Paio Peres Correia. The master was to await the arrival of Afonso (1248–1279) so that they could unite their forces and remove the last vestiges of resistance in the Algarve. Consequently, the fortification of Salir, within this context, had a strategic role. Later, a fire destroyed the castle, which was reconstructed two times, before actually falling into ruins.

Around 1505, there were less than 87 residential homes in Salir.

By the end of the 16th century, the castle was already abandoned and in a state of ruins.

In 1758, there were 11 homes in Salir, likely due to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake which caused damage to the castle and surrounding countryside.

The civil parish of São Sebastião de Salir had approximately 408 homes in 1798.

The slow deterioration of the castle was, by 1841, semi-complete, as reports from the site suggest that the structure was in ruins.

The first archaeological investigation of the castle and surroundings began in 1987.

Salir was elevated to the status of town in 1993.

===Legend===
Salir received its name, from the &quot;disappearance&quot; of the daughter of the Moorish alcalde Aben-Fabilla, so a legend suggests, who escaped when he saw his castle being threatened by the army of Afonso III. But, before fleeing, the alcalde buried all his gold, thinking that he could retrieve it later. When the Christians took the castle, they discovered it was empty, except for the beautiful daughter of the alcade who prayed with fervor, and who had preferred to stay in the castle and die a &quot;salir&quot;. From a nearby mountain, Aben-Fabilia saw his captive daughter in the hands of the Christians and with his right hand made a sign of the Star of David, uttering some mysterious words. At that moment, while the knight Gonçalo Peres was talking to the girl, she was transformed into a statue of rock. The news of the enchanted Moor permeated the castle. But, one day the statue disappeared. The memory of the strange event became linked to Salir, whose towns folk named the village in honour of the courageous youth. The legend concludes with the reflection that, on certain nights, the enchanted statue appears in the Castle.

==Architecture==
The castle is located in a rural, semi-mountainous isolated location, implanted in an elevated point in the Algarvean Barrocal, located north-northwest from the parish seat of Salir. It is situated in an area of ample visibility over the fertile valleys to the north and west. The elevated hilltop is 250 metres above sea level, relatively close to the highest points of the Serra do Caldeirão. Located to the east is the Roman archaeological site of Torrinha.

The castle is laid-out in a central, but irregular, plan in the form of oval. The articulated spaces are aligned horizontally, but with no roofing (except for the traditional home at its centre and interpretative center).

The main facade is oriented towards the south, where the slope is less accentuated. A main doorway is not identifiable, although there are indications that it was situated on the extreme southeast, corresponding to the principal access-way to the castle. There are five definable walls, defined by the main fate and four separate towers, all rectangular and some state of ruin. Tower &quot;D&quot;, also known as the &quot;Muro do Meio&quot; (&quot;Middle Wall&quot;) is in the northeast, in an area of accentuated slope, marked by a robust berm. The wall is little more than wide, that was almost completely destroyed in course of accessing the spaces; what remains is just a section . Tower &quot;C&quot;, known as the &quot;Torre da Alfarrobeira&quot; (&quot;Tower of the Carob Tree&quot;) is located in the northern flank of the castle, precisely at the point where the slope in relation to the valley is more accentuated. A three-metre () high section of this wall still remains, in size. Tower &quot;B&quot;, referred to as the &quot;Muro Maior&quot; (&quot;Major Wall&quot;) is along the northeastern flank, farthest from the main road, and a section that is similar to the rest, with the addition of buildings abutting along the east and south. The south tower is integrated into these constructions, and abutting the southeastern wall. There are also two sections, wide, that are conserved to about : in the north, that connect Tower &quot;D&quot; and Tower &quot;B&quot;, passing through &quot;C&quot;; and a small section in the southeast, known as the &quot;Muro da Sabedoria&quot; (&quot;Wall of Wisdom&quot;). This is all that is left of the circuit that encircles the castle and connected to the interior of the grounds.

The excavated area, east of Tower &quot;B&quot; consists of an irregular rectangular area where the discovery of a few constructions were first identified: specifically, they included a kitchen and living spaces dating to the period of the Moorish occupation of the castle.

The paths are gardened/landscaped with Portuguese pavement stone, limited the corners and towers, while bunks were deposited in the garden around Tower &quot;B&quot;.

It is difficult to determine the state of the original interiors, articulation of the spaces, illumination or ceilings, due to the state of decay. The principal artery is defined by the &quot;Travessa do Castelo&quot;, which parts from the main entrance southeast and terminates in the west, dividing the courtyard of the castle in half.

===Interpretative Center===
Located in the excavated area of the castle, east of Tower &quot;B&quot;, it is a rectangular building, with a simple single floor. The principal facade is oriented to the south, towards the public access-way, accessible by a double flight of stairs.

<text>The Bell X-5 was the first aircraft capable of changing the sweep of its wings in flight. It was inspired by the untested wartime P.1101 design of the German Messerschmitt company. In a further development of the German design, which could only have its wing sweepback angle adjusted on the ground, the Bell engineers devised a system of electric motors to adjust the sweep in flight.

==Design and development==
The Messerschmitt P.1101 V1 prototype was captured by United States troops in April 1945 from an experimental facility at Oberammergau, Germany. It was brought back to the United States, eventually being delivered to the Bell Aircraft factory at Buffalo, New York. Although incomplete and damaged in transit, company engineering staff studied the design closely. The P.1101 had a wing sweep that could be adjusted on the ground from 30, 40, to 45 degrees. However, this was for testing only and never intended as an operational feature. The Bell team, led by Chief Designer Robert J. Woods, submitted a proposal for a similar design, but with in-flight wing adjustment capability.

Although superficially similar, the X-5 was much more complex than the P.1101, with three sweep positions: 20°, 40° and 60°, creating an inflight &quot;variable-geometry&quot; platform. A jackscrew assembly moved the wing&#x27;s hinge along a set of short horizontal rails, using disc brakes to lock the wing into its inflight positions. Moving from full extension to full sweep took less than 30 seconds. The articulation of the hinge and pivots partly compensated for the shifts in center of gravity and center of pressure as the wings moved.

Even so, the X-5 had vicious spin characteristics arising from the aircraft&#x27;s flawed aerodynamic layout, particularly a poorly positioned tail and vertical stabilizer which, in some wing positions, could lead to an irrecoverable spin. This violent stall / spin instability would eventually cause the destruction of the second aircraft and the death of its Air Force test pilot in 1953.

The unfavorable spin characteristics also led to the cancellation of tentative plans by the United States Air Force to modify the X-5&#x27;s design into a low-cost tactical fighter for NATO and other foreign countries.

==Operational history==
Two X-5s were built (serial numbers 50-1838 and 50-1839). The first was completed 15 February 1951, and the two aircraft made their first flights on 20 June and 10 December 1951. Almost 200 flights were made at speeds up to Mach 0.9 and altitudes of . One aircraft was lost on 14 October 1953, when it failed to recover from a spin at 60° sweepback. Air Force Captain Ray Popson died in the crash at Edwards Air Force Base. The other X-5 remained at Edwards and continued active testing until 1955, and remained in service as a chase plane until 1958.

The X-5 successfully demonstrated the advantage of a swing-wing design for aircraft intended to fly at a wide range of speeds. Despite the X-5&#x27;s stability problems, the concept was developed to an outboard rather than inboard hinge, and was later successfully implemented in such aircraft as the General Dynamics F-111 and Grumman F-14 Tomcat, the Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-23 and MiG-27, the Sukhoi Su-17/20/22 and Su-24, the Tupolev Tu-22M and Tu-160, the Panavia Tornado and the Rockwell B-1 Lancer.

==Survivors==
The sole surviving X-5 is now at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. It was delivered to the museum in March 1958. It is displayed in the museum&#x27;s Research &amp; Development Hangar.

<text>HMS &quot;Galatea&quot; (F18) was a of the Royal Navy. She was built by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham on the Tyne. She was launched on 23 May 1963 and commissioned on 25 April 1964 and was the eighth ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name.

==First deployments==
Upon her commission, &quot;Galatea&quot; was immediately stationed in the Mediterranean Sea. The following year, &quot;Galatea&quot; was involved in exercises in that region, and in 1966 joined the 27th Escort Group which were also based in the Mediterranean. Later that year, &quot;Galatea&quot; returned to United Kingdom waters when she joined the Home Fleet. In 1968, &quot;Galatea&quot; was present with in West Germany during the Kiel Week event, which combines a yachting race and festival entertainment. In the same year she took part in Portsmouth &#x27;Navy Days&#x27;.

==Refitting and Cod Wars==
In 1971, &quot;Galatea&quot; began a period of refit and modernisation, which included the installation of the Ikara and Sea Cat weapons systems. The refit was completed in 1974. The following year, &quot;Galatea&quot; was engaged in operations during the Third Cod War with Iceland, patrolling against possible Icelandic interference with British fishing trawlers. On 26 March 1976, &quot;Galatea&quot; collided with the stern of the Icelandic Coast Guard vessel , damaging the frigate&#x27;s bow.

==&quot;Galatea&quot;″s last decade==
In 1977, &quot;Galatea&quot; underwent a refit after participating in a Fleet Review, in honour of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. &quot;Galatea&quot;, leader of the 1st Frigate Squadron, was positioned between her sister ship and the cruiser .

In 1978, &quot;Galatea&quot; returned to the Mediterranean, where a number of patrols and exercises were undertaken. Much of 1980 was spent in the Far East, but a planned nine-month deployment ended with the start of the Iran–Iraq War. In 1981, &quot;Galatea&quot; refitted in Gibraltar before deploying to the Persian Gulf on Armilla Patrol, where she remained until about 1983. The frigate decommissioned in January 1987 and was sunk as a target in July 1988, as part of naval exercises in the North Atlantic.

==Commanding officers==

Notable commanding officers include Henry Leach from 1965 to 1967 and Anthony (Tony) John Cooke between 1969 and 1971.

<text>A solid rocket [[booster (rocketry)|booster]] (SRB) is a solid propellant motor used to provide thrust in spacecraft launches from initial launch through the first ascent. Many launch vehicles, including the Atlas V, SLS and Space Shuttle, have used SRBs to give launch vehicles much of the thrust required to place the vehicle into orbit. 

The Space Shuttle used two Space Shuttle SRBs, which were the largest solid propellant motors ever built until the Space Launch System and the first designed for recovery and reuse. 
The propellant for each solid rocket motor on the Space Shuttle weighed approximately 500,000 kilograms.

==Advantages==

Compared to liquid propellant rockets, the solid-propellant motors (SRMs) have been capable of providing large amounts of thrust with a relatively simple design. They provide greater thrust without significant refrigeration and insulation requirements, and produce large amounts of thrust for their size. Adding detachable SRBs to a vehicle also powered by liquid-propelled rockets known as staging reduces the amount of liquid propellant needed and lowers the launch rig mass. Solid boosters are cheaper to design, test, and produce in the long run compared to the equivalent liquid propellant boosters. Reusability of components across multiple flights, as in the Shuttle assembly, also has decreased hardware costs.

One example of increased performance provided by SRBs is the Ariane 4 rocket. The basic 40 model with no additional boosters was capable of lifting a 4,795 lb (2,175 kg) payload to geostationary transfer orbit. The 44P model with 4 solid boosters has a payload of 7,639 lb (3,465 kg) to the same orbit.

==Disadvantages==
Solid propellant boosters are not controllable and must generally burn until exhaustion after ignition, unlike liquid propellant or cold-gas propulsion systems. However, launch abort systems and range safety destruct systems can attempt to cut off propellant flow by using shaped charges. estimates for SRB failure rates have ranged from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100,000. SRB assemblies have failed suddenly and catastrophically. Nozzle blocking or deformation can lead to overpressure or a reduction in thrust, while defects in the booster&#x27;s casing or stage couplings can cause the assembly to break apart by increasing aerodynamic stresses. Additional failure modes include bore choking and combustion instability. Failure of an O-ring seal on the &quot;Challenger&quot; space shuttle&#x27;s right solid rocket booster led to its disintegration shortly after liftoff.

Solid rocket motors can present a handling risk on the ground, as a fully fueled booster carries a risk of accidental ignition. Such an accident occurred in the August 2003 Brazilian rocket explosion at the Brazilian Centro de Lançamento de Alcântara VLS rocket launch pad, killing 21 technicians.

== Launchers that use solid rocket boosters ==
Some launchers use a fixed number of boosters :
* Space Launch System: two (SLS Solid Rocket Boosters)
* Space shuttle: two (Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters)
* Ariane 5: two (P241/P238) 
* LVM3 : two (S200)

Some launchers use a variable number of boosters depending on payload and target orbit :
* Atlas V: zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (GEM-63)
* Delta II. Often launched with 9 SRBs, but sometimes fewer.
* Delta IV Medium: zero, 2, or 4 Graphite-Epoxy Motors (GEM 60s) strap-on boosters 
* PSLV: 2, 4, or 6 (S9/S12) and S139 First Stage
* Ariane 6: two or four (P120C) 
* Vulcan Centaur: zero, 2, 4, or 6 (GEM 63XL)

<doc id="571415" wikidata="Q1070325" url="?curid=571415" title="Ice stock sport">
<text>Ice stock sport (also known as &quot;Icestocksport&quot; or &quot;Bavarian curling&quot;) is a winter sport, somewhat similar to curling. In German, it is known as Eisstockschießen. Although the sport is traditionally played on an ice surface, events are also held on tarmac in summer.

Competitors slide ice stocks over an ice surface, aiming for a target, or to cover the longest distance. Ice stocks have a gliding surface, to which a stick (ca 30 cm) is attached. The sport is mostly practised in southern Germany, Austria and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol in Italy.

Ice stock has been demonstrated at the Winter Olympic Games on two occasions. Ice stock is also an event in India&#x27;s Khelo India Winter Games program. The most recent world championship for Ice stock has been the 2022 Ice stock sport World Championships for Women and Men, held on February 22–27 February 2022 in Ritten, Italy in the central village of Klobenstein (Collalbo). It was the 14th time the event has taken place.

== History ==

The first written mention of ice stock sport came shortly before Christmas in 1192; messengers arrived to bring news of the capture of Richard the Lionheart to Leopold V, Duke of Austria, who was playing ice stock on the frozen river Danube at Vienna. The sport was probably also played in Scandinavia by the 13th century. The first paintings showing ice stock sport being played stem from the 16th century from the Alpine region and the Low Countries, with Brueghel&#x27;s &quot;The Hunters in the Snow&quot; from 1565 being an example. It would take until the 1930s before it became a formal sport. A German federation was established in 1934, and German championships were established two years later.

European Championships were first held in 1951, and World Championships were first held in 1983, after the International Federation Icestock Sport (IFI) had been established. Icestock World Championships has been held for men and women since 1983.

== Disciplines ==
There are several disciplines in ice stock sport, of which teams &quot;target shooting&quot;, &quot;individual target&quot; and &quot;distance shooting&quot; are contested in international championships.
=== Team Game ===

In a team game, two teams try to shoot the sticks as close as possible to the &quot;Daube&quot; from the starting point. The stave is placed on the center cross before the start of a turn. If the stave is changed in its position within the target field by an effect that is valid according to the rules, it remains in this new position, which is also decisive for the scoring. It is returned to the center cross if it is outside the target space. There are six turns in total.

A team usually consists of four players, with each player making one try per round. The aim is to get one of your own team&#x27;s sticks in the best position (i.e. closer to the stave than your opponent). Only sticks that are within the target field are scored.

One of the two teams starts the game by trying to play one of their sticks into the target field through the so-called measure. The opposing team then plays with the aim of getting one of their sticks in the best position. The positions of the sticks already in the target field may be changed by the new sticks. If a stick comes to a standstill outside of the target field, it will be removed. Opposing sticks that are in a better position may be shot out of the field.

The teams, called &quot;Moarschaft&quot; in the language of stick shooters, shoot until all sticks have been played, whereby it is always the team&#x27;s turn that does not currently have the best position to score. When both teams have played with all their sticks, the turn is over and the team whose stick is in the best position gets stick points. Three stick points are awarded for the stick in the best position, for each additional stick of the same team that is closer to the stave than the next stick of the opponent, there are two more points. If one or more sticks of the team that has a stick in the best position and whose turn it is because the opponent has no more sticks available does not reach or touch the field, three stick points are awarded for the first stick and two for all others points deducted. A game has six turns, i.e. passes. The face-off changes with each turn, regardless of the outcome of the last round. The team with the greater number of stock points receives two profit or game points, the other none. In the event of a tie, each team gets one point. The team with the most winning points wins the tournament. If two teams have the same number of winning points, the winner 

=== Team Target Shooting ===
The target competition is held in 4 rounds with 6 attempts each. Up to 60 points can be achieved in each round. For the overall ranking, 2 rounds (= 2 × 4 rounds) are usually played. In championships, the top-ranked players often play another 1 to 2 rounds in a final for victory. The target competition is held both as an individual competition and as a team competition. In the individual competition, one player plays all rounds and is scored individually. In the team competition, a different player plays each round. For the evaluation, the results of the individual players are added together.

1st round: 6 attempts are made on the middle target rings, in which the player&#x27;s stick should be brought as close as possible to the center cross. The ring that the stick reaches is counted. Rings count from outside to inside: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 points.

2nd round: 6 attempts are played on a target stick, which is placed alternately in the marked circles A to F. In the 6 attempts it is important to move the target stick placed in the circles out of the target field, whereby the player&#x27;s stick should remain in the target field. Depending on the final position of the poles, 0, 2, 5 or 10 points are awarded for each attempt.

3rd round: 3 attempts are made to the left and right rear target (target fragments), in which the player&#x27;s stick should be brought as close as possible to the center of the rings. The ring that the stick reaches is counted. Rings count from outside to inside: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 points.

4th round: 6 attempts are played on a target stick, which is placed in the marked circles A, B, G, H, E and F in sequence. In attempts 1 and 2, the goal is to hit the target stick in such a way that the player&#x27;s stick comes to a standstill as close as possible to the center cross. In attempts 3 and 4, the aim is to hit the shooting stick so that it comes to a standstill as close as possible to the center cross. In attempts 5 and 6, the aim is to move the shooting stick from the target rings to the rear rings. In attempts 1 to 6, the respective ring that the stick reaches is scored. The rings count 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 points from the outside to the inside.
=== Distance Competition ===
The technique of long-distance shooting differs significantly from that of team shooting, since it is not necessary to be precise in the length and direction of the shot, but to accelerate the stick as much as possible.

In the distance competition, a single player tries to shoot his stick as far as possible. The athlete has five attempts in the competition, the best of which counts. These must be delivered in a funnel-shaped path. If the stick leaves the lane, the attempt is only valid up to the point of departure. The dimensions of the track change depending on the season. The summer track on asphalt or concrete pavement is slightly narrower than the winter track on (natural) ice. The funnel can be extended as desired, which is also necessary when you consider that the world record is 566 m (achieved by Manfred Zieglgruber , SV Unterneukirchen (D) on Lake Seeon ).

The shooter stands on a stand in the middle of the semicircle when firing the shot. He has space to run out up to the 7 meter line, which is not a matter of course due to the momentum and the kinetic energy acting on the athlete.

All players use the same stick body and sole, but are allowed to use their own sticks. A team score can also be created by summing up the results of several players.

From the spectator&#x27;s point of view, this discipline has the advantage that even a layperson can judge whether an attempt was successful or not.

==Ice surface==
During the winter season, icestock sport uses a sheet of ice with areas marked off for play. The winter version uses either natural outdoor ice or an indoor ice rink with specific dimensions, lines, and markings for icestock.

== International Federation Icestocksport ==
The international governing body for the sport is the International Federation Icestocksport.

During the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Tokyo in 2021, the IOC approved full recognition of International Federation Icestocksport.

<text>Hallelujah ( ; , Modern ) is an interjection from the Hebrew language, used as an expression of gratitude to God. The term is used 24 times in the Tanakh (in the book of Psalms), twice in deuterocanonical books, and four times in the Christian Book of Revelation.

The phrase is used in Judaism as part of the Hallel prayers, and in Christian prayer, where since the earliest times it is used in various ways in liturgies, especially those of the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches and the Eastern Orthodox Church, the three of which use the Latin form alleluia which is based on the alternative Greek transliteration.

Hallelujah is a transliteration of (), which means &quot;praise ye Jah!&quot; (from , &quot;praise ye!&quot; and , &quot;Jah&quot;.) The word &quot;hallēl&quot; in Hebrew means a joyous praise in song. The second part, Yah, is a shortened form of YHWH (Yahweh or Jehovah in modern English).

==Interpretation==
In the Hebrew Bible &quot;hallelujah&quot; is actually a two-word phrase, &quot;hal(e)lu-Yah&quot;, and not one word. The first part, &quot;hallu&quot;, is the second-person imperative masculine plural form of the Hebrew verb &quot;hillel&quot;. The phrase &quot;hallelujah&quot; translates to &quot;praise Jah/Yah&quot;, though it carries a deeper meaning as the word &quot;halel&quot; in Hebrew means a joyous praise in song, to boast in God.

The second part, Yah, is a shortened form of YHWH, and is a shortened form of his name &quot;God, Jah, or Jehovah&quot;. The name ceased to be pronounced in Second Temple Judaism, by the 3rd century BC due to religious beliefs. The correct pronunciation is not known. However, it is sometimes rendered in non-Jewish sources as &quot;Yahweh&quot; or &quot;Jehovah&quot;. The Septuagint translates Yah as &quot;Kyrios&quot; (the , stylized in all-capitals in English), because of the Jewish custom of replacing the sacred name with &quot;Adonai&quot;, meaning &quot;my Lord&quot;.

The linguist Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann argues that the word &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is usually not replaced by a &quot;praise God!&quot; translation due to the belief in iconicity: the perception that there is something intrinsic about the relationship between the sound of the word and its meaning.

==In the Bible==
הַלְלוּיָהּ is found in 24 verses in the Book of Psalms (, , , ), but twice in Psalm 150:6. It starts and concludes a number of Psalms.

The Greek transliteration ἀλληλούϊα (&quot;allēlouia&quot;) appears in the Septuagint version of these Psalms, in and , and four times in
, the great song of praise to God for his triumph over the Whore of Babylon. It is this usage that Charles Jennens extracted for the Hallelujah Chorus in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. This transliteration is the basis of the alternative Latin transliteration &quot;Alleluia&quot; that is also used by Christians.

== Usage by Jews ==
The word &quot;hallelujah&quot; is sung as part of the Hallel Psalms (interspersed between Psalms 113–150). In Tractate Shabbat of the Talmud, Rabbi Yose is quoted as saying that the Pesukei dezimra Psalms should be recited daily. Psalms 145–150, also known as the Hallel of pesukei dezimra, are included to fulfill this requirement in the liturgy for the traditional Jewish Shacharit (morning) service. In addition, on the three Pilgrimage Festivals, the new moon and Hanukkah, Psalms 113-118 are recited. The latter psalms are known simply as Hallel with no additional qualification.

, ending with Halleluja, is the third and final biblical quotation in the Kedushah. This expanded version of the third blessing in the Amidah is said during the Shacharit and Mincha (morning and afternoon) services when there is a minyan present.

== Usage by Christians ==
For most Christians, &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is considered a joyful word of praise to God, rather than an injunction to praise him. The word &quot;Alleluia&quot;, a Latin derivative of the Hebrew phrase &quot;Hallelujah&quot; has been used in the same manner, though in Christian liturgy, the &quot;Alleluia&quot; specifically refers to a traditional chant, combining the word with verses from the Psalms or other scripture. In the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church, and in many older Protestant denominations, such as the Lutheran Churches, the Alleluia, along with the Gloria in excelsis Deo, is not spoken or sung in liturgy during the season of Lent, instead being replaced by a Lenten acclamation, while in Eastern Churches, Alleluia is chanted throughout Lent at the beginning of the Matins service, replacing the Theos Kyrios, which is considered more joyful. At the Easter service and throughout the Pentecostarion, Christos anesti is used in the place where Hallelujah is chanted in the western rite expressing happiness.

In day-to-day situations, the expressions of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; and &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; are used by Christians as spontaneous expressions of joy, thanksgiving and praise towards God. In contemporary worship services across denominational lines, the use of these jubilatory phrases require no specific prompting or call or direction from those leading times of praise and singing. In Methodist worship, &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; is a frequently used ejaculatory prayer.

== In popular culture ==
In modern English, &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is frequently spoken to express happiness that a thing hoped or waited for has happened. An example is its use in the song &quot;Get Happy&quot;.

&quot;Hallelujah&quot; was the winning song of the Eurovision Song Contest 1979, performed in Hebrew by Milk and Honey, including Gali Atari, for Israel.

Leonard Cohen&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;Hallelujah&quot; was initially rejected by Columbia Records for lacking commercial appeal, was popularized through covers by John Cale (1991) and Jeff Buckley (1994), achieved &quot;modern ubiquity&quot; after its inclusion in the animated movie &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001), and reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts upon Cohen&#x27;s death in 2016.

<text>Flavigny-sur-Ozerain () is a commune in the French department of Côte-d&#x27;Or, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.

The village was awarded membership in &quot;Les Plus Beaux Villages de France&quot; (&quot;France&#x27;s most beautiful villages&quot;).

==Geography==
The medieval village of Flavigny is situated on a rocky spur, surrounded by three streams: the Ozerain, the Recluse and the Verpant.

==History==
The first written mention of the village of Flavigny was in the Latin form of its name, &quot;Flaviniacum&quot;, which appears in the cartulary (or charter) of the Benedictine abbey founded on the site by a certain Widerard in 719. In the mid-9th century, in response to the increasing frequency of Viking raids, the relics of Saint Reine (or Santa Regina) were removed from the nearby town of Alise to Flavigny in the hopes that they could be better protected in a more fortified setting. The relics remain in Flavigny to this day, although they travel back to Alise every autumn for the celebration of the saint&#x27;s feast day in early September.

The town was prosperous during the Middle Ages, catering to large numbers of pilgrims, both those who came to visit the relics of Saint Reine and those on their way to Santiago de Compostela. By the 10th century, the abbey had grown into a town, with a parish church dedicated to St. Genest in addition to the abbey church (dedicated to St. Peter). During the 12th and 13th centuries, extensive fortifications were raised around the town. Large sections of these walls still surround the village to this day, including the Porte du Val, which includes both an inner gate dating to the 13th century and a 16th-century outer gate, and the 15th-century Porte du Bourg, with a statue of the Virgin. Despite these fortifications, Flavigny was taken and occupied by the English during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

In 1632 the Ursuline convent of Flavigny was founded, and in the early 18th century a new residence for the Abbot of Flavigny was constructed. However, by that time the abbacy had become corrupt and was held by a layman who had little to do with the town. At the time of the French Revolution, there may have been as few as five monks in residence. The abbey church was probably already in ruins, although local tradition holds that it suffered damage at the hands of revolutionaries. The parish church, St. Genest, emerged from the Revolution more or less unharmed.

In the 21st century, Flavigny has fewer than 400 year-round residents, although this number increases in the summer due to the substantial number of foreigners (British, Swiss, American, Australian, German) who have summer homes in the village. The abbey now houses the factory which manufactures Les Anis de Flavigny, small aniseed-flavored pastilles distributed worldwide. Various artists and artisans make their homes in the village, and it has become a popular tourist destination.

==Population==
==Sights==
*Flavigny Abbey
*The Jardin botanique textile is a botanical garden specializing in plants used for textiles, baskets, and rope.

==Economy==
Flavigny is the sole producer of the anise-flavored candy Anise de Flavigny, which was first produced by the monks.

==Film==
&quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000) was shot in Flavigny-sur-Ozerain.

==Religion==
Flavigny-sur-Ozerain is home to Saint Joseph de Clairval Abbey. The Benedictine monks there live according to the rule of St. Benedict and offer retreats for lay Catholics and workshops on desk top publishing and the manufacturing of icons. Flavigny also has a seminary of the Society of St. Pius X, a Traditionalist Catholic organisation, the Séminaire International Saint Curé d&#x27;Ars.

<text>Ernst Simon Bloch (; ; July 8, 1885 – August 4, 1977; pseudonyms: Karl Jahraus, Jakob Knerz) was a German Marxist philosopher. Bloch was influenced by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx, as well as by apocalyptic and religious thinkers such as Thomas Müntzer, Paracelsus, and Jacob Böhme. He established friendships with György Lukács, Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill, Walter Benjamin, and Theodor W. Adorno. Bloch&#x27;s work focuses on an optimistic teleology of the history of mankind.

==Life==
Bloch was born in Ludwigshafen, the son of a Jewish railway employee. After studying philosophy, he married Else von Stritzky, daughter of a Baltic brewer in 1913, who died in 1921. His second marriage with Linda Oppenheimer lasted only a few years. His third wife was Karola Piotrowska, a Polish architect, whom he married in 1934 in Vienna. When the Nazis came to power, the couple had to flee, first into Switzerland, then to Austria, France, Czechoslovakia, and finally the United States. He lived briefly in New Hampshire before settling in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was there, in the reading room of Harvard&#x27;s Widener Library, that Bloch wrote the lengthy three-volume work &quot;The Principle of Hope&quot;. He originally planned to publish it there under the title &quot;Dreams of a Better Life&quot;.

In 1948, Bloch was offered the chair of philosophy at the University of Leipzig, and he returned to East Germany to take up the position. In 1955 he was awarded the National Prize of the GDR. In addition, he became a member of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin (AdW). He had more or less become the political philosopher of the GDR. Among his many academic students from this period was his assistant Manfred Buhr, who earned his doctorate with him in 1957, and was later a professor in Greifswald, then director of the Central Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences (ADC) in Berlin and who became a critic of Bloch.

However, the Hungarian uprising in 1956 led Bloch to revise his view of the SED (Socialist Unity Party) regime, whilst retaining his Marxist orientation. Because he advocated humanistic ideas of freedom, he was obliged to retire in 1957 for political reasons – not because of his age, 72 years. A number of scientists and students spoke publicly against this forced retirement, among them the renowned professor and colleague Emil Fuchs and his students as well as Fuchs&#x27;s grandson Klaus Fuchs-Kittowski.

When the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, he did not return to the GDR, but went to Tübingen in West Germany, where he received an honorary chair in Philosophy. He engaged with a Christian-Marxist intellectual dialogue group organized by Milan Machovec and others in 1960s Czechoslovakia. He died in Tübingen.

==Thought==
Bloch was a highly original and eccentric thinker. Much of his writing—in particular, his magnum opus &quot;The Principle of Hope&quot;—is written in a poetic, aphoristic style. &quot;The Principle of Hope&quot; tries to provide an encyclopedic account of mankind&#x27;s and nature&#x27;s orientation towards a socially and technologically improved future. This orientation is part of Bloch&#x27;s overarching philosophy. Bloch believed the universe is undergoing a transition from its primordial cause (&quot;Urgrund&quot;) toward its final goal (&quot;Endziel&quot;). He believed this transition is effected through a subject-object dialectic, and he saw evidence for this process in all aspects of human history and culture.

==Influence==

Bloch&#x27;s work became influential in the course of the student protest movements in 1968 and in liberation theology. 
It is cited as a key influence by Jürgen Moltmann in his &quot;Theology of Hope&quot; (1967, Harper and Row, New York), by Dorothee Sölle, and by Ernesto Balducci. Psychoanalyst Joel Kovel has praised Bloch as, &quot;the greatest of modern utopian thinkers&quot;. Robert S. Corrington has been influenced by Bloch, though he has tried to adapt Bloch&#x27;s ideas to serve a liberal rather than a Marxist politics. Bloch&#x27;s concept of concrete utopias found in &quot;The Principle of Hope&quot; was used by José Esteban Muñoz to shift the field of performance studies. This shift allowed for the emergence of utopian performativity and a new wave of performance theorizing as Bloch&#x27;s formulation of utopia shifted how scholars conceptualize the ontology and the staging of performances as imbued with an enduring indeterminacy, as opposed to dominant performance theories found in the work of Peggy Phelan, who view performance as a life event without reproduction.

<doc id="571427" wikidata="Q5266973" url="?curid=571427" title="Deviancy amplification spiral">
<text>The deviancy amplification spiral and deviancy amplification are terms used by interactionist sociologists to refer to the way levels of deviance or crime can be increased by the societal reaction to deviance itself.

==Origin of term==
The process of deviancy amplification was first described by Leslie T. Wilkins.

==Process==
According to sociologist Stanley Cohen, the spiral starts with some deviant act. Usually the deviance is criminal, but it can also involve lawful acts considered morally repugnant by a large segment of society. With the new focus on the issue, hidden or borderline examples that would not themselves have been newsworthy are reported, confirming the pattern. This confirmation of the pattern was first documented by Stanley Cohen in &quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panic,&quot; a study of the media response to clashes between the Mods and Rockers, two rival subcultures of the time.

Reported cases of such deviance are often presented as the ones we know about, or the &quot;&quot;, an assertion that is nearly impossible to disprove immediately. For a variety of reasons, the less sensational aspects of the spiraling story that would help the public keep a rational perspective (such as statistics showing that the behavior or event is actually less common or less harmful than generally believed) tend to be ignored by the press.

As a result, minor problems begin to look serious and rare events begin to seem common. Members of the public are motivated to keep informed on these events, leading to high readership for the stories, feeding the spiral. The resulting publicity has the potential to increase the deviant behavior by glamorizing it, or by making it seem common or acceptable. In the next stage, public concern typically forces the police and the law enforcement system to focus more resources on dealing with the specific deviancy than it warrants.

Judges and magistrates then come under public pressure to deal out harsher sentences and politicians pass new laws to increase their popularity by giving the impression that they are dealing with the perceived threat. The responses by those in authority tend to reinforce the public&#x27;s fear, while the media continue to report police and other law enforcement activity, amplifying the spiral.

The theory does not contend that moral panics always include the deviancy amplification spiral.

Eileen Barker asserts that the controversy surrounding certain new religious movements can turn violent in a deviancy amplification spiral. In his autobiography, Lincoln Steffens details how news reporting can be used to create the impression of a crime wave where there is none, in the chapter &quot;I Make a Crime Wave&quot;.

Button and Tunley have also presented a theory that offers the opposite to deviancy amplification, which they call deviancy attenuation. In this, they argue using the case of fraud that there are some large problems which those in positions of power are able to seemingly attenuate through not accurately measuring them, leading to statistics which underestimate the problem, leading to fewer resources dedicated to them, reinforcing the belief of those in power that they are not a problem.

<doc id="571436" wikidata="Q6483918" url="?curid=571436" title="Land O'Lakes">
<text>Land O&#x27;Lakes, Inc. is an American member-owned agricultural cooperative based in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Arden Hills, Minnesota, United States, focusing on the dairy industry. The cooperative has 1,959 direct producer-members, 751 member-cooperatives, and about 9,000 employees who process and distribute products for about 300,000 agricultural producers, handling 12 billion pounds of milk annually. It is ranked third on the National Cooperative Bank Co-op 100 list of mutuals and cooperatives. The co-op is one of the largest producers of butter and cheese in the United States through its dairy foods business; serves producers, animal owners and their families through more than 4,700 local cooperatives, independent dealers and other large retailers through its Purina Animal Nutrition (Purina Mills) business; and delivers seed, crop protection products, agricultural services and agronomic insights to 1,300 locally owned and operated cooperative and independent agricultural retailers and their grower customers through its WinField United business.

== History ==
Land O&#x27;Lakes was founded on July 8, 1921, in Saint Paul, Minnesota, by representatives from 320 cooperative creameries as the Minnesota Cooperative Creameries Association. This organization aimed to improve the marketing practices and quality of butter, and thus increase the profitability of dairying.

The Association developed and implemented a systematic inspection, grading and certification system of butter from member creameries, resulting in greater uniformity of product. The improved quality and uniformity, and the reliability of its grading system, were touted in advertising materials. In 1924, the uniformly graded sweet cream butter was given the name &quot;Land O&#x27;Lakes&quot; after a contest, and the certificate forms used by the Association included the &quot;Land O Lakes&quot; marketing name (Minnesota&#x27;s state nickname is &quot;Land of 10,000 Lakes&quot;).

The name became popular enough that the organization&#x27;s public identity was often confused with its product name; thus, in 1926, the organization itself adopted the name &quot;Land O&#x27;Lakes Creameries, Inc.&quot; and became eponymous with its product.

The co-op was often accused of unfair competition and false advertising in its early years, and compelled to defend its inspection and certification processes. Eventually, however, the sweet butter marketing strategy drove competitors either to match the quality of butter produced under the Land O&#x27;Lakes name or see their sales decline. Many competitors in the dairy products business copied the Land O&#x27;Lakes approach, and the certification of quality became a proven marketing technique in other product lines as well. In the 1960s and 1970s, Land O&#x27;Lakes and Lake to Lake (which later merged into Land O&#x27;Lakes) had a rivalry with the National Farmers Organization over the practice of withholding milk from market. One member was expelled from Lake to Lake for recruiting other farmers into NFO.

===Recent history===
The Land O&#x27;Lakes co-op has grown through numerous acquisitions, and now has a large business in farm supply in addition to dairy:

In 1978, Land O&#x27;Lakes got into the meatpacking business with the purchase of Spencer Beef. It sold Spencer Beef in 1983 to Excel, now Cargill Meat Solutions.

In 1999, Land O&#x27;Lakes took an ownership stake in egg producer MoArk; it took full ownership of the company in 2006.

In 2001, it paid $360 million – and assumed $130 million in debt – to take over animal feed producer Purina Mills, once part of Ralston Purina. Purina Mills&#x27; new owner planned to merge the company with its Land O&#x27;Lakes Farmland Feed division but would keep the Purina name and logo.

A federal court in 2002 ordered Land O&#x27;Lakes to pay $3 million for patent infringement to Dr William Pordy, the inventor of a type of dairy creamer. An appeal court later overturned that ruling.

In August 2012, Land O&#x27;Lakes purchased refrigerated desserts manufacturer Kozy Shack Enterprises for an undisclosed sum.

In June 2016, Land O&#x27;Lakes acquired the Thousand Oaks, California-based biofuels firm Ceres, Inc.

In July 2018, Land O&#x27;Lakes named Beth Ford as its first female CEO. Ford&#x27;s role became effective August 1. At the time, she was the third openly gay woman CEO to run a Fortune 500 company.

In December 2019, Land O&#x27;Lakes used autonomous truck technology developed by Plus.ai to successfully complete the first cross-country, commercial freight run by a self-driving truck.

In 2020, the company started the American Connection Project along with Microsoft, Tractor Supply Co., and the Mayo Clinic to set up free wifi locations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Corporate affairs==
The company&#x27;s headquarters is in Arden Hills, Minnesota, in suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul.

==Butter packaging and controversy==

The Land O&#x27;Lakes indigenous woman, named Mia, holding the butter box was painted in 1928 by Brown &amp; Bigelow illustrator Arthur C. Hanson. According to Land O&#x27;Lakes, the original image of Mia was &quot;simplified and modernized&quot; in 1939 by Jess Betlach and has undergone many minor modifications since as the enduring logo of the co-op. Red Lake Ojibwe artist Patrick DesJarlait updated Mia&#x27;s image in the 1950s. DesJarlait publicly believe in fostering an open dialogue between Native Americans and non-Natives. Thus, Mia&#x27;s clothes were changed to match specific Ojibwe styles, and the background became a specific location in the Ojibwe territory, the Red Lake in Minnesota. The original image is an example of the infinite-loop motif or Droste effect, in which the image is repeated, in theory infinitely, within itself.

In 2018, the image was changed to depict only the head of the Native woman (doing away with the Droste effect). In February 2020, the company announced that after 92 years, it was removing the image of the Native American woman. The use of an indigenous woman as a mascot had been criticized as a racist stereotype, and the decision to change the label was praised by some Native advocates such as Peggy Flanagan, Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota and a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe. However, the move was not without controversy within the Native community.

DesJarlait&#x27;s son, Robert DesJarlait, disagreed with claims that the logo was offensive or stereotypical. &quot;Basically, it was giving the previous generation a sense of almost empowerment to see a Native woman on a box of butter. It gave them a sense of cultural pride,&quot; he said. &quot;After seeing those posts, I said, &#x27;that&#x27;s right, that&#x27;s why my dad created this image to begin with.

==Allegations of animal mistreatment by supplier==
In September 2009, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released an undercover video allegedly depicting animal abuse of dairy cows at a Pennsylvania supplier for Land O’Lakes, Inc. The video showed unclean conditions in the barn and milking parlor and cows with infections and illness. The supplier&#x27;s employee was found not guilty of animal cruelty charges resulting from this incident and an investigation by veterinarians hired by Land O’Lakes revealed no mistreatment of animals, but the veterinarians suggested that bedding, hygiene, ventilation and animal disposal practices be improved. Land O&#x27;Lakes states that it is supportive of the dairy industry&#x27;s National Dairy F.A.R.M.: Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) animal care standards.

In May 2017, the animal rights organization Animal Outlook (formerly Compassion Over Killing) released undercover footage of cruelty to animals at DFA supplier Mason Dixon Farms, which documented &quot;cows being kicked in the face, punched in their sensitive udders, excessively shocked with an electric prod, jabbed with a pens or elbows, and having their tails twisted or bent by workers.&quot; The footage resulted in the firing of one employee.

==Licensing==
Since August 2012, WhiteWave Foods has licensed the Land O&#x27;Lakes name and sold coffee creamers and fluid dairy products under the brand.

Land O&#x27;Lakes brand milk is licensed to Dean Foods in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin.

<doc id="571440" wikidata="Q478004" url="?curid=571440" title="Anti-clericalism">
<text>Anti-clericalism is opposition to religious authority, typically in social or political matters. Historically, anti-clericalism in Christian traditions has been opposed to the influence of Catholicism. Anti-clericalism is related to secularism, which seeks to separate the church from public and political life.

Some have opposed clergy on the basis of moral corruption, institutional issues and/or disagreements in religious interpretation, such as during the Protestant Reformation. Anti-clericalism became extremely violent during the French Revolution, because revolutionaries claimed the church played a pivotal role in the systems of oppression which led to it. Many clerics were killed, and French revolutionary governments tried to put priests under the control of the state by making them employees.

Anti-clericalism appeared in Catholic Europe throughout the 19th century, in various forms, and later in Canada, Cuba, and Latin America. According to the Pew Research Center several communist and post-communist states are current practitioners of political anti-clericalism, including Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Vietnam, China and North Korea.

==Europe==

During the Protestant Reformation, anti-clericalism resulted from opposition to the political and economic privileges of the clergy.

===France===
====Revolution====
The Civil Constitution of the Clergy was passed on July 12, 1790, requiring all clerics to swear allegiance to the French government and, by extension, to the increasingly anti-clerical National Constituent Assembly. All but seven of the 160 bishops refused the oath, as did about half of the parish priests. Persecution of the clergy and of the faithful was the first trigger of the rebellion; the second being conscription. Nonjuring priests were exiled or imprisoned and women on their way to Mass were beaten in the streets.

The anti-clericalism during the French Revolution initially began with attacks on church corruption and the wealth of the higher clergy, an action with which even many Christians could identify, since the Catholic Church held a dominant role in pre-revolutionary France. During a two-year period known as the Reign of Terror, the episodes of anti-clericalism grew more violent than Europe would see until the rise of state atheism in communist Eastern Europe. The new revolutionary authorities suppressed the church; abolished the Catholic monarchy; nationalized church property; exiled 30,000 priests and killed hundreds more. Many churches were converted into &quot;temples of reason&quot;, in which services were held. There has been much scholarly debate over whether the movement was popularly motivated. As part of the campaign to dechristianize France, in October 1793 the Christian calendar was replaced with one reckoning from the date of the Revolution, and Festivals of Liberty, Reason and the Supreme Being were scheduled. New forms of moral religion emerged, including the deistic Cult of the Supreme Being and France&#x27;s first established state sponsored atheistic Cult of Reason, with all churches not devoted to these being closed. In April and May 1794, the government mandated the observance of a festival of the Cult of the Supreme Being. When anti-clericalism became a clear goal of French revolutionaries, counter-revolutionaries seeking to restore tradition and the Ancien Régime took up arms, particularly in the War in the Vendée (1793 to 1796). Local people often resisted dechristianization and forced members of the clergy who had resigned to conduct Mass again. Eventually, Maximilien Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety denounced the dechristianization campaign and tried to establish their own religion, without the superstitions of Catholicism.

When Pope Pius VI took sides against the revolution in the First Coalition (1792–1797), Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy (1796). French troops imprisoned the Pope in 1797, and he died after six weeks of captivity.
After a change of heart, Napoleon then re-established the Catholic Church in France with the signing of the Concordat of 1801, and banned the Cult of the Supreme Being. Many anti-clerical policies continued. When Napoleonic armies entered a territory, monasteries were often sacked, and church property secularized.

====Third Republic====
A further phase of anti-clericalism occurred during the French Third Republic and its contention with the Catholic Church. After the Concordat of 1801 the Catholic Church enjoyed preferential treatment from the French state (formally equal with the Jewish, Lutheran and Calvinist minority religions, but in practice with much more influence). During the 19th century, public schools employed primarily priests as teachers, and religion was taught in schools (teachers also lead the class to Mass). This changed during the 1880s as several anti-clerical international gatherings took place in Paris, leading to the establishment of the Fédération nationale de la libre pensée, a strongly anti-clerical society uniting socialists, anarchists and liberals. In 1881–1882 Jules Ferry&#x27;s government passed the Jules Ferry laws, establishing free education (1881) and excluding clerics and religious education from schools (1882).
In 1880 and 1882 Benedictine teaching monks were effectively exiled. This was not completed until 1901.

A law of 7 July 1904 prevented religious congregations from sponsoring and conducting schools, and the Law on the separation of the Churches and the State of 1905, were enacted under the government of Radical-Socialist Émile Combes. Alsace-Lorraine was not subject to these laws, as it was part of the German Empire.

In the &quot;Affaire des Fiches&quot; (1904-1905), it was discovered that the anti-clerical War Minister of the Combes government, General Louis André, was determining promotions based on the French Masonic Grand Orient&#x27;s card index on public officials, detailing which were Catholic and who attended Mass, with a view to preventing the promotion of Catholics.

In the years following their relocation outside France, boarding schools of congregants were accused by some senators of trying to &quot;recruit&quot; French youth from abroad, supposedly placing the French Republic &quot;in jeopardy&quot;.

Republicans&#x27; anti-clericalism softened after the First World War as the Catholic right-wing began to accept the Republic and secularism as allies against socialism. In the present day, the issue of subsidized private schools, which are overwhelmingly Catholic but whose teachers draw pay from the state, remains a sensitive issue in French politics, and the &quot;Fédération Nationale de la Libre-Pensée&quot;, now commonly associated with the anti-clerical far-left, maintains its strongly anti-clerical stance.

===Austria (Holy Roman Empire)===
Emperor Joseph II (emperor 1765–1790) opposed what he called &quot;contemplative&quot; religious institutions – reclusive Catholic institutions that he perceived as doing nothing positive for the community. His policy towards them is included in what is called Josephinism.

Joseph decreed that Austrian bishops could not communicate directly with the Curia. More than 500 of 1,188 monasteries in Austro-Slav lands (and a hundred more in Hungary) were dissolved, and 60 million florins taken by the state. This wealth was used to create 1,700 new parishes and welfare institutions.

The education of priests was taken from the Church as well. Joseph established six state-run &quot;General Seminaries&quot;. In 1783, a Marriage Patent treated marriage as a civil contract rather than a religious institution.

Catholic historians have claimed that there was an alliance between Joseph and anti-clerical Freemasons.

===Germany===
The &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (literally &quot;culture struggle&quot;) refers to German policies in reducing the role and power of the Catholic Church in Prussia, enacted from 1871 to 1878 by the Prime Minister of Prussia, Otto von Bismarck.

Bismarck accelerated the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;, which did not extend to the other German states such as Bavaria (where Catholics were in a majority). As one scholar put it, &quot;the attack on the church included a series of Prussian, discriminatory laws that made Catholics feel understandably persecuted within a predominantly Protestant nation.&quot; Jesuits, Franciscans, Dominicans and other orders were expelled in the culmination of twenty years of anti-Jesuit and antimonastic hysteria.

In 1871, the Catholic Church comprised 36.5% of the population of the German Empire, including millions of Germans in the west and South, as well as the vast majority of Poles. In this newly founded Empire, Bismarck sought to appeal to liberals and Protestants (62% of the population) by reducing the political and social influence of the Catholic Church.

Priests and bishops who resisted the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; were arrested or removed from their positions. By the height of anti-Catholic measures, half of the Prussian bishops were in prison or in exile, a quarter of the parishes had no priest, half the monks and nuns had left Prussia, a third of the monasteries and convents were closed, 1800 parish priests were imprisoned or exiled, and thousands of laypeople were imprisoned for helping the priests.

The Kulturkampf backfired, as it energized the Catholics to become a political force in the Centre party and revitalized Polish resistance. The &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; ended about 1880 with a new pope Leo XIII willing to negotiate with Bismarck. Bismarck broke with the Liberals over religion and over their opposition to tariffs; He won Centre party support on most of his conservative policy positions, especially his attacks against socialism.

===Italy===
Anti-clericalism in Italy is connected with reaction against the absolutism of the Papal States, overthrown in 1870. For a long time, the pope required Catholics not to participate in the public life of the Kingdom of Italy that had invaded the Papal States to complete the unification of Italy, prompting the pope to declare himself a &quot;prisoner&quot; in the Vatican. Some politicians that had played important roles in this process, such as Giuseppe Garibaldi and Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, were known to be hostile to the temporal and political power of the Church. Throughout the history of Liberal Italy, relations between the Italian government and the Church remained acrimonious, and anti-clericals maintained a prominent position in the ideological and political debates of the era. Tensions eased between church and state in the 1890s and early 1900s as a result of both sides&#x27; mutual hostility toward the burgeoning Socialist movement. Initially also anticlerical, fascist Benito Mussolini tempered such rhetoric to win support from Catholics and later as dictator, official hostility between the Holy See and the Italian state was finally settled by Pope Pius XI and him: the Lateran Accords were finalised in 1929.

After World War II, anti-clericalism was embodied by the Italian Communist (PCI) and Italian Socialist (PSI) parties, in opposition to the Vatican-backed party Christian Democracy (DC). Since the PSI joined DC-led coalition governments, the DC under Aldo Moro turned centre-left. In 1978, with support of the PSI, the DC-led coalition government legalized abortion despite strong opposition from the Catholic Church and DC conservative factions.

The revision of the Lateran treaties during the 1980s by the PSI Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, removed the status of &quot;official religion&quot; of the Catholic Church, but still granted a series of provisions in favour of the Church, such as the eight per thousand law, the teaching of religion in schools, and other privileges.

In recent years, the Italian society has got increasingly secularized and many contest the intervention of the Catholic Church in Italian politics, usually through voting instructions to the faithful and to Catholic parliamentarians on the legislative and regulatory action of the State. For example, the positions of Cardinal Camillo Ruini in the 2005 Italian fertility laws referendum attracted criticism, and so did his opposition to a 2007 bill that would have provided recognition of same-sex unions in Italy. From the side of the Church, a right to express its opinions and a moral duty in guiding Christians on ethical questions is claimed.

===Poland===
Your Movement is an anti-clerical party founded in 2011 by politician Janusz Palikot. Palikot&#x27;s Movement won 10% of the national vote at the 2011 Polish parliamentary election.

In modern Polish media anti-clericalism is/was promoted by magazine NIE and Roman Kotliński&#x27;s newspaper .

===Portugal===

The fall of the Monarchy in the Republican revolution of 1910 led to another wave of anti-clerical activity. Most church property was put under State control, and the church was not allowed to inherit property. The revolution and the republic allegedly took a &quot;hostile&quot; approach to the issue of church and state separation, like that of the French Revolution, the Spanish Constitution of 1931 and the Mexican Constitution of 1917. As part of the anti-clerical revolution, the bishops were driven from their dioceses, the property of clerics was seized by the state, wearing of the cassock was banned, all minor seminaries were closed and all but five major seminaries. A law of February 22, 1918, permitted only two seminaries in the country, but they had not been given their property back. Religious orders were expelled from the country, including 31 orders comprising members in 164 houses (in 1917 some orders were permitted to form again). Religious education was prohibited in both primary and secondary school. Religious oaths and church taxes were also abolished.

===Spain===
The first instance of anti-clerical violence due to political conflict in 19th-century Spain occurred during the Trienio Liberal (Spanish Civil War of 1820–1823). During riots in Catalonia, 20 clergymen were killed by members of the liberal movement in retaliation for the Church&#x27;s siding with absolutist supporters of Ferdinand VII.

In 1836 following the First Carlist War, the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal () promulgated by Juan Álvarez Mendizábal, prime minister of the new regime abolished the major Spanish Convents and Monasteries.

Many years later the Radical Republican Party leader Alejandro Lerroux would distinguish himself by his inflammatory pieces of opinion.

==== Red Terror ====

The Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931 was based on secular principles. In the first years some laws were passed secularising education, prohibiting religious education in the schools, and expelling the Jesuits from the country. On Pentecost 1932, Pope Pius XI protested against these measures and demanded restitution. He asked the Catholics of Spain to fight with all legal means against the injustices. June 3, 1933, he issued the encyclical Dilectissima Nobis, in which he described the expropriation of all Church buildings, episcopal residences, parish houses, seminaries and monasteries.

By law, they were now property of the Spanish State, to which the Church had to pay rent and taxes continuously in order to use these properties. &quot;Thus the Catholic Church is compelled to pay taxes on what was violently taken from her&quot;. Religious vestments, liturgical instruments, statues, pictures, vases, gems and other valuable objects were expropriated as well.

During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, Catholics largely supported Franco and the Nationalist forces. Anti-clerical assaults called the Red Terror by Nationalists, included sacking and burning monasteries and churches and killing 6,832 members of the clergy.

This number comprises:
* 13 bishops (from the dioceses of Sigüenza, Lleida, Cuenca, Barbastro Segorbe, Jaén, Ciudad Real, Almería, Guadix, Barcelona, Teruel and the auxiliary of Tarragona);
* 4,172 diocesan priests;
* 2,364 monks and friars, among them 259 Clarentians, 226 Franciscans, 204 Piarists, 176 Brothers of Mary, 165 Christian Brothers, 155 Augustinians, 132 Dominicans, and 114 Jesuits.
* 283 nuns, according to one source, some of whom were badly tortured.

There are accounts of Catholic faithful being forced to swallow rosary beads, thrown down mine shafts and priests being forced to dig their own graves before being buried alive. The Catholic Church has canonized several martyrs of the Spanish Civil War and beatified hundreds more.

Prior to the Falangists joining Francisco Franco&#x27;s unified alliance of right-wing parties, the party exhibited anti-clerical tendencies, and saw the Catholic Church as an elite institution that presented an obstacle to the Falangist&#x27;s full control the state. Despite this, the Falangists had not been involved in any massacres of Catholics, and it went on to support the Church as a result of their alliance to monarchists and other nationalist movements.

==Philippines==

Philippine anti-clericalism is rooted in the anti-clericalism of 19th-century Spain. José Rizal, a member of the &quot;ilustrado&quot; class during the Spanish colonial period and one of the most prominent of the Philippines&#x27; national heroes held anti-clerical views until his eventual recantation before his day of execution. The Katipunan, the secret society that spearheaded the Philippine Revolution after Rizal&#x27;s execution, was also noted for its anti-clericalism. After Philippine independence was recognized by the United States, the inclusion of Rizal&#x27;s novels &quot;Noli me tangere&quot; and &quot;El filibusterismo&quot; in the country&#x27;s formal-education curricula was strongly opposed by the domestic Catholic Church hierarchy.

Rodrigo Duterte, the country&#x27;s previous president, has adopted a combative verbal stance toward the Church hierarchy and its staunchest supporters. In 2015, he blamed and cursed Pope Francis for the traffic congestion in the national capital; he later apologized and clarified that it was the government&#x27;s fault and not the pope&#x27;s. In 2019, he predicted the Church&#x27;s temporal demise in 25 years. Duterte, however, has underscored that his animosity toward the Church was purely personal and warned the otherwise uninvolved public against taking unethical action against the clergy.

== Canada ==
In French Canada following the Conquest, much like in Ireland or Poland under foreign rule, the Catholic Church was the sole national institution not under the direct control of the British colonial government. It was also a major marker of social difference from the incoming Anglo-Protestant settlers. French Canadian identity was almost entirely centred around Catholicism, and to a much lesser extent the French language. However, there was a small anti-clerical movement in French Canada in the early nineteenth drawing inspiration from American and French liberal revolutions. This group was one current (but by no means the dominant) one in the and its associated Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. In the more democratic politics that followed the rebellions, the more radical and anti-clerical tendency eventually formed the in 1848.

At the same time in English Canada, a related phenomenon occurred where the primarily Nonconformist (mostly Presbyterian and Methodist) Reform movement conflicted with an Anglican establishment. In Upper Canada, The Reform Movement began as protest against the &quot;establishment&quot; of the Anglican church.

The vastly different religious backgrounds of the Reformers and rouges was one of the factors which prevented them from working together well during the era of two-party coalition government in Canada (1840–1867). By 1861, however, the two groups fused to create a united Liberal block. After 1867, this party added like-minded reformers from the Maritime provinces, but struggled to win power, especially in still strongly-Catholic Quebec.

Once Wilfrid Laurier became party leader, however, the party dropped its anti-clerical stance and went on to dominate Canadian politics throughout most of the 20th century. Since that time, Liberal prime ministers have been overwhelmingly Catholic (St. Laurent, both Pierre and Justin Trudeau, Chrétien, Martin), but since the 1960s Liberals have again had a strained relationship with the Catholic church, and have increasingly parted with the Catholic church&#x27;s teachings on sexual morality, as when Pierre Trudeau legalized homosexuality and streamlined divorce (as justice minister under Pearson), and Martin legalized same-sex marriage.

In Quebec itself, the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s broke the hold of the church on provincial politics. The Quebec Liberal Party embraced formerly taboo social democratic ideas, and the state intervened in fields once dominated by the church, especially health and education, which were taken over by the provincial government. Quebec is now considered Canada&#x27;s most secular province.

== United States ==
Although anti-clericalism is more often spoken of regarding the history or current politics of Latin countries where the Catholic Church was established and where the clergy had privileges, Philip Jenkins notes in his 2003 book &quot;The New Anti-Catholicism&quot; that the U.S., despite the lack of Catholic establishments, has always had anti-clericals.

==Latin America==

Of the population of Latin America, about 71% acknowledge allegiance to the Catholic Church. Consequently, about 43% of the world&#x27;s Catholics inhabit the &#x27;Latin&#x27; countries of South, Central and North America.

The slowness to embrace religious freedom in Latin America is related to its colonial heritage and to its post-colonial history. The Aztec, Maya and Inca cultures made substantial use of religious leaders to ideologically support governing authority and power. This pre-existing role of religion as ideological adjunct to the state in pre-Columbian culture made it relatively easy for the Spanish conquistadors to replace native religious structures with those of a Catholicism that was closely linked to the Spanish throne.

Anti-clericalism was a common feature of 19th-century liberalism in Latin America. This anti-clericalism was often purportedly based on the idea that the clergy (especially the prelates who ran the administrative offices of the Church) were hindering social progress in areas such as public education and economic development.

Beginning in the 1820s, a succession of liberal regimes came to power in Latin America. Some members of these liberal regimes sought to imitate the Spain of the 1830s (and revolutionary France of a half-century earlier) in expropriating the wealth of the Catholic Church, and in imitating the 18th-century benevolent despots in restricting or prohibiting the religious orders. As a result, a number of these liberal regimes expropriated Church property and tried to bring education, marriage and burial under secular authority. The confiscation of Church properties and changes in the scope of religious liberties (in general, increasing the rights of non-Catholics and non-observant Catholics, while licensing or prohibiting the orders) generally accompanied secularist and governmental reforms.

=== Mexico ===

The Mexican Constitution of 1824 had required the Republic to prohibit the exercise of any religion other than the Catholic faith.

==== Reform War ====
Starting in 1855, President Benito Juárez issued decrees nationalizing church property, separating church and state, and suppressing religious orders. Church properties were confiscated and basic civil and political rights were denied to religious orders and the clergy.

==== Cristero War ====
More severe laws called Calles Law during the rule of Plutarco Elías Calles eventually led to the Cristero War, an armed peasant rebellion supported by the Catholic Church, against the Mexican government.

Following the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the new Mexican Constitution of 1917 contained further anti-clerical provisions. Article 3 called for secular education in the schools and prohibited the Church from engaging in primary education; Article 5 outlawed monastic orders; Article 24 forbade public worship outside the confines of churches; and Article 27 placed restrictions on the right of religious organizations to hold property. Article 130 deprived clergy members of basic political rights. Many of these laws were resisted, leading to the Cristero Rebellion of 1927–1929. The suppression of the Church included the closing of many churches and the killing of priests. The persecution was most severe in Tabasco under the atheist&quot; governor Tomás Garrido Canabal.

The church-supported armed rebellion only escalated the violence. US Diplomat Dwight Morrow was brought in to mediate the conflict. But 1928 saw the assassination of President Alvaro Obregón by Catholic radical José de León Toral, gravely damaging the peace process.

The war had a profound effect on the Church. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed. Between 1926 and 1934, over 3,000 priests were exiled or assassinated.

Where 4,500 priests served the people before the rebellion, in 1934 there were only 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion and assassination. It appears that ten states were left without any priests.

The Cristero rebels committed their share of violence, which continued even after formal hostilities had ended. In some of the worst cases, public school teachers were tortured and murdered by the former Cristero rebels. It is calculated that almost 300 rural teachers were murdered in this way between 1935 and 1939.

=== Ecuador ===
This issue was one of the bases for the lasting dispute between Conservatives, who represented primarily the interests of the Sierra and the church, and the Liberals, who represented those of the Costa and anti-clericalism. Tensions came to a head in 1875 when the conservative President Gabriel García Moreno, after being elected to his third term, was allegedly assassinated by anti-clerical Freemasons.

=== Colombia ===
Colombia enacted anti-clerical legislation and its enforcement during more than three decades (1849–84).

La Violencia refers to an era of civil conflict in various areas of the Colombian countryside between supporters of the Colombian Liberal Party and the Colombian Conservative Party, a conflict which took place roughly from 1948 to 1958.

Across the country, militants attacked churches, convents, and monasteries, killing priests and looking for arms, since the conspiracy theory maintained that the religious had guns, and this despite the fact that not a single serviceable weapon was located in the raids.

When their party came to power in 1930, anti-clerical Liberals pushed for legislation to end Church influence in public schools. These Liberals held that the Church and its intellectual backwardness were responsible for a lack of spiritual and material progress in Colombia. Liberal-controlled local, departmental and national governments ended contracts with religious communities who operated schools in government-owned buildings, and set up secular schools in their place. These actions were sometimes violent, and were met by a strong opposition from clerics, Conservatives, and even a good number of more moderate Liberals.

=== Argentina ===
The original Argentine Constitution of 1853 provided that all Argentine presidents must be Catholic and stated that the duty of the Argentine congress was to convert the Indians to Catholicism. All of these provisions have been eliminated with the exception of the mandate to &quot;sustain&quot; Catholicism.

Liberal anti-clericalists of the 1880s established a new pattern of church-state relations in which the official constitutional status of the Church was preserved while the state assumed control of many functions formerly the province of the Church. Conservative Catholics, asserting their role as definers of national values and morality, responded in part by joining in the rightist religio-political movement known as Catholic Nationalism which formed successive opposition parties. This began a prolonged period of conflict between church and state that persisted until the 1940s when the Church enjoyed a restoration of its former status under the presidency of Colonel Juan Perón. Perón claimed that Peronism was the &quot;true embodiment of Catholic social teaching&quot; – indeed, more the embodiment of Catholicism than the Catholic Church itself.

In 1954, Argentina saw extensive destruction of churches, denunciations of clergy and confiscation of Catholic schools as Perón attempted to extend state control over national institutions.

The renewed rupture in church-state relations was completed when Perón was excommunicated. However, in 1955, he was overthrown by a military general who was a leading member of the Catholic Nationalist movement.

=== Venezuela ===
In Venezuela, the government of Antonio Guzmán Blanco (in office from 1870 to 1877, from 1879 to 1884, and from 1886 to 1887) virtually crushed the institutional life of the church, even attempting to legalize the marriage of priests. These anti-clerical policies remained in force for decades afterward.

=== Cuba ===
Cuba, under the rule of atheist Fidel Castro, succeeded in reducing the Church&#x27;s ability to work by deporting the archbishop and 150 Spanish priests, by discriminating against Catholics in public life and education and by refusing to accept them as members of the Communist Party. The subsequent flight of 300,000 people from the island also helped to diminish the Church there.

== State atheism ==
A number of countries have practiced state atheism. Most of them, though not all, were communist states. In the Soviet Union, anti-clericalism was expressed through the state; in the first five years alone after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.

== Anti-clericalism in the Islamic world ==
In various traditions of Islam, Muslims who are not experts in Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) are ought to follow the instructions of an expert, i.e., a mujtahid, (with the exception of &quot;matters of belief&quot; or &quot;usulu &#x27;d-din&quot;). This deference is known as taqlid or &quot;imitation” and is meant for experts in a broad range of matters. In practice this means asking a cleric trained in Islamic law for a fatwa or ‘legal opinion’ on the issue the Muslim is concerned about. This ties into the significance of local customs and practices, known as urf, in the context of Sunni Islam, which does not have a formal clergy. 

Shia Islam, on the other hand, has had a doctrine of a centralized clergy in the imamate. Thus, by extension, the practice of taqlid has historically been more systematic. For example, as of the 19th century the Shia &quot;ulama&quot; taught believers to turn to the highest ranking clerics, known as &quot;sources of &quot;taqlid&quot;&quot; (&quot;marja&#x27; at-taqlid&quot;).

Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran—the one Muslim country where Shia form an overwhelming majority—even more systematic power was given to clerics. Under the doctrine of rule by Islamic jurists, or velayat-e faqih, Islamic clerics must rule or Islam will whither away. A cleric is head of state in Iran, and clerics control many powerful governmental positions.

=== Iran ===

During the first democratic revolution of Asia, the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, the Shia Marja Akhund Khurasani and his colleagues theorized a model of religious secularity in the absence of Imam, that still prevails in Shia seminaries. In absence of the ideal ruler, that is Imam al-Mahdi, democracy was the best available option. He considers opposition to constitutional democracy as hostility towards the twelfth Imam. He declared his full support for constitutional democracy and announced that objection to &quot;foundations of constitutionalism&quot; was un-Islamic. According to Akhund, &quot;a rightful religion imposes conditions on the actions and behavior of human beings&quot;, which stem from either holy text or logical reasoning, and these constraints are essentially meant to prevent despotism. He believes that an Islamic system of governance can not be established without the infallible Imam leading it. Thus the clergy and modern scholars have concluded that a proper legislation can help reduce the state tyranny and maintain peace and security. He said:

As &quot;sanctioned by sacred law and religion&quot;, Akhund believes, a theocratic government can only be formed by the infallible Imam. Aqa Buzurg Tehrani also quoted Akhund Khurasani saying that if there was a possibility of establishment of a truly legitimate Islamic rule in any age, God must end occultation of the Imam of Age. Hence, he refuted the idea of absolute guardianship of jurist. Therefore, according to Akhund, Shia jurists must support the democratic reform. He prefers collective wisdom () over individual opinions, and limits the role of jurist to provide religious guidance in personal affairs of a believer. He defines democracy as a system of governance that enforces a set of &quot;limitations and conditions&quot; on the head of state and government employees so that they work within &quot;boundaries that the laws and religion of every nation determines&quot;. Akhund believes that modern secular laws complement traditional religion. He asserts that both religious rulings and the laws outside the scope of religion confront &quot;state despotism&quot;. Constitutionalism is based on the idea of defending the &quot;nation&#x27;s inherent and natural liberties&quot;, and as absolute power corrupts, a democratic distribution of power would make it possible for the nation to live up to its full potential.

In 1925, Rezā Khan proclaimed himself shah of the country. As part of his Westernization program, the traditional role of the ruling clergy was minimized; Islamic schools were secularized, women were forbidden to wear the hijab, sharia law was abolished, and men and women were desegregated in educational and religious environments. All this infuriated the ultraconservative clergy as a class. Rezā Khan&#x27;s son and heir Mohammad Reza Pahlavi continued such practices. They ultimately contributed to the Islamic Revolution of 1978–79, and the Shah&#x27;s flight from his country.

When Ayatollah Khomeini took power a month after the revolution, the Shah&#x27;s anti-clerical measures were largely overturned, replaced by an Islamic Republic based on the principle of rule by Islamic jurists, velayat-e faqih, where clerics serve as heads of state and judges, veto legislation they consider un-Islamic and control who may run for president or parliament. However, by the late 1990s and 2000s, anti-clericalism was reported to be significant in the Islamic Republic of Iran:

Demonstrators using slogans such as &quot;The clerics live like kings while we live in poverty!&quot; One report claims &quot;Working-class Iranian lamented clerical wealth in the face of their own poverty,&quot; and &quot;stories about Swiss bank accounts of leading clerics circulated on Tehran&#x27;s rumor mill.&quot;

=== Indonesia ===

During the fall of Suharto in 1998, a witch hunt in Banyuwangi against alleged sorcerers spiraled into widespread riots and violence. In addition to alleged sorcerers, Islamic clerics were also targeted and killed, Nahdlatul Ulama members were murdered by rioters.

== Certain branches of Freemasonry ==
According to the 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Freemasonry was historically viewed by the Catholic Church as being a principal source of anti-Clericalism – especially in, but not limited to, historically Catholic countries.

<doc id="571462" wikidata="Q1422977" url="?curid=571462" title="National Museum of the United States Air Force">
<text>The National Museum of the United States Air Force (formerly the United States Air Force Museum) is the official museum of the United States Air Force located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, northeast of Dayton, Ohio. The NMUSAF is the oldest and largest military aviation museum in the world, with more than 360 aircraft and missiles on display. The museum is a central component of the National Aviation Heritage Area. The museum draws about a million visitors each year, making it one of the most frequently visited tourist attractions in Ohio.

==History==
The museum dates to 1923, when the Engineering Division at Dayton&#x27;s McCook Field first collected technical artifacts for preservation. In 1927, it moved to then-Wright Field in a laboratory building. In 1932, the collection was named the Army Aeronautical Museum and placed in a WPA building from 1935 until World War II. In 1948, the collection remained private as the Air Force Technical Museum. In 1954, the Air Force Museum became public and was housed in its first permanent facility, Building 89 of the former Patterson Field in Fairborn, which had been an engine overhaul hangar. Many of its aircraft were parked outside and exposed to the weather.

Through the 1960s, Eugene Kettering, son of Charles F. Kettering, led the project to build a permanent structure to house the collections and became the first chairman of the board of the Air Force Museum Foundation. When he died in 1969, his widow Virginia took over the project. Her &quot;determination, logic and meticulous attention&quot; kept it on track, and the current facility opened in 1971. Not including its annex on Wright Field proper, the museum has more than tripled in square footage since 1971, with the addition of a second hangar in 1988, a third in 2003, and a fourth in 2016.

In October 2004, the name changed from United States Air Force Museum to National Museum of the United States Air Force.

In June 2016, the museum open its fourth building that expanded the museum to the current of exhibit space. The fourth building houses the Space Gallery, Presidential Aircraft Gallery, and Global Reach Gallery. With the additional space, more than 70 aircraft that were in storage have been put back on display, such as the XB-70 Valkyrie. The Presidential Aircraft collection is also back on site, having been moved to an outside location for some time. The Air Force Museum Foundation funded the construction entirely with private donations from several different sources at a cost of $40.8 million (equivalent to $ in ).

On 28 February 2024, a tornado touched down in the Riverside area in Montgomery County, Ohio. The museum was struck by the tornado causing damage. The base commander, Col. Travis Pond, said that &quot;the damage was isolated to the southern side of Area B. Damaged buildings included the Museum’s Restoration Hangar 4, Gate 22B, and other nearby facilities.&quot;

==Exhibits and collections==
The museum is divided into galleries that cover broad historic trends in military aviation. These are further broken down into exhibits that detail specific historical periods and display aircraft in historical context.

The museum&#x27;s collection contains many rare aircraft of historical or technological importance, and various memorabilia and artifacts from the history and development of aviation. Among them is the Apollo 15 Command Module &quot;Endeavour&quot; which orbited the Moon 74 times in 1971, one of four surviving Convair B-36 Peacemakers, the only surviving North American XB-70 Valkyrie and &quot;Bockscar&quot;—the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that dropped the Fat Man atomic bomb on Nagasaki during the last days of World War II.

In 2010, the museum launched its 360-degree Virtual Tour, allowing most aircraft and exhibits to be viewed online.

In 2018, the Boeing B-17F &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; was placed on permanent public display in the World War II Gallery. The aircraft and its crew became iconic symbols of the heavy bomber crews and support personnel who helped defeat Nazi Germany.

===Presidential aircraft===
The museum has several Presidential aircraft, including those used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The centerpiece of the presidential aircraft collection is SAM 26000, a modified Boeing 707 known as a VC-137C, used regularly by presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon. This aircraft took President and Mrs. Kennedy to Dallas on 22 November 1963—the day of the President&#x27;s assassination. Vice President Johnson was sworn in as president aboard it shortly after the assassination, and the aircraft then carried Kennedy&#x27;s body back to Washington, D.C. It became the backup presidential aircraft after Nixon&#x27;s first term. It was temporarily removed from display on 5 December 2009, repainted and returned to display on President&#x27;s Day in 2010.

All presidential aircraft are now displayed in the Presidential Gallery, in the fourth building.

===Pioneers of flight===
A large section of the museum is dedicated to pioneers of flight, especially the Wright Brothers, who conducted some of their experiments at nearby Huffman Prairie. A replica of the Wrights&#x27; 1909 Military Flyer is on display, as well as other Wright brothers artifacts. The building also hosts the National Aviation Hall of Fame, which includes several educational exhibits.

===Uniforms and clothing===

The museum has many pieces of U.S. Army Air Forces and U.S. Air Force clothing and uniforms. At any time, more than 50 World War II-vintage A-2 leather flying jackets are on display, many of which belonged to famous figures in Air Force history. Others are painted to depict the airplanes and missions flown by their former owners. The displays include the jacket worn by Brigadier General James Stewart, P-38 ace Major Richard I. Bong&#x27;s sheepskin B-3 jacket and boots, an A-2 jacket worn by one of the few USAAF pilots to leave the ground during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s USAAF peacoat.
===Other exhibits and attractions===
The third building houses post-Cold War era planes such as the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber (test aircraft), the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth ground attack aircraft and others.

The fourth building has four galleries,Presidential, Research and Development, Space and Global Reach, housing more than 70 aircraft, missiles, and space vehicles. Also in the fourth building is an enlarged educational outreach area with three science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) Learning Nodes. Previously these collections were housed in an annex facility on Area B of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (the former Wright Field). Because the annex was physically located on the base itself, museum guests were required to go through additional security checks before taking museum buses to the hangar.

The museum owns other USAF aircraft, including former U.S. Army Air Service, USAAC or USAAF aircraft, that are on loan to other aerospace museums in the United States and overseas, as well as those on permanent static display at various U.S. Air Force installations and tenant activities worldwide, and at Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard installations across the United States. Most of these loaned aircraft duplicate aircraft exhibited by the museum. These other aircraft remain the property of the Department of the Air Force and are typically identified at these locations as being &quot;On Loan from the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force.&quot; The museum&#x27;s staff has very high standards for the restoration and quality of care of loaned assets and has, in the past, revoked these loans when it was deemed that these other museums did not have the resources to properly care for an artifact. This happened in the case of the famous Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;.

For an additional fee, guests can view aviation- and space-oriented films in a large format theater interspersed primarily with other documentaries. In 2013, the Air Force Museum Theater was upgraded from IMAX to digital 3D. The renovation included a new stage, theater seats, and a new theater screen to support a broader range of programming—including educational presentations, live broadcasts and expanded documentary choices. It also included a 7.1 surround-sound system, audio devices for the hearing or visually impaired, and personal closed captioning systems.

<text>Euarchontoglires (from: &quot;Euarchonta&quot; (&quot;true rulers&quot;) + &quot;Glires&quot; (&quot;dormice&quot;)), synonymous with Supraprimates, is a clade and a superorder of placental mammals, the living members of which belong to one of the five following groups: rodents, lagomorphs, treeshrews, primates, and colugos.

==Evolutionary affinities within mammals==

The Euarchontoglires clade is based on DNA sequence analyses and retrotransposon markers that combine the clades Glires (Rodentia + Lagomorpha) and Euarchonta (Scandentia + Primates + Dermoptera). It is usually discussed without a taxonomic rank but has been called a cohort, magnorder, or superorder. Relations among the four cohorts (Euarchontoglires, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria, Afrotheria) and the identity of the placental root remain controversial.

So far, few, if any, distinctive anatomical features have been recognized that support Euarchontoglires; nor does any strong evidence from anatomy support alternative hypotheses. Although both Euarchontoglires and diprotodont marsupials are documented to possess a vermiform appendix, this feature evolved as a result of convergent evolution.

Euarchontoglires probably split from the Boreoeutheria magnorder about 85 to 95 million years ago, during the Cretaceous, and developed in the Laurasian island group that would later become Europe. This hypothesis is supported by molecular evidence; so far, the earliest known fossils date to the early Paleocene. The combined clade of Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria is recognized as Boreoeutheria.

==Phylogenetic relationships within the clade==
The hypothesized relationship among the Euarchontoglires is as follows:

One study based on DNA analysis suggests that Scandentia and Primates are sister clades, but does not discuss the position of Dermoptera. Although it is known that Scandentia is one of the most basal Euarchontoglires clades, the exact phylogenetic position is not yet considered resolved, and it may be a sister of Glires, Primatomorpha or Dermoptera or to all other Euarchontoglires. Some old studies place Scandentia as sister of the Glires, invalidating Euarchonta.

Whole-genome duplication may have taken place in the ancestral Euarchontoglires.

<doc id="571468" wikidata="Q956426" url="?curid=571468" title="Dick James">
<text>Dick James (born Reginald Leon Isaac Vapnick; 12 December 1920 – 1 February 1986) was a British music publisher and singer. He and Brian Epstein established the Beatles&#x27; publisher Northern Songs. Later, with his son Stephen, James founded the DJM record label and recording studios, which signed Elton John and Bernie Taupin.

==Early life==

James was born on 12 December 1920 in the East End of London, to Polish Jewish immigrants. His father was a kosher butcher. 

He sang with North London dance bands in his early teens, and was a regular vocalist at the Cricklewood Palais by the age of seventeen. James joined the Henry Hall band, and made first radio broadcast in 1940, but joined the Army in 1942. After World War II he continued to sing with leading bands, including Geraldo&#x27;s. Later still, James was also a part-time member of The Stargazers, a popular early 1950s vocal group. In the 1950s he often appeared in the top ten &quot;Melody Maker&quot; vocal charts alongside the likes of Dickie Valentine and Frank Holder.

He was the singer of the theme songs of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;The Buccaneers&quot;, from British television in the 1950s, and was a friend and associate of the record producer George Martin.

==Switch to publishing==
James entered the music publishing business as his singing career tapered off. In 1958, he joined Sidney Bron Music as a song-plugger but decided to leave and open Dick James Music in 1961. In early 1963, he was contacted by Brian Epstein who was looking for a publisher for the second Beatles single, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. James called Philip Jones, producer of the TV show &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, played the record down the phone to him and secured the band&#x27;s first nationwide television appearance. The pair subsequently established Northern Songs Ltd., with Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney, to publish Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s original songs (fellow Beatles George Harrison and Ringo Starr were also signed to Northern Songs as songwriters, but did not renew their contracts in 1968). James&#x27;s company, Dick James Music, administered Northern Songs.

What initially began as an amicable working relationship between the Beatles and James disintegrated by the late 1960s: the Beatles considered that James had betrayed and taken advantage of them when he sold Northern Songs in 1969 without offering the band an opportunity to buy control of the publishing company. James profited handsomely from the sale of Northern Songs, but the Beatles never again had the rights to their own songs.

During the 1960s, James also handled Billy J. Kramer and Gerry and the Pacemakers. James lived in Anson Road, Cricklewood, north-west London, in the 1960s. He was involved, along with Brian Epstein, in offering Bobby Willis a singing contract which he turned down on his future wife, Cilla Black&#x27;s, insistence. Willis was a backing singer on Cilla Black&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot;.

==Later days==
James signed Elton John (then known as Reginald Dwight) and his lyricist Bernie Taupin as untried unknowns in 1967 after his son, Stephen, who had been working with his father since 1963, found Dwight using their recording studios late at night without permission. Stephen, who had started the recording studios and opened a record production company called This Productions, formed DJM Records in 1969. 

All of John&#x27;s releases up to 1976 were issued on the DJM record label. The label also carried Jasper Carrott, RAH Band, Danny Kirwan, and John Inman.

John formed his own Rocket label in 1973, but in 1982 he was involved in a court case with James about royalties. 

In June 1985, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that John was suing James over the rights to his earlier material – a case which John lost.

==Death==

James died in London of a heart attack on 1 February 1986, at the age of 65. Dick James Music was acquired by PolyGram which was, in turn, bought by Universal Music Group. The Dick James catalog is currently part of Universal Music Publishing Group.

<doc id="571469" wikidata="Q5251241" url="?curid=571469" title="Defence Regulation 18B">
<text>Defence Regulation 18B, often referred to as simply 18B, was one of the Defence Regulations used by the British Government during and before the Second World War. The complete name for the rule was Regulation 18B of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939. It allowed the internment without trial of people suspected of being actively opposed to the ongoing war with Germany during World War II such as separatist elements (for example Irish republicans suspected of involvement in the Sabotage Campaign) or were otherwise suspected of ideological Nazi-aligned sympathy (this included members of the British Union of Fascists and similar groups). The effect of 18B was to suspend the right of affected individuals to &quot;habeas corpus&quot;.

==Preparations for war==
The Defence Regulations existed in draft form, constantly revised, throughout the years between the world wars. In early 1939 it was decided that since a war might break out without warning or without time to pass an Act of Parliament to bring in emergency regulations, the Regulations should be split into two codes. Code A would be needed immediately if war broke out and could be passed in peacetime, while Code B, containing more severe restrictions on civil liberties, would be brought in later. In order not to alert the public to the existence of Code B, Code A was simply numbered consecutively. Defence Regulation 18 concerned restrictions on movement of aircraft. It was originally intended that Code B would be imposed by an Order in Council, with retrospective indemnity being granted by an Act of Parliament should anyone dispute the actions of the authorities.

On 24 August 1939, after tensions rose over Poland, the House of Commons was recalled from its summer recess to pass the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, which gave authority to implement the Defence Regulations. Code A was brought into effect that day and Code B followed on 1 September. Enemy aliens were detained using powers under the royal prerogative, while 18B was used mainly for British subjects.

==Text of the Regulation==


==18B in force==
The initial arrests were few and confined to those believed to be hard-core Nazis. By 14 September 1939 there were only 14 people interned under 18B. Several of these were German or Austrian by birth but had been naturalised as British subjects. The total would have been higher if William Joyce had not been tipped off by an MI5 officer, who appears to have been Maxwell Knight, about his impending internment, allowing him to flee to Germany.

In the Commons a group of Labour and Liberal MPs attempted to have Code B annulled on 31 October 1939, but were persuaded to withdraw their motion in favour of consultation that produced slightly amended wording.

==Expansion in May 1940==
The authorities dramatically revised their approach to the British far right in the late spring of 1940. The recent rapid seizure of power in Norway by Vidkun Quisling raised the possibility of a fifth column deposing the British government. The fall of the Low Countries and the invasion of France led to fear of invasion. Then on 20 May 1940 a raid on the home of Tyler Kent, a cypher clerk at the U.S. Embassy, revealed that Kent had stolen copies of thousands of telegrams, including those between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. Kent was an associate of Archibald Maule Ramsay, an openly antisemitic MP. This opened the possibility that Ramsay might use parliamentary privilege to reveal the telegrams, which Churchill had not told the Cabinet about. It would also reveal Roosevelt was trying to help Churchill while proclaiming his support for neutrality in public. The Cabinet decided in favour of widespread detentions of the far right on 22 May. This required an amended version of the Regulation, known as 18B (1A). 

One of the first to be arrested, in the early morning of 23 May, was Sir Oswald Mosley. Others arrested later included Admiral Sir Barry Domvile and Sir Reginald Goodall. Popular reaction was strongly in favour, and one reader wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; to note with satisfaction that news of Mosley&#x27;s arrest had been carried in the fifth column of the page. By December 1940 there were more than a thousand detainees in custody.

==Life for 18B detainees==
A person subject to 18B would be arrested without warning. Some were in the forces and were arrested while on parade. They would be taken first to police cells and then to prison. The first detainees were sent to HM Prison Wandsworth for men and HM Prison Holloway for women, but the men were later moved to HM Prison Brixton. With the expansion in numbers in 1940 came a shortage of prison accommodation, so some derelict wings of prisons (including Stafford and Liverpool women&#x27;s prison) were brought back into use to house internees.

Eventually it was decided to hold the internees in camps. The winter quarters of Bertram Mills&#x27;s circus provided one camp at Ascot Racecourse, and uncompleted council housing at Huyton near Liverpool was used from March 1941. Finally the authorities solved the accommodation problem, both for 18B internees and for interned enemy aliens by setting up camps on the Isle of Man. A new Act of Parliament, the Isle of Man (Detention) Act 1941, was needed to authorise the transfer. The men stayed at Peveril Camp, Peel, and the women at Rushen Camp, Port Erin. A small number of designated leaders remained in Wandsworth Prison throughout, for greater security. In a few cases husbands and wives who had both been interned were later allowed to live together.

The regime in the camps was relatively liberal. Free association was permitted and there were some entertainments, even including trips to cinemas.

==Legal process and challenging detention==
There were two justifications for an order to intern: &quot;acts prejudicial to the public safety&quot; and &quot;hostile origin or associations&quot;. A detainee could challenge their detention by way of an appeal to an Advisory Committee headed by Norman Birkett. The committee would be presented with a statement of the reasons why detention had been proposed, drawn up by MI5, which the detainee was not permitted to see. The committee could recommend continued detention, release under conditions or unconditional release. The committee&#x27;s recommendations went to the Home Secretary, who was not bound to accept them, and MI5 often lobbied him not to accept a recommendation to release.

Some detainees attempted to take further action through the courts. Challenges were brought on the basis of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, but refused on the grounds that the Home Secretary had taken his decision to intern on the basis of reports that had to be kept secret, and that he had reasonable cause to sign the internment orders. The most significant case was &quot;Liversidge v Anderson&quot;, brought by Robert W. Liversidge who was a successful Jewish businessman and therefore a highly atypical 18B internee. He brought a civil action for damages for false imprisonment, but did not apply for &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. It was ultimately decided that where it is required in law that a minister &quot;has reasonable cause to believe&quot; something before acting, a court can inquire into whether he really did believe it, but not into whether the things causing this belief were true. Lord Atkin wrote a dissent from this judgment.

Archibald Maule Ramsay, the only MP detained, had the matter referred to the House of Commons Committee on Privileges for a ruling as to whether the detention of an MP was a breach of the Privilege of Parliament. The committee decided that it was not.

==Abolition of 18B internments==
Fear of immediate invasion subsided after the Battle of Britain and the number of 18B internees slowly decreased as those of least concern were released. From a peak of about 1,000 in 1940, by summer 1943 there were fewer than 500. Oswald Mosley, who was said to be suffering from phlebitis, was released on 23 November 1943, to a great deal of public criticism. The Council for Civil Liberties demanded his continued imprisonment.

The invasion of France on D-Day again lifted pressure and by the end of 1944 only 65 internees under Regulation 18B remained, most of whom were naturalised German-born citizens. By the time Adolf Hitler killed himself there were 11 and by V-E Day there was only one. 18B ceased to have effect a few days later.

<text>The President of the Basque Government (, ), usually known in the Basque language as the Lehendakari (, ), is the head of government of the Basque Autonomous Community. The lehendakari leads the executive branch of the regional government.

The current lehendakari is Imanol Pradales, of the Basque Nationalist Party.

The Basque noun &quot;lehendakari&quot; means &quot;president&quot; and can refer to the president of any country, club, association etc.

==History of the term==

The term &quot;lehendakari&quot; is a 20th-century coinage, from the Basque &quot;lehendabizi&quot; (&quot;first&quot;) and the suffix -&quot;ari&quot; which indicates a profession. Before the establishment of Standard Basque in the 1970s, it was spelled &quot;Euzko Jaurlaritzaren Lendakari&quot;. Both &quot;lendakari&quot; (president) and &quot;jaurlaritza&quot; (government) are Basque neologisms created by members of the Basque Nationalist Party.

The generic Basque words for &quot;president&quot; and &quot;government&quot; are both &quot;lehendakari(a)&quot; and &quot;presidente(a)&quot; for the former, and &quot;gobernu(a)&quot; for the latter, being &quot;presidente(a)&quot; and &quot;gobernu(a)&quot; words loaned from Latin.

Since the very moment when the noun &quot;lehendakari&quot; was coined, both &quot;lehendakari(a)&quot; and &quot;presidente(a)&quot; have been used as perfect synonyms to refer to the head of any public or private government organ. So &quot;lehendakari&quot;, in Basque language, is not only the name of the president of the Basque autonomous community, but also the name officially used to refer to the head of the Chartered Community of Navarre, the head of a parliament, the head of a rugby club, the head of a hiring board, the head of a board of directors, etcetera.

On the other hand, the word &quot;lehendakari&quot; is commonly used in Spanish, both in and outside the Basque region, to refer exclusively to the Basque president, comparable to the use of Taoiseach as the title of the Irish head of government in English.

Lehendakaris elected for the PNV have sworn office following a ritual established by Aguirre: next to the Guernica Tree, on a Bible in Basque, using a symbolic formula which reads &quot;before God, prostrated, standing on Basque land, remembering the ancestors, under the Guernica Tree and before you, representatives of the Basque people, I swear thus, to fulfill the mandate granted to me as Lehendakari, and will thus be duly protecting and respective of the laws of this land&quot;.

Former lehendakari Patxi López used a similar formula in the same place, but also included visible changes to it by suppressing the &quot;before God, prostrated&quot; part and the fact that he sworn on a Basque Statute of Autonomy rather than on a Bible.

<doc id="571475" wikidata="Q1495661" url="?curid=571475" title="Gastrointestinal stromal tumor">
<text>Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs arise in the smooth muscle pacemaker interstitial cell of Cajal, or similar cells. They are defined as tumors whose behavior is driven by mutations in the KIT gene (85%), PDGFRA gene (10%), or BRAF kinase (rare). 95% of GISTs stain positively for KIT (CD117). Most (66%) occur in the stomach and gastric GISTs have a lower malignant potential than tumors found elsewhere in the GI tract.
==Classification==
GIST was introduced as a diagnostic term in 1983. Until the late 1990s, many non-epithelial tumors of the gastrointestinal tract were called &quot;gastrointestinal stromal tumors&quot;. Histopathologists were unable to specifically distinguish among types now known to be dissimilar molecularly. Subsequently, CD34, and later CD117, were identified as markers that could distinguish the various types. Additionally, in the absence of specific therapy, the diagnostic categorization had only a limited influence on prognosis and therapy.

The understanding of GIST biology changed significantly with identification of the molecular basis of GIST, particularly c-KIT. Historically, literature reviews prior to the molecular definition of GIST, and for a short time thereafter, asserted that 70-80% of GISTs were benign. The identification of a molecular basis for GIST led to the exclusion of many tumors that had been considered as GIST previously, and also the incorporation of a much larger number of tumors that had been labeled as other types of sarcomas and undifferentiated carcinomas. For example, some previous diagnoses of stomach and small bowel leiomyosarcomas (malignant tumor of smooth muscle) would be reclassified as GISTs on the basis of immunohistochemical staining. All GIST tumors are now considered to have malignant potential, and no GIST tumor can be definitively classified as &quot;benign&quot;. Hence, all GISTs are eligible for cancer staging in the AJCC (7th edition) / UICC. Nonetheless, different GISTs have different risk assessments of their tendency to recur or to metastasize, dependent on their site of origin, size, and number of mitotic figures.

A multi-omics study introduced a new molecular classification of GIST and identifies &quot;YLPM1&quot;, a potential tumor suppressor gene.  The study categorised &quot;KIT/PDGFRA&quot;-mutated GISTs into 4 molecular subtypes. The C2 subtype, enriched with CD8+ T cells, shows potential responsiveness to immunotherapy. The C3 subtype, with frequent &quot;CDKN2A&quot; aberrations, could benefit from a combination of &quot;KIT&quot; and &quot;CDK4/6&quot; inhibitors, showing strong synergistic effects. Additionally, C1 and C4 subtypes align with established risk classifications, supporting existing therapeutic strategies and prognostic outcomes.  This new molecular classification provides new insights that guide personalized treatments. 

Due to the change in definition, clinical pathways of care before the year 2000 are largely uninformative in the current era.

==Signs and symptoms==
GISTs may present with trouble swallowing, gastrointestinal bleeding, or metastases (mainly in the liver). Intestinal obstruction is rare, due to the tumor&#x27;s outward pattern of growth. Often, there is a history of vague abdominal pain or discomfort, and the tumor has become rather large by time the diagnosis is made.

== Pathophysiology ==
GISTs are tumors of connective tissue, i.e. sarcomas; unlike most gastrointestinal tumors, they are nonepithelial. About 70% occur in the stomach, 20% in the small intestine and less than 10% in the esophagus. Small tumors are generally not aggressive, especially when cell division rate is slow. GIST tumors commonly metastasize to the liver (in 28% of cases) and/or to the greater omentum, lesser omentum, or mesentery (in 30% of cases). Less common areas of metastasis include the lungs, subcutaneous tissue, lymph nodes or bones.

GISTs are thought to arise from interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), that are normally part of the autonomic nervous system of the intestine. They serve a pacemaker function in controlling motility.

===Genetics===
Most GISTs are sporadic. Less than 5% occur as part of hereditary familial or idiopathic multitumor syndromes. These include, in descending order of frequency, neurofibromatosis Recklinghausen (NF-1), Carney&#x27;s triad (gastric GIST, pulmonary chondroma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma), germline gain-of-function mutations in c-KIT/PDGFRA, and the Carney-Stratakis syndrome. The Carney-Stratakis syndrome is a dyad of hereditary GIST and paraganglioma, that is caused by germline mutations in the mitochondrial tumor suppressor gene pathway involving the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits SDHD, SDHC and SDHB.

=== c-KIT mutations ===
Approximately 85% GISTs are associated with an abnormal &quot;c-KIT&quot; pathway. &quot;c-KIT&quot; is a gene that encodes for a transmembrane receptor for a growth factor termed stem cell factor (&quot;scf&quot;). The abnormal &quot;c-KIT&quot; pathway most commonly (85%) arises from mutation of the gene itself; a smaller subset of c-KIT-associated GISTs are associated with constitutive activity of the &quot;KIT&quot; enzymatic pathway, found by immunoblotting. The c-KIT product/CD117 is expressed on ICCs and a large number of other cells, mainly bone marrow cells, mast cells, melanocytes and several others. In the gut, however, a mass staining positive for CD117 is likely to be a GIST, arising from ICC cells.

The c-KIT molecule comprises a long extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular part. Mutations generally occur in the DNA encoding the intracellular part (exon 11), which acts as a tyrosine kinase to activate other enzymes. Mutations make c-KIT function independent of activation by &quot;scf&quot;, leading to a high cell division rate and possibly genomic instability. Additional mutations are likely &quot;required&quot; for a cell with a &quot;c-KIT&quot; mutation to develop into a GIST, but the &quot;c-KIT&quot; mutation is probably the first step of this process.

Mutations in the exons 11, 9 and rarely 13 and 17 of the &quot;c-KIT&quot; gene are known to occur in GIST. The tyrosine kinase function of &quot;c-KIT&quot; is important in the medical therapy for GISTs, as described below. 
*KIT-D816V point mutations in &quot;c-KIT&quot; exon 17 are responsible for resistance to targeted therapy drugs like imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
*KIT-p.D419del (exon 8) — A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors previously regarded as wild-type tumors carries somatic activating mutations in KIT exon 8 (p.D419del).

=== PDGFRA mutations ===
Most GIST cells with wildtype (i.e. not mutated) &quot;c-KIT&quot; instead have a mutation in another gene, PDGFR-α (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha), which is a related tyrosine kinase. Mutations in &quot;c-KIT&quot; and &quot;PDGFrA&quot; are mutually exclusive .

=== Wild-type tumors ===
Lesser numbers of GISTs appear to be associated with neither c-KIT nor PDGFR-α abnormalities. About 10-15% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) carry wild-type sequences in all hot spots of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) (wt-GISTs). These tumors are currently defined by having no mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of the KIT gene and exons 12, 14, and 18 of the PDGFRA gene.

==Diagnosis==
CT scanning is often undertaken (see the &quot;radiology&quot; section).

Negative immunohistochemistry staining for β-catenin in cell nuclei is a consistent finding in uterine leiomyomas, and helps in distinguishing such tumors from β-catenin positive spindle cell tumors.

The definitive diagnosis is made with a biopsy, which can be obtained endoscopically, percutaneously with CT or ultrasound guidance or at the time of surgery. A biopsy sample will be investigated under the microscope by a pathologist physician. The pathologist examines the histopathology to identify the characteristics of GISTs (spindle cells in 70-80%, epitheloid aspect in 20-30%). Smaller tumors can usually be confined to the muscularis propria layer of the intestinal wall. Large ones grow, mainly outward, from the bowel wall until the point where they outstrip their blood supply and necrose (die) on the inside, forming a cavity that may eventually come to communicate with the bowel lumen.

When GIST is suspected—as opposed to other causes for similar tumors—the pathologist can use immunohistochemistry (specific antibodies that stain the molecule CD117 [also known as &quot;c-KIT&quot;] —see below). 95% of all GISTs are CD117-positive (other possible markers include CD34, Discovered On GIST-1 (DOG1), desmin, and vimentin). Other cells that show CD117 positivity are mast cells.

If the CD117 stain is negative and suspicion remains that the tumor is a GIST, the newer antibody DOG1 can be used. Also, sequencing of KIT and PDGFRA can be used to prove the diagnosis.

===Imaging===
The purpose of radiologic imaging is to locate the lesion, evaluate for signs of invasion and detect metastasis. Features of GIST vary depending on tumor size and organ of origin. The diameter can range from a few millimeters to more than 30 cm. Larger tumors usually cause symptoms in contrast to those found incidentally which tend to be smaller and have better prognosis. Large tumors tend to exhibit malignant behavior but small GISTs may also demonstrate clinically aggressive behavior.

Plain radiographs are not very helpful in the evaluation of GISTs. If an abnormality is seen, it will be an indirect sign due to the tumor mass effect on adjacent organs. On abdominal x-ray, stomach GISTs may appear as a radiopaque mass altering the shape of the gastric air shadow. Intestinal GISTs may displace loops of bowel and larger tumors may obstruct the bowel and films will show an obstructive pattern. If cavitations are present, plain radiographs will show collections of air within the tumor. Calcification is an unusual feature of GIST but if present can be visible on plain films.

Barium fluoroscopic examinations and CT are commonly used to evaluate the patient with abdominal complaints. Barium swallow images show abnormalities in 80% of GIST cases. However, some GISTs may be located entirely outside the lumen of the bowel and will not be appreciated with a barium swallow. Even in cases when the barium swallow is abnormal, an MRI or CT scan must follow since it is impossible to evaluate abdominal cavities and other abdominal organs with a barium swallow alone. In a CT scan, abnormalities may be seen in 87% of patients and it should be made with both oral and intravenous contrast. Among imaging studies, MRI has the best tissue contrast, which aids in the identification of masses within the GI tract (intramural masses). Intravenous contrast material is needed to evaluate lesion vascularity.

Preferred imaging modalities in the evaluation of GISTs are CT and MRI, and, in selected situations, endoscopic ultrasound. CT advantages include its ability to demonstrate evidence of nearby organ invasion, ascites, and metastases. The ability of an MRI to produce images in multiple planes is helpful in determining the bowel as the organ of origin (which is difficult when the tumor is very large), facilitating diagnosis.
==== Small GISTs ====
Since GISTs arise from the bowel layer called muscularis propria (which is deeper to the mucosa and submucosa from a luminal perspective), small GIST imaging usually suggest a submucosal process or a mass within the bowel wall. In barium swallow studies, these GISTs most commonly present with smooth borders forming right or obtuse angles with the nearby bowel wall, as seen with any other intramural mass. The mucosal surface is usually intact except for areas of ulceration, which are generally present in 50% of GISTs. Ulcerations fill with barium causing a bull&#x27;s eye or target lesion appearance. In contrast-enhanced CT, small GISTs are seen as smooth, sharply defined intramural masses with homogeneous attenuation.

==== Large GISTs ====
As the tumor grows it may project outside the bowel (exophytic growth) and/or inside the bowel (intraluminal growth), but they most commonly grow exophytically such that the bulk of the tumor projects into the abdominal cavity. If the tumor outstrips its blood supply, it can necrose internally, creating a central fluid-filled cavity with bleeding and cavitations that can eventually ulcerate and communicate into the lumen of the bowel. In that case, barium swallow may show an air, air-fluid levels or oral contrast media accumulation within these areas. Mucosal ulcerations may also be present. In contrast-enhanced CT images, large GISTs appear as heterogeneous masses due to areas of living tumor cells surrounding bleeding, necrosis or cysts, which is radiographically seen as a peripheral enhancement pattern with a low attenuation center. In MRI studies, the degree of necrosis and bleeding affects the signal intensity pattern. Areas of bleeding within the tumor will vary its signal intensity depending on how long ago the bleeding occurred. The solid portions of the tumor are typically low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, are high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and enhanced after administration of gadolinium. Signal-intensity voids are present if there is gas within areas of necrotic tumor.

==== Features of malignancy ====
Malignancy is characterized by local invasion and metastases, usually to the liver, omentum and peritoneum. However, cases of metastases to bone, pleura, lungs and retroperitoneum have been seen. In distinction to gastric adenocarcinoma or gastric/small bowel lymphoma, malignant lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is uncommon (&lt;10%) and thus imaging usually shows absence of lymph node enlargement. If metastases are not present, other radiologic features suggesting malignancy include: size (&gt;5 cm), heterogeneous enhancement after contrast administration, and ulcerations. Also, overtly malignant behavior (in distinction to malignant potential of lesser degree) is less commonly seen in gastric tumors, with a ratio of behaviorally benign to overtly malignant of 3-5:1. Even if radiographic malignant features are present, these findings may also represent other tumors and definitive diagnosis must be made immunochemically.

==Management==

For localized, resectable adult GISTs, if anatomically and physiologically feasible, surgery is the primary treatment of choice. Surgery can be potentially curative, but watchful waiting may be considered in small tumors in carefully selected situations. Post-surgical adjuvant treatment may be recommended. Lymph node metastases are rare, and routine lymph node removal is typically unnecessary. Laparoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive abdominal surgery using telescopes and specialized instruments, has been shown to be effective for removal of these tumors without needing large incisions. Resection of the tumor with a 1-cm margin is sufficient, and more radical resections add morbidity without benefit.
The clinical issues of exact surgical indications for tumor size are controversial. The decision of appropriate laparoscopic surgery is affected by tumor size, location, and growth pattern.
Radiotherapy has not historically been effective for GISTs and GISTs do not respond to most chemotherapy medications, with responses in less than 5%. However, several medications have been identified for clinical benefit in GIST: imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, ripretinib and avapritinib.

Imatinib (Glivec/Gleevec), an orally administered drug initially marketed for chronic myelogenous leukemia based on bcr-abl inhibition, also inhibits both &quot;c-KIT&quot; tyrosine kinase mutations and PDGFRA mutations other than D842V, and is useful in treating GISTs in several situations. Imatinib has been used in selected neoadjuvant settings. In the adjuvant treatment setting, the majority of GIST tumors are cured by surgery and do not need adjuvant therapy. An exception to this is where the anatomical position of the tumour means that surgery is technically difficult or complex. For example, rectal GIST often requires radical surgery to achieve complete resection, involving abdominoperineal resection and permanent stoma. In these situations, neoadjuvant imatinib can significantly decrease tumor size and mitotic activity and permit less radical sphincter-preserving surgery.

A substantial proportion of GIST tumors have a high risk of recurrence, as estimated by a number of validated risk stratification schemes, and can be considered for adjuvant therapy. The selection criteria underpinning the decision for the possible use of imatinib in these settings, including a risk assessment based on pathological factors such as tumor size, mitotic rate, and location, can be used to predict the risk of recurrence in GIST patients. Tumors &lt;2 cm with a mitotic rate of &lt;5/50 HPF have been shown to have a lower risk of recurrence than larger or more aggressive tumors. Following surgical resection of GISTs, adjuvant treatment with imatinib reduces the risk of disease recurrence in higher-risk groups. In selected higher-risk adjuvant situations, imatinib is recommended for 3 years.

Imatinib was approved for metastatic and unresectable GIST by the U.S. FDA on February 1, 2002. The two-year survival of patients with advanced disease has risen to 75–80% following imatinib treatment.

If resistance to imatinib is encountered, the multiple-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor sunitinib (marketed as Sutent) can be considered.

The effectiveness of imatinib and sunitinib depends on the genotype. c-KIT- and PDGFRA-mutation negative GIST tumors are usually resistant to treatment with imatinib, as is neurofibromatosis-1-associated wild-type GIST. A specific subtype of PDGFRA mutation, D842V, is also insensitive to imatinib. Recently, in PDGFRA-mutated GIST, avapritinib has been approved by FDA.
Now real-world data are coming for avapritinib as well

Regorafenib (Stivarga) was FDA-approved in 2013 for advanced GISTs that cannot be surgically removed and that no longer respond to imatinib (Gleevec) and sunitinib (Sutent).

==Epidemiology==
GISTs occur in 10-20 per one million people. The true incidence might be higher, as novel laboratory methods are much more sensitive in diagnosing GISTs. The estimated incidence of GIST in the United States is approximately 5000 cases annually. This makes GIST the most common form of sarcoma, which constitutes more than 70 types of cancer.

The majority of GISTs present at ages 50–70 years. Across most of the age spectrum, the incidence of GIST is similar in men and women.

Adult GISTs are rare before age 40. Pediatric GISTs are considered to be biologically distinct. Unlike GISTs at other ages, pediatric GISTs are more common in girls and young women. They appear to lack oncogenic activating tyrosine kinase mutations in both KIT and PDGFRA. Pediatric GISTs are treated differently from adult GISTs. Although the generally accepted definition of pediatric GIST is a tumor that is diagnosed at the age of 18 years or younger, &quot;pediatric-type&quot; GISTs can be seen in adults, which affects risk assessment, the role of lymph node resection, and choice of therapy.

<doc id="571478" wikidata="Q805960" url="?curid=571478" title="Bambi effect">
<text>The &quot;Bambi effect&quot; is an objection against the killing of animals that are perceived as &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;adorable&quot;, such as deer, while there may be little or no objection to the suffering of animals that are perceived as somehow repulsive or less than desirable, such as pigs or other woodland creatures.

Referring to a form of purported anthropomorphism, the term is inspired by Walt Disney&#x27;s 1942 animated film &quot;Bambi&quot;, where an emotional high point is the death of the lead character&#x27;s mother at the hands of the film&#x27;s antagonist, a hunter known only as &quot;Man&quot;.

==Effects==
Some commentators have credited this purported effect with increasing public awareness of the dangers of pollution, for instance in the case of the fate of sea otters after the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill, and in the public interest in scaring birds off airfields in non-lethal ways. In the case of invasive species, perceived cuteness may help thwart efforts to eradicate non-native intruders, such as the white fallow deer in Point Reyes, California. The effect is also cited as the anthropomorphic quality of modern cinema: most people in modern Western civilization are not familiar with wildlife, other than &quot;through TV or cinema, where fuzzy little critters discuss romance, self-determination and loyalty like pals over a cup of coffee&quot;, which has led to influences on public policy and the image of businesses cast in movies as polluting or otherwise harming the environment.

The effect was also cited in the events following a record snowfall in the U.S. state of Colorado in 2007, when food for mule deer, pronghorns, and elk became so scarce that they began to starve; the Colorado Department of Wildlife was inundated with requests and offers to help the animals from citizens, and ended up spending almost $2 million feeding the hungry wildlife. Among some butchers, the Bambi effect (and in general, Walt Disney&#x27;s anthropomorphic characters) is credited with fueling the vegetarian movement; chefs use the term to describe customers&#x27; lack of interest in, for instance, whole fish: &quot;It&#x27;s the Bambi effect – [customers] don&#x27;t want to see eyes looking at them&quot;.

The ’Bambi’ Effect has caused people to fight against organizations that manage wildlife. However, their intervention can often interfere with an ecosystem’s circle of life and thus their efforts become counterproductive. For example, this phenomenon can promote people to create organizations like The Smokey Bear Campaign. This Campaign decreased the number of fires but consequently led to an unexpected change in ecosystem. The ‘Bambi’ effect is backed up by a study (Wilks, 2008) which found that to help the more aggressive and unfriendly wildlife become more loved and see improvements in their environments there should be cuter and more innocent cartoons created and marketed for them.

<doc id="571480" wikidata="Q215313" url="?curid=571480" title="Absorbed dose">
<text>Absorbed dose is a dose quantity which is the measure of the energy deposited in matter by ionizing radiation per unit mass. Absorbed dose is used in the calculation of dose uptake in living tissue in both radiation protection (reduction of harmful effects), and radiology (potential beneficial effects, for example in cancer treatment). It is also used to directly compare the effect of radiation on inanimate matter such as in radiation hardening.

The SI unit of measure is the gray (Gy), which is defined as one joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of matter. The older, non-SI CGS unit rad, is sometimes also used, predominantly in the USA.

==Deterministic effects==
Conventionally, in radiation protection, unmodified absorbed dose is only used for indicating the immediate health effects due to high levels of acute dose. These are tissue effects, such as in acute radiation syndrome, which are also known as deterministic effects. These are effects which are certain to happen in a short time. The time between exposure and vomiting may be used as a heuristic for quantifying a dose when more precise means of testing are unavailable.

===Effects of acute radiation exposure===
==Radiation therapy==
===Dose computation===
The absorbed dose is equal to the radiation exposure (ions or C/kg) of the radiation beam multiplied by the ionization energy of the medium to be ionized.

For example, the ionization energy of dry air at 20 °C and 101.325 kPa of pressure is . (33.97 eV per ion pair) Therefore, an exposure of (1 roentgen) would deposit an absorbed dose of (0.00876 Gy or 0.876 rad) in dry air at those conditions.

When the absorbed dose is not uniform, or when it is only applied to a portion of a body or object, an absorbed dose representative of the entire item can be calculated by taking a mass-weighted average of the absorbed doses at each point.

More precisely,

formula_1

Where
*formula_2 is the mass-averaged absorbed dose of the entire item formula_3;
*formula_3 is the item of interest;
*formula_5 is the absorbed dose density (absorbed dose per unit volume) as a function of location;
*formula_6 is the density (mass per unit volume) as a function of location;
*formula_7 is volume.

==Stochastic risk - conversion to equivalent dose==


For stochastic radiation risk, defined as the &quot;probability&quot; of cancer induction and genetic effects occurring over a long time scale, consideration must be given to the type of radiation and the sensitivity of the irradiated tissues, which requires the use of modifying factors to produce a risk factor in sieverts. One sievert carries with it a 5.5% chance of eventually developing cancer based on the linear no-threshold model. This calculation starts with the absorbed dose.

To represent stochastic risk the dose quantities equivalent dose &quot;HT&quot; and effective dose &quot;E&quot; are used, and appropriate dose factors and coefficients are used to calculate these from the absorbed dose. Equivalent and effective dose quantities are expressed in units of the sievert or rem which implies that biological effects have been taken into account. The derivation of stochastic risk is in accordance with the recommendations of the International Committee on Radiation Protection (ICRP) and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU). The coherent system of radiological protection quantities developed by them is shown in the accompanying diagram.

For whole body radiation, with Gamma rays or X-rays the modifying factors are numerically equal to 1, which means that in that case the dose in grays equals the dose in sieverts.

==Development of the absorbed dose concept and the gray==

Wilhelm Röntgen first discovered X-rays on November 8, 1895, and their use spread very quickly for medical diagnostics, particularly broken bones and embedded foreign objects where they were a revolutionary improvement over previous techniques.

Due to the wide use of X-rays and the growing realisation of the dangers of ionizing radiation, measurement standards became necessary for radiation intensity and various countries developed their own, but using differing definitions and methods. Eventually, in order to promote international standardisation, the first International Congress of Radiology (ICR) meeting in London in 1925, proposed a separate body to consider units of measure. This was called the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, or ICRU, and came into being at the Second ICR in Stockholm in 1928, under the chairmanship of Manne Siegbahn.

One of the earliest techniques of measuring the intensity of X-rays was to measure their ionising effect in air by means of an air-filled ion chamber. At the first ICRU meeting it was proposed that one unit of X-ray dose should be defined as the quantity of X-rays that would produce one esu of charge in one cubic centimetre of dry air at 0 °C and 1 standard atmosphere of pressure. This unit of radiation exposure was named the roentgen in honour of Wilhelm Röntgen, who had died five years previously. At the 1937 meeting of the ICRU, this definition was extended to apply to gamma radiation. This approach, although a great step forward in standardisation, had the disadvantage of not being a direct measure of the absorption of radiation, and thereby the ionisation effect, in various types of matter including human tissue, and was a measurement only of the effect of the X-rays in a specific circumstance; the ionisation effect in dry air.

In 1940, Louis Harold Gray, who had been studying the effect of neutron damage on human tissue, together with William Valentine Mayneord and the radiobiologist John Read, published a paper in which a new unit of measure, dubbed the &quot;gram roentgen&quot; (symbol: gr) was proposed, and defined as &quot;that amount of neutron radiation which produces an increment in energy in unit volume of tissue equal to the increment of energy produced in unit volume of water by one roentgen of radiation&quot;. This unit was found to be equivalent to 88 ergs in air, and made the absorbed dose, as it subsequently became known, dependent on the interaction of the radiation with the irradiated material, not just an expression of radiation exposure or intensity, which the roentgen represented. In 1953 the ICRU recommended the rad, equal to 100 erg/g, as the new unit of measure of absorbed radiation. The rad was expressed in coherent cgs units.

In the late 1950s, the CGPM invited the ICRU to join other scientific bodies to work on the development of the International System of Units, or SI. It was decided to define the SI unit of absorbed radiation as energy deposited per unit mass which is how the rad had been defined, but in MKS units it would be J/kg. This was confirmed in 1975 by the 15th CGPM, and the unit was named the &quot;gray&quot; in honour of Louis Harold Gray, who had died in 1965. The gray was equal to 100 rad, the cgs unit.

==Other uses==
Absorbed dose is also used to manage the irradiation and measure the effects of ionising radiation on inanimate matter in a number of fields.

===Component survivability===
Absorbed dose is used to rate the survivability of devices such as electronic components in ionizing radiation environments.

===Radiation hardening===
The measurement of absorbed dose absorbed by inanimate matter is vital in the process of radiation hardening which improves the resistance of electronic devices to radiation effects.

===Food irradiation===

Absorbed dose is the physical dose quantity used to ensure irradiated food has received the correct dose to ensure effectiveness. Variable doses are used depending on the application and can be as high as 70 kGy.

==Radiation-related quantities==
The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units:
Although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the units curie, rad, and rem alongside SI units, the European Union European units of measurement directives required that their use for &quot;public health ... purposes&quot; be phased out by 31 December 1985.

<doc id="571489" wikidata="Q510991" url="?curid=571489" title="Alan Price">
<text>Alan Price (born 19 April 1942) is an English musician who first found prominence as the original keyboardist of the English rock band the Animals. He left the band in 1965 to form the Alan Price Set; his hit singles with and without the group include &quot;Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear&quot;, &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;, &quot;Rosetta&quot; (with Georgie Fame) and &quot;Jarrow Song&quot;. Price is also known for work in film and television, taking occasional acting roles and composing the soundtrack of Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 as a member of the Animals.

==Early life and career==
Price was born in Fatfield, Washington, County Durham. He was educated at Jarrow Grammar School, County Durham.

==Music==
===The Animals===

A self-taught musician, he was a founding member of the Tyneside group the Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo, which was later renamed the Animals. His organ playing on songs by the Animals, such as &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;, and &quot;Bring It On Home to Me&quot; was a key element in the group&#x27;s success.

As a member of the Animals, he appeared on numerous television shows including &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Price left the band in 1965 because of personal and musical differences, as well as his fear of flying while on tour.

In August 1967, he appeared with the Animals at the hippie love-in that was held in the grounds of Woburn Abbey.

Price participated in three reunions of the Animals between 1968 and 1984. In July 1983, the band started its last world tour. Price&#x27;s solo performance of &quot;O Lucky Man&quot; was included in its set. In 1984, the band broke up for the final time, and the album &quot;Greatest Hits Live (Rip It to Shreds)&quot; was released, composed of recordings from the band&#x27;s concert at Wembley Arena in London supporting the Police.

Price was inducted as a member of the Animals into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

===The Alan Price Set===
Price formed The Alan Price Set in 1965, with the line-up of Price, Clive Burrows (baritone saxophone), Steve Gregory (tenor saxophone), John Walters (trumpet), Peter Kirtley (guitar), Rod &quot;Boots&quot; Slade (bass) and &quot;Little&quot; Roy Mills (drums). In the same year, he appeared in the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; which featured Bob Dylan on tour in the UK.

===Solo===
During 1966, he enjoyed singles success with &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, which reached number 9 in the UK singles chart, and &quot;Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo&quot; which reached number 11 in the same chart. In 1967, the Randy Newman song &quot;Simon Smith and His Amazing Dancing Bear&quot; reached number four in the chart, as did his self-penned song, &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot; followed in 1968, and rose to number 13 in the UK singles charts.

Price went on to host shows such as the musical &quot;Price To Play&quot; in the late 1960s, which featured him performing and introducing the music of guests such as Fleetwood Mac and Jimi Hendrix. His second album, &quot;A Price on His Head&quot; (1967), featured seven songs by Randy Newman, who was virtually unknown at that time. Also in 1967, Price was no. 1 in the Keyboard Player category of the 1967 &quot;Beat Instrumental&quot; Gold Star Awards.

A later association with Georgie Fame resulted in &quot;Rosetta&quot;, which became a top-20 hit (1971), reaching number 11 in the UK Singles Chart. An album followed, &quot;Fame and Price, Price and Fame Together&quot;. During this period, Price and Fame secured a regular slot on &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; show produced by BBC Television, and also appeared on the &quot;Morecambe and Wise Show&quot;.

He recorded the autobiographical album &quot;Between Today and Yesterday&quot; (1974) from which the single &quot;Jarrow Song&quot; was taken, returning Price to the UK singles chart at number six. The minor single hits by Price &quot;Just For You&quot; and &quot;Baby of Mine&quot; from 1978 and 1979, respectively, as well as being issued on the usual black vinyl, were also released as red, heart-shaped vinyl discs, which reflected the craze for coloured and oddly shaped vinyl records at the time.

Price recorded two albums with the Electric Blues Company featuring guitarist and vocalist Bobby Tench and keyboardist Zoot Money, the first, &quot;Covers&quot;, was recorded in 1994. &quot;A Gigster&#x27;s Life for Me&quot; followed in 1996 and was recorded as part of Sanctuary&#x27;s &quot;Blues Masters Series&quot;, at Olympic Studios in south-west London.

Since 1996, Price has continued to perform regularly, arrange, write songs, and create other works. During the 2000s, he has continued to tour the UK with his own band and others, including the Manfreds, Maggie Bell and Bobby Tench.

&quot;Savaloy Dip&quot; was officially released in 2016. Due to an issuing error after the recording of this album in 1974 the album was re-called by the record company and not re-released at that time. The title track for his album &quot;Between Today and Yesterday&quot; was taken from the original Savaloy Dip recording.

==Film, stage and television==
Price appears in the D. A. Pennebaker documentary &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; (1965) and is in several scenes with Bob Dylan and his entourage, including one where his departure from the Animals is mentioned.

Price appeared with Georgie Fame in a series of TV shows scripted by Monty Python&#x27;s Terry Jones on BBC2 entitled &quot;The Price of Fame or Fame at any Price&quot;. They were broadcast on 17 September 1969, 20 November 1969 - 25 December 1969, 17 June 1970.

Price has been closely involved with the work of film director Lindsay Anderson. He wrote the music for Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973), which he performs on screen in the film and appears as himself in one part of the storyline. The score won the 1974 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.

Later, he wrote the score of Anderson&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Whales of August&quot; (1987).

He acted as the lead in &quot;Alfie Darling&quot; (1975), a sequel to the film &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), during the course of which he became romantically involved with his co-star, Jill Townsend. He also composed and sang the song &quot;Time and Tide (I Don&#x27;t Feel No Pain No More)&quot; for the animated film &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; (1982).

On April 23, 1977, Price appeared on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, hosted by Eric Idle. He sang the songs &quot;Poor People&quot; (from the &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; soundtrack) and &quot;In Times Like These.&quot; Also, in 1977, he appeared on another U.S. television show, &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert.&quot;

In 1979, Price composed and sang the theme song of the ATV series &quot;Turtle&#x27;s Progress&quot;. In 1981 he composed the score for the musical &quot;Andy Capp&quot; based on the eponymous comic strip. He also wrote the lyrics, together with the actor Trevor Peacock. The play transferred from the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, to London&#x27;s Aldwych Theatre in September 1982. Price later provided the theme to Thames Television&#x27;s 1988 sitcom adaptation of &quot;Andy Capp&quot; in the form of a rewritten &quot;Jarrow Song&quot;. Other TV theme work includes a re-recorded version of his 1974 single &quot;Papers&quot;, which was used as the theme tune to the London Weekend Television situation comedy &quot;Hot Metal&quot; and the song &quot;Changes&quot;, soundtrack to a popular TV commercial for the VW Golf.

In 1992, Anderson included an episode in his autobiographical BBC film &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot;, with a boat trip down the River Thames to scatter Rachel Roberts and Jill Bennett&#x27;s ashes on the waters, while Price accompanied himself and sang the song &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot;

In 2004, Price appeared in the Christmas edition of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; as Frankie Rio, the leader of a dubious band of musicians, the Franke Rio Trio, who are booked to appear in the Aidensfield Village Concert. The episode was entitled &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot;.

In 1992, he was living in London with his second wife Alison and two daughters.

Price is a Sunderland A.F.C. supporter, although Sunderland&#x27;s local rivals Newcastle United often used his version of &quot;Blaydon Races&quot; at matches. In 2011, he took part in the Sunderland A.F.C. charity Foundation of Light event.

<doc id="571490" wikidata="Q312238" url="?curid=571490" title="Cordyceps">
<text>Cordyceps is a genus of ascomycete fungi (sac fungi) that includes over 260 species worldwide, many of which are parasitic. Diverse variants of cordyceps have had more than 1,500 years of use in Chinese medicine. Most &quot;Cordyceps&quot; species are endoparasitoids, parasitic mainly on insects and other arthropods (they are thus entomopathogenic fungi); a few are parasitic on other fungi.

The generic name &quot;Cordyceps&quot; is derived from the ancient Greek κορδύλη &quot;kordýlē&quot;, meaning &quot;club&quot;, and the Latin &quot;-ceps&quot;, meaning &quot;-headed&quot;. The genus has a worldwide distribution, with most of the known species being from Asia.

== Taxonomy ==

There are two recognized subgenera:
*&quot;Cordyceps&quot; subgen. &quot;Cordyceps&quot; 
*&quot;Cordyceps&quot; subgen. &quot;Cordylia&quot; 

&quot;Cordyceps&quot; sensu stricto are the teleomorphs of several genera of anamorphic, entomopathogenic fungi such as &quot;Beauveria&quot; (&quot;Cordyceps bassiana&quot;), &quot;Septofusidium&quot;, and &quot;Lecanicillium&quot;.

=== Splits ===

&quot;Cordyceps&quot; subgen. &quot;Epichloe&quot; was at one time a subgenus, but is now regarded as a separate genus, &quot;Epichloë&quot;.

&quot;Cordyceps&quot; subgen. &quot;Ophiocordyceps&quot; was at one time a subgenus defined by morphology. Nuclear DNA sampling done in 2007 shows that members, including &quot;C. sinensis&quot; and &quot;C. unilateralis&quot;, as well as some others not placed in the subgenus, were distantly related to most of the remainder of species then placed in &quot;Cordyceps&quot; (e.g. the type species &quot;C. militaris&quot;). As a result, it became its own genus, absorbing new members.

The 2007 study also peeled off &quot;Metacordyceps&quot; (anamorph &quot;Metarhizium&quot;, &quot;Pochonia&quot;) and &quot;Elaphocordyceps&quot;. A number of species remain unclearly assigned and provisionally retained in &quot;Cordyceps&quot; sensu lato.

===Selected species===

There are over 260 species recognised in the genus &quot;Cordyceps&quot; including the following species:

*&quot;Cordyceps caespitosa&quot; 
*&quot;Cordyceps militaris&quot; 
*&quot;Cordyceps sinclairii&quot;
==Biology==
When &quot;Cordyceps&quot; attacks a host, the mycelium invades and eventually replaces the host tissue, while the elongated fruit body (ascocarp) may be cylindrical, branched, or of complex shape. The ascocarp bears many small, flask-shaped perithecia containing asci. These, in turn, contain thread-like ascospores, which usually break into fragments and are presumably infective.

== Research ==

Polysaccharide components and the nucleoside cordycepin isolated from &quot;C. militaris&quot; are under basic research, but more advanced clinical research has been limited and too low in quality to identify any therapeutic potential of cordyceps components.

== Uses ==
Along with &quot;Ophiocordyceps&quot;, &quot;Cordyceps&quot; has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine in the belief it can be used to treat diseases. There is no strong scientific evidence for such uses.

== Cultural representations ==

The video game series &quot;The Last of Us&quot; (2013–present) and its television adaptation present &quot;Cordyceps&quot; as a deadly threat to the human race, its parasitism powerful enough to result in global calamity. The result is a zombie apocalypse and the collapse of human civilization. &quot;Scientific American&quot; notes that some species in the genus &quot;are indeed body snatchers–they have been making real zombies for millions of years&quot;, though of ants or tarantulas, not of humans. &quot;The Last of Us&quot; proceeds from the premise that a new species of &quot;Cordyceps&quot; manages to jump between species of host, just as diseases like influenza have done. Its human hosts initially become violent &quot;infected&quot; beings, before turning into blind zombie &quot;clickers&quot;, complete with fungal &quot;fruiting bodies sprouting from their faces&quot;. In an additional detail that reflects &quot;Cordyceps&quot; biology, &quot;clickers&quot; then seek out a dark place in which to die and release the fungal spores, enabling the parasite to complete its life cycle. &quot;Scientific American&quot; comments that by combining a plausible mechanism with effective artistic design, the series gains &quot;both scientific rigor and beauty&quot;. 

In similar vein, &quot;Cordyceps&quot; causes a pandemic that wipes out most of humanity in Mike Carey&#x27;s 2014 postapocalyptic novel &quot;The Girl with All the Gifts&quot; and its 2016 film adaptation. In this case, an infected person becomes a &quot;hungry&quot;, a zombie thirsting for blood. In the fiction, Dr. Caldwell explains that the human-infecting fungus is a mutated form of &quot;Ophiocordyceps unilateralis&quot; (a group of species now split off from &quot;Cordyceps&quot;) which alters the behaviour of infected insects. The children of infected mothers, however, become &quot;hybrids&quot; with antibodies protecting them against the fungus.

<text>The Nokia 3410 is a mobile phone made by Nokia, the successor of the popular Nokia 3310. It was announced at CEBIT on 12 March 2002. The 3410 was one of the first Java phones by Nokia, as well as being one of the earliest mobile phones outside Japan to feature 3D graphics and an image editor. The Nokia 3410 was never released in the Asia-Pacific region, likely due to variants of the 3310 such as the Nokia 3315 (which featured almost the same design cues as the Nokia 3410) and 3350 which had similar hardware and keypad layout, as well as Nokia observing tetraphobia in Asian markets where the number four is viewed as unlucky.

== Hardware and software ==
The Nokia 3410 is compact, but somewhat heavy with a weight of 114 grams with the 825mAh removable Li-Ion battery. It has up and down buttons to assist with menu navigation and a stiff black button on the top of the phone serves as a switch to turn profiles on and off. Its display has a higher definition than its predecessor&#x27;s with 96×65 pixels (as opposed to 84×48 on the 3310). It also came packed with a WAP 1.1 browser, and basic utilities such as a calculator, alarm clock, stop watch, and countdown timer. It also can store up to 10 notes as reminders and has customizable and downloadable profiles. On the entertainment side it comes with five games (&quot;Snake II&quot;, &quot;Bumper&quot;, &quot;Space Impact&quot;, &quot;Bantumi&quot;, &quot;Link5&quot;) and a basic SMS messenger.

== 3D graphics ==
The Nokia 3410 was one of the first mobile phones released outside Japan to feature mobile 3D graphics. Despite the phone only featuring a monochrome screen and a 96×65 screen resolution, it includes many of the rendering features from the OpenGL ES 1.0 API, which did not launch till the following year. However, these 3D capabilities were only known to be used in three applications: a 3D text generator, 3D animated screensavers and a 3D game called &quot;Munkiki&#x27;s Castles&quot;. The 3D graphics were software rendered via the baseband processor (Texas Instruments MAD2WDI C GSM Baseband Processor). However, due to the low performance of the 12 MHz processor, the polygon count and rendering speed were very limited.

<text>Hitman is a stealth game franchise created by Danish developer IO Interactive. The player controls the contract killer Agent 47, who travels the world to assassinate various targets who are assigned to him.

The first game in the franchise, &quot;&quot;, was published by Eidos Interactive for Microsoft Windows in 2000 and introduced many of the gameplay elements that would become staples of the franchise. Eidos published the next three games, &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (2004), and &quot;&quot; (2006), for Windows and consoles, each building upon &quot;Codename 47&quot;″s foundation of stealth gameplay. After a six-year hiatus, &quot;&quot; (2012) was published, and a high-definition port of the original three console games in 2013, both by Square Enix.

After another hiatus from the main series, the next game titled &quot;Hitman&quot; (2016) was released, also published by Square Enix. &quot;Hitman 2&quot; (2018) was published by Warner Bros. Games, which later published HD ports of &quot;Hitman: Blood Money&quot; and &quot;Hitman: Absolution&quot; (2019). The most recent main series game, &quot;Hitman 3&quot; (2021), was self-published by IO Interactive. In 2023, IO rebranded &quot;Hitman 3&quot; as &quot;Hitman: World of Assassination&quot;, which imported all content of the previous two titles to the game. Feral Interactive published &quot;Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal&quot; for mobile platforms the same year.

Mainline games in the &quot;Hitman&quot; series have been generally well-received, with most critics praising the take on stealth gameplay and freedom of approach. Outside of the eight mainline releases, the franchise includes three spin-off games, two novels, remastered and HD rereleases of games, and a comic book miniseries, and two film adaptations: &quot;Hitman&quot; (2007) and &quot;&quot; (2015).

== Gameplay ==
Primarily from a third-person perspective and set in an open world environment, the core objective of &quot;Hitman&quot; is to kill an assigned target or targets. Certain levels will include auxiliary objectives, such as retrieving information or destroying a dangerous virus. The game allows the player different options to accomplish these tasks. Players can perform precise or indiscriminate assassinations; the games encourage players to implement a subtle approach to completing the levels, although this is not necessary.

== Development and history==

=== 1998–2000: Conception and first game ===

In 1998, following the dissolution of Danish game developer Zyrinx, its remaining team members regrouped to form Reto-Moto. This team later established IO Interactive (IO), which would go on to create its first intellectual property, the &quot;Hitman&quot; series. The inaugural game, &quot;Hitman: Codename 47&quot;, marked IO&#x27;s debut in the gaming industry. Initially, the studio had planned to develop a straightforward shooter titled &quot;Rex-Domonius&quot;, but the concept was ultimately abandoned by Reto-Moto.

The creative vision for &quot;Hitman: Codename 47&quot; was led by Danish designer Jacob Andersen, who drew inspiration from Hong Kong action films. Andersen explained, &quot;We decided to do a quick game inspired by Hong Kong action movies... Basically, a guy in a suit blasting away in a Chinese restaurant.&quot; This initial idea evolved into the story of Agent 47, a genetically engineered clone assassin. The game introduced a unique gameplay mechanic where players could assume disguises from non-player characters, a feature that became a hallmark of the series and set &quot;Hitman&quot; apart from other games of its time. Additionally, &quot;Codename 47&quot; was among the first games to incorporate ragdoll physics, which enhanced its realism and set a new standard for the industry.

Published by Eidos Interactive in 2000, &quot;Codename 47&quot; was initially released exclusively for Windows. Andersen noted that the decision to focus on PC development was driven by the difficulty of obtaining console development kits at the time, as well as the growing availability of 3D hardware for PCs, which made the platform particularly appealing for innovation.

=== 2001–2010: Sequels and first hiatus ===

The first sequel in the series, &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot;, was developed by IO Interactive and published by Eidos Interactive for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox in October 2002, followed by a GameCube release in June 2003. Building upon the foundation of &quot;Codename 47&quot;, &quot;Silent Assassin&quot; placed greater emphasis on stealth mechanics and introduced new features, such as a first-person view mode, the ability to incapacitate enemies non-lethally, and missions that allowed for multiple approaches. Reflecting on the development, Jacob Andersen noted, &quot;Now that the main platform was PS2, we felt more at home.&quot; However, some fans of the original game were dissatisfied with the introduction of a mid-level save system. While the controls were improved and efforts were made to address AI issues, non-player characters continued to exhibit unpredictable behavior. &quot;Many have tried to fix the AI since, and all have failed,&quot; Andersen remarked with a smile. &quot;It just has to have those odd moments—otherwise, it wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;Hitman&quot;.&quot;

The next installment, &quot;&quot;, was developed by IO and published by Eidos Interactive for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox in April 2004. The game served as both a sequel to &quot;Silent Assassin&quot; and a partial remake of &quot;Codename 47&quot;, featuring remastered levels from the first game with enhanced graphics, improved AI, and gameplay elements introduced in the second game. This decision was influenced by the fact that only 10% of &quot;Silent Assassin&quot; players had experienced &quot;Codename 47&quot;, largely due to the latter&#x27;s Windows exclusivity. As Andersen explained, &quot;We decided to make &quot;Hitman 2.5&quot; with some of the best content from [&quot;Codename 47&quot;].&quot;

&quot;Hitman: Blood Money&quot;, developed by IO and published by Eidos Interactive, was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360 in May 2006. Developed concurrently with its predecessor, &quot;Blood Money&quot; continued the story from the previous installment and represented a significant leap forward in terms of graphics, AI, and level design, thanks to increased resources from both IO and Eidos. The game received generally positive reviews and is widely regarded as a cult classic. &quot;Blood Money&quot; has been re-released multiple times: first as part of an HD collection alongside its two predecessors in 2013, again in 2019 as part of another HD collection with its successor, and most recently for mobile devices in 2023 and the Nintendo Switch in 2024.

A box set titled &quot;Hitman Trilogy&quot; (released as &quot;Hitman: The Triple Hit Pack&quot; in Europe) was published by Eidos for the PlayStation 2 on June 19, 2007, in North America and June 22, 2007, in Europe. The collection includes &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, with the games remaining identical to their original standalone releases.

Following the release of &quot;Blood Money&quot;, IO Interactive shifted its focus to developing new franchises, including the action-packed &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch&quot; series (2007 and 2010) and the more family-friendly &quot;Mini Ninjas&quot; (2009).

=== 2011–2015: &quot;Absolution&quot; and second hiatus ===

&quot;Hitman: Absolution&quot; was developed by IO Interactive and published by Square Enix, following their acquisition of Eidos Interactive in 2009. It was released worldwide on 20 November 2012 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The developers stated that &quot;Absolution&quot;, while retaining stealth elements, would move away from the sandbox levels of the first four games and incorporate more action-oriented features, such as a cinematic story-driven narrative and increased emphasis on gunplay, to appeal to a broader audience. A new mechanic called &#x27;Instinct&#x27; was introduced, allowing players to track enemies through walls and highlight objects of interest, a feature that would become a staple of the franchise.

Upon release, &quot;Absolution&quot; received mixed-to-positive reviews, with many longtime fans criticizing its departure from the classic &quot;Hitman&quot; formula. Despite selling over 4.5–5 million copies, the game failed to meet Square Enix&#x27;s sales expectations. On 15 May 2014, &quot;Hitman: Absolution — Elite Edition&quot; was released for OS X by Feral Interactive, featuring all previously released downloadable content, including &quot;Hitman: Sniper Challenge&quot;, a &quot;making of&quot; documentary, and a 72-page artbook.

In January 2013, Square Enix released HD remastered versions of &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot;, &quot;Hitman: Contracts&quot;, and &quot;Hitman: Blood Money&quot; for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 under the title &quot;Hitman HD Trilogy&quot;. The collection was released in North America on 29 January 2013, in Australia on 31 January 2013, and in Europe on 1 February 2013.

&quot;Hitman Go&quot;, a turn-based puzzle video game developed by Square Enix Montreal, was released for iOS on 17 April 2014 and for Android on 4 June 2014. A version for Microsoft Windows and Windows Phone was released on 27 April 2015. A &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; featuring improved visuals and additional content was released for PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam on 23 February 2016.

&quot;&quot;, a first-person shooter developed by Square Enix Montreal, was released for iOS and Android on 4 June 2015. Unlike traditional &quot;Hitman&quot; games, it focuses solely on sniping mechanics, with players taking on the role of Agent 47 to eliminate targets from a fixed position using a sniper rifle. The game lacks a narrative component and emphasizes precision and strategy.

=== 2015–present: &quot;World of Assassination&quot; trilogy, self-publication, and Freelancer ===

Following the underperformance of &quot;Absolution&quot;, IO Interactive reimagined the franchise, blending the gameplay elements introduced in &quot;Absolution&quot; with the open-ended design of earlier &quot;Hitman&quot; games. A soft reboot, simply titled &quot;Hitman&quot;, was announced at E3 2015 and published by Square Enix. The game&#x27;s first level launched in March 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, receiving highly positive reviews. Structured episodically, &quot;Hitman&quot; featured six levels released monthly throughout 2016, alongside additional content such as &quot;Elusive Targets&quot;, &quot;Escalations&quot;, and user-created &quot;Contracts&quot;. This episodic approach allowed IO to refine each level while creating a live game that expanded over time, laying the foundation for the series&#x27; future.

Despite critical acclaim, the game did not meet Square Enix&#x27;s financial expectations. In 2017, Square Enix parted ways with IO Interactive, allowing the studio to retain full control of the &quot;Hitman&quot; IP and become independent. IO abandoned the episodic format for its next title, &quot;Hitman 2&quot;, which was announced in June 2018 and published by Warner Bros. Games. Released in November 2018 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, the game featured six large sandbox levels, a multiplayer mode, and post-launch content. Players could also import levels from the 2016 game, retaining their progress if they already owned it.

In January 2019, Warner Bros. Games released the &quot;Hitman HD: Enhanced Collection&quot; for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, featuring updated ports of &quot;&quot; and &quot;Hitman: Absolution&quot; with improved graphics, 4K resolution, and modernized controls.

&quot;Hitman 3&quot; was revealed at the PlayStation 5 reveal event in 2020 and released in January 2021 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Stadia, and Nintendo Switch (as a cloud version). Developed and self-published by IO Interactive, the game allowed players to carry over progress from the previous two titles and introduced VR support, extending to imported levels from earlier games. &quot;Hitman 3&quot; was praised as the best entry in the series and became the most commercially successful &quot;Hitman&quot; game. IO supported it with extensive downloadable content and free updates, adding new features, game modes, and maps. In January 2023, IO merged &quot;Hitman&quot; and &quot;Hitman 2&quot; into &quot;Hitman 3&quot;, renaming it &quot;Hitman: World of Assassination&quot;.

A digital-only collection of the &quot;World of Assassination&quot; trilogy, released on 20 January 2022, included &quot;Hitman 3&quot; and access passes for content from &quot;Hitman&quot; and &quot;Hitman 2&quot;. A &quot;Premium Add-Ons&quot; bundle offered all DLC except for &quot;Hitman 3&quot;″s &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot; expansion. The collection was available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Steam, and Epic Games.

Under license from IO, &quot;Hitman Sniper: The Shadows&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Hitman: Sniper&quot;, was developed by Square Enix Montreal and released for iOS and Android on 3 March 2022. The game retained the sniping mechanics of its predecessor but did not feature Agent 47 as a playable character. This marked the final &quot;Hitman&quot; game published by Square Enix before it sold most of its assets to Embracer Group, and the game was discontinued by January 2023.

On 26 January 2023, IO Interactive launched the &quot;Freelancer&quot; mode for &quot;Hitman 3&quot;. This mode follows Agent 47&#x27;s life in a safehouse as he dismantles crime syndicates with Diana as his handler. Players choose targets and gear, balancing risk and reward, as failure results in losing equipment. The mode includes 100 mastery levels, unlocking new gear, outfits, and safehouse decorations.

===Future===
IO Interactive has confirmed that while &quot;Hitman 3&quot; concludes the &quot;World of Assassination&quot; trilogy, it will not be the final game in the franchise.

== Reception ==
The main games in the &quot;Hitman&quot; franchise have received generally positive reviews for their level design and gameplay elements. In particular the level of freedom offered to players and the unique approach to stealth gameplay. The series has received multiple awards and nominations, including several Game of the Year awards. It has been commercially successful, selling over 15 million copies worldwide as of 2015. The &quot;World of Assassination&quot; trilogy reached over 50 million players as of November 2021.

=== Original series===
&quot;Hitman: Codename 47&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Jim Preston reviewed the PC version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it three stars out of five, and calling it &quot;A deeply flawed masterpiece that will, nonetheless, reward forgiving gamers.&quot; &quot;Codename 47&quot; received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. In April 2009, Square Enix revealed that &quot;Codename 47&quot; had surpassed half a million sales globally. The game sold over 500,000 copies and received mixed reviews due to its controls and difficulty.

&quot;Silent Assassin&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it to be an improvement over its predecessor in every aspect. The game was also a commercial success, having sold more than 3.7 million copies as of 23 April 2009, which makes it the best-selling &quot;Hitman&quot; game in the original series.

&quot;Contracts&quot; was met with generally positive reviews; praise was directed at the improved gameplay elements, graphics, soundtrack, darker tone and atmosphere, while criticism was reserved for the lack of significant improvements and the familiarity with the previous two games. As of April 2009, the game has sold around 2 million copies.

&quot;Blood Money&quot; was a critical and commercial success, selling more than 2.1 million copies. It has gained a cult following and is considered by many publications and critics as one of the greatest video games ever made.

&quot;Absolution&quot; polarised reviewers and players. The game&#x27;s graphics, environments, locations, and varied gameplay options were widely praised. However, many critics and many long time fans of the series disliked the game for its linear structure, as opposed to the open ended nature of previous installments. As of March 2013, the game had sold over 3.6 million copies, failing to reach predicted sales targets.

=== &quot;World of Assassination&quot; trilogy ===
2016&#x27;s &quot;Hitman&quot; received positive reviews; critics praised the game&#x27;s episodic release format, locations, level design, and its replayability but criticized the always-online requirement and excessive handholding. The game under-performed commercially and caused publisher Square Enix to divest from IO Interactive in May 2017. Despite the slow start, IO Interactive announced the game had attracted seven million players as of November 2017 and more than 13 million players had played the game by May 2018. &quot;Hitman&quot; was nominated for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and Evolving Game at the 13th British Academy Games Awards. Video game publication Giant Bomb named &quot;Hitman&quot; their Game of the Year in 2016.

&quot;Hitman 2&quot; was met with generally positive reviews, with most critics considering it to be an improvement over its predecessor. It debuted at tenth place in the UK&#x27;s all-format sales charts. In Japan, the PlayStation 4 version sold 10,162 copies within its debut week, which made it the fifth best-selling retail game of the week in the country. The game was nominated for &quot;Control Design, 3D&quot; and &quot;Game, Franchise Adventure&quot; at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.

&quot;Hitman 3&quot; received generally favorable reviews, with most critics regarding it as the best entry in the &quot;World of Assassination&quot; trilogy, and some even calling it the best &quot;Hitman&quot; game to date. The game was nominated for multiple year-end awards, and won several of them, including &quot;PC Game of the Year&quot; at the 2021 Golden Joystick Awards. &quot;Hitman 3&quot; was also the most commercially successful of the franchise, selling 300% better than &quot;Hitman 2&quot; and making back its development costs in only a week.

===Collections===
&quot;Hitman Trilogy&quot; is a boxset that was released in 2007 for PlayStation 2. It includes &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot;, &quot;Hitman: Contracts&quot;, and &quot;Hitman: Blood Money&quot;. Just like the original releases of the games, the bundle was received positively.

&quot;Hitman HD Enhanced Collection&quot; was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It includes a port of &quot;Hitman: Blood Money&quot; and an HD remaster of &quot;Hitman: Absolution&quot;. Both games were released on 4K with 60fps, has texture and lighting improvements, and introduces updated controls for a &quot;...more fluid experience&quot;. It received a mixed-positive review as noted by &quot;PlayStation Country&quot;, who gave the score a 7/10: &quot;As a remaster, &quot;Hitman HD Enhanced Collection&quot; does deliver the best looking edition of these games to consoles. If either of these titles are missing from your &quot;Hitman&quot; collection, it&#x27;s worth a look&quot;.

=== Spin-offs ===

Following its announcement, &quot;Hitman Go&quot; was met with some skepticism from critics. However, the game received a positive reception with praise for the art, aesthetics, simple gameplay mechanics, and translation of &quot;Hitman&quot; to a mobile device. It received several nominations and awards from gaming publications and award organizations.

&quot;Hitman: Sniper&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews. Some reviewers praised the cleverness and minimalism of its puzzle design, but wanted more variety from its activity-dense scenarios.

==Other media==

=== Films ===
A film adaptation of the game series was released in 2007. The film, titled &quot;Hitman&quot;, is set in a separate continuity from the game series, directed by Xavier Gens and starring Timothy Olyphant as Agent 47. Executive producer Vin Diesel was originally cast to play Agent 47 but was replaced for unknown reasons. The film also stars Dougray Scott, Robert Knepper, Ulrich Thomsen and Michael Offei. In the film, the International Contract Agency is replaced by a similar group called the Organization, which, like the ICA, benefits from ties to various government agencies, is neutral in global matters and morality, and performs missions all over the world. Unlike the game wherein the hitmen are contracted from a range of backgrounds, the Organization instead recruits orphans and trains them from an early age.

A sequel was planned but Olyphant stated on the Nerdist podcast that he had no interest in returning for a sequel and only did the original film in order to pay for his new house following the sudden cancellation of &quot;Deadwood&quot;.

On 5 February 2013, it was reported that the film series was being rebooted with the title &quot;&quot;, directed by Aleksander Bach. Screenwriter of the original film, Skip Woods, wrote the screenplay with Mike Finch and starring Rupert Friend as 47 after Paul Walker, who was originally 
cast, was killed in a car crash on 30 November 2013. The film also stars Zachary Quinto, Hannah Ware, Thomas Kretschmann, Dan Bakkedahl and Ciarán Hinds.

In 2015, &quot;Hitman&quot; film producer Adrian Askarieh stated that he hoped to oversee a film universe with &quot;Just Cause&quot;, &quot;Hitman&quot;, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, and &quot;Thief&quot;, but admitted that he does not have the rights to &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. In May 2017, the Game Central reporters at Metro UK suggested that the shared universe was unlikely, pointing out that no progress had been made on any &quot;Just Cause&quot;, &quot;Deus Ex&quot; nor &quot;Thief&quot; films.

===Television series===

In November 2017, Hulu and Fox 21 Television Studios announced it would produce a television series based on the game. Derek Kolstad, Adrian Askarieh and Chuck Gordon would serve as its executive producers. The pilot episode would be written by Kolstad. Kolstad has stated that his adaption of Agent 47 will differ slightly from that of the vision IO has already made. Despite being announced in 2017, he does not know when the TV series will start filming.

===Literature===

William C. Dietz wrote the first novel in the &quot;Hitman&quot; book series, titled &quot;Hitman: Enemy Within&quot;. It was released on August 28, 2007, and published by Del Rey Books. Set between the events of &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the novel centers around Puissance Treize, an organisation rival to ICA.

The second novel in the &quot;Hitman&quot; book series, &quot;Hitman: Damnation&quot;, was written by Raymond Benson and was published on October 30, 2012. It serves as a tie-in and prequel to &quot;&quot;.

IO Interactive partnered with Dynamite Entertainment to create &quot;Agent 47: Birth of the Hitman&quot;, a six-issue comic book miniseries that ran from November 2017 to June 2018, and was later released as a graphic novel in 2019. The series ties-in with the &quot;World of Assassination&quot; trilogy and depicts 47&#x27;s life before the events of the games, including his upbringing at Dr. Ort-Meyer&#x27;s asylum and his previous career as a brainwashed assassin for Providence alongside his best friend, Lucas Grey / Subject 6. IO Interactive had complete control over the storyline of the comic.

* Ada (played by Vicki Lewis) – George&#x27;s secretary at the New York Yankees. In the episode &quot;The Secretary&quot;, George does not want to hire an attractive secretary so he could focus on his work, and in the interview process turned down a few women because they were so attractive.

In &quot;The Race&quot;, Ada overhears George on the phone with a woman he met through &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, and believes George is a communist. She tells Steinbrenner about this but instead of reprimanding him, Steinbrenner sends George to Cuba to recruit Cuban baseball players.

Kramer once likened the cute baby to Lyndon Johnson while Elaine compared the ugly one to a Pekingese. Carol is notable for her nasal voice and her memorable quote: &quot;You gotta see the baby!&quot; or &quot;You gotta have a baby!&quot; in &quot;The Soul Mate&quot;.

The same actor also appears briefly in &quot;The Wizard&quot; as the hot dog vendor talking with George.

Kruger&#x27;s company &quot;botched the Statue of Liberty&quot; job as they &quot;couldn&#x27;t get the green stuff off&quot; and is infamous for losing money (when viewing the company financial reports Kruger nonchalantly exclaimed, &quot;wow, we really took it on the chin last year&quot;).

That causes Kramer to crash George&#x27;s car when he and Jerry see her walking down the street. In &quot;The Betrayal&quot;, Sue Ellen invites Elaine to India for her wedding. Elaine and Sue Ellen briefly reconcile before it is revealed that Elaine once had a relationship with Sue Ellen&#x27;s groom. She also appears in &quot;The Bottle Deposit, Part 1&quot; and &quot;The Abstinence&quot;.
* The Doctor (Siegel/Wexler) (played by Victor Raider-Wexler): The doctor who performed the surgery in &quot;The Junior Mint&quot;, he was also the doctor who broke the news of Susan&#x27;s death in &quot;The Invitations&quot; and who diagnosed George&#x27;s atrophied condition in &quot;The Summer of George&quot;. Also testified in &quot;The Finale&quot; about George&#x27;s reaction to the news of Susan&#x27;s death, which he described as &quot;restrained jubilation&quot; which caused Susan&#x27;s parents to be angry with him.
* The Soup Nazi (played by Larry Thomas): Based on a real person (Al Yeganeh), the Soup Nazi is a soup chef who often denied customers his delicious soup for the slightest misbehavior with the admonition, &quot;NO soup for you!&quot; The character&#x27;s name, revealed in &quot;The Finale&quot;, is Yev Kassem.
* Tia Van Camp (played by Jennifer Campbell): Blonde supermodel whom Jerry is seated next to on an airplane flight back to New York (&quot;The Airport&quot;). Jerry gets a date with Tia. Tia eventually dumps Jerry in &quot;The Pick&quot; when she notices him in his car, appearing to pick his nose.
* Tina Robbins: (played by Siobhan Fallon Hogan): A &quot;waitress/actress&quot; (although she considers herself an &quot;actress/waitress&quot;) who is Elaine&#x27;s roommate in her original apartment, later moving out and sub-letting it to her. She is introduced in &quot;The Deal&quot; and dates Kramer in &quot;The Truth&quot;, much to the dismay of Elaine, who complains about the loud tribal music and sexual noises in her apartment. Elaine describes her acting as &quot;Ethel Merman, but without the talent&quot;. She makes a brief appearance in &quot;The Opposite&quot;, kicking Elaine out of her apartment for, among other things, buzzing up a jewel thief and using Canadian quarters in the washing machine.
* Vanessa (played by Lynn Clark): An attractive woman whom Jerry meets at a birthday party in &quot;The Stake Out&quot; (Season 1, Episode 2). They date once in &quot;The Stock Tip&quot; (Season 1, Episode 5).
* Walter: (played by Wayne Wilderson): Co-worker of Elaine at J. Peterman. He appears in four episodes: &quot;The Summer of George&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Apology&quot; and &quot;The Frogger&quot;. In &quot;The Bookstore&quot;
* Wyck Thayer (played by Bruce Davison): Chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation, who assumes that George actually killed Susan. Appeared in the first two episodes of the eighth season, as well as &quot;The Van Buren Boys&quot; later in the same season. George consistently calls Wyck &quot;Wink&quot;.

===Unseen characters===
*Bob Sacamano – One of Kramer&#x27;s best friends, who is often referred to as the source of nutty ideas or inaccurate information. Writer Larry Charles created the character after his real-life friend of the same name. He is from New Jersey. In &quot;The Heart Attack&quot;, Kramer explains how Bob had a botched hernia operation, so that now he has a high-pitched voice and spends his days in a wheelchair. He also had rabies at some point. Bob worked, for a time, in a condom factory and provided a bag of defective condoms to Kramer in &quot;The Fix-Up&quot;, which George then used with Elaine&#x27;s friend, briefly thinking he had impregnated her as a result. Bob once stayed at Kramer&#x27;s apartment as a guest for a year and a half. Bob also befriended Jerry when Jerry and Kramer switch apartments; Jerry adds that Bob sells Russian hats in Battery Park for $40: the hats are made from nutria, a type of rat, instead of sable. In the ninth season episode &quot;The Wizard&quot;, Kramer states that Bob Sacamano&#x27;s father (Bob Sacamano Sr.) lives in Florida; he&#x27;s the source of faulty electronic organizers known as &quot;Willards&quot; (instead of the more expensive &quot;Wizards&quot;) that foil Kramer&#x27;s run for condo board president. Although Sacamano himself is never seen, Sacamano Sr. appears in a deleted scene.
* Cousin Jeffrey – Jerry&#x27;s horse-faced cousin, about whom Uncle Leo always raves. He worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Jeffrey once got Jerry tickets to a Paul Simon concert, and George, sans eyeglasses, once claimed to see Jeffrey kissing Jerry&#x27;s girlfriend in the street (it turned out to be a policewoman patting a horse). According to Uncle Leo, Jeffrey&#x27;s favorite animal is the leopard because he likes the spots, and he keeps in close contact with his college botany professor, a friendship which Leo thinks is rare. Jeffrey received a citation from the city for his edible foliage tour through Central Park. The back of Cousin Jeffrey&#x27;s head can be seen in the deleted scenes for &quot;The Glasses&quot; episode on the season DVD.
*Lomez – An unseen friend of Kramer&#x27;s. He is an Orthodox Jew, &quot;old school&quot;, according to Kramer in &quot;The Fatigues&quot;. In &quot;The Betrayal&quot;, Kramer bangs on the door of a portable toilet yelling &quot;Come on Lomez, we&#x27;re going to miss the movie!&quot; When Kramer starts the Peterman Reality Bus Tour in &quot;The Muffin Tops&quot;, he notes Lomez&#x27;s place of worship on the tour. Kramer purchases a hot tub from Lomez and speaks on the phone to him while taking a shower in &quot;The Apology&quot;. In &quot;The Package&quot;, Kramer tells Jerry that he traded his stereo to Lomez for some steaks. In &quot;The Voice&quot;, Kramer&#x27;s intern Darren tells Jerry and George that &quot;Mr. Kramer&#x27;s in a meeting with Mr. Lomez&quot;. And in &quot;The Van Buren Boys&quot;, one of the Susan Ross Scholarship interviewees is credited, although not mentioned, as Lomez Junior. His relation, if any, to Lomez remains unknown as his only line is &quot;You like that, don&#x27;t you?&quot; when George mentions that he has a 4.0 GPA. In &quot;The Slicer&quot;, Kramer tells Elaine that Lomez blew his neighbor&#x27;s circuit to stop an incessant alarm, prompting her to do the same. Later in the same episode, Kramer tells Elaine that, in blowing his neighbor&#x27;s circuit, Lomez caused the automatic cat feeder to stop functioning, resulting in incessant meowing from the neighbor&#x27;s cat. When Elaine asks Kramer what Lomez did about it, he replies that &quot;He moved to a motel and the cat eventually died.&quot;

===Imaginary characters and pseudonyms===
* Art Vandelay – George&#x27;s imaginary alter-ego, which is referenced in many episodes. In &quot;The Finale&quot;, the name of the judge is coincidentally Arthur Vandelay.
* Kel Varnsen – An alias used by Jerry in &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;, in order to help George with his Vandelay Industries. He also uses this alias in &quot;The Puerto Rican Day&quot;.
* H. E. Pennypacker – Kramer appears as H. E. Pennypacker, &quot;a wealthy industrialist&quot;. In order to help Elaine get revenge on Putumayo in &quot;The Millennium&quot;, Kramer (as &quot;Pennypacker&quot;) attempts to use his pricing gun to greatly reduce the prices of the store&#x27;s clothing. When Kramer inadvertently crushes the pricing gun, he removes the desiccants from some of the clothes (which will make clothes noticeably musty in five years), and tells Gladys Mayo, &quot;I think I&#x27;m going to build a roller coaster instead.&quot; He also uses the alias in &quot;The Puerto Rican Day&quot; where he poses as a buyer interested in an apartment in order to use its bathroom.
* Martin van Nostrand or Peter von Nostrand – As Dr. Martin von Nostrand, Kramer tried to get Elaine&#x27;s medical chart in &quot;The Package&quot;. He also used the von Nostrand alias in &quot;The Slicer&quot;, posing as a Juilliard-trained dermatologist, and is recognized as Dr. von Nostrand in &quot;The Strike&quot;. Kramer used the name Martin von Nostrand (without the &quot;doctor&quot; prefix) while auditioning for the role of himself on the show &quot;Jerry&quot; in &quot;The Pilot, Part 1&quot;. Kramer posed as Professor Peter von Nostrand in &quot;The Nose Job&quot; in order to retrieve a jacket from another man&#x27;s apartment.
