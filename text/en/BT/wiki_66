<text>Joseph Dudley (September 23, 1647 – April 2, 1720) was a colonial administrator, a native of Roxbury in Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the son of one of its founders. He had a leading role in the administration of the Dominion of New England (1686–1689), which was overthrown in the 1689 Boston revolt. He served briefly on the council of the Province of New York, from which he oversaw the trial which convicted Jacob Leisler, the ringleader of Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion. He then spent eight years in England in the 1690s as Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight, including one year as a Member of Parliament for Newtown (Isle of Wight). In 1702, he returned to New England after being appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and Province of New Hampshire, posts that he held until 1715.

His rule of Massachusetts was characterized by hostility and tension, with political enemies opposing his attempts to gain a regular salary and regularly making complaints about his official and private actions. Most of his tenure was dominated by the French and Indian Wars, in which the two provinces were on the front lines with New France and suffered from a series of major and minor French and Indian raids. He orchestrated an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Acadian capital of Port Royal in 1707, raised provincial militia forces for its successful capture in 1710, and directed an unsuccessful expedition against Quebec in 1711.

Dudley&#x27;s governorship initiated a hostility in Massachusetts toward royal governance, most frequently over the issue of the salaries of crown officials. The colonial legislature routinely challenged or disputed the prerogatives of the governor, and this hostility affected most of the governors of Massachusetts up to the American Revolutionary War and the end of British rule. Dudley&#x27;s rule of New Hampshire, however, was comparatively uncontroversial.

==Early life==
Joseph Dudley was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts Bay Colony, on September 23, 1647. His mother was Katherine Dudley (née Dighton or Deighton; formerly Hackburne) and his father was Thomas Dudley, one of the founders and leading magistrates of the colony. His father was 70 when he was born and died in 1653. His mother then married Reverend John Allin, who raised the young Dudley at his home in Dedham, Massachusetts.

He graduated from Harvard College in 1665 and was admitted as a freeman in 1672. He became a member of the Massachusetts General Court representing Roxbury in 1673, and he was elected to the colony&#x27;s council of assistants in 1676. King Philip&#x27;s War broke out in 1675, and Dudley was a commissioner who accompanied the colonial militia into the field against the Indians. He was present at the Great Swamp Fight in which the Narragansett tribe was decisively defeated. In 1679, Dudley was recorded as owning an enslaved Native American girl. Dudley served for several years as a commissioner to the New England Confederation, and was sent by the administration on diplomatic missions to neighboring Indian communities. He served on a committee that negotiated the boundary between Massachusetts and the Plymouth Colony.

==Revocation of the colonial charter==
The colony&#x27;s governance came under the scrutiny of King Charles II in the 1660s, and it faced a substantial threat in the late 1670s. Crown agent Edward Randolph was sent to New England in 1676 to collect customs duties and to enforce the Navigation Acts, and in the process he documented a list of issues and took his complaints to the Lords of Trade in London. The colonial leadership was divided on how to answer this threat. Dudley was part of a moderate faction which supported accommodating the king&#x27;s demands, along with his brother-in-law Simon Bradstreet and William Stoughton, and they were opposed by others who did not want the crown to interfere in the colony&#x27;s business. These factions were separated in part along class lines; the wealthier land owners and merchants who dominated the legislature&#x27;s upper house (called the &quot;court of assistants&quot;) favored accommodation, while the more representative lower house favored the opposition view.

In 1682, Massachusetts sent Dudley and John Richards to London as agents to represent its case to the Lords of Trade. Dudley brought a letter of introduction from Plymouth Governor Thomas Hinckley to colonial secretary William Blathwayt, and the favorable relationship that he established with Blathwayt contributed to his future success as a colonial administrator, but it also raised suspicions in the colony about his motives and ability to represent the colony&#x27;s interests. The authority of the agents was limited, and the Lords of Trade insisted to the colonial administration that their agents be authorized to negotiate modifications to the colonial charter. The legislature refused this demand, which led to a &quot;quo warranto&quot; writ demanding the surrender of the colonial charter. Dudley brought this news to Boston at the end of 1683, igniting a heated debate in the legislature, with the opposition party again prevailing. The leadership of the opposition included Reverend Increase Mather, and they began to view the accommodationists as enemies of the colony, including Dudley and Bradstreet. Richards sided with the opposition, and Dudley was removed from the council of assistants in the 1684 election.

The episode also led to accusations that Dudley had secretly schemed in London to have the charter vacated as a means of personal advancement. He did discuss the form of a replacement government with Edward Randolph, although this discussion did not take place until after the &quot;quo warranto&quot; writ was issued. The opposition viewed this as evidence that he was hostile to the present order of the colony and was working against his commission as colonial agent. Randolph, in contrast, believed that Dudley&#x27;s election loss meant that he would make a good crown servant. As a result, rumors began circulating in Boston in late 1684 that Dudley might be appointed governor, with Randolph as his deputy.

The charter was annulled in 1684, and the Lords of Trade began planning to combine the New England colonies into a single province called the Dominion of New England. This work was still in progress when King James II took the throne in 1685. However, there were difficulties in drafting a commission for intended governor Sir Edmund Andros, and this prompted Randolph to propose an interim appointment. Dudley was chosen for this post based on Randolph&#x27;s recommendation, and a commission was issued to him on October 8, 1685, as President of the Council of New England. The territories covered by his commission included the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Province of New Hampshire, the Province of Maine, and the &quot;Narragansett Country&quot;, a territory at the heart of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (which both Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut Colony were trying to wrest away from Rhode Island). Randolph was appointed to a long list of subsidiary posts, including secretary of the colony, which gave him considerable power.

==President of the Council of New England==
Randolph arrived in Boston with Dudley&#x27;s charter on May 14, 1686, and Dudley formally took charge of Massachusetts on May 25, but his rule did not begin auspiciously. A number of Massachusetts magistrates had been named to his council but they refused to serve, and he was unable to reconcile with Increase Mather, who refused to see him. According to Randolph, the Puritan magistrates &quot;were of opinion that God would never suffer me to land again in this country, and thereupon began in a most arbitrary manner to assert their power higher than at any time before.&quot; Elections of colonial military officers were compromised when many of them also refused to serve. Dudley made a number of judicial appointments, generally favoring the political moderates who had supported accommodation of the king&#x27;s wishes in the battle over the old charter. He renewed treaties with the Indians of northern New England, and traveled to the Narragansett Country in June to formally establish his authority there.

Dudley was significantly hampered by the inability to raise revenues in the dominion. His commission did not give him authority to introduce new revenue laws, and the Massachusetts government had repealed all such laws in 1683 in anticipation of losing their charter. Furthermore, many people refused to pay the remaining taxes on the grounds that they had been enacted by the old government and were thus invalid. Dudley and Randolph also attempted to introduce the Church of England into New England, but they were largely unsuccessful; they did not have buildings to house their new churches, and they recognized the danger of forcing Colonial churches to share their buildings with the Church of England.
Dudley and Randolph enforced the Navigation Acts, although they did not adhere to the letter of the law, understanding that some provisions of the acts were unfair, such as requiring payments of multiple duties. Some violations were overlooked, and they suggested to the Lords of Trade that the laws be modified to ameliorate these conditions. Nevertheless, the Massachusetts economy was harmed by their otherwise vigorous enforcement of the acts.

Dudley and Randolph eventually had a falling out over matters related to trade, administration, and religion. &quot;I am treated by Mr. Dudley worse than by Mr. Danforth&quot;, Randolph wrote, comparing Dudley to one of the opposition magistrates.

While Dudley governed, the Lords of Trade decided to include the colonies of Rhode Island and Connecticut in the dominion, based on a petition from Dudley&#x27;s council. Andros&#x27; commission had been issued in June, and he was given an annex to the commission with instructions to bring Rhode Island and Connecticut under his authority.

==Service under Governor Andros==
Governor Andros arrived in December 1686 and immediately assumed the reins of power. Dudley sat on his council and served as judge of the superior court and censor of the press. He also sat on the committee that worked to harmonize legislation throughout the dominion. Andros&#x27; appointed council was intended to represent all of the combined territories. However, travel was difficult, and the government did not reimburse travel expenses; consequently, his council was dominated by representatives from Boston and Plymouth.

Dudley and Randolph were widely regarded as a significant part of the tyranny of Andros&#x27; reign. Dudley&#x27;s position as judge brought him the harshest criticisms and complaints, in particular when he enforced unpopular laws imposed by Andros concerning taxes, town meetings, and land titles. During this period, Dudley acquired ownership over a slave named Peter.

Word arrived in April 1689 of the 1688 Glorious Revolution, whereupon citizens rose up and arrested Andros. Dudley was away from the city but was arrested upon his return. Since he was ill, he was released into house arrest upon payment of a £1,000 bond, but a group descended on his home and carried him back to jail. He stayed in jail for ten months, in part for his own safety, and was then sent back to England at the command of King William, along with Andros and other dominion leaders. Colonial authorities brought charges against Andros and Dudley, but none of their agents in London were prepared to take responsibility for making those charges in court, so they were dismissed and both men were freed.

Dudley was stranded in London with limited connections, so he appealed to Blathwayt for assistance. He also asked business associate Daniel Coxe for help in finding a new position. Coxe was a proprietor of West Jersey and he considered Dudley for the post of lieutenant governor there, and Dudley was eventually recommended as chief of council to New York governor Henry Sloughter which he took up in 1691. In addition to his council duties, he negotiated with New York&#x27;s Indians and sat as chief judge in the trial of Jacob Leisler, who had led the rebellion in 1689 that overthrew Andros&#x27; lieutenant governor Francis Nicholson. The trial was controversial, and Dudley&#x27;s role made him many enemies. Leisler was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death. Governor Sloughter was initially opposed to immediately executing Leisler and his main ally and son-in-law Jacob Milborne, preferring to defer the decision to the king. But he changed his mind under pressure from anti-Leisler forces in his council, and the two men were executed on 16 May 1691. Cotton Mather claimed that Dudley was an influential force arguing for Leisler&#x27;s execution, although this is disputed by testimony from anti-Leisler councillor Nicholas Bayard.

Dudley left New York for his home in Roxbury in 1692 and re-established connections with political friends such as William Stoughton, who had just been appointed lieutenant governor of the newly chartered Province of Massachusetts Bay under Sir William Phips.

==Patronage==
Dudley returned to England in 1693 and embarked on a series of intrigues to regain an office in New England. He ingratiated himself to the religious elements of the London political establishment by formally joining the Church of England. He acquired a patron in Baron Cutts, who engineered his appointment as lieutenant governor of the Isle of Wight where Cutts had been appointed governor. Dudley and Cutts assisted each other politically; Cutts worked to advance Dudley&#x27;s agenda in London, while Dudley worked to promote that of Cutts on Wight. Dudley manipulated the parliamentary election processes on the island to ensure that Cutts&#x27; chosen candidates were elected, which made Cutts highly unpopular on Wight—although he continued as its governor until his death in 1707. Dudley also tried to assist Cutts with some financial difficulties, and he schemed with Cutts&#x27; father-in-law to gain permission to mint coins for use in New England.

Dudley also tried to assist Cutts with some financial difficulties, and he schemed with Cutts&#x27; father-in-law to gain permission to mint coins for use in New England.

Dudley&#x27;s principal object of intrigue was the removal of William Phips as Massachusetts governor, something that he did not hide from the colony&#x27;s agents. Phips&#x27; rule was unpopular in Massachusetts, and he was recalled to England to answer a variety of charges brought by his opponents. Dudley caused Phips to be arrested shortly after his arrival, on the charge that Phips had withheld customs money from the crown. Phips died in February 1695 before the charges were heard, and Dudley was optimistic that he would be named the next governor.

At this point, Dudley&#x27;s enemies from New York and Massachusetts joined forces to deny him the opportunity. Jacob Leisler&#x27;s son was in London attempting to have the attainder reversed against his father&#x27;s estate. A bill was introduced into Parliament to accomplish this, with assistance from Massachusetts agent Constantine Phips. The debate included a review of Leisler&#x27;s trial, and Dudley was forced to appear and defend his role in it. Afterward, Phips wrote to Cotton Mather that Dudley &quot;is not so much talked of to be governor&quot;, and the appointment went instead to Lord Bellomont.

Cutts continued to be active on Dudley&#x27;s behalf, and he secured him election as a Member of Parliament representing Newtown in 1701. This made it possible for Dudley to further expand his own political connections in London. He managed temporarily to mend political fences with Constantine Phips and Cotton Mather, and he began lobbying for the Massachusetts governorship after the death of Bellomont in 1701. In this he was successful, receiving commissions as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire on 1 April 1702 from Queen Anne.

==Governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire==
Dudley served as governor until 1715, and his administration was marked by regular conflict with the general court, particularly in the early years. His instruction from the English colonial office was to gain a regular salary for the governor. He and all of the succeeding royal governors, however, were unsuccessful in extracting this concession from the Colonial legislature, and it became a regular source of friction between representatives of crown and colony. Dudley pressed his complaint in letters to London, in which he complained of men &quot;who love not the Crown and Government of England to any manner of obedience&quot;. He wrote in one letter to his son Paul, then the provincial attorney general, &quot;this country will never be worth living in for lawyers and gentlemen, till the charter is taken away.&quot; This letter was discovered and published, fueling Colonial opposition to his rule. Dudley also angered the powerful Mather family when he awarded the presidency of Harvard to John Leverett instead of Cotton Mather. He consistently vetoed the election of councilors and speakers of the general court who had acted against him in 1689, further increasing his unpopularity in Massachusetts. In contrast, his tenure as Governor of New Hampshire was popular; its legislature specifically praised him to the Queen after learning of complaints levelled against him by his Massachusetts opponents.

===Queen Anne&#x27;s War===

Dudley was active in managing colonial defenses during Queen Anne&#x27;s War. He attempted to forestall French-orchestrated Indian hostilities by meeting with Indians at Casco Bay in June 1703, but the French had already begun rallying them to their cause and the war began with raids on the settlements of southern Maine in August 1703. Dudley called out the militia and licensed privateers to raid French shipping, such as Thomas Larimore; he also fortified the Massachusetts and New Hampshire frontiers from the Connecticut River to southern Maine. The French and Indians raided Deerfield in February 1704, prompting calls for retaliation, and Dudley authorized aging Indian fighter Benjamin Church to lead an expedition against settlements in Acadia. He also engaged in protracted negotiations for the return of captives taken at Deerfield.

Boston merchants and the Mathers accused Dudley of being in league with smugglers and others who were illegally trading with the French, in part because he specifically refused permission for Church to attack the Acadian capital and commercial center of Port Royal. He sought to forestall these criticisms in 1707 when he sent the colonial militia on a fruitless expedition against Port Royal. In 1708, a bitter attack on his administration was published in London entitled &quot;The Deplorable State of New England by reason of a Covetous and Treacherous Governor and Pusillanimous Counsellors&quot;, as part of a campaign to have him recalled. Dudley again rallied the provincial militias for a planned expedition against Quebec in 1709, but the supporting expedition from England was called off. Support arrived from England in 1710, and a successful siege led to the fall of Port Royal and the beginning of the Province of Nova Scotia.

Boston was again the organizing point for the 1711 Quebec Expedition combining British and provincial forces. The expedition failed disastrously, however, when some of its transports foundered on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River. During the war, Dudley also authorized expeditions against the Abenakis of northern New England, but these were largely ineffective. The war quieted to some extent after the fall of Port Royal, with only small raiding parties hitting frontier communities, and peace came in 1713 with the Treaty of Utrecht.

Dudley negotiated a separate peace with the Abenakis at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1713. He hoped to separate the western Kennebec tribe from French influence and consequently adopted a fairly hard line, threatening to withhold trade that was vital to their survival and reiterating claims of British sovereignty over them. The Treaty of Portsmouth (1713) resulted from those negotiations and repeated the claims of sovereignty. Dudley claimed that the French had ceded Abenaki lands as part of Acadia, and one sachem responded: &quot;The French never said anything to us about it, and we wonder how they would give it away without asking us&quot;. Nevertheless, Dudley and succeeding governors treated the Abenaki as British subjects, and friction persisted over British colonial expansion into Maine which flared into Dummer&#x27;s War in the 1720s.

===Other issues===

The war worsened currency and finance problems in Massachusetts. The province had been issuing paper currency since the 1690s, and the issue of large amounts of this currency was causing it to depreciate compared to precious metals used in other currencies. The situation caused a division between the colonists and the governor which was not repaired until the 1760s. Business leaders who borrowed money were happy to pay it back later with depreciated currency, while lenders sought reforms to stabilize the currency. In 1714, Dudley&#x27;s opponents proposed that a bank should issue as much as £50,000 in currency, secured by the shareholder&#x27;s real estate properties. Dudley was opposed to this scheme, and instead convinced the provincial legislature to issue £50,000 in bills of credit. The financially powerful interests whom he upset with this move proved to be his downfall.

In 1713, surveys determined that the border between Massachusetts and the Connecticut Colony had been incorrectly sited in the 17th century, and that Massachusetts had consequently distributed lands that actually belonged to Connecticut. Dudley and Connecticut Governor Gurdon Saltonstall negotiated an agreement in which Massachusetts would retain those lands but would grant to Connecticut an equivalent amount of land. The Equivalent Lands amounted to over on either side of the Connecticut River in northern Massachusetts, southeastern Vermont, and southwestern New Hampshire. These lands were auctioned off in April 1716, and Connecticut used the proceeds to fund Yale College.

Dudley&#x27;s commission expired in 1714, six months after the death of Queen Anne, as did that of Lieutenant Governor William Tailer. The governor&#x27;s council was dominated by his political opponents, and they asserted its authority at that point. They assumed control of the government on February 14, 1715, under the provisions of the provincial charter concerning governance in the absence of the governor and his lieutenant. Just six weeks later, news arrived from England that Dudley&#x27;s commission had been temporarily confirmed by King George I, and he was reinstated on March 21.

However, Dudley&#x27;s political opponents were active in London, especially those involved in the land bank proposal, and they convinced the king to appoint Colonel Elizeus Burges as governor later in the year. Burges&#x27; commission was proclaimed in Boston on November 9, 1715, ending Dudley&#x27;s commission. Burges was not in the colony, so governance fell to Lieutenant Governor Tailer whose commission had been renewed. Jonathan Belcher and Jeremiah Dummer, the brother of Dudley&#x27;s son-in-law William Dummer, bribed Burges to resign his commission without leaving England in April 1716, and a new commission was issued to Samuel Shute, who promised to oppose attempts to introduce the land bank. He arrived in the colony and assumed the post of governor in October 1716, with William Dummer as his lieutenant.

Dudley retired to the family home in Roxbury. He acted as an informal advisor to Governor Shute upon his arrival, and made appearances at public and private functions. He died in Roxbury on April 2, 1720, and was buried next to his father in Roxbury&#x27;s Eliot Burying Ground, accompanied with the pomp and ceremony appropriate to his position.

==Family and legacy==
In 1668, Dudley married Rebecca Tyng, who survived him by two years. They had 12 children, 10 of whom survived to adulthood. His son Paul served as attorney general and chief justice of Massachusetts, and Dudley, Massachusetts is named for his sons Paul and William, who were its first proprietors. His daughter Katherine Dudley married Lt. Governor William Dummer; another daughter Ann Dudley married John Winthrop (1681–1747), son of Wait Winthrop, grandson of John Winthrop the Younger and great-grandson of John Winthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. John Winthrop and Ann Dudley were parents of Catherine [Winthrop] wife of Colonel Epes Sargent the parents of Paul Dudley Sargent (1745-1828).

Dudley owned large tracts of land in Massachusetts when he died, principally in Roxbury and Worcester County. The Worcester properties he purchased from the Nipmuc in partnership with William Stoughton, and he was granted land in Oxford, Massachusetts for the purpose of settling French Huguenots. He frequently used his position to ensure that his land titles were judicially cleared, especially when president of the dominion and governor of the province. This was a practice that also benefited friends, relatives, and business partners. Edward Randolph wrote that it was &quot;impossible to bring titles of land to trial before them where his Majesties&#x27;s rights are concerned, the Judges also being parties.&quot; From 1713 to 1722, Dudley was recorded as owning a slave named Brill.

Historian John Palfrey wrote that Dudley &quot;united rich intellectual attributes with a groveling soul&quot;, forging political connections and relationships in his early years for the purpose of his own advancement. He capitalized on his favorable family connections to the Puritan leadership of Massachusetts to establish connections in England, but then betrayed those Massachusetts connections when it became necessary to further his quest for power. Thomas Hutchinson also served as provincial governor and wrote an extensive history of Massachusetts; he wrote that Dudley &quot;had as many virtues as can consist with so great a thirst for honour and power.&quot; Biographer Everett Kimball adds that Dudley &quot;possessed a good deal of tact and personal charm, by which, when everything else failed, he could sometimes transform an enemy into a friend.&quot;

<text>Decision tree learning is a supervised learning approach used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. In this formalism, a classification or regression decision tree is used as a predictive model to draw conclusions about a set of observations.

Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called [[Statistical classification|classification]] [[decision tree|trees]]; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called [[regression analysis|regression]] [[decision tree|trees]]. More generally, the concept of regression tree can be extended to any kind of object equipped with pairwise dissimilarities such as categorical sequences.

Decision trees are among the most popular machine learning algorithms given their intelligibility and simplicity.

In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data (but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making).

==General==

Decision tree learning is a method commonly used in data mining. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on several input variables.

A decision tree is a simple representation for classifying examples. For this section, assume that all of the input features have finite discrete domains, and there is a single target feature called the &quot;classification&quot;. Each element of the domain of the classification is called a &quot;class&quot;.
A decision tree or a classification tree is a tree in which each internal (non-leaf) node is labeled with an input feature. The arcs coming from a node labeled with an input feature are labeled with each of the possible values of the target feature or the arc leads to a subordinate decision node on a different input feature. Each leaf of the tree is labeled with a class or a probability distribution over the classes, signifying that the data set has been classified by the tree into either a specific class, or into a particular probability distribution (which, if the decision tree is well-constructed, is skewed towards certain subsets of classes).

A tree is built by splitting the source set, constituting the root node of the tree, into subsets—which constitute the successor children. The splitting is based on a set of splitting rules based on classification features. This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning.
The recursion is completed when the subset at a node has all the same values of the target variable, or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions. This process of &quot;top-down induction of decision trees&quot; (TDIDT) is an example of a greedy algorithm, and it is by far the most common strategy for learning decision trees from data.

In data mining, decision trees can be described also as the combination of mathematical and computational techniques to aid the description, categorization and generalization of a given set of data.

Data comes in records of the form:

:formula_1

The dependent variable, formula_2, is the target variable that we are trying to understand, classify or generalize. The vector formula_3 is composed of the features, formula_4 etc., that are used for that task.

==Decision tree types==
Decision trees used in data mining are of two main types:
* Classification tree analysis is when the predicted outcome is the class (discrete) to which the data belongs.
* Regression tree analysis is when the predicted outcome can be considered a real number (e.g. the price of a house, or a patient&#x27;s length of stay in a hospital).

The term classification and regression tree (CART) analysis is an umbrella term used to refer to either of the above procedures, first introduced by Breiman et al. in 1984. Trees used for regression and trees used for classification have some similarities – but also some differences, such as the procedure used to determine where to split.

Some techniques, often called &quot;ensemble&quot; methods, construct more than one decision tree:
* Boosted trees Incrementally building an ensemble by training each new instance to emphasize the training instances previously mis-modeled. A typical example is AdaBoost. These can be used for regression-type and classification-type problems.
* Committees of decision trees (also called k-DT), an early method that used randomized decision tree algorithms to generate multiple different trees from the training data, and then combine them using majority voting to generate output.
* Bootstrap aggregated (or bagged) decision trees, an early ensemble method, builds multiple decision trees by repeatedly resampling training data with replacement, and voting the trees for a consensus prediction.
** A random forest classifier is a specific type of bootstrap aggregating
* Rotation forest – in which every decision tree is trained by first applying principal component analysis (PCA) on a random subset of the input features.

A special case of a decision tree is a decision list, which is a one-sided decision tree, so that every internal node has exactly 1 leaf node and exactly 1 internal node as a child (except for the bottommost node, whose only child is a single leaf node). While less expressive, decision lists are arguably easier to understand than general decision trees due to their added sparsity, permit non-greedy learning methods and monotonic constraints to be imposed.

Notable decision tree algorithms include:
* ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)
* C4.5 (successor of ID3)
* CART (Classification And Regression Tree)
* OC1 (Oblique classifier 1). First method that created multivariate splits at each node.
* Chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID). Performs multi-level splits when computing classification trees.
* MARS: extends decision trees to handle numerical data better.
* Conditional Inference Trees. Statistics-based approach that uses non-parametric tests as splitting criteria, corrected for multiple testing to avoid overfitting. This approach results in unbiased predictor selection and does not require pruning.

ID3 and CART were invented independently at around the same time (between 1970 and 1980), yet follow a similar approach for learning a decision tree from training tuples.

It has also been proposed to leverage concepts of fuzzy set theory for the definition of a special version of decision tree, known as Fuzzy Decision Tree (FDT).
In this type of fuzzy classification, generally, an input vector formula_3 is associated with multiple classes, each with a different confidence value.
Boosted ensembles of FDTs have been recently investigated as well, and they have shown performances comparable to those of other very efficient fuzzy classifiers.

==Metrics==
Algorithms for constructing decision trees usually work top-down, by choosing a variable at each step that best splits the set of items. Different algorithms use different metrics for measuring &quot;best&quot;. These generally measure the homogeneity of the target variable within the subsets. Some examples are given below. These metrics are applied to each candidate subset, and the resulting values are combined (e.g., averaged) to provide a measure of the quality of the split. Depending on the underlying metric, the performance of various heuristic algorithms for decision tree learning may vary significantly.

=== Estimate of Positive Correctness ===
A simple and effective metric can be used to identify the degree to which true positives outweigh false positives (see Confusion matrix). This metric, &quot;Estimate of Positive Correctness&quot; is defined below:

formula_6

In this equation, the total false positives (FP) are subtracted from the total true positives (TP). The resulting number gives an estimate on how many positive examples the feature could correctly identify within the data, with higher numbers meaning that the feature could correctly classify more positive samples. Below is an example of how to use the metric when the full confusion matrix of a certain feature is given:

Feature A Confusion Matrix

Here we can see that the TP value would be 8 and the FP value would be 2 (the underlined numbers in the table). When we plug these numbers in the equation we are able to calculate the estimate: formula_7. This means that using the estimate on this feature would have it receive a score of 6.

However, it should be worth noting that this number is only an estimate. For example, if two features both had a FP value of 2 while one of the features had a higher TP value, that feature would be ranked higher than the other because the resulting estimate when using the equation would give a higher value. This could lead to some inaccuracies when using the metric if some features have more positive samples than others. To combat this, one could use a more powerful metric known as Sensitivity that takes into account the proportions of the values from the confusion matrix to give the actual true positive rate (TPR). The difference between these metrics is shown in the example below:

In this example, Feature A had an estimate of 6 and a TPR of approximately 0.73 while Feature B had an estimate of 4 and a TPR of 0.75. This shows that although the positive estimate for some feature may be higher, the more accurate TPR value for that feature may be lower when compared to other features that have a lower positive estimate. Depending on the situation and knowledge of the data and decision trees, one may opt to use the positive estimate for a quick and easy solution to their problem. On the other hand, a more experienced user would most likely prefer to use the TPR value to rank the features because it takes into account the proportions of the data and all the samples that should have been classified as positive.

===Gini impurity===
Gini impurity, Gini&#x27;s diversity index, or Gini-Simpson Index in biodiversity research, is named after Italian mathematician Corrado Gini and used by the CART (classification and regression tree) algorithm for classification trees. Gini impurity measures how often a randomly chosen element of a set would be incorrectly labeled if it were labeled randomly and independently according to the distribution of labels in the set. It reaches its minimum (zero) when all cases in the node fall into a single target category.

For a set of items with formula_8 classes and relative frequencies formula_9, formula_10, the probability of choosing an item with label formula_11 is formula_9, and the probability of miscategorizing that item is formula_13. The Gini impurity is computed by summing pairwise products of these probabilities for each class label:

:formula_14

The Gini impurity is also an information theoretic measure and corresponds to Tsallis Entropy with deformation coefficient formula_15, which in physics is associated with the lack of information in out-of-equilibrium, non-extensive, dissipative and quantum systems. For the limit formula_16 one recovers the usual Boltzmann-Gibbs or Shannon entropy. In this sense, the Gini impurity is nothing but a variation of the usual entropy measure for decision trees.

===Information gain===

Used by the ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 tree-generation algorithms. Information gain is based on the concept of entropy and information content from information theory.

Entropy is defined as below

:formula_17
where formula_18 are fractions that add up to 1 and represent the percentage of each class present in the child node that results from a split in the tree.

:formula_19formula_20

Averaging over the possible values of formula_21,

:formula_22formula_23
:Where weighted sum of entropies is given by,
:formula_24

That is, the expected information gain is the mutual information, meaning that on average, the reduction in the entropy of &quot;T&quot; is the mutual information.

Information gain is used to decide which feature to split on at each step in building the tree. Simplicity is best, so we want to keep our tree small. To do so, at each step we should choose the split that results in the most consistent child nodes. A commonly used measure of consistency is called information which is measured in bits. For each node of the tree, the information value &quot;represents the expected amount of information that would be needed to specify whether a new instance should be classified yes or no, given that the example reached that node&quot;.

Consider an example data set with four attributes: &quot;outlook&quot; (sunny, overcast, rainy), &quot;temperature&quot; (hot, mild, cool), &quot;humidity&quot; (high, normal), and &quot;windy&quot; (true, false), with a binary (yes or no) target variable, &quot;play&quot;, and 14 data points. To construct a decision tree on this data, we need to compare the information gain of each of four trees, each split on one of the four features. The split with the highest information gain will be taken as the first split and the process will continue until all children nodes each have consistent data, or until the information gain is 0.

To find the information gain of the split using &quot;windy&quot;, we must first calculate the information in the data before the split. The original data contained nine yes&#x27;s and five no&#x27;s.

:formula_25

The split using the feature &quot;windy&quot; results in two children nodes, one for a &quot;windy&quot; value of true and one for a &quot;windy&quot; value of false. In this data set, there are six data points with a true &quot;windy&quot; value, three of which have a &quot;play&quot; (where &quot;play&quot; is the target variable) value of yes and three with a &quot;play&quot; value of no. The eight remaining data points with a &quot;windy&quot; value of false contain two no&#x27;s and six yes&#x27;s. The information of the &quot;windy&quot;=true node is calculated using the entropy equation above. Since there is an equal number of yes&#x27;s and no&#x27;s in this node, we have

:formula_26

For the node where &quot;windy&quot;=false there were eight data points, six yes&#x27;s and two no&#x27;s. Thus we have

:formula_27

To find the information of the split, we take the weighted average of these two numbers based on how many observations fell into which node.

:formula_28

Now we can calculate the information gain achieved by splitting on the &quot;windy&quot; feature.

:formula_29

To build the tree, the information gain of each possible first split would need to be calculated. The best first split is the one that provides the most information gain. This process is repeated for each impure node until the tree is complete. This example is adapted from the example appearing in Witten et al.

Information gain is also known as Shannon index in bio diversity research.

===Variance reduction===
Introduced in CART, variance reduction is often employed in cases where the target variable is continuous (regression tree), meaning that use of many other metrics would first require discretization before being applied. The variance reduction of a node is defined as the total reduction of the variance of the target variable due to the split at this node:

:formula_30 of the feature &quot;savings&quot;, we need to note the quantity of each value. The original data contained three low&#x27;s, three medium&#x27;s, and two high&#x27;s. Out of the low&#x27;s, one had a good &quot;credit risk&quot; while out of the medium&#x27;s and high&#x27;s, 4 had a good &quot;credit risk&quot;. Assume a candidate split formula_31 such that records with a low &quot;savings&quot; will be put in the left child and all other records will be put into the right child.

:formula_32

To build the tree, the &quot;goodness&quot; of all candidate splits for the root node need to be calculated. The candidate with the maximum value will split the root node, and the process will continue for each impure node until the tree is complete.

Compared to other metrics such as information gain, the measure of &quot;goodness&quot; will attempt to create a more balanced tree, leading to more-consistent decision time. However, it sacrifices some priority for creating pure children which can lead to additional splits that are not present with other metrics.

==Uses==

===Advantages===
Amongst other data mining methods, decision trees have various advantages:
* Simple to understand and interpret. People are able to understand decision tree models after a brief explanation. Trees can also be displayed graphically in a way that is easy for non-experts to interpret.
* Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that have only one type of variable. (For example, relation rules can be used only with nominal variables while neural networks can be used only with numerical variables or categoricals converted to 0-1 values.) Early decision trees were only capable of handling categorical variables, but more recent versions, such as C4.5, do not have this limitation.
* Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalization. Since trees can handle qualitative predictors, there is no need to create dummy variables.
* Uses a white box or open-box model. If a given situation is observable in a model the explanation for the condition is easily explained by Boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model, the explanation for the results is typically difficult to understand, for example with an artificial neural network.
* Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.
* Non-parametric approach that makes no assumptions of the training data or prediction residuals; e.g., no distributional, independence, or constant variance assumptions
* Performs well with large datasets. Large amounts of data can be analyzed using standard computing resources in reasonable time.
* Accuracy with flexible modeling. These methods may be applied to healthcare research with increased accuracy.
* Mirrors human decision making more closely than other approaches. This could be useful when modeling human decisions/behavior.
* Robust against co-linearity, particularly boosting.
* In built feature selection. Additional irrelevant feature will be less used so that they can be removed on subsequent runs. The hierarchy of attributes in a decision tree reflects the importance of attributes. It means that the features on top are the most informative.
* Decision trees can approximate any Boolean function e.g. XOR.

===Limitations===
* Trees can be very non-robust. A small change in the training data can result in a large change in the tree and consequently the final predictions.
* The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristics such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. To reduce the greedy effect of local optimality, some methods such as the dual information distance (DID) tree were proposed.
* Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize well from the training data. (This is known as overfitting.) Mechanisms such as pruning are necessary to avoid this problem (with the exception of some algorithms such as the Conditional Inference approach, that does not require pruning).
* The average depth of the tree that is defined by the number of nodes or tests till classification is not guaranteed to be minimal or small under various splitting criteria. 
* For data including categorical variables with different numbers of levels, information gain in decision trees is biased in favor of attributes with more levels. To counter this problem, instead of choosing the attribute with highest information gain, one can choose the attribute with the highest information gain ratio among the attributes whose information gain is greater than the mean information gain. This biases the decision tree against considering attributes with a large number of distinct values, while not giving an unfair advantage to attributes with very low information gain. Alternatively, the issue of biased predictor selection can be avoided by the Conditional Inference approach, a two-stage approach, or adaptive leave-one-out feature selection.

===Implementations===
Many data mining software packages provide implementations of one or more decision tree algorithms (e.g. random forest).

Open source examples include:

* ALGLIB, a C++, C# and Java numerical analysis library with data analysis features (random forest)
* KNIME, a free and open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform (decision trees, random forest)
* Orange, an open-source data visualization, machine learning and data mining toolkit (random forest)
* R (an open-source software environment for statistical computing, which includes several CART implementations such as rpart, party and randomForest packages),
* scikit-learn (a free and open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language).
* Weka (a free and open-source data-mining suite, contains many decision tree algorithms),

In a decision tree, all paths from the root node to the leaf node proceed by way of conjunction, or &quot;AND&quot;. In a decision graph, it is possible to use disjunctions (ORs) to join two more paths together using minimum message length (MML). Decision graphs have been further extended to allow for previously unstated new attributes to be learnt dynamically and used at different places within the graph. The more general coding scheme results in better predictive accuracy and log-loss probabilistic scoring. In general, decision graphs infer models with fewer leaves than decision trees.

===Alternative search methods===
Evolutionary algorithms have been used to avoid local optimal decisions and search the decision tree space with little &quot;a priori&quot; bias.

It is also possible for a tree to be sampled using MCMC.

The tree can be searched for in a bottom-up fashion. Or several trees can be constructed parallelly to reduce the expected number of tests till classification.

<doc id="577011" wikidata="Q654347" url="?curid=577011" title="Libertatia">
<text>Libertatia (also known as Libertalia) was a purported pirate colony founded in the late 17th century in Madagascar under the leadership of Captain James Misson (last name occasionally spelled &quot;Mission&quot;, first name occasionally given as &quot;Olivier&quot;). The main source for Libertatia is Volume 2 of &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;, a 1724 book which describes Captain Misson and Libertatia. Little to no corroborating evidence for Libertatia beyond this account has been found, however. Whether Libertatia was real but somehow &quot;lost&quot; to history, a pirate legend that the author recorded based on interviews with sailors, or a concocted work of utopian fiction by the author from the start is contested.

==Background==

Libertalia was a legendary free colony founded by pirates led by Captain Misson, although most historians have expressed doubts over its existence outside of literature. Libertalia got its name from the Latin word &quot;liberi&quot; which means &quot;free&quot;. Misson&#x27;s idea was to have his society be one in which people of all colours, creeds, and beliefs were to be free of any scrutiny. He wanted to give the people of Libertalia their own demonym, not one of a past country of origin. Historian and activist Marcus Rediker describes the pirates as follows:

The pirates were against the authoritarian institutions of their day, including monarchies, slavery, institutional religion, and the abuses associated with wealth. Like some historically documented pirates, they practiced direct democracy, where the people as a whole held the authority to make laws and rules, and also used systems of councils composed of delegates who were supposed to think of themselves as &quot;comrades&quot; of the general population, not rulers. They created a new language for their colony and operated a socialist economy.

The pirate utopia&#x27;s motto was &quot;for God and liberty,&quot; and its flag was white, in contrast to a Jolly Roger.

== Captain James Misson ==
According to the account in &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;, Misson was French, born in Provence, and it was while he was in Rome on leave from the French warship &quot;Victoire&quot; that he lost his faith, disgusted by the decadence of the Papal Court. In Rome he ran into Caraccioli – a &quot;lewd Priest&quot; who over the course of long voyages with little to do but talk, gradually converted Misson and a sizeable portion of the rest of the crew to his way of thinking:

Embarking on a career of piracy, the 200 strong crew of the &quot;Victoire&quot; called upon Misson to be their captain. They shared the wealth of the ship, deciding &quot;all should be in common.&quot;

== Location ==
The consensus of modern scholarship is that Libertalia (or Libertatia) was not a real place, but a work of fiction. Journalist Kevin Rushby toured the area seeking descendants of pirate inhabitants without success, claiming “others have tried and failed many times”, although the Zana-Malata have historically claimed descent from pirates. There were pirate settlements on and around Madagascar, on which Libertalia may have been based: Abraham Samuel at Port Dauphin, Adam Baldridge at Ile Ste.-Marie, and James Plaintain at Ranter Bay were all ex-pirates who founded trading posts and towns. These locations appear frequently in official accounts and letters from the period, while Libertalia appears only in Johnson&#x27;s &quot;General History, Volume 2&quot;. Johnson writes about the overall set up of Libertalia. The settlement was purported to have an elevated fort on each side of the harbor with 40 guns in each fort, from the Portuguese. Below the fort, under the protection of the forts, was where the living quarters along with the rest of the town was located. Libertalia was located roughly 13 miles east-south-east of the nearest town.

== Criticism ==
Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Libertalia&quot; has been treated as completely fictional, as apocryphal, or as a utopian commentary. The inclusion of fictional accounts such as Misson&#x27;s in &quot;A General History&quot; has caused some modern scholars to discount the entire work as a reliable source, though other portions of it have been at least partially corroborated by various sources.

<doc id="577019" wikidata="Q435780" url="?curid=577019" title="Sammy Hagar">
<text>Sam Roy Hagar (born October 13, 1947), also known as the Red Rocker, is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He rose to prominence in the early 1970s with the hard rock band Montrose before launching a successful solo career, scoring a hit in 1984 with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Drive 55&quot;. He enjoyed further commercial success as the lead vocalist of Van Halen from 1985 through 1996, and from 2003 to 2005 

In 2007, Hagar was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Van Halen. His musical style primarily consists of hard rock and heavy metal.

A lifelong entrepreneur, Hagar founded four spirits brands and 13 restaurants. In 2008, with his wife, Kari Hagar, he founded a private non-profit focused on children&#x27;s causes and hunger relief, the Hagar Family Foundation.

== Early life ==
Sam Roy Hagar was born on October 13, 1947, to Robert Alton 
&quot;Bobby&quot; Hagar and Alberta &quot;Gladys&quot; ( Baio) Hagar in Salinas, California, and was named after his maternal grandfather, Sam Roy Baio. Despite claims that Hagar is of Lebanese descent, the musician has stated he is of Irish and Italian descent. His family worked in the lettuce fields and he lived with his parents and three siblings in a labor camp until moving south to Fontana, California. There, his father Bobby had landed a job at the Kaiser Steel Mill, working in the open hearth. Bobby Hagar was an alcoholic boxer who held a record for being knocked down 20 times in a single fight. Friends said he was &quot;mentally damaged&quot; upon returning home from fighting in World War II. &quot;My father was the town drunk,&quot; said Hagar, who described his father as &quot;a complete alcoholic and madman&quot; who was abusive towards his wife and children. Hagar&#x27;s mother would occasionally take the children to a nearby orange grove to sleep in the car when their father became too violent. The Hagar family moved frequently, as Bobby had a habit of spending the rent money on alcohol; Hagar recalls living in nine different homes in Fontana while growing up. When Hagar was ten years old, his mother Gladys took the children and left Bobby for good.

Growing up, Hagar would pick fruit, deliver newspapers, and mow lawns to earn money. He excelled academically and discovered music while in high school, teaching himself to play guitar on a $40 instrument purchased from a Sears catalog. He fronted his first band, the Fabulous Castilles, when he was 14 years old. At age 17, Hagar went to San Bernardino and sneaked in to see the 1964 US debut of the Rolling Stones at the Swing Auditorium. He also regularly attended concerts by surf guitarist Dick Dale at the Riverside National Guard Armory.

After graduating from high school, Hagar &quot;wanted to get out of Fontana as quickly as I could&quot;. He moved to nearby Riverside and played in a handful of local bands, while also landing a job running the music department at a local store. Hagar first joined the Johnny Fortune Band as lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist and subsequently played in a string of other pre-Montrose bands including Big Bang, Skinny, Dustcloud, Cotton, Jimmy, the Justice Brothers, and Manhole. The Justice Brothers were the house band at a bar called &quot;The Nightclub&quot; in San Bernardino, before they relocated to San Francisco. During this period in Riverside, Hagar met drummer David Lauser, who would become his friend and musical partner for decades to come. Hagar then got married and moved to San Francisco. 

At some point after landing in San Francisco, two members of his band were arrested on drug charges, and Hagar found himself broke and without a band. He subsequently spent several months driving a dump truck for his father-in-law in New York as a means of supporting himself until he could put a new band together.

In 1970, Hagar returned to Fontana with his wife and new baby, pursuing a career in music full-time. While in Fontana, he claims he was visited by &quot;a ship and two creatures inside of this ship&quot; while he lay in bed one night. &quot;And they were connected to me, tapped into my mind through some kind of mysterious wireless connection&quot;, he said of the experience, adding &quot;I was kind of waking up. They said, in their communication to each other, no words spoke, &#x27;Oh, he&#x27;s waking up. We&#x27;ve got to go.&#x27; They fired off a numerical code, but it was not of our numerical system. All of a sudden, pow, the connection instantly broke.&quot; The experience affected Hagar deeply and led him to travel to Yucaipa, California to consult a psychic, who told Hagar that he needed to go back to San Francisco where fame was awaiting him.

== Musical career ==
=== Montrose (1973–1975) ===
While playing in a San Francisco cover band, Hagar was discovered and recruited to join Montrose, a new band being put together by noted session guitarist Ronnie Montrose. Hagar appeared on the band&#x27;s debut and sophomore albums, which included the first song Hagar ever wrote, &quot;Bad Motor Scooter&quot;. After conflicts arose between himself and Ronnie Montrose during a European tour, Hagar was fired. Bassist Bill Church, whom Montrose had fired after the first album, and drummer Denny Carmassi eventually followed Hagar out of Montrose, playing with his backing band as he embarked on a solo career.

=== Solo career (1976–1987, 1997, 2008, 2013–2014) ===
By the late 1970s, Hagar was enjoying moderate success as a solo artist on Capitol Records under the tutelage of A&amp;R man Carter, with such albums as &quot;Nine on a Ten Scale&quot; and hits such as &quot;Red&quot;, which would build his persona and style, leading to his nickname as &quot;the Red Rocker&quot;. However, Hagar felt that Carter did not play to his strengths as &quot;a heavy-metal guy&quot; and instead tried to generate Top 40 hits (such as a cover of Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot;) with little success. Hagar opened for Boston during their 1978/1979 &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; tour, and was scheduled to continue in San Bernardino, California. Prior to the show, Hagar was replaced on the bill by the up-and-coming Los Angeles club band the Knack. Hagar split with Carter for his 1979 &quot;Street Machine&quot; album which he self-produced. But after it and 1980&#x27;s &quot;Danger Zone&quot; failed to break out, Hagar felt that Capitol was not supporting him sufficiently.

Hagar also penned songs that became hits for other bands, notably the top 10 rocker for Rick Springfield, &quot;I&#x27;ve Done Everything for You&quot;. Bette Midler recorded two Hagar songs, &quot;Keep on Rockin&quot; and &quot;Red&quot;.

Eddie Van Halen approached Hagar when they played a festival together in 1978 and told him that Montrose was his favorite band, referring to himself as a &quot;Montrose freak&quot;. Hagar has said that Eddie had been heavily influenced by Montrose, saying &quot;Not his soloing as much as the chording – yeah, he took some of that big open chord thing [from Montrose]. The big open A, the big open D, the big open E. Everything as open as you could make it, to make it as heavy as possible with one guitar. And that was pretty much Ronnie&#x27;s style, too.&quot;

Hagar left Capitol for the newly formed Geffen Records and made some personnel changes, including enlisting long-time friend and former Justice Brothers bandmate David Lauser as his drummer. His first Geffen release, &quot;Standing Hampton&quot;, was his biggest-selling album to date and went platinum on the strength of songs such as &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Way to Rock&quot;. The follow-up, &quot;Three Lock Box&quot;, generated his first pop Top 40 hit single and his highest-charting solo single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy&quot;, which peaked at No. 13 in early 1983.

Hagar continued to enjoy commercial success in the 1980s, with perhaps his best-known song, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Drive 55&quot;, from his 1984 album &quot;VOA&quot;, reaching No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles Chart and garnering heavy AOR airplay. By this time, Hagar had become a headlining act in many parts of the United States and Europe.

In 1987, Hagar had his first No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks with &quot;Give to Live&quot; from &quot;I Never Said Goodbye&quot;, released after he had joined Van Halen.

=== HSAS (1983–1984) ===
In 1983 and 1984, Hagar and guitarist Neal Schon of Journey formed the supergroup HSAS (Hagar Schon Aaronson Shrieve) along with former Foghat bassist Kenny Aaronson and former Santana drummer Michael Shrieve. HSAS did a small Christmas tour to benefit local charities and released an album, &quot;Through the Fire&quot;. The tracks which appeared on the album were recorded live, but crowd noise was removed during the mixing process to create the feel of a studio album. As intended from its start, HSAS was a short-lived project. One song in particular, a cover of &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, received some airplay, peaking at No. 94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles chart as &quot;Top of the Rock&quot; became an under-the-radar airplay favorite on AOR stations and in markets such as Seattle.

=== Van Halen (1985–1996) ===
In 1985 after parting ways with vocalist David Lee Roth, the remaining members of the band Van Halen contacted many potential replacements. In July, given Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s appreciation of Montrose and at his car mechanic&#x27;s suggestion, the band auditioned and quickly hired Hagar to fill the opening. With Hagar at the front, Van Halen produced four multi-platinum, number 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; charting albums: &quot;5150&quot;, &quot;OU812&quot;, &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot;, and &quot;Balance&quot;, as well as many chart hits, including nine number 1 Mainstream Rock hits. During Hagar&#x27;s stint as Van Halen&#x27;s vocalist, the band was often informally referred to by fans as &quot;Van Hagar&quot; as a way to distinguish the band from the previous David Lee Roth era.

Internal disputes eventually led to Hagar&#x27;s departure from the band in June 1996. Hagar disagreed with a decision to record two new tracks for a greatest hits album after the band had agreed to take time off following their 1995 world tour. This issue was pushed by Van Halen&#x27;s new manager Ray Danniels, Alex Van Halen&#x27;s brother-in-law, who was brought in after the death of their longtime manager Ed Leffler. Hagar wanted instead to record a new studio album, but only after Eddie, Alex, and Hagar&#x27;s pregnant wife had all dealt with their respective medical issues. Eventually the band decided to record two songs for the &quot;Twister&quot; soundtrack. The process was acrimonious and ultimately resulted in only one song, &quot;Humans Being&quot; - the other, &quot;Between Us Two&quot;, ended up unfinished and replaced with an instrumental played by Eddie and Alex - along with the end of Hagar&#x27;s tenure. Among the problems were how Hagar was with his wife in Hawaii, where they had arranged for a natural delivery of the baby, but the couple would eventually relocate to San Francisco after Hagar endured three trips to California to work on the songs, and arguments with Eddie regarding rewriting his lyrics and issuing a greatest hits album. Van Halen would then bring David Lee Roth back to record two new songs for said compilation, &quot;Best Of – Volume I&quot;. When Van Halen again parted ways with Roth, instead of rehiring Hagar, the band hired Gary Cherone, the former lead singer of Extreme, also managed by Danniels.

=== Los Tres Gusanos (1993–1996, 2002, 2005–present) ===

Having jammed as a trio in 1992, Hagar, drummer David Lauser, and Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony formed the harmony-singing rock band Los Tres Gusanos (in English, the Three Worms) in 1993. Playing a mixture of Hagar, Van Halen, and cover songs at Cabo Wabo and in San Francisco the band got together a few times a year. Initially active until 1996, Los Tres Gusanos regrouped in 2002, then again in 2005, and has performed together many times since. Lauser has gone on record to say, &quot;Los Tres Gusanos will never die and rumors abound that they may resurface in Cabo soon.&quot;

Musician Robert Berry stood in for Michael Anthony in 1996 and 1998 while the bass player fulfilled his touring commitments with Van Halen. 

Los Tres Gusanos has played at the BAMMIES (aka the California Music Awards) and is known for its live performances. Similarly, neither band has ever made any official releases, although a number of unofficial bootleg live recordings have been widely circulated on CD and download, though these tend to be credited to Van Halen even when Hagar refers to Los Tres Gusanos by name during the recorded performances. In 2021, Hagar claimed that, during the early years of Los Tres Gusanos&#x27; formation, he was offered a spot singing for metal band Pantera that did not come to fruition.

=== Sammy Hagar &amp; the Waboritas (1996–2005) ===

Hagar produced several solo records after the split with Van Halen in 1996. He hit No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1997 with &quot;Little White Lie&quot;. In 1999, he formed a long-term band, called the Waboritas: David Lauser returned on drums, as did Jesse Harms on keyboards, and new to the mix was former Bus Boys guitarist Vic Johnson, and former Tommy Tutone bassist Mona Gnader. Subsequent tours were known for spontaneity; such as improvising &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; by Johnny Cash at the IC Light Amphitheatre in Pittsburgh after the noise of a train disturbed the show.

In the summer of 2002, Roth and Hagar teamed up in the Song for Song, the Heavyweight Champs of Rock and Roll Tour (also known as the &#x27;Sans-Halen&#x27; or &#x27;Sam &amp; Dave&#x27; Tour). The tour attracted media and audience fascination because it seemed more improbable than even a Van Halen tour with Roth or Hagar. The tour drew large crowds and featured no opening acts; Roth and Hagar alternated as the first act. Roth contrasted his personality with Hagar&#x27;s: &quot;He&#x27;s the kind of guy you go out with to split a bottle with a friend. I&#x27;m the kind of guy you go out with if you want to split your friend with a bottle.&quot; Michael Anthony guested with Hagar&#x27;s Waboritas numerous times and sometimes even sang lead. During performances, Hagar teased Anthony by asking, &quot;Do the brothers know you&#x27;re here?&quot; Anthony never played with Roth. Gary Cherone appeared on occasion. Hagar released a live album (&quot;&quot;), featuring vocals by Mike and Gary, and a documentary DVD, &quot;Long Road to Cabo&quot;, about touring with Roth.

&quot;I thought that tour would be really cool, and it wasn&#x27;t,&quot; Hagar said. &quot;He [Roth] was so pompous and demanding. He&#x27;s a strange guy.&quot;

=== Planet Us (2002–2003) ===
In 2002, with Van Halen still unreformed at this point, Hagar joined again with guitarists Neal Schon of Journey and later Joe Satriani to form a new side project called Planet Us, along with Van Halen member Michael Anthony on bass and Deen Castronovo (also of Journey) on drums. Despite having big intentions, the band only recorded two songs and played live a few times before dissolving when Hagar and Anthony reunited with Van Halen. The two songs, &quot;Psycho Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Peephole&quot;, would not see release until Schon&#x27;s Soul SirkUS released &quot;Peephole&quot; on 2003&#x27;s &quot;World Play&quot; and Hagar&#x27;s 2008 effort, &quot;Cosmic Universal Fashion&quot;.

=== Reunion with Van Halen (2003–2005) ===

After the successful tour with David Lee Roth, Hagar started thinking about his former Van Halen bandmates, calling Alex in late 2003 following a tip from a mutual friend. In 2004, Van Halen toured with Hagar while releasing a 2-CD greatest hits album, titled &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, featuring three new Van Halen tracks fronted by Hagar.

The subsequent tour brought on more problems, however, most notably Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s alleged relapse into alcoholism. The relationship between Hagar and Van Halen eventually got so strained that they completed the tour using two separate charter jets, one for Hagar and Michael Anthony and one for Eddie and Alex. The tour ended with a somewhat infamous final show in Tucson, Arizona. As the show ended, Eddie smashed his guitar on stage sending shrapnel into the audience. This caused tensions backstage after the show, eliminating the possibility of a new album being recorded. Hagar said in an interview (and later confirmed in greater detail in his 2011 autobiography) that Eddie had changed and was not the same person anymore.

=== Sammy Hagar &amp; the Waboritas (2005–present) ===
In 2005, Hagar continued to play with the Waboritas as he toured the Atlantic coast and the Midwest and added ex-Van Halen bass player Michael Anthony. Hagar&#x27;s 2006 tour with the Waboritas also included a segment with Anthony, playing as a band called &quot;the Other Half&quot; (a reference to Hagar and Anthony being the half of Van Halen that was not Van Halen by name) for a set of songs in the middle of the show, including both Hagar- and Roth-era tunes. Hagar released an album and DVD called &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up! In St. Louis&quot; with the Wabos on July 25, 2006. Hagar has a longstanding and strong relationship with St. Louis. He often credits St. Louis fans and the radio station KSHE in St. Louis with helping to launch his professional career.

=== Chickenfoot (2008–present) ===
In 2008, Hagar formed a supergroup named Chickenfoot with Michael Anthony, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, and guitar virtuoso Joe Satriani. Their self-titled debut album was released in June 2009 and debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Chart. A brief tour was followed up by a second album, &quot;Chickenfoot III&quot; in 2011.

=== Sammy Hagar and the Circle (2014–present) ===

Hagar formed a new supergroup in 2014, featuring Michael Anthony, Waboritas guitarist Vic Johnson, and drummer Jason Bonham. The group was named Sammy Hagar and the Circle as according to Hagar, &quot;this band has kinda taken me full circle in my career&quot;, featuring tracks from his solo hits, along with Montrose, Van Halen, and Chickenfoot. Led Zeppelin songs were also featured in homage to Led Zeppelin due to the fact that Jason is the son of Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. Focusing on Sammy Hagar and the Circle meant Chickenfoot would be put on hiatus, helped by the fact the other supergroup gave Hagar some frustration in &quot;spending a half-million on a record, writ[ing] and record[ing] for six months. It&#x27;s a lot of work, and then to not sell many records.&quot; Sammy Hagar and the Circle began touring in 2014, with a live recording released on the album, &quot;At Your Service&quot; in May 2015. 

In August 2015, it was reported that the Circle were having discussions about making a studio record to follow up their live album, with Hagar stating, &quot;I want to see what [the Circle] can do in the studio, I&#x27;ve got a vibe on what I think this band will be, and it ain&#x27;t classic rock, believe it or not. I want to play, like American folk rock, with a heavy edge. Remember the Band? Yeah, write lyrics about America, and about the world. I just have a feeling that this band might be able to do that really well. We&#x27;ll find out.&quot; Sammy Hagar and the Circle&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Space Between&quot; was released May 10, 2019, on BMG. The album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart, No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Album Sales chart, No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s US Independent Albums chart, and No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Rock Albums chart. The sales start marked Hagar&#x27;s third-largest sales week since Nielsen Music began tracking data in 1991.

*In 2007, Hagar starred in a number of National Automotive Parts Association (NAPA) commercials with Nextel Cup drivers Michael Waltrip and Dale Jarrett. The campaign centered around Hagar&#x27;s song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Drive 55&quot;, changing the words to &quot;I Can&#x27;t Drive the 55&quot;, a reference to Waltrip&#x27;s car number 55.
*Hagar covered the Patti Smith song &quot;Free Money&quot; early in his career. In 2007, Smith and Van Halen were both inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. &quot;Free Money&quot; was prominently featured in a video montage of Smith&#x27;s performances. At the end of the induction show, Hagar jammed with Smith to her song &quot;People Have the Power&quot;.
*Hagar appeared in &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot; on The Biography Channel. He told of how he was awakened by his estranged father, drunkenly pounding on his door and demanding to see his new grandson. Hagar angrily sent him away. Moments later, the loud knocking resumed but when Hagar opened the door, it was a bandmate telling him that his father had been found dead earlier that night.
*Hagar made a guest appearance with Chickenfoot on the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; episode &quot;IAMAPOD&quot; in 2010.
*In 2012, Hagar appeared in episode 30 of the third season of American Restoration in which he commissioned Rick to create a custom rum dispenser out of a restored vintage refrigerator.

=== Business interests ===

*In the 1990s, Hagar bought a mountain bike store and built another one named Sausalito Cyclery, soon rated the number 1 independent bike store in California. Hagar designed a mountain bike called the &quot;Red Rocker&quot;, built with a red frame by Gary Fisher and black components with no chrome.
*Hagar owns a nightclub and restaurant in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, called Cabo Wabo Cantina, where the video for the 1999 hit song &quot;Mas Tequila&quot; (from the 1999 &quot;Red Voodoo&quot; album) was filmed. Hagar plays at the club during his annual autumn &quot;Birthday Bash&quot;. Hagar also has opened another nightclub in the franchise in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and markets a highly successful line of premium tequilas by the same Cabo Wabo name. Cabo Wabo Cantina opened in Fresno on August 29, 2008. However, it closed a few months later when the operator had a falling out with Hagar. In November 2009, a Cabo Wabo Cantina opened in the Planet Hollywood Hotel&#x27;s Miracle Mile shopping mall, directly on the strip in Las Vegas.
*In early 2009, Hagar opened &quot;Sammy&#x27;s Beach Bar &amp; Grill&quot; at Harrah&#x27;s Casino in St. Louis. He opened other locations at the McCarran Airport in Las Vegas, Hopkins International Airport in Cleveland, Kahului Airport in Maui, and the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu. Hagar donates all of the profits of both locations to local charities.
*It was announced on May 7, 2007, that Hagar was selling an 80% interest in his Cabo Wabo Tequila to Gruppo Campari, the world&#x27;s seventh-largest spirits company, for $80 million (). Skyy Spirits of San Francisco, a vodka producer and subsidiary of Milan&#x27;s Gruppo Campari will market Cabo Wabo globally, with continued participation by Hagar. Gerry Ruvo, president and chief executive of Skyy Spirits said &quot;Sammy has done a fantastic job building the brand, so we are going to obviously spend time with him and work with him to continue our efforts to take the brand to an even larger level, both here in the U.S. and, more important, globally.&quot; Ruvo said Great Britain, Spain, Australia, Southeast Asia, Japan, Germany, and Italy are considered key expansion markets for Tequila. Hagar created Cabo Wabo Tequila to serve patrons at his Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. He began to distribute it in 1999. In 2007, his company sold 147,000 cases, making it the second-best-selling premium Tequila in the United States, he said in a telephone interview. Cabo Wabo Enterprises, based in Novato, California, earned about $60 million in sales in 2007. In 2010, he sold the remaining 20% interest in Cabo Wabo Tequila to Gruppo Campari for $11 million (bringing the total to $91 million).
*In the summer of 2010, Hagar opened a beach bar at the Ballys Casino on the Atlantic City beach, which suffered extensive damage in Hurricane Sandy, and was not reopened.
*When asked how he has balanced being a rock star and tequila mogul, Hagar responded: &quot;I always had other people doing everything. It was my palate and my concept. I would go in taste and say, &#x27;Leave this in the barrel a little bit longer.&#x27; That was my job. I could do that right before I went on stage. That&#x27;s a perfect time to do it, as a matter of fact!&quot;
*In November 2011, Hagar launched &quot;Sammy&#x27;s Beach Bar Rum&quot; in Hawaii. It is distilled on Maui by Hali&#x27;imaile Distilling Company. It is currently being rolled out to other North American markets.
*In 2009, Hagar and celebrity chef Tyler Florence opened a restaurant together in Mill Valley, California. Called El Paseo, it is a steakhouse, with Hagar&#x27;s contribution being focused on the wine and music selection.
* In 2015, Hagar launched a weekly radio show called &quot;Sammy Hagar&#x27;s Top Rock Countdown&quot;, supported by Envisage Radio Group, where he puts together various-genre playlists of his favorite songs. As of August 2018, the show has been syndicated across 90 radio stations.
*In 2016, Hagar launched a new television program on Mark Cuban&#x27;s network AXS TV. The show, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Road Trip with Sammy Hagar&quot;, follows Sammy around on the road talking with musical and entertainment guests as well as a jam session on each episode. Season Four kicked off in May 2019. The first episode of Season 5 aired in April 2020. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, production was paused but will resume when it can be done safely.
*In 2019, Hagar teamed up with Guy Fieri to launch Santo tequila brand.

=== Author ===
In March 2011, Hagar released an autobiography entitled &quot;Red: My Uncensored Life in Rock&quot;, written with the assistance of rock critic Joel Selvin. On April 3, 2011, it reached No. 1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list of hardcover nonfiction.

During an interview with the &quot;American Rock Scene&quot;, Hagar announced the forthcoming paperback version of &quot;Red&quot; would include an additional chapter, stating that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to release the same book again.&quot;

In September 2015, Hagar released the cookbook &quot;Are We Having Any Fun Yet? – The Cooking &amp; Partying Handbook&quot;. The book contains food and drink recipes, along with pictures and stories of Hagar&#x27;s cooking memories.

== Backing bands ==
During his solo career, Hagar has had a number of backing bands. Many played with him on a regular basis as more than just guest musicians. Generally these musicians also record most of the backing vocals for Hagar&#x27;s albums. The most notable and longest standing group of Hagar&#x27;s is called the Waboritas who were founded in 1997 for the &quot;Marching to Mars Tour&quot;. Also, time spent in Van Halen interrupted Hagar&#x27;s solo career; it was on hiatus from 1985 to 1996 other than small returns to studio work in 1987 and 1993. When Hagar went on tour with Van Halen in 2004, the band were paid to be held on reserve for Hagar after the tour, despite the band going into a temporary hiatus for the duration

Hagar put the Waboritas on lifetime salary/vacation again, with the understanding that when he wanted to play with them they would be there ready to play, in 2009 following Hagar&#x27;s involvement in the band Chickenfoot. Initially, Hagar reported he would only occasionally play with the Wabos from then on, for shows at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, particularly his annual birthday concert. However, due to commitments of other members of Chickenfoot slowing the band&#x27;s progress, Hagar has performed more than he initially planned to with the Wabos lineup.

Note on lineups, Hagar sometimes played all guitar parts on records, hence the list of guitar players having gaps.

== Equipment ==
Hagar previously endorsed Yamaha guitars, which produced a line of Hagar signature guitars named the Yamaha AES620 SH. The guitar is based on Yamaha&#x27;s AES620 and features a number of modifications requested by Hagar, including a Seymour Duncan JB pickup in the bridge position, a &quot;Cabo Wabo&quot; inlay at the 12th fret and custom translucent red finish. In addition to his signature model, Hagar also plays a handmade AES920 solid-body guitar. Previously, Hagar collaborated with Washburn Guitars, which made a Hagar signature guitar named Washburn RR150, which featured Seymour Duncan pickups and a piezo pickup incorporated into the bridge. In recent years, Hagar has switched to Gibson Guitars, having two signatures by them: the &quot;Red Rocker&quot; Les Paul, and the Sammy Hagar Explorer.

Hagar has used Crate Amplifiers, which marketed a Hagar signature 120-watt amplifier named Crate BV120RH Red Voodoo Amp Head. Currently, he uses Blackstar and Marshall amps, making use of the Marshall Vintage Modern 2466 head and Blackstar Series One 100-watt head.

== Personal life ==

Hagar married his first wife, Betsy Berardi, on November 3, 1968. They have two sons. In 1994, the couple divorced after 26 years of marriage. He married his current wife, Kari Hagar, on November 29, 1995, and together they have two daughters. In 2008, they founded the Hagar Family Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit focused on children&#x27;s causes and hunger relief for families in need. 

He is the cousin of Christian metal singer Ken Tamplin, who has performed with Joshua, Shout and Magdallan and on his own.

He is a long-time Ferrari enthusiast and owns a 2008 Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano F1. He owns the 1982 Ferrari 512BB that appeared in his &quot;I Can&#x27;t Drive 55&quot; music video.

In January 2024, Hagar appeared on an episode of PBS&#x27; &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; in which he was informed that his Y-DNA did not match any men with the surname Hagar. His Y-DNA matched 27 men with the last name Belcher. Further analysis determined that his great-great-grandfather, born in Virginia in 1845, was fathered by a Belcher and not the Hagar named in the paper records.

<doc id="577026" wikidata="Q1328096" url="?curid=577026" title="Boredoms">
<text>Boredoms () (later known as V∞redoms) is a rock band from Osaka, Japan formed in 1986. The band&#x27;s sound is often referred to as noise rock, or sometimes Japanoise (Japan’s noise music scene), though their more recent records have moved toward repetitive psychedelic rock, ambient soundscapes, and tribal drumming.

The band has a vast discography. Many band members have rotated through the group over the years, often using a number of various stage names. Singer Yamantaka Eye is the closest the band has to a frontman; his style includes a range of baffling screams, babbling, electronic effects, and very heavy post-production. Drummer/keyboard player/vocalist Yoshimi P-We is featured on most Boredoms recordings.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
Boredoms were formed in early 1986 by Yamantaka Eye, who at the time acted as front man for the infamous and highly controversial noise/performance art act Hanatarash, locally notorious for its extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on-stage destruction and complete disregard for the audience&#x27;s safety. The antics of Hanatarash would later be highly influential on the earliest incarnation of Boredoms, which was formed by the remaining members of a band Eye started with Hanatarash drummer Ikuo Taketani, as well as guitarist Tabata Mitsuru (known as Tabata Mara), bassist Hosoi Hisato, and vocalist Makki Sasarato, called &quot;Acid Makki &amp; Combi and Zombie&quot;. The band&#x27;s sound was characterized by violent, noisy punk rock/no wave thrashings. They recorded a single track, &quot;U.S.A.&quot;, for a compilation tape. Shortly after the release of their first song, Taketani was replaced on drums by Yoshikawa Toyohito, a friend of Eye&#x27;s. The band officially changed their name to Boredoms after Hira replaced Hosoi on bass, and Sasarato left the band due to creative differences. The band&#x27;s name comes from the Buzzcocks song &quot;Boredom&quot;.

With the band finally reaching a level of stability, Eye and Tabata recorded their first official EP, &quot;Anal by Anal&quot;, in mid-1986. In early 1987, Tabata left the group to later join Zeni Geva and was replaced by Seiichi Yamamoto as guitar player. In March 1988, the band released its first full-length, &quot;Osorezan no Stooges Kyo&quot;. Due to unhappiness over Yoshikawa&#x27;s drumming, Yoshimi P-We from Eye&#x27;s Hanatarash-related project UFO or Die was asked to serve as drummer, becoming the first female member of the band, with Yoshikawa switching to general percussion. Shortly after the change Yoshikawa left the group, to be replaced by Chew Hasegawa (now of Japanese funeral doom band Corrupted) and then by Kazuya Nishimura, known by his stage name Atari. The band&#x27;s sound from this period was marked by harsh, dissonant punk edited extensively by Eye in the studio, citing Sonic Youth and Funkadelic as influences, among others. This style was seen by some as &quot;pointlessly abrasive&quot; without any underlying motive, making Boredoms nihilistic absolute music, according to some critics; however, the strangeness of the record increased the band&#x27;s popularity in the musical underground.

===Growing popularity===
In 1988 and 1989, Eye found himself making friends with Sonic Youth and also worked extensively with John Zorn&#x27;s polystylistic Naked City project, serving as guest vocalist. After the release of Boredoms&#x27; album &quot;Soul Discharge&quot; in the United States, the band was able to parlay their growing popularity into long term record deals with Warner Bros. Records in Japan and its United States imprint Reprise Records. With the release of the band&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Pop Tatari&quot;, generally seen as one of the strangest albums ever released by a major label, Boredoms took to the road and toured with Sonic Youth in 1992, Nirvana for eight consecutive shows in late October and early November 1993, and Brutal Truth in 1993. During this period, the band was asked by Steve Albini to record a track for a compilation he was recording. Shortly after Eye again collaborated with John Zorn on an EP under the name Mystic Fugu Orchestra, which was notably the first album released on Zorn&#x27;s Tzadik Records.

The following year, at the height of its popularity in the United States, the band was asked to perform on the main stage of the 1994 Lollapalooza tour in support of the album &quot;Chocolate Synthesizer&quot;, which had just been released in the United States. The album proved largely successful for such an experimental band and was later considered one of the best albums of the 1990s by Alternative Press magazine. Yoshikawa had later joined the band in the early months of 1994 for a second time to play on &quot;Pop Tatari&quot;, often sharing vocal duties with Eye, but left again in 1994 and was replaced on percussion by EDA, who had been introduced to the band by Pavement bassist Mark Ibold. The band was dropped from the Reprise roster, with Birdman Records distributing the band&#x27;s &quot;Super Roots&quot; EPs during this period.

By the time of 1998&#x27;s &quot;Super Go!!!!!&quot; EP and full-length &quot;Super æ&quot;, the band started to break sharply from their earlier atonal noise rock/Japanoise sound by introducing many elements of sweeping electronica effects and thoroughly constructed psychedelic rock jams into their music. Perceived analogies with the music of Can became common during this period. Described as &quot;tumultuous space-sludge&quot;, &quot;Super æ&quot; has most often been compared to the defining elements of 1970s krautrock. Soon after its initial release in Japan, &quot;Super æ&quot; was met with a considerable amount of acclaim from the international music press, recognized as a modern-day avant-garde artifact and progressive &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Notably, &quot;Super æ&quot; was considered one of the best albums of the 1990s by Pitchfork Media.
In 1999, the band released &quot;Vision Creation Newsun&quot; in Japan. This album saw an evolution in their sound, combining the evolving space rock themes explored in their &quot;Super Roots&quot; EPs and preceding album &quot;Super æ&quot; with &quot;a much more earthly, primal, primitively worshipful inspiration&quot;. It features psychedelic soundscaping and &quot;cosmic synths&quot;, complex tribal drumming, &quot;cathartic celebrations of noise&quot;, and Eye&#x27;s unique power electronic and turntabalistic stylings. The album is often considered the band&#x27;s greatest achievement thus far, and has been described by critics as blending the &quot;manic, high-speed, cut-up form punk rock&quot; of their earlier albums with a new sound that is &quot;just as intense and exhilarating, but more beautiful and more expansive&quot;.

After its release, Eye oversaw a series of remix albums of the Boredoms catalogue by guest DJs. After the final remix album, Eye&#x27;s own &quot;Rebore, vol. 0&quot;, was released in 2000, Boredoms seemed to disappear for a few years with no releases or tour dates, while the members participated in various side projects and other bands.

===Later activities===
Rumors that the band had broken up began to circulate, but a smaller ensemble who called themselves V∞redoms resurfaced in 2003. The group&#x27;s line-up had changed considerably upon its return, stripping down to a much smaller ensemble with Yamantaka Eye on vocals, Izumi Kiyoshi (who had performed on &quot;Vision Creation Newsun&quot; and &quot;Super æ&quot;) on synthesizer, and Yoshimi P-We, Nishimura, and EDA playing drums and percussion.

Despite the changes, the group&#x27;s music still revolves around the tribal drumming patterns heard on &quot;Vision Creation Newsun&quot;. The band was signed by Vice Records for its releases in the United States since it had been dropped by Reprise. All &quot;Super Roots&quot; releases were then reissued on Vice in early 2007 (with the exclusion of &quot;Super Roots 2&quot;). In late 2004, Boredoms released its first album as a group in four years, &quot;Seadrum/House of Sun&quot;, most of which had been previously recorded before the band&#x27;s brief hiatus. This release also saw the band move from their label WEA Japan to the smaller Japanese label Commmons. The album was not celebrated to the extent of their previous albums, yet it still garnered mostly positive reviews, with a score of 73% on Metacritic. Following its release, EDA left the band and went on to form audio-visual project Adrena Adrena with visual artist Daisy Dickinson. EDA was replaced in the Boredoms by Yojiro Tatekawa.

In early 2007, the group released &quot;Super Roots 9&quot;, the first addition to the &quot;Super Roots&quot; series since 1999 and their first major release since &quot;Seadrum/House of Sun&quot;. It was recorded during a Christmas Eve 2004 concert, making it only the band&#x27;s third official live release since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Super Seeeeee!!!!!!&quot; video (discounting disc two of the &quot;Vision Creation Newsun&quot; boxset, which included a 35-minute excerpt of a live concert). &quot;Super Roots 9&quot; also saw the band move from Warner International to the smaller Japanese label Commmons for domestic releases and American label Thrill Jockey for overseas. Later, in April, the group (as V∞redoms) played three dates with Sonic Youth in Japan. The band also planned to attempt using newly developed contact microphones to record the sounds made by the human body while dancing.

The band released a live DVD/CD combination called &quot;Live at Sunflancisco&quot; in December 2007 followed by the remix single &quot;Voaltz / Relerer&quot; in August 2008, while Eye and Yoshimi have come out with new records of their own this year. During a 2008 United States tour with Iron &amp; Wine, Eye used a new seven-necked guitar called the &quot;Sevener&quot; or &quot;Sevena&quot;.

The band released another addition to the &quot;Super Roots&quot; EP series, titled &quot;Super Roots 10&quot;, on January 28, 2009.

====Boadrum performances and concerts ====
On July 7, 2007, Boredoms performed a concert entitled 77 Boadrum at the Empire–Fulton Ferry section of Brooklyn Bridge Park in Brooklyn, New York City New York with drummer Muneomi Senju replacing Nishimura. The &quot;77&quot; denoted not only the date (7/7/2007) and the start time (7:07pm EDT) but also the number of drummers in the ensemble. Eye has said that the number 77 became significant to him when he climbed the Sun Temple and counted 77 steps.

The band continued the concept on August 8, 2008, with two concerts called 88 Boadrum held in Los Angeles and Brooklyn. Boredoms headlined the Los Angeles show while Gang Gang Dance conducted the Brooklyn show. At 8:08pm PDT on 8/8/08, 88 drummers played for 88 minutes at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. A third concert, Boadrum 9, took place on September 9, 2009 at 9:09pm EDT at Terminal 5 in Manhattan, New York City. It featured 9 drummers in total, two from Boredoms (Yoshimi and Yojiro) and seven others from prominent experimental music acts, namely Zach Hill (Hella), Hisham Bharoocha (Soft Circle, ex: Black Dice, Lightning Bolt), Butchy Fuego (Pit er Pat), Kid Millions (Oneida), Jeremy Hyman (Ponytail), Dave Nuss (No-Neck Blues Band) and Aaron Moore (Volcano The Bear)

In 2010, Boredoms toured internationally including two Boadrum performances at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties curated by Matt Groening at Butlins Minehead, England, in addition to shows in London, Japan, Mexico and as part of the Melbourne International Arts Festival on October 10, 2010.

The last numbered Boadrum event was 111Boadrum, on November 11, 2011, at Byron Bay at 11:11am. Notable drummers included Zach Hill, Hisham Bharoocha, Jermey Hyman, Butchey Fuego, and Mat Watson. There were 11 drummers and 100 cymbal players for a total of 111 performers.

In 2011, Boredoms premiered new material at the All Tomorrows Parties &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot; festival in Tokyo. Six drummers were arranged in a circle around Eye, who used motion sensors to trigger ambient drone soundscapes created by Shinji Masuko that corresponded to each drummer. The music featured highly repetitive motorik rhythms that grew in complexity over the course of the hour long set. The band was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead, England. That gig (performed twice during the festival) featured 14 guitarists and 6 drummers.

In June 2015, Boredoms performed another development of the Boardrum series at the Barbican Centre in London, UK as part of Doug Aitken&#x27;s &quot;Station to Station: A 30-Day Happening&quot;. The performance featured Eye, Yoshimi, Tatekawa, Masuko, and an expanded lineup of drummers and guitarists surrounded by 88 percussionists all playing cymbals.

<doc id="577030" wikidata="Q238817" url="?curid=577030" title="Raymond Flynn">
<text>Raymond Leo Flynn (born July 22, 1939) is an American politician who served as the mayor of Boston, Massachusetts, from 1984 until 1993. He also served as United States Ambassador to the Holy See from 1993 to 1997.

Flynn was an All-American college basketball player at Providence College. During his senior year, Flynn was selected the &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; in the 1963 National Invitation Tournament. After a brief professional basketball career, Flynn worked in several fields, including as a high school teacher and a probation officer, before entering politics. As a politician, Flynn was regarded to be a economic liberal and a cultural conservative. Flynn began his political career as a Democratic member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1971 to 1979, representing the South Boston neighborhood during the turbulent Boston desegregation busing crisis of the early 1970s. Flynn opposed federally-mandated school busing. Throughout his political career, Flynn held a strong anti-abortion position. Flynn was As a state legislator, Flynn co-authored the &quot;Flynn–Doyle amendment&quot; to ban government funding of abortions covered by Medicaid. This was initially successfully vetoed by Governor Michael Dukakis. However a version of the amendment was passed over Dukakis&#x27;s veto in 1978. Flynn served on the Boston City Council from 1978 to 1984. As a city councilor, Flynn stood in opposition to rate increases by utility companies and regularly proposed tenants&#x27; rights ordinances.

Flynn was elected mayor of Boston in 1983 and took office in 1984. Flynn was reelected in 1987 and 1991. Polls showed Flynn to enjoy strong approval from Bostonians during his mayoralty. As mayor, Flynn balanced the city&#x27;s budget, eliminating a large budget deficit. To address the deficit, Flynn lobbied heavily for the passage of a revenue package for the city in the Massachusetts Legislature to provide additional state aid to the city and the authorization for the city to raise new local taxes. In 1985, a revenue package was passed and signed into law by Governor Dukakis. In response to discriminatory practices studies found banks to be practicing in Boston, Flynn took actions which persuaded banks to reach a $400 million community reinvestment agreement with the city. Flynn succeeded in getting legislation passed to replace the city&#x27;s publicly elected school board with the new Boston School Committee, members of which are appointed by the city&#x27;s mayor. Flynn would quickly come to express his regret about this change. In 1990, Flynn saw strong criticism from Black leaders over the Boston Police Department&#x27;s handling of the investigation into the murder of Carol Stuart. As mayor, Flynn advanced plans to desegregate the city&#x27;s public housing, and made efforts to heal the city&#x27;s racial divides. Flynn&#x27;s mayoral administration granted neighborhood groups more of a voice in the use of the city&#x27;s development and planning authorities in their neighborhoods. This included innovative move of granting the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative powers of eminent domain. Flynn successfully fought to enact rent control laws and strong tenants&#x27; rights laws. Flynn also served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors from 1991 to 1992.

Flynn resigned as mayor in 1993 in order to accept an appointment by President Bill Clinton as ambassador to the Holy See. He expanded the position&#x27;s mission to involve participation in addressing problem areas around the world. During his tenure as ambassador, he also encountered some controversy. In 1998, Flynn unsuccessfully ran for the United States House of Representatives. Flynn later served as president of Catholic Alliance, a nonpartisan Catholic advocacy group.

==Early life and education==
Flynn was born July 22, 1939, the son of Stephen Flynn and Lillian Flynn (). He grew up in South Boston, where he has spent most of his life living. Flynn is Irish-American. His father was a union longshoreman, and his mother was a cleaning lady. Flynn&#x27;s father was an immigrant to the United States. Flynn grew up a member of the Gate of Heaven Parish in South Boston.

As a kid, Flynn worked as a &quot;ball boy&quot; for the Boston Celtics basketball team during their home games at Boston Garden. He was a three-sport star athlete at South Boston High School.

Flynn attended Providence College on a basketball sports scholarship. Flynn was an All-American college basketball player at Providence College, and during his senior year was selected as the &quot;most valuable player&quot; in the 1963 National Invitation Tournament.

Later in life, while a Boston city councilor, Flynn would receive a master&#x27;s degree in education from Harvard University in 1981.

==Early professions==
In April 1963, he was selected by the Syracuse Nationals in the fourth round of the NBA draft. The Nationals relocated to Philadelphia to become the 76ers, but Flynn did not play for them, as he spent part of the 1963–64 season with the Wilmington Blue Bombers of the Eastern Professional Basketball League. Philadelphia traded his NBA rights to the Boston Celtics in September 1964, and in October he was the last player cut from the Celtics roster.

Flynn enlisted in the United States Army and was stationed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and Fort Dix in New Jersey. Before his political career, he worked as a youth worker, high school teacher, a probation officer, and a longshoreman. While working as a probation officer for the Suffolk County Superior Court from 1965 through 1970, he investigated criminal cases.

In his early political involvement, Flynn was a confidante and political supporter of U.S. House Speaker John W. McCormack, who was also a resident of South Boston. Flynn worked as a personal family assistant to Vice President Hubert Humphrey during Humphrey&#x27;s campaign in the 1968 presidential election.

==Massachusetts House of Representatives (1971–1978)==
Capitalizing on his local sports hero celebrity, Flynn won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in November 1970. As a state representative, Flynn was generally representative of the views of his South Boston district&#x27;s constituency. He was pro-trade unions, for affordable housing and tenants rights, opposed to redlining, opposed to expansion at Logan Airport, and opposed cutting welfare programs. Peter Dreier would later describe his positions as a state representative as having, largely, been a &quot;parochial South Boston pol with progressive leanings.&quot; South Boston, which Flynn represented, was regarded to be relatively politically conservative.

===Education policy and opposition to desegregation busing===
Flynn was an opponent of court ordered desegregation busing. In 1973, he worked against implementing the city of Boston&#x27;s desegregation school busing plan even filing a lawsuit against the Massachusetts Board of Education over the matter. Flynn argued that desegregation busing would pit poor Black and poor White families against one another within a second-tier school system, all while wealthy suburbanites sent their students to well-funded schools. Flynn refused to join the militant anti-busers, Louise Day Hicks and William Bulger when they released a statement of resistance that was seen as having racist overtones. Flynn urged against violent actions that were being taken by some in protest of busing. As a result of his refusal to join the more militant factions of resistance to busing, Flynn alienated himself from the more extremist factions of his community. His car was firebombed, and his family received death threats through telephone calls.

In 1974, Flynn filed legislation to repeal a state law which required that children attend school. During his 1983 mayoral campaign, he came to call this proposal a mistake. Flynn was a supporter of providing more state funding to special needs students in schools.

===Ban on government funding of abortion===
Flynn co-authored a bill to end government funding of abortions covered by Medicaid. The bill, co-authored with State Representative Charles R. Doyle. Public opponents of the bill founded of the Abortion Action Coalition advocacy organization, a short-lived organization which supported access to abortion.
The bill was passed by the state legislature, but was successfully vetoed by Governor Michael Dukakis. Flynn and Doyle then, later that year, attached the bill as a rider to a state pay-raise bill which was passed by the Massachusetts State Legislature. This was again vetoed by Dukakis. The &quot;Flynn-Doyle amendment&quot; was successfully passed over Dukakis&#x27; veto in 1978, after Flynn had already left the legislature to serve on the Boston City Council.

The law was undercut in 1981, when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that women with Medicaid eligibility had a constitutionally-protected entitlement to receive funding through the program for their abortions.

===Unsuccessful 1975 campaigns for city office===
In March 1975, Flynn announced himself as a candidate for the 1975 Boston mayoral election. However, he withdrew in June after struggling to fundraise and instead launched his candidacy for the Boston City Council. He would lose his race for city council that November, falling a mere 1,467 votes shy of election.

==Boston City Council (1978–1984)==
Flynn was elected to the Boston City Council in November 1977. Flynn would be reelected in 1979 and 1981. In 1981, Flynn was the top vote-getter by a large margin. On the council, Flynn served as chairman of the Committee on Housing and Neighborhood Development, Committee on Government Relations and Government Finance, as well as the Special Committee on School Matters.

Peter Dreier would later describe Flynn as having transitioned as a city councilor, &quot;from a parochial neighborhood politician with progressive leanings to a crusader with citywide appeal.&quot; while on the Boston City Council. Drier would describe Flynn as having been an &quot;18-hour-a-day workaholic&quot;, and the &quot;hardest working City Councilor&quot;. He had a reputation for regularly attending public meetings.

As a city councilor, Flynn opposed rate increases by utility companies. He was viewed as an ally of trade unions, welfare recipients, and working women. Flynn regularly proposed tenants&#x27; rights ordinances on the Boston City Council, which were defeated. Flynn believed that his city council colleagues were influenced by sizable donations from the real estate lobby, especially faulting the Greater Boston Real Estate Board. In 1983, Dudley Clendinen of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of Flynn&#x27;s politics, 

Flynn supported the potential adoption of rent control. He supported the idea of implementing linkage fees that would require those developing large projects to provide a percentage of money to affordable housing. He also directed his attention to matters such as aircraft noise pollution and homelessness.

In October 1979, Flynn, together with Joseph F. Timilty, rescued a Black man from a threatening encounter with a White mob on the Boston Common.

==1983 mayoral campaign==


In April 1983, Flynn announced his candidacy for mayor of Boston. In the October nonpartisan primary election, Flynn and State Representative Mel King placed atop the results, advancing to the general election. King was the first African American to be a candidate in a Boston mayoral general election. Both Flynn and King had originally been viewed as underdogs in the primary election. Flynn defeated King in the general election. Flynn and King had known each other since childhood, meeting through both playing basketball, and had both served as state representatives at the same time and worked together there on legislation. They would ultimately have a lifelong friendship, despite having run against each other for mayor.

Flynn&#x27;s campaign received no significant financial support from major sectors of the city&#x27;s business community. Flynn outright refused to accept campaign donations from developers with projects pending before city agencies, or lawyers of such developers. Both the Flynn and King campaigns had low expenditures compared to the nearly $2 million campaign that outgoing mayor Kevin White and the political machine supporting him had spent on his candidacies in the 1975 and 1979 mayoral elections. Flynn&#x27;s campaign spent roughly $400,000, while King&#x27;s spent less than $350,000.

Dudley Clendinen wrote that Flynn had worked to establish himself as a champion of the poor and elderly and to appeal across ethnic lines to ethnic minority voters. While Flynn had earlier in his political career opposed gay rights issues, by the time of his mayoral campaign he was making an active effort to court the gay vote. At the time, gay communities across the United States were becoming more politically organized.

===Primary election===
Flynn first announced his candidacy in front of a public housing project, pledging that he would be a &quot;people&#x27;s mayor&quot;. He was viewed as an underdog at the start of his campaign, due to a lack of funding, a political organization, or connections to the business or media establishments.

Flynn and King had both shaped the narrative of the debate during the hotly-contested primary, successfully creating a &quot;downtown versus the neighborhoods&quot; narrative, with Flynn and King taking the side of being in support of the city&#x27;s neighborhoods. A major item of debate was linkage, a fee that would be placed on downtown developers to raise funds for affordable housing. Flynn and King placed in the primary above candidates who were perceived as more representative of &quot;downtown&quot; interests. Coinciding with the primary, voters also strongly approved non-binding referendums in favor of a linkage policy and the creation of neighborhood councils. Both referendums had been supported by the group Massachusetts Fair Share. Flynn and King were the only two candidates who supported imposing linkage fees.

During the primary, the city&#x27;s progressive activists were largely sharply divided between Flynn and King&#x27;s candidacies. Flynn benefited from grassroots support.

===General election===
In the general election, Flynn received the political endorsement of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;&#x27;s editorial board. Among the groups endorsing Flynn were low-income tenant organizations, elderly organizations, and a number of labor unions.

In the election, both Flynn and King worked to build progressive coalitions, and both pledged to dedicate themselves to working across ethnic divides in the city. In the five weeks leading up to the general election, the two candidates held more than fifty local neighborhood debates.

The campaign was peaceful, and only a handful of isolated racial violence incidents occurred during it.

After his election, his mayoral transition effort was headed by John F. Bok.

==Mayoralty (1984–1993)==

Flynn served as mayor from his inauguration on January 2, 1984 until his resignation on July 12, 1993. During his tenure, Flynn was regarded to be a popular mayor, which was reflected in high approval ratings. In 1992, Fox Butterfield of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Flynn &quot;one of the most popular mayors in [Boston]&#x27;s history&quot;. As mayor, Flynn maintained a prominent public profile. In 1984, journalist Colman McCarthy described Flynn as having a &quot;blazonry of political zeal that makes him one of the nation&#x27;s most attractive Democrats.&quot;

In 1998, Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote that, as mayor, Flynn had, &quot;built a national reputation as an advocate for the homeless and a local reputation as a hands-on politician who showed up at every fire or police emergency.&quot;

At the time that Flynn was preparing to leave office, in an article published in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, George B. Merry described Flynn as a mayor whose &quot;hands-on&quot; approach had made him, &quot;one of the most visible mayors in Boston history.&quot; He considered Flynn&#x27;s leadership to have delivered mixed results. Merry described Flynn&#x27;s leadership-style as being heavily focused on neighborhood-level quality of life issues, writing, 

===General politics===
====Reelection campaigns====
Flynn was reelected mayor in 1987 and 1991, winning more than two-thirds of the vote each time. In his reelections, he won a higher vote share in Black and Hispanic areas of the city than he did in White areas.
In 1987, Flynn carried every ward of the city except for in his native South Boston. His failure to carry South Boston was perhaps due to his promise weeks before the election to desegregate all-white Boston Housing Authority developments in South Boston. At the time of his reelection, Flynn had attained an image of being un-corrupt, with political consultant Michael Goldman remarking at the time, &quot;The most important thing Flynn has done is to have been someone who could govern without corruption. Even those who are not satisfied with Flynn feel he has been honest.&quot; Goldman also noted that Flynn had also maintained an image of being a populist well-connected to the city&#x27;s blue-collar workers.

Flynn&#x27;s 1991 campaign for a third term came despite a 1981 campaign promise to only serve two terms. In his 1991 campaign, he ran a low-profile campaign that he touted as being &quot;grassroots&quot;, and ran no television or radio advertisements. He centered his candidacy on ties to the city&#x27;s neighborhoods and his successes in balancing the city&#x27;s budget.

====State, national, and international politics====
Flynn was an outspoken critic of the cuts that President Ronald Reagan championed making to federal revenue sharing, urban development grants, and housing and job assistance programs.

Flynn considered running in the 1990 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, but, due to police controversies, his struggling relationship with the minority community, and his anti-abortion stance, he ruled out a run.

Flynn became a national leader on urban matters. In 1987, as chair of the United States Conference of Mayors&#x27; Task Force on Hunger and Homelessness, Flynn advocated for the passage of the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Flynn served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors during 1991–92. In this role, Flynn challenged the theories of some pundits that cities were becoming economically obsolete due to the rise of &quot;edge city&quot; suburbanization, by arguing that &quot;as cities go, so goes America.&quot;

Flynn visited South Africa several times to see anti-apartheid figure Nelson Mandela when he was in prison. In June 1990, four months after Mandela&#x27;s release from prison, Flynn welcomed him to Boston on a trip Mandela took visiting many cities in the United States.

Ahead of the 1992 United States presidential election, there was some talk about whether Flynn could be a prospective vice presidential running mate on a Democratic ticket. In February 1992, Flynn unsuccessfully urged New York Governor Mario Cuomo to run in the presidential election. It took Flynn a while to grow warm to the Democratic Party&#x27;s ultimate presidential nominee, Bill Clinton. He endorsed Clinton in late June 1992. Flynn, a lifelong anti-abortion activist, played a role in drawing the anti-abortion (&quot;pro-life&quot;) Catholic vote to pro-abortion rights Bill Clinton in the general election. Flynn physically campaigned on Clinton&#x27;s behalf in roughly half of the nation&#x27;s states.

Despite opposition to gun control measures earlier in his political career, as mayor Flynn supported such policy, heavily campaigning in support of the passage of the Brady Bill.

In the late-1980s, Flynn partnered with community housing organizations to draft the federal Community Housing Partnership Act. This was then sponsored by Senator Frank Lautenberg and Congressman Joseph Kennedy, and received the endorsements of organizations such as the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, National Low-Income Housing Coalition. The bill was ultimately incorporated into the broader Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act, which was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush in October 1990. The act provided federal funding to community-based organizations to assist them in the construction and renovation of affordable housing.

===Economic matters===
====Community reinvestment agreement with banks====
In 1989, two studies, including one by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, found the city&#x27;s major banks to be discriminating in practices regarding mortgage lending, personnel hiring, and where they located their branches. In collaboration with community activists, Flynn raised a more than year-long campaign to pressure banks to change their practices. He also announced a plan to issue a regular city-sponsored &quot;report card&quot; on bank practices. He also adopted a &quot;linked deposit&quot; policy to have the city then withdraw funds from banks that received poor track records on these &quot;report cards&quot; to expand its deposits in banks which worked to meet the needs of the city&#x27;s neighborhoods. As a consequence, the banks reached a $400 million community reinvestment agreement with the city, in which the banks promised to open new branches, change lending and hiring practices, and to collaborate more closely with community development corporations and community groups.

====Fiscal matters====
When Flynn took office, the city had a $40 million deficit. Flynn was able to balance the city&#x27;s budget each year he was in office and improved the fiscal controls of the city. Flynn was able to improve the city&#x27;s bond rating each year he was in office. When he left office, the city had its highest bond rating in its history.

In his first term as mayor, Flynn dealt with a drastic cut in federal funds allocated to Boston. During the presidencies of Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Flynn often blamed shortcomings of the city government on their administrations for what he claimed were insufficient federal funds coming into the city&#x27;s coffers. Additionally, during the Massachusetts governorship of Republican Bill Weld, Flynn often faulted shortcomings of the city government on what he claimed was insufficient state funding, blaming Governor Weld but avoiding blaming the Democratic majorities in both chambers of the Massachusetts State Legislature.

During his mayoralty, Boston divested from corporations that invested in Northern Ireland and Apartheid South Africa.

=====Revenue package=====
To address the city&#x27;s deficit, upon taking office, Flynn worked to receive additional state aid and state legislature authorization to raise new local taxes. The state, at the time, viewed the city government as wasteful and inefficient. Flynn needed the help of the city&#x27;s business community to convince the state. Particularly the business community&#x27;s watchdog group, the Boston Municipal Research Bureau. In order to convince the business community that the Flynn administration was going to spend new revenues in a cost-effective manner, he recruited business community members to top positions in the municipal budget and treasury departments, and also created an advisory committee on management and budget operations that featured representatives from the business community. Flynn heeded the advice of this advisory committee, and &quot;opened the books&quot; on the city&#x27;s fiscal situation, something that his immediate predecessor, Kevin White, had refused to do himself. Ultimately, the Municipal Research Bureau gave its approval to Flynn&#x27;s revenue package and lobbied for it.

Flynn also met across the state with individuals and groups such as local officials, business groups, and trade unions in order to persuade them to lobby their own legislators to support the state legislation he was seeking. Flynn made the argument that Boston&#x27;s economic and fiscal health was critical to that of all of Massachusetts. He characterized Boston as being a generator of jobs and state sales tax revenue, as well as the home to institutions which benefited the entire state.

In 1984, the initial revenue package that Flynn championed was defeated in the state legislature. In 1985, Flynn proposed and lobbied for a revised revenue package. This revenue package passed, and was signed into law by Governor Dukakis.

====Labor matters====
Flynn created the &quot;Boston jobs&quot; program, requiring that developers that obtained city permits to hire Boston residents for half of all their construction jobs, minorities for one quarter of all their construction jobs, and women for one-tenth of all their construction jobs.

When Boston hotel owners and Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union Local 26 were in conflict, and looked headed towards a long and tense strike in 1985, Flynn had his police chief privately inform hotel owners that they could not expect to rely the Boston Police Department to protect strikebreakers or preserve order outside and within hotel establishments. This action of Flynn helped weaken the resolve of the hotel owners, who settled with Local 26, netting the union a significant victory.

When Flynn traveled to southwestern Virginia to support coal mining households during the Pittston Coal strike against the Pittston Coal Group, he learned from United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka that William Craig, a member of Pittston&#x27;s board, was also vice chairman of Shawmut Bank, the city of Boston&#x27;s second largest lender. Upon returning to the city, Flynn threatened that Boston would withdraw its deposits from the bank unless Craig resigned from the board of Pittston.

===Education and childcare===
In 1989, Flynn spearheaded the creation of a policy which requires that new commercial developments in the city&#x27;s downtown provide childcare services on-site or otherwise fund resources for off-site childcare spaces. However, the policy would, for decades, prove difficult to enforce due to the fact that the policy did not provide a clear definition of the amounts that developers needed to pay for off-site childcare spaces. This was addressed in 2022, when Mayor Michelle Wu signed an executive order outlining a formula to determine the amount of these payments.

In 1993, George B. Merry wrote that while Flynn had &quot;vastly upgraded&quot; the city&#x27;s public school system as mayor, at the time of Flynn&#x27;s departure from the mayoralty, the school district, &quot;appear[ed] to be facing an uncertain future.&quot;

In July 1991, Flynn won a fight to turn Boston School Committee from an elected school board to one whose members are appointed by the mayor. This change took effect in January 1992. Before this change, the elected school board had come to be regarded as fractious. As he approached his departure as mayor in 1993, Flynn questioned whether the change had been a good decision. He conceded that it had disenfranchised the input of voters in shaping the school board, and had upset many communities of color in the city. In 1993, little over a year since the appointed board had taken office, disorder had already arisen on the board, and Black organizers in the city were pushing to revert to an elected school board. In July 1993, Flynn remarked, 

Flynn also conceded that the appointed school board had failed in terms of accountability, remarking in 1993, 

In 1993, Flynn wrote an open letter to those seeking to run in the 1993 Boston mayoral election to succeed him which pronounced his regret for having changed the city&#x27;s school board to an appointed board, and which expressed his preference for reverting it back to an elected one. This was to no avail, and Boston remains the only municipality in Massachusetts without an elected school board.

===Public safety and law enforcement===
In 1985, Flynn appointed Francis Roache as the city&#x27;s police commissioner. Roache was a childhood friend of Flynn, and would be one of his closet associates during his mayoralty.

Flynn&#x27;s administration funded neighborhood watch groups.

In 1990, Flynn received strong criticism from Black leaders over the city police&#x27;s handling of the investigation into the murder of Carol Stuart, including the arrest and intensive search of William Bennett. Flynn had instructed for a citywide manhunt for murderer after the killing. Decades later, in 2023, then-mayor Michelle Wu apologized on behalf of the city for the impact that police conduct in the investigation Stuart&#x27;s murder had upon the African-American community in the city, especially in Mission Hill. Her apology was directly addressed to Bennett as well as Alan Swanson, both of whom she acknowledged had been wrongly treated as suspects.

In response to concerns over the police department (including those stemming from the investigation into Carol Stuart&#x27;s murder), in May 1991, Flynn empaneled the St. Clair Commission, headed by James D. St. Clair. In January 1992, the St. Clair Commission released its report, which was critical of the Boston Police Department for mismanagement, and urged against reappointing Commissioner Roache when his term expired that April. Flynn appointed William Bratton to serve as the city&#x27;s new police commissioner.

At the end of Flynn&#x27;s tenure, in 1993, George B. Merry observed that crime in the city remained &quot;a continuing problem&quot;.

===Racial relations===
Before Flynn took office, Boston had seen a very high level of racial tensions in the 1970s. Retrospectively, in 2023 Michael Jonas of &quot;Commonwealth&quot; magazine wrote that, as mayor, Flynn went &quot;to great lengths to promote racial harmony and heal divisions, not inflame them.&quot; In 1993, George B. Merry observed, 

Early into his mayoralty, Flynn signaled his support for racially integrating the city&#x27;s neighborhoods when he directly assisted a number of black households with moving into a public housing development located in a neighborhood with a majority white working-class population. During Flynn&#x27;s mayoralty, the City of Boston regained control over the Boston Housing Authority, which had previously been in court receivership. Weeks before the 1987 mayoral election, Flynn publicized a plan to desegregate all-white housing developments of the Boston Housing Authority located in South Boston. In 1988, the city of Boston reached a formal agreement with the federal government to integrate public housing in South Boston.

A 1987 poll published by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; found that the Boston residents were expressing increasingly optimistic outlooks on the state of race relations in the city. Many of the city&#x27;s politicians, while questioning whether the public was correct in such an assessment, expressed the belief that this sentiment was reflective of the public&#x27;s perception of Flynn&#x27;s leadership in regards to race relations.

===Urban development===

Flynn took office amid a period of urban flight by the city&#x27;s middle class. Peter Dreier would describe Flynn as having been elected &quot;with a populist mandate to &#x27;share the prosperity&#x27; of Boston&#x27;s downtown economic boom—particularly in terms of jobs and housing—with the city&#x27;s poor and working-class residents.&quot; Flynn had campaigned for office in his initial election on a housing-focused platform. When Flynn took office, downtown real estate developers were highly worried by his populist agenda. Flynn opted not to socialize with real estate developers, and refused to take political contributions from developers that had projects being considered by the city government.

When Flynn assumed office, the federal government was greatly decreasing federal funding for urban housing, job training, and economic development programs. Boston had been reliant on federal funding for these uses for the preceding quarter-century. Flynn looked to the private sector. He worked to use public-private partnerships as well as government regulatory tools of the private sector such as zoning and rent control. Flynn was successful in his fight to implement rent control laws in the city.

During Flynn&#x27;s mayoralty, the city had a strong development market, and he was regarded to be a &quot;pro-development&quot; mayor.

During Flynn&#x27;s mayoralty, major projects included the new Boston City Hospital complex. The city also created what was its first long-term capital plan for fixing its streets, infrastructure, school structures, and for creating new precinct stations and recreation centers. The city also significantly improved its parks and recreation centers.

Flynn focused on addressing the quality of life in neighborhoods, as well as on addressing gentrification.

The city built what was an unprecedented number of new units of affordable housing during Flynn&#x27;s mayoralty. Flynn&#x27;s administration successfully overcame the political forces of the city&#x27;s real estate industry to put in place a policy that doubled the linkage fee funds that downtown developers were required to provide to neighborhood housing funds. Over the course of his mayoralty, this fund received over $70 million, and helped in the city&#x27;s creation of over 8,000 units of affordable housing.

After a five-year campaign by Flynn and community activists, United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce agreed to hand over to community-based non profits and tenant organizations a total of 2,000 HUD-subsidized apartments located in roughly 70 buildings that had been abandoned by property owners. Additionally, Boston had success in addressing problems in troubled HUD public housing projects. Clinton&#x27;s HUD Secretary, Henry Cisneros, later decided to change HUD policy to replicate this.

Flynn successful fights to enact rent control laws and strong tenants&#x27; rights laws put him at odds with the landlord lobby. The Flynn administration also funded tenant groups, who organized against bad landlords. In 1986, Flynn worked successfully with tenant activists to get the Boston City Council to pass a ban on developers evicting tenants in order to clear apartment buildings for condominium conversions. In 1988, he worked to successfully get the City Council to empower the city&#x27;s rent board with regulatory powers over condo conversions and lodging houses. Flynn also got the City Council to put in place rent control on projects in the city subsidized by United States Department of Housing and Urban Development if the owners exercised the option to prepay their federally subsidized mortgages. These movies potentially protected thousands of subsidized units in the city from conversion to market-rate housing.

Flynn also championed inclusionary housing policies that would require developers of market-rate housing to provide units for moderate and low-income residents. In July 1986, Flynn presented the Boston Redevelopment Authority with a potential policy to require private developers to designate 10% of their housing units in projects with at least ten units for moderate and low-income residents. This push faced strong opposition.

Boston&#x27;s development director Steve Coyle oversaw the institution of controversial &quot;downzoning&quot; growth management safeguards aimed at combatting the &quot;Manhattanization&quot; of the city&#x27;s historic downtown and neighborhoods.

Flynn&#x27;s administration collaborated on development with nonprofit organizations. The Flynn administration provided neighborhood groups significant influence in planning and development decisions, as well as other matters. To do this he worked with neighborhood councils, zoning committees, and project-specific advisory groups. They worked with community development corporations to undertake the rehabilitation of thousands of housing units in the city. A very notable example of collaboration saw the city government delegate its own urban renewal powers (including eminent domain authority) to the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, a community group in the Roxbury neighborhood who are allowed to use that authority in parts of the neighborhood.

===Resignation and succession===
In 1993, Flynn resigned during his third term as mayor when he was appointed by Clinton to serve as United States Ambassador to the Holy See (the Vatican). Flynn was nominated in March 1993, and announced he would be resigning as mayor. However, in June, he reconsidered whether he would accept the role. He met with President Clinton and United States State Department officials to better define what his role would be as ambassador. The Senate unanimously confirmed his appointment that month, and he resigned as mayor on July 12, 1993.

Upon the announcement of Flynn&#x27;s nomination, it became anticipated that then-Boston City Council President Thomas Menino was, per the city charter, going to assume the office of &quot;acting mayor&quot; upon Flynn&#x27;s expected resignation. Flynn had had a longtime friendship with Menino. However, their relationship was noted to have become somewhat terser during the period in which Flynn was preparing to hand over the office to Menino. One cause for their rift was that, after Menino had promised he would appoint 100 new police officers when he took office, Flynn beat him to the chase and did so himself, which angered Menino.

When Flynn resigned on July 12, 1993, Menino became acting mayor. Menino would go on to win the 1993 Boston mayoral election, becoming mayor.

==Ambassador to the Holy See (1993–1997)==

Flynn served as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Holy See from September 2, 1993, through September 20, 1997. He was the first member of the Democratic Party to hold this post. He was appointed on July 1, 1993, and presented his credentials on September 2, 1993.

Clinton had Flynn expand the role of the post&#x27;s mission. Flynn not only represented the United States to the Holy See, but also represented the United States in imperiled areas around the world on matters of social justice and economic justice. Flynn helped lead relief efforts related to an earthquake in India, and was involved in humanitarian aid efforts to nations such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Haiti, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda. He was also involved in efforts to broker the Good Friday Agreement. He also collaborated with the Holy See on efforts to resolve problems in various areas of the world. He also played a key role in brokering an agreement to start a formal process to have Israel and the Holy See establish formal relations with each other. Flynn&#x27;s tenure was somewhat shaky, however. In 1998, Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; described his tenure as, &quot;unorthodox and controversial.&quot; Flynn twice received reprimands from the United States Department of State: in one instance for publicly discussing domestic American policy, and in the other instance for having an employee of the embassy manage Flynn&#x27;s family&#x27;s finances.

At the time he accepted the position of ambassador, Flynn made it known that he intended to eventually return to politics, likely running for another public office. While ambassador, Flynn considered running for governor of Massachusetts in 1994 to unseat incumbent Republican Bill Weld. However, Flynn announced in April 1994 that he would not run in the 1994 gubernatorial election.

During his time as ambassador, the campaign committee for Flynn&#x27;s mayoral candidacies was subject to federal and state investigation. In February 1996, Flynn plead to having misused campaign funds during his tenure as mayor and agreed to repay $12,500 in funds to his campaign committee. The state of Massachusetts&#x27; attorney general was considering bringing a civil lawsuit against Flynn regarding these funds. Douglas deRusha, the former bookkeeper for Flynn&#x27;s mayoral campaign committee, went to prison for embezzlement. Coincidentally, the same month that Flynn plead to having misused campaign funds, an unrelated investigation resulted in Flynn&#x27;s former top-aide during his mayoralty, Joseph Fisher, pleading guilty for having failed to report more than $51,000 that he had received as bribes and illegal favors during his seven years serving special assistant to Flynn during Flynn&#x27;s mayoralty. Both investigations generated negative publicity for Flynn.

In early 1997, eying leaving his post, Flynn made an effort to become a university athletic director, reaching out to Boston-area universities such as Northeastern University. His mayoral successor, Thomas Menino, attempted to help persuade Boston-area universities to hire Flynn for such a position. This effort was to no avail, however. Shortly thereafter, Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, who had already expressed interest in appointing Flynn to an unpaid position on a state commission, expressed interest in potentially offering Flynn a paid position in his gubernatorial administration. In early September 1997, Flynn shared his intent to run for governor of Massachusetts in 1998. Two weeks later, Flynn announced his intent to resign his post as ambassador. Flynn left his post on September 20, 1997.

On October 3, 1997, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; published an article which both accused Flynn of having been a sub-par diplomat as ambassador and of having had a longtime drinking problem. The article included a reporter&#x27;s claim to have, firsthand, witnessed Flynn walking around Boston while seemingly drunk while visiting the city on break from his ambassadorial duties on August 6, 1997. Flynn attributed the article to the paper&#x27;s opposition to his planned 1998 gubernatorial campaign and also to contempt for his &quot;class, religion and ethnic background.&quot; This article was seen as hurting Flynn&#x27;s public image. Flynn defended himself in an interviewed aired by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in April 1998.

==1998 congressional campaign==
Following his service as ambassador, Flynn considered running for governor of Massachusetts in 1998. Flynn made public in January 1998 his intent to later that year launch his candidacy. However, obstacles, such as a lack of financial campaign reserves and the political challenge of running for governor in the state of Massachusetts with a strong anti-abortion stance like his, dissuaded him. Another factor that made his candidacy challenging was the perceived difficulty of winning statewide with a political identity so strongly tied to the city of Boston. Flynn&#x27;s ambition of being elected governor was regarded as being a longshot.

Instead of running for governor, after Joseph P. Kennedy II announced his intent not to seek an additional congressional term, Flynn decided to run in the 1998 election for Massachusetts&#x27;s 8th congressional district seat that Kennedy would be vacating. Flynn formally announced his candidacy in June 1998. In September, Flynn lost in the Democratic primary election (the real contest in the heavily Democratic district) to Somerville Mayor Mike Capuano, who went on to win the general election. Flynn placed second with roughly 18% of the vote.

Flynn was the only anti-abortion candidate of the ten running in the primary, and his campaign advertising utilized photos of him with Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa. Flynn had run a quiet grassroots campaign operation. Flynn was endorsed by the local chapters of the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association and Iron Workers unions. Flynn had been regarded as an early front-runner in the primary, and private and public opinion polls had showed him to be leading. However, polls show that Capuano enjoyed a last-minute rise in support that resulted in his victory over Flynn.

Ceci Connolly of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; observed during the campaign, 

==Later career==

In 2001, for several weeks Flynn openly explored a possible run in that year&#x27;s special election to succeed Joe Moakley as the congressman from Massachusetts&#x27;s 9th congressional district. However, in mid-June 2001, Flynn ruled out such a run and threw his support behind a potential candidacy by State Senator Stephen Lynch, who ultimately ran and won the election.

While he has not run for office again himself, Flynn subsequently maintained some involvement in politics and related matters. In 2004, Flynn unsuccessfully pursued litigation to reverse the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling that had, earlier that year, legalized same-sex marriage in Massachusetts. During the general election campaign of the 2009 Boston mayoral election, Flynn and his one-time mayoral opponent Mel King both came together to endorse Michael Flaherty&#x27;s campaign against Thomas Menino. In the 2000 presidential election, Flynn and the Catholic Alliance organization that he headed endorsed the Republican of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. In 2010, Flynn again crossed party lines to vote for the successful candidacy of Republican nominee Scott Brown for the United States Senate. In 2012, Flynn appeared in television ads supporting Brown for reelection. He also voiced support for Mitt Romney, that year&#x27;s Republican nominee for president. He has also continued to comment on United States relations with the Holy See. In 2009, he responded critically to rumors that President Barack Obama might be considering Caroline Kennedy for Flynn&#x27;s former post as ambassador. He opined that Kennedy&#x27;s pro-choice abortion stance would make her unbefitting to serve as ambassador to the Holy See. In 2013, he criticized plans to relocate the Embassy of the United States to the Holy See to a building that would be adjacent to the Embassy of the United States to Italy.

Flynn involved himself in media after concluding his career in public office. In 1998, he had a role as a radio host on WRKO in Boston. In September 2014, he became a regular contributor to &quot;The Pilot&quot;, the official newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. In February 2017, Flynn became a columnist for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;.

In 1999, Flynn became president of Catholic Alliance, a nonpartisan Catholic advocacy group. In this role, while remaining a Democrat, he and the Catholic Alliance endorsed George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential election. Flynn also became president of another Catholic political advocacy organization, Your Catholic Voice. He later started Catholic Citizenship, serving as its national chairman. He cited the organization as arising from conversations he had with a figure in national Catholic activism that affirmed in Flynn the importance of his message relating to adhering to Catholic teachings above partisan political concerns. Beginning in 2004, he also served on the advisory board of Catholics for the Common Good, a lay apostolate for evangelization of culture.

In 2013, Flynn voiced his public agreement with the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council&#x27;s position in its lawsuit against a developer and the city. The neighborhood council was suing over what it contended was a wrongful grant of a zoning variance. The lawsuit was locally controversial. The case was dismissed by a judge over lack of standing, disputing the neighborhood council&#x27;s assertion that it could be considered a &quot;government body&quot;.

In 2024, Flynn endorsed Erin Murphy&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign in the Democratic primary for clerk of the Suffolk Supreme Judicial Court. This primary election was regarded to have served as a prominent proxy battle the city&#x27;s progressive politicians and its city&#x27;s more conservative &quot;old guard&quot;, with many prominent progressives endorsing the victorious Allison Cartwright and many of prominent practitioners of (more conservative) &quot;old-school&quot; Boston politics endorsing Murphy. The election was also described as being was also described as serving as a proxy battle between Mayor Michelle Wu&#x27;s allies and her critics: with Wu and several allies endorsing Cartwright, and several Wu critics endorsing Murphy.

==Personal life==
Flynn is married to Catherine (née Coyne), who often goes by &quot;Kathy&quot;. They have six children: Ray Jr., Edward, Julie, Nancy, Katie, and Maureen. In November 2017, son Edward M. Flynn was elected to the Boston City Council. Flynn has continued residing in South Boston.

While serving as mayor, Flynn played himself in the 1989 episode &quot;The Stork Brings A Crane&quot; of the Boston–set sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. In the episode, Flynn has his entourage take away Cliff Clavin, who writes to Flynn once a week.

Flynn was an avid runner who made headlines in 1984 when he ran in the Boston Marathon (with a finishing time of 4:23:54) and the New York City Marathon (finishing in 3:59:46).

In March 2007, Flynn was grand marshal of the 246th New York St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade.

In May 2007, Flynn joined the College of Fellows of the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology in Berkeley, California, who also awarded him the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters.

In September 2008, Flynn was hospitalized after he collapsed at a Boston-area speaking engagement. In March 2011, Flynn&#x27;s home was broken into; among the valuables taken were rosary beads blessed by Pope John Paul II and letters from influential world figures. In April 2021, Flynn was hospitalized and received a hip replacement surgery after suffering a fall. In December 2021, Flynn was hospitalized after again falling, this time having broken a bone in his neck.

==Political views==
During his political career, Flynn was regarded to be an &quot;economic liberal&quot; and &quot;cultural conservative&quot;. Over the course of his political career, Flynn&#x27;s positions on some matters remained consistent, while others evolved. Flynn has numerous times endorsed Republican candidates in closely contested elections, including George W. Bush in the 2000 president election, Scott Brown in 2010 and 2012 senate elections, and Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.

In his early political career, Flynn prominently opposed court-ordered school desegregation busing. Over the course of his political career, Flynn consistently opposed abortion. Despite having opposed gun control policies in his early political career as mayor Flynn supported them. While he opposed gay rights issues in his early political career, by the time of his first mayoral campaign made an active effort to ingratiate himself to the gay community. However, motivated by his continued opposition to same-sex marriage, shortly after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that in 2004 that same-sex marriage was a protected right in Massachusetts, Flynn attempted litigation to see their ruling overturned. Flynn opposed decreases initiated during the Reagan presidency to federal revenue sharing with cities. Elected mayor on a populist platform, Flynn supported wealth redistribution.

==Honors==
In February 2016, the Boston Marine Industrial Park was renamed the Raymond L. Flynn Marine Park. A nearby bridge was also renamed in Flynn&#x27;s honor. In May 2017, Governor of Massachusetts Charlie Baker dedicated Flynn Cruiseport Boston, located in the Port of Boston.

Flynn has received a number of civic awards. He has received the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith International Humanitarian Award, Martin Luther King Jr. Award, and Boys Club of America &quot;Man of the Year Award&quot;. In 2019, the business interest organization A Better City awarded Flynn a &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; award. Then-mayor Marty Walsh presented the award to Flynn at an awards ceremony. Walsh praised Flynn, declaring that Flynn had &quot;led at the national and international level, while always staying closely connected to the people in our working class neighborhoods. He&#x27;s always been a champion for everyday people: working men and women; kids and seniors; people with disabilities; and everyone who calls the city of Boston their home.&quot;

<doc id="577031" wikidata="Q610009" url="?curid=577031" title="Gary Cherone">
<text>Gary Francis Caine Cherone ( ; born July 26, 1961) is an American rock singer and songwriter. Cherone is known for his work as the lead vocalist of the Boston rock group Extreme and Van Halen.

== Early life ==
Cherone grew up in Malden, Massachusetts, and attended Malden High School. He is the third of five brothers and the younger fraternal twin of Greg Cherone.

In his teenage years, Cherone turned to singing in local bands and was heavily influenced by the reigning rock frontmen of the day, most notably Roger Daltrey of The Who, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, and Queen&#x27;s Freddie Mercury. In 1979 Cherone and drummer friend Paul Geary along with guitarist Matt McKay, formed a hard-rock band called Adrenalin, which performed locally. In 1981, they changed the band&#x27;s name to The Dream and recorded a six-song independent vinyl EP.

A few years later, Cherone and The Dream appeared in a music video produced by David Horgan, on the early MTV program, &quot;Basement Tapes&quot;, a show in which the viewing audience &quot;voted&quot; (via a toll-free telephone number) for one of two competing amateur music videos submitted by unsigned artists. The Dream&#x27;s video for &quot;Mutha, Don&#x27;t Wanna Go to School Today&quot;, won their contest, beating a then-unknown Henry Lee Summer by just 1% of the total vote.

== Career ==

=== With Extreme ===
In 1985, Cherone and Geary met guitarist Nuno Bettencourt and bassist Pat Badger in an altercation over a dressing room, but the rivals soon became collaborators and shortly after the combined foursome took the name &quot;Extreme&quot;, and began writing their own material. The name Extreme came from a play on the words &quot;Ex-Dream&quot;. By the late 1980s, the group had attracted a large regional following; in 1987, the band signed with A&amp;M Records, which released their self-titled debut album in 1989. Selling over 250,000 copies, the band&#x27;s debut album justified a second, and in 1990 the band recorded the critically acclaimed &quot;Extreme II: Pornograffiti&quot;, a mix of hard rock, funk, and pop propelled by Bettencourt&#x27;s guitar playing. The album&#x27;s lyrical content, mostly written by Cherone, was loosely based on the concept of a fictional young boy named &quot;Francis&quot; and his observations of a decadent, corrupt, and misogynistic society.

Although well received by the rock world in the press, initial sales and chart success for the album were sluggish until A&amp;M released the acoustic ballad &quot;More Than Words&quot; in the early spring of 1991. The song was picked up by mainstream radio and became a huge smash, reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that summer. &quot;Extreme II: Pornograffiti&quot; was eventually certified double platinum. Also in 1991, Extreme toured in support of David Lee Roth.

Cherone&#x27;s career came full circle in April 1992 when he performed &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; onstage with the three surviving members of Queen at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium. Extreme also performed a medley of Queen hits during the first half of the concert. Later that year, Extreme released &quot;III Sides To Every Story&quot;, a concept album.

Extreme&#x27;s 1995 recording,
&quot;Waiting for the Punchline,&quot; was a stripped-down affair that was only modestly successful. After the supporting tour, Bettencourt became dissatisfied and left the group to launch a solo career. &quot;Extreme&quot; officially folded soon afterward.

=== With Van Halen ===
In 1996, rock band Van Halen had a falling out with their second lead singer, Sammy Hagar, who had been with the band since 1985. After a failed reunion attempt with original lead vocalist David Lee Roth, who had been with Van Halen from 1974 to 1985, Van Halen was once again without a lead vocalist. At the urging of Van Halen&#x27;s manager, Ray Danniels (who also managed Extreme), Cherone was called for an audition. Guitarist Eddie Van Halen liked Cherone&#x27;s lyrics, as well as his work ethic, and in November 1996 Cherone became Van Halen&#x27;s third lead vocalist. That year, Cherone took up residence in Eddie&#x27;s guest house and spent the next year writing and recording a new studio album.

Released on March 17, 1998, &quot;Van Halen III&quot; debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, selling 197,000 copies in its first week then 500,000 by summer (RIAA gold certified in the United States) and over 700,000 copies as of 2011. The album featured an eclectic and diverse set of songs, marking a departure from the straightforward arena rock that Van Halen had played with Hagar and contrasting with the tongue-in-cheek bombast that originally attracted Van Halen fans to Roth. &quot;Van Halen III&quot;″s songs were often longer and more lyrically intricate than earlier Van Halen material, giving it a progressive influence. The album only produced a sole No. 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock hit in &quot;Without You&quot;.

By most band standards the album would be considered an unmitigated commercial success but by Van Halen&#x27;s standards it was considered a flop. Neither the album nor the supporting tour performed to financial expectations, and &quot;Van Halen III&quot; was the first album by the band to not achieve at least double platinum status. However, the tour was well received by fans. Cherone was afraid that he would be rejected by the Van Halen fan base and urged his bandmates to not limit the set list to songs recorded with their current lead vocalist, as they had done when Hagar joined the group. As a result, the tour included many songs that Van Halen had not played since Roth&#x27;s departure in 1984. Unlike the band&#x27;s 2004 and 2007–08 tours, Van Halen toured outside of North America in 1998, playing dates in Japan, Europe and for the first time, Australia and New Zealand. One date in Australia was filmed and aired on MTV.

Plans progressed for a follow-up album, rumoured to be called &quot;Love Again,&quot; to be released at the end of 1999. Releasing a new studio album only a year after the previous one had not been done by Van Halen since 1982, when the band released &quot;Diver Down&quot;. Reportedly, Van Halen&#x27;s then-record company Warner Bros. sent back the new album twice because they did not hear a &quot;hit&quot; pop single on it. Frustrated by the rejections from the record label, Cherone left Van Halen amicably. Since then, he has remained on good terms with his former bandmates, going on record numerous times with his thoughts about why the collaboration failed to work.

Years later, when reflecting on his time in the band, Cherone stated &quot;I was one of the three singers in the mighty Van Halen. You can&#x27;t take that away from me.&quot;

=== Post-Van Halen ===
After his departure from Van Halen, Cherone returned to Boston and put together a new project, Tribe of Judah. The band played several shows in the Boston area and released a CD on Spitfire Records entitled &quot;Exit Elvis&quot;.

He has on occasion guested with Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony during their &quot;The Other Half&quot; performances, and Nuno Bettencourt&#x27;s recent projects, as well as with the Boston Rock Opera.

In February 2003, just one week after The Station nightclub fire, Gary and his brother Markus performed &quot;More Than Words&quot; during a memorial service for the victims. The memorial was broadcast live on WHJY in Providence, RI.

In 2005, Cherone released a four-song sampler CD, &quot;Need I Say More&quot;, that was written and produced by Steve Catizone and Leo Mellace. This album was recorded by Jeff Yurek at Sanctum Sound in Boston, Massachusetts, and mixed by Carl Nappa in New York City. Musicians including Dave DiCenso (drums), Baron Browne (bass) and Steve Hunt (keyboards) are also featured on the record.

In May 2006, Cherone sang in three shows as part of Amazing Journey, a tribute to The Who created by ex-Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, featuring Paul Gilbert on guitar and Billy Sheehan on bass. Not long after, Gary and his brother Markus Cherone created their own tribute to The Who, Slip Kid. Presently the band continues to perform regularly in the Greater Boston area.

Later that year, Van Halen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Cherone&#x27;s three-year stint with the group did not establish him as a band member eligible for induction. However, at the televised induction ceremony, the group&#x27;s former bassist Michael Anthony thanked Cherone for his contributions.

=== Back to Extreme ===

Since 2004 Extreme have re-united with Cherone on several occasions for &quot;one off&quot; shows in their home town and in New England, but in November 2007 they announced plans to do another world tour along with a new album.

The album &quot;Saudades de Rock&quot; was released in August 2008.

In 2016, the band released Pornograffitti Live 25: Metal Meltdown, an audio/video presentation of its 2015 concert at Las Vegas&#x27; Hard Rock Casino.

In 2023, the band released their sixth studio album, called &quot;Six.&quot;

=== SlipKid ===
Cherone has toured with SlipKid, a tribute to The Who. Cherone&#x27;s former Extreme bandmate, Paul Mangone, is the bassist, and his brother, Markus Cherone, is the guitarist.

=== Hurtsmile ===
Cherone has formed a new band with his brother Markus on guitar, Joe Pessia on bass/mandolin and Dana Spellman on drums. They have released a self-titled debut album in early 2011 and have toured to promote it.

Their follow-up album, &quot;Retro Grenade&quot;, was released in 2014.

=== The Joe Perry Project ===
In 2022, Cherone was enlisted by Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry to sing in The Joe Perry Project, which led to shows performed that year and in 2023. Thus far, Cherone has not recorded with the band.

==Personal life==
Cherone is very private about his personal life. 

Cherone is pro-life and openly Christian. Cherone was raised Catholic. He covered the Kanye West song “God Is” for Easter Sunday in 2020. On March 5, 2014, he tweeted &quot;Atheism would seem a more plausible faith if it wasn&#x27;t for its first of many miraculous claims: something from nothing #Faitheism.&quot; In June 1999 and again in January 2001, Cherone famously wrote a pair of open letters to Eddie Vedder in response to the latter’s support for the pro-choice movement. Cherone discussed his June 1999 letter on &quot;The O’Reilly Factor&quot;.

<doc id="577035" wikidata="Q2505322" url="?curid=577035" title="Nondualism">
<text>Nondualism includes a number of philosophical and spiritual traditions that emphasize the absence of fundamental duality or separation in existence. This viewpoint questions the boundaries conventionally imposed between self and other, mind and body, observer and observed, and other dichotomies that shape our perception of reality. As a field of study, nondualism delves into the concept of nonduality and the state of nondual awareness, encompassing a diverse array of interpretations, not limited to a particular cultural or religious context; instead, nondualism emerges as a central teaching across various belief systems, inviting individuals to examine reality beyond the confines of dualistic thinking.

Nondualism emphasizes direct experience as a path to understanding. While intellectual comprehension has its place, nondualism emphasizes the transformative power of firsthand encounters with the underlying unity of existence. Through practices like meditation and self-inquiry, practitioners aim to bypass the limitations of conceptual understanding and directly apprehend the interconnectedness that transcends superficial distinctions. This experiential aspect of nondualism challenges the limitations of language and rational thought, aiming for a more immediate, intuitive form of knowledge.

Nondualism is distinct from monism, another philosophical concept that deals with the nature of reality. While both philosophies challenge the conventional understanding of dualism, they approach it differently. Nondualism emphasizes unity amid diversity. In contrast, monism posits that reality is ultimately grounded in a singular substance or principle, reducing the multiplicity of existence to a singular foundation. The distinction lies in their approach to the relationship between the many and the one.

Each nondual tradition presents unique interpretations of nonduality. Advaita Vedanta, a school of thought within Hindu philosophy, focuses on the realization of the unity between the individual self (Ātman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman). In Zen Buddhism, the emphasis is on the direct experience of interconnectedness that goes beyond conventional thought constructs. Dzogchen, found in Tibetan Buddhism, highlights the recognition of an innate nature free from dualistic limitations. Taoism embodies nondualism by emphasizing the harmony and interconnectedness of all phenomena, transcending dualistic distinctions, towards a pure state of awareness free of conceptualizations.

==Etymology==
&quot;Dual&quot; comes from Latin &quot;duo&quot;, two, prefixed with &quot;non-&quot; meaning &quot;not&quot;; &quot;non-dual&quot; means &quot;not-two&quot;. When referring to nonduality, Hinduism generally uses the Sanskrit term &quot;Advaita,&quot; while Buddhism uses &quot;Advaya&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;gNis-med,&quot; Chinese: &quot;pu-erh,&quot; Japanese: &quot;fu-ni&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Advaita&quot; (अद्वैत) is from Sanskrit roots &quot;a&quot;, not; &quot;dvaita&quot;, dual. As &quot;Advaita&quot;, it means &quot;not-two&quot;. or &quot;one without a second&quot;, and is usually translated as &quot;nondualism&quot;, &quot;nonduality&quot; and &quot;nondual&quot;. The term &quot;nondualism&quot; and the term &quot;advaita&quot; from which it originates are polyvalent terms.

&quot;Advaya&quot; (अद्वय) is also a Sanskrit word that means &quot;identity, unique, not two, without a second&quot;, and typically refers to the two truths doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, especially Madhyamaka.

The English term &quot;nondual&quot; was informed by early translations of the Upanishads in Western languages other than English from 1775. These terms have entered the English language from literal English renderings of &quot;advaita&quot; subsequent to the first wave of English translations of the Upanishads. These translations commenced with the work of Müller (1823–1900), in the monumental &quot;Sacred Books of the East&quot; (1879). He rendered &quot;advaita&quot; as &quot;Monism&quot;, as have many recent scholars. However, some scholars state that &quot;advaita&quot; is not really monism.

==Definitions==


Nonduality is a fuzzy concept, for which many definitions can be found. According to David Loy, since there are similar ideas and terms in a wide variety of spiritualities and religions, ancient and modern, no single definition for the English word &quot;nonduality&quot; can suffice, and perhaps it is best to speak of various &quot;nondualities&quot; or theories of nonduality. Loy sees non-dualism as a common thread in Taoism, Mahayana Buddhism, and Advaita Vedanta, and distinguishes &quot;Five Flavors Of Nonduality&quot;:
# Nondual awareness, the nondifference of subject and object, or nonduality between subject and object. It is the notion that the observer and the &#x27;things&#x27; observed cannot be strictly separated, but form, in the final analysis, a whole.
# The nonplurality of the world. Although the phenomenal world appears as a plurality of &quot;things&quot;, in reality they are &quot;of a single cloth&quot;.
# The negation of dualistic thinking in pairs of opposites. The yin-yang symbol of Taoism symbolises the transcendence of this dualistic way of thinking.
# The identity of phenomena and the Absolute, the &quot;nonduality of duality and nonduality&quot;, or the nonduality of relative and ultimate truth as found in Madhyamaka Buddhism and the two truths doctrine.
# &quot;Mysticism&quot;, a mystical unity between God and Human.

In his book &quot;Nonduality&quot;, which focuses on nondual awareness, Loy discusses three of them, namely thinking without dualistic concepts, the interconnectedness of everything that exists, and the non-difference of subject and object. According to Loy, &quot;all three claims are found in Mahaya Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, and Taoism, arguing that &quot;the nondual experience &#x27;behind&#x27; these contradictory systems is the same, and that the differences between them may be seen as due primarily to the nature of language.&quot;

===Nondual awareness===
According to Hanley, Nakamura and Garland, nondual awareness is central to contemplative wisdom traditions, &quot;a state of consciousness that rests in the background of all conscious experiencing – a background field of awareness that is unified, immutable, and empty of mental content, yet retains a quality of cognizant bliss [...] This field of awareness is thought to be ever present, yet typically unrecognized, obscured by discursive thought, emotion, and perception.&quot; According to Josipovic, &quot;consciousness-as-such is a non-conceptual nondual awareness, whose essential property is non-representational reflexivity. This property makes consciousness-as-such phenomenologically, cognitively and neurobiologically a unique kind, different from and irreducible to any contents, functions and states.&quot; It is the pure consciousness or witness-consciousness of the Purusha of Samkhya and the Atman of Advaita Vedanta, which is aware of prakriti, the entanglements of the muddled mind and cognitive apparatus.

== Origins ==

According to Signe Cohen, the notion of the highest truth lying beyond all dualistic constructs of reality finds its origins in ancient Indian philosophical thought. One of the earliest articulations of this concept is evident in the renowned Nasadiya (&quot;Non-Being&quot;) hymn of the Ṛigveda, which contemplates a primordial state of undifferentiated existence, devoid of both being and non-being.

The Mahāvākyas, as documented in the Upanishads, explain the unity of Brahman and Atman and form the basis of the Advaita Vedanta tradition. 

According to Cohen, several Upanishads, including the Īśā, imply a similar quest for an undifferentiated oneness as the ultimate objective of human spiritual pursuit. Ralph Griffith interprets the word &quot;Isha&quot; contextually, translates it as &quot;the Lord&quot;, and clarifies that this &quot;the Lord&quot; means &quot;the Self of All, and thy inmost Self – the only Absolute Reality&quot;.

==Hinduism==

===Vedanta===
Several schools of Vedanta are informed by Samkhya, the earliest Indian school of dualism, but teach a form of nondualism. The best-known is Advaita Vedanta, but other nondual Vedanta schools also have a significant influence and following, such as Vishishtadvaita Vedanta and Dvaitadvaita, both of which are bhedabheda.
&quot;Advaita&quot; refers to Atman-Brahman as the single universal existence beyond the plurality of the world, recognized as pure awareness or the witness-consciousness, as in Vedanta, Shaktism and Shaivism. Although the term is best known from the Advaita Vedanta school of Adi Shankara, &quot;advaita&quot; is used in treatises by numerous medieval era Indian scholars, as well as modern schools and teachers.

The Hindu concept of &quot;Advaita&quot; refers to the idea that all of the universe is one essential reality, and that all facets and aspects of the universe is ultimately an expression or appearance of that one reality. According to Dasgupta and Mohanta, non-dualism developed in various strands of Indian thought, both Vedic and Buddhist, from the Upanishadic period onward. The oldest traces of nondualism in Indian thought may be found in the Chandogya Upanishad, which pre-dates the earliest Buddhism. Pre-sectarian Buddhism may also have been responding to the teachings of the Chandogya Upanishad, rejecting some of its Atman-Brahman related metaphysics.

Advaita appears in different shades in various schools of Hinduism such as in Advaita Vedanta, Vishishtadvaita Vedanta (Vaishnavism), Suddhadvaita Vedanta (Vaishnavism), non-dual Shaivism and Shaktism. In the Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara, advaita implies that all of reality is one with Brahman, that the Atman (self) and Brahman (ultimate unchanging reality) are one. The advaita ideas of some Hindu traditions contrasts with the schools that defend dualism or Dvaita, such as that of Madhvacharya who stated that the experienced reality and God are two (dual) and distinct.

====Advaita Vedanta====

The nonduality of the Advaita Vedanta is of the identity of Brahman and the Atman. As in Samkhya, Atman is awareness, the witness-consciousness. Advaita has become a broad current in Indian culture and religions, influencing subsequent traditions like Kashmir Shaivism.

The oldest surviving manuscript on Advaita Vedanta is by Gauḍapāda (6th century CE), who has traditionally been regarded as the teacher of Govinda bhagavatpāda and the grandteacher of Adi Shankara. Advaita is best known from the Advaita Vedanta tradition of Adi Shankara (788-820 CE), who states that Brahman, the single unified eternal truth, is pure Being, Consciousness and Bliss (&quot;Sat-cit-ananda&quot;).

Advaita, states Murti, is the knowledge of Brahman and self-consciousness (Vijnana) without differences. The goal of Vedanta is to know the &quot;truly real&quot; and thus become one with it. According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the highest Reality, The universe, according to Advaita philosophy, does not simply come from Brahman, it &quot;is&quot; Brahman. Brahman is the single binding unity behind the diversity in all that exists in the universe. Brahman is also that which is the cause of all changes. Brahman is the &quot;creative principle which lies realized in the whole world&quot;.

The nondualism of Advaita, relies on the Hindu concept of Ātman which is a Sanskrit word that means &quot;essence&quot; or &quot;real self&quot; of the individual; it is also appropriated as &quot;soul&quot;. Ātman is the first principle, the &quot;true&quot; self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. Atman is the Universal Principle, one eternal undifferentiated self-luminous consciousness, asserts Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism.

Advaita Vedanta philosophy considers Atman as self-existent awareness, limitless, non-dual and same as Brahman. Advaita school asserts that there is &quot;soul, self&quot; within each living entity which is fully identical with Brahman. This identity holds that there is One Aawareness that connects and exists in all living beings, regardless of their shapes or forms, there is no distinction, no superior, no inferior, no separate devotee soul (Atman), no separate God soul (Brahman). The Oneness unifies all beings, there is the divine in every being, and all existence is a single Reality, state the Advaita Vedantins. The nondualism concept of Advaita Vedanta asserts that each soul is non-different from the infinite Brahman.

=====Three levels of reality=====
Advaita Vedanta adopts sublation as the criterion to postulate three levels of ontological reality:
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;paramartha&quot;, absolute), the Reality that is metaphysically true and ontologically accurate. It is the state of experiencing that &quot;which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved&quot;. This experience can&#x27;t be sublated (exceeded) by any other experience.
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;vyavahara&quot;), or &quot;samvriti-saya&quot;, consisting of the empirical or pragmatic reality. It is ever-changing over time, thus empirically true at a given time and context but not metaphysically true. It is &quot;our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake&quot;. It is the level in which both &quot;jiva&quot; (living creatures or individual souls) and &quot;Iswara&quot; are true; here, the material world is also true.
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;pratibhasika&quot;, apparent reality, unreality), &quot;reality based on imagination alone&quot;. It is the level of experience in which the mind constructs its own reality. A well-known example is the perception of a rope in the dark as being a snake.

=====Similarities and differences with Buddhism=====
Scholars state that Advaita Vedanta was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, given the common terminology and methodology and some common doctrines. Eliot Deutsch and Rohit Dalvi state:
Advaita Vedanta is related to Buddhist philosophy, which promotes ideas like the two truths doctrine and the doctrine that there is only consciousness (&quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;). It is possible that the Advaita philosopher Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhist ideas. Shankara harmonised Gaudapada&#x27;s ideas with the Upanishadic texts, and developed a very influential school of orthodox Hinduism.

The Buddhist term &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; is often used interchangeably with the term &quot;citta-mātra&quot;, but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is &quot;consciousness-only&quot; or &quot;mind-only&quot;. Advaita Vedanta has been called &quot;idealistic monism&quot; by scholars, but some disagree with this label. Another concept found in both Madhyamaka Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta is Ajativada (&quot;ajāta&quot;), which Gaudapada adopted from Nagarjuna&#x27;s philosophy. Gaudapada &quot;wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the &quot;Mandukaya Upanisad&quot;, which was further developed by Shankara.

Michael Comans states there is a fundamental difference between Buddhist thought and that of Gaudapada, in that Buddhism has as its philosophical basis the doctrine of Dependent Origination according to which &quot;everything is without an essential nature (&quot;nihsvabhāva&quot;), and everything is empty of essential nature (&quot;svabhava-shunya&quot;)&quot;, while Gaudapada does not rely on this principle at all. Gaudapada&#x27;s &quot;Ajativada&quot; is an outcome of reasoning applied to an unchanging nondual reality according to which &quot;there exists a Reality (&quot;sat&quot;) that is unborn (&quot;aja&quot;)&quot; that has essential nature (&quot;svabhava&quot;), and this is the &quot;eternal, fearless, undecaying Self (Atman) and Brahman&quot;. Thus, Gaudapada differs from Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna, states Comans, by accepting the premises and relying on the fundamental teaching of the Upanishads. Among other things, Vedanta school of Hinduism holds the premise, &quot;Atman exists, as self evident truth&quot;, a concept it uses in its theory of nondualism. Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, &quot;Atman does not exist (or, An-atman) as self evident&quot;.

Mahadevan suggests that Gaudapada adopted Buddhist terminology and adapted its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and adapted its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings. Dasgupta and Mohanta note that Buddhism and Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedanta are not opposing systems, but &quot;different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara&quot;.

====Vishishtadvaita Vedanta====

Vishishtadvaita Vedanta is another main school of Vedanta and teaches the nonduality of the qualified whole, in which Brahman alone exists, but is characterized by multiplicity. It can be described as &quot;qualified monism&quot;, or &quot;qualified non-dualism&quot;, or &quot;attributive monism&quot;.

According to this school, the world is real, yet underlying all the differences is an all-embracing unity, of which all &quot;things&quot; are an &quot;attribute&quot;. Ramanuja, the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy contends that the Prasthanatrayi (&quot;The three courses&quot;) – namely the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahma Sutras – are to be interpreted in a way that shows this unity in diversity, for any other way would violate their consistency.

Vedanta Desika defines &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; using the statement: &quot;Asesha Chit-Achit Prakaaram Brahmaikameva Tatvam&quot; – &quot;Brahman, as qualified by the sentient and insentient modes (or attributes), is the only reality.&quot;

==== Neo-Vedanta ====
Neo-Vedanta, also called &quot;neo-Hinduism&quot; is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and orientalism, and aims to present Hinduism as a &quot;homogenized ideal of Hinduism&quot; with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.

Unitarian Universalism had a strong impact on Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj, and subsequently on Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of Neo-Vedanta, a modern interpretation of Hinduism in line with western esoteric traditions, especially Transcendentalism, New Thought and Theosophy. His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India, and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West.

Narendranath Datta (Swami Vivekananda) became a member of a Freemasonry lodge &quot;at some point before 1884&quot; and of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore. Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833), the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians, who were closely connected to the Transcendentalists, who in turn were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on. It was in this cultic milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western esotericism. Debendranath Tagore brought this &quot;neo-Hinduism&quot; closer in line with western esotericism, a development which was furthered by Keshab Chandra Sen, who was also influenced by transcendentalism, which emphasised personal religious experience over mere reasoning and theology. Sen&#x27;s influence brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.

Vivekananda&#x27;s acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like Transcendentalism and New thought.

In 1897 he founded the Ramakrishna Mission, which was instrumental in the spread of Neo-Vedanta in the west, and attracted people like Alan Watts. Aldous Huxley, author of &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot;, was associated with another neo-Vedanta organisation, the Vedanta Society of Southern California, founded and headed by Swami Prabhavananda. Together with Gerald Heard, Christopher Isherwood, and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.

Neo-Vedanta, as represented by Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan, is indebted to Advaita vedanta, but also reflects Advaya-philosophy. A main influence on neo-Advaita was Ramakrishna, himself a bhakta and tantrika, and the guru of Vivekananda. According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of formlessness and form. Ramakrishna regarded the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive:

Radhakrishnan acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda&#x27;s neo-Advaita &quot;reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism&quot;:

Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara&#x27;s notion of &quot;maya&quot;. According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but &quot;a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real&quot;. According to Sarma, standing in the tradition of Nisargadatta Maharaj, Advaitavāda means &quot;spiritual non-dualism or absolutism&quot;, in which opposites are &quot;manifestations&quot; of the Absolute, which itself is immanent and transcendent:

Neo-Vedanta was well-received among Theosophists, Christian Science, and the New Thought movement; Christian Science in turn influenced the self-study teaching A Course in Miracles.

===Kashmir Shaivism===

Advaita is also a central concept in various schools of Shaivism, such as Kashmir Shaivism and Shiva Advaita which is generally known as Veerashaivism.

Kashmir Shaivism is a school of Śaivism, described by Abhinavagupta as &quot;paradvaita&quot;, meaning &quot;the supreme and absolute non-dualism&quot;. It is categorized by various scholars as monistic idealism (absolute idealism, theistic monism, realistic idealism, transcendental physicalism or concrete monism).

Kashmir Saivism is based on a strong monistic interpretation of the &quot;Bhairava Tantras&quot; and its subcategory the &quot;Kaula Tantras&quot;, which were tantras written by the Kapalikas. There was additionally a revelation of the &quot;Siva Sutras&quot; to Vasugupta. Kashmir Saivism claimed to supersede the dualistic Shaiva Siddhanta. Somananda, the first theologian of monistic Saivism, was the teacher of Utpaladeva, who was the grand-teacher of Abhinavagupta, who in turn was the teacher of Ksemaraja.

The philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism can be seen in contrast to Shankara&#x27;s Advaita. Advaita Vedanta holds that Brahman is inactive (&quot;niṣkriya&quot;) and the phenomenal world is a false appearance (&quot;māyā&quot;) of Brahman, like snake seen in semi-darkness is a false appearance of Rope lying there. In Kashmir Shavisim, all things are a manifestation of the Universal Consciousness, &quot;Chit&quot; or &quot;Brahman&quot;. Kashmir Shavisim sees the phenomenal world (&quot;Śakti&quot;) as real: it exists, and has its being in Consciousness (&quot;Chit&quot;).

Kashmir Shaivism was influenced by, and took over doctrines from, several orthodox and heterodox Indian religious and philosophical traditions. These include Vedanta, Samkhya, Patanjali Yoga and Nyayas, and various Buddhist schools, including Yogacara and Madhyamika, but also Tantra and the Nath-tradition.

===Contemporary Indian traditions===
Primal awareness is also part of other Indian traditions, which are less strongly, or not all, organised in monastic and institutional organisations. Although often called &quot;Advaita Vedanta&quot;, these traditions have their origins in vernacular movements and &quot;householder&quot; traditions, and have close ties to the Nath, Nayanars and Sant Mat traditions.

====Natha Sampradaya and Inchegeri Sampradaya====
The Natha Sampradaya, with Nath yogis such as Gorakhnath, introduced Sahaja, the concept of a spontaneous spirituality. According to Ken Wilber, this state reflects nonduality.

The Nath-tradition has been influential in the west through the &quot;Inchagiri Sampradaya&quot;, a lineage of Hindu Navnath and Lingayat teachers from Maharashtra which is well known due to the popularity of Nisargadatta Maharaj.

====Neo-Advaita====
Neo-Advaita is a new religious movement based on a modern Western interpretation of Advaita Vedanta, especially the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. According to Arthur Versluis, neo-Advaita is part of a larger religious current which he calls immediatism. Neo-Advaita has been criticized for this immediatism and its lack of preparatory practices. Notable neo-advaita teachers are H. W. L. Poonja and his students Gangaji, Andrew Cohen, and Eckhart Tolle.

==Buddhism==
There are different Buddhist views which resonate with the concepts and experiences of primordial awareness and non-duality or &quot;not two&quot; (&quot;advaya&quot;). The Buddha does not use the term &quot;advaya&quot; in the earliest Buddhist texts, but it does appear in some of the Mahayana sutras, such as the &quot;Vimalakīrti&quot;. The Buddha taught meditative inquiry (&quot;dhyana&quot;) and nondiscursive attention (&quot;samadhi&quot;), equivalents of which can be found in Upanishadic thought. He rejected the metaphysical doctrines of the Upanishads, particularly ideas which are often associated with Hindu nonduality, such as the doctrine that &quot;this cosmos is the self&quot; and &quot;everything is a Oneness&quot; (cf. SN 12.48 and MN 22). Because of this, Buddhist views of nonduality are particularly different from Hindu conceptions, which tend towards idealistic monism.

===Indian Buddhism===

====&quot;Nirvana&quot;, luminous mind, and Buddha-nature====

=====Nirvana=====
In archaic Buddhism, &quot;Nirvana&quot; may have been a kind of transformed and transcendent consciousness or discernment (&quot;viññana&quot;) that has &quot;stopped&quot; (&quot;nirodhena&quot;). According to Harvey this nirvanic consciousness is said to be &quot;objectless&quot;, &quot;infinite&quot; (&quot;anantam&quot;), &quot;unsupported&quot; (&quot;appatiṭṭhita&quot;) and &quot;non-manifestive&quot; (&quot;anidassana&quot;) as well as &quot;beyond time and spatial location&quot;.

Stanislaw Schayer, a Polish scholar, argued in the 1930s that the Nikayas preserve elements of an archaic form of Buddhism which is close to Brahmanical beliefs, and survived in the Mahayana tradition. Schayer&#x27;s view, possibly referring to texts where &quot;&#x27;consciousness&#x27; (&quot;vinnana&quot;) seems to be the ultimate reality or substratum&quot; as well as to luminous mind, saw nirvana as an immortal, deathless sphere, a transmundane reality or state. A similar view is also defended by C. Lindtner, who argues that in precanonical Buddhism nirvana is an actual existent. The original and early Buddhist concepts of nirvana may have been similar to those found in competing Śramaṇa (strivers/ascetics) traditions such as Jainism and Upanishadic Vedism. Similar ideas were proposed by Edward Conze and M. Falk, citing sources which speak of an eternal and &quot;invisible infinite consciousness, which shines everywhere&quot; as point to the view that nirvana is a kind of Absolute, and arguing that the nirvanic element, as an &quot;essence&quot; or pure consciousness, is immanent within samsara, an &quot;abode&quot; or &quot;place&quot; of prajña, which is gained by the enlightened.

In the Theravada tradition, &quot;nibbāna&quot; is regarded as an uncompounded or unconditioned (&quot;asankhata&quot;) dhamma (phenomenon, event) which is &quot;transmundane&quot;, and which is beyond our normal dualistic conceptions. In Theravada Abhidhamma texts like the &quot;Vibhanga,&quot; &quot;nibbana&quot; or the &quot;asankhata-dhatu&quot; (unconditioned element) is defined thus:

=====Luminous mind=====
Another influential concept in Indian Buddhism is the idea of luminous mind which became associated with Buddha-nature. In the Early Buddhist Texts there are various mentions of luminosity or radiance which refer to the development of the mind in meditation. In the &quot;Saṅgīti-sutta&quot; for example, it relates to the attainment of samadhi, where the perception of light (&quot;āloka sañña&quot;) leads to a mind endowed with luminescence (&quot;sappabhāsa&quot;). According to Analayo, the &quot;Upakkilesa-sutta&quot; and its parallels mention that the presence of defilements &quot;results in a loss of whatever inner light or luminescence (obhāsa) had been experienced during meditation&quot;. The Pali &quot;Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta&quot; uses the metaphor of refining gold to describe equanimity reached through meditation, which is said to be &quot;pure, bright, soft, workable, and luminous&quot;. The Pali Anguttara Nikaya (A.I.8-10) states: 
The term is given no direct doctrinal explanation in the Pali discourses, but later Buddhist schools explained it using various concepts developed by them. The Theravada school identifies the &quot;luminous mind&quot; with the &quot;bhavanga&quot;, a concept first proposed in the Theravāda Abhidhamma. The later schools of the Mahayana identify it with both the Mahayana concepts of &quot;bodhicitta&quot; and &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot;. The notion is of central importance in the philosophy and practice of Dzogchen.

=====Buddha-nature=====
Buddha nature or &quot;tathagata-garbha&quot; (literally &quot;Buddha womb&quot;) is that which allows sentient beings to become Buddhas. Various Mahayana texts such as the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha sūtras&quot; focus on this idea and over time it became a very influential doctrine in Indian Buddhism, as well in East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism. The Buddha nature teachings may be regarded as a form of nondualism. According to Sally B King, all beings are said to be or possess &quot;tathagata-garbha&quot;, which is nondual Thusness or Dharmakaya. This reality, states King, transcends the &quot;duality of self and not-self&quot;, the &quot;duality of form and emptiness&quot; and the &quot;two poles of being and non being&quot;.

There various interpretations and views on Buddha-nature and the concept became very influential in India, China and Tibet, where it also became a source of much debate. In later Indian Yogācāra, a new sub-school developed which adopted the doctrine of &quot;tathagata-garbha&quot; into the Yogācāra system. The influence of this hybrid school can be seen in texts like the &quot;Lankavatara Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Ratnagotravibhaga&quot;. This synthesis of Yogācāra tathagata-garbha became very influential in later Buddhist traditions, such as Indian Vajrayana, Chinese Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism.

====&quot;Advaya&quot;====
According to Kameshwar Nath Mishra, one connotation of &quot;advaya&quot; in Indic Sanskrit Buddhist texts is that it refers to the middle way between two opposite extremes (such as eternalism and annihilationism), and thus it is &quot;not two&quot;.
One of these Sanskrit Mahayana sutras, the &quot;Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra&quot; contains a chapter on the &quot;Dharma gate of non-duality&quot; (&quot;advaya dharma dvara pravesa&quot;) which is said to be entered once one understands how numerous pairs of opposite extremes are to be rejected as forms of grasping. These extremes which must be avoided in order to understand ultimate reality are described by various characters in the text, and include: Birth and extinction, &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;Mine&#x27;, Perception and non-perception, defilement and purity, good and not-good, created and uncreated, worldly and unworldly, samsara and nirvana, enlightenment and ignorance, form and emptiness and so on. The final character to attempt to describe ultimate reality is the bodhisattva Manjushri, who states:

It is in all beings wordless, speechless, shows no signs, is not possible of cognizance, and is above all questioning and answering. 

Vimalakīrti responds to this statement by maintaining completely silent, therefore expressing that the nature of ultimate reality is ineffable (&quot;anabhilāpyatva&quot;) and inconceivable (&quot;acintyatā&quot;), beyond verbal designation (&quot;prapañca&quot;) or thought constructs (&quot;vikalpa&quot;). The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;, a text associated with Yogācāra Buddhism, also uses the term &quot;advaya&quot; extensively.

In the Mahayana Buddhist philosophy of Madhyamaka, the two truths or ways of understanding reality, are said to be &quot;advaya&quot; (not two). As explained by the Indian philosopher Nagarjuna, there is a non-dual relationship, that is, there is no absolute separation, between conventional and ultimate truth, as well as between samsara and nirvana.

The concept of nonduality is also important in the other major Indian Mahayana tradition, the Yogacara school, where it is seen as the absence of duality between the perceiving subject (or &quot;grasper&quot;) and the object (or &quot;grasped&quot;). It is also seen as an explanation of emptiness and as an explanation of the content of the awakened mind which sees through the illusion of subject-object duality. However, in this conception of non-dualism, there are still a multiplicity of individual mind streams (&quot;citta santana&quot;) and thus Yogacara does not teach an idealistic monism.

These basic ideas have continued to influence Mahayana Buddhist doctrinal interpretations of Buddhist traditions such as Dzogchen, Mahamudra, Zen, Huayan and Tiantai as well as concepts such as Buddha-nature, luminous mind, Indra&#x27;s net, rigpa and shentong.

==== Madhyamaka ====

Madhyamaka, also known as &quot;Śūnyavāda&quot; (the emptiness teaching), refers primarily to a Mahāyāna Buddhist school of philosophy founded by Nāgārjuna. In Madhyamaka, &quot;Advaya&quot; refers to the fact that the two truths are not separate or different., as well as the non-dual relationship of s&quot;aṃsāra&quot; (the round of rebirth and suffering) and &quot;nirvāṇa&quot; (cessation of suffering, liberation). According to Murti, in Madhyamaka, &quot;Advaya&quot; is an epistemological theory, unlike the metaphysical view of Hindu Advaita. Madhyamaka advaya is closely related to the classical Buddhist understanding that all things are impermanent (&quot;anicca&quot;) and devoid of &quot;self&quot; (&quot;anatta&quot;) or &quot;essenceless&quot; (&quot;niḥsvabhāva&quot;), and that this emptiness does not constitute an &quot;absolute&quot; reality in itself.

In Madhyamaka, the two &quot;truths&quot; (&quot;satya&quot;) refer to conventional (&quot;saṃvṛti&quot;) and ultimate (&quot;paramārtha&quot;) truth. The ultimate truth is &quot;emptiness&quot;, or non-existence of inherently existing &quot;things&quot;, and the &quot;emptiness of emptiness&quot;: emptiness does not in itself constitute an absolute reality. Conventionally, &quot;things&quot; exist, but ultimately, they are &quot;empty&quot; of any existence on their own, as described in Nagarjuna&#x27;s magnum opus, the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; (MMK):

As Jay Garfield notes, for Nagarjuna, to understand the two truths as totally different from each other is to reify and confuse the purpose of this doctrine, since it would either destroy conventional realities such as the Buddha&#x27;s teachings and the empirical reality of the world (making Madhyamaka a form of nihilism) or deny the dependent origination of phenomena (by positing eternal essences). Thus the non-dual doctrine of the middle way lies beyond these two extremes.

&quot;Emptiness&quot; is a consequence of &quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot; (dependent arising), the teaching that no &quot;dharma&quot; (&quot;thing&quot;, &quot;phenomena&quot;) has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence on other &quot;dharmas&quot;. According to Madhyamaka all phenomena are empty of &quot;substance&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; () because they are dependently co-arisen. Likewise it is because they are dependently co-arisen that they have no intrinsic, independent reality of their own. Madhyamaka also rejects the existence of absolute realities or beings such as Brahman or Self. In the highest sense, &quot;ultimate reality&quot; is not an ontological Absolute reality that lies beneath an unreal world, nor is it the non-duality of a personal self (&quot;atman&quot;) and an absolute Self (cf. Purusha). Instead, it is the knowledge which is based on a deconstruction of such reifications and Conceptual proliferations. It also means that there is no &quot;transcendental ground&quot;, and that &quot;ultimate reality&quot; has no existence of its own, but is the negation of such a transcendental reality, and the impossibility of any statement on such an ultimately existing transcendental reality: it is no more than a fabrication of the mind.

However, according to Nagarjuna, even the very schema of ultimate and conventional, samsara and nirvana, is not a final reality, and he thus famously deconstructs even these teachings as being empty and not different from each other in the MMK where he writes:
According to Nancy McCagney, what this refers to is that the two truths depend on each other; without emptiness, conventional reality cannot work, and vice versa. It does not mean that samsara and nirvana are the same, or that they are one single thing, as in Advaita Vedanta, but rather that they are both empty, open, without limits, and merely exist for the conventional purpose of teaching the Buddha Dharma. Referring to this verse, Jay Garfield writes that:to distinguish between samsara and nirvana would be to suppose that each had a nature and that they were different natures. But each is empty, and so there can be no inherent difference. Moreover, since nirvana is by definition the cessation of delusion and of grasping and, hence, of the reification of self and other and of confusing imputed phenomena for inherently real phenomena, it is by definition the recognition of the ultimate nature of things. But if, as Nagarjuna argued in Chapter XXIV, this is simply to see conventional things as empty, not to see some separate emptiness behind them, then nirvana must be ontologically grounded in the conventional. To be in samsara is to see things as they appear to deluded consciousness and to interact with them accordingly. To be in nirvana, then, is to see those things as they are – as merely empty, dependent, impermanent, and nonsubstantial, not to be somewhere else, seeing something else.

However the actual Sanskrit term &quot;advaya&quot; does not appear in the MMK, and only appears in one single work by Nagarjuna, the &quot;Bodhicittavivarana&quot;.

The later Madhyamikas, states Yuichi Kajiyama, developed the &quot;Advaya&quot; definition as a means to &quot;Nirvikalpa-Samadhi&quot; by suggesting that &quot;things arise neither from their own selves nor from other things, and that when subject and object are unreal, the mind, being not different, cannot be true either; thereby one must abandon attachment to cognition of nonduality as well, and understand the lack of intrinsic nature of everything&quot;. Thus, the Buddhist nondualism or Advaya concept became a means to realizing absolute emptiness.

==== Yogācāra tradition ====


In the Mahayana tradition of Yogācāra (Skt; &quot;yoga practice&quot;), &quot;adyava&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;gnyis med&quot;) refers to overcoming the conceptual and perceptual dichotomies of cognizer and cognized, or subject and object. The concept of &quot;adyava&quot; in Yogācāra is an epistemological stance on the nature of experience and knowledge, as well as a phenomenological exposition of yogic cognitive transformation. Early Buddhism schools such as Sarvastivada and Sautrāntika, that thrived through the early centuries of the common era, postulated a dualism (&quot;dvaya)&quot; between the mental activity of grasping (&quot;grāhaka&quot;, &quot;cognition&quot;, &quot;subjectivity&quot;) and that which is grasped (&quot;grāhya&quot;, &quot;cognitum&quot;, intentional object). Yogacara postulates that this dualistic relationship is a false illusion or superimposition (&quot;samaropa&quot;).

Yogācāra also taught the doctrine which held that only mental cognitions really exist (&quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;), instead of the mind-body dualism of other Indian Buddhist schools. This is another sense in which reality can be said to be non-dual, because it is &quot;consciousness-only&quot;. There are several interpretations of this main theory, which has been widely translated as &quot;representation-only, ideation-only, impressions-only&quot; and &quot;perception-only.&quot; Some scholars see it as a kind of subjective or epistemic Idealism (similar to Kant&#x27;s theory) while others argue that it is closer to a kind of phenomenology or representationalism. According to Mark Siderits the main idea of this doctrine is that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions which manifest themselves as external objects, but &quot;there is actually no such thing outside the mind.&quot; For Alex Wayman, this doctrine means that &quot;the mind has only a report or representation of what the sense organ had sensed.&quot; Jay Garfield and Paul Williams both see the doctrine as a kind of Idealism in which only mentality exists.

However, even the idealistic interpretation of Yogācāra is not an absolute monistic idealism like Advaita Vedanta or Hegelianism, since in Yogācāra, even consciousness &quot;enjoys no transcendent status&quot; and is just a conventional reality. Indeed, according to Jonathan Gold, for Yogācāra, the ultimate truth is not consciousness, but an ineffable and inconceivable &quot;thusness&quot; or &quot;thatness&quot; (&quot;tathatā&quot;). Also, Yogācāra affirms the existence of individual mindstreams, and thus Kochumuttom also calls it a &quot;realistic pluralism&quot;.

The Yogācārins defined three basic modes by which we perceive our world. These are referred to in Yogācāra as the three natures (&quot;trisvabhāva&quot;) of experience. They are:
# &quot;Parikalpita&quot; (literally, &quot;fully conceptualized&quot;): &quot;imaginary nature&quot;, wherein things are incorrectly comprehended based on conceptual and linguistic construction, attachment and the subject object duality. It is thus equivalent to samsara. 
# &quot;Paratantra&quot; (literally, &quot;other dependent&quot;): &quot;dependent nature&quot;, by which the dependently originated nature of things, their causal relatedness or flow of conditionality. It is the basis which gets erroneously conceptualized, 
# &quot;Pariniṣpanna&quot; (literally, &quot;fully accomplished&quot;): &quot;absolute nature&quot;, through which one comprehends things as they are in themselves, that is, empty of subject-object and thus is a type of non-dual cognition. This experience of &quot;thatness&quot; (&quot;tathatā&quot;) is uninfluenced by any conceptualization at all.

To move from the duality of the &quot;Parikalpita&quot; to the non-dual consciousness of the &quot;Pariniṣpanna,&quot; Yogācāra teaches that there must be a transformation of consciousness, which is called the &quot;revolution of the basis&quot; (&quot;parāvṛtty-āśraya).&quot; According to Dan Lusthaus, this transformation which characterizes awakening is a &quot;radical psycho-cognitive change&quot; and a removal of false &quot;interpretive projections&quot; on reality (such as ideas of a self, external objects, etc.).

The &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra,&quot; a Yogācāra text, also associates this transformation with the concept of non-abiding nirvana and the non-duality of samsara and nirvana. Regarding this state of Buddhahood, it states:

Its operation is nondual (&quot;advaya vrtti&quot;) because of its abiding neither in samsara nor in nirvana (&quot;samsaranirvana-apratisthitatvat&quot;), through its being both conditioned and unconditioned (&quot;samskrta-asamskrtatvena&quot;).

This refers to the Yogācāra teaching that even though a Buddha has entered nirvana, they do no &quot;abide&quot; in some quiescent state separate from the world but continue to give rise to extensive activity on behalf of others. This is also called the non-duality between the compounded (&quot;samskrta&quot;, referring to samsaric existence) and the uncompounded (&quot;asamskrta&quot;, referring to nirvana). It is also described as a &quot;not turning back&quot; from both samsara and nirvana.

For the later thinker Dignaga, non-dual knowledge or &quot;advayajñāna&quot; is also a synonym for &quot;prajñaparamita&quot; (transcendent wisdom) which liberates one from samsara.

====Tantric Buddhism====
Buddhist Tantra, also known as Vajrayana, Mantrayana or Esoteric Buddhism, drew upon all these previous Indian Buddhist ideas and nondual philosophies to develop innovative new traditions of Buddhist practice and new religious texts called the Buddhist tantras (from the 6th century onwards). Tantric Buddhism was influential in China and is the main form of Buddhism in the Himalayan regions, especially Tibetan Buddhism. 

The concept of &quot;advaya&quot; has various meanings in Buddhist Tantra. According to Tantric commentator Lilavajra, Buddhist Tantra&#x27;s &quot;utmost secret and aim&quot; is Buddha nature. This is seen as a &quot;non-dual, self-originated Wisdom (jnana), an effortless fount of good qualities&quot;. In Buddhist Tantra, there is no strict separation between the sacred (nirvana) and the profane (samsara), and all beings are seen as containing an immanent seed of awakening or Buddhahood. The Buddhist Tantras also teach that there is a non-dual relationship between emptiness and compassion (&quot;karuna&quot;), this unity is called bodhicitta. They also teach a &quot;nondual pristine wisdom of bliss and emptiness&quot;. Advaya is also said to be the co-existence of Prajña (wisdom) and Upaya (skill in means). These nondualities are also related to the idea of &quot;yuganaddha&quot;, or &quot;union&quot; in the Tantras. This is said to be the &quot;indivisible merging of innate great bliss (the means) and clear light (emptiness)&quot; as well as the merging of relative and ultimate truths and the knower and the known, during Tantric practice.

Buddhist Tantras also promote certain practices which are antinomian, such as sexual rites or the consumption of disgusting or repulsive substances (the &quot;five ambrosias&quot;, feces, urine, blood, semen, and marrow.). These are said to allow one to cultivate nondual perception of the pure and impure (and similar conceptual dualities) and thus it allows one to prove one&#x27;s attainment of nondual gnosis (&quot;advaya jñana&quot;).

Indian Buddhist Tantra also views humans as a microcosmos which mirrors the macrocosmos. Its aim is to gain access to the awakened energy or consciousness of Buddhahood, which is nondual, through various practices.

===East-Asian Buddhism===

====Chinese====
 
Chinese Buddhism was influenced by the philosophical strains of Indian Buddhist nondualism such as the Madhymaka doctrines of emptiness and the two truths as well as Yogacara and &quot;tathagata-garbha&quot;. For example, Chinese Madhyamaka philosophers like Jizang, discussed the nonduality of the two truths. Chinese Yogacara also upheld the Indian Yogacara views on nondualism. One influential text in Chinese Buddhism which synthesizes &quot;Tathagata-garbha&quot; and Yogacara views is the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana, which may be a Chinese composition.

In Chinese Buddhism, the polarity of absolute and relative realities is also expressed as &quot;essence-function&quot;. This was a result of an ontological interpretation of the two truths as well as influences from native Taoist and Confucian metaphysics. In this theory, the absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can&#x27;t be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other. This interpretation of the two truths as two ontological realities would go on to influence later forms of East Asian metaphysics.

As Chinese Buddhism continued to develop in new innovative directions, it gave rise to new traditions like Tiantai and Chan (Zen), which also upheld their own unique teachings on non-duality.

The Tiantai school for example, taught a threefold truth, instead of the classic &quot;two truths&quot; of Indian Madhyamaka. Its &quot;third truth&quot; was seen as the nondual union of the two truths which transcends both. Tiantai metaphysics is an immanent holism, which sees every phenomenon, moment or event as conditioned and manifested by the whole of reality. Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all &quot;inherently entailed&quot; within each other. Each moment of consciousness is simply the Absolute itself, infinitely immanent and self reflecting.

Two doctrines of the Huayan school (Flower Garland), which flourished in China during the Tang period, are considered nondual by some scholars. King writes that the Fourfold Dharmadhatu and the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;) or &quot;perfect interfusion&quot; (&quot;yuanrong&quot;, 圓融) are classic nondual doctrines. This can be described as the idea that all phenomena &quot;are representations of the wisdom of Buddha without exception&quot; and that &quot;they exist in a state of mutual dependence, interfusion and balance without any contradiction or conflict.&quot; According to this theory, any phenomenon exists only as part of the total nexus of reality, its existence depends on the total network of all other things, which are all equally connected to each other and contained in each other. Another Huayan metaphor used to express this view, called Indra&#x27;s net, is also considered nondual by some.

====Zen====


The Buddha-nature and Yogacara philosophies have had a strong influence on Chán and Zen. The teachings of Zen are expressed by a set of polarities: Buddha-nature – sunyata; absolute-relative; sudden and gradual enlightenment.

The Lankavatara-sutra, a popular sutra in Zen, endorses the Buddha-nature and emphasizes purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra, another popular sutra, emphasizes sunyata, which &quot;must be realized totally or not at all&quot;. The Prajnaparamita Sutras emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the Heart Sutra says. According to Chinul, Zen points not to mere emptiness, but to &quot;suchness&quot; or the dharmadhatu.

The idea that the ultimate reality is present in the daily world of relative reality fitted into the Chinese culture which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not explain how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as the Five Ranks of Tozan and the Oxherding Pictures.

The continuous pondering of the break-through kōan (&quot;shokan&quot;) or Hua Tou, &quot;word head&quot;, leads to kensho, an initial insight into &quot;seeing the (Buddha-)nature&quot;. According to Victor Sogen Hori, a central theme of many koans is the &quot;identity of opposites&quot;, and point to the original nonduality. Hori describes kensho, when attained through koan-study, as the absence of subject–object duality. The aim of the so-called break-through koan is to see the &quot;nonduality of subject and object&quot;, in which &quot;subject and object are no longer separate and distinct&quot;.

Zen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life, to fully manifest the nonduality of absolute and relative. To deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by Linji Yixuan in his Three Mysterious Gates, the Four Ways of Knowing of Hakuin, the Five Ranks, and the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures which detail the steps on the Path.

====Korean====

The polarity of absolute and relative is also expressed as &quot;essence-function&quot;. The absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can&#x27;t be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other. The distinction does not &quot;exclude any other frameworks such as &quot;neng-so&quot; or &#x27;subject-object&#x27; constructions&quot;, though the two &quot;are completely different from each other in terms of their way of thinking&quot;. In Korean Buddhism, essence-function is also expressed as &quot;body&quot; and &quot;the body&#x27;s functions&quot;. A metaphor for essence-function is &quot;a lamp and its light&quot;, a phrase from the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot;, where Essence is lamp and Function is light.

===Tibetan Buddhism===
====Adyava: Gelugpa school Prasangika Madhyamaka====
The Gelugpa school, following Tsongkhapa, adheres to the adyava Prasaṅgika Mādhyamaka view, which states that all phenomena are sunyata, empty of self-nature, and that this &quot;emptiness&quot; is itself only a qualification, not a concretely existing &quot;absolute&quot; reality.

====Shentong====
In Tibetan Buddhism, the essentialist position is represented by &quot;shentong&quot;, while the nominalist, or non-essentialist position, is represented by &quot;rangtong&quot;.

Shentong is a philosophical sub-school found in Tibetan Buddhism. Its adherents generally hold that the nature of mind (&quot;svasaṃvedana&quot;), the substratum of the mindstream, is &quot;empty&quot; () of &quot;other&quot; (), i.e., empty of all qualities other than an inherently existing, ineffable nature. Shentong has often been incorrectly associated with the Cittamātra (Yogacara) position, but is in fact also Madhyamaka, and is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the Jonang school, although it is also taught by the Sakya and Kagyu schools. According to Shentongpa (proponents of shentong), the emptiness of ultimate reality should not be characterized in the same way as the emptiness of apparent phenomena because it is &quot;prabhāśvara-saṃtāna&quot;, or &quot;luminous mindstream&quot; endowed with limitless Buddha qualities. It is empty of all that is false, not empty of the limitless Buddha qualities that are its innate nature.

The contrasting Prasaṅgika view that all phenomena are sunyata, empty of self-nature, and that this &quot;emptiness&quot; is not a concretely existing &quot;absolute&quot; reality, is labeled rangtong, &quot;empty of self-nature&quot;.

The shentong-view is related to the Ratnagotravibhāga sutra and the Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of Śāntarakṣita. The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the empty nature of mind. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind.

====Dzogchen====

Dzogchen is concerned with the &quot;natural state&quot; and emphasizes direct experience. The state of nondual awareness is called &quot;rigpa&quot;. This primordial nature is clear light, unproduced and unchanging, free from all defilements. Through meditation, the Dzogchen practitioner experiences that thoughts have no substance. Mental phenomena arise and fall in the mind, but fundamentally they are empty. The practitioner then considers where the mind itself resides. Through careful examination one realizes that the mind is emptiness.

Karma Lingpa (1326–1386) revealed &quot;Self-Liberation through seeing with naked awareness&quot; (&quot;rigpa ngo-sprod&quot;,) which is attributed to Padmasambhava. The text gives an introduction, or pointing-out instruction (&quot;ngo-spro&quot;), into rigpa, the state of presence and awareness. In this text, Karma Lingpa writes the following regarding the unity of various terms for nonduality:
=====Garab Dorje&#x27;s three statements=====

Garab Dorje (c. 665) epitomized the Dzogchen teaching in three principles, known as &quot;Striking the Vital Point in Three Statements&quot; (&quot;Tsik Sum Né Dek&quot;), said to be his last words. These three statements are believed to convey the heart of his teachings and serve as a concise and profound encapsulation of Dzogchen&#x27;s view, its practice of contemplation, and the role of conduct. They give in short the development a student has to undergo:

Garab Dorje&#x27;s three statements were integrated into the &quot;Nyingthig&quot; traditions, the most popular of which in the &quot;Longchen Nyingthig&quot; by Jigme Lingpa (1730–1798). The statements are:

# Introducing directly the face of rigpa itself (&quot;ngo rang tok tu tré&quot;). Dudjom Rinpoche states this refers to: &quot;Introducing directly the face of the naked mind as the rigpa itself, the innate primordial wisdom.&quot;
# Deciding upon one thing and one thing only (&quot;tak chik tok tu ché&quot;). Dudjom states: &quot;Because all phenomena, whatever manifests, whether saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, are none other than the rigpa’s own play, there is complete and direct decision that there is nothing other than the abiding of the continual flow of rigpa.&quot;
# Confidence directly in the liberation of rising thoughts (&quot;deng drol tok tu cha&quot;). Dudjom comments: &quot;In the recognition of &quot;namtok&quot; [arising thoughts], whatever arises, whether gross or subtle, there is direct confidence in the simultaneity of the arising and dissolution in the expanse of dharmakāya, which is the unity of rigpa and &quot;śūnyatā&quot;.&quot;

==Other eastern religions==

===Sikhism===
Many newer, contemporary Sikhs have suggested that human souls and the monotheistic God are two different realities (dualism), distinguishing it from the monistic and various shades of nondualistic philosophies of other Indian religions. However, some Sikh scholars have attempted to explore nondualism exegesis of Sikh scriptures, such as during the neocolonial reformist movement by Bhai Vir Singh. According to Mandair, Singh interprets the Sikh scriptures as teaching nonduality. Sikh scholar Bhai Mani Singh is quoted as saying that Sikhism has all the essence of Vedanta philosophy. Historically, the Sikh symbol of Ik Oankaar has had a monistic meaning, and has been reduced to simply meaning, &quot;There is but One God&quot;, which is incorrect. Older exegesis of Sikh scripture, such as the Faridkot Teeka, has always described Sikh metaphysics as a non-dual, panentheistic universe.

===Taoism===

Taoism&#x27;s &quot;wu wei&quot; (Chinese &quot;wu&quot;, not; &quot;wei&quot;, doing) is a term with various translations and interpretations designed to distinguish it from passivity. Commonly understood as &quot;effortless action&quot;, this concept intersects with the core notions of nondualism. &quot;Wu wei&quot; encourages individuals to flow with the natural rhythms of existence, moving beyond dualistic perspectives and embracing a harmonious unity with the universe. This holistic approach to life, characterized by spontaneous and unforced action, aligns with the essence of nondualism, emphasizing interconnectedness, oneness, and the dissolution of dualistic boundaries. By seamlessly integrating effortless action in both physical deeds and mental states, &quot;wu wei&quot; embodies the nondual philosophy&#x27;s essence.

The concept of Yin and Yang, often mistakenly conceived of as a symbol of dualism, is actually meant to convey the notion that all apparent opposites are complementary parts of a non-dual whole.

==Western traditions==
A modern strand of thought sees &quot;nondual consciousness&quot; as a universal psychological state, which is a common stratum and of the same essence in different spiritual traditions. It is derived from Neo-Vedanta and neo-Advaita, but has historical roots in neo-Platonism, Western esotericism, and Perennialism. The idea of nondual consciousness as &quot;the central essence&quot; is a universalistic and perennialist idea, which is part of a modern mutual exchange and synthesis of ideas between western spiritual and esoteric traditions and Asian religious revival and reform movements.

Central elements in the western traditions are Neo-Platonism, which had a strong influence on Christian contemplation or mysticism, and its accompanying apophatic theology.

===Medieval Abrahamic religions===

====Christian contemplation and mysticism====

In Christian mysticism, contemplative prayer and Apophatic theology are central elements. In contemplative prayer, the mind is focused by constant repetition a phrase or word. Saint John Cassian recommended use of the phrase &quot;O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me&quot;. Another formula for repetition is the name of Jesus or the Jesus Prayer, which has been called &quot;the mantra of the Orthodox Church&quot;, although the term &quot;Jesus Prayer&quot; is not found in the Fathers of the Church. The author of &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; recommended use of a monosyllabic word, such as &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Love&quot;.

Apophatic theology is derived from Neo-Platonism via Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. In this approach, the notion of God is stripped from all positive qualifications, leaving a &quot;darkness&quot; or &quot;unground&quot;, it had a strong influence on western mysticism. A notable example is Meister Eckhart, who also attracted attention from Zen-Buddhists like D.T. Suzuki in modern times, due to the similarities between Buddhist thought and Neo-Platonism.

&quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; – an anonymous work of Christian mysticism written in Middle English in the latter half of the 14th century – advocates a mystic relationship with God. The text describes a spiritual union with God through the heart. The author of the text advocates centering prayer, a form of inner silence. According to the text, God can not be known through knowledge or from intellection. It is only by emptying the mind of all created images and thoughts that we can arrive to experience God. Continuing on this line of thought, God is completely unknowable by the mind. God is not known through the intellect but through intense contemplation, motivated by love, and stripped of all thought.

Thomism, though not non-dual in the ordinary sense, considers the unity of God so absolute that even the duality of subject and predicate, to describe him, can be true only by analogy. In Thomist thought, even the Tetragrammaton is only an approximate name, since &quot;I am&quot; involves a predicate whose own essence is its subject.

The former nun and contemplative Bernadette Roberts is considered a nondualist by Jerry Katz.

Hypostatic-union is an incomplete form of non-duality applied to a tertiary entity, neglecting the subjective self.

====Jewish Hasidism and Kabbalism====
According to Jay Michaelson, nonduality begins to appear in the medieval Jewish textual tradition which peaked in Hasidism:
One of the most striking contributions of the Kabbalah, which became a central idea in Chasidic thought, was a highly innovative reading of the monotheistic idea. The belief in one God is no longer perceived as the mere rejection of other deities or intermediaries, but a denial of any existence outside of God.

===Western philosophy===
Baruch Spinoza&#x27;s formulation of pantheism in the 17th century constitutes a seminal European manifestation of nondualism. His philosophical work, especially expounded in &quot;Ethics&quot; posits a radical idea that fuses divinity with the material world, suggesting that God and the universe are not separate entities but different facets of a single underlying substance. In his worldview, the finite and the infinite are harmoniously interwoven, challenging René Descartes&#x27; dualistic perspective.

One of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophical insights also resonates with nondualism. Nietzsche wrote that &quot;We cease to think when we refuse to do so under the constraint of language.&quot; This idea is explored in his book &quot;On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense&quot;. His scrutiny of conventional thought and language urges a departure from linguistic boundaries. This perspective aligns with the nondual notion of transcending dualistic concepts and engaging with reality in a more immediate, intuitive manner.

==Nondual consciousness as common essence==

According to the common-core thesis, different descriptions can mask quite similar if not identical experiences: An influential contemporary proponent of Perennialism was Aldous Huxley, who was influenced by Vivekananda&#x27;s Neo-Vedanta and Universalism, and popularized the notion of a common mystical core in his book &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot;.

Elias Amidon describes this common core as an &quot;indescribable, but definitely recognizable, reality that is the ground of all being&quot;. According to Amidon, this reality is signified by &quot;many names&quot; from &quot;spiritual traditions throughout the world&quot;:

According to Renard, these names are based on an experience or intuition of &quot;the Real&quot;. According to Renard, nondualism as common essence prefers the term &quot;nondualism&quot;, instead of monism, because this understanding is &quot;nonconceptual&quot;, &quot;not graspapable in an idea&quot;. Even to call this &quot;ground of reality&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, or &quot;Oneness&quot; is attributing a characteristic to that ground of reality. The only thing that can be said is that it is &quot;not two&quot; or &quot;non-dual&quot;: According to Renard, Alan Watts has been one of the main contributors to the popularisation of the non-monistic understanding of &quot;nondualism&quot;.

===Orientalism===
The western world has been exposed to Indian religions since the late 18th century. The first western translation of a Sanskrit text was made in 1785. It marked a growing interest in Indian culture and languages. The first translation of the dualism and nondualism discussing Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802 and influenced Arthur Schopenhauer, who called them &quot;the consolation of my life&quot;. Early translations also appeared in other European languages.

==Scholarly debates==

=== Religious experience ===

According to Victor Sogen Hori, the study of religious experience can be traced back to William James, who first used the term &quot;religious experience&quot; in his book, &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;. The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.

In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While Kant held that moral experience justified religious beliefs, John Wesley in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the Methodist movement (paralleling the Romantic Movement) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.

Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; was used by Schleiermacher and Albert Ritschl to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies religious beliefs.

Such religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was – during the period in-between world wars – famously rejected by Karl Barth. In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this liberal theological view are Charles Raven and the Oxford physicist/theologian Charles Coulson.

The notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.

===Rejection of the common core thesis===

The &quot;common-core thesis&quot; is criticised by &quot;diversity theorists&quot; such as S.T Katz and W. Proudfoot. They argue that

The idea of a common essence has been questioned by Yandell, who discerns various &quot;religious experiences&quot; and their corresponding doctrinal settings, which differ in structure and phenomenological content, and in the &quot;evidential value&quot; they present. Yandell discerns five sorts:
# Numinous experiences – Monotheism (Jewish, Christian, Vedantic)
# Nirvanic experiences – Buddhism, &quot;according to which one sees that the self is but a bundle of fleeting states&quot;
# Kevala experiences – Jainism, &quot;according to which one sees the self as an indestructible subject of experience&quot;
# Moksha experiences – Hinduism, Brahman &quot;either as a cosmic person, or, quite differently, as qualityless&quot;
# Nature mystical experience

The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may determine what &quot;experience&quot; someone has, which means that this &quot;experience&quot; is not the &quot;proof&quot; of the teaching, but a &quot;result&quot; of the teaching. The notion of what exactly constitutes &quot;liberating insight&quot; varies between the various traditions, and even within the traditions. Bronkhorst for example notices that the conception of what exactly &quot;liberating insight&quot; is in Buddhism was developed over time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the Four Truths served as such, to be superseded by &quot;pratityasamutpada&quot;, and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person. And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this &quot;liberating insight&quot; exist in the Buddhist canon.

===Phenomenology===
Nondual awareness, also called pure consciousness or awareness, contentless consciousness, consciousness-as-such, and Minimal Phenomenal Experience, is a topic of phenomenological research. As described in Samkhya-Yoga and other systems of meditation, and referred to as, for example, Turya and Atman, pure awareness manifests in advanced states of meditation. Pure consciousness is distinguished from the workings of the mind, and &quot;consists in nothing but the being seen of what is seen&quot;. Gamma &amp; Metzinger (2021) present twelve factors in their phenomenological analysis of pure awareness experienced by meditators, including luminosity; emptiness and non-egoic self-awareness; and witness-consciousness.

<text>Vani () is a town in Imereti region of a western Georgia, at the Sulori river (a tributary of the Rioni river), 41 km southwest from the regional capital Kutaisi. The town with the population of 3,744 (2014) is an administrative center of the Municipality of Vani comprising also 40 neighbouring villages (total area – 557 km2; population – 24,512, 2014).

== Archaeology ==
Systematic archaeological studies (N.Khoshtaria, O.Lortkiphanidze) carried out in the Vani environs since 1947 revealed the remnants of a rich city of the ancient power of Colchis. The name of this ancient settlement is still unknown but four distinct stages of uninterrupted occupation have been identified. The first phase is dated to the 8th to 7th centuries BC. In this period Vani is presumed to have been a major cultic centre. The second phase - end of the 7th and beginning of the 6th to the first half of the 4th century BC - is represented by cultural layers, remains of wooden structures, sacrificial altars cut in the rocky ground, and rich burials. It is assumed that on this stage Vani was the centre of a political-administrative unit of the kingdom of Colchis. The third phase covers the second half of the 4th to the first half of the 3rd century BC. It is represented largely by rich burials, remains of stone structures. To the fourth phase (3rd to mid-1st centuries BC) belong defensive walls, the so-called small gate, sanctuaries and cultic buildings (temples, altars sacrificial platforms), and the remains of a foundry for casting bronze statues. It is assumed that in the 3rd to 1st centuries BC Vani was a temple-city. According to the archaeological data, the city was destroyed in the mid-1st century BC. Subsequently, Vani declined to a village and was officially granted a status of a town only in 1981.

In a town Vani there is a museum (founded in 1985), where some unique pieces of the ancient Colchis are exhibited.

<text>Town Hall railway station is a heritage-listed underground commuter rail station located in the centre of the Sydney central business district in New South Wales, Australia. The station opened on 28 February 1932. It is named after the Sydney Town Hall, located directly above the station.

==History==
The station is built on the site of Sydney&#x27;s earliest colonial cemetery, the Old Sydney Burial Ground. In 2008, part of this cemetery was being excavated from under the Town Hall.

The station opened on 28 February 1932 and was built with six platforms, which were split over two levels with three platforms on each level. When the station opened, only four of the platforms were in use: platforms 1, 2 and 3 on the upper level and platform 6, served by escalators, on the lower level. The other two platforms were built in preparation for a proposed western suburbs line from the city to Gladesville, as envisaged under the Bradfield scheme. This line was never built, and the platforms (4 and 5) remained disused until incorporated into the Eastern Suburbs line when it opened in June 1979.

The station concourse had a major restructure in 2005 when the shops inside were closed to make way for the increasing crowds.

During a refurbishment of the station in 2014, a sign pointing to an air-raid shelter was uncovered on a staircase leading to Platforms 1 and 2. It has been encased in a Perspex casing.

==Station configuration==

Town Hall has two platform levels, each with three platforms – physically two island platforms, but set up so that one faces two tracks and the other faces the other track. Each platform has one lift in the centre connecting the concourse with the platforms, providing Easy Access for wheelchairs. These facilities were constructed in 1999. The lower-level platforms (4 to 6) have 4 escalators to the concourse. As the platform is not wide enough, the escalators are in a cross configuration, with two at either end of the platform and another two at the centre. The escalator directions can be changed by staff throughout the day as the passenger flow dictates. The upper-level platforms have stairs up to the concourse. There are also small staircases linking the two platform levels.

The concourse is above the two platform levels and immediately below street level. The station is linked to nearby shopping centres including the Queen Victoria Building, The Galeries, Town Hall Square, Pavilion Plaza and, Woolworths Supermarket. There are also several exits up to each side of George Street.

Opened in 2024, the Sydney Metro line includes another station located at Gadigal.

==Platforms and services==

==Transport links==

<text>Zoë Clare Keating (born February 2, 1972) is a Canadian-American cellist and composer once based in San Francisco, California, now based in Vermont.

==Music career==
Keating performed from 2002 to 2006 as second chair cellist in the cello rock band Rasputina. She is featured on Amanda Palmer&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Who Killed Amanda Palmer&quot;.

In her solo performances and recordings Keating uses live electronic sampling and repetition in order to layer the sound of her cello, creating rhythmically dense musical structures. , her self-produced album &quot;One Cello x 16: Natoma&quot; reached #1 on the iTunes classical charts four times, and &quot;Into the Trees&quot; spent 47 weeks on the Billboard classical chart, peaking at #7. She is the recipient of a 2009 Performing Arts Award from Creative Capital.

Keating&#x27;s songs have been featured in various commercials, TV shows, films, video games, and dance performances including HBO&#x27;s White Lotus, Amazon Prime&#x27;s Mammals, CBS&#x27;s Elementary, NBC&#x27;s Crisis, So You Think You Can Dance, MTV&#x27;s Teen Wolf, Dateline, Have You Heard from Johannesburg, The Day Carl Sandburg Died, Alice Walker: Beauty in Truth, The Retrieval, The Witness, and PBS&#x27;s Searching: Our Quest for Meaning in the Age of Science.

In January 2011, Keating won the award for Contemporary Classical Album from The 10th Annual Independent Music Awards.

In July 2011, Keating was named a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum. She performed at the closing ceremony of the forum&#x27;s Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland in January 2014 and 2016.

On September 1, 2013, the LA Times published an Op-Ed she authored. It discussed the positive and negative effects of her iTunes revenue on her Do-It-Yourself performing career.

Keating composed the score to A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;The Returned&quot; with Jeff Russo, and the pair composed music for season 2 of &quot;Manhattan&quot;, which aired in 2016 on WGN America.

Keating&#x27;s song &quot;Lost&quot; is the theme music to the podcast On Being.

In 2020, Keating composed the score to &quot;The Edge of All We Know&quot;, a documentary about black holes. In 2021, during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Keating co-composed, along with longtime collaborator Jeff Russo, the score to the HBO movie &quot;Oslo&quot;, a film adaptation of the Tony Award-winning play. On July 13, 2021, Keating and Russo&#x27;s score for &quot;Oslo&quot; was nominated for a 2021 Emmy for Outstanding Music Composition For A Limited Or Anthology Series, Movie Or Special.

Keating is one of the few artists to publish their revenue from streaming services, in order to help others get a better deal.

==Personal life==
In 1972, Keating was born in Guelph, Ontario, Canada to an English mother and an American father. She began playing the cello at the age of eight and attended Sarah Lawrence College in New York. Prior to 2005, she worked as an information architect. She worked on projects at the now defunct Perspecta, Inc., and the Research Libraries Group (now part of OCLC) and the Database of Recorded American Music.

In March, 2010, Keating announced via her website that she was expecting her first child with her husband, Jeff Rusch, in May.

Rusch was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in May, 2014, and was admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment. Days later, Keating and Rusch received a letter denying coverage for this hospital stay by their insurance company, Anthem. After local media publicized the story, Anthem Blue Cross reversed its decision, telling Keating in a phone call that the hospital stay would be covered. Rusch died on February 19, 2015.

Keating continues to advocate for patients, data portability and the simplification of medical insurance.

In October 2016 she was invited to participate in a panel discussion at the Frontiers Conference with President Barack Obama, Riccardo Sabatini and Kafui Dzirasa, moderated by Atul Guwande.

<text>Siga was a Berber and Roman port located near what is now Aïn Témouchent, Algeria. Under the Roman Empire, it was part of western Mauretania Caesariensis, bordering Mauretania Tingitana.

==History==
Siga was a major Mediterranean port in the ancient Kingdom of Numidia. It was located at the western border of the territory of the Masaesyli, a Berber tribe. Their traditional opponents were the Berber confederation of the Maesulians, who ruled the eastern portion.

In the course of the Second Punic War, King Syphax of the Masaesyli allied himself with the Roman Republic and the armies led by Scipio Africanus, while the Maesulians ruled by Masinissa sided with Carthage. With the defeat and capture of Syphax by Masinissa, the western tribes were conquered and gradually absorbed into a united kingdom under his rule. His successors minted coins at Siga with Punic script, in which its name appears as &quot;Shigan&quot; (, ).

After a temporary decline, the city got some importance inside the Roman Africa, especially with African emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla. With the Arab conquest, during the second half of the seventh century, disappeared all references to Siga in documented history.

Number of visible or hidden monuments extend on both banks of the river Tafna (called &quot;Siga&quot; in Roman times) including the famous &quot;Numidian mausoleum&quot;, the fortified acropolis and some Roman hydraulic and thermal facilities.

==Religion==
The current Roman Catholic titular see of &quot;Sigus&quot; is probably based on this location, but there was another Sigus in western Numidia.

<doc id="577053" wikidata="Q386780" url="?curid=577053" title="Association rule learning">
<text>Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. In any given transaction with a variety of items, association rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items are connected.

Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule formula_1 found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.

In addition to the above example from market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.

The association rule algorithm itself consists of various parameters that can make it difficult for those without some expertise in data mining to execute, with many rules that are arduous to understand.

== Definition ==
Following the original definition by Agrawal, Imieliński, Swami the problem of association rule mining is defined as:

Let formula_2 be a set of binary attributes called &quot;items&quot;.

Let formula_3 be a set of transactions called the &quot;database&quot;.

Each &quot;transaction&quot; in has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in .

A &quot;rule&quot; is defined as an implication of the form:

:formula_4, where formula_5.

In Agrawal, Imieliński, Swami a &quot;rule&quot; is defined only between a set and a single item, formula_6 for formula_7.

Every rule is composed by two different sets of items, also known as &quot;itemsets&quot;, and , where is called &quot;antecedent&quot; or left-hand-side (LHS) and &quot;consequent&quot; or right-hand-side (RHS). The antecedent is that item that can be found in the data while the consequent is the item found when combined with the antecedent. The statement formula_4 is often read as &quot;if then &quot;, where the antecedent ( ) is the &quot;if&quot; and the consequent () is the &quot;then&quot;. This simply implies that, in theory, whenever occurs in a dataset, then will as well.

== Process ==
Association rules are made by searching data for frequent if-then patterns and by using a certain criterion under Support and Confidence to define what the most important relationships are. Support is the evidence of how frequent an item appears in the data given, as Confidence is defined by how many times the if-then statements are found true. However, there is a third criteria that can be used, it is called Lift and it can be used to compare the expected Confidence and the actual Confidence. Lift will show how many times the if-then statement is expected to be found to be true.

Association rules are made to calculate from itemsets, which are created by two or more items. If the rules were built from the analyzing from all the possible itemsets from the data then there would be so many rules that they wouldn’t have any meaning. That is why Association rules are typically made from rules that are well represented by the data.

There are many different data mining techniques you could use to find certain analytics and results, for example, there is Classification analysis, Clustering analysis, and Regression analysis. What technique you should use depends on what you are looking for with your data. Association rules are primarily used to find analytics and a prediction of customer behavior. For Classification analysis, it would most likely be used to question, make decisions, and predict behavior. Clustering analysis is primarily used when there are no assumptions made about the likely relationships within the data. Regression analysis Is used when you want to predict the value of a continuous dependent from a number of independent variables.

Benefits

There are many benefits of using Association rules like finding the pattern that helps understand the correlations and co-occurrences between data sets. A very good real-world example that uses Association rules would be medicine. Medicine uses Association rules to help diagnose patients. When diagnosing patients there are many variables to consider as many diseases will share similar symptoms. With the use of the Association rules, doctors can determine the conditional probability of an illness by comparing symptom relationships from past cases.

Downsides

However, Association rules also lead to many different downsides such as finding the appropriate parameter and threshold settings for the mining algorithm. But there is also the downside of having a large number of discovered rules. The reason is that this does not guarantee that the rules will be found relevant, but it could also cause the algorithm to have low performance. Sometimes the implemented algorithms will contain too many variables and parameters. For someone that doesn’t have a good concept of data mining, this might cause them to have trouble understanding it.

ThresholdsWhen using Association rules, you are most likely to only use Support and Confidence. However, this means you have to satisfy a user-specified minimum support and a user-specified minimum confidence at the same time. Usually, the Association rule generation is split into two different steps that needs to be applied:

# A minimum Support threshold to find all the frequent itemsets that are in the database.
# A minimum Confidence threshold to the frequent itemsets found to create rules.
The Support Threshold is 30%, Confidence Threshold is 50%

The Table on the left is the original unorganized data and the table on the right is organized by the thresholds. In this case Item C is better than the thresholds for both Support and Confidence which is why it is first. Item A is second because its threshold values are spot on. Item D has met the threshold for Support but not Confidence. Item B has not met the threshold for either Support or Confidence and that is why it is last.

To find all the frequent itemsets in a database is not an easy task since it involves going through all the data to find all possible item combinations from all possible itemsets. The set of possible itemsets is the power set over and has size formula_9 , of course this means to exclude the empty set which is not considered to be a valid itemset. However, the size of the power set will grow exponentially in the number of item that is within the power set . An efficient search is possible by using the downward-closure property of support (also called &quot;anti-monotonicity&quot;). This would guarantee that a frequent itemset and all its subsets are also frequent and thus will have no infrequent itemsets as a subset of a frequent itemset. Exploiting this property, efficient algorithms (e.g., Apriori and Eclat) can find all frequent itemsets.

== Useful Concepts ==

To illustrate the concepts, we use a small example from the supermarket domain. Table 2 shows a small database containing the items where, in each entry, the value 1 means the presence of the item in the corresponding transaction, and the value 0 represents the absence of an item in that transaction. The set of items is formula_10.

An example rule for the supermarket could be formula_11 meaning that if butter and bread are bought, customers also buy milk.

In order to select interesting rules from the set of all possible rules, constraints on various measures of significance and interest are used. The best-known constraints are minimum thresholds on support and confidence.

Let formula_12 be itemsets, formula_4 an association rule and a set of transactions of a given database.

Note: this example is extremely small. In practical applications, a rule needs a support of several hundred transactions before it can be considered statistically significant, and datasets often contain thousands or millions of transactions.

=== Support ===
Support is an indication of how frequently the itemset appears in the dataset.

In our example, it can be easier to explain support by writing formula_14 where A and B are separate item sets that occur at the same time in a transaction.

Using Table 2 as an example, the itemset formula_15 has a support of since it occurs in 20% of all transactions (1 out of 5 transactions). The argument of &quot;support of X&quot; is a set of preconditions, and thus becomes more restrictive as it grows (instead of more inclusive).

Furthermore, the itemset formula_16 has a support of as it appears in 20% of all transactions as well.

When using antecedents and consequents, it allows a data miner to determine the support of multiple items being bought together in comparison to the whole data set. For example, Table 2 shows that if milk is bought, then bread is bought has a support of 0.4 or 40%. This because in 2 out 5 of the transactions, milk as well as bread are bought. In smaller data sets like this example, it is harder to see a strong correlation when there are few samples, but when the data set grows larger, support can be used to find correlation between two or more products in the supermarket example.

Minimum support thresholds are useful for determining which itemsets are preferred or interesting.

If we set the support threshold to ≥0.4 in Table 3, then the formula_17 would be removed since it did not meet the minimum threshold of 0.4. Minimum threshold is used to remove samples where there is not a strong enough support or confidence to deem the sample as important or interesting in the dataset.

Another way of finding interesting samples is to find the value of (support)×(confidence); this allows a data miner to see the samples where support and confidence are high enough to be highlighted in the dataset and prompt a closer look at the sample to find more information on the connection between the items.

Support can be beneficial for finding the connection between products in comparison to the whole dataset, whereas confidence looks at the connection between one or more items and another item. Below is a table that shows the comparison and contrast between support and support × confidence, using the information from Table 4 to derive the confidence values.

The support of with respect to is defined as the proportion of transactions in the dataset which contains the itemset . Denoting a transaction by formula_18 where is the unique identifier of the transaction and is its itemset, the support may be written as:

:formula_19

This notation can be used when defining more complicated datasets where the items and itemsets may not be as easy as our supermarket example above. Other examples of where support can be used is in finding groups of genetic mutations that work collectively to cause a disease, investigating the number of subscribers that respond to upgrade offers, and discovering which products in a drug store are never bought together.

=== Confidence ===
Confidence is the percentage of all transactions satisfying that also satisfy .

With respect to , the confidence value of an association rule, often denoted as formula_4, is the ratio of transactions containing both and to the total amount of values present, where is the antecedent and is the consequent.

Confidence can also be interpreted as an estimate of the conditional probability formula_21, the probability of finding the RHS of the rule in transactions under the condition that these transactions also contain the LHS.

It is commonly depicted as:

:formula_22

The equation illustrates that confidence can be computed by calculating the co-occurrence of transactions and within the dataset in ratio to transactions containing only . This means that the number of transactions in both and is divided by those just in .

For example, Table 2 shows the rule formula_11 which has a confidence of formula_24 in the dataset, which denotes that every time a customer buys butter and bread, they also buy milk. This particular example demonstrates the rule being correct 100% of the time for transactions containing both butter and bread. The rule formula_25, however, has a confidence of formula_26. This suggests that eggs are bought 67% of the times that fruit is brought. Within this particular dataset, fruit is purchased a total of 3 times, with two of those times consisting of egg purchases.

For larger datasets, a minimum threshold, or a percentage cutoff, for the confidence can be useful for determining item relationships. When applying this method to some of the data in Table 2, information that does not meet the requirements are removed. Table 4 shows association rule examples where the minimum threshold for confidence is 0.5 (50%). Any data that does not have a confidence of at least 0.5 is omitted. Generating thresholds allow for the association between items to become stronger as the data is further researched by emphasizing those that co-occur the most. The table uses the confidence information from Table 3 to implement the Support × Confidence column, where the relationship between items via their both confidence and support, instead of just one concept, is highlighted. Ranking the rules by Support × Confidence multiples the confidence of a particular rule to its support and is often implemented for a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between the items.

Overall, using confidence in association rule mining is great way to bring awareness to data relations. Its greatest benefit is highlighting the relationship between particular items to one another within the set, as it compares co-occurrences of items to the total occurrence of the antecedent in the specific rule. However, confidence is not the optimal method for every concept in association rule mining. The disadvantage of using it is that it does not offer multiple difference outlooks on the associations. Unlike support, for instance, confidence does not provide the perspective of relationships between certain items in comparison to the entire dataset, so while milk and bread, for example, may occur 100% of the time for confidence, it only has a support of 0.4 (40%). This is why it is important to look at other viewpoints, such as Support × Confidence, instead of solely relying on one concept incessantly to define the relationships.

=== Lift ===
The &quot;lift&quot; of a rule is defined as:

formula_27

or the ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent.

For example, the rule formula_28 has a lift of formula_29.

If the rule had a lift of 1, it would imply that the probability of occurrence of the antecedent and that of the consequent are independent of each other. When two events are independent of each other, no rule can be drawn involving those two events.

If the lift is &gt; 1, that lets us know the degree to which those two occurrences are dependent on one another, and makes those rules potentially useful for predicting the consequent in future data sets.

If the lift is &lt; 1, that lets us know the items are substitute to each other. This means that presence of one item has negative effect on presence of other item and vice versa.

The value of lift is that it considers both the support of the rule and the overall data set.

[rede]

=== Conviction ===
The &quot;conviction&quot; of a rule is defined as formula_30.

For example, the rule formula_28 has a conviction of formula_32, and can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y (that is to say, the frequency that the rule makes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions. In this example, the conviction value of 1.2 shows that the rule formula_28 would be incorrect 20% more often (1.2 times as often) if the association between X and Y was purely random chance.

=== Alternative measures of interestingness ===
In addition to confidence, other measures of &quot;interestingness&quot; for rules have been proposed. Some popular measures are:

* All-confidence

Several more measures are presented and compared by Tan et al. and by Hahsler. Looking for techniques that can model what the user has known (and using these models as interestingness measures) is currently an active research trend under the name of &quot;Subjective Interestingness.&quot;

==History==
The concept of association rules was popularized particularly due to the 1993 article of Agrawal et al., which has acquired more than 23,790 citations according to Google Scholar, as of April 2021, and is thus one of the most cited papers in the Data Mining field. However, what is now called &quot;association rules&quot; is introduced already in the 1966 paper on GUHA, a general data mining method developed by Petr Hájek et al.

An early (circa 1989) use of minimum support and confidence to find all association rules is the Feature Based Modeling framework, which found all rules with formula_34 and formula_35 greater than user defined constraints.

== Statistically sound associations ==

One limitation of the standard approach to discovering associations is that by searching massive numbers of possible associations to look for collections of items that appear to be associated, there is a large risk of finding many spurious associations. These are collections of items that co-occur with unexpected frequency in the data, but only do so by chance. For example, suppose we are considering a collection of 10,000 items and looking for rules containing two items in the left-hand-side and 1 item in the right-hand-side. There are approximately 1,000,000,000,000 such rules. If we apply a statistical test for independence with a significance level of 0.05 it means there is only a 5% chance of accepting a rule if there is no association. If we assume there are no associations, we should nonetheless expect to find 50,000,000,000 rules. Statistically sound association discovery controls this risk, in most cases reducing the risk of finding &quot;any&quot; spurious associations to a user-specified significance level.

== Algorithms ==

Many algorithms for generating association rules have been proposed.

Some well-known algorithms are Apriori, Eclat and FP-Growth, but they only do half the job, since they are algorithms for mining frequent itemsets. Another step needs to be done after to generate rules from frequent itemsets found in a database.

=== Apriori algorithm ===
Apriori is given by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994 for frequent item set mining and association rule learning. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often. The name of the algorithm is Apriori because it uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties.
Overview: Apriori uses a &quot;bottom up&quot; approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as &quot;candidate generation&quot;), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. Apriori uses breadth-first search and a Hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates candidate item sets of length  from item sets of length . Then it prunes the candidates which have an infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent -length item sets. After that, it scans the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the candidates.

Example: Assume that each row is a cancer sample with a certain combination of mutations labeled by a character in the alphabet. For example a row could have {a, c} which means it is affected by mutation &#x27;a&#x27; and mutation &#x27;c&#x27;. 

Now we will generate the frequent item set by counting the number of occurrences of each character. This is also known as finding the support values. Then we will prune the item set by picking a minimum support threshold. For this pass of the algorithm we will pick 3. 

Since all support values are three or above there is no pruning. The frequent item set is {a}, {b}, {c}, and {d}. After this we will repeat the process by counting pairs of mutations in the input set. 

Now we will make our minimum support value 4 so only {a, d} will remain after pruning. Now we will use the frequent item set to make combinations of triplets. We will then repeat the process by counting occurrences of triplets of mutations in the input set. 

Since we only have one item the next set of combinations of quadruplets is empty so the algorithm will stop.

Advantages and Limitations:

Apriori has some limitations. Candidate generation can result in large candidate sets. For example a 10^4 frequent 1-itemset will generate a 10^7 candidate 2-itemset. The algorithm also needs to frequently scan the database, to be specific n+1 scans where n is the length of the longest pattern. Apriori is slower than the Eclat algorithm. However, Apriori performs well compared to Eclat when the dataset is large. This is because in the Eclat algorithm if the dataset is too large the tid-lists become too large for memory. FP-growth outperforms the Apriori and Eclat. This is due to the FP-growth algorithm not having candidate generation or test, using a compact data structure, and only having one database scan.

=== Eclat algorithm ===

Eclat (alt. ECLAT, stands for Equivalence Class Transformation) is a backtracking algorithm, which traverses the frequent itemset lattice graph in a depth-first search (DFS) fashion. Whereas the breadth-first search (BFS) traversal used in the Apriori algorithm will end up checking every subset of an itemset before checking it, DFS traversal checks larger itemsets and can save on checking the support of some of its subsets by virtue of the downward-closer property. Furthermore it will almost certainly use less memory as DFS has a lower space complexity than BFS.

To illustrate this, let there be a frequent itemset {a, b, c}. a DFS may check the nodes in the frequent itemset lattice in the following order: {a} → {a, b} → {a, b, c}, at which point it is known that {b}, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c} all satisfy the support constraint by the downward-closure property. BFS would explore each subset of {a, b, c} before finally checking it. As the size of an itemset increases, the number of its subsets undergoes combinatorial explosion.

It is suitable for both sequential as well as parallel execution with locality-enhancing properties.

=== FP-growth algorithm ===

FP stands for frequent pattern.

In the first pass, the algorithm counts the occurrences of items (attribute-value pairs) in the dataset of transactions, and stores these counts in a &#x27;header table&#x27;. In the second pass, it builds the FP-tree structure by inserting transactions into a trie.

Items in each transaction have to be sorted by descending order of their frequency in the dataset before being inserted so that the tree can be processed quickly.
Items in each transaction that do not meet the minimum support requirement are discarded.
If many transactions share most frequent items, the FP-tree provides high compression close to tree root.

Recursive processing of this compressed version of the main dataset grows frequent item sets directly, instead of generating candidate items and testing them against the entire database (as in the apriori algorithm).

Growth begins from the bottom of the header table i.e. the item with the smallest support by finding all sorted transactions that end in that item. Call this item formula_36.

A new conditional tree is created which is the original FP-tree projected onto formula_36. The supports of all nodes in the projected tree are re-counted with each node getting the sum of its children counts. Nodes (and hence subtrees) that do not meet the minimum support are pruned. Recursive growth ends when no individual items conditional on formula_36 meet the minimum support threshold. The resulting paths from root to formula_36 will be frequent itemsets. After this step, processing continues with the next least-supported header item of the original FP-tree.

Once the recursive process has completed, all frequent item sets will have been found, and association rule creation begins.

=== Others ===

==== ASSOC ====

The ASSOC procedure is a GUHA method which mines for generalized association rules using fast bitstrings operations. The association rules mined by this method are more general than those output by apriori, for example &quot;items&quot; can be connected both with conjunction and disjunctions and the relation between antecedent and consequent of the rule is not restricted to setting minimum support and confidence as in apriori: an arbitrary combination of supported interest measures can be used.

==== OPUS search ====

OPUS is an efficient algorithm for rule discovery that, in contrast to most alternatives, does not require either monotone or anti-monotone constraints such as minimum support. Initially used to find rules for a fixed consequent it has subsequently been extended to find rules with any item as a consequent. OPUS search is the core technology in the popular Magnum Opus association discovery system.

== Lore ==
A famous story about association rule mining is the &quot;beer and diaper&quot; story. A purported survey of behavior of supermarket shoppers discovered that customers (presumably young men) who buy diapers tend also to buy beer. This anecdote became popular as an example of how unexpected association rules might be found from everyday data. There are varying opinions as to how much of the story is true. Daniel Powers says:

In 1992, Thomas Blischok, manager of a retail consulting group at Teradata, and his staff prepared an analysis of 1.2 million market baskets from about 25 Osco Drug stores. Database queries were developed to identify affinities. The analysis &quot;did discover that between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. that consumers bought beer and diapers&quot;. Osco managers did NOT exploit the beer and diapers relationship by moving the products closer together on the shelves.

== Other types of association rule mining ==

Multi-Relation Association Rules (MRAR): These are association rules where each item may have several relations. These relations indicate indirect relationships between the entities. Consider the following MRAR where the first item consists of three relations &quot;live in&quot;, &quot;nearby&quot; and &quot;humid&quot;: “Those who &quot;live in&quot; a place which is &quot;nearby&quot; a city with &quot;humid&quot; climate type and also are &quot;younger&quot; than 20 formula_40 their &quot;health condition&quot; is good”. Such association rules can be extracted from RDBMS data or semantic web data.

Contrast set learning is a form of associative learning. Contrast set learners use rules that differ meaningfully in their distribution across subsets.

Weighted class learning is another form of associative learning where weights may be assigned to classes to give focus to a particular issue of concern for the consumer of the data mining results.

High-order pattern discovery facilitates the capture of high-order (polythetic) patterns or event associations that are intrinsic to complex real-world data.
K-optimal pattern discovery provides an alternative to the standard approach to association rule learning which requires that each pattern appear frequently in the data.

Approximate Frequent Itemset mining is a relaxed version of Frequent Itemset mining that allows some of the items in some of the rows to be 0.

Generalized Association Rules hierarchical taxonomy (concept hierarchy)

Quantitative Association Rules categorical and quantitative data

Interval Data Association Rules e.g. partition the age into 5-year-increment ranged

Sequential pattern mining discovers subsequences that are common to more than minsup (minimum support threshold) sequences in a sequence database, where minsup is set by the user. A sequence is an ordered list of transactions.

Subspace Clustering, a specific type of clustering high-dimensional data, is in many variants also based on the downward-closure property for specific clustering models.

Warmr, shipped as part of the ACE data mining suite, allows association rule learning for first order relational rules.

<text>Ernie Krivda (born February 6, 1945, in Cleveland, Ohio as Krvda Ernö) is a jazz saxophonist, flutist, bandleader, and educator.

Ernie Krivda, who is of Hungarian and Sicilian heritage, began his professional career in 1963 with the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra. During the 1960s he played in bands of two Cleveland legends, organist Eddie Baccus and guitarist Bill DeArango. Later, in the early 1970s, he became the leader of the house band of the Smiling Dog Saloon. There he shared the stage with Chick Corea, Elvin Jones, Herbie Hancock and many others. Alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley heard Krivda and recommended him to Quincy Jones. After touring and recording with Jones, Krivda moved to New York and signed a contract with Inner City Records. A series of albums received great critical acclaim.

Krivda has since recorded numerous additional albums, eighteen in all, and has appeared at such prestigious venues as The Kool Jazz Festival, The North Sea Jazz Festival and at Carnegie Hall. In the 1990s, Krivda made recordings for Cadence, Koch International and C.I.M.P. Records. It was during this time that he founded The Fat Tuesday Big Band in Northeast Ohio. He continued to tour including concerts in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City.

He remains active in education as artistic director of The Cuyahoga Community College Jazz Studies Program in Cleveland, Ohio and touring clinician for The Yamaha Instrument Company. Among his gigs was a tribute to Stan Getz at Cleveland&#x27;s Severance Hall, home of The Cleveland Orchestra at which Krivda played Eddie Sauter&#x27;s FOCUS. It was the first performance of this piece since Stan Getz played it in 1961.

Krivda has been the recipient of many Cleveland awards including the &quot;Free Times&quot; Readers Poll for Best Jazz Act, Best Swing Big Band and Best Horn Player. He has also won The Editors Choice of ClevelandSearch.com, as The city&#x27;s Best Instrumentalist. He continues to be the subject of articles in national publications, such as Down Beat and Jazz Times Magazine, and his work is documented in The Encyclopedia of Jazz and many Jazz Record Guides.

It is especially useful in the modelling of queuing systems, with many statistics being collected automatically. The typical simulation consists of &quot;Transactions&quot; being generated in the system (usually at a certain interval), performing a defined set of rules (like use a resource, wait, transfer), and being removed from the simulation.

==History==
GPSS was developed in the 1960s by Geoffrey Gordon, an employee of IBM&#x27;s Advanced Systems Development Division (ASDD). This division was heavily involved with research into the design of teleprocessing systems, trying to achieve an economic balance of the use of computer resources and shared lines between server terminals. The simulation system, then known as the Gordon Simulator, became very popular in the study of teleprocessing systems within ASDD. It subsequently was fixed and documented on October 25, 1960 in an internal IBM memorandum. Between the winter and summer of 1961, a group of three programmers (including Gordon) rewrote the simulation system with a new algorithm and new block types. It was officially released as a supported IBM-label program on September 27, 1961 with 25 block types. At this point, Gordon stopped working on the simulation system.

In 1963, GPSS II was released with 32 block types. It introduced system numerical attributes, which allowed tracking the current content of a &quot;Storage&quot;, the length of a &quot;Queue&quot;, or the current clock time.

In 1965, GPSS III was released. It was made available for IBM Systems 7090/94 and 7040/44.

In 1967, GPSS/360 was released to run on the newly released System 360.

In 1970, GPSS V was released with 49 block types.

In the 1980s, GPSS/VAC and GPSS/PC were released. These appear to be the last official IBM-label releases before the language became unlicensed.

Subsequently, there were releases for IBM 360, Univac 1108, and CDC.

Over time, other implementations were developed for systems including DEC&#x27;s VAX, a specialized APL version for large-scale Univac systems, and Macintosh.

In 2001, the Windows program GPSS World was released with new features to GPSS. It includes scripting with PLUS (a Pascal-like language), graphical system state displays, graphing, and optimization experiments.

In 2009, a graphical Java-based tool called JGPSS (Java General Purpose Simulation System) was developed to teach the GPSS simulation language.

==Description==
A GPSS simulation is written in an Assembly-style &quot;block diagram language&quot; with many different single-purpose commands (&quot;Blocks&quot;) to control the flow of a &quot;Transaction&quot;, statistics collection, and variables. 

Simulations have &quot;Transaction&quot; entry points through the codice_1 command, such as a customer walking into a store. Then, actions are performed through claiming &quot;Facilities&quot;/&quot;Storage&quot; (like a cashier), waiting, saving statistics, etc. Finally, the simulated transaction exits the simulation through the codice_2 command. Each command verb is referred to as a &quot;control&quot;.

Blocks can be facility-oriented (such as machines in a job shop) or transaction-oriented (such parts of work-in-process, signals in electronic components or documents in a bureaucratic procedure). GPSS automatically keep track of statistics for display on a report. 

Entities can be broadly classified in Resources, Computational entities and Statistical entities. Resources, like &quot;Facilities&quot; and &quot;Storages&quot; represent limited capacity resources. Computational entities, like &quot;Ampervariables&quot; (variables), &quot;Functions&quot; and random generators are used to represent the state of Transactions or elements of their environment. Statistical entities, like &quot;Queues&quot; or &quot;Tables&quot; (histograms) collect statistical information of interest.

== Basic Transaction commands ==
Transactions can :

* Automatically enter the simulation (GENERATE)
* Use a facility or storage (SEIZE/ENTER respectively)
* Stop using a facility or storage (RELEASE/LEAVE respectively)
* Wait (ADVANCE)
* Transfer to another section of code (TRANSFER)
* Exit the simulation (TERMINATE)

Along with these main tasks, they can also hold parameters with the ASSIGN command. Transactions are implicitly sectioned off in the code.

There can be multiple transactions in the code that happen at once. A transaction starts with GENERATE and ends with TERMINATE. The code inbetween could potentially be shared between multiple transactions by means of the TRANSFER command, but besides that your transaction lifecycles will be separated. It helps to add whitespace between lines of action of one transaction versus another.

=== GENERATE ===
 GENERATE 0.1
Transaction generated every 0.1 time unit.
 GENERATE 15,4
Transaction is generation every 15 time units, plus or minus 4 time units.

GENERATE

=== ADVANCE ===
To have a transaction wait, use the ADVANCE command. It has similar arguments to GENERATE.
 ADVANCE 10,6
Transaction waits 10+-6 seconds.

ADVANCE

=== SEIZE, RELEASE (Facilities) ===
To use a Facility, which only allows one use at a time, use the SEIZE command. To stop using it, use the RELEASE command.
 GENERATE 30,5 ; Generate a customer every 30+-5 time units
 SEIZE Barber ; Use a facility
 ADVANCE 15,4 ; Wait 15+-4 time units
 RELEASE Barber ; Stop using the facility
 TERMINATE 1 ; Leave the barber shop
If you want more than one use at a time, use Storage.

SEIZE

RELEASE

=== ENTER, LEAVE (Storages) ===
 Seating STORAGE 100 ; 100 people allowed in lounge seating
 GENERATE 10,5 ; Generate a person every 10+-5 time units
 ENTER Seating,1 ; Person sits down
 ADVANCE 15,4 ; Wait 15+-4 time units
 LEAVE Barber,1 ; Person stops sitting
 TERMINATE 1 ; Exit the seating area
This way, multiple people can sit in the Seating at once. If this was a &quot;Facility&quot; (using SEIZE/RELEASE), it would block others who tried to use the resource.

The ENTER command takes the storage reference as Argument A and the amount to reserve with Argument B. The LEAVE command&#x27;s arguments are the same.

ENTER

LEAVE

=== TERMINATE ===
To remove the transaction, use TERMINATE.

The optional argument decrements the completion counter, which is a variable that is chosen by the user when running the simulation. Say you wanted to test 100 customers: you would start the execution of your simulation with codice_3. codice_4 at the end of each transaction would decrement initial value 100 by 1 (99, 98, 97 ...) until it reached zero. At this point, the simulation stops and results are returned. If you omit the argument in TERMINATE, it will be assumed to be 0. This means your simulation will run forever (unless, of course, you have another TERMINATE that does decrement this counter.

TERMINATE

==== Timer ====
To have your program run for a predetermined time, make sure none of your TERMINATES decrement the counter and include a section like this:
 GENERATE ; Generate one transaction
 ADVANCE 100 ; Run for 100 time units
 TERMINATE 1 ; End
Then run your program with START 1. It will run for 100 time units.

=== ASSIGN (Parameter &quot;Metadata&quot;) ===
Use the ASSIGN control block to assign a value to a transaction parameter. Called with Pj (j=parameter number)
 ASSIGN 2,V$Orderqty     ;Parameter 2=Order quantity
 Custwait    ADVANCE 5               ;Lead time is 5 days
 ENTER Stock,P2          ;Stock increases by P2
ASSIGN : ASSIGN Blocks are used to place or modify a value in a Transaction Parameter.

==Examples==

=== Barber Shop ===
The following example, taken from &quot;Simulation using GPSS&quot;, is the &quot;Hello world!&quot; of GPSS and will illustrate the main concepts.

The aim is to simulate one day of operation of a barber shop. Customers arrive in a random constant flow, enter the shop, queue if the barber is busy, get their hair cut on a first-come first-served basis, and then leave the shop. We wish to know the average and maximum waiting line, as well as the number of customers.

The &quot;program&quot; is comprised between the codice_5 and codice_6 statements, and is divided into &quot;model segments&quot; and &quot;control cards&quot;.

The first segment models customers. The codice_1 block creates a flow of Transactions and schedules them to enter the model with an inter-arrival time uniformly distributed over the range 18±6. It is the programmer&#x27;s responsibility to interpret these transaction as customers and to understand that the time is to be counted in minutes. The Transactions start their existence in the codice_1 block and progress from Block to Block, according to certain rules, until they reach a codice_2 which remove them from the model.

Normally transactions progress from one block to the next one, so the customer transactions will leave the codice_1 block to enter the codice_11 block. This block simulates a waiting line, and collects statistics accordingly. In the example, it materialize a line of chairs and, at the end of the simulation, we will know, among other things, the maximum queue size (how many chairs are needed) and the average waiting time. The codice_12 block requires the name of the queue as a parameter, because more than one queue may exist in the model. Each one is associated with a codice_13 block, which is triggered when the transaction leaves the queue. GPSS remembers which transactions are in the queue, so that it possible to know the average time spent, and to check that no buggy transaction is leaving a queue without previously entering in it.
After the codice_14 block, the transaction will try to proceed to the codice_15 block, a block simulating the capture of the &quot;Facility&quot; named Joe. Facilities model single servers of capacity one. If the facility is busy, the codice_16 will deny the attempting transaction the right to enter. In the example, the customer will wait in the codice_12 block. If it is free, or as soon as it becomes available, the transaction will be allowed to capture the facility, mark it as busy to others transactions and start to count the service time and other statistics, until the same transaction passes the corresponding codice_18 block.

The codice_16 / codice_20 pairs are linked by the facility name, because many independent facilities may exist in the model. They can model operators, like a barber, a repairman, an agent, but also pieces of equipment, like a crane, a gas station, an authorization document, etc., in fact anything with capacity one. To simulate multiple parallel servers, like a team of five barbers, or an oven with a capacity of 10, GPSS uses entities named codice_21s.

After a customer seizes Joe, she proceeds to the next statement which is codice_22, whose task is to freeze the entity for a prescribed length of time, here a random number picked between 16-4=12 and 16+4=20mn. Other service time distributions are available through GPSS codice_23 (a somehow different notion than function in other programming languages). During that time, other transactions will be allowed to move through the model, blocking some other facilities that may exist in the model, but not Joe because this facility is busy with the frozen customer. After the prescribed time, the customer will wake up, proceed to the next statement, which will free Joe, and codice_2.

Then the next transaction on the previous block, that is a customer sitting on a chair, will be able to codice_15. To select the &quot;next&quot; transaction, GPSS uses the first-come first-served basis, with priority. Other selection policies can be programmed by direct manipulation of the &quot;future event chain&quot; entity.

In parallel to this first segment, simulating the customer behavior, a second model segment simulates the end of the day. At time 480mn = 8h an entity is codice_1d, which will codice_2 on the next block. This time, the codice_2 as a parameter of 1, meaning a special counter is decreased by 1. When that counter reaches 0, the program stops and the output is printed. This special counter is set up with the codice_29 statement. In the example, it is set to one, thus the simulation will finish after one run of 480 mn in simulated time.

The output contains:

It indicates that Joe was busy 86.0% of the time, gave a hair cut to 26 customers and that hair cut took 15.88 minutes on the average. Incidentally, Joe was cutting the hair of customer number 26 when the simulation was closed. No programming provisions were taken for the barber to finish the hair cut before closing the shop.

It indicates also that a maximum of 1 customer was observed waiting his turn, in fact the number of waiting customer was on the average 0.160. A total of 27 customers did enter the queue, so that customer number 27 was still sitting, waiting his turn, when Joe closed the shop. Out of these 27 customers, 12 were served without having to wait. In fact, the queue was empty 44.4% of the time. The average waiting time was 2.851 min, and the average waiting time for the 15=27-12 customers who did really wait was 5.133 min.

<doc id="577091" wikidata="Q674612" url="?curid=577091" title="Mirror Universe">
<text>The Mirror Universe is the setting of several narratives in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction franchise, a parallel universe existing alongside, but separate from, the fictional universe that is the main setting of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. It resembles the main &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, but is populated by more violent and opportunistic doubles of its people. The Mirror Universe has been visited in one episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, five episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, a two-part episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise,&quot; a storyline woven through the first season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; (continuing with a Mirror Universe character in the main cast of seasons 2 and 3), and several non-canon &quot;Star Trek&quot; tie-in works. It is named after &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, the &quot;Original Series&quot; episode in which it first appeared.

==Characteristics==
The characters in the Mirror Universe are aggressive, mistrustful and opportunistic in personality. Whereas the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe depicts an optimistic future in which the Earth-based United Federation of Planets values peace, co-operation and exploration, episodes set in the Mirror Universe feature the human-dominated authoritarian Terran Empire which values war, despotism and conquest instead. Humans in the Mirror Universe are typically referred to as &quot;Terrans&quot;.

In &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, it is stated that humans from the Mirror Universe suffer from photophobia (a sensitivity to light).

==Television appearances==

===&quot;The Original Series&quot;===
The Mirror Universe was first introduced in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, which featured a brutal Empire, managed by humans and their Vulcan allies, in place of the United Federation of Planets. The Mirror Captain Kirk of the ISS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a mass murderer who was promoted to Captain after assassinating Captain Christopher Pike. Discipline aboard starships was enforced through agony booths and agonizers carried by crewmembers. Officers were barbaric in behavior and advanced in rank by killing superiors who they thought were incompetent. Roman Empire salutes were used by crewmembers to show loyalty to their captain. Spock&#x27;s double wore a goatee, which became a popular culture trope as a visual marker for an evil version of a character.

====Episodes====
===&quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;===
The Mirror Universe was later revisited in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; second-season episode &quot;Crossover&quot;, and turned into a story arc that spanned into the final season, with five Mirror Universe episodes over the course of five seasons. The series reveals that when exposed to individuals from the normal universe, the Terran Empire began to reform itself for the better, but was overthrown in the 23rd century by an alliance of alien species who took advantage of the Empire&#x27;s self-weakening and conquered it, enslaving humans and Vulcans in the process.

====Episodes====
===&quot;Enterprise&quot;===
A two-part episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, entitled &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;, introduces the early developments of the Mirror Universe. This is the first episode which takes place entirely in the Mirror Universe, and in which no Prime Universe characters appear.

====Episodes====
===&quot;Discovery&quot;===
The first season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; has a storyline involving the Mirror Universe. Captain Gabriel Lorca, commander of the USS &quot;Discovery&quot;, is discovered to be an inhabitant of the Mirror Universe on account of his intolerance to bright light, a genetic trait common to all humans from the Mirror Universe.

In 2018, Comic Book Resources rated &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; Mirror Universe saga as the 18th best multi-part episode story of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

====Episodes====
===&quot;Prodigy&quot;===
In the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;, the crew of the USS &quot;Protostar&quot; wind up in the mirror universe after an interphasic rift splits the USS &quot;Voyager&quot;-A into a number of alternate realities.

==Appearances in other media==
In addition to the television episodes, a number of ancillary tie-in works make use of the Mirror Universe setting. These works may contradict continuity as established in the television episodes, and are not considered canon.

===Novels===

====&quot;Star Trek: Stargazer&quot;====
The &quot;Star Trek: Stargazer&quot; novel &quot;Three&quot; by Michael Jan Friedman features the Mirror Universe.

====&quot;Dark Mirror&quot;====
The &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; book &quot;Dark Mirror&quot;, written by Diane Duane, offers another explanation of what happened after Captain Kirk and three of his crew encountered the Mirror Universe. In the novel, the Empire is still in existence in the 24th century. The point of divergence initially appears to be the Eugenics Wars where the genetic supermen were not defeated and eventually turned on each other resulting in atomic war, but works dating back to the days of ancient Greece supporting the Empire&#x27;s current mindset are noted.

====Shatnerverse====

Various novels have been set in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; version of the Mirror Universe, including a trilogy by William Shatner, which reveals the Mirror Kirk (or &quot;Emperor Tiberius&quot; as he calls himself) is still alive and plotting to reconquer the Empire.

====&quot;Star Trek: Mirror Universe&quot;====
Two collections of Mirror Universe stories were published in 2007: the first, &quot;Glass Empires&quot;, involves Mirror &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;TOS&quot; and &quot;TNG&quot; and the second, &quot;Obsidian Alliances&quot;, features Mirror &quot;DS9&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;New Frontier&quot;. &quot;The Sorrows of Empire&quot;, a novel-length expansion of David Mack&#x27;s story of the same name in &quot;Glass Empires&quot;, was published in 2009. 

A third collection, &quot;Shards and Shadows&quot;, was released in January 2009. The Mirror Universe storyline was concluded in the novel &quot;Rise Like Lions&quot;, released in November 2011. A further story taking place in the Mirror Universe, &quot;Section 31 - Disavowed&quot;, was released in October 2014.

===Games===
A number of &quot;Star Trek&quot; games take place in the Mirror Universe or reference it. Among them, the first-person shooter &quot;Star Trek: Voyager – Elite Force&quot;, the massively multiplayer online game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, the battle simulator &quot;Star Trek: Shattered Universe&quot; which is entirely set in the Mirror Universe, Decipher&#x27;s Star Trek Roleplaying Game and &quot;Star Trek: Attack Wing&quot;.

===Comics===

The concept of a morally inverted universe had been pioneered by DC Comics in 1964, three years before &quot;Star Trek&quot; adopted the idea, in the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; story &quot;Crisis on Earth-Three&quot; written by Gardner Fox.
&quot;The Mirror Universe Saga&quot; is a trade paperback that reprints eight issues of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic book (issues #9-16) chronicling an encounter between the Mirror Universe and the Prime Universe. It is set immediately after the events of &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;. The series was written by Mike W. Barr and drawn by Tom Sutton &amp; Ricardo Villagrán. This version postulates the divergence of history to start at the time of the Earth-Romulan War, with the conquest of Earth by the Romulans; after Earth&#x27;s liberation, the resistance became an empire-building government.

From 2017 to 2018, IDW Publishing published three limited series set in the Mirror Universe: &quot;Mirror Broken&quot; (2017), &quot;Through the Mirror&quot; (2018), and &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; (2018). These series focused on Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the ISS Enterprise. A new limited series, entitled &quot;Mirror War&quot;, was first published in 2021. It follows Picard&#x27;s ongoing galactic conquest which draws the attention of the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance.

===Web series===
The fan-produced web series &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot; included an episode set in the Mirror Universe called &quot;Fairest of Them All&quot;.

<text>Tasman District () is a local government district in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand. It borders the Canterbury Region, West Coast Region, Marlborough Region and Nelson City. It is administered by the Tasman District Council, a unitary authority, which sits at Richmond, with community boards serving outlying communities in Motueka and Golden Bay / Mohua. The city of Nelson has its own unitary authority separate from Tasman District, and together they comprise a single region in some contexts, but not for local government functions or resource management (planning) functions.

==Name==

Tasman Bay, the largest indentation in the north coast of the South Island, was named after Dutch seafarer, explorer and merchant Abel Tasman. He was the first European to discover New Zealand on 13 December 1642 while on an expedition for the Dutch East India Company. Tasman Bay passed the name on to the adjoining district, which was formed in 1989 largely from the merger of Waimea and Golden Bay counties.

==History==
According to tradition, the Māori waka &quot;Uruao&quot; brought ancestors of the Waitaha people to Tasman Bay in the 12th century. Archaeological evidence suggests that early Māori settlers explored the region thoroughly, settling mainly along the coast where there was ample food.

The succession of tribes into the area suggests considerable warfare interrupted the settlement process. Around 1828, Ngāti Toa (under Te Rauparaha) and the allied northern tribes of Ngāti Rārua and Ngāti Tama started their invasion of the South Island. They took over much of the area from Farewell Spit to the Wairau River.

British immigrant ships from England arrived in Nelson in 1842 and European settlement of the region began under the leadership of Captain Arthur Wakefield. From 1853 to 1876, the area of the present-day Tasman District formed part of Nelson Province.

In the 1850s, agriculture and pastoral farming started and villages developed on the Waimea Plains and at Motueka. In 1856, the discovery of gold near Collingwood sparked New Zealand&#x27;s first gold rush. Significant reserves of iron ore were found at Onekaka, where an ironworks operated during the 1920s and 1930s.

Fruit-growing started at the end of the 19th century. By 1945, it was making a significant contribution to the local economy, and that importance continues today.

As an administrative unit of local government, the Tasman District formed on 1 November 1989 within the Nelson-Marlborough Region. The Tasman District Council became a unitary authority on 1 July 1992.

==Geography==

Tasman District is a large area at the western corner of the north end of the South Island of New Zealand. It covers 9,616 square kilometres and is bounded on the west by the Matiri Ranges, Tasman Mountains and the Tasman Sea.

To the north, Tasman and Golden Bays form its seaward edge, and the eastern boundary extends to the edge of Nelson city, and includes part of the Spenser Mountains and the Saint Arnaud and Richmond Ranges. The Victoria Ranges form Tasman&#x27;s southern boundary and the district&#x27;s highest point is Mount Franklin, at 2,340 metres.

The landscape is diverse, from large mountainous areas to valleys and plains, and is sliced by such major rivers as the Buller, Motueka, Aorere, Tākaka and Wairoa. The limestone-rich area around Mount Owen and Mount Arthur is notable for its extensive cave networks, among them New Zealand&#x27;s deepest caves at Ellis Basin and Nettlebed. There is abundant bush and bird life, golden sand beaches, the unique 40-kilometre sands of Farewell Spit, and good fishing in the bays and rivers. These assets make the district a popular destination for tourists.

Tasman is home to three national parks: Abel Tasman National Park (New Zealand&#x27;s smallest at 225.41 km2), Nelson Lakes National Park (1,017.53 km2) and Kahurangi National Park (4,520 km2).

The Maruia Falls, southwest of Murchison, were created by the 1929 Murchison earthquake when a slip blocked the original channel.

<text>In the United States, tourism is a large industry that serves millions of international and domestic tourists yearly. Foreigners visit the U.S. to see natural wonders, cities, historic landmarks, and entertainment venues. Americans seek similar attractions, as well as recreation and vacation areas.

Tourism in the United States grew rapidly in the form of urban tourism during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By the 1850s, tourism in the United States was well established both as a cultural activity and as an industry. New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, all major U.S. cities, attracted numerous tourists since the 1890s. By 1915, city touring had marked significant shifts in the way Americans perceived, organized, and moved.

During the early 20th century, many more people started to travel, partly because of the spread of the automobile. Similarly air travel revolutionized travel during 1945–1969, contributing greatly to tourism in the United States. Purchases of travel and tourism-related goods and services by international visitors traveling in the United States totaled $10.9 billion during February 2013.

The travel and tourism industries in the United States were among the first economic sectors negatively affected by the September 11 attacks.

In the U.S., tourism is among the three largest employers in 29 states, employing 7.3 million in 2004, to take care of 1.19 billion trips tourists took in the U.S. in 2005. As of 2007, there are 2,462 registered National Historic Landmarks (NHL) recognized by the United States government. As of 2018, New York City is the most visited destination in the United States, followed by Los Angeles, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Chicago.

Tourists spend more money in the United States than in any other country, but the United States attracts only the third-highest number of tourists, after France and Spain. The discrepancy may be explained by longer stays in the US.

== 19th century ==
The rise of urban tourism in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries represented a major cultural transformation concerning urban space and leisure natural activity and as an industry. Package tours did not exist until the 1870s and 1880s, when entrepreneurs of various sorts from hotel keepers and agents for railroad lines to artists and writers recognized the profit to be gained from the prospering tourism industry. The rise of locomotive steam-powered trains during the 1800s enabled tourists to travel more easily and quickly.

In the United States, of rail track had been completed by 1840, by 1860 all major eastern US cities were linked by rail, and by 1869 the first trans-American railroad link was completed. Yosemite Park was developed as a tourist attraction in the late 1850s and early 1860s for an audience who wanted a national icon and place to symbolize exotic wonder of its region. Photography played an important role for the first time in the development of tourist attractions, making it possible to distribute hundreds of images showing various places of interest.

New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco were all attracting numerous tourists by the 1890s. New York&#x27;s population grew from 300,000 in 1840 to 800,000 in 1850. Chicago experienced a dramatic increase from 4,000 residents in 1840 to 300,000 by 1870. Dictionaries first published the word &#x27;tourist&#x27; sometime in 1800, when it referred to those going to Europe or making a round trip of natural wonders in New York and New England. There was not much urban tourism during the 19th century, perhaps because American cities lacked the architecture and art which attracted thousands to Europe. American cities tended to offend the sensitive with ugliness and commercialism rather than inspire awe or aesthetic pleasure. Some tourists were fascinated by the rapid growth of the new urban areas: &quot;It is an absorbing thing to watch the process of world-making; both the formation of the natural and the conventional world,&quot; wrote English writer Harriet Martineau in 1837.
As American cities developed, new institutions to accommodate and care for the insane, disabled and criminal were constructed. The Hartford, Connecticut American School for the Deaf opened in 1817, Ossining, New York state prison (now known as Sing Sing) in 1825, the Connecticut State Penitentiary at Wethersfield in 1827, Mount Auburn Cemetery in 1831, the Perkins School for the Blind in 1832, and the Worcester State Hospital in 1833. These institutions attracted the curiosity of American and foreign visitors. The English writer and actress Fanny Kemble, an admirer of the American prison system, was also concerned that nature was being destroyed in favor of new developments. Guidebooks published in the 1830s, 40s and 50s described new prisons, asylums and institutions for the deaf and blind, and urged tourists to visit these sights.

Accounts of these visits written by Charles Dickens, Harriet Martineau, Lydia Sigourney and Caroline Gilman were published in magazines and travel books. Sigourney&#x27;s &quot;Scenes in My Native Land&quot; (1845) included descriptions of her tour of Niagara Falls and other places of scenic interest with accounts of her visits to prisons and asylums. Many visited these institutions because nothing like them had existed before. The buildings which housed them were themselves monumental, often placed on hilltops as a symbol of accomplishment.

== Early tourism ==

By 1915, city touring had marked significant shifts in the way Americans perceived, organized and moved around in urban environments. Urban tourism became a profitable industry in 1915 as the number of tour agencies, railroad passenger departments, guidebook publishers and travel writers grew at a fast pace. The expense of pleasure tours between 1850 and 1915 meant that only a minority of Americans could experience the luxury of tourism. Many Americans traveled to find work, but few found time for enjoyment of the urban environment. As transportation networks improved, the length of commuting decreased, and income rose. A growing number of Americans were able to afford short vacations by 1915. Still, mass tourism was not possible until after World War II.

During the 19th century, tourism of any form had been available only to the upper and middle classes. This changed during the early 20th century. In 1895, popular publications printed articles showing the car was cheaper to operate than the horse. The development of automobiles in the early 1900s included the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908. In 1900, 8,000 cars were registered in the US, but this had increased to 619,000 by 1911. By the time of the Model T&#x27;s introduction in 1908, there were 44 US households per car. Early cars were a luxury for the wealthy, but after Ford began to dramatically drop prices after 1913, more were able to afford one.

The development of hotels with leisure complexes had become popular in the U.S. during the 1930s. The range of club type holidays available appealed to a broad segment of the holiday market. As more families traveled independently by car, hotels failed to cater to their needs. Kemmons Wilson opened the first motel as a new form of accommodation in Memphis, Tennessee in 1952.

Although thousands of tourists visited Florida during the early 1900s, it was not until after World War II that the tourist industry quickly became Florida&#x27;s largest source of income. Florida&#x27;s white sandy beaches, warm winter temperatures and wide range of activities such as swimming, fishing, boating and hiking all attracted tourists to the state. During the 1930s, architects designed Art Deco style buildings in Miami Beach. Visitors are still attracted to the Art Deco district of Miami. Theme parks were soon built across Florida. One of the largest resorts in the world, Walt Disney World Resort, was opened near Orlando, Florida in 1971. In its first year, the park added $14 billion to Orlando&#x27;s economy.

== Late 20th century ==

The revolution of air travel between 1945 and 1969 contributed greatly to tourism in the United States. In that quarter century, commercial aviation evolved from 28-passenger airliners flying at less than to 150-passenger jetliners cruising continents at . During this time, air travel in the U.S. evolved from a novelty into a routine for business travelers and vacationers alike. Rapid developments in aviation technology, economic prosperity in the United States and the demand for air travel all contributed to the early beginnings of commercial aviation in the US.

During the first four decades of the 20th century, long-haul journeys between large American cities were accomplished using trains. By the 1950s, air travel was part of everyday life for many Americans. This was also helped by the establishment of the Interstate Highway System as well as the reliance of automobiles of which Americans saw cars as their new personal found freedom and enjoyment. The tourism industry in the U.S. experienced exponential growth as tourists could travel almost anywhere with a fast, reliable and routine system. For some, a vacation in Hawaii was now a more frequent pleasure. Air travel changed everything from family vacations to Major League Baseball, as had steam-powered trains in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

By the end of the twentieth century, tourism had significantly grown throughout the world. The World Tourism Organisation (WTO, 1998) recorded that, in 1950, arrivals of tourists from abroad, excluding same-day visits, numbered about 25.2 million. By 1997, the figure was 612.8 million. In 1950 receipts from international movements were US$ 2.1 billion, in 1997 they were $443.7 billion.

It was also during the late 20th century that individual states began to adopt their own tourism slogans, with the aim to increase both domestic and international visitors. Some of these slogans have become iconic to the state itself, such as Michigan&#x27;s &quot;Pure Michigan&quot; campaign, New York&#x27;s &quot;I Love New York&quot; merchandise, and Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Virginia is for Lovers&quot; slogan. Other states adopted slogans based on civilian submissions, such as Pennsylvania holding the &quot;Penn a Phrase&quot; contest, in which the slogan &quot;Pursue Your Happiness&quot; was ultimately selected. Some slogans became the targets of campaigns to rename them launched by state residents, such as a failed 2013 campaign to change Kentucky&#x27;s slogan from &quot;Unbridled Spirit&quot; to &quot;Kentucky Kicks Ass&quot;.

== 21st century ==
The travel and tourism industry in the U.S. was among the first commercial casualties of the September 11 attacks, a series of terrorist attacks on the U.S. Terrorists used four commercial airliners as weapons of destruction, all of which were destroyed in the attacks on New York City, Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania with nearly 3,000 deaths. In the first full week after flights resumed, passenger numbers fell by nearly 45 percent, from 9 million in the week before September 11 to 5 million. Hotels and travel agencies received cancellations across the world. The hotel industry suffered an estimated $700 million loss in revenue during the four days following the attacks. The situation recovered over the following months as the Federal Reserve kept the financial system afloat. The U.S. Congress issued a $5 billion grant to the nation&#x27;s airlines and $10 billion in loan guarantees to keep them flying.

In the U.S., tourism is either the first, second, or third largest employer in 29 states, employing 7.3 million in 2004, to take care of 1.19 billion trips tourists took in the U.S. in 2005. The U.S. outbound holiday market is sensitive in the short term, but possibly one of the most surprising results from the September 11, 2001 attacks was that by February 2002 it had bounced back. This quick revival was generally quicker than many commentators had predicted only five months earlier.

The United States economy began to slow significantly in 2007, mostly because of a real-estate slump, gas prices and related financial problems. Many economists believe that the economy entered a recession at the end of 2007 or early in 2008. Some state budgets for tourism marketing have decreased, such as Connecticut which is facing soaring gas prices.

100 million tourists visited Florida in 2015, a record for the nation.

== Attractions ==

There exist a broad range of tourist attractions in the United States such as amusement parks, festivals, gambling, golf courses, historical buildings and landmarks, hotels, museums, galleries, outdoor recreation, spas, restaurants and sports.

== Travel warnings ==
In August 2019, after various mass shootings in the U.S., Amnesty International and some countries issued a travel warning.

== Visitor statistics ==
The highest numbers of non-immigrant admissions into the United States for tourists and for business purposes in were from the following countries:

<doc id="577097" wikidata="Q934791" url="?curid=577097" title="Quadtree">
<text>A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of octrees and are most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. The data associated with a leaf cell varies by application, but the leaf cell represents a &quot;unit of interesting spatial information&quot;.

The subdivided regions may be square or rectangular, or may have arbitrary shapes. This data structure was named a quadtree by Raphael Finkel and J.L. Bentley in 1974. A similar partitioning is also known as a &quot;Q-tree&quot;. 

All forms of quadtrees share some common features:
* They decompose space into adaptable cells.
* Each cell (or bucket) has a maximum capacity. When maximum capacity is reached, the bucket splits.
* The tree directory follows the spatial decomposition of the quadtree.

A tree-pyramid (T-pyramid) is a &quot;complete&quot; tree; every node of the T-pyramid has four child nodes except leaf nodes; all leaves are on the same level, the level that corresponds to individual pixels in the image. The data in a tree-pyramid can be stored compactly in an array as an implicit data structure similar to the way a complete binary tree can be stored compactly in an array.

==Types==

Quadtrees may be classified according to the type of data they represent, including areas, points, lines and curves. Quadtrees may also be classified by whether the shape of the tree is independent of the order in which data is processed. The following are common types of quadtrees.

===Region quadtree===
The region quadtree represents a partition of space in two dimensions by decomposing the region into four equal quadrants, subquadrants, and so on with each leaf node containing data corresponding to a specific subregion. Each node in the tree either has exactly four children, or has no children (a leaf node). The height of quadtrees that follow this decomposition strategy (i.e. subdividing subquadrants as long as there is interesting data in the subquadrant for which more refinement is desired) is sensitive to and dependent on the spatial distribution of interesting areas in the space being decomposed. The region quadtree is a type of trie.

A region quadtree with a depth of n may be used to represent an image consisting of 2n × 2n pixels, where each pixel value is 0 or 1. The root node represents the entire image region. If the pixels in any region are not entirely 0s or 1s, it is subdivided. In this application, each leaf node represents a block of pixels that are all 0s or all 1s. Note the potential savings in terms of space when these trees are used for storing images; images often have many regions of considerable size that have the same colour value throughout. Rather than store a big 2-D array of every pixel in the image, a quadtree can capture the same information potentially many divisive levels higher than the pixel-resolution sized cells that we would otherwise require. The tree resolution and overall size is bounded by the pixel and image sizes.

A region quadtree may also be used as a variable resolution representation of a data field. For example, the temperatures in an area may be stored as a quadtree, with each leaf node storing the average temperature over the subregion it represents.

===Point quadtree===
The point quadtree is an adaptation of a binary tree used to represent two-dimensional point data. It shares the features of all quadtrees but is a true tree as the center of a subdivision is always on a point. It is often very efficient in comparing two-dimensional, ordered data points, usually operating in O(log n) time. Point quadtrees are worth mentioning for completeness, but they have been surpassed by &quot;k&quot;-d trees as tools for generalized binary search.

Point quadtrees are constructed as follows. Given the next point to insert, we find the cell in which it lies and add it to the tree. The new point is added such that the cell that contains it is divided into quadrants by the vertical and horizontal lines that run through the point. Consequently, cells are rectangular but not necessarily square. In these trees, each node contains one of the input points.

Since the division of the plane is decided by the order of point-insertion, the tree&#x27;s height is sensitive to and dependent on insertion order. Inserting in a &quot;bad&quot; order can lead to a tree of height linear in the number of input points (at which point it becomes a linked-list). If the point-set is static, pre-processing can be done to create a tree of balanced height.

====Node structure for a point quadtree====
A node of a point quadtree is similar to a node of a binary tree, with the major difference being that it has four pointers (one for each quadrant) instead of two (&quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;) as in an ordinary binary tree. Also a key is usually decomposed into two parts, referring to x and y coordinates. Therefore, a node contains the following information:
* four pointers: quad[‘NW’], quad[‘NE’], quad[‘SW’], and quad[‘SE’]
* point; which in turn contains:
** key; usually expressed as x, y coordinates
** value; for example a name

===Point-region (PR) quadtree===
Point-region (PR) quadtrees are very similar to region quadtrees. The difference is the type of information stored about the cells. In a region quadtree, a uniform value is stored that applies to the entire area of the cell of a leaf. The cells of a PR quadtree, however, store a list of points that exist within the cell of a leaf. As mentioned previously, for trees following this decomposition strategy the height depends on the spatial distribution of the points. Like the point quadtree, the PR quadtree may also have a linear height when given a &quot;bad&quot; set.

===Edge quadtree===
Edge quadtrees (much like PM quadtrees) are used to store lines rather than points. Curves are approximated by subdividing cells to a very fine resolution, specifically until there is a single line segment per cell. Near corners/vertices, edge quadtrees will continue dividing until they reach their maximum level of decomposition. This can result in extremely unbalanced trees which may defeat the purpose of indexing.

===Polygonal map (PM) quadtree===
The polygonal map quadtree (or PM Quadtree) is a variation of quadtree which is used to store collections of polygons that may be degenerate (meaning that they have isolated vertices or edges).
 A big difference between PM quadtrees and edge quadtrees is that the cell under consideration is not subdivided if the segments meet at a vertex in the cell.

There are three main classes of PM Quadtrees, which vary depending on what information they store within each black node. PM3 quadtrees can store any amount of non-intersecting edges and at most one point. PM2 quadtrees are the same as PM3 quadtrees except that all edges must share the same end point. Finally PM1 quadtrees are similar to PM2, but black nodes can contain a point and its edges or just a set of edges that share a point, but you cannot have a point and a set of edges that do not contain the point.

===Compressed quadtrees===
This section summarizes a subsection from a book by Sariel Har-Peled.

If we were to store every node corresponding to a subdivided cell, we may end up storing a lot of empty nodes. We can cut down on the size of such sparse trees by only storing subtrees whose leaves have interesting data (i.e. &quot;important subtrees&quot;). We can actually cut down on the size even further. When we only keep important subtrees, the pruning process may leave long paths in the tree where the intermediate nodes have degree two (a link to one parent and one child). It turns out that we only need to store the node formula_1 at the beginning of this path (and associate some meta-data with it to represent the removed nodes) and attach the subtree rooted at its end to formula_1. It is still possible for these compressed trees to have a linear height when given &quot;bad&quot; input points.

Although we trim a lot of the tree when we perform this compression, it is still possible to achieve logarithmic-time search, insertion, and deletion by taking advantage of &quot;Z&quot;-order curves. The &quot;Z&quot;-order curve maps each cell of the full quadtree (and hence even the compressed quadtree) in formula_3 time to a one-dimensional line (and maps it back in formula_3 time too), creating a total order on the elements. Therefore, we can store the quadtree in a data structure for ordered sets (in which we store the nodes of the tree). 

We must state a reasonable assumption before we continue: we assume that given two real numbers formula_5 expressed as binary, we can compute in formula_3 time the index of the first bit in which they differ. We also assume that we can compute in formula_3 time the lowest common ancestor of two points/cells in the quadtree and establish their relative &quot;Z&quot;-ordering, and we can compute the floor function in formula_3 time. 

With these assumptions, point location of a given point formula_9 (i.e. determining the cell that would contain formula_9), insertion, and deletion operations can all be performed in formula_11 time (i.e. the time it takes to do a search in the underlying ordered set data structure).

To perform a point location for formula_9 (i.e. find its cell in the compressed tree):
# Find the existing cell in the compressed tree that comes before formula_9 in the &quot;Z&quot;-order. Call this cell formula_14.
# If formula_15, return formula_14.
# Else, find what would have been the lowest common ancestor of the point formula_9 and the cell formula_14 in an uncompressed quadtree. Call this ancestor cell formula_1.
# Find the existing cell in the compressed tree that comes before formula_1 in the &quot;Z&quot;-order and return it.
Without going into specific details, to perform insertions and deletions we first do a point location for the thing we want to insert/delete, and then insert/delete it. Care must be taken to reshape the tree as appropriate, creating and removing nodes as needed.

==Some common uses of quadtrees==

* Image representation
* Image processing
* Mesh generation

* Conway&#x27;s Game of Life simulation program.
* State estimation
* Quadtrees are also used in the area of fractal image analysis
* Maximum disjoint sets

==Image processing using quadtrees==
Quadtrees, particularly the region quadtree, have lent themselves well to image processing applications. We will limit our discussion to binary image data, though region quadtrees and the image processing operations performed on them are just as suitable for colour images.

===Image union / intersection===
One of the advantages of using quadtrees for image manipulation is that the set operations of union and intersection can be done simply and quickly.

Given two binary images, the image union (also called &quot;overlay&quot;) produces an image wherein a pixel is black if either of the input images has a black pixel in the same location. That is, a pixel in the output image is white only when the corresponding pixel in &quot;both&quot; input images is white, otherwise the output pixel is black. Rather than do the operation pixel by pixel, we can compute the union more efficiently by leveraging the quadtree&#x27;s ability to represent multiple pixels with a single node. For the purposes of discussion below, if a subtree contains both black and white pixels we will say that the root of that subtree is coloured grey.

The algorithm works by traversing the two input quadtrees (formula_21 and formula_22) while building the output quadtree formula_23. Informally, the algorithm is as follows. Consider the nodes formula_24 and formula_25 corresponding to the same region in the images.
* If formula_26 or formula_27 is black, the corresponding node is created in formula_23 and is colored black. If only one of them is black and the other is gray, the gray node will contain a subtree underneath. This subtree need not be traversed.
* If formula_26 (respectively, formula_27) is white, formula_27 (respectively, formula_26) and the subtree underneath it (if any) is copied to formula_23 .
* If both formula_26 and formula_27 are gray, then the corresponding children of formula_26 and formula_27 are considered.

While this algorithm works, it does not by itself guarantee a minimally sized quadtree. For example, consider the result if we were to union a checkerboard (where every tile is a pixel) of size formula_38 with its complement. The result is a giant black square which should be represented by a quadtree with just the root node (coloured black), but instead the algorithm produces a full 4-ary tree of depth formula_39. To fix this, we perform a bottom-up traversal of the resulting quadtree where we check if the four children nodes have the same colour, in which case we replace their parent with a leaf of the same colour.

The intersection of two images is almost the same algorithm. One way to think about the intersection of the two images is that we are doing a union with respect to the &quot;white&quot; pixels. As such, to perform the intersection we swap the mentions of black and white in the union algorithm.

===Connected component labelling===
Consider two neighbouring black pixels in a binary image. They are &quot;adjacent&quot; if they share a bounding horizontal or vertical edge. In general, two black pixels are &quot;connected&quot; if one can be reached from the other by moving only to adjacent pixels (i.e. there is a path of black pixels between them where each consecutive pair is adjacent). Each maximal set of connected black pixels is a &quot;connected component&quot;. Using the quadtree representation of images, Samet showed how we can find and label these connected components in time proportional to the size of the quadtree. This algorithm can also be used for polygon colouring.

The algorithm works in three steps: 
# establish the adjacency relationships between black pixels 
# process the equivalence relations from the first step to obtain one unique label for each connected component 
# label the black pixels with the label associated with their connected component
To simplify the discussion, let us assume the children of a node in the quadtree follow the &quot;Z&quot;-order (SW, NW, SE, NE). Since we can count on this structure, for any cell we know how to navigate the quadtree to find the adjacent cells in the different levels of the hierarchy.

Step one is accomplished with a post-order traversal of the quadtree. For each black leaf formula_14 we look at the node or nodes representing cells that are Northern neighbours and Eastern neighbours (i.e. the Northern and Eastern cells that share edges with the cell of formula_14). Since the tree is organized in &quot;Z&quot;-order, we have the invariant that the Southern and Western neighbours have already been taken care of and accounted for. Let the Northern or Eastern neighbour currently under consideration be formula_1. If formula_1 represents black pixels:
* If only one of formula_1 or formula_14 has a label, assign that label to the other cell
* If neither of them have labels, create one and assign it to both of them
* If formula_1 and formula_14 have different labels, record this label equivalence and move on
Step two can be accomplished using the union-find data structure. We start with each unique label as a separate set. For every equivalence relation noted in the first step, we union the corresponding sets. Afterwards, each distinct remaining set will be associated with a distinct connected component in the image.

Step three performs another post-order traversal. This time, for each black node formula_14 we use the union-find&#x27;s &quot;find&quot; operation (with the old label of formula_14) to find and assign formula_14 its new label (associated with the connected component of which formula_14 is part).

==Mesh generation using quadtrees==
This section summarizes a chapter from a book by Har-Peled and de Berg et al.

Mesh generation is essentially the triangulation of a point set for which further processing may be performed. As such, it is desirable for the resulting triangulation to have certain properties (like non-uniformity, triangles that are not &quot;too skinny&quot;, large triangles in sparse areas and small triangles in dense ones, etc.) to make further processing quicker and less error-prone. Quadtrees built on the point set can be used to create meshes with these desired properties.

Consider a leaf of the quadtree and its corresponding cell formula_14. We say formula_14 is &quot;balanced&quot; (for mesh generation) if the cell&#x27;s sides are intersected by the corner points of neighbouring cells at most once on each side. This means that the quadtree levels of leaves adjacent to formula_14 differ by at most one from the level of formula_14. When this is true for all leaves, we say the whole quadtree is balanced (for mesh generation).

Consider the cell formula_14 and the formula_57 neighbourhood of same-sized cells centred at formula_14. We call this neighbourhood the &quot;extended cluster&quot;. We say the quadtree is &quot;well-balanced&quot; if it is balanced, and for every leaf formula_1 that contains a point of the point set, its extended cluster is also in the quadtree and the extended cluster contains no other point of the point set.

Creating the mesh is done as follows:
# Build a quadtree on the input points.
# Ensure the quadtree is balanced. For every leaf, if there is a neighbour that is too large, subdivide the neighbour. This is repeated until the tree is balanced. We also make sure that for a leaf with a point in it, the nodes for each leaf&#x27;s extended cluster are in the tree.
# For every leaf node formula_14 that contains a point, if the extended cluster contains another point, we further subdivide the tree and rebalance as necessary. If we needed to subdivide, for each child formula_1 of formula_14 we ensure the nodes of formula_1&#x27;s extended cluster are in the tree (and re-balance as required).
# Repeat the previous step until the tree is well-balanced.
# Transform the quadtree into a triangulation.
We consider the corner points of the tree cells as vertices in our triangulation. Before the transformation step we have a bunch of boxes with points in some of them. The transformation step is done in the following manner: for each point, warp the closest corner of its cell to meet it and triangulate the resulting four quadrangles to make &quot;nice&quot; triangles (the interested reader is referred to chapter 12 of Har-Peled for more details on what makes &quot;nice&quot; triangles).

The remaining squares are triangulated according to some simple rules. For each regular square (no points within and no corner points in its sides), introduce the diagonal. Due to the way in which we separated points with the well-balancing property, no square with a corner intersecting a side is one that was warped. As such, we can triangulate squares with intersecting corners as follows. If there is one intersected side, the square becomes three triangles by adding the long diagonals connecting the intersection with opposite corners. If there are four intersected sides, we split the square in half by adding an edge between two of the four intersections, and then connect these two endpoints to the remaining two intersection points. For the other squares, we introduce a point in the middle and connect it to all four corners of the square as well as each intersection point.

At the end of it all, we have a nice triangulated mesh of our point set built from a quadtree.

==Pseudocode==
The following pseudo code shows one means of implementing a quadtree which handles only points. There are other approaches available.

===Prerequisites===
It is assumed these structures are used.

 // Simple coordinate object to represent points and vectors
 struct XY
 float x;
 float y;
 function __construct(float _x, float _y) {...}
 
 // Axis-aligned bounding box with half dimension and center
 struct AABB
 XY center;
 float halfDimension;
 function __construct(XY _center, float _halfDimension) {...}
 function containsPoint(XY point) {...}
 function intersectsAABB(AABB other) {...}


===QuadTree class===
This class represents both one quad tree and the node where it is rooted.

 class QuadTree
 // Arbitrary constant to indicate how many elements can be stored in this quad tree node
 constant int QT_NODE_CAPACITY = 4;
 // Axis-aligned bounding box stored as a center with half-dimensions
 // to represent the boundaries of this quad tree
 AABB boundary;
 // Points in this quad tree node
 Array of XY [size = QT_NODE_CAPACITY] points;
 // Children
 QuadTree* northWest;
 QuadTree* northEast;
 QuadTree* southWest;
 QuadTree* southEast;
 // Methods
 function __construct(AABB _boundary) {...}
 function insert(XY p) {...}
 function subdivide() {...} // create four children that fully divide this quad into four quads of equal area
 function queryRange(AABB range) {...}

===Insertion===
The following method inserts a point into the appropriate quad of a quadtree, splitting if necessary.
 class QuadTree
 ...
 // Insert a point into the QuadTree
 function insert(XY p)
 // Ignore objects that do not belong in this quad tree
 if (!boundary.containsPoint(p))
 return false; // object cannot be added
 // If there is space in this quad tree and if doesn&#x27;t have subdivisions, add the object here
 if (points.size &lt; QT_NODE_CAPACITY &amp;&amp; northWest == null)
 points.append(p);
 return true;
 
 // Otherwise, subdivide and then add the point to whichever node will accept it
 if (northWest == null)
 subdivide();
 // We have to add the points/data contained in this quad array to the new quads if we only want
 // the last node to hold the data
 if (northWest-&gt;insert(p)) return true;
 if (northEast-&gt;insert(p)) return true;
 if (southWest-&gt;insert(p)) return true;
 if (southEast-&gt;insert(p)) return true;
 // Otherwise, the point cannot be inserted for some unknown reason (this should never happen)
 return false;
 }
===Query range===
The following method finds all points contained within a range.

 class QuadTree
 ...
 // Find all points that appear within a range
 function queryRange(AABB range)
 // Prepare an array of results
 Array of XY pointsInRange;
 // Automatically abort if the range does not intersect this quad
 if (!boundary.intersectsAABB(range))
 return pointsInRange; // empty list
 // Check objects at this quad level
 for (int p = 0; p &lt; points.size; p++)
 if (range.containsPoint(points[p]))
 pointsInRange.append(points[p]);
 
 // Terminate here, if there are no children
 if (northWest == null)
 return pointsInRange;
 // Otherwise, add the points from the children
 pointsInRange.appendArray(northWest-&gt;queryRange(range));
 pointsInRange.appendArray(northEast-&gt;queryRange(range));
 pointsInRange.appendArray(southWest-&gt;queryRange(range));
 pointsInRange.appendArray(southEast-&gt;queryRange(range));
 return pointsInRange;
 }

The Free Software Award for Projects of Social Benefit is an annual award granted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In announcing the award, the FSF explained that:

<text>L Peter Deutsch (born Laurence Peter Deutsch on August 7, 1946, in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American computer scientist and composer. He is the founder of Aladdin Enterprises and creator of Ghostscript, a free software PostScript and PDF interpreter.

Deutsch&#x27;s other work includes the Smalltalk implementation that inspired Java just-in-time compilation technology about 15 years later.

== Name ==
Deutsch changed his legal first name from &quot;Laurence&quot; to &quot;L&quot; on September 12, 2007. His published work and other public references before that time generally use the name &quot;L. Peter Deutsch&quot; (with a dot after the &quot;L&quot;).

==Early life==
Deutsch&#x27;s father was the physicist Martin Deutsch, a professor at MIT.

==Contributions to computer science==
Deutsch wrote the PDP-1 Lisp 1.5 implementation and first REPL, Basic PDP-1 LISP, &quot;while still in short pants&quot; and finished it in 1963, when he was 17 years old. He collaborated with Calvin Mooers on the TRAC programming language and wrote its first implementation, on the PDP-1, in 1964.

From 1964 to 1967, during his study at the University of California, Berkeley, he worked with Butler Lampson and Charles P. Thacker on the Berkeley Timesharing System, which became the standard operating system for the SDS 940 mainframe that would later be used by Tymshare, NLS, and Community Memory.

Deutsch is the author of several Request for Comments (RFCs), The Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing, and originated the Deutsch limit adage about visual programming languages.

Deutsch received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1973, and has previously worked at Xerox PARC and Sun Microsystems. In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.

== Composer ==
After auditing undergraduate music courses at Stanford University, in January 2009, he entered the postgraduate music program at California State University, East Bay, and was awarded a Master of Arts (M.A.) in March 2011. As of mid-2011, he has had six compositions performed at public concerts, and now generally identifies himself as a composer rather than a software developer or engineer.

== Literature ==
Some stories about him are included in the book &quot;&quot;. An interview with him is printed in &quot;Coders at Work&quot;.

<text>Luzzasco Luzzaschi (c. 1545 – 10 September 1607) was an Italian composer, organist, and teacher of the late Renaissance. He was born and died in Ferrara, and despite evidence of travels to Rome it is assumed that Luzzaschi spent the majority of his life in his native city. He was a skilled representative of the late Italian madrigal style, along with Palestrina, Wert, Monte, Lassus, Marenzio, Gesualdo and others.

==Biography==
As a pupil of Cipriano de Rore, Luzzaschi developed his craft and eventually came to be an influential pedagogue himself. Anthony Newcomb writes:

In 1564, Luzzaschi was appointed as principal organist to the d&#x27;Este court. His facility as a keyboard player must have been paramount, for his competence on Nicola Vicentino&#x27;s microtonal archicembalo was actively documented throughout his career.

Luzzaschi is widely remembered due to his association with the famous &quot;Concerto delle donne&quot;, a private female vocal ensemble founded by Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara. In addition to his duties as court organist, as director for the ensemble he composed expert madrigals that required virtuosic vocal skill and advanced musicianship. Expressing a highly ornamented soprano line, his famous publication, &quot;Madrigali...per cantare, et sonare, a uno, e doi, e tre soprani&quot; of 1601 contained repertory performed by this expert troupe.

==Works==
Luzzaschi&#x27;s surviving canon is limited to: seven books (1571 through 1604) of madrigals for five voices; the 1601 &quot;Madrigali per cantare et sonare a 1-3 soprani&quot;; a collection of five-part motets; and four keyboard works. While reference to three books of four-voice ricercars by Luzzaschi indicates that he was actively composing instrumental work, the books themselves appear to be lost.

<text>From 1999 to 2002, and restarted in 2010 SatireWire is a news satire website. Based in Connecticut and founded by Andrew Marlatt, the site aimed its satire at politics, business, the media, and current events, and spawned Marlatt&#x27;s 2002 book &quot;Economy of Errors&quot; (Random House), which was a parody of the rise and fall of the Internet economy and the stock market.

During its initial run, SatireWire, like its peer &quot;The Onion&quot;, was regularly nominated for the Webby Awards, and its stories were continuously emailed around the Internet, most notably a story entitled &quot;China, Libya, Syria form Axis of Just as Evil&quot; in response to President George W. Bush&#x27;s &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; speech. This story was also included in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s 2002 book &quot;Step Across This Line&quot;. Many SatireWire pieces were also published by magazines and newspapers such as the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, and the &quot;National Post&quot;. While its subjects were wide-ranging, SatireWire is perhaps best remembered for its business humor, including the 2001 story &quot;Sally Struthers Begs You to Save the Dot-Coms&quot;, written in response to the collapse of Internet stocks, &quot;Remaining U.S. CEOs Make a Break for It&quot;, about a band of roving CEOs who plunder their way to the Mexican border, and &quot;Religious Merger Creates 900 Million Hinjews&quot;.

Marlatt left SatireWire to write comedy for the BBC, among others. In January 2006, he served as a member of the judging panel for the HumorFeed Satire News Awards.

In 2010 Marlatt brought the site back and began writing new content.

<text>Gabriel Léon M&#x27;ba (9 February 1902 – 28 November 1967) was a Gabonese politician who served as both the first Prime Minister (1959–1961) and President (1961–1967) of Gabon.

A member of the Fang ethnic group, M&#x27;ba was born into a relatively privileged village family. After studying at a seminary, he held a number of small jobs before entering the colonial administration as a customs agent. His political activism in favor of black people worried the French administration, and as a punishment for his activities, he was issued a prison sentence after committing a minor crime that normally would have resulted in a small fine. In 1924, the administration gave M&#x27;ba a second chance and selected him to head the canton in Estuaire Province. After being accused of complicity in the murder of a woman near Libreville, he was sentenced in 1931 to three years in prison and 10 years in exile. While in exile in Oubangui-Chari, he published works documenting the tribal customary law of the Fang people. He was employed by local administrators, and received praise from his superiors for his work. He remained a &quot;persona non grata&quot; to Gabon until the French colonial administration finally allowed M&#x27;ba to return his native country in 1946.

After returning from exile, he began his political ascent by founding the Gabonese Mixed Committee. After his party broke ties with the French Communist Party in 1951, it was allowed to run in French Gabon elections and he was elected to the Territorial Assembly in 1952. After becoming mayor of the capital city, Libreville, in 1956, M&#x27;ba quickly rose to prominence and was appointed the vice-president of the governor&#x27;s council on 21 May 1957, the highest position held by a native African in French Gabon. In 1958, he directed an initiative to include Gabon in the Franco-African community further than before.

After independence, he served as the first Prime Minister of Gabon from 27 February 1959 until 21 February 1961. He became the first President of Gabon on 17 August 1960. Political nemesis Jean-Hilaire Aubame briefly assumed the office of president through a coup d&#x27;état in February 1964, but order was restored days later when the French intervened. M&#x27;ba was reelected in March 1967, but died of cancer in November 1967 and was succeeded by his vice president, Albert-Bernard Bongo.

==Early life==

A member of the Fang ethnic tribe, M&#x27;ba was born on 9 February 1902 in Libreville, Gabon. His father, a small business manager and village chief, once worked as the hairdresser to Franco-Italian explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. His mother, Louise Bendome, was a seamstress. Both were educated and were among the first &quot;evolved couples&quot; in Libreville. M&#x27;ba&#x27;s brother also played an important role in the colonial hierarchy; he was Gabon&#x27;s first Roman Catholic priest.

In 1909, M&#x27;ba joined a seminary to receive his primary education. From 1920, he was employed as a store manager, a lumberjack and trader before entering the French colonial administration as a customs agent. Despite his good job performance, M&#x27;ba&#x27;s activism in helping black Gabonians, particularly for the Fangs, worried his superiors. In September 1922, M&#x27;ba wrote to Edmond Cadier, Lieutenant-Governor of Gabon:

His remarks upset authorities, and he suffered the consequences in December 1922, when he was sentenced to prison after having committed a minor crime of providing a colleague with falsified documents.

==Under the colonial administration==

===&quot;Chef de canton&quot;===
In either 1924 or 1926, M&#x27;ba reconciled with colonial authorities and was chosen to succeed the deceased &quot;chef de canton&quot; (similar to a village chief) of Libreville&#x27;s Fang neighbourhood. As the leader of a group of young Libreville intellectuals, he ignored the advice of elder Fangs and quickly gained a reputation as a strong, confident, and able-minded man. He once wrote in a letter that he was &quot;[m]issioned to enforce public order and defend the general interest&quot; and that he did &quot;not accept that people transgress the orders received from the authority that I represent.&quot;

M&#x27;ba did not have an idealist vision of his job; he saw it as a way to become wealthy. With his colleague Ambamamy, he forced labour on the residents of the canton for his personal use, to cover his large expenditures. The colonial administration was aware of the embezzlement, but they chose to overlook it. However, beginning in 1929, the colonial administration started to investigate his activities after they intercepted one of his letters to a Kouyaté, secretary for the Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme, who was accused of being an ally of the Comintern. Despite this suspected Communist alliance, the French authorities did not oppose M&#x27;ba&#x27;s appointment as head chief of the Estuaire Province by his colleagues.

In those years, M&#x27;ba, a member of the Ligue, distanced himself from Roman Catholicism, but did not break completely with his faith. He instead became a follower of the Bwiti religious sect, which Fangs were particularly receptive to. He believed this would help revitalise a society which he felt had been damaged by the colonial administration. In 1931, the sect was accused of murdering a woman whose remains were discovered outside a market in Libreville. Accused of complicity, even though his involvement in the crime was not proven, M&#x27;ba was removed from power and sentenced to three years in prison and ten years of exile. Officially this was for embezzlement of tax revenues and his abusive treatment of the local labour force.

===Exile in Oubangui-Chari===

While exiled in the French territory of Oubangui-Chari, first in the towns of Bambari and then Bria, he continued to exert influence among Fangs via correspondence with his compatriots in Libreville. Worried by the situation, Governor-General Antonetti ordered in 1934, at the end of his prison sentence, that M&#x27;ba be placed under surveillance.

During his years in exile, he wrote about the customary rights of the Fang people in the &quot;Essai de droit coutumier pahouin&quot; () and published it in &quot;Bulletin de la société des recherches congolaises&quot; in 1938. This work quickly became the main reference on Fang tribal customary law. By 1939, the native ex-chief remained a &quot;persona non grata&quot; to Gabon, as stated in the letter from the head of the Estuarie Department, Assier de Pompignan:

In spite of being in exile, M&#x27;ba was employed by local administrators. Placed in secondary offices and having no proper power, he was an accomplished and valuable employee. Thanks to praiseworthy reports from his superiors, he was once again seen as a reliable indigenous element on which the colonial administration could rely on. In 1942, a sentence reduction was granted to him. Following his release, he became a civil servant in Brazzaville, where his prestige increased.

==Political ascension==

===Return to Gabon and local politician===
In 1946, M&#x27;ba returned to Gabon, where he was greeted exultantly by his friends. He was not reinstated as &quot;chef de canton&quot;; instead, he obtained an important position as store manager for the English trading house John Holt. That same year, he founded the Gabonese Mixed Committee (CMG), a political party close to the African Democratic Rally (RDA), an inter-African party led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny. The party&#x27;s main objective was to obtain autonomy for its member states and oppose the Senegalese leader Léopold Sédar Senghor&#x27;s idea of federalism. Playing on his past as a former exile, and through the network of Bwiti followers, M&#x27;ba managed to rally support from the Fang and Myènè peoples. His goal was to win indigenous administrative and judicial posts.

Based on his success in Libreville, M&#x27;ba aspired, at one point, to become the head of the region, an idea which many notable Fangs supported during the Pahouin congress at Mitzic in February 1947. However, the colonial authorities refused to give him the position. Due to his relations with the RDA, which was linked to the French Communist Party, M&#x27;Ba was seen as a communist and propagandist in the colony; for the authorities, these suspicions had been confirmed when M&#x27;ba was involved in the 1949 RDA congress in Abidjan.

In 1951, the CMG decided to break its ties with the Communists, siding with the moderate position favored by Houphouët-Boigny while he did the same. At the same time M&#x27;ba, while maintaining his &quot;rebellious&quot; image to the electorate, became close with the French administration. However, the administration was already supporting his main opponent, Congressman Jean-Hilaire Aubame, who was M&#x27;ba&#x27;s protégé and his half-brother&#x27;s foster son. In the legislative elections of 17 June 1951, Aubame was easily re-elected, as M&#x27;ba only received 3,257 votes, just 11% of the electorate. In the territorial elections of March 1952, Aubame&#x27;s Gabonese Democratic and Social Union (UDSG) won 14 of the 24 contested seats, against two for the CMG; however, the CMG received 57% of the votes cast in Libreville.

===Rise to power===

Initially rejected by the Territorial Assembly, M&#x27;ba allied himself with French representatives in the assembly. However, using his charismatic traits and his reputation as a &quot;man of the people&quot;, he managed to win a seat there in 1952.

He left the CMG to join the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG) led by Paul Gondjout in 1954, whom M&#x27;ba intended to overthrow. Gondjout, the secretary of the BDG, appointed M&#x27;ba secretary-general and formed a long term alliance against Aubame. In the legislative elections of 2 January 1956, M&#x27;ba received 36% of the votes versus 47% for Aubame. Though not elected, M&#x27;ba became the leader of the indigenous territory, and some of the UDSG began to ally themselves with him.

In the municipal elections of 1956, M&#x27;ba received support from the French logging industry, especially Roland Bru, and was elected mayor of Libreville with 65.5% of the vote. On 23 November he was appointed the first mayor of the capital. This has been cited as the BDG&#x27;s first significant victory over the UDSG. In the French practice of holding multiple posts known as &quot;cumul des positions&quot;, M&#x27;ba served as both mayor and deputy.

In the territorial elections of March 1957, his reputation as a &quot;forester&#x27;s man&quot; worked against him; the BDG finished second again, winning 16 of the 40 contested seats, against 18 for the UDSG. Bru and other French foresters bribed several UDSG deputies to switch their political party to the BDG. M&#x27;ba&#x27;s party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame&#x27;s party after a recount. However, in the absence of an absolute majority, both parties were obliged to submit on 21 May 1957, a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable for election into the government. That same day, M&#x27;ba was appointed vice president of the government council under the French governor. Soon, divisions grew within the government, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a motion of censure against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21–19 vote. With M&#x27;ba&#x27;s victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the party a majority with 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power.

After voting in favor of the Franco-African Community, similar to the British Commonwealth, in the constitutional referendum of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo-politically independent. French journalist Pierre Péan asserted that M&#x27;ba secretly tried to prevent Gabonese independence; instead, he lobbied for it to become an overseas territory of France. In December 1958, the Assembly voted to establish the legislature, and then the constitution of the Republic of Gabon on 19 February 1959. On 27 February, M&#x27;ba was appointed Prime Minister. After M&#x27;ba openly declared for the departmentalization of Gabon in November 1959, Jacques Foccart, Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s spin doctor for African policy, told him that this solution was unthinkable. M&#x27;ba then decided to adopt a new flag by affixing the design of the national tree, the Angouma, over the French flag. Again, Foccart, as a loyal Frenchman, refused.

From July 1958, a third political force tried to establish itself in Gabon: the Parti d&#x27;Union Nationale Gabonais (PUNGA), led by René-Paul Sousatte and Jean-Jacques Boucavel, created attempting to unite the southern Gabonese against the established BDG and UDSG. It was also supported by former UDSG members, &quot;radical&quot; students, and trade unionists. Though it voted against the constitutional referendum, PUNGA organised several events geared toward gaining independence and the holding of more parliamentary elections, which were also supported by the UDSG. In March 1960, after independence had already been obtained, M&#x27;ba cracked down on PUNGA, claiming its goal had already been reached. He filed an arrest warrant for Sousatte for conspiring against him and searched the houses of UDSG members, who he accused of complicity. Intimidated, three deputies of the UDSG joined the majority.

==President of Gabon==

===Consolidation of power===
On 19 June 1960, legislative elections were organised through the &quot;scrutin de liste&quot; voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and obtains all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the month before full political independence of Gabon was achieved on 13 August, M&#x27;ba signed 15 cooperation agreements with France, pertaining to national defense, technical cooperation, economic support, access to materials, and national stability. On 17 August, independence was proclaimed. However, the Prime Minister realistically declared on 12 August, &quot;We must not waste our chances by imagining that with independence, we now own a powerful fetish that will fulfill our wishes. In believing that with independence everything becomes easy and possible, there is a danger of descending into anarchy, disorder, poverty, famine.&quot;

M&#x27;ba aspired to establish a democratic regime, which, in his view, was necessary for the development and attraction of investments in Gabon. He attempted to reconcile the imperatives of democracy and the necessity for a strong and coherent government. Yet in practice, the regime showed a fundamental weakness in attaining M&#x27;ba&#x27;s goal in which he, who had by this time become known as &quot;the old man&quot;, or &quot;the boss&quot;, would have a high degree of authority. A cult of personality developed steadily around M&#x27;ba; songs were sung in his praise and stamps and loincloths were printed with his effigy. His photograph was displayed in stores and hotels across Gabon, in government buildings hung next to that of de Gaulle.

In November 1960, a crisis broke out within the majority party. After deciding to reshuffle the cabinet without consulting Parliament, the president of the National Assembly, Paul Gondjout, a previous ally of M&#x27;ba&#x27;s, filed a motion of censure. Gondjout supposedly hoped to benefit from a balance of power modified to his own advantage, and specifically sought the establishment of a strong parliament and a prime minister with executive power. M&#x27;ba, who did not share these ideas, reacted repressively. On 16 November, under the pretext of a conspiracy, he declared a state of emergency, ordering the internment of eight BDG opponents and the dissolution of the National Assembly the day after. Electors were asked to vote again on 12 February 1961. Gondjout was sentenced to two years in prison. Sousatte, who also opposed the constitution, was also sentenced to the same amount of jail time. Upon their releases, M&#x27;ba appointed Gondjout president of the economic council and Sousatte Minister of Agriculture, both mostly symbolic posts.

===&quot;Hyperprésident&quot; of Gabon===
On 4 December, M&#x27;ba was elected to replace Gondjout as Secretary General of the BDG. He turned to the opposition to strengthen his position. With Aubame, he formed a number of sufficiently balanced political unions to appeal to the electorate. On 12 February, they won 99.75% of the vote. The same day, M&#x27;ba was elected President of Gabon, being the only candidate. In thanks for his help, M&#x27;ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister to replace André Gustave Anguilé.

On 21 February 1961, a new constitution was unanimously adopted, providing for a &quot;hyperpresidential&quot; regime. M&#x27;ba now had full executive powers: he could appoint ministers whose functions and responsibilities were decided by him; he could dissolve the National Assembly by choice or prolong its term beyond the normal five years; he could declare a state of emergency when he believed the need arose, though for this amendment he would have to consult the people via a referendum. This was, in fact, very similar to the constitution adopted in favor of Fulbert Youlou at roughly the same time. A report from the French secret service summarized the situation as follows:

The new constitution and the National Union (a political union they founded) suspended the quarrels between M&#x27;ba and Aubame from 1961 to 1963. Despite this, political unrest grew within the population, and many students held demonstrations on the frequent dissolutions of the National Assembly and the general political attitude in the country. The president did not hesitate to enforce the law himself; with a chicotte, he whipped citizens who did not show respect for him, including passersby who &quot;forgot&quot; to salute him. In addition, in February 1961, he decreed the internment of approximately 20 people for these demonstrations.

On 9 February 1963, the President pardoned those arrested during the political crisis of November 1960. On 19 February, he broke his ties with Aubame; all UDSG representatives were dismissed, with the exception of M&#x27;ba supporter Francis Meye. In an attempt to oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M&#x27;ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February. Thereafter, M&#x27;ba claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with parliamentary functions. Aubame resolved the problem by resigning from his post on the Supreme Court, complicating matters for M&#x27;ba. Faced with reports of tension between the government and the National Assembly, even though 70% of it were BDG members, the Gabonese president dissolved the legislature on 21 January 1964 as an &quot;economy measure&quot;.

The electoral conditions were announced as such: The election 67 districts were reduced to 47. M&#x27;ba disqualified Aubame by announcing anyone who held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M&#x27;ba&#x27;s idea was that no party other than his would have the money to enter candidates. In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections that they did not consider fair.

===1964 Gabon coup d&#x27;état===
From the night of 17 February to the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 Gabonese military personnel, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Valére Essone, arrested President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann, French commanders Claude Haulin and Major Royer, On Radio Libreville, the military announced to the Gabonese people that a coup d&#x27;état had taken place, and that they required technical assistance and told the French not interfere in this matter. M&#x27;ba was instructed to broadcast a speech acknowledging his defeat. &quot;The D-Day is here, the injustices are beyond measure, these people are patient, but their patience has limits&quot;, he said. &quot;It came to a boil.&quot;

During these events, no gunshots were fired. The people did not react strongly, which according to the military, was a sign of approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. The plotters were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.

Second Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave instructions to transfer M&#x27;ba to Ndjolé, Aubame&#x27;s electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed president and his captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to Lambaréné. Several hours later, they returned to Libreville. The new head of government quickly contacted French ambassador Paul Cousseran, to assure him that the property of foreign nationals was protected and to ask him to prevent any French military intervention.

But in Paris, de Gaulle decided otherwise. M&#x27;ba was one of the most loyal allies to France in Africa. While visiting France in 1961, M&#x27;ba said: &quot;All Gabonese have two fatherlands: France and Gabon.&quot; Moreover, under his regime, Europeans enjoyed particularly friendly treatment. The French authorities therefore decided, in accordance with signed Franco-Gabon agreements, to restore the legitimate government. Intervention could not commence without a formal request to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M&#x27;ba was otherwise occupied, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. However, he remained unaccounted for; therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. Less than 24 hours later, French troops stationed in Dakar and Brazzaville landed in Libreville and restored M&#x27;ba back into power. Over the course of the operation, one French soldier was killed, while 15 to 25 died on the Gabonese side.

===Under the tutelage of France===
After he was reinstated into power, M&#x27;ba refused to consider the coup was directed against him and his regime. He believed it was a conspiracy against the state. Soon, however, anti-government demonstrations sprang up, with slogans such as &quot;Léon M&#x27;ba, président des Français!&quot; () or ones that called for the end of the &quot;dictatorship&quot;. They showed solidarity after Aubame was charged on 23 March for his alleged involvement in the coup d&#x27;état. Despite the fact that he did not participate in the planning of the coup, Aubame was sentenced at his trial to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile.

Despite these events, legislative elections, which were planned before the coup, were held in April 1964. The major opposition parties were deprived of their leaders, who were prevented from participating in the elections due to their involvement in the coup. The UDSG disappeared from the political scene, and the opposition consisted of parties that lacked national focus and maintained only regional or pro-democracy platforms. The opposition still won 46% of the votes and 16 of 47 seats, while the BDG received 54% of the vote and 31 seats in the assembly.

His French friends constantly surrounded him, protecting or providing him with counsel. A presidential guard was created by Bob Maloubier, a former French secret agent, and co-financed by French oil groups. The oil groups, active in the country since 1957, had strengthened their interests in 1962 after the discovery of offshore oil deposits. Gabon quickly became a major oil supplier for France. They carried such influence in Gabon that following the February 1964 coup, the decision to seek military intervention was taken by the CEO of Union Générale des Pétroles (UGP; now known as Elf Aquitaine), Pierre Guillaumat, Foccart, and other French businessmen and leaders. Later on, another UGP executive, Guy Ponsaillé, was appointed as political adviser to the president and became M&#x27;ba&#x27;s representative in discussions with French companies. However, the Gabonese president was afraid of internal strife or assassination, so he remained secluded inside his heavily defended presidential palace. Ponsaillé helped M&#x27;ba obtain support from political moderates and accompanied him in his visits around the country in order to restore his reputation among the Gabonese people.

French ambassador Cousseran and American ambassador Charles F. Darlington, suspected of sympathizing with Aubame, left shortly after the coup. The new French ambassador François Simon de Quirielle, a &quot;traditional diplomat&quot;, was determined not to interfere in the internal affairs of Gabon. After a few months of misunderstandings with de Quirielle, M&#x27;ba contacted Foccart to tell him that he could no longer work with the Ambassador. Foccart recounted the events in his memoirs, &quot;Foccart Speaks&quot;:

As a result of this incident, Foccart appointed a &quot;colonialist&quot;, Maurice Delauney, as the new French Ambassador to Gabon.

===Succession and legacy===
From 1965, the French began looking for a successor for M&#x27;ba, who was aging and sick. They found the perfect candidate in Albert Bernard Bongo (later known as Alhaji Omar Bongo Ondimba), a young leader in the President&#x27;s cabinet. Bongo was personally &quot;tested&quot; by General de Gaulle in 1965, during a visit to the Élysée Palace. Confirmed as M&#x27;ba&#x27;s successor, Bongo was appointed on 24 September 1965 as Presidential Representative and placed in charge of defence and coordination.

In August 1966, M&#x27;ba was admitted to the Hôpital Charles Bernard, a hospital in Paris. Despite his inability to govern, the president clung to his power. Only after a long insistence by Foccart did M&#x27;ba agree to appoint Bongo as Vice President in replacement of Yembit, announcing his decision through a radio and television message recorded in his room on 14 November 1966. A constitutional reform in February 1967 legitimized Bongo as M&#x27;ba&#x27;s successor. The preparations for the succession were finalized by the early legislative and presidential elections held on 19 March 1967. Since no one dared to stand on the opposition ticket, M&#x27;ba was reelected with 99.9% of the vote, while the BDG won all seats in the Assembly.

On 28 November 1967, just days after he took his presidential oath at the Gabonese embassy, M&#x27;ba died of cancer in Paris, where he had been treated since August of that year. He was survived by his wife, Pauline M&#x27;ba, and 11 children. The day after M&#x27;ba&#x27;s death, Bongo constitutionally succeeded him as President of Gabon. Gabon&#x27;s main airport, the Leon M&#x27;ba International Airport, was later named for him.

Forty years after his death, the Léon M&#x27;ba Memorial was built in Libreville to honor his memory. President Bongo laid the cornerstone for the Memorial on 9 February 2007, and it was inaugurated by Bongo on 27 November 2007. In February 2008, it was opened to the public. In addition to serving as a mausoleum for M&#x27;ba, the Memorial is a cultural center.

<text>Pay It Forward is a 2000 American romantic drama film directed by Mimi Leder. The film is based loosely on the novel of the same name by Catherine Ryan Hyde. It is set in Las Vegas, and it chronicles 11- to 12-year-old Trevor McKinney&#x27;s launch of a goodwill movement known as &quot;pay it forward&quot;. It stars Haley Joel Osment as Trevor, Helen Hunt as his alcoholic single mother Arlene McKinney, and Kevin Spacey as his physically and emotionally scarred social studies teacher Eugene Simonet. The film was released on October 20, 2000, to mixed reviews and was a box office disappointment, grossing $55.7 million worldwide against a $40 million budget.

==Plot==
Trevor McKinney begins the seventh grade in Las Vegas. His social studies teacher, Eugene Simonet, assigns the class to put into action a plan that will change the world for the better. Trevor calls his plan &quot;pay it forward&quot;, which means the recipient of a favor does a favor for three others rather than paying it back. However, it needs to be a favor the recipient cannot complete themselves. Trevor implements the plan himself, forming a branch of good deeds. His first deed is to let a homeless man named Jerry live in his garage, and Jerry pays the favor forward by doing car repairs for Trevor&#x27;s mother, Arlene, though Jerry later disappoints Trevor by moving out and returning to drug use.

Meanwhile, Arlene confronts Eugene about Trevor&#x27;s project after discovering Jerry in their house. Trevor then selects Eugene as his next &quot;pay it forward&quot; target and tricks Eugene and Arlene into a romantic dinner date. This also appears to fail, and Trevor and Arlene argue about her love for Ricky, her alcoholic ex-husband, to the point where Arlene slaps Trevor in a fit of anger. Eugene and Arlene are brought together again when Trevor runs away from home, and Arlene asks Eugene to help her find him. After finding Trevor, Arlene begins to pursue Eugene sexually. Eugene has deep burn marks visible on his neck and face, and he initially resists Arlene&#x27;s overtures out of insecurity. When they finally sleep together, he is seen to have extensive scarring all over his torso. Arlene accepts this and forms an emotional bond with him, but abandons their relationship when Ricky returns, claiming to have quit drinking. Her accepting him angers Eugene, whose mother had a habit of taking his abusive, alcoholic father back. Eugene explains that his scars are the result of his father setting him on fire in a drunken rage. He berates Arlene for being like his mother and warns her of Ricky&#x27;s potential to abuse Trevor. When Ricky starts drinking again and resumes his abusive behavior, Arlene realizes her mistake and forces Ricky to leave. In his final scene, Jerry talks a suicide jumper off a bridge.

Trevor&#x27;s school assignment marks the beginning of the story&#x27;s chronology, but the opening scene in the film shows one of the later favors in the &quot;pay it forward&quot; tree, in which a man gives a car to Los Angeles journalist Chris Chandler. As the film proceeds, Chris traces the chain of favors back to its origin as Trevor&#x27;s school project. After her date with Eugene, Arlene pays Jerry&#x27;s favor forward by forgiving her own mother, Grace, for her mistakes in raising Arlene, and Grace, who is homeless, helps a gang member escape from the police. The gang member then saves an asthmatic girl&#x27;s life in a hospital, and the girl&#x27;s father gives Chris his new car.

Chris finally identifies Trevor as the originator of &quot;pay it forward&quot; and conducts a recorded interview in which Trevor describes his hopes and concerns for the project. Eugene, hearing Trevor, realizes that he and Arlene should be together. As Eugene and Arlene reconcile with an embrace, Trevor notices his friend Adam being bullied. He pays forward to Adam by rushing into the scene and fighting the bullies while Eugene and Arlene rush to stop him. One of the bullies pulls out a switchblade as another one pushes Trevor against him, fatally stabbing Trevor in the stomach. Trevor later dies at the hospital at 7:35 pm. This, and the spread of the movement across the country, is being reported in the news; Arlene and Eugene are soon visited by thousands of people, including students from Trevor&#x27;s school, who have participated in or heard of the &quot;pay it forward&quot; movement by gathering in a vigil to honor him.

==Cast==
* Kevin Spacey as Eugene Simonet, Trevor&#x27;s social studies teacher, and an emotionally and physically scarred man. As a teenager, he suffered abuse from his father (including lighting him on fire) and still has burns visible on his face and torso. He begins the film as a shy recluse, self-conscious about his deformities, but eventually, he enters a relationship with Trevor&#x27;s mother Arlene, and overcomes his fears. He sets an assignment for Trevor&#x27;s class, asking them to change the world for the better. He is changed significantly from the novel, where there was an African-American man named Reuben St. Clair who had been injured in the Vietnam War. 
* Helen Hunt as Arlene McKinney, Trevor&#x27;s alcoholic, single mother who works at both a casino and a strip club. She has a past history of abusive relationships, especially with her mostly absent husband Ricky. She eventually enters a relationship with Eugene, and with his and Trevor&#x27;s help manages to overcome her alcoholism and abuse. 
* Haley Joel Osment as Trevor McKinney, an 11 to 12-year-old boy who is troubled by his mother&#x27;s alcoholism and his father&#x27;s abuse and absence. He starts the &quot;pay it forward&quot; movement. He initially believes that the movement was not successful, and does not feel much pride toward it, stating that he was acting to improve the world, not to receive recognition. He is stabbed and killed while trying to pay it forward to his bullied friend Adam. 
* Jay Mohr as Chris Chandler, a reporter who traces the &quot;pay it forward&quot; movement from Los Angeles back to Trevor. He interviews Trevor and writes a magazine column about the movement after Trevor&#x27;s death. 
* James Caviezel as Jerry, a homeless drug addict whom Trevor attempts to help as part of the &quot;pay it forward&quot; movement. Although Trevor believes his attempts have failed once Jerry relapses into drug use, Jerry eventually pays it forward by saving a woman who is about to kill herself by jumping off a bridge. 
* Angie Dickinson as Grace, Arlene&#x27;s mother and Trevor&#x27;s maternal grandmother. Although she was a negligent parent to Arlene, almost forcing them to live on the street, Arlene eventually forgives her as part of the &quot;pay it forward&quot; movement.
* Jon Bon Jovi as Ricky McKinney, Trevor&#x27;s abusive and alcoholic father who has left the family. Arlene often allows him to return to the family despite the abuse; however, she learns throughout the film to reject him and protect Trevor and herself from violence.
* Marc Donato as Adam, Trevor&#x27;s friend who has been bullied his whole life at school. Trevor pays it forward to him by preventing him from being bullied; however, Trevor is fatally stabbed in the process.
* David Ramsey also stars as Sidney Parker, also involved in the &quot;pay it forward&quot; movement, as does Gary Werntz (director Mimi Leder&#x27;s real-life husband) as Mr. Thorsen. Kathleen Wilhoite also stars as Bonnie, Arlene&#x27;s sponsor and mentor.

==Production==
Leslie Dixon adapted the screenplay from the book of the same name by Catherine Ryan Hyde, which was available as an open writing assignment. Dixon struggled with the adaptation of the book in part because of multiple narrative voices within it. Specifically, the reporter, the central character in the film, does not show up until halfway through the novel. Stuck, Dixon considered returning the money she was paid for the assignment. She eventually hit upon the idea to start with the reporter and trace the events backward. Dixon presented the idea to Hyde who in turn liked it so much that she decided to change the then-unpublished novel&#x27;s plot structure to mirror the film&#x27;s. In the novel, the character of Eugene Simonet was originally an African-American man named Reuben St. Clair. The role was offered to Denzel Washington, but he turned it down to do &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; instead. Kevin Spacey was contacted next and accepted the role of Eugene Simonet.

In November 1999, it was announced that Osment had been cast as Trevor McKinney.

Though the book is set in Tucson, Arizona, the film production changed the setting to Las Vegas, Nevada, to &quot;show Las Vegas life off the Strip.&quot; Filming took place between February and April 2000 in Las Vegas and in studio in Los Angeles, California, with additional shooting (for the bridge scene) taking place in Portland, Oregon.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Thomas Newman and was released by Varèse Sarabande on October 31, 2000. The soundtrack generally was praised by critics, and is considered to be fitting with the theme of the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at #4 at the North American box office making $9,631,359 million USD in its opening weekend, behind &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;, &quot;Bedazzled&quot; and &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, the latter of which was on its third week of release at the number one spot.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval score of 39% based on 131 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Pay It Forward&quot; has strong performances from Spacey, Hunt, and Osment, but the movie itself is too emotionally manipulative and the ending is bad.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100 based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two and a half out of four stars, stating &quot;With a cleaner story line, the basic idea could have been free to deliver. As it is, we get a better movie than we might have, because the performances are so good: Spacey as a vulnerable and wounded man, Hunt as a woman no less wounded in her own way, and Osment, once again proving himself the equal of adult actors in the complexity and depth of his performance. I believed in them and cared for them. I wish the movie could have gotten out of their way.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Lisa Schwarzbaum gave it a &quot;D&quot; grade, calling it &quot;reprehensible&quot; for using &quot;shameless cliches of emotional and physical damage&quot; and then &quot;blackmailing audiences into joining the let&#x27;s-be-nice &#x27;movement&#x27;&quot; in order to be transparent Oscar bait.

<text>Lewis Robert &quot;Hack&quot; Wilson (April 26, 1900 – November 23, 1948) was an American Major League Baseball player who played 12 seasons for the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. Despite his diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s. His 1930 season with the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season hitting performances in baseball history. Highlights included 56 home runs, the National League record for 68 years; and 191 runs batted in, a mark yet to be surpassed. &quot;For a brief span of a few years,&quot; wrote a sportswriter of the day, &quot;this hammered down little strongman actually rivaled the mighty Ruth.&quot;

While Wilson&#x27;s combativeness and excessive alcohol consumption made him one of the most colorful sports personalities of his era, his drinking and fighting undoubtedly contributed to a premature end to his athletic career and, ultimately, his premature death. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.

==Baseball career==

===Early life and minor leagues===
Lewis Robert Wilson was born April 26, 1900, in the Pennsylvania steel mill town of Ellwood City, north of Pittsburgh. His mother, Jennie Kaughn, 16, was an unemployed drifter from Philadelphia; his father, Robert Wilson, 24, was a steel worker. His parents never married; both were heavy drinkers, and in 1907 his mother died of appendicitis at the age of 24.

In 1916, Wilson left school to take a job at a locomotive factory, swinging a sledge hammer for four dollars a week. Although only tall, he weighed with an 18-inch neck, and feet that fit into size shoes. Sportswriter Shirley Povich later observed that he was &quot;built along the lines of a beer keg, and was not wholly unfamiliar with its contents.&quot; While his unusual physique was considered an oddity at the time, his large head, tiny feet, short legs, and broad, flat face are now recognized as hallmarks of fetal alcohol syndrome.

In 1921, Wilson moved to Martinsburg, West Virginia, to join the Martinsburg Mountaineers of the Class &quot;D&quot; Blue Ridge League. After breaking his leg while sliding into home plate during his first professional game, he was moved from the catcher&#x27;s position to the outfield. In 1922, he met Virginia Riddleburger, a 34-year-old office clerk; they married the following year. In 1923, playing for the &quot;B&quot; division Portsmouth Truckers, he led the Virginia League in hitting with a .388 batting average. Late in the season, New York Giants manager John McGraw purchased his contract from Portsmouth for $10,500 ($ in current dollar terms).

===New York Giants===
Wilson made his major league debut with the Giants on September 29, 1923, at the age of 23, and became the starting left fielder the following season. By mid-July he was ranked second in the National League (NL) in hitting. He ended the season with a .295 average, 10 home runs, and 57 runs batted in (RBIs) as New York won the NL pennant. In the 1924 World Series he averaged only .233 in a seven-game loss to the Washington Senators.

Multiple stories exist to explain the origin of Wilson&#x27;s nickname. By one account, a New York newspaper held a nicknaming contest; the winning entry was &quot;Hack&quot; because he reminded many fans of another stocky athlete, the popular wrestler Georg Hackenschmidt. In another version, McGraw is said to have remarked that Wilson&#x27;s physique was reminiscent of a &quot;hack&quot; (slang for taxicab in that era). Giants teammate Bill Cunningham claimed that the nickname was based on Wilson&#x27;s resemblance to Hack Miller, an outfielder with the Chicago Cubs. The &quot;New York Times&quot; printed the first documented usage of &quot;Hack&quot; on June 10, 1924.

Early in the 1925 season, Wilson hit the longest home run on record at Ebbets Field against the Brooklyn Robins, but fell into a slump in May, and was replaced in left field by Irish Meusel. On July 2, he hit two home runs in one inning, tying Ken Williams&#x27; major league record set in 1922, but his hitting slump continued. In August, McGraw told reporters that he had &quot;... made the mistake of rushing [Wilson] along,&quot; and sent him to the Giants&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. At season&#x27;s end, a front office oversight — or possibly, deliberate inaction — left him unprotected on the Toledo roster, and the last-place Chicago Cubs acquired him on waivers. &quot;They let go the best outfielder I ever played alongside,&quot; said Giants right fielder Ross Youngs, &quot;and they&#x27;re going to regret it.&quot;

During the 1925 World Series — between the Senators and the Pittsburgh Pirates — Wilson&#x27;s son, Robert, was born.

===Glory years with the Cubs===

Wilson regained his form as the Cubs&#x27; center fielder in 1926, and he quickly became a favorite of Chicago fans. On May 24, he hit the center field scoreboard with one of the longest home runs in Wrigley Field history as the Cubs came from behind to defeat the Boston Braves. Later that evening, he made news again when he was arrested during a police raid of a Prohibition-era speakeasy while trying to escape through the rear window, and was fined one dollar. He ended the season with a league-leading 21 home runs along with 36 doubles, 109 RBIs, a .321 batting average, and a .406 on-base percentage. The Cubs improved to fourth place, and Wilson ended the year ranked fifth in voting for the NL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award.

Another strong performance followed in 1927 as Wilson once again led the league in home runs. Although the Cubs were in first place heading into the final month of the season, the team faltered and again finished fourth. Wilson posted a .318 average with 30 home runs and 129 RBIs, and led NL outfielders with 400 putouts. He led the NL in home runs for a third consecutive year in 1928 with 31, along with 120 RBIs and a .313 average as the Cubs improved to third place.

Wilson had a combative streak and sometimes initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928, a near-riot broke out in the ninth inning at Wrigley Field against the St. Louis Cardinals when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan. An estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate the combatants and restore order. The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, but a jury ruled in Wilson&#x27;s favor. The following year, he took offense at a remark by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ray Kolp, and — upon reaching first base after hitting a single — he charged into the Reds dugout, punching Kolp several times before they could be separated. Later that evening at the train station, Wilson exchanged words and blows with Cincinnati player Pete Donohue. In late 1929, he signed a contract to fight Art Shires of the Chicago White Sox in a boxing match, but reneged after Cubs president William Veeck, Sr. enlisted Wilson&#x27;s wife Virginia to dissuade him, and then Shires lost a fight to George Trafton of the Chicago Bears. There was nothing to gain, Wilson said, by fighting a defeated boxer.

Wilson&#x27;s &quot;penchant for festivities&quot; is also well documented. Biographer Clifton Blue Parker described him as &quot;... the Roaring &#x27;20s epitome of a baseball player, primed for an age of American excess ... at a time when baseball was America&#x27;s favorite sport.&quot; His love of drinking and partying did not endear him to Cubs owner William Wrigley, who abhorred alcohol consumption. (Wilson always insisted that he never played drunk; &quot;hung over, yes; drunk, no.&quot;) Manager Joe McCarthy worked hard to shield Wilson from Wrigley, and to keep him on an even keel. &quot;Better than any other manager,&quot; wrote sportswriter Frank Graham, &quot;Joe understood Hack, made allowances for him when he failed, and rewarded him with praise when he did well. Joe could be strict and stern with his players ... but he never was with Hack, and Hack repaid him by playing as he never had before, nor would again.&quot;

In 1929, Wilson hit .345 with 39 home runs and a league-record 159 RBIs. He and new teammate Rogers Hornsby (who also contributed 39 home runs) led the Cubs to their first NL pennant in eleven years. In the World Series against Connie Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics, Wilson&#x27;s .471 hitting performance was eclipsed by two fielding errors at Shibe Park. Though trailing the Series two games to one, the Cubs were leading by a score of 8–0 in the fourth game when the Athletics mounted a 10-run rally in the seventh inning. Wilson lost two fly balls in the sun; the second, with two runners on base, led to an inside-the-park home run by Mule Haas as the Athletics won 10–8. After the game, McCarthy reportedly told a boy asking for a souvenir baseball, &quot;Come back tomorrow and stand behind Wilson, and you&#x27;ll be able to pick up all the balls you want!&quot; The Athletics won again the next day to take the Series in five games.

====1930 peak====
Wilson&#x27;s 1930 season, aided by a lively ball wound with special Australian wool, is considered one of the best single-season hitting performances in baseball history. By the middle of July, he had accumulated 82 RBIs. In August, he hit 13 home runs and 53 RBIs, and by September 17 he had reached 174 RBIs, breaking Lou Gehrig&#x27;s major league record established three years earlier. He finished the season with 190 RBIs, along with a then-NL-record 56 home runs, .356 batting average, .454 on-base percentage, and league-leading .723 slugging percentage. He was unofficially voted the NL&#x27;s most &quot;useful&quot; player by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (which did not inaugurate its official MVP award until 1931).

In 1999, the Commissioner of Baseball officially increased Wilson&#x27;s 1930 RBI total to 191 after a box score analysis by baseball historian Jerome Holtzman revealed that Charlie Grimm had been mistakenly credited with an RBI actually driven home by Wilson during the second game of a doubleheader on July 28. Wilson&#x27;s 191 RBIs remains one of baseball&#x27;s most enduring records; only Gehrig (185) and Hank Greenberg (184) ever came close, and there have been no serious challenges in the last 85 years. (The best effort since 1938 was 165 by Manny Ramirez in 1999.)

Reds catcher Clyde Sukeforth asserted that Wilson should have been credited with an additional home run in 1930 as well. &quot;He hit one in Cincinnati one day,&quot; he said, &quot;way up in the seats, hit it so hard that it bounced right back onto the field. The umpire had a bad angle on it and ruled that it had hit the screen and bounced back. I was sitting in the Cincinnati bullpen, and of course, we weren&#x27;t going to say anything. But Hack really hit 57 that year.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s official total of 56 stood as the NL record until the 1998 season, when it was broken by Sammy Sosa (66) and Mark McGwire (70).

===Decline===
Wilson&#x27;s success in the 1930 season served only to fuel his drinking habits, and in 1931 he reported to spring training 20 pounds overweight. In addition, the NL responded to the prodigious offensive statistics of the previous year (the only season, other than 1894, in which the league as a whole batted over .300) by introducing a heavier ball with raised stitching to allow pitchers to gain a better grip and throw sharper curveballs. Wilson complained that the new Cubs manager, Hornsby, did not allow him to &quot;swing away&quot; as much as Joe McCarthy had. He hit his 200th career home run at Ebbets Field on June 18 — only the fourth player ever to do so, behind Ruth, Cy Williams, and Hornsby — but then fell into a protracted slump, and was benched in late May. By late August, Wrigley publicly expressed his desire to trade him. On September 6, he was suspended without pay for the remainder of the season after a fight with reporters aboard a train in Cincinnati. He was hitting .261 with only 13 home runs (his 1930 production during August alone) at the time.

In December 1931, the Cubs traded Wilson, along with Bud Teachout, to the St. Louis Cardinals for Burleigh Grimes. Less than a month later, the Cardinals sent him to the Brooklyn Dodgers for minor league outfielder Bob Parham and $25,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Wilson hit .297 with 23 home runs and 123 RBIs for Brooklyn in 1932. He began 1933 with a ninth-inning game-winning pinch-hit inside-the-park grand slam home run at Ebbets Field—the first pinch-hit grand slam in Dodger history, and only the third inside-the-park pinch-hit grand slam in MLB history. By season&#x27;s end, his offensive totals had dropped substantially, and he was hitting .262 when the Dodgers released him mid-season in 1934. The Philadelphia Phillies signed him immediately, but after just two hits in 20 at-bats he was released again a month later. After a final season with the Albany Senators of the Class &quot;A&quot; New York–Pennsylvania League, Wilson retired at the age of 35.

In a 12-year major league career, Wilson played in 1,348 games and accumulated 1,461 hits in 4,760 at-bats for a .307 career batting average and a .395 on-base percentage. He hit 244 home runs and batted in 1,063 runs, led the NL in home runs four times, and surpassed 100 RBIs six times. Defensively, he finished his career with a .965 fielding percentage. For players or shorter, he has the most home runs for any player in major league history.

==Life after baseball==

Wilson returned to Martinsburg where he opened a pool hall, but encountered financial problems due to a failed sporting goods business venture, and then a rancorous divorce from Virginia. By 1938, he was working as a bartender near Brooklyn&#x27;s Ebbets Field where he sang for drinks, but had to quit when customers became too abusive. A night club venture in suburban Chicago was another financial failure. In 1944, he took a job as a good will ambassador for a professional basketball team in Washington, D.C., where he lamented that fans remembered his two dropped fly balls in the 1929 World Series far more vividly than his 56 home runs and 191 RBIs in 1930. Unable to find work in professional baseball, he moved to Baltimore where he worked as a tool checker in an airplane manufacturing plant and later as a laborer for the City of Baltimore. When municipal authorities realized who he was, he was made the manager of a Baltimore public swimming pool.

On October 4, 1948, Wilson was discovered unconscious after a fall in his home. Though the accident did not appear serious at first, pneumonia and other complications developed and he died of internal hemorrhaging on November 23, 1948, at the age of 48.

Wilson — once the highest-paid player in the National League — died penniless; his son, Robert, refused to claim his remains. NL President Ford Frick finally sent money to cover his funeral expenses. His gray burial suit was donated by the undertaker. In marked contrast to Babe Ruth&#x27;s funeral, which had been attended by thousands just three months earlier, only a few hundred people were present for Wilson&#x27;s services. He was buried in Rosedale Cemetery in the town where he made his professional playing debut, Martinsburg, West Virginia.

Ten months later, Joe McCarthy organized a second, more complete memorial service, attended by Kiki Cuyler, Charlie Grimm, Nick Altrock and other players from the Cubs and the Martinsburg team (by then renamed the Blue Sox). A granite tombstone was unveiled, with the inscription, &quot;One of Baseball&#x27;s Immortals, Lewis R. (Hack) Wilson, Rests Here.&quot;

One week before his death, Wilson gave an interview to CBS Radio which was reprinted in Chicago newspapers. In 1949, Charlie Grimm, the Cubs&#x27; new manager, posted a framed excerpt from that interview in the Cubs&#x27; clubhouse, where it remains. It reads, in part:

Talent isn&#x27;t enough. You need common sense and good advice. If anyone tries to tell you different, tell them the story of Hack Wilson. [...] There are kids in and out of baseball who think because they have talent they have the world by the tail. It isn&#x27;t so. Kids, don&#x27;t be too big to accept advice. Don&#x27;t let what happened to me happen to you.

In 1979, Wilson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. A Martinsburg street is named Hack Wilson Way in his honor, and the access road to a large city park within his hometown, Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, is known as Hack Wilson Drive.

<text>The Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão (; SBT ; &quot;Brazilian Television System&quot;) is a Brazilian free-to-air television network founded on Wednesday, 19 August 1981, by the businessman and television personality Silvio Santos. The company was established after a public tender by the Brazilian Federal Government to form two new networks, created from revoked concessions of the defunct Tupi and Excelsior networks. The SBT was founded on the same day that the concession agreement was signed, and that the act was broadcast live by the network, so that this was his first program aired. Before acquiring the concessions of the four stations that were to form the SBT, Grupo Silvio Santos had since 1976 the concession of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s channel 11, known as TVS Rio de Janeiro (now SBT Rio), which was a fundamental step to give life to the SBT.

In April 2018, the SBT was the second-most watched television network in Brazil, behind Globo. Throughout its existence, the network always occupied the space in the audience ranking, except between 2007 and 2014, when the Record network took its place. The SBT has a total of 114 broadcast television stations (O&amp;Os and affiliates) throughout the Brazilian territory, and is also available through pay television operators (cable and satellite), free-to-air signal on satellite receivers and also through streaming media in their mobile application (Android, iOS and Windows), applications for smart TVs and its website. Also on their website, its programming is available in video on demand for free, also available from the video-sharing site YouTube since 2010. In March 2017, the 43 channels of the SBT on YouTube accumulated 20 million subscribers and 70 billion minutes watched.

The SBT broadcasts their programming a wide variety of television genres, whereas its own material generally stand adjacent to the entertainment. Foreign programming, mainly the telenovelas produced by the networks owned by the Mexican conglomerate Televisa, are part of their program schedule. It is the only commercial television broadcaster in Brazil which airs children&#x27;s programming, even arranging a partnership with The Walt Disney Company, in which the company provides two hours of daily programming for the network. The network also possess times for the television news, producing in all three daily newscasts, a weekly news program and a weekly newscast.

The network owns the CDT da Anhanguera, a television complex located at the kilometer 18 of the Rodovia Anhanguera, in Osasco, São Paulo, occupying an area of 231 thousand square meters. This is the third largest television complex in size installed in Latin America, being smaller only than the studios of TV Azteca, in Mexico, and the Estúdios Globo.

==History==
===Before the SBT===
Rede Tupi, the channel 4 in São Paulo, began operations in 1950. In 1962 (when he began his first TV program), Silvio Santos produced his own programs on Tupi, TV Paulista and on Rede Globo beginning in 1965. Soon enough, he started plans to have his own television channel. His production company, Estudios Silvio Santos Cinema e Televisao, was successful on Tupi, Globo and (since 1972) on Record (where he then owned half of the company&#x27;s stock).

In 1976, with help from humorist and friend Manuel de Nóbrega (who had a show on Rede Globo and was part of &quot;Baú da Felicidade&quot;), Santos obtained a license for his own station: Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s channel 11, known as &quot;TV Studios&quot; or &quot;TVS&quot;. Soon after its launch, its flagship program (&quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; on Sundays) plus the late night &quot;Silvio Santos Diferente&quot; on weekdays began to be broadcast (Santos left Globo the same year). Other programs soon began, as the network gained support from city residents who sought an alternative to Globo, Tupi, Bandeirantes and TV Rio (the city&#x27;s network, related to TV Record along with TVS). The new channel debuted on 14 May 1976, with a logo of a gold circle with the number 11 slanted in gold, which featured in the first Scanimate idents and promos for the channel - making it a pioneer station in the country when it came to computer animation. While during its early years the network studios were based in Rio, all program production for TVS transferred to São Paulo in 1978–79.

When Rede Tupi went out of business in 1980, Santos obtained three stations from the network: the São Paulo&#x27;s channel 4, the Porto Alegre&#x27;s channel 5 and the Belém&#x27;s channel 5. The SBT was created, launching on 19 August 1981, but using the TVS name until 1990 for some of its stations. Until the formation of the SBT, the Silvio Santos Group also had a station named TVS in Nova Friburgo, serving viewers in the northern and western parts of the state, this was also its first branch station, having opened in 1979.

In 1978, Minas Gerais&#x27; TV Alterosa became one of the SBT&#x27;s broadcast-affiliate networks, the first affiliate station for the channel. Some later affiliates were adopted from Rede Tupi after its closure on 18 July 1980, by order of Brazilian Minister of Communications Haroldo de Matos, who the following year would order SBT to begin transmissions. When Tupi closed, &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; moved to Record but continued simulcasting Sundays on the TVS Channels 11 and 3, as well as on yet another SS Group station - Channel 9, purchased from TV Continental. Santos began the network&#x27;s expansion efforts, convincing stations to become the SBT and Record affiliates. The official launch of the network on 19 August 1981, also marked the debut of its first presentation package using its famous circle logo (similar to the one used till today by the American Broadcasting Company) and dual branding (the SBT being the official name of the network while TVS being the station branding in its three founding stations), and it was the only network launch to be held in Brasília and broadcast directly from the federal capital city. The first idents were similar to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Still the One&quot; idents of 1979, used by the Nine Network in Australia in 1980.

The Matos decision also gave the network the Sumare studios of Tupi for drama production. By the time of the 1981 launch the SBT had 18 affiliate channels nationwide.

===1980s===
During the 1980s, the SBT established itself, contracting popular hosts and airing a mix of its own and Televisa programming (especially Mexican &quot;telenovelas&quot; and comedy shows such as &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;). It climbed to second place in the Brazilian ratings (except in Rio de Janeiro, where Rede Manchete occupied that position). Moreover, it hosted the Brazilian version of &quot;Bozo&quot; for kids plus even let ex-Tupi program presenters bring their shows over to the fledgling network.

The SBT, together with Record (under the SBT/Record pool) broadcast the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, two years before its 1986 FIFA World Cup coverage.

1985 would see the SBT score a historic victory with the broadcast of the Australian miniseries &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, and TVS Channel 4 São Paulo became SBT Channel 4 São Paulo, thus becoming a truly national network with the introduction of satellite broadcasts.

In March 1986, the network premiered its new talk show, &quot;Hebe&quot;, with Hebe Camargo as host; the show was formerly on Rede Tupi and Rede Bandeirantes. It became one of the network&#x27;s longest-running programs, running for over 24 years; the final show was at the end of 2010, when Camargo ended her contract. She had a spin-off show, &quot;Hebe por Elas&quot; (&quot;Hebe for All&quot;), during the early 1990s. The death of Flavio Cavacante, one of the network&#x27;s pioneer presenters, just days after his 22 May episode of his own program shocked the nation so much that on the day of his funeral the network started transmissions only in the afternoon in his honor.

In 1987, Santos pursued a better-quality program lineup, while trying to attract a larger audience and better advertisers. During that year (in response to the high popularity of Rede Globo&#x27;s &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot; on weekdays), SBT began increasing its child-oriented programming with programs such as &quot;Oradukapeta&quot;, &quot;Show Maravilha&quot; and the &quot;Do Re Mi&quot; series. Nearly all SBT kids&#x27; programs had female presenters (different from the format of &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot;), because &quot;Oradukapeta&quot; was hosted by Sergio Mallandro (also a &quot;Show de Calorous&quot; judge).

After acquiring the miniseries &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, SBT would schedule it after Globo&#x27;s highly-rated soap opera &quot;Roque Santeiro&quot;, with Santos promoting that viewers could watch the soap and the &quot;sensational&quot; miniseries immediately afterward. SBT went as far as to pre-empt &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; with cartoons after Globo—which had long been known for the punctuality of its schedule—responded by making &quot;Santeiro&quot; intentionally overrun its timeslot (thus keeping Santos&#x27; word that &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; would air after &quot;Santeiro&quot;). SBT would also delaying an airing of the &quot;Rambo&quot; film &quot;First Blood&quot; with 50 minutes of dead air, after Globo scheduled a double-chapter of &quot;Vale Tudo&quot; against it. SBT had already pre-empted its showing of the film by a week after Globo scheduled an airing of &quot;&quot; the same day to compete. 1987 also was the year that the network began to change its corporate branding from TVS to the SBT.

Humorist Jô Soares was brought in from TV Globo in 1988, introducing a late-night talk program to Brazilian TV with his 11:30 PM show entitled &quot;Jô Soares Onze e Meia&quot;. Also signed was Boris Casoy, who became the first news anchor in Brazil with his &quot;TJ Brasil&quot; newscast (which succeeded &quot;Noticentro&quot;, the network&#x27;s first newscast with Antonio Casale) and ex-Balão Mágico member Simony.

In 1988, Santos prevented host &quot;Gugu&quot; Liberato from signing with Globo after Liberato hosted the SBT&#x27;s big weekend hit &quot;Viva a Noite&quot; since 1986. This was widely seen as indicative that Gugu would be Santos&#x27; successor on Sunday afternoons, reinforced by the extended timeslot of Gugu&#x27;s future program &quot;Domingo Legal&quot;. As a result, &quot;Programa Sílvio Santos&quot; adopted the dual-presenter format, with Gugu hosting segments such as the Brazilian version of Double Dare, called &quot;Passa ou Repassa&quot; (known for its &quot;Torta na Cara&quot; segment) and &quot;Cidade contra Cidade&quot;.

===1990s===
The TVS brand was merged into the SBT brand in 1990; the name change was seen in a new campaign ad modeled on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Come Home to NBC&quot; campaign of 1986–87, which premiered early that year, and in August on TV station identifications celebrating SBT&#x27;s ninth year of broadcasts (that year, Silvio Santos sold Record as a national network) and it also broadcast the 1990 FIFA World Cup. 1991 saw the beginning of its newscast &quot;Aqui Agora&quot; and Serginho Groisman&#x27;s &quot;Programa Livre&quot; variety show, just a few of the many successes for the year even as the network&#x27;s São Paulo studios suffered damages due to massive floods that hit the city. In 1992, the SBT and Rede Globo (together with Manchete, Band, and SporTV) jointly broadcast the 1992 Summer Olympics and the 1996 Summer Olympics (together with Manchete, Record, Band, SporTV, and ESPN) nationwide, with a grand advertising campaign for the Brazil national team. Despite problems and even the transfer of talents to other stations (such as the then resurgent Rede Record), the 90s proved to be a boom for the network, beginning its second decade with 74 affiliates, bigger when it signed on.

The SBT invested in its own &quot;telenovelas&quot; and remakes of successful ones from foreign networks (most notably Chiquititas), variety programs, news and current affairs, and broadcast rights for sporting events (including the Copa Mercosur, Copa do Brasil and CART). It signed host Carlos &quot;Ratinho&quot; Massa in 1998, obtained more Mexican productions and launched game shows (such as &quot;Show do Milhão&quot;) in 1999. By the end of the decade the SBT held second place in the Brazilian ratings, after Globo, strengthed by a brand new and technologically advanced television complex, the CDT da Anhanguera, inaugurated in 1996, just in time for its 15th anniversary.

====Ad campaigns====

;American and Australian imports
The 1990s were the SBT&#x27;s most fruitful decade for American-style ad campaigns:
* 1987–1990: NBC&#x27;s second installment of &quot;Come Home to NBC&quot;, with &quot;Vem Que é Bom&quot; with the graphics of 1988&#x27;s &quot;Come Home to the Best, Only on NBC&quot;
* 1986–1991: NBC&#x27;s first year of &quot;Come Home&quot;, with &quot;10 anos com você&quot; (the 10th-anniversary slogan)
* 1990–1991 and 1993–94: CBS&#x27;s second year of &quot;Get Ready for CBS&quot; with &quot;Se liga no SBT&quot;. On 20 January 1991, the Australian Network Ten launched &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; to coincide with a logo change, using in-house music and similar graphics
* 1989–1992 and 1995: ABC&#x27;s first year of &quot;America&#x27;s Watching ABC&quot; became &quot;Fique ligado no SBT&quot;. In 1992 Ten launched &quot;This Is It&quot; with its promo based on the music from &quot;America&#x27;s Watching&quot;, in a different key with different instrumentation and vocals.

;Domestic campaigns
* In 1992, the one-minute spot &quot;Aqui Tem&quot; was launched for network-wide use. The promo featured an in-house soundtrack (with similarities to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Come Home to the Best, Only on NBC&quot; campaign of 1988–89) and graphic elements from NBC&#x27;s 1991 campaign, &quot;The Place to Be&quot;.
* In August 1996 the SBT launched a new logo (replacing its multicoloured stripes with solid colours) and relaunched &quot;QPAA&quot; with a new slogan, &quot;Tudo Pra Você&quot;, for its 15th anniversary.
* In 1997, the SBT made its new graphics based on ABC&#x27;s 1996 campaign, Watched by More People.
* In 1998, the network released &quot;A cara do Brasil&quot;, with new graphics and soundtrack.
* In 1999 the network produced &quot;Na nossa frente, so você&quot;, with new graphics and music. The 64-second promo was used on-air for the first time in 2000; the slogan was used until 2004 with two songs composed for this. The 1st campaign spot (1999-2000) mirrored the Nine Network&#x27;s 1997 promo spots but with an original soundtrack.

===2000s===
The SBT began the decade investing in movies, broadcasting a package of Disney (now affiliated with TV Globo) and Time Warner productions (the latter promoted in a one-hour network block). In 2001, the controversial reality show &quot;Casa dos Artistas&quot;, accused by many of being a copy of Endemol&#x27;s &quot;Big Brother&quot;, marked the first time SBT led the Sunday-night ratings, aside from its &quot;Domingo Legal&quot; program becoming number one in the Sunday afternoon ratings.

Since 2003, with the ratings advances of Record and Rede Bandeirantes, the SBT&#x27;s ratings have declined. Two events that year marked the beginning of its problems:
* Early in the year Silvio Santos gave an interview with the TV-gossip magazine &quot;Contigo!&quot;, in which he stated that he was ill and had sold the SBT. Later, he claimed that this was intended as a joke.
* The &quot;Gugu-PCC scandal&quot;: On September 7 &quot;Domingo Legal&quot; aired an interview with alleged members of the criminal group PCC, threatening the deputy mayor of São Paulo and the hosts of police reality programs on the competing TV Record and RedeTV! networks. Later, it was discovered that this was a hoax; the program was judicially suspended temporarily - and therefore off-the-air for one Sunday, its audience never recovered and Gugu Liberato (its host, once seen as Santos&#x27; successor) never regained his credibility.

Since then the SBT has aired the successful &quot;Rebelde&quot; and shows with child host Maisa Silva, who became popular; however, programs could change without previous announcement (even hosts were sometimes out of the loop), confusing the audience. In 2006 SBT celebrated its 25th anniversary in a deepening crisis.

The SBT is the second-largest network in the country, vying for leadership with Rede Record. The CDT da Anhanguera is the second-largest television-production center in Brazil, behind Projac (owned by Rede Globo). Over 5,000 employees work around the clock at the SBT&#x27;s 110 TV stations.
In 2008 the network lost second place in the ratings to Record, but tied for second place the following year.
In 2009 Liberato moved to Record after more than 20 years with the SBT; at the same time, the SBT signed presenters Roberto Justus and Eliana from Record. It also appeared on SKY Brasil, the last of the five major Brazilian networks to do so.

Recent programs include &quot;What&#x27;s Your Talent&quot;, a local combination of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and &quot;Show de Calouros&quot; (created and hosted by Silvio Santos during the 1970s); a Brazilian version of &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;; an annual telethon, which raised R$19 million in 2009; &quot;Kyle XY&quot;; the reality show &quot;Solitary&quot;; &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;De Frente with Gabi&quot;, a talk show featuring journalist Marilia Gabriela.

TV Alagoas left the network in September 2009 and to broadcast religious programs, and SBT executive director William Stoliar sued to ensure the network&#x27;s availability there. It returned to the SBT on June 1, 2010, due to viewer pressure and late rent payments by religious programs.

In February 2014 the Communist Party of Brazil sends to the Federal Government a questioning, for which he cut around 75 million dollars in advertising the broadcaster, because of criticism that the journalist Rachel Sheherazade makes against the Government.

===2020s===
While the network at large suffered from the effects of the COVID pandemic in the country, it found a renewed calling in sports. One after the other, the network pursued new sporting investments when it snagged the broadcasting rights for the Campeonato Carioca 2020 grand final, followed by a renewed commitment to the Copa Liberatores for the 2020–22 period. In 2021, left and right came contracts after contracts for sports broadcasts with SBT getting the nod as broadcaster to the 2021 Copa America, and a number of arena football and futsal events - a first in network history as SBT marked its 40th anniversary. Buoyed by the sporting successes against the competition the network revived its sports newscasts: &quot;Arena SBT&quot;, which originally premiered in 2014, returned in 2020, followed by the launch the following year of &quot;SBT Sports&quot;.

==Programs==
===History of programming===
The SBT has most of its schedule dedicated to programming for children and pre-teens, and it is a popular network with young audiences. In 1998 it ran the longest children&#x27;s programming block in Brazilian TV history with TV Cultura, from &quot;Sessão Desenho&quot; (a cartoon block) at 7:00 AM (after the morning newscast) until 9:00 PM (when the children&#x27;s telenovela &quot;Chiquititas&quot; ended). The SBT promoted the 14-hour block as &quot;SBT Kids&quot;.

While most TV stations in Brazil depend on domestic productions, the SBT relies on imports (mainly from Mexico and the US). Since 1984, &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; (shown in Brazil as &quot;Chaves&quot;) is one of the station&#x27;s most popular programs. The network had until 2014 an agreement with Warner Brothers, giving it an exclusivity deal for its sitcoms, dramas and films.

Mexican &quot;telenovelas&quot; have been a staple on the SBT, reaching their peak during the early 1990s with the child-oriented &quot;Carrusel&quot;, &quot;La usurpadora&quot;, &quot;El Privilegio de Amar&quot; and &quot;Luz Clarita&quot; and the popular &quot;María trilogy&quot; (&quot;María Mercedes&quot;, &quot;Marimar&quot; and &quot;María la del Barrio&quot;). Compared to subdued Brazilian telenovelas, Mexican soaps are considered tacky and exaggerated.

Other 1990s hits included &quot;Domingo Legal&quot; (&quot;Cool Sunday&quot;) (a Sunday variety show which was the SBT&#x27;s highest-rated program, surpassing &quot;TV Globo&quot;), and the network was the most popular channel in Brazil for hours at a stretch. &quot;Domingo Legal&quot; was criticized for its sensationalism, and its ratings began to fall after the &quot;Primeiro Comando da Capital&quot; (PCC) scandal (see below); the show often ranks second in the ratings. Other popular programs included &quot;Programa do Ratinho&quot; (&quot;Ratinho&#x27;s Show&quot;, with a similar format to &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;), &quot;Show do Milhão&quot; (&quot;The Million Show&quot;, similar to &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;), &quot;Topa Tudo por Dinheiro&quot; (&quot;Variety show large audience that was aired on Sunday night between 1991 and 2001&quot;), &quot;Fantasia&quot; (Entertainment program where people could play games by phoning the program in order to earn money), and the Brazilian version of the Argentinean soap opera &quot;Chiquititas&quot;, popular with children.

For over 20 years the SBT held second place in the Brazilian television ratings (behind Rede Globo), but in February 2007 it was outpaced by Rede Record for the first time in São Paulo. However, after a period of resurgence which started in 2011, SBT successfully overtook Record for second place in June 2014.

Since their 1990s peak in popularity, Mexican &quot;telenovelas&quot; have been steadily declining in the ratings; the last popular Mexican soap operas were &quot;Carita de Ángel&quot; in the early 2000s and &quot;Rebelde&quot; in 2006. In 2001, SBT began remaking Mexican soaps with Brazilian actors. The first soaps (&quot;Picara Sonhadora&quot; and &quot;Marisol&quot;) did fairly well in the ratings; however, later soaps (&quot;Cristal&quot;, &quot;Os Ricos Também Choram&quot; and &quot;Maria Esperança&quot;, a version of the popular &quot;Maria Mercedes&quot;) were less popular.

In addition to Mexican soaps and their remakes, the channel also airs cartoons mornings and programs such as &quot;Ídolos&quot; (a Brazilian version of &quot;American Idol&quot; which later moved to TV Record), a Brazilian version of &quot;Supernanny&quot;, a version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; (presented by Silvio Santos, who also presents many network programs), talent shows and a dating show. The network also airs movies and &quot;A Praça é Nossa&quot; (a long-running, popular comedy program).

<text>In physics, specifically relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) and its applications to particle physics, relativistic wave equations predict the behavior of particles at high energies and velocities comparable to the speed of light. In the context of quantum field theory (QFT), the equations determine the dynamics of quantum fields.
The solutions to the equations, universally denoted as or (Greek psi), are referred to as &quot;wave functions&quot; in the context of RQM, and &quot;fields&quot; in the context of QFT. The equations themselves are called &quot;wave equations&quot; or &quot;field equations&quot;, because they have the mathematical form of a wave equation or are generated from a Lagrangian density and the field-theoretic Euler–Lagrange equations (see classical field theory for background).

In the Schrödinger picture, the wave function or field is the solution to the Schrödinger equation;
formula_1
one of the postulates of quantum mechanics. All relativistic wave equations can be constructed by specifying various forms of the Hamiltonian operator &quot;Ĥ&quot; describing the quantum system. Alternatively, Feynman&#x27;s path integral formulation uses a Lagrangian rather than a Hamiltonian operator.

More generally – the modern formalism behind relativistic wave equations is Lorentz group theory, wherein the spin of the particle has a correspondence with the representations of the Lorentz group.

== History ==

=== Early 1920s: Classical and quantum mechanics ===

The failure of classical mechanics applied to molecular, atomic, and nuclear systems and smaller induced the need for a new mechanics: &quot;quantum mechanics&quot;. The mathematical formulation was led by De Broglie, Bohr, Schrödinger, Pauli, and Heisenberg, and others, around the mid-1920s, and at that time was analogous to that of classical mechanics. The Schrödinger equation and the Heisenberg picture resemble the classical equations of motion in the limit of large quantum numbers and as the reduced Planck constant , the quantum of action, tends to zero. This is the correspondence principle. At this point, special relativity was not fully combined with quantum mechanics, so the Schrödinger and Heisenberg formulations, as originally proposed, could not be used in situations where the particles travel near the speed of light, or when the number of each type of particle changes (this happens in real particle interactions; the numerous forms of particle decays, annihilation, matter creation, pair production, and so on).

=== Late 1920s: Relativistic quantum mechanics of spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles ===

A description of quantum mechanical systems which could account for &quot;relativistic&quot; effects was sought for by many theoretical physicists from the late 1920s to the mid-1940s. The first basis for relativistic quantum mechanics, i.e. special relativity applied with quantum mechanics together, was found by all those who discovered what is frequently called the Klein–Gordon equation:

by inserting the energy operator and momentum operator into the relativistic energy–momentum relation:
The solutions to () are scalar fields. The KG equation is undesirable due to its prediction of &quot;negative&quot; energies and probabilities, as a result of the quadratic nature of () – inevitable in a relativistic theory. This equation was initially proposed by Schrödinger, and he discarded it for such reasons, only to realize a few months later that its non-relativistic limit (what is now called the Schrödinger equation) was still of importance. Nevertheless, () is applicable to spin-0 bosons.

Neither the non-relativistic nor relativistic equations found by Schrödinger could predict the fine structure in the Hydrogen spectral series. The mysterious underlying property was &quot;spin&quot;. The first two-dimensional &quot;spin matrices&quot; (better known as the Pauli matrices) were introduced by Pauli in the Pauli equation; the Schrödinger equation with a non-relativistic Hamiltonian including an extra term for particles in magnetic fields, but this was &quot;phenomenological&quot;. Weyl found a relativistic equation in terms of the Pauli matrices; the Weyl equation, for &quot;massless&quot; spin- fermions. The problem was resolved by Dirac in the late 1920s, when he furthered the application of equation () to the electron – by various manipulations he factorized the equation into the form:

and one of these factors is the Dirac equation (see below), upon inserting the energy and momentum operators. For the first time, this introduced new four-dimensional spin matrices and in a relativistic wave equation, and explained the fine structure of hydrogen. The solutions to () are multi-component spinor fields, and each component satisfies (). A remarkable result of spinor solutions is that half of the components describe a particle while the other half describe an antiparticle; in this case the electron and positron. The Dirac equation is now known to apply for all massive spin- fermions. In the non-relativistic limit, the Pauli equation is recovered, while the massless case results in the Weyl equation.

Although a landmark in quantum theory, the Dirac equation is only true for spin- fermions, and still predicts negative energy solutions, which caused controversy at the time (in particular – not all physicists were comfortable with the &quot;Dirac sea&quot; of negative energy states).

=== 1930s–1960s: Relativistic quantum mechanics of higher-spin particles ===

The natural problem became clear: to generalize the Dirac equation to particles with &quot;any spin&quot;; both fermions and bosons, and in the same equations their antiparticles (possible because of the spinor formalism introduced by Dirac in his equation, and then-recent developments in spinor calculus by van der Waerden in 1929), and ideally with positive energy solutions.

This was introduced and solved by Majorana in 1932, by a deviated approach to Dirac. Majorana considered one &quot;root&quot; of ():

where is a spinor field now with infinitely many components, irreducible to a finite number of tensors or spinors, to remove the indeterminacy in sign. The matrices and are infinite-dimensional matrices, related to infinitesimal Lorentz transformations. He did not demand that each component of satisfy equation (); instead he regenerated the equation using a Lorentz-invariant action, via the principle of least action, and application of Lorentz group theory.

Majorana produced other important contributions that were unpublished, including wave equations of various dimensions (5, 6, and 16). They were anticipated later (in a more involved way) by de Broglie (1934), and Duffin, Kemmer, and Petiau (around 1938–1939) see Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau algebra. The Dirac–Fierz–Pauli formalism was more sophisticated than Majorana&#x27;s, as spinors were new mathematical tools in the early twentieth century, although Majorana&#x27;s paper of 1932 was difficult to fully understand; it took Pauli and Wigner some time to understand it, around 1940.

Dirac in 1936, and Fierz and Pauli in 1939, built equations from irreducible spinors and , symmetric in all indices, for a massive particle of spin for integer (see Van der Waerden notation for the meaning of the dotted indices):
A_{\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\cdots\epsilon_n}^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}_1\dot{\beta}_2\cdots\dot{\beta}_n} = mcB_{\gamma\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\cdots\epsilon_n}^{\dot{\beta}_1\dot{\beta}_2\cdots\dot{\beta}_n}
&lt;/math&gt;|}}
B_{\gamma\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\cdots\epsilon_n}^{\dot{\beta}_1\dot{\beta}_2\cdots\dot{\beta}_n} = mcA_{\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\cdots\epsilon_n}^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}_1\dot{\beta}_2\cdots\dot{\beta}_n} 
&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where is the momentum as a covariant spinor operator. For , the equations reduce to the coupled Dirac equations and and together transform as the original Dirac spinor. Eliminating either or shows that and each fulfill (). The direct derivation of the Dirac-Pauli-Fierz equations using the Bargmann-Wigner operators is given in.

In 1941, Rarita and Schwinger focussed on spin- particles and derived the Rarita–Schwinger equation, including a Lagrangian to generate it, and later generalized the equations analogous to spin for integer . In 1945, Pauli suggested Majorana&#x27;s 1932 paper to Bhabha, who returned to the general ideas introduced by Majorana in 1932. Bhabha and Lubanski proposed a completely general set of equations by replacing the mass terms in () and () by an arbitrary constant, subject to a set of conditions which the wave functions must obey.

Finally, in the year 1948 (the same year as Feynman&#x27;s path integral formulation was cast), Bargmann and Wigner formulated the general equation for massive particles which could have any spin, by considering the Dirac equation with a totally symmetric finite-component spinor, and using Lorentz group theory (as Majorana did): the Bargmann–Wigner equations. In the early 1960s, a reformulation of the Bargmann–Wigner equations was made by H. Joos and Steven Weinberg, the Joos–Weinberg equation. Various theorists at this time did further research in relativistic Hamiltonians for higher spin particles.

=== 1960s–present ===

The relativistic description of spin particles has been a difficult problem in quantum theory. It is still an area of the present-day research because the problem is only partially solved; including interactions in the equations is problematic, and paradoxical predictions (even from the Dirac equation) are still present.

== Linear equations ==

The following equations have solutions which satisfy the superposition principle, that is, the wave functions are additive.

Throughout, the standard conventions of tensor index notation and Feynman slash notation are used, including Greek indices which take the values 1, 2, 3 for the spatial components and 0 for the timelike component of the indexed quantities. The wave functions are denoted &quot;&quot;, and are the components of the four-gradient operator.

In matrix equations, the Pauli matrices are denoted by in which , where is the identity matrix:
formula_2
and the other matrices have their usual representations. The expression
formula_3
is a matrix operator which acts on 2-component spinor fields.

The gamma matrices are denoted by , in which again , and there are a number of representations to select from. The matrix is &quot;not&quot; necessarily the identity matrix. The expression
formula_4
is a matrix operator which acts on 4-component spinor fields.

Note that terms such as &quot;&quot; scalar multiply an identity matrix of the relevant dimension, the common sizes are or , and are &quot;conventionally&quot; not written for simplicity.

=== Linear gauge fields ===

The Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation is an alternative equation for spin-0 and spin-1 particles:
formula_5

== Constructing RWEs ==

=== Using 4-vectors and the energy–momentum relation ===
Start with the standard special relativity (SR) 4-vectors
* 4-position formula_6
* 4-velocity formula_7
* 4-momentum formula_8
* 4-wavevector formula_9
* 4-gradient formula_10

Note that each 4-vector is related to another by a Lorentz scalar:
* formula_11, where formula_12 is the proper time
* formula_13, where formula_14 is the rest mass
* formula_15, which is the 4-vector version of the Planck–Einstein relation &amp; the de Broglie matter wave relation
* formula_16, which is the 4-gradient version of complex-valued plane waves

Now, just apply the standard Lorentz scalar product rule to each one:
* formula_17
* formula_18
* formula_19
* formula_20
The last equation is a fundamental quantum relation.

When applied to a Lorentz scalar field formula_21, one gets the Klein–Gordon equation, the most basic of the quantum relativistic wave equations.
* formula_22: in 4-vector format
* formula_23: in tensor format
* formula_24: in factored tensor format

The Schrödinger equation is the low-velocity limiting case () of the Klein–Gordon equation.

When the relation is applied to a four-vector field formula_25 instead of a Lorentz scalar field formula_21, then one gets the Proca equation (in Lorenz gauge):
formula_27

If the rest mass term is set to zero (light-like particles), then this gives the free Maxwell equation (in Lorenz gauge)
formula_28

=== Representations of the Lorentz group ===

Under a proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation in Minkowski space, all one-particle quantum states of spin with spin z-component locally transform under some representation of the Lorentz group:
formula_29
where is some finite-dimensional representation, i.e. a matrix. Here is thought of as a column vector containing components with the allowed values of . The quantum numbers and as well as other labels, continuous or discrete, representing other quantum numbers are suppressed. One value of may occur more than once depending on the representation. Representations with several possible values for are considered below.

The irreducible representations are labeled by a pair of half-integers or integers . From these all other representations can be built up using a variety of standard methods, like taking tensor products and direct sums. In particular, space-time itself constitutes a 4-vector representation so that . To put this into context; Dirac spinors transform under the representation. In general, the representation space has subspaces that under the subgroup of spatial rotations, SO(3), transform irreducibly like objects of spin &quot;j&quot;, where each allowed value:
formula_30
occurs exactly once. In general, &quot;tensor products of irreducible representations&quot; are reducible; they decompose as direct sums of irreducible representations.

The representations and can each separately represent particles of spin . A state or quantum field in such a representation would satisfy no field equation except the Klein–Gordon equation.

== Non-linear equations ==
There are equations which have solutions that do not satisfy the superposition principle.

=== Nonlinear gauge fields ===
* Yang–Mills equation: describes a non-abelian gauge field
* Yang–Mills–Higgs equations: describes a non-abelian gauge field coupled with a massive spin-0 particle

=== Spin 2 ===
* Einstein field equations: describe interaction of matter with the gravitational field (massless spin-2 field): formula_31 The solution is a metric tensor field, rather than a wave function.

<text>Bethlehem Works is a development site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, based on land formerly owned by Bethlehem Steel.

After Bethlehem Steel discontinued its steelmaking activities at the main Bethlehem plant in 1995 after about 140 years of metal production, outside consultants developed concept plans for the reuse of the property. The plan was to rename the site &quot;Bethlehem Works&quot; and to use the land for cultural, recreational, educational, entertainment and retail development, including the Smithsonian Institution, an educational and research institution.

==Timeline==
===1995===
Spring - Adaptive land use and environmental consultants retained by Bethlehem Steel to explore new uses for land to be vacated by the transition from steelmaking.

November - Bethlehem Steel ends about 140 years of metal production on the south shore of the Lehigh River.

===1996===
Winter - Brandenburg Industrial Services, Inc. begins site remediation by removing buildings that are not architecturally or historically significant or structurally viable for new uses.

April - Bethlehem City Council approves zoning changes of the 163 acres (0.7 km2) of land owned by Bethlehem Steel between the Minsi Trail and Fahy Bridges. The land, formerly zoned &quot;heavy industrial,&quot; has been rezoned to permit a wide range of redevelopment projects.

April - Discovery Center of Science and Technology agrees to purchase former Bethlehem Plant office building to house an interactive museum for children.

December - Enterprise Development Company is named the master developer for the 163 acre (0.7 km2) tract of land between the Minsi Trail and Fahy Bridges. The tract is now known as Bethlehem Works and will feature entertainment, cultural, recreational and retail establishments.

===1997===
February - Bethlehem Steel Corporation signs a memorandum of understanding with the Smithsonian Institution for the long-term loan of artifacts to be exhibited in a new museum, the National Museum of Industrial History, that will be affiliated with the Smithsonian.

August - Headquarters for the Bethlehem Works revitalization effort are now open at 530 East Third Street in Bethlehem that establish a presence for Enterprise Development Company, the project&#x27;s master developer. The building, located across from the Discovery Center and the former Main Gate, gives Enterprise staff and visitors easy access to the Bethlehem Works&#x27; site.

November - The Master Plan for Bethlehem Works was reviewed with the community in a public meeting. The economic impact was revealed to be a $450 million investment that will create 2,500 full-time equivalent jobs and produce more than $20 million each year in tax revenue to local and state taxing authorities.

===1998===
Winter - Master plan approved by City of Bethlehem&#x27;s Planning Commission following the plan&#x27;s unveiling to the community in late 1997. 
Fall - Infrastructure improvement grants through the federal Transportation and Efficiency Act for the 21st century were authorized by the U.S. Congress. The Bethlehem Works project will receive $3 million for public access way improvements as work is ready to begin.

Fall - Funding for public infrastructure improvements for roadways leading to Bethlehem Works is included in the longer-range budget process of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Local monies to match the anticipated PennDOT allocation are being pursued with the City of Bethlehem.

Fall - Bethlehem Steel is preparing a proposal for funding through a &quot;brownfields&quot; initiative from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to support infrastructure improvements.

===1999===
February - Industrial artifacts from the 19th century moved to Bethlehem on a long-term loan basis from the Smithsonian Institution to the National Museum of Industrial History. The Preview Center will be affiliated with the Smithsonian and will showcase artifacts that will be moved to the permanent 300,000 ft2 (28,000 m2) museum that will have a planned opening in the plant&#x27;s No. 2 machine shop in 2004. 
February - Designated developer is named for former headquarters building to become a 262-room, full-service hotel with an adjacent conference center. Castlebrook Development (formerly known as Wynco), a real estate development group located in Pittsburgh, is expected to partner with a national hotel chain under whose flag the hotel will operate.

April - Ground broken for the John M. Cook Technology Center-a 36,250 ft2 (3,368 m2) post incubator facility for development of high-tech business start-ups.

June - Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection approved the remediation plan for Bethlehem Works and called the 1,800 acre (7 km2) Bethlehem Works and Bethlehem Commerce Center initiatives &quot;a national model for brownfields development.&quot;

August - Designated developer is named for a family fun center to be known as &quot;The Fundry at Bethlehem Works.&quot; James Lewis of Lewiston, N.Y., a developer of other family fun centers, plans up to 100,000 ft2 (9,000 m2) of space in the existing carpenter shop and a new structure adjacent to the existing building.

November - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge presents the Governor&#x27;s Award for Environmental Excellence to Bethlehem Steel Corporation for its remediation process that will expedite the return of the Bethlehem Works property to productive use.

December - The City of Bethlehem&#x27;s Planning Commission approved the subdivision plan and infrastructure improvements for Phase 1 of Bethlehem Works.

December - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge presented $4.5 million to help build the Preview Center for the National Museum of Industrial History. The project was enabled in February 1998 when the General Assembly approved Governor Ridge&#x27;s plan to fund vital community and economic development projects statewide.

===2000===
February - Letter of Designation is signed with Armada/Hoffler of Chesapeake, Va., to develop a multiplex cinema and up to 175,000 ft2 (16,000 m2) of retail space.

April - Infrastructure funding in place to facilitate construction of roads and utility systems.

April - John M. Cook Technology Center opens adjacent to Bethlehem Works on land formerly owned by Bethlehem Steel. Cook Technology Center and neighboring Tech Center I, opened in 1993, house high-tech start-up businesses.

September - Bids for the infrastructure for the first phase of Bethlehem Works construction are being advertised by the city of Bethlehem.

November - Heralding &quot;a new beginning for an old place&quot; ground was broken for the installation of infrastructure for the first phase of Bethlehem Works.

<text>The Cambridge Apostles (also known as the Conversazione Society) is an intellectual society at the University of Cambridge founded in 1820 by George Tomlinson, a Cambridge student who became the first Bishop of Gibraltar.

== History ==
Student George Tomlinson founded what he called the &quot;Conversazione Society&quot; at the University of Cambridge on 1 April 1820. This intellectual society soon was called the Cambridge Apostles because of its twelve original members. These founding members were it seems Tory, evangelical Anglican students from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. New members were invited and elected to membership by the extant membership. Membership and activities of the society are secret, but the society has met regularly for at least 150 years. 

The Apostles was essentially formed as a discussion group to explore and debate, in a small group, questions of philosophy, politics, ethics, governance, and religion, inter alia. Meetings were held once per week, traditionally on Saturday evenings, during which one member would give a prepared talk on a topic (or a question for debate) that was then thrown open for discussion. Members also shared poetry and dance lessons. In the early 20th century, the Cambridge Apostles were considered by some &quot;as a haven for overt, full-blooded—almost aggressive—homosexuality.&quot; After reading her son&#x27;s letters, one Apostle&#x27;s mother called the group &quot;a hotbed of vice&quot;.

The Apostles first admitted women in the 1970s. As of 2023, the society&#x27;s annual dinner has become &quot;a somewhat erratic occurrence&quot;. Its last known members graduated from Cambridge in the 1970s, leading one writer to question whether or not the Apostles are still active. The Apostles&#x27; papers, through 1930, are housed at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, archives.

==Traditions ==
The members would meet weekly to eat sardines on toast, called whales, and discuss an essay written by a member. The debate at each meeting was called the discussion on the Hearth Rug because the speaker stands with the moderator on a hearth rug when speaking if one were present.

The Apostles retained minutes of meetings and a leather diary of their membership, the Photo Book, stretching back to its founding. These include handwritten notes about the topics on which each member had spoken. It was included in the so-called Ark, a cedar chest containing a collection of papers about the topics discussed and the results of votes on the propositions nominated for debate. It was a point of honour that the question voted upon should bear only a tangential relationship to the matter debated.

Active members were referred to as Apostles; they called each other Brethren. After retirement from the society, Apostles were said to &quot;take wings&quot; and become Angels. Undergraduates applied to become Angels after graduating or being awarded a fellowship. Every few years, amid great secrecy, all the Angels were invited to an Apostles&#x27; dinner at a Cambridge college. There used to be an annual dinner, usually held in London.

== Membership ==
There are only twelve members at any given time, and membership is secret.

Membership consisted largely of undergraduates, but there have been graduate students and members who already have held university and college posts. The society traditionally drew most of its members from Christ&#x27;s, St John&#x27;s, Jesus, Trinity and King&#x27;s Colleges, although, in the 20th century, the majority of its members came from King&#x27;s and Trinity. Women first were elected into the society in the 1970s, though the question &quot;Should we like to elect women&quot; was put (and the division upon it apparently won) at a much earlier meeting.

Undergraduates being considered for membership were called embryos and were invited to embryo parties, where members judged whether the student should be invited to join. The embryos attended these parties without knowing they were being considered for membership. Becoming an Apostle involved taking an oath of secrecy and listening to the reading of a curse, originally written by Apostle Fenton John Anthony Hort, the theologian, on the occasion of the resignation of Henry John Roby from the Apostles after his joining in 1855.

== Notable members ==
Alfred Tennyson joined the Apostles in 1829, probably through the invitation of his friend Arthur Hallam. Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore joined as students, as did John Maynard Keynes, who invited Ludwig Wittgenstein to join. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group&#x27;s unseriousness and style of humour. He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the level of the discussion on the Hearth Rug. He also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Moral Sciences Club. He rejoined in the 1920s when he returned to Cambridge.

Soviet spies Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess and John Cairncross, three of the Cambridge Five, and Michael Straight were all members of the Apostles in the early 1930s.

<text>Wovoka ( – September 20, 1932), also known as Jack Wilson, was the Paiute religious leader who founded a second episode of the Ghost Dance movement. Wovoka means &quot;cutter&quot; or &quot;wood cutter&quot; in the Northern Paiute language.

==Biography==
Wovoka was born in the Smith Valley area southeast of Carson City, Nevada around 1856. Quoitze Ow was his birth name. Wovoka&#x27;s father was Numu-tibo&#x27;o (sometimes called Tavibo), who for several decades was incorrectly believed to be Wodziwob, a religious leader who had founded the Ghost Dance of 1870. From the age of eight until almost thirty Wovoka often worked for David Wilson, a rancher in the Yerington, Nevada, area, and his wife Abigail, who gave him the name Jack Wilson when dealing with Euro-Americans. David Wilson was a devout Christian, and Wovoka learned Christian theology and Bible stories while living with him.

One of his chief sources of authority among Paiutes was his alleged ability to control the weather. He was said to have caused a block of ice to fall out of the sky on a summer day, to be able to end drought with rain or snow, to light his pipe with the sun, and to form icicles in his hands.

Wovoka claimed to have had a prophetic vision after falling into a coma during the solar eclipse of January 1, 1889. Wovoka&#x27;s vision entailed the resurrection of the Paiute dead, and the removal of whites and their works from North America. Wovoka taught that to bring this vision to pass, the Native Americans must live righteously and perform a traditional round dance known as the Ghost Dance.

Wovoka&#x27;s prophetic message referenced several Christian theological concepts. In the &quot;Messiah Letters&quot;, Wovoka spoke of Jesus Christ&#x27;s life on Earth and likened the foretold redemption of Native Americans to a biblical Judgement Day. Wovoka made references to the reunion of the living and the dead, and also advocated for non-violence in the Christian spirit of pacifism and fair temperament. The Ghost Dance embodied many of these Christian principles in its imagery and symbolism.

Anthropologists, historians, and theologians provide conflicting accounts of when and how Wovoka had his vision. One scholar of religions, Tom Thatcher, cites James Mooney&#x27;s Smithsonian-sponsored anthropological report to claim that Wovoka received his first vision while chopping wood for David Wilson in 1887. Conversely, historian Paul Bailey utilized Mooney&#x27;s work along with interviews with Wovoka&#x27;s contemporaries and interpreters to assert that he received the vision after entering a two-day trance, awaking in tears. Regardless, shortly after receiving the vision and its message, it moved quickly beyond his local Paiute community by word of mouth to Native American tribes further east, notably the Lakota.

The Ghost Dance movement is known for being practiced by the victims of the Wounded Knee Massacre. Before the Ghost Dance reached Native Americans on South Dakota plains reservations, interest in the movement came from the U.S. Indian Office, the U.S. War Department, and multiple Native American tribal delegations. As the movement spread across the American West, various interpretations of Wovoka&#x27;s original message were adopted, notably by the Lakota Sioux living on the Pine Ridge reservation. The Lakota interpretation was considered more militant, placing additional emphasis on the foretold elimination of White men. Although the Lakota interpretation promoted hostility toward US federal agents, it did not explicitly advocate for violent action. Historical evidence suggests that the unconventional practice of Christianity on the part of the Lakota tribe was largely responsible for the tensions between Whites and Native Americans leading up to the Battle at Wounded Knee. US authorities challenged the theological views of the Ghost Dance movement and arguably sought conflict with the Lakota tribe as a means of condemning these practices. Wovoka never left his home in Nevada to become an active participant in the dance&#x27;s dissemination in the U.S. interior.

Indian Agents, soldiers, and other federal officials tended to have a hostile and sometimes violent attitude toward the movement.

==Post-Wounded Knee life and death==
Wovoka was disheartened by how events unfolded at the massacre. He remained a prominent Native American leader until his death. Sometime between 1894 and 1896, he was reported to have been a sideshow attraction at a San Francisco Midwinter Fair Carnival. In 1917, an agent for the Nevada Agency named L.A. Dorrington tracked down Wovoka to report his whereabouts to Washington. Curious to see if the former Native American messiah had any ties to the Native American Church, Dorrington found that Wovoka was instead living a humble life in Mason, Nevada. He abstained from the practice, worked as an occasional medicine man, and traveled to events on reservations across the United States.

Wovoka died in Yerington on September 20, 1932, and is interred in the Paiute Cemetery in the town of Schurz, Nevada.

==In popular culture==

Native American band Redbone named their 1973 album &quot;Wovoka&quot;, and the title song, after the prophet.

In the 1971 film &quot;Billy Jack&quot;, Billy, played by Tom Laughlin, teaches the Ghost Dance to Indians and students of the Montessori Freedom School. In the moments leading up to this session, Billy&#x27;s girlfriend Jean (played by Laughlin&#x27;s wife, Delores Taylor) explains Wovoka and the Ghost Dance to an abused teenage girl hiding from her abusive father at the school. Jean says that once, even Christ appeared to Wovoka.

In 1988 &#x27;Ghost Dance&#x27; was remastered and reissued on the eponymous &#x27;Death Cult&#x27; compact disc. Reaching No. 2 on the UK Independent Chart when initially released in July 1983. Ian Astbury (singer and songwriter with Billy Duffy) spent formative years in Canada in which his part Native American heritage was to become a small but important part of his songwriting. &quot;Wovoka had a vision; His words went far and wide - Save our once great nation, and dance the dance of Pride.&quot;.

<text>Piapot, Payipwât, or Payipwat (Hole in the Sioux or One Who Knows the Secrets of the Sioux), born as Kisikawasan (Flash in the Sky), known by his Assiniboine allies as Maȟpíya owáde hókši (Lightning In The Sky Boy) (–April 1908) was a Native Canadian chief of the Cree-Assiniboine / Young Dogs Band, a mighty band and division of the &quot;Downstream People (Māmihkiyiniwak)&quot; of the Plains Cree. He was one of the five major leaders of the Plains Cree after 1860.

== Early life ==

Most likely born near what is now the border of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Payipwat was originally named Kisikawasan, or Flash in the Sky. Along with his grandmother, Payipwat was kidnapped by the Sioux as a child. He grew up among his captors, learning their medicine. At fourteen, Payipwat was captured during a Cree raid and returned to his own people. He was given the name Payipwat, literally Hole in the Sioux, in recognition of the knowledge he had gained while living among the Sioux. His name is often translated as &quot;One Who Knows the Secrets of the Sioux&quot;.

== Invasion of Cypress Hills ==

By 1860 Payipwat had become a spiritual leader among the Cree. At the same time, he had become chief of the Cree-Assiniboine or Young Dogs, a particularly powerful mixed band of Cree and Cree-speaking Assiniboine as well as some Plains Ojibwe. This band was known by the Cree as &quot;Nēhiyawi-pwātak&quot; (Cree-Assiniboine) and by the Assiniboine as &quot;Sahiyaiyeskabi&quot; or &quot;šahíya iyéskabina&quot; (&quot;Cree-Speakers&quot;, because they had switched to speaking Cree). Members of the band were renowned as great buffalo hunters and warriors, as well as horse-thieves and troublemakers. As his band depended on the declining buffalo herds, Payipwat advocated for the Cree to expand their territory into the Cypress Hills. Payipwat was an important leader of the ensuing invasion; however, in a dream, he had a vision of Cree defeat. He was unable to persuade the other leaders of his vision, but he refused to participate in the battle the next day in which the Cree attacked a Kainai village. The &quot;Battle of the Belly River&quot; was disastrous for the Cree, who lost a third of their warriors, and essentially marked the end of the invasion.

== Treaty 4 ==

In 1875 Payipwat met with William J. Christie, Canadian treaty commissioner. Christie wanted Payipwat to sign Treaty 4, which had been negotiated a year earlier. Payipwat demanded several changes to the treaty and, incorrectly believing that they had been made, signed it on September 9, 1875. Although many of his requests were provided by the government as part of future treaties (particularly Treaty 6), several were not. Until his death, Payipwat felt betrayed by Ottawa.

Over the next decade Payipwat continued to negotiate with the Canadian government. He and other Cree leaders refused to sign any additional treaties unless the Crown guaranteed the autonomy of the Cree people and grant them a united territory. When it became clear that this would not happen, Payipwat, Cree leaders Cowessess and Foremost Man, and the Assiniboine First Nations all requested reserves in the Cypress Hills. The requested territories were all adjacent, and Ottawa agreed to the request, effectively granting the tribe the united territory it sought.

== Rebellion ==

In 1882, facing starvation due to the declining buffalo herds, Payipwat and the Young Dogs agreed to leave the Cypress Hills in exchange for food, horses and supplies. However they returned in short order. The next year he again agreed to leave, this time to Indian Head, Assiniboia, and was escorted there by the North-West Mounted Police.

Once he arrived in Indian Head, Payipwat immediately set about organizing his people again with the goal of establishing their own territory. Payipwat again achieved some success. He gained permission to establish a new reserve immediately adjacent to another existing Cree reserve. He joined with other leaders of tribes subject to Treaties 4 and 6 to pressure Ottawa for treaty revisions.

However, in 1885 the government exploited the Métis North-West Rebellion to crack down on the Cree. A military fort was established next to Payipwat&#x27;s reserve. Several other leaders were arrested as rebels. Payipwat was the only leader to survive, and he was closely monitored by the police and military.

== Later years ==

Payipwat continued to be a respected spiritual leader among the Cree and continued to advocate for greater autonomy and promote the preservation of Cree culture. He was distrusted by the government.

In 1902 Indian Agent William Morris Graham attempted to have Payipwat deposed as chief for incompetence. He eventually succeeded when he had the chief arrested for holding a Thirst Dance, a ceremony which had been banned in 1892. On April 15, 1902, the federal government removed Payipwat as chief. Payipwat met with Governor General Lord Minto in September of that year. The Governor General was persuaded to advocate for the lifting of the ban on the dances, but was unsuccessful.

In April 1908, Payipwat died on his reserve.

<text>Ivan Gašparovič (; ; born 27 March 1941) is a Slovak politician and lawyer who was the third president of Slovakia from 2004 to 2014. He was also the first and currently the only Slovak president to be re-elected.

==Biography==
Ivan Gašparovič was born in Poltár, near Lučenec and Banská Bystrica in present-day south-central Slovakia, which was at that time the first Slovak Republic. His father, Vladimir Gašparović, emigrated to Czechoslovakia from Rijeka in modern-day Croatia at the end of World War I and was a teacher at a secondary school in Bratislava, and at one point its Headmaster. Gašparovič studied at the law faculty of the Comenius University in Bratislava, which is the main university in Slovakia, from 1959 to 1964. He worked in the District Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of the district of Martin (1965–66), then became a Prosecutor at the Municipal Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Bratislava (1966–68). In 1968, he joined the Communist Party of Slovakia, supposedly to support Alexander Dubček&#x27;s reforms, but he was expelled from the party after the Warsaw Pact invasion in Czechoslovakia in August 1968.

==Early career==

However, in spite of his expulsion, Gašparovič was able to continue his legal career and from 1968 to July 1990, he was a teacher at the Department of Criminal Law, Criminology and Criminological Practice at the law faculty of the Comenius University in Bratislava. In February 1990, he became the prorector (deputy vice-chancellor) of Comenius University.

After the Velvet Revolution and the subsequent fall of the Communist regime, Gašparovič was chosen by the newly elected democratic president Václav Havel to become the country&#x27;s federal Prosecutor-General. After March 1992, he was briefly the Vice-President of the Legislative Council of Czechoslovakia, before the federal Czechoslovakia split into two independent states in January 1993. Gašparovič temporarily returned to the Comenius University law faculty. He was a member of the Scientific Council of the Comenius University and of the Scientific Council of the law faculty of the same university. In late 1992, he was one of the authors of the Constitution of Slovakia.

In 1992 Gašparovič joined the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS, &quot;Hnutie za demokratické Slovensko&quot;), led by Vladimír Mečiar. Gašparovič was one of the central figures of Prime Minister Mečiar&#x27;s administration. He became Speaker of the National Council of the Slovak Republic (NRSR) after the victory of the HZDS in the June 1992 elections. When a scandal erupted over the discovery of microphones in the U.S. Consulate in November 1992, Gašparovič was asked by Mečiar to head a commission to investigate the background of the affair, but the results were inconclusive. Later that year, when Mečiar&#x27;s government attempted to close down the opposition-led Trnava University, Gašparovič sided with the Prime Minister, echoing his argument that its opening was &quot;illegal.&quot; The West viewed Mečiar&#x27;s government as untrustworthy, and the country was excluded from the EU and NATO expansion talks that went on at the time at the neighbouring central European countries.

The period of the HZDS rule was among other things marked by persistent animosity between the HZDS-led government and the country&#x27;s President Michal Kováč, a vocal opponent of Mečiar. The conflict had gotten to the point where the Slovak Secret Service SIS was alleged to have kidnapped the president&#x27;s son, Michal Jr., plying him with alcohol, and dropping him in front of a police station in Hainburg in Austria, a country where he was wanted on suspicion of financial fraud.

A part of this continuous feud was Gašparovič&#x27;s widely publicized derogatory comment made in reference to President Kováč not being aware that the parliamentary microphone was on, calling Kováč &quot;an old dick&quot; {&quot;starý chuj&quot;}.

From October 1998 to 15 July 2002, when his HZDS was an opposition party, Gašparovič was a member of the parliamentary Committee for the Supervision of the SIS (the Slovak equivalent of CIA). He was also a member of the delegation of the Slovak parliament in the Interparliamentary Union.

In July 2002 after four years in opposition Gašparovič left the HZDS after Mečiar decided not to include him and some other HZDS members on the ballot for the upcoming elections. Gašparovič along with the other members immediately (on 12 July) founded a new party, the &quot;Hnutie za demokraciu&quot; (HZD) Movement for Democracy, a name bearing a close resemblance to his former HZDS. The cited reasons for the departure were internal disputes within the party, or as Gašparovič put it in an interview with The Slovak Spectator, &quot;differences of opinion with HZDS leader [Vladimír] Mečiar, mostly about the leadership of the party.&quot; In the September 2002 elections his party polled 3.3 percent, not enough to win seats in the parliament. After the elections, Gašparovič returned to the law faculty of the Comenius University, and wrote several university textbooks as well as working papers and studies on criminal law.

In April 2004 Gašparovič decided to run for the presidency against Vladimír Mečiar and the then governing coalition&#x27;s candidate Eduard Kukan. In an unexpected turn of events, the perceived underdog Gašparovič received the second highest number of votes and moved on to the second round, once again facing Mečiar. The main factor for Gašparovič&#x27;s first round success was the low turnout of the front-runner Kukan&#x27;s electorate, as Kukan was generally considered to be a sure bet for the second round. In other words, the majority of the population viewed the first round as a formality, and was saving their effort for the second round to keep Mečiar at bay. Hence in the second round the (potential) Eduard Kukan voters faced an uneasy choice between two representatives of the past regime. Ultimately, Gašparovič, regarded by Mečiar opponents as the &quot;lesser evil&quot;, was elected as the president (see 2004 Slovakia presidential election).

==President of Slovakia==

Gašparovič&#x27;s toned down and non-confrontational approach to presidency has increased his popularity with many voters, and he is a generally popular president now. However, to date he has remained unapologetic about his role in the Mečiar&#x27;s regime, which is generally perceived to have set back Slovakia&#x27;s post-communist political and economic progress and development. Gašparovič was supported by the Direction – Social Democracy of Prime Minister Robert Fico and the Slovak National Party a nationalist and populist party led by Jan Slota.

===Controversies===
In a 23 August 2011 statement, Gašparovič opposed erecting a sculpture in memory of controversial Hungarian minority politician János Esterházy in Kosice, saying that the one-time deputy had been a follower of Hitler and fascism. He also opposed Ferdinand Ďurčanský&#x27;s sculpture for similar reasons. According to Hungarian President Pál Schmitt, Esterházy rejected both fascism and communism, suffered in the Gulag and died in a Moravian prison in 1957.

Marek Trubac, the Slovak president&#x27;s spokesman, told MTI that Esterházy is considered a war criminal in Slovakia, &quot;for supporting fascist ideology&quot;. Though Esterházy did vote against the law about deportations of Jews, he also welcomed (former Hungarian regent) Horthy&#x27;s &quot;fascist troops&quot; that occupied Kosice, the spokesman added.

He has also become well known for his misspeaks that are often topics of conversations and jokes among Slovak public (e.g. referring to a letter by &quot;white on black&quot; instead of &quot;black on white&quot; or referring to United Nations (Slovak translation is &quot;Organization of connected nations&quot; Slovak: Organizácia spojených národov) as &quot;Organization of connected tumors&quot; Slovak: Organizácia spojených nádorov).

Political controversy followed him by his non-decision on naming new attorney general that had been elected by Slovak parliament as the president did not respect the vote and declined to name the attorney general into the function and caused on-going (July 2013) political crisis in Slovakia.

==Private life==
In 1964, Gašparovič married Silvia Beníková, with whom he has two children. His favorite sport is ice hockey.

<text>Sussan Penelope Ley (pron. , &quot;Susan Lee&quot;; ; born 14 December 1961) is an Australian politician who has been deputy leader of the Liberal Party and Deputy Leader of the Opposition since May 2022. She has been member of parliament (MP) for the New South Wales seat of Farrer since 2001 and was a cabinet minister in the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments.

Ley was born in Nigeria to English parents. She grew up in the UAE and England before moving to Australia as a teenager. Prior to entering politics she worked as a commercial pilot, farmer and public servant based in Albury, New South Wales. Ley was elected to the House of Representatives at the 2001 federal election. She was a parliamentary secretary in the Howard government and became a senior opposition frontbencher following the government&#x27;s defeat in 2007. In the Abbott and Turnbull governments, Ley held the ministerial portfolios of Assistant Minister for Education (2013–2014), Minister for Health (2014–2016), Sport (2014–2017), Aged Care (2015–2016), and Health and Aged Care (2016–2017). She resigned from the ministry in January 2017 following a controversy over her travel expense claims, but returned in August 2018 when Scott Morrison succeeded Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister. She subsequently served as Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories (2018–2019) and Minister for the Environment prior to the government&#x27;s defeat at the 2022 federal election. In the 47th Australian Parliament, Ley represents the Opposition in the roles of Shadow Minister for Women, Industry, Skills and Training, as well as Small and Family Business.

==Early years and background==
Ley was born on 14 December 1961 in Kano, Kano State, Federation of Nigeria. The daughter of English parents, her family moved to the United Arab Emirates when she was one year old, where her father worked as a British intelligence officer. Ley attended boarding school in England until she was 13, when her family migrated to Australia. Her parents bought a hobby farm in Toowoomba, but quickly sold it due to a crash in beef prices. They then moved to Canberra, where her father worked for the Australian Federal Police. She was educated at Campbell High School, Dickson College, La Trobe University, the University of New South Wales and Charles Sturt University, and has master&#x27;s degrees in taxation and accountancy. She changed her name from Susan to Sussan after reading about numerology.

When Ley was 19 she enrolled in flight school and gained her commercial pilot&#x27;s licence when she was 20. She has worked as a waitress and cleaner, and trained as an air traffic controller, but did not complete the course. She did become a commercial pilot, and was later a farmer and shearers&#x27; cook. Ley was Director of Technical Training at the Australian Taxation Office in Albury from 1995 to 2001 before entering politics.

==Politics==
Ley joined the Liberal Party&#x27;s Tallangatta branch in 1994.

===Government (2001–2007)===

Ley was elected to the House of Representatives at the 2001 election, winning the New South Wales seat of Farrer for the Liberal Party following the retirement of former National Party leader and deputy prime minister Tim Fischer. At the time of her election she was living across the border in Old Tallangatta, Victoria, and had recently lost Liberal preselection for the Victorian seat of Indi to Sophie Mirabella. She campaigned in &quot;a large caravan, brightly painted in Liberal blue&quot;, ultimately winning a narrow victory on preferences.

In the Howard government, Ley was appointed Parliamentary Secretary (Children and Youth Affairs) in October 2004 and Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in January 2006.

===Opposition (2007–2013)===

Following the 2007 election, Ley was appointed Shadow Minister for Housing and Shadow Minister for Status of Women by Opposition Leader, Dr Brendan Nelson, moving to Shadow Minister for Customs and Justice when Malcolm Turnbull became Opposition Leader in September 2008.

When Tony Abbott became Opposition Leader in December 2009 she was given the portfolio of Shadow Assistant Treasurer and was moved to Shadow Minister for Employment Participation and Shadow Minister for Childcare and Early Childhood Learning after the 2010 election.

===Abbott and Turnbull governments (2013–2018)===

In September 2013, following the Coalition&#x27;s victory at the 2013 federal election, Ley was appointed Assistant Minister for Education in the Abbott government, with responsibility for childcare. Following a ministerial reshuffle, she was promoted to cabinet in December 2014 as Minister for Health and Minister for Sport. She was also made Minister for Aged Care in September 2015 following the replacement of Tony Abbott with Malcolm Turnbull.

In January 2017, an examination of Ley&#x27;s expenditure claims and travel entitlements revealed she had purchased an apartment on the Gold Coast, close to the business premises of her partner, for $795,000 while on official business in Queensland. Ley defended the purchase, saying her work in the Gold Coast was legitimate, that all travel had been within the rules for entitlements, and that the purchase of the apartment &quot;was not planned nor anticipated&quot; (a claim which was widely derided). On 8 January, Ley released a statement acknowledging that the purchase had changed the context of her travel, and undertaking to repay the government for the cost of the trip in question as well as three others. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Ley had made 27 taxpayer-funded trips to the Gold Coast in recent years.

On 9 January 2017, Ley announced that she would stand aside from her ministerial portfolios until an investigation into her travel expenses was completed by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. She announced that she would not be making her diaries public. On 13 January 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that Ley had resigned from the ministry. Greg Hunt was appointed as Ley&#x27;s replacement as the Minister for Health and Sport, and Ken Wyatt was appointed Assistant Minister for Health and Minister for Indigenous Health and Aged Care, both with effect from 24 January 2017.

===Morrison government (2018–2022)===
During the 2018 Liberal leadership spills, Ley reportedly voted for Peter Dutton against Malcolm Turnbull in the first vote. She subsequently signed the petition requesting to hold a further party meeting to determine the leadership of the Liberal party, and again voted for Dutton against Scott Morrison in the second spill days later, which saw Morrison replace Turnbull as prime minister.

On 26 August 2018, Ley was appointed Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories in the Morrison government. In May 2019, following the party&#x27;s victory at the 2019 election, she replaced Melissa Price as Minister for the Environment.

Since 2020, Ley has been a member of the Global Leaders Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, co-chaired by Sheikh Hasina and Mia Mottley.

In March 2022, Ley successfully appealed a Federal Court ruling that she had a &quot;duty of care to children to consider climate change harm when approving coal mines&quot;.

Also in March 2022, Ley approved a Coalition decision to scrap 176 out of 185 recovery plans designed to prevent the extinction of threatened species and habitats, including the Tasmanian devil. This was despite a government call for feedback, which received 6701 responses, all disagreeing with the proposed removal of the recovery plans.

===Opposition (2022–present)===
Following the Coalition&#x27;s defeat at the 2022 election, it was reported that Ley would be a candidate to replace Josh Frydenberg as deputy leader of the party, following his electoral defeat. Ley was elected unopposed on 30 May 2022.

In July 2022, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek accused former Environment Minister Sussan Ley of hiding a document that was handed to the coalition government in December 2021, ahead of the 2022 Australian federal election. The document outlined the poor and declining health of the Australian ecosystem. &quot;It tells a story of crisis and decline in Australia&#x27;s environment [and] of a decade of government inaction and wilful ignorance,&quot; Ms Plibersek said.

In August 2022, ahead of the Jobs and Skills Summit of Australia, Sussan Ley falsely stated that no one in the world is making an electric ute. &quot;We know we&#x27;re not going to have electric vehicles tomorrow,&quot; Ms Ley said. &quot;And no one in the world is making an electric ute, by the way, and even if they were it would be unaffordable.&quot; . After commentators pointed out that electric utes were already in production, a spokesperson for Ms Ley said that Ms Ley meant that, &quot;EV utes are not yet commercially available in Australia and even if EV utes arrived here overnight, cost-effective models — which invariably have lower distance ranges — are not yet suitable for practical use in rural and regional Australia.&quot;
In March 2023, Ley dressed up as Tina Turner in Parliament to raise money for cancer.

==Political positions==
In 2015 Ley purchased a Gold Coast property at the cost of almost $800,000 while on a taxpayer funded trip from a key liberal donor. During this period Ley had claimed over $650,000 on expenditure. This purchase was described as an unplanned impulse purchase.

In March 2021, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated that Ley was a member of the centre-right faction of the Liberal Party. However, in May 2022 ABC News reported that she was &quot;not aligned with the conservative or moderate factions&quot;. In April 2023, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated that Ley was a member of the moderate faction of the Liberal Party.

In 2011, Ley publicly supported the admission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations and was reported to be a member of the cross-party Parliamentary Friends of Palestine group.

In May 2018, Ley introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to ban the live export of sheep.

In 2023 Ley supported the No vote in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum.

In June 2024, Ley criticised Labor&#x27;s decision not to expel Fatima Payman after Payman support of Palestine, accusing Israel on committing genocide during Israel-Hamas war and using phrase &quot;From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free&quot;

Ley identifies as a feminist.

Ley has voiced support for Elon Musk and, during Australia Day celebrations in 2025, was quoted as comparing the British colonisation of Australia as similar to Musk’s intended colonisation of Mars.

== Personal life ==
Ley met John Ley while aerial stock-mustering in south-west Queensland. They married in 1987, settled on her husband&#x27;s family farm in north-east Victoria, and had three children before their 2004 divorce. Ley has multiple grandchildren, residing on the NSW Central Coast.

Ley lives in Albury, and owns investment properties in both Albury and the Gold Coast.

<doc id="577187" wikidata="Q3521794" url="?curid=577187" title="The Mark of Cain (band)">
<text>The Mark of Cain (also seen as the initialism, TMOC) are an alternative metal band from Adelaide, South Australia. Their style has been likened to that of Helmet and Rollins Band, yet this band pre-dates both groups and was influenced by the early work of Joy Division, Big Black and United States hardcore groups. The Mark of Cain were formed in mid-1984 by brothers, John (guitar) and Kim Scott (bass guitar), with Rod Archer on vocals and Gavin Atkinson playing drums. Before long, Archer had left the group and John Scott took on the lead vocal role and the group has remained a trio ever since. The Scotts have been the core of the band which has featured 10 different drummers. Since January 2001, former Helmet member John Stanier has been their drummer; he is also concurrently with Tomahawk and Battles. The self appointed guru of Australian music, Ian McFarlane, described the group&#x27;s sound as &quot;Gloomy, monotonous vocals and bleak slabs of metallic guitar did battle over a lurching rhythm section to arrive at a harsh sound.&quot; Such erroneous attempts to label the band did not hold true and reflect the consistent efforts of Australia&#x27;s mainstream &#x27;rock&#x27; journalists to put down artists they did not understand. In so far as it is relevant, style wise TMOC were a fusion of Joy Division and Killing Joke, with chorus laced guitar chords played over heavy driving bass and drum rythms in which influence of avant guard bands like Suicide and the&#x27;post punk&#x27; of Big Black and the Jesus Lizard can be heard. As the band matured a rythmic synchronicity that was more a characteristic of metal crossover bands that came later like Fudge Tunnel and Tool. This however distracts from the fact they were (and are) heavy, fast and precise and the definitive bands of the time, like Nirvana were none of those things.

Throughout the 90&#x27;s Australian concert goers saw the emergence of bands that challenged the status quo. Major label influence was challenged by the rise of so-called &quot;Alternative&quot; bands. 
The likes of Big Black, Shellac, Helmet, the Jesus Lizard and Rollins Band were gaining fans in Australia. Many were suprised to learn that among these overseas musicians were fans of an Adelaide band: The Mark of Cain.
Guest programmers on ABC&#x27;s Rage like Henry Rollins, Lydia Lunch and Sepultura played the &#x27;Battlesick&#x27; music video. Rollins praised the band, saying there were bands in the USA that were trying to play &#x27;that kind&#x27; of music, but were years behind TMOC. Rollins would go on to produce &#x27;Ill At Ease&#x27;, the bands most popular album to date.

Rod Archer died on 26 February 2016. 2019 marked the 30th Anniversary of the release of the &quot;Battlesick&quot; album. A major national tour took place in October and the album was re-released on vinyl to celebrate the occasion. Eli Green again tours with the band fulfilling the drumming duties.

In 2020 the band celebrated 25 years since the release of album &#x27;Ill At Ease&#x27; however plans were interrupted by the worldwide COVID-19 infectious disease, delaying tour plans to celebrate this anniversary milestone. 2022 saw &#x27;A Different Kind Of Tension Tour&#x27; announced, kicking off in August with the band playing two shows in their hometown of Adelaide on the back of the band&#x27;s induction into the South Australian Music Association’s Hall of Fame, sitting alongside other legends including No Fixed Address, Cold Chisel, The Angels, Archie Roach and Ruby Hunter and the Masters Apprentices. The band also played dates in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and finishing the tour on the Gold Coast and Brisbane in September.

The Mark Of Cain in 2023 announced for the first time ever they will be performing their 1995 magnum-opus &#x27;Ill At Ease&#x27; live as part of The Eighty-Six Festival at the Croxton Bandroom in Melbourne in October, however due to a severe bike accident with significant injuries to Kim Scott all shows in September and October were cancelled.

TMOC however performed &#x27;Ill At Ease&#x27; live across all states in November 2023 to January 2024 after Kim recovers. The tour coincides with a deluxe remastered vinyl reissue of the 1995 classic for the first time. In addition, a companion piece Livid Live &#x27;96, a set from Brisbane&#x27;s 1996 Livid Festival, was remixed by Phil McKellar and made available on vinyl. Both vinyl albums were released on the 4th of November 2023.

==History==
===1984–1989: Formation and &quot;Battlesick&quot; ===
The Mark of Cain were formed as a punk rock group in Adelaide in mid-1984 by Rod Archer on lead vocals; Gavin Atchison on drums (ex-Spiral Collapse); John Scott on lead guitar (ex-Spiral Collapse) and his younger brother Kim Scott on bass guitar. Their name references the Hermann Hesse&#x27;s novel, &quot;Demian&quot; (1919), which in turn recalls the Genesis story regarding the mark of Cain. John had read &quot;Demian&quot;, which featured &quot; a loner who thought his dark feelings were there for anyone to see as he walked down the street – the Mark of Cain.&quot; Atchison and John&#x27;s earlier group, Spiral Collapse, broke up as John was concentrating on his university course, he also wanted a &quot;new, harder sound&quot; and disliked that band&#x27;s lead singer. John assisted Kim to develop his bass guitar skill and met Archer at one of Spiral Collapse&#x27;s last gigs.

Ian McFarlane, an Australian musicologist, described &quot;the band&#x27;s penchant for militaristic imagery and lyric themes (to say nothing of the members&#x27; close-cropped, marine-styled looks) only added to the sense of desperation and solitude displayed in the band&#x27;s music.&quot; By the end of 1985 Archer had left and John Scott added lead vocals to his guitar work. They replaced Archison with a succession of drummers: David Graham, Roger Crisp, John Rickert, Neil Guive and then Campbell Robinson by late 1988. During 1987 they supported an Adelaide gig by United States group, Big Black, during their Australian tour.

The band&#x27;s first release was a single, &quot;The Lords of Summer&quot;, issued on Sydney label, Phantom Records, in September 1988. It was co-produced by the group with Anthony Bannister and was recorded at Adelaide&#x27;s Soundtrack Australia studios in January of that year. They covered two tracks by former Phantom groups, &quot;Journey by Sledge&quot; (the Visitors) and &quot;Seein&#x27; Double&quot; (Shy Impostors) for a gig give-away album, &quot;Assorted Desecrations and Magnificent Mutations&quot;, in October, by various artists, to celebrate the label&#x27;s tenth anniversary. Phantom&#x27;s owners &quot;had heard something different in the group than what they wanted to deliver, and their progress was periodically interrupted as they kept changing drummers.&quot;

The band signed with local label, Dominator Records, which issued their debut album, &quot;Battlesick&quot; in August 1989. It was co-produced by Stuart Sheldon and the group, which was recorded at Artec Studios, Adelaide in February and March of that year. Patrick Emery of &quot;i-94 Bar&quot; felt &quot;Battlesick&quot; was &quot;dominated by the band&#x27;s Joy Division streak. On &#x27;You Are Alone&#x27; John Scott intones in his best Ian Curtis manner while Kim Scott&#x27;s bass pounds with the relentless precision of artillery session captured on loop.&quot; &quot;Ox Fanzine&quot;″s Joachim Hiller opined that it &quot;combined gloomy early eighties sounds with brachial, bass-heavy Noiserock.&quot;

===1990–1995: &quot;The Unclaimed Prize&quot; and &quot;Ill at Ease&quot;===
Their second album, &quot;The Unclaimed Prize&quot;, was released in March 1991. It was recorded at Artec Sound Vision Productions during January to May 1990. Emery described how it &quot;opens with the pummelling beat of &quot;Fire in Her Heart&quot;, complete with John Scott&#x27;s semi-demented ranting. It&#x27;s a style the band built on – and arguably perfected – on its &quot;Ill at Ease&quot; album released in 1995 ... The lyrics suggest a love song of sorts, yet this is no sappy Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young &#x27;Judy Blue Eyes&#x27; folkie-lust. It&#x27;s as if the warmth and tenderness of the opposite sex merely serves to break down the narrator&#x27;s sense of self and internal emotional structure.&quot;

Emery opined that the group&#x27;s &quot;style has been interpreted as misogynist, arrogant, aloof and even just too bloody loud, but its potency has never been questioned, nor the Scott brothers&#x27; commitment to duty. If ever there was a musical metaphor for human endurance, its TMOC. This music doesn&#x27;t date, especially not in the current security-constructed climate.&quot; McFarlane felt the album &quot;offered up more sonic blasts of rough-hewn guitar riffs and booming drums.&quot; In 1995 the Dominator label issued both albums, &quot;Battlesick&quot; and &quot;The Unclaimed Prize&quot;, as a 2× CD set. The Scott brothers, each took sabbaticals from the band during 1990 (John) and 1991 (Kim) to undertake a &quot;work-related project&quot;, including travelling to Chicago. In mid-1992 the group reconvened.

Steve Albini (of Big Black) produced their next release, a six-track extended play, &quot;Incoming&quot;, released in June 1993. Albini had met the Scott brothers back in 1987 when Mark of Cain had supported his group&#x27;s tour. The EP was the recording debut for Robinson&#x27;s replacement, Aaron Hewson (ex-Order of Decay, Grunter), who had joined on drums, after the release of their second album, &quot;The Unclaimed Prize&quot;. The tracks were recorded at Artec Studios and Soundtrack, Adelaide and Chicago Recording Studios, from 1988 to 1991. Early in 1994 the group performed on the Big Day Out tour and followed, in February, with a non-album single, &quot;Tell Me&quot;, on the Insipid Vinyl label. McFarlane felt &quot;the band&#x27;s influences had broadened to include Sonic Youth, Godflesh and Helmet.&quot; Dominator released their next EP, &quot;The Killer Within&quot;, in July 1995. The group had supported a run of international visiting groups, Rollins Band, Fugazi, Helmet, Albini&#x27;s Shellac, Butthole Surfers, Killdozer, All, Pavement and Primus.

Albini&#x27;s involvement with the Mark of Cain led to Henry Rollins (of Rollins Band) financing and producing the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Ill at Ease&quot; (November 1995). It was recorded at Nesci Studios, Adelaide, in July–August of that year. &quot;Ill at Ease&quot; became the band&#x27;s first released to chart inside the ARIA top 100, peaking at number 73. It gained wide radio support for the group with national youth broadcaster, Triple J, providing their singles, &quot;First Time&quot; and &quot;LMA&quot; with substantial airplay. &quot;Tharunka&quot;″s reviewer, opined that &quot;LMA&quot; is &quot;One of the weaker songs on an album that&#x27;s as heavy and intense as a death in the family. Verging very close to a ballad, &#x27;LMA&#x27; displays all the trademark MOC stop/start syncopation at a much reduced tempo, showing that beneath the hard and tough engineering bloke exteriors they have sentimental sides.&quot; A national tour followed, after which Hewson left and Campbell Robinson returned.

===1996–2007 &quot;This Is This&quot;===
In December 1996 the Mark of Cain released, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, a compilation album of remixes of the group&#x27;s earlier material. McFarlane described the work as comprising &quot;off-kilter remixes&quot; of &quot;band favourites.&quot; The group contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the Australian feature film, &quot;Idiot Box&quot; (1996): &quot;Hindsight&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Degenerate Boy&quot; (originally by early Australian punk band X). The latter track was issued as a single and listed at No. 78 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1997.

Robinson was replaced by Stuart Baguley on drums in late 1998. Baguley was replaced in turn by John Stanier (ex-Helmet, also member of Tomahawk and Battles) in early 2000. He provided the drumming on the Mark of Cain&#x27;s next album, &quot;This Is This&quot;, which was co-produced by Andy Gill of Gang of Four, one of the Mark of Cain&#x27;s early influences, and Phil McKellar (Grinspoon, Regurgitator, The Cruel Sea). It was released by BMG in mid-2001 with the announcement that Stanier was the band&#x27;s permanent drummer.

Australian rock music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, declared it as his Album of the Week for 30 June 2001, explaining &quot;With each album they reach deeper into that well of human darkness, trying to finish what they started... [this] album finds the Scott brothers linking arms with [Stanier]. It&#x27;s an album that nails home its message, song after song, line after line. &#x27;I never wanted this&#x27;. &#x27;One time was too many&#x27;. &#x27;I sleep better when I&#x27;m alone&#x27;. The thoughts of the outsider, which have fascinated literature forever and are at the core of rock and roll. When we lose that, rock and roll will be just entertainment.&quot; Jasper Lee of Oz Music Project opined that &quot;[it] sees a more refined anger that is shown in particular by the drumming prowess of new drummer [Stanier], which adds to the intense vocals of John Scott... the sound on this album is clear and crisp, bringing down the line all the bile and angry bits to be expected of the band with many a reeling, robust audio left hook that blasts the listener through the speakers.&quot; &quot;This is This&quot; peaked at number 26 on the ARIA Charts.

===2008–present: &quot;Songs of the Third and Fifth&quot;===
The Mark of Cain, with Stanier aboard, commenced recording a new album, &quot;Songs of the Third and Fifth&quot; at Broadcast Studios (Adelaide, Australia) in February 2008, with engineer Evan James. Mixing commenced in December 2010 in Melbourne with Forrester Savell. In December 2011 its lead single, &quot;Barkhammer&quot;, was issued and played on Triple J. A second single, &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;, was released in September 2012 and finally the long-awaited album, &quot;Songs of the Third and Fifth&quot;, appeared on 2 December of that year, through Fuse/Feel Presents, earning favourable reviews. &quot;i-94 Bar&quot;″s the Barman described how &quot;TMOC occupies the space where hardcore, punk and metal collide and makes unique with a lyrical heaviness that makes listening to Black Sabbath a Sunday walk in the park.&quot;

In March 2013 the band toured Australia with Eli Green on drums, sitting in for Stanier who was unable to tour due to his commitments with US band, Tomahawk. They completed further tours in 2014 and 2015, with Green on drums. Rod Archer, their original vocalist until 1985, died of cancer on 26 February 2016. In June 2015 the group had performed a benefit concert for Archer who was then undergoing chemotherapy.

In July 2019, the band announced a national tour to play &quot;Battlesick&quot; in its entirety, for its 30th anniversary. A similar tour for 2020 marking the 25th anniversary of &quot;Ill At Ease&quot; was postponed. In 2022, The Mark of Cain was admitted into the South Australian Music Hall of Fame.

The Mark Of Cain in 2023 announced they are a proud addition to the brand new Off The Rails one-day mini-fests in NSW in October and would be joining Amyl &amp; The Sniffers and other bands. The band also announced for the first time ever they will be performing their 1995 magnum-opus &#x27;Ill At Ease&#x27; live as part of The Eighty-Six Festival at the Croxton Bandroom in Melbourne in October, however due to a severe bike accident with significant injuries to Kim Scott all shows in September and October were cancelled.

TMOC however performed &#x27;Ill At Ease&#x27; live across all states from November 2023 after Kim recovered from his injuries. Eli Green yet again tours with the band marking 10 years since joining the band for tour duties. The tour coincides with a deluxe remastered vinyl reissue of the 1995 classic for the first time. In addition, a companion piece Livid Live &#x27;96, the complete thirty-minute set from Brisbane&#x27;s 1996 Livid Festival, was remixed by Phil McKellar and made available as a stand-alone album on vinyl. Both vinyl albums were released on the 4th of November 2023 as a limited release.

In 2024 the band continues playing the remaining shows of the &#x27;Ill At Ease&#x27; live tour in January and headline the &#x27;Nice Day To Go To The Club&#x27; festival in South Australia on 24 February.

<text>Compsognathus (; Greek &quot;kompsos&quot;/κομψός; &quot;elegant&quot;, &quot;refined&quot; or &quot;dainty&quot;, and &quot;gnathos&quot;/γνάθος; &quot;jaw&quot;) is a genus of small, bipedal, carnivorous theropod dinosaur. Members of its single species Compsognathus longipes could grow to around the size of a chicken. They lived about 150 million years ago, during the Tithonian age of the late Jurassic period, in what is now Europe. Paleontologists have found two well-preserved fossils, one in Germany in the 1850s and the second in France more than a century later. Today, &quot;C. longipes&quot; is the only recognized species, although the larger specimen discovered in France in the 1970s was once thought to belong to a separate species and named &quot;C. corallestris&quot;.

Many presentations still describe &quot;Compsognathus&quot; as &quot;chicken-sized&quot; dinosaurs because of the size of the German specimen, which is now believed to be a juvenile. &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot; is one of the few dinosaur species whose diet is known with certainty: the remains of small, agile lizards are preserved in the bellies of both specimens. Teeth discovered in Portugal may be further fossil remains of the genus.

Although not recognized as such at the time of its discovery, &quot;Compsognathus&quot; is the first theropod dinosaur known from a reasonably complete fossil skeleton. Until the 1990s, it was the smallest-known non-avialan dinosaur, with the preceding centuries incorrectly labelling them as the closest relative of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;.

==Discovery and species==

&quot;Compsognathus&quot; is known from two almost complete skeletons. The German specimen (specimen number BSP AS I 563) stems from limestone deposits in Bavaria and was part of the collection of the physician and fossil collector Joseph Oberndorfer. Oberndorfer lent the specimen to paleontologist Johann A. Wagner, who published a brief discussion in 1859, where he coined the name &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot;. Wagner did not recognise &quot;Compsognathus&quot; as a dinosaur, but instead described it as one of the &quot;most curious forms among the lizards&quot;. He published a more detailed description in 1861. In 1866, Oberndorfer&#x27;s collection, including the &quot;Compsognathus&quot; specimen, was acquired by the paleontological state collection in Munich.

Both the year of discovery and the exact locality of the German specimen are unknown, possibly because Oberndorfer did not reveal details of the discovery to prevent other collectors from exploiting the locality; later authors have suggested that the German specimen was probably discovered during the 1850s. Weathering of the slab on which the fossil is preserved indicates that it was collected from a pile of waste rock left behind by quarrying. The specimen either stems from Jachenhausen or the region Riedenburg–Kehlheim. All possible localities are part of lagoonal deposits of the Painten Formation, and date to the latest part of the late Kimmeridgian or the earlier part of the early Tithonian. In the Jurassic, the region was part of the Solnhofen archipelago. The limestone of the area, the Solnhofen limestone, had been quarried for centuries, and yielded such well-preserved fossils as &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; with feather impressions and pterosaurs with imprints of their wing membranes.

In two publications in 1868 and 1870, Thomas Huxley, a major proponent of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, compared &quot;Compsognathus&quot; with &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, which was considered the earliest known bird. Following earlier suggestions by Carl Gegenbaur and Edward Drinker Cope, Huxley found that &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; was closely similar to &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, and referred to the latter as a &quot;bird-like reptile&quot;. He concluded that birds must have evolved from dinosaurs, an assessment that established &quot;Compsognathus&quot; as one of the most widely known dinosaurs. The specimen has since been studied by many prominent paleontologists, including Othniel Charles Marsh, who visited Munich in 1881. The German paleontologist J.G. Baur, who worked as an assistant of Marsh, removed the right ankle from the slab for illustration and study; this removed part got lost since. Although Baur published a detailed study of the ankle in 1882, which is now the only available source of information of this part of the skeleton, his reconstruction was later found to be inconsistent with corresponding impressions on the slab. John Ostrom thoroughly described the German specimen as well as the newly discovered French specimen in 1978, making &quot;Compsognathus&quot; one of the best-known small theropods at that time. He also concluded that the German specimen likely belongs to an immature individual.
The larger French specimen (Y85R M4M) was discovered in around 1971 in the Portlandian lithographic limestone of Canjuers near Nice. It dates to the lower Tithonian, as indicated by ammonite index fossils. As Solnhofen, Canjures was famous for its limestone plates, which were quarried and sold under the name &quot;dalles de Provence&quot;. The specimen was originally part of a large private fossil collection of Louis Ghirardi, the owner of the Canjures quarries. The collection, including the &quot;Compsognathus&quot; specimen, was sold to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris in 1983. Alain Bidar and Gérard Thomel, in a brief 1972 description, announced the new find under a separate species, &quot;Compsognathus corallestris&quot;. A more comprehensive description followed in the same year. According to these authors, the new species differed from the German species in its larger size and modified, flipper-like hand. Ostrom, Jean-Guy Michard and others have since relabeled it as another example of &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot;. In 1984, George Callison and Helen Quimby identified the smaller German specimen as a juvenile of the same species.

Collector Heinrich Fischer had originally labeled a partial foot consisting of three metatarsals and a phalanx, from the Solnhofen area, as belonging to &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot;. This identification was rejected by Wilhelm Dames, when he described the specimen for the first time in 1884. Friedrich von Huene, in 1925 and 1932, also found that the foot did probably not belong to &quot;Compsognathus&quot; itself but to a closely related genus. Ostrom, in his 1978 monography, questioned the attribution of this fossil to &quot;Compsognathus&quot; once more. Jens Zinke, in 1998, assigned forty-nine isolated teeth from the Guimarota coal mine of Portugal to the genus. Zinke found that these teeth are not identical to those of &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot;, having serrations on the front edge, and thus labeled the teeth as &quot;Compsognathus&quot; sp. (of unknown species).

==Description==

For decades, &quot;Compsognathus&quot; was known as the smallest known non-avian dinosaur, although some dinosaurs discovered later, such as &quot;Mahakala&quot; and &quot;Microraptor&quot;, were even smaller. The German specimen was estimated to be and in length by separate authors, while the larger French specimen was estimated at and in length. The height at the hip has been estimated at for the German specimen and at for the French specimen. The German specimen was estimated to have weighed and , and the French specimen and . Compared to other compsognathids, the larger French specimen would have been similar in size to larger &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; specimens, but smaller than &quot;Huaxiagnathus&quot; and &quot;Mirischia&quot;.

&quot;Compsognathus&quot; were small, bipedal animals with long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were smaller than the hindlimbs. The hand bore two large, clawed digits and a third, smaller digit that may have been non-functional. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket), with the eyes being larger in proportion to the rest of the skull. The lower jaw was slender and had no mandibular fenestra, a hole in the side of the lower jawbone commonly seen in archosaurs.

The teeth were small and pointed, suited for its diet of small vertebrates and possibly other small animals, such as insects. The German specimen had three teeth in each premaxilla (front bone of the lower jaw), 15 or 16 teeth in each maxilla, and 18 teeth in the lower jaw. The French specimen had more teeth, including four in each premaxilla, 17 or 18 in the maxilla, and at least 21 teeth in the dentary. Compsognathids were unique among theropods in having tooth crowns that curved backwards at two thirds of their height, while their mid-parts were straight; also, the crowns had expanded bases. In &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, the frontmost teeth of the upper and lower jaws were unserrated, while those further back had fine serrations on their rear edges. In the German specimen, the crowns were around two times higher than wide in the front of the jaws but diminished in height further back, with the last tooth about as high as wide. The German specimen also shows a diastema (tooth gap) behind the first three teeth of the premaxilla. As such a gap was not present in the French specimen, Peyer suggested that additional teeth were possibly present in this region the German specimen.

The number of digits on the hand of &quot;Compsognathus&quot; has been a source of debate. For much of its history, &quot;Compsognathus&quot; was typically depicted with three digits, as is typical for theropods. However, the type specimen only preserved phalanges from the first two digits, leading to the suggestion that &quot;Compsognathus&quot; bore only two functional digits, with the third metacarpal being extremely slender and reduced. Study of the French specimen indicated that the third digit bore at least one or two small phalanges. However, there remains no evidence for an ungual phalanx on the third digit, so the digit may have been reduced and non-functional.

===Integument===

Some relatives of &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, namely &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; and &quot;Sinocalliopteryx&quot;, have been preserved with the remains of simple feathers covering the body like fur, prompting some scientists to suggest that &quot;Compsognathus&quot; might have been feathered in a similar way. Consequently, many depictions of &quot;Compsognathus&quot; show them with coverings of downy proto-feathers. However, no feathers or feather-like covering have been preserved with &quot;Compsognathus&quot; fossils, in contrast to &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, which are found in the same sediments. Karin Peyer, in 2006, reported skin impressions preserved on the side of the tail starting at the 13th tail vertebra. The impressions showed small bumpy tubercles, similar to the scales found on the tail and hind legs of &quot;Juravenator&quot;. Additional scales had in 1901 been reported by Von Huene, in the abdominal region of the German &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, but Ostrom subsequently disproved this interpretation; in 2012 they were by Achim Reisdorf seen as plaques of adipocere, corpse wax.

Like &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, and unlike &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, a patch of fossilized skin from the tail and hindlimb of the possible relative &quot;Juravenator starki&quot; shows mainly scales, though there is some indication that simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs, or maybe that some species had fewer feathers than others.

==Classification==
Originally classified as a lizard, the dinosaurian affinities of &quot;Compsognathus&quot; were first noted by Gegenbaur, Cope, and Huxley between 1863 and 1868. Cope, in 1870, classified &quot;Compsognathus&quot; within a new clade of dinosaurs, the Symphypoda, which also contained &quot;Ornithotarsus&quot; (today classified as &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;). Later, both genera were found to belong to other groups of Cope&#x27;s classification of dinosaurs: &quot;Compsognathus&quot; to the Gonipoda (equivalent to Theropoda, in which it is now classified), and &quot;Ornithotarsus&quot; to the Orthopoda (equivalent to Ornithischia). Huxley, in 1870, rejected Cope&#x27;s dinosaur classification scheme, and instead proposed the new clade Ornithoscelida, in which he included the Dinosauria (comprising several forms now considered as ornithischians) and another new clade, the Compsognatha, which contained &quot;Compsognathus&quot; as the only member. Later, these groups fell into disuse, although a resurrection of the Ornithoscelida was proposed in 2017. The group Compsognatha was used for the last time by Marsh in a 1896 publication, where it was treated as a suborder of Theropoda. In the same publication, Marsh erected the new family Compsognathidae. Friedrich von Huene, in 1914, erected the new infraorder Coelurosauria, which includes the Compsognathidae amongst other families of small theropods; this classification remained in use since.

The Compsognathidae are a group of mostly small dinosaurs from the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods of China, Europe and South America. For many years, &quot;Compsognathus&quot; was the only member known, but in recent decades paleontologists have discovered several related genera. The clade includes &quot;Aristosuchus&quot;, &quot;Huaxiagnathus&quot;, &quot;Mirischia&quot;, &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, and perhaps &quot;Juravenator&quot; and &quot;Scipionyx&quot;. At one time, &quot;Mononykus&quot; was proposed as a member of the family, but this was rejected by Chen and coauthors in a 1998 paper; they considered the similarities between &quot;Mononykus&quot; and the compsognathids to be an example of convergent evolution. The position of &quot;Compsognathus&quot; and its relatives within the coelurosaur group is uncertain. Some, such as theropod expert Thomas Holtz Jr. and co-authors Ralph Molnar and Phil Currie in the landmark 2004 text &quot;Dinosauria&quot;, hold the family as the most basal of the coelurosaurs, while others as part of the Maniraptora.

For almost a century, &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot; was the only well-known small theropod species. This led to comparisons with &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and to suggestions of an especially close relationship with birds. In fact, &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, rather than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, piqued Huxley&#x27;s interest in the origin of birds. The two animals share similarities in shape and proportions, so many in fact that two specimens of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, the &quot;Eichstätt&quot; and the &quot;Solnhofen&quot;, were for a time misidentified as those of &quot;Compsognathus&quot;. Many other types of theropod dinosaurs, such as maniraptorans, are now known to have been more closely related to birds.

Below is a simplified cladogram placing &quot;Compsognathus&quot; in Compsognathidae by Senter &quot;et al.&quot; in 2012.

Here is an alternative phylogeny, published by &quot;Cau&quot; in 2024, with both specimens in bold.
==Paleobiology==
In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, nine foot bones referred to &quot;Compsognathus&quot; were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.

===Habitat===
Bidar and colleagues, in their 1972 description of the French specimen, argued that this specimen had webbed hands which would look like flippers in life. This interpretation was based on a supposed impression of the flipper that consists of several undulating wrinkles running parallel to the forelimb on the surface of the slab. In a 1975 popular book, L. Beverly Halstead depicts the animal as an amphibious dinosaur capable of feeding on aquatic prey and swimming out of reach of larger predators. Ostrom debunked this hypothesis, noting that the forelimb of the French specimen is poorly preserved, and that the wrinkles extend well beyond the skeleton and thus are likely sedimentary structures unrelated to the fossil.

===Diet===

The remains of a lizard in the German specimen&#x27;s thoracic cavity show that &quot;Compsognathus&quot; preyed on small vertebrates. Marsh, who examined the specimen in 1881, thought that this small skeleton in the &quot;Compsognathus&quot; belly was an embryo, but in 1903, Franz Nopcsa concluded that it was a lizard. Ostrom identified the remains as belonging to a lizard of the genus &quot;Bavarisaurus&quot;, which he concluded was a fast and agile runner owing to its long tail and limb proportions. This in turn led to the conclusion that its predators, &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, must have had sharp vision and the ability to rapidly accelerate and outrun the lizard. Conrad made the lizard found in the thoracic cavity of the German specimen of &quot;Compsognathus&quot; the holotype of a new species &quot;Schoenesmahl dyspepsia&quot;. The lizard is in several pieces, indicating that the &quot;Compsognathus&quot; must have dismembered it while restraining it with its hands and teeth, and then swallowed the remains whole; a similar strategy is used by modern predatory birds. The French specimen&#x27;s gastric contents consist of unidentified lizards or sphenodontids.

===Possible eggs===
The plate of the German &quot;Compsognathus&quot; shows several circular irregularities in diameter near the skeletal remains. Peter Griffiths interpreted them as immature eggs in 1993. However, later researchers have doubted their connection to the genus because they were found outside the body cavity of the animal. A well-preserved fossil of a &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, a genus related to &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, shows two oviducts bearing two unlaid eggs. These proportionally larger and less numerous eggs of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; cast further doubt on the original identification of the purported &quot;Compsognathus&quot; eggs. In 1964 German geologist Karl Werner Barthel had explained the discs as gas bubbles formed in the sediment because of the putrefaction of the carcass.

===Speed===
In 2007, William Sellers and Phillip Manning estimated a maximum speed of based on a computer model of the skeleton and muscles. This estimate has been criticized by other scholars.

==Paleoenvironment==

During the late Jurassic, Europe was a dry, tropical archipelago at the edge of the Tethys Sea. The fine limestone in which the skeletons of &quot;Compsognathus&quot; have been found originated in calcite from the shells of marine organisms. Both the German and French areas where &quot;Compsognathus&quot; specimens have been preserved were lagoons situated between the beaches and coral reefs of the Jurassic European islands in the Tethys Sea. Contemporaries of &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot; include the early avialan &quot;Archaeopteryx lithographica&quot; and the pterosaurs &quot;Rhamphorhynchus muensteri&quot; and &quot;Pterodactylus antiquus&quot;. The same sediments in which &quot;Compsognathus&quot; have been preserved also contain fossils of a number of marine animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the coastal habitat of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, indicating that these little dinosaurs might in fact have been the top land predator in these islands.

===Taphonomy===
Much discussion revolved around the taphonomy of the German specimen, i.e. how the individual died and became fossilized. Reisdorf and Wuttke, in 2012, speculated about the events that lead to the death and transportation of the specimen to its place of burial. First, the individual must have been brought into the lagoon from its habitat, which probably was on the surrounding islands. It is possible that a flash flood swept the animal into the sea, in which case it likely died by drowning. It is also possible that the animal swam or drifted onto the sea, or that it rafted on plants, and was then transported by surface currents to its place of burial. In any case, the specimen would have arrived on the sea floor within a few hours after its death, as otherwise gases forming in its body cavity would have prevented it from sinking in one piece. Water depth at the burial site would have been large enough to prevent refloating of the carcass after such gases were produced. Rounded structures on the slab might have been formed by the release of these gases.

Taphonomic reconstructions are complicated as the exact locality and the position and orientation of the fossil within the sediments is no longer known. As a compression fossil, the specimen would originally have been preserved on both the upper surface of a layer and the lower surface of the subsequent layer (i.e., on a slab and its counter-slab); the counter-slab is now lost. Reisdorf and Wuttke, in 2012, argued that the front and hind limbs of the left side of the body were better (still connected together) than those of the right side. This suggests that the specimen is located on the bottom side of the upper slab, and was lying on its left side. The German specimen was preserved with a high degree of articulation – only the skull, hands, cervical ribs and gastralia show disarticulation. The braincase was displaced behind the skull, the first tail vertebra was rotated by 90°, and the tail shows a break between the seventh and eighth tail vertebra.
In both &quot;Compsognathus&quot; specimens, the neck is strongly curved, with the head coming to rest above the pelvis; the spine of the tail was likewise curved. This posture, known as the death pose, is found in many vertebrate fossils, and the German &quot;Compsognathus&quot; specimen was central in several studies that sought to explain this phenomenon. The physician Moodie, in 1918, suggested that the death pose in &quot;Compsognathus&quot; and similar fossils was the result of an opisthotonus – death throes causing spastic stiffening of the back musculature – while the animal was dying. This hypothesis was soon challenged by paleontologist Friedrich von Huene, who argued that the death pose was the result of desiccation and therefore occurred only after the death. Peter Wellnhofer, in 1991, argued that death poses resulted from the elastic pull of the ligaments, which are released after death. The veterinarian Cynthia Faux and the paleontologist Kevin Padian, in a 2007 study that gained much attention, supported the original opisthotonus hypothesis of Moodie. These authors furthermore argued that upon death, muscles are relaxed and body parts can be easily moved relative to each other. Since opisthotonic postures are already established during death, they may only be preserved if the animal dies in place and becomes buried rapidly. This contradicts previous interpretations on the environment and taphonomy of &quot;Compsognathus&quot; and other fossils from the Solnhofen limestones, which assumed very slow burial at the bottom of lagoons into which the carcasses were transported from nearby islands. Reisdorf and Wuttke concluded that the death posture indeed resulted from the release of ligaments, more specifically the , which spans the spine from the neck to tail in modern birds. The release of this ligament would have occurred gradually while the surrounding muscle tissue decayed, and only after the carcass was transported to its final site of deposition.

The bottom water of the lagoon was likely anaerobic (devoid in oxygen), resulting in a sea floor devoid of life except for microbial mats, and therefore preventing scavenging of the carcass. In the trunk region of the German specimen, the surface of the slab is markedly different in texture to the surrounding areas of the slab, showing irregular, nodular surfaces within depressions. Ostrom, in 1978, interpreted these structures as traces of weathering that took place just before the fossil was collected. Nopcsa, in 1903, instead suggested that these structures resulted from decomposing tissue of the carcass. Reisdorf and Wuttke, in their 2012 study, suggested that the structures are the remains of adipocere (corpse wax formed by bacteria) that formed around the carcass before burial. Such adipocere would have helped in conserving the state of articulation of the fossil for years when burial was very slow. The presence of adipocere would possibly rule out hypersalinity (very high salt contents) of the bottom water, because such conditions appear to be unfavorable for the adipocere producing bacteria.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Compsognathus&quot; is one of the more popular dinosaurs. For a long time it was considered unique in its small size, which is commonly compared to that of a chicken. These animals have appeared in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise: in the films &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, &quot;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Jurassic World Dominion&quot; and in the series &quot;Camp Cretaceous&quot;, where they were often nicknamed &quot;Compies&quot;. In &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, one of the characters incorrectly identifies the species as &quot;Compsognathus triassicus&quot;, combining the genus name of &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot; with the specific name of &quot;Procompsognathus triassicus&quot;, a distantly related small carnivore featured in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; novels.

<text>2UE is an all-music radio station in Sydney owned by Nine Entertainment and run under a lease agreement by Ace Radio. It currently broadcasts from its studios in Pyrmont, New South Wales.

==History==
===1920s===
====2EU====
Electrical Utilities applied to the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department for a licence for a new B Class (later commercial) station licence. The station was to have the call-sign 2EU, based on the initials of Electrical Utilities. However, before the licence, &quot;PMG – Broadcasting Station Licence&quot; No.12, was issued on 7 November 1924, Electrical Utilities advised the PMG that it wished to reverse the initials in the call-sign – thus the licence was issued to 2UE. As to the reason for the change of call-sign, Jim Malone, Chief Manager of Telegraphs and Wireless for the Federal Government, suggested the change saying that 2UE had a &quot;more euphonious sound&quot;.

====2UE====
2UE opened on 26 January 1925. The founder of Electrical Utilities and 2EU/2UE was Cecil &quot;Pa&quot; Stevenson, who was also 2UE&#x27;s chief engineer, and one of the most prominent personalities in Australia&#x27;s early broadcasting history. Prior to opening 2UE, he had operated experimental station 2IY, as well as working alongside a couple of other early experimenters.

Pa Stevenson was assisted at 2UE by his family, and in particular by his eldest son, Murray. Murray Stevenson claimed that he was chiefly responsible for the technical side of the station. Pa Stevenson was the first announcer.

The original studio was in the dining room of the Stevenson Maroubra home; and an 80 feet (24.384 metres) transmitting tower was installed in his back yard. All the equipment was homemade; the studio and equipment costing £750 ($1,500) to build, and £9 ($18) per week to operate. Within a short time the studios were moved to Stevenson&#x27;s radio store in George Street, Sydney.

Most programming was provided by 78 rpm recordings or player piano rolls. It is reputed that whilst changing records or rolls, Stevenson would whistle so as to prevent dead air. 2UE was originally on the air daily from 8.00 pm to 10.00 pm. The station is reputed to have broadcast Australia&#x27;s first radio advertisement. A local butcher was so disconcerted with the sounds between recordings and piano rolls that he paid Stevenson one shilling (10¢) to substitute his whistling with short talks about the quality of the butcher&#x27;s meat. One shilling then became the station&#x27;s standard advertising rate. Another early advertiser was &quot;Youth-O-Form&quot; slimming tablets. A spokesperson for the manufacturer claimed: &quot;each morning after we aired the spots there would be long queues outside the shop at Roseberry.

There are records of early 2UE broadcasts being picked up in the US and New Zealand.

2UE is the oldest current commercial radio station in Australia.

In 1929, through Cecil Stevenson, 2UE experimented with sending pictures by radio using radiovision or mechanical television. The experiments were short-lived due to the lack of receivers to pick up
the transmissions. (Melbourne stations 3UZ and 3DB also both conducted similar experimental transmissions in 1929.)

===1930s===
====Broadcast Services Association====
As a cost saving measure in the depths of the Great Depression, in December 1935 it was announced that an organisation to be known as Broadcasting Service Association, Limited, would co-ordinate and provide combined production resources for 2UE and 2GB, but without owning or operating either station. On 7 January 1937, it was announced that the two stations would operate as the &quot;Red Network&quot; and the &quot;Blue Network&quot;; a concept which was copied from the US&#x27;s NBC network, which operated a Red Network and Blue Network at this time. However, the concept never transpired in Australia, because in February 2GB announced that it was going to form its own national network, and that eventually led to the formation of the Macquarie Network in 1938 which was at first jointly managed by 2GB and 2UE.

====Major Broadcasting Network====
In 1938 2UE and 3DB Melbourne launched the Major Broadcasting Network which for many decades was Australia&#x27;s second most important radio network, after the Macquarie Network. The main person behind the formation of the Major Network was David Worrall, manager of 3DB, and a most important figure in broadcasting history.

The Major Network&#x27;s Sydney outlet later changed from 2UE to 2CH and then to 2UW before 2UE yet again became the Major Network outlet in Sydney in September 1950.
The Network broadcast a wide range of live variety programs including quizzes and dramas including soap operas, mostly emanating from the 3DB or 2UE studios.

The formation of the Major Network actually happened after two earlier attempts by David Worrall to form a network with 2UE as the Sydney station. In 1933, a loose grouping, but the first Australian attempt to form a commercial network, was attempted, known as the Federal Network. Then, in 1933 the Associated Broadcasters of Australia was formed but, again, did not last long.

====Accommodation====
In 1938 2UE and 2GB, as partners in the newly formed Broadcast Services Association moved their studios and offices to Savoy House, 29 Bligh Street, Sydney, with 2UE on the 4th and 5th floors and 2GB on the 6th and 7th floors.

In 1930 a new transmitter was installed at Lilli Pilli.

====Ownership====
In 1933–34 Pa Stevenson sold the station to Associated Newspapers Ltd, publishers of The Sun. However, the Stevenson family, particularly Murray Stevenson, continued to have an influence at the station.

====Time signal====
In 1938 the station was commencing its broadcasts at 6.00 am with &quot;The Alarm Clock&quot;.

From 1939, 2UE became the first Australian station to broadcast six pips from the Australian observatory as an hourly time signal. For many decades all Australian stations carried the six pip time signal first heard on 2UE, and many stations continued to provide this service until the service was switched off in October 2019.

====Drama====
The 2UE Dramatic Players were established in the 1930s providing a number of dramas and serials on a repertory basis. The Players were led by George Edwards, arguably the most prominent radio actor and producer of the time. Some time later, Paul Jacklin was appointed 2UE&#x27;s head of production. Malcolm &quot;Max&quot; Afford also played an important role in 2UE&#x27;s dramatic productions in the 1930s and into the 1940s. Right up to the early 1960s 2UE was to produce many dozens of audio plays for the Major Broadcasting Network. These mainly consisted of 15-minute serials or soap operas and 30-minute dramas. However, probably the most important dramatic production to emanate from the 2UE studios was the Australian version of the &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; which was heard at 8.00 pm every Sunday evening until 1952 – in pre-television days, arguably the most listened-to hour in the week for any radio station. (For much of its time on air, the Lux Radio Theatre was in competition with 2GB&#x27;s &quot;Macquarie Radio Theatre&quot; later known as the &quot;Caltex Theatre&quot;.)

====Live music====
2UE transmitted many live musical broadcasts during this era. These ranged from classical to pop. The importance of these types of programming at that time, is highlighted by the fact that in 1933 the 2UE Academy of Music was formed under Rex Shaw and Professor Clarence Elkin, so as to train singers and instrumentalists, particularly in the classical field. However, the Academy only lasted about a year.

====Cricket / Don Bradman====
In the 1930s, Test Cricket had a particularly high profile and most capital city radio stations, both the ABC and commercial stations, used the cricket as a vehicle for competitive programming, often interspersing live variety programs with news of the ongoing match supplied by overseas cablegrams. In 1931 a Sydney menswear store arranged for Don Bradman to broadcast twice weekly during the cricket season. He was on a two-year contract at the very high sum of £1,000 a year; a deal which is credited with keeping Bradman in Australia.

Bradman also regularly played the piano during 2UE&#x27;s weekly &quot;Call to Youth&quot; program.

====World War II====
On 3 September 1939 2UE was broadcasting a radio drama in the Lux Radio Theatre series when the performance of Leah Kleschna was interrupted by the voice of the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies announcing that Australia was now at war with Germany.

Censorship was rife during the war, particularly after the U.S. entered the conflict on 7 December 1941. After General Douglas MacArthur set up his headquarters in Australia, he wielded enormous power, including on matters of censorship. Inter-alia, he declared that every Australian radio station would only broadcast three news bulletins per day and that these would be simultaneous at 7.45 am, midday and 7.00 pm. Weather forecasts were banned because it was felt that this may assist the enemy.

Notices were issued banning radio stations from broadcasting some major wartime events, but as the federal government did not have the same power over the printed press as it did over radio, newspapers usually reported events that radio was not permitted to mention.

There was some talk of closing down all commercial radio stations, as the enemy could beam-in on the transmitters and use these as bombing targets. As it transpired, this did not happen. However, some stations (not 2UE) were closed down for 24 hours as &quot;punishment&quot; for perceivably ignoring bans on radio reporting particular news items.

Many sponsors donated their advertising time to patriotic appeals.

2UE was also badly affected by staff enlisting. 2UE personality Frank Bennett became a broadcaster at 9AP Labuan, Borneo. Arthur Pettet, an engineer at 2UE, became the Chief Engineer at 9AD, Morotai, Dutch East Indies. Bennett and Pettet were only two of dozens of radio personnel who took up positions at the 20 Australian military radio stations throughout the Pacific.

The supply of overseas programs was virtually cut off during the war, particularly from the U.S., meaning that Australian stations had to produce more local programs; this was the case at 2UE.

===1940s===
====Accommodation====
In July 1941 Prime Minister Robert Menzies officially opened a new 1,000 watt transmitter at Concord. The transmitter tower was wired with explosives by the army, so that an enemy could not have used it, should there have been a World War II invasion.
Fire destroyed the Savoy House studios in 1943, and another Sydney station, 2CH, gave 2UE temporary accommodation in their own studio complex.

====Horse racing====
2UE was well known over many decades for its coverage of races, both in Sydney and, through relays, of meetings throughout Australia. It also relayed Sydney races both through Major Broadcasting Network affiliates and through other stations. The 2UE racing service commenced in 1945 when Sports Editor Clif Cary, already well known for his cricket broadcasts, started a service then known as the Associated Sports Broadcasts which relayed horse racing and other Saturday afternoon sporting events to nine other N.S.W. stations. The racing service ended in 1983 when Des Hoysted called the last race to be broadcast by 2UE. The long list of 2UE race-callers included Clif Cary, Ken Howard, Des Hoysted, Andrew Martin and Harry Solomons.

===1950s===
====Promotional slogan====
During this era, 2UE was known as The Modern Station.

====Sale====
In 1954 John Lamb purchased 2UE from Associated Newspapers, for £165,000 ($330,000). Lamb also owned 2KO Newcastle, New South Wales. John Lamb died in 1978, and his son, Stewart, moved from Newcastle to Sydney to look after the Lamb family&#x27;s interests in 2UE.

====Gary O&#x27;Callaghan====
Gary O&#x27;Callaghan was Sydney&#x27;s number one breakfast announcer for 28 years, winning 159 surveys.

====Top 40====
2UE instigated Australia&#x27;s first Top 40 on 2 March 1958, with former Newcastle announcer Pat Barton as the host of a daily Top 40 program. The number one song on the very first Top 40 chart was Pat Boone&#x27;s April Love.

===1960s===
====New promotional slogan====
During the 1960s, the station was known as The Brighter 2UE.

====Sydney&#x27;s Pop Music station====
In the early 1960s, 2UE dropped virtually all of its variety and drama shows. It was considered that television had become the home for these types of programming. 2UE increased its reliance on a Top 40 format, becoming one of the first stations in Australia to devote most of its air time to pop music, but by the end of this decade 2SM had superseded 2UE as Sydney&#x27;s most popular Top 40 station.

Popular 2UE DJs in this era included Bob Rogers, Tony Withers and John Laws.

Commencing in 1966, a major pop music promotion on 2UE Sydney and 3UZ Melbourne was Hoadley&#x27;s Battle of the Sounds, a national rock band concert staged to promote Australian talent and foster new bands. However, after a few years, 2SM was appointed the Sydney outlet for the Battle of the Sounds, replacing 2UE.

One popular variety program that did survive for many years was the &quot;National Old Time Dance&quot; with Jack Papworth&#x27;s orchestra, every Friday evening. It was relayed to stations across Australia. At one stage it was broadcast from The Albert Palais, Leichhardt.

====Talkback====
Until 1967 talkback was illegal in Australia because of government concerns that: a) people may say something they shouldn&#x27;t; and b) callers may not know they were on the air. Nevertheless, many stations, particularly 2UW in Sydney and 3AK Melbourne, did broadcast talkback from 1963. However, 2UE and 3DB (Melbourne) were the first Australian stations to legally present talkback, commencing on 17 April 1967. Journalist Ormsby Wilkins was the first 2UE talkback host.

===1970s===
====Country music====
Although 2UE was mainly broadcasting Top 40 during this period, in the early 1970s it also featured some country music, including programs hosted by Studio Manager Nick Erby. John Laws also included a deal of country music in his programs.

===1980s===
====Ownership changes====
The Lamb family sold 2UE to Kerry Packer in the 1980s, and Packer then sold it to Alan Bond but when the Bond Empire was crumbling in the early 1990s, the Lamb family was to buy back 2UE.

==== CBC Network ====
In 1986, under Kerry Packer, 2UE and 3AK Melbourne, embarked on a shared talk-back format called the CBC Network which featured selected Melbourne and Sydney based programs being broadcast across both stations. Two separate breakfast programs were broadcast for both Sydney and Melbourne but that was the only shift with separate programming. All other programs, whether emanating from Sydney or Melbourne, were heard over both stations. Well-known Sydney and Melbourne news broadcaster and radio management expert Brian White managed both stations. However, the CBC experiment was a short-lived failure.

==== Phillip Adams ====
In the late 1980s, Phillip Adams broadcast a commentary program, ranging from serious news analysis to tongue-in-cheek content. After leaving 2UE in the early 1990s, Adams began a similar program on ABC Radio National and Radio Australia. The ABC program is still being broadcast in 2022, after a life of about 30 years.

====Huge prize====
In 1984, 2UE ran a competition, &quot;Millionaire Mania&quot;, in which a prize of $20,000 a year for 50 years, was offered. This was believed to be the largest-ever radio prize to that date. 2UE management was no doubt relieved when Premier Neville Wran drew out the name of someone described as an &quot;older lady&quot;.

===1990s===
====Cash for comment====

2UE was the centre of the cash for comment affair, an Australian scandal that broke in 1999. It concerned paid advertising on talk back radio that was presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. The affair was first reported on the ABC program &quot;Media Watch&quot; by reporters Richard Ackland, Deborah Richards and Ann Connelly. They revealed that 2UE hosts John Laws and Alan Jones had been paid to give favourable comment to companies including Qantas, Optus, Foxtel, Mirvac and major Australian banks, without disclosing this arrangement to listeners. The Australian Broadcasting Authority found that John Laws, Alan Jones, and 2UE had committed 90 breaches of the industry code and five breaches of 2UE&#x27;s license conditions. 2UE was fined $360,000 for John Laws&#x27;s improper conduct.

===2000–2016===
====News talk====
2UE continued to broadcast a news talk format, involving current affairs oriented programs with talkback across the day and more relaxed programming at nights and on weekends. News updates were broadcast at the top of every hour, provided by Macquarie Radio Network.

====More ownership changes====
In March 2001, the Lamb family sold 2UE and 4BC to Southern Cross Broadcasting for a reputed $90 million.

In July 2007, Fairfax Media purchased all of Southern Cross Broadcasting&#x27;s metro radio assets, including 2UE, 3AW and 4BC.

On 22 December 2014, it was announced that Fairfax&#x27;s radio division and Macquarie Radio Network would merge. The merger was finalised on 1 April 2015.

Despite having had a strong relationship in the 1930s through the Broadcast Services Association, by the 21st century 2UE had been a constant rival of 2GB for many decades. Both of these Sydney stations had offered a similar format. In the early 2010s 2UE slipped badly in the ratings, suffering major blows when long time breakfast program host Alan Jones moved across to the 2GB breakfast program and when broadcaster John Laws retired from radio, leaving his 2UE morning program at the end of 2007.

On 9 April 2015, with 2UE and 2GB now both owned by the newly merged Macquarie Radio Network, the 2UE newsroom was closed after 90 years with the last news report being broadcast at 6 pm that day. The news teams of both stations were merged with &quot;significant job cuts.&quot;

====Station ratings and market position====
In the eighth and final ratings survey for 2013, released on 10 December 2013, overall 2UE scored a 4.2% market share well behind market leader 2GB on 13.3 which was ahead of next placed ABC702 on 10.4. This rating placed 2UE tenth out of the 14 surveyed stations. During this survey period, its Monday to Friday share slipped to 3.2 per cent of the available audience, putting it behind Macquarie Radio Network&#x27;s 2CH which averaged 4.6 per cent and meant 2UE was only ahead of three stations. The 2UE drive show slipping a further 0.7 points after the firing of Jason Morrison in the middle of the survey, and evenings slipping further losing 2.6 points, its biggest drop in the survey.

====Cricket====
On 1 November 2013, 2UE&#x27;s parent company, Fairfax Radio Network (FRN), announced that it had signed a five-year contract commencing with the 2013/2014 Australian cricket season, to broadcast the Boxing Day and Sydney Test matches, all One Day Internationals, the Big Bash League (BBL) and International T20 matches on network stations including 2UE. Subsequently, in December 2013, FRN decided on an earlier start to their coverage by including the Perth test match which commenced on 13 December 2013. Fairfax stated that &quot;Fairfax Radio Network will bring to its coverage more than 60 years&#x27; experience of broadcasting sport, assembling a star-studded commentary line up&quot;. The coverage provided a ball-by-ball commentary of all broadcast matches.

The commentary team was anchored by Tim Lane and Bruce Eva, together with a panel consisting of the following experts

* Ian Chappell
* Allan Border
* Dean Jones
* Damien Fleming
* Michael Vaughan
* Henry Blofeld
* Greg Blewett
* Mickey Arthur
* Darren Lehmann
* Greg Matthews
====Controversy====
A number of parties have attempted to sue 2UE for defamation. In February 2012 Mamdouh Habib won his claim and was awarded almost $150,000. 2UE was found to have defamed journalist Ray Chesterton in an August 2005 broadcast made by John Laws.

===2016–2018: Talking Lifestyle===
In September 2016, 2UE relaunched with new branding and programming, moving away from its news talk position to a lifestyle format.

On Monday 27 February 2017, Macquarie Radio Network also launched the Talking Lifestyle format in Melbourne and Brisbane (Talking Lifestyle 1278 and Talking Lifestyle 882). Presenters broadcast from either Sydney or Melbourne.

, weekday presenters were:
*Overnight with David Prior
*Breakfast with John Stanley and Garry Linnell
*Mornings with Tim Webster
*Afternoons with Ed Phillips
*Finance with Peter Switzer
*Drive with Nick Bennett and Kayley Harris
*Technology with Trevor Long
*Late night with Jonathan Coleman
*Second Career with Matthew Tukaki

===2018–2020===

====Macquarie Sports Radio====

On Wednesday 4 April 2018, the three Talking Lifestyle branded stations relaunched with a new sports radio format under the name Macquarie Sports Radio with coverage of the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

A significant number of existing presenters did not return for the new format.

The change of the station was not received well by many fans of the former Talking Lifestyle station. There were even a number of recommendations about switching to the alternative talk station ABC Radio Sydney.

Macquarie Sports Radio 954 was the home of Sydney Swans and Greater Western Sydney Giants matches, as well as other selected AFL matches broadcast from 3AW, as well as the early Friday night NRL Game from NRL Nation.

On 29 October 2019, Macquarie Media announced that its sports talk shows would cease production from 1 November 2019. However, the station continued to broadcast live Test, Big Bash League and One Day International cricket matches during the summer months, as well as coverage of the English Premier League.

===2020s===

====Switch to all-music format====
On 21 January 2020, Nine announced the Macquarie Sports Radio brand would be abandoned and 2UE – along with its interstate sister stations Magic 1278 Melbourne and 4BH Brisbane – would return to an all-music format &quot;built around the best of the &#x27;&#x27;50s, &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s&quot; with a &quot;soft launch&quot; on 2 February 2020. In April, Steve Jacobs was announced as the station&#x27;s latest breakfast presenter, commencing on 27 April. All contracts with the sports leagues would be honoured, and the network has not ruled out sports broadcasts in the future.

====ACE Radio Operations====
On 28 October 2021, Nine Radio and ACE Radio entered into a deal for ACE to manage the radio station, along with sister stations Magic 1278 and 4BH from early 2022. Ace Radio took control of the station on 14 January 2022. The station relaunched with a new presenter line-up, logo and imaging on this date.

In 2024, 2UE&#x27;s presenters included the following: Trevor Sinclair, Gareth McCray, Cathy Jubb, Greg Allen and Dave Ferguson.

<text>The Jethro Tull Christmas Album is the 21st studio album released by Jethro Tull, on 30 September 2003. This was the band&#x27;s last studio album for 19 years (until the release of &quot;The Zealot Gene&quot; in 2022), as well as the last album to feature the lineup of Ian Anderson, guitarist Martin Barre (and his last album with the group), bassist Jonathan Noyce, keyboardist Andrew Giddings, and drummer Doane Perry.

==Content==
&quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot; is a mix of new material, re-recordings of Tull&#x27;s own suitably themed material and arrangements of traditional Christmas music. In 2009, the live album Christmas at St Bride&#x27;s 2008 was included with the original album on CD.

Of the opening song, &quot;Birthday Card at Christmas&quot;, Ian Anderson has said:

: &quot;My daughter Gael, like millions of other unfortunates, celebrates her birthday within a gnat&#x27;s whisker of Christmas. Overshadowed by the Great Occasion, such birthdays can be flat, perfunctory and fleetingly token in their uneventful passing. The daunting party and festive celebration of the Christian calendar overshadows too, some might argue, the humble birthday of one Mr. J. Christ. Funny old 25ths, Decembers…&quot;

==Track listing==
* Tracks 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 15 are all re-recordings of previously released pieces. &#x27;Bourée&#x27;, however, has significant alterations to the musical arrangement.
* &#x27;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&#x27; (Track 5) has been played in concert many times over the years: this is the first studio version.

<doc id="577198" wikidata="Q337446" url="?curid=577198" title="Fusae Ohta">
<text>is a Japanese politician, a former governor of Osaka prefecture, and the country&#x27;s first female prefectural governor. Her married name is . She is affiliated to the revisionist lobby Nippon Kaigi.

== Overview ==
Born in Kure, Hiroshima, she later moved to Toyohashi, Aichi.

After graduating from the University of Tokyo with an economics degree in 1976, Ohta entered the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. She served in MITI until 1997, when she became vice-governor of Okayama prefecture. She returned to the ministry in 1999.

Ohta became governor of Osaka prefecture after the resignation of Knock Yokoyama in 2000. She was re-elected in 2004, and after eight years in office was succeeded by lawyer and TV personality Tōru Hashimoto.

Osaka hosts the March sumo tournament, one of Japan&#x27;s six major tournaments, and the governor of each prefecture presents the &quot;Governor&#x27;s Prize&quot; to the champion of each tournament. Given the Sumo Association&#x27;s view that there is a traditional ban on women entering the &quot;dohyō&quot; (ring), and the ring would be &quot;violated&quot; by an &quot;unclean&quot; woman entering it, she was required to do so on the walkway beside the ring or send a male representative in her place. She repeatedly challenged the Sumo Association&#x27;s policy by requesting to be allowed to fulfill her traditional role as governor. Her requests were repeatedly rejected until she stepped down from office.

Ohta&#x27;s family name has been officially registered as Saitō (齊藤) since her marriage, but she uses her maiden name above for most public purposes.

Ohta&#x27;s family name is romanized as &quot;Ohta&quot; by the URL of her website (ohtafusae.jp), the state government of Hawaii, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Kansai Window, and Dawn Center. The name is romanized as &quot;Ota&quot; by WebJapan, the &quot;Japan Times&quot; and the BBC.
