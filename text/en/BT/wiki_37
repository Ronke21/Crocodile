<text>KNDS France (formerly known as Nexter, GIAT Industries or &quot;Groupement des Industries de l&#x27;Armée de Terre&quot;, Army Industries Group) is a French government-owned weapons manufacturer, based in Versailles. The company was wholly government-owned as GIAT from 1991 to 2006 and as Nexter from 2006 to 2015, when it merged with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) to form KNDS: a single company jointly owned, via holding companies, by the French state and the private owners of KMW. In 2024, Nexter was renamed KNDS France.

==Group organization==

KNDS France and its subsidiaries are divided into several smaller entities, with the main one being KNDS France. The sub-companies are:
* KNDS Ammo France
* KNDS Ammo Italy S.P.A
* KNDS Belgium
* KNDS France Mechanics
* KNDS France Robotics
* KNDS France Training
* KNDS OptSys
* KNDS CBRN

==History==
The GIAT group was founded in 1973 by combining the industrial assets of the technical direction of Army weapons of the French Ministry of Defense. The company was nationalized in 1991. On 22 September 2006 GIAT became the core of the new company Nexter.

For many years GIAT struggled to turn a profit. The company was operated at a loss. A 2001 report by the &quot;Cour des Comptes&quot; and a 2002 report by the National Assembly described the situation as critical. In April 2004 the board of directors presented the public with a financial statement showing a profit of several hundred million Euros. This was mainly due to increased export sales, and the modernization of the Leclerc Main Battle Tank (MBT) and several other armored platforms. Sales to the UAE however were accomplished with the payment of $200 million to intermediaries.

In 2006, the THL-20 gun turret was selected by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for use on the HAL Light Combat Helicopter, incorporating the 20 mm M621 cannon.

===Rebranding as Nexter (2006)===
On 21 September 2006, then-CEO Luc Vigneron announced that GIAT would soon complete a corporate restructuring that had been planned since 2003. The company&#x27;s legacy product lines would be grouped under a holding company that would retain the GIAT name, while those slated for future development and expansion would be separated into four subsidiaries, all branded with the name &quot;Nexter&quot;. The reorganization took effect on 1 December.

Nexter has a joint venture CTA International with BAE Systems to develop and manufacture case telescoped weapon systems and ammunition of 40 mm calibre.

Nexter continues to produce several former GIAT small arms, cannon, and anti-armour weapons. One such weapon is the Wasp 58, a low cost, one man antiarmour/assault weapon system.

In May 2014 Nexter bought two artillery shell manufacturers: Mecar in Petit-Roeulx-les-Nivelles Belgium, and Simmel Difesa in Colleferro Italy.

===Merger with KMW (2015)===
In 2015, Nexter and Krauss-Maffei merged under a single structure. The new KMW+Nexter Defense Systems (KNDS) will be the European leader of terrestrial defense with more than 6,000 employees. The supervisory board appointed the new CEO of Nexter Systems, Stéphane Mayer, and the chairman of the executive board of KMW, Frank Haun, as CEOs of the holding company.

On 24 October 2023, Nexter&#x27;s Mecar subsidiary announced that it had found an investment of €15 million for a 155mm artillery shell production facility. A guarantee by the Belgian Defense Ministry of €10 million was needed to initiate construction. In May 2024 the price of the munitions was between €7,000 and €10,000. The facility would be able to produce roughly 100 shells per day, which was then roughly a third of the number of heavy artillery shells produced at KNDS overall. At the time, Mecar did not have permission to handle explosives, so the shells needed to be sent away for final assembly. In May 2024 the Belgian defense minister Ludivine Dedonder signed a contract with Nexter to buy 4,000 shells annually for the next 20 years.

In February 2024 Nexter signed an agreement with a Saudi group called Wahaj that they would together develop a guided shell for use with the 156 CAESAR artillery delivery systems that were on order by the Saudi government, which had established more stringent precision standards than normal. The state-of-the-art ordnance systems used GPS and IMU; the newly-specified &quot;Sabir&quot; system would add a (drone-mounted) laser pointer feature and have a range of 60km. In addition, the Saudis prize the ITAR-free status of their new shells.

===Rebranding as KNDS France (2024)===

As a result of the merger of Nexter Systems into KNDS, the KNDS brand replaced the Nexter brand in June 2023. In April 2024, the Nexter Systems subsidiary was officially renamed KNDS France, while Krauss-Maffei Wegmann became KNDS Deutschland.

<text>The Royal Parks Constabulary (RPC) was the police force formerly responsible for the Royal Parks in London and a number of other locations in Greater London, England and Edinburgh, Scotland. Unlike most other police forces operating in England and Wales, the Royal Parks Constabulary did not report to the Home Office, but instead to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, who provided funding for it through the Royal Parks Agency.

The force was created in 1872 as the Royal Parks Keepers; keepers were given full police powers within the parks. They were renamed the Royal Parks Constabulary in 1974. Before 1872, Hyde Park had its own constables who lived in some of the entrance lodges and worked out of the rooms inside Marble Arch. One of the last Inspectors of those constables was Samuel Parkes, who won the Victoria Cross in the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854.

The constabulary worked towards maintaining the standards of Home Office police forces and all constables were trained at regional training centres, alongside their Home Office colleagues. Unlike council-run parks constabularies, constables of the RPC enjoyed full police powers in the parks under their control and had the power to instigate criminal proceedings for offences committed in the Royal Parks.

The force did not originally police Hyde Park. Instead, because of the potential for trouble at Speaker&#x27;s Corner, Hyde Park was policed by The Metropolitan Police from 1867 until 1993. At the beginning of 1993 the policing of Hyde Park was handed over to the Royal Parks Constabulary.

On 1 April 2004, following a review of the Royal Parks Constabulary by Anthony Speed, the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police took on the responsibility of policing the Royal Parks in Greater London. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 formally abolished the Royal Parks Constabulary in England. In Scotland, the powers were transferred to Historic Scotland (with security in Holyrood Park being provided by Historic Scotland&#x27;s own Ranger Service and aided by Lothian and Borders Police).

Many of the London-based officers from the Royal Parks Constabulary transferred into the new Metropolitan Police Royal Parks Operational Command Unit (OCU) — the new OCU is funded in the same way, through the Royal Parks Agency, with its funding &quot;ring-fenced&quot; to prevent it being diverted to other Metropolitan Police areas and many others transferred into British Transport Police, as within London, Royal Parks Constabulary paid to share a control room (and subsequent radio channels), crime recording systems and human resources functions with BTP.

The Royal Parks Constabulary&#x27;s white vehicles originally had orange decals; these were later replaced with yellow decals.

<text>&quot;The Song of the Cheerful (but slightly Sarcastic) Jesus&quot; is a poem by Oliver St. John Gogarty. It was written around Christmas of 1904 and was later published in modified form as &quot;The Ballad of Joking Jesus&quot; in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

==Original text==
The poem, like many of Oliver St. John Gogarty &#x27;s humorous verses, was written for the private amusement of his friends. In the summer of 1905, he sent a copy to James Joyce, then living in Trieste, via their common acquaintance Vincent Cosgrave. Joyce and Gogarty had quarreled the previous autumn, and Cosgrave presented the poem as a peace offering, writing Joyce that &quot;the appended song of J is of course Gogarty&#x27;s. He bids me send it. He desires you back in Dublin. ... It seems G desires reconciliation so that if you write to me be unequivocal.&quot;

&lt;poem&gt;
I&#x27;m the queerest young fellow that ever was heard.
My mother&#x27;s a Jew; my father&#x27;s a Bird
With Joseph the Joiner I cannot agree
So &#x27;Here&#x27;s to Disciples and Calvary.&#x27;

If anyone thinks that I amn&#x27;t divine,
He gets no free drinks when I&#x27;m making the wine
But have to drink water and wish it were plain
That I make when the wine becomes water again.

My methods are new and are causing surprise:
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes
To signify merely there must be a cod
If the Commons will enter the Kingdom of God

Now you know I don&#x27;t swim and you know I don&#x27;t skate
I came down to the ferry one day and was late.
So I walked on the water and all cried, in faith!
For a Jewman it&#x27;s better than having to bathe.

Whenever I enter in triumph and pass
You will find that my triumph is due to an ass
(And public support is a grand sinecure
When you once get the public to pity the poor.)

Then give up your cabin and ask them for bread
And they&#x27;ll give you a stone habitation instead
With fine grounds to walk in and raincoat to wear
And the Sheep will be naked before you&#x27;ll go bare.

The more men are wretched the more you will rule
But thunder out &#x27;Sinner&#x27; to each bloody fool;
For the Kingdom of God (that&#x27;s within you) begins
When you once make a fellow acknowledge he sins.

Rebellion anticipates timely by &#x27;Hope,&#x27;
And stories of Judas and Peter the Pope
And you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;ll never be left in the lurch
By children of Sorrows and Mother the Church

Goodbye, now, goodbye, you are sure to be fed
You will come on My Grave when I rise from the Dead
What&#x27;s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
And Olivet&#x27;s breezy—Goodbye now Goodbye.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Usage in &quot;Ulysses&quot;==
Always on the lookout for engaging quotations, Joyce decided to incorporate Gogarty&#x27;s poem into his work. An early manuscript fragment loosely connected with &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; places the first two stanzas in the mouth of Doherty, an early prototype of Buck Mulligan. Joyce later abridged and modified the poem for inclusion in the opening chapter of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, where it is sung by Mulligan, a character largely modeled on Gogarty.

&lt;poem&gt;
I&#x27;m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard
My mother&#x27;s a Jew, my father&#x27;s a bird.
With Joseph the Joiner I cannot agree
So here&#x27;s to disciples and Calvary.

If anyone thinks that I amn&#x27;t divine
He&#x27;ll get no free drinks when I&#x27;m making the wine
But have to drink water and wish it were plain
That I make when the wine becomes water again.

Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all that I said
And tell Tom, Dick, and Harry I rose from the dead.
What&#x27;s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
And Olivet&#x27;s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!
&lt;/poem&gt;

An apparition of Edward VII also recites a couplet from one of the unused stanzas (&quot;My methods are new and are causing surprise. To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes&quot;) during the chapter &quot;Circe&quot;.

Asked about his authorship of the poem later in life, Gogarty said, &quot;Yes I am guilty; but it shows Joyce&#x27;s mastery that nobody attributed the verses to me even though he quotes them almost accurately.&quot;

<doc id="569180" wikidata="Q1479412" url="?curid=569180" title="Plant propagation">
<text>Plant propagation is the process by which new plants grow from various sources, including seeds, cuttings, and other plant parts. Plant propagation can refer to both man-made and natural processes.

Propagation typically occurs as a step in the overall cycle of plant growth. For seeds, it happens after ripening and dispersal; for vegetative parts, it happens after detachment or pruning; for asexually-reproducing plants, such as strawberry, it happens as the new plant develops from existing parts.

Countless plants are propagated each day in horticulture and agriculture.

Plant propagation is vital to agriculture and horticulture, not just for human food production but also for forest and fibre crops, as well as traditional and herbal medicine. It is also important for plant breeding.

==Sexual propagation==

Seeds and spores can be used for reproduction (e.g. sowing). Seeds are typically produced from sexual reproduction within a species because genetic recombination has occurred. A plant grown from seeds may have different characteristics from its parents. Some species produce seeds that require special conditions to germinate, such as cold treatment. The seeds of many Australian plants and plants from southern Africa and the American west require smoke or fire to germinate. Some plant species, including many trees, do not produce seeds until they reach maturity, which may take many years. Seeds can be difficult to acquire, and some plants do not produce seed at all. Some plants (like certain plants modified using genetic use restriction technology) may produce seed, but not a fertile seed. In certain cases, this is done to prevent the accidental spreading of these plants, for example by birds and other animals.

==Asexual propagation==
Plant roots, stems, and leaves have a number of mechanisms for asexual or vegetative reproduction, which horticulturists employ to multiply or clone plants rapidly, such as in tissue culture and grafting. Plants are produced using material from a single parent and as such, there is no exchange of genetic material, therefore vegetative propagation methods almost always produce plants that are identical to the parent. 

In some plants, seeds can be produced without fertilization and the seeds contain only the genetic material of the parent plant. Therefore, propagation via asexual seeds or apomixis is asexual reproduction but not vegetative propagation.

Techniques for vegetative propagation include:
*Air or ground layering
*Division
*Grafting and bud grafting, widely used in fruit tree propagation
*Micropropagation
*Offsets
*Stolons (runners)
*Storage organs such as bulbs, corms, tubers, and rhizomes
*Striking or cuttings
*Twin-scaling

==Heated propagator==

A heated propagator is a horticultural device to maintain a warm and damp environment for seeds and cuttings to grow in. They generally provide bottom heat (maintained at a particular temperature) and high humidity, which is essential in successful seed germination and in helping cuttings to take root. In colder climates they are sometimes used for plants like peppers and sweet peas which need warmer environments (about 15°C, for the plants listed) in order to germinate. If excessive condensation forms on the inside of the lid, the gardener can open the ventilating holes to regulate the temperature a little.

Non-electric propagators (mainly a seed tray and a clear plastic lid) are a lot cheaper to purchase than a heated propagator, but without the constant regulated warmth and bottom heat provided by a heated propagator, growth of seedlings tends to be slower and less consistent (with increased risk of seeds failing to germinate).

==Seed propagation mat==
An electric seed-propagation mat is a heated rubber mat covered by a metal cage that is used in gardening. The mats are made so that planters containing seedlings can be placed on top of the metal cage without the risk of starting a fire. Another example is a &quot;seedling heat mat&quot;, multiple layers of durable, water resistant plastic material with insulated heating coils embedded inside (similar to underfloor heating systems, but with rubber mat instead of flooring). In extreme cold, gardeners place a loose plastic cover over the planters/mats which creates a sort of miniature greenhouse. The constant and predictable heat allows people to raise seedlings in the winter months when the weather is generally too cold for seedlings to survive naturally outside. When combined with a lighting system, many plants can be grown indoors using these mats. This can increase the variety of plants that a gardener can use.

<text>The Volkswagen Transporter (T4), marketed in North America as the Volkswagen EuroVan, is a van produced by the German manufacturer Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles between 1990 and 2004, succeeding the Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) and superseded by the Volkswagen Transporter (T5).

==History==
Introduced in 1990, the T4 was the first Volkswagen van to have a front-mounted, water-cooled engine. Prompted by the success of similar moves with their passenger cars, Volkswagen had toyed with the idea of replacing their air-cooled, rear-engined T2 vans with a front-engined, water-cooled design in the late 1970s. The reasons for deciding in 1980 to instead introduce a new rear-engined T3 are unclear. Thus, the introduction of a front-engined layout was delayed until the arrival of the T4. After a run of nearly 14 years, T4 production ceased in 2003, making it second only to the T1 for length of production in its home market.

==Chassis==

Part of the success of the T4 was its versatility. It was available in many forms and sizes as standard and formed the basis of many specialist vehicles, from buses to campervans to ambulances.

===Wheelbase===
Two standard wheelbases were available; a short (2920 mm) and a long (3320 mm) one.

===Body types===

====Van====
* Panel Van - without any windows behind the b-pillar; single row of seats
* Kombi or Half-Panel - with additional windows between the b and c-pillars; 2 rows of seats
* Caravelle, Multivan and (in the US) EuroVan - with windows all round; 3 rows of seats

====Pickup====
* Single cab - based on a SWB chassis
* Double cab - based on a LWB chassis (aka Doka, from the German: &quot;Doppelkabine&quot;)
* Razor back - with a hydraulic rear body that was produced between 1998 and 2000 in the UK

===Roofs===
Panel vans were available with two different roof heights; standard (1940mm) and high-top (2430mm). High-tops were only manufactured on the LWB chassis, although campervan conversions often have pop-top or (usually fibreglass) high-tops added to both SWB and LWB chassis.

===Doors===
Vans have either a single, roof-hinged &quot;tailgate&quot; or two &quot;barn&quot; doors at the rear and either a single (passenger side) or twin (both sides) sliding doors but they are commonly only on one side of the van, usually on the passenger side.

===Long and short-nose===

There was one major facelift to the T4, in 1996, when a reshaped, longer front end was introduced. This was needed to fit the six-cylinder VR6 engine into the T4&#x27;s engine bay. Initially, only Caravelles and Multivans were available with the longer nose, since these were the only models available with the VR6 engine.

The commercial variants continued to be produced with the shorter nose until 2003. However, campers and other specialist vehicles produced between 1996 and 2003 may have either the short or the long nose, depending on which model was used as the base vehicle. In keeping with the Type 2&#x27;s naming convention, the short and long-nose versions are also informally known as T4a and T4b, respectively.

===Four Wheel Drive (Syncro)===
The T4 was also available with a permanent 4WD system that uses a Viscous coupling unit as a centre differential to regulate the distribution of torque to the rear axle. These models are called &quot;syncro&quot; and were available with the 2.4D, 2.5Tdi and 2.5 petrol engines on all body types and both wheelbases. Some syncro models also have a mechanically locking rear differential. Since the rear differential precludes the placement of the spare wheel in the usual place under the body, syncro vans either store it inside the body or on an external, hinged bracket.

===Campervans===
The T4 is a very popular base for building a small to medium-sized camper and day-vans, both as self-build projects and for professional conversions. Volkswagen themselves also sold campervan versions of the T4. Outside of the US these were made by and named after their contractor, Westfalia-Werke. These Westfalia built campervans were named &#x27;California&#x27;, except in Canada where they were called simply &#x27;Westfalia&#x27;.

Winnebago Industries was the primary converter of VW T4 campers sold in the US.

==Enthusiasts&#x27; groups==
Due largely to its versatility, as well as popularity as a campervan, the Volkswagen Transporter (including the T4) has an extensive following amongst enthusiasts. Meetings are held regularly throughout the year in countries across Europe and there are several Internet forums dedicated to T4 owners and enthusiasts.

In May 2010, the German enthusiasts of the T4 held a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the production of the first T4. Several hundred T4s took part with vans from as far afield as Russia, France, Spain, central Europe and the Nordic countries.

==T4 in North America (EuroVan)==
The Transporter T4 was exported to North America from 1992 until 2003 under the moniker EuroVan.

In the United States, the short wheelbase EuroVan 5-cylinder passenger models (CL, GL, GLS, and MV) were only sold for model year 1993. Smaller than a standard American delivery van, but larger than an American or Japanese passenger minivan, Volkswagen played up its size with the slogan, &quot;EuroVan: There&#x27;s nothing mini about it&quot;. Volkswagen only imported them to the U.S. market for one year because sales in the United States were disappointing, but sales continued in Canada and Mexico. Volkswagen reintroduced the EuroVan passenger models in the United States for model year 1999 with a VR6 engine as standard, but discontinued the T4 worldwide after 2003. The manual gearbox was not offered in North America with the VR6 engine.

Volkswagen imported the short wheelbase EuroVan 5-cylinder petrol engine passenger models (CL, GL, GLS, MV Weekender and Westfalia Camperised) to Canada from 1991 to 1996. The 77 hp 2.4 litre diesel engine was optional in Canada between 1993 and 1996. The long wheelbase version was also on offer in 1992 only as a 10 seaters CL or GL model trim. Kombi and crewcab pickup versions (sold as Transporter) were also available in 1992. A panel version (LWB only) was sold from 1993 to 1997.

The EuroVan Camper by Winnebago was introduced to the United States and Canada in 1995 with the five-cylinder engine, and upgraded to the VR6 for the 1997-2003 models. These were only available on the longer wheelbase T4. These small pop top camper vans are unique in North America and have developed a cult following.

Winnebago also built three small Class C motorhomes with the forward cab of the T4/EuroVan called the Rialta, Vista, and Sunstar (Itasca branded). The Rialta was available in 1995-1996 with the five-cylinder engine, in 1997-2001 with the AES version of the VR6, and in 2002-2005 with the AXK engine. The Vista and Sunstar were only produced in 2002-2004, all using the AXK engine.

In the United States, the models were:
* the seven-seat EuroVan CL, GL, and GLS
* the EuroVan MV, in which the second row of seats face the rear and are removable, the third row converts into a bed, a folding table in the passenger area, window curtains, and a fluorescent lamp above table.
* the EuroVan MV Weekender, an MV plus a Westfalia conversion that adds a pop-top roof, a second overhead bed, bug screens for side windows and rear hatch, full set of curtains, auxiliary battery, fluorescent interior lights and under seat thermoelectric cooler.
* the EuroVan Camper, which is the long wheelbase commercial van converted by Winnebago Industries to include a pop-top roof, two two-person beds, seating for four (plus optional single or two-person seats in the middle), a one cubic foot refrigerator that runs on propane, DC, or AC, a propane furnace, a closet, cabinets, sink with cold water and a grey water tank, a two-burner propane stove, two two-person dinette tables, coach battery, house lighting, and the two front bucket seats made to swivel around to face the dinette/kitchen area. The 2000 EVC is long.

<text>Provideniya (; Chukchi: ) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) and the administrative center of Providensky District of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia, located on Komsomolskaya Bay (a part of Providence Bay) in the northeastern part of the autonomous okrug, across the Bering Strait from Alaska, and very close to the International Date Line. The population has declined in recent decades: 

==Geography==
Provideniya is a former Soviet military port, sited on a fjord sheltered from the Bering Sea. The largest inhabited locality east of Anadyr, it was established as a port to serve the eastern end of the Northern Sea Route. The port is found in Komsomolskaya Bay (named after the Soviet Komsomol youth organization), a part of the much larger Provideniya Bay, providing a suitable deep water harbor for Russian ships, close to the southern limits of the winter ice fields. Lake Istikhed is located south of Provideniya airfield, on the eastern side of the bay.

==History==
After discovery in 1660 of Providence Bay by the Russian expedition led by Kurbata Ivanov, the surrounding waters became a regular site for wintering fishing, whaling, and merchant ships. In the early 20th century, with the beginning of the development of the Northern Sea Route along the coast of the bay, a coal depot was constructed for refueling ships heading west back across the Arctic and in 1933 the first buildings of the future seaport were constructed in what would later become the settlement of Provideniya ( &quot;of Providence&quot;). In 1937, with the arrival of a convoy with building materials for the construction company &quot;Providenstroy&quot;, active construction of the port and the settlement began. On May 10, 1946, the settlement of Provideniya was officially established by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR. The settlement continued to grow quickly and military units began to be deployed here. On April 25, 1957, it was granted work settlement status. In 1975, it was planned to grow the settlement into a town with a population of twelve thousand and to rename it &quot;Dezhnyov&quot;. However, social and economic upheavals in the post-Soviet period left these plans unfulfilled and in the period from 1994 to 2002 no construction was undertaken at all.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Provideniya serves as the administrative center of Providensky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the urban-type settlement of Provideniya is incorporated within Providensky Municipal District as Provideniya Urban Settlement.

==Economy and infrastructure==
There is a technical school, one functioning movie theater, a post office, a museum of Chukotka history and culture, one of the only two ski slopes in Chukotka, a bakery complex, and port facilities.
==Transport==
The settlement is served by the Provideniya Bay Airport, the closest Russian airport to the United States.

Provideniya is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Doorway to the Arctic&quot;, and since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, tourism from nearby Alaska has given the local economy a significant boost. Bering Air, an Alaskan airline, offers charter services to the Provideniya Bay Airport from both Nome and Anchorage. Alaska Airlines made a Friendship Flight to Provideniya in July 1988. Chukotavia provides flights to Anadyr.
High-sprung transports connect the settlement&#x27;s concrete slabbed main street with outlying destinations along the fjord and coast.

==Demographics==
A significant proportion of the settlement&#x27;s current residents are Yupik, reflecting the high percentage of indigenous peoples in both Providensky and Chukotsky Districts. The settlement and the surrounding area struggle from alcoholism (which is especially high in indigenous areas), causing a high death rate, a low birth rate, and the population decline since 1990.

==Climate==
Provideniya has a dry-summer polar climate (Köppen &quot;ETs&quot;), although winters are not as severe due to the coastal location and colorful flowers help bring the tundra to life during the summer. Winter temperatures are significantly higher than at other places within Chukotka such as Uelen and Ushakovskoye, because it is a more southerly settlement with greater maritime influence from the Bering Sea, as is the case with nearby Nome in the US, which has similar winter conditions. Summers are generally cool and the settlement receives heavy rainfall, especially when low pressure systems move northwards from the Pacific Ocean. 

==Religion==
An evangelical church run by the local Moldovan community and missionaries is located in Provideniya. A Russian Orthodox church also operates.

<text>A debunker is a person or organization that exposes or discredits claims believed to be false, exaggerated, or pretentious. The term is often associated with skeptical investigation of controversial topics such as UFOs, claimed paranormal phenomena, cryptids, conspiracy theories, alternative medicine, religion, exploratory or fringe areas of scientific, or pseudoscientific research.

According to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, to &quot;debunk&quot; is defined as: &quot;to expose the sham or falseness of.&quot; The &quot;New Oxford American Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;debunk&quot; as &quot;expose the falseness or hollowness of (a myth, idea, or belief)&quot;.

If debunkers are not careful, their communications may backfire – increasing an audience&#x27;s long-term belief in myths. Backfire effects can occur if a message spends too much time on the negative case, if it is too complex, or if the message is threatening.

==Etymology==
The &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; traces the passage of the words &quot;bunk&quot; (noun), &quot;debunk&quot; (verb) and &quot;debunker&quot; (noun) into American English in 1923 as a belated outgrowth of &quot;bunkum&quot;. The first recorded use of the words was in 1828, apparently related to a poorly received &quot;speech for Buncombe County, North Carolina&quot; given by North Carolina representative Felix Walker during the 16th United States Congress (1819–1821).

The term &quot;debunk&quot; originated in a 1923 novel &quot;Bunk&quot;, by American journalist and popular historian W. E. Woodward (1874–1950), who used it to mean to &quot;take the out of things&quot;.

The term &quot;debunkery&quot; is not limited to arguments about scientific validity; it is also used in a more general sense at attempts to discredit any opposing point of view, such as that of a political opponent.

==Notable debunkers==

===Ancient===
* Cicero debunked divination in his philosophical treatise &quot;De Divinatione&quot; in 44 BCE.
* Sextus Empiricus debunked the claims of astrologers and dogmatic philosophers (c. 160 CE)
* Lucian wrote a book named &quot;Alexander the False Prophet&quot; against mystic and oracle Alexander of Abonoteichus (c. 105 – c. 170 CE) who led the Glycon cult then widely popular in the Roman Empire. He described Alexander&#x27;s alleged miracles as tricks, including the appearance of the god Glycon being an elaborate puppet. Lucian also describes him as using thuggery against critics to silence them, including himself.

==Backfire effects==

Australian Professorial Fellow Stephan Lewandowsky and John Cook, Climate Communication Fellow for the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland (and author at Skeptical Science) co-wrote &quot;Debunking Handbook&quot;, in which they warn that debunking efforts may backfire. Backfire effects occur when science communicators accidentally reinforce false beliefs by trying to correct them, a phenomenon known as belief perseverance.

Cook and Lewandowsky offer possible solutions to the backfire effects as described in different psychological studies. They recommend spending little or no time describing misconceptions because people cannot help but remember ideas that they have heard before. They write &quot;Your goal is to increase people&#x27;s familiarity with the facts.&quot; They recommend providing fewer and clearer arguments, considering that more people recall a message when it is simpler and easier to read. &quot;Less is more&quot; is especially important because scientific truths can get overwhelmingly detailed; pictures, graphs, and memorable tag lines all help keep things simple.

The authors write that debunkers should try to build up people&#x27;s egos in some way before confronting false beliefs because it is difficult to consider ideas that threaten one&#x27;s worldviews (i.e., threatening ideas cause cognitive dissonance). It is also advisable to avoid words with negative connotations. The authors describe studies which have shown that people abhor incomplete explanations – they write &quot;In the absence of a better explanation, [people] opt for the wrong explanation&quot;. It is important to fill in conceptual gaps, and to explain the cause of the misconception in the first place. The authors believe these techniques can reduce the odds of a &quot;backfire&quot; – that an attempt to debunk bad science will increase the audience&#x27;s belief in misconceptions.

&quot;The Debunking Handbook&quot;, 2020, explains that &quot;backfire effects occur only occasionally and the risk of occurrence is lower in most situations than once thought&quot;. The authors recommend to &quot;not refrain from attempting to debunk or correct misinformation out of fear that doing so will backfire or increase beliefs in false information&quot;.

<text>I Don&#x27;t Want You Back is the debut album by American R&amp;B singer Eamon, released in the United States on February 17, 2004. Produced by Milk Dee and Roy &quot;Royalty&quot; Hamilton, the album spawned two singles which combined modern hip hop with classic doo wop: &quot;Fuck It (I Don&#x27;t Want You Back)&quot; and &quot;I Love Them Ho&#x27;s (Ho-Wop)&quot;. The album garnered a mixed reception from critics who found the production too predictable and the repeated profanity wearing. The album debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 106,000 copies. It was certified Gold by the RIAA for selling over 500,000 copies.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

&quot;I Don&#x27;t Want You Back&quot; received generally mixed reviews from music critics who found the production by-the-numbers and felt that his potty-mouth gimmick wore thin. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic found a lot of filler in the album but said that it is &quot;still quite promising, especially with such a statement-making single.&quot; Entertainment.ie was mixed about the album&#x27;s tracks with their depiction of women, concluding that &quot;Eamon certainly has plenty of attitude and his album is undeniably good fun. But he also has a bit of growing up to do.&quot; Rob Kemp of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said he saw promise in Eamon through the album&#x27;s competent R&amp;B production and the track &quot;I Love Them Ho&#x27;s (Ho-Wop),&quot; concluding that &quot;you wonder if this modestly gifted kid has something special inside him that perhaps Kanye West or R. Kelly could coax out.&quot;

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found Eamon&#x27;s talent on the album limited, saying that the tracks that don&#x27;t mix his dirty mouth with Motown and doo-wop melodies aren&#x27;t &quot;clever or well-constructed enough to transcend the misogyny and double-standards put on whorish display.&quot; Despite praising Eamon&#x27;s vocals, the album&#x27;s beats and guest rap appearances, Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found the swearing crooner gimmick throughout the album wearing thin before it even ended. Robert Christgau graded the album as a &quot;dud&quot;, indicating &quot;a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.&quot; Elysa Gardner of &quot;USA Today&quot; criticized the album for its lack of humor or irony throughout the tracklist, saying that &quot;Eamon makes Eminem look like a standard-bearer for feminists.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
The album debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 106,000 copies. It dropped to number nine in its second week with sales dropping 31% to 73,000 copies. It was certified Gold by the RIAA and sold 591,000 copies as of June 2006.

<doc id="569199" wikidata="Q2829432" url="?curid=569199" title="Al-Yamamah arms deal">
<text>Al Yamamah () is the name of a series of record arms sales by the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia, paid for by the delivery of up to of crude oil per day to the British government. The prime contractor has been BAE Systems and its predecessor British Aerospace. The first sales occurred in September 1985 and the most recent contract for 72 Eurofighter Typhoon multirole fighters was signed in August 2006.

Mike Turner, then CEO of BAE Systems, said in August 2005 that BAE and its predecessor had earned £43 billion in twenty years from the contracts and that it could earn £40 billion more. It is Britain&#x27;s largest ever export agreement, and employs at least 5,000 people in Saudi Arabia.

In 2010, BAE Systems pleaded guilty in a United States court to charges of false accounting and making misleading statements in connection with the sales. An investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office into the deal was discontinued after political pressure from the Saudi and British governments.

==Background==
The UK was already a major supplier of arms to Saudi Arabia prior to Al Yamamah. In 1964 the British Aircraft Corporation conducted demonstration flights of their Lightning aircraft in Riyadh and in 1965 Saudi Arabia signed a letter of intent for the supply of Lightning and Strikemaster aircraft as well as Thunderbird surface to air missiles. The main contract was signed in 1966 for 40 Lightnings and 25 Strikemasters (eventually raised to 40). In 1973 the Saudi government signed an agreement with the British government which specified BAC as the contractor for all parts of the defence system (AEI was previously contracted to supply the radar equipment and Airwork Services provided servicing and training). Overall spending by the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) was over £10 billion (SAR 57 billion).

In the 1970s, United States defence contractors won major contracts, including 114 Northrop F-5s. In 1981 the RSAF ordered 46 F-15Cs and 16 F-15Ds, followed in 1982 by the purchase of 5 E-3A AWACS aircraft. Following these deals and partly due to pro-Israeli sentiment in the US Congress, which would have either blocked a deal or insisted on usage restrictions for exported aircraft, Saudi Arabia turned to the UK for further arms purchases.

==Summary==
The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported Saudi Arabian &quot;interest&quot; in the Panavia Tornado in July 1984. Export had become a possibility after West Germany lifted its objections to exports outside of NATO. In September 1985 Saudi Arabia agreed &quot;in principle&quot; to a Tornado, Hawk and missile deal. On 26 September 1985 the defence ministers of the UK and Saudi Arabia sign a Memorandum of Understanding in London for 48 Tornado IDSs, 24 Tornado ADVs, 30 Hawk training aircraft, 30 Pilatus PC-9 trainers, a range of weapons, radar, spares and a pilot-training programme. The second stage (Al Yamamah II) was signed on 3 July 1988 in Bermuda by the defence ministers of the UK and Saudi Arabia.

Although the full extent of the deal has never been fully clarified, it has been described as &quot;the biggest [British] sale ever of anything to anyone&quot;, &quot;staggering both by its sheer size and complexity&quot;. At a minimum, it is believed to involve the supply and support of 96 Panavia Tornado ground attack aircraft, 24 Air Defence Variants (ADVs), 50 BAE Hawk and 50 Pilatus PC-9 aircraft, specialised naval vessels, and various infrastructure works. The initial Memorandum of Understanding committed the UK to purchasing the obsolete Lightning and Strikemaster aircraft, along with associated equipment and spare parts.

The British government&#x27;s prime contractor for the project is BAE Systems. BAE has approximately 4,000 employees working directly with the Royal Saudi Air Force (also see Military of Saudi Arabia).

The success of the initial contract has been attributed to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who lobbied hard on behalf of British industry. A Ministry of Defence briefing paper for Thatcher detailed her involvement in the negotiations:

There were no conditions relating to security sector reform or human rights included in the contracts. Contracts between BAE Systems and the Saudi government have been underwritten by the Export Credits Guarantee Department, a tax-payer funded insurance system. Guarantees on a contract worth up to £2.7 billion were signed by the Government on 1 September 2003. In December 2004, the Commons Trade Committee chairman, Martin O&#x27;Neill, accused the Government of being foolish for concealing a £1 billion guarantee they have given to BAE Systems.

===Al Yamamah I===
*48 Panavia Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike aircraft)
**28 GR1 standard
**6 GR1A reconnaissance standard
**14 dual control trainers
*24 Panavia Tornado ADVs, equivalent to RAF&#x27;s Tornado F3 standard
*JP233 runway denial munition
*Sea Eagle anti-ship missile
*ALARM anti-radar missile
* Skyflash air-to-air missile

The first aircraft (two Hawks) were delivered on 11 August 1987 at BAE&#x27;s Dunsfold facility.

===Eurofighter Typhoon (al-Salam) ===

In December 2005 the governments of the UK and Saudi Arabia signed an &quot;Understanding Document&quot; which involved the sale of Typhoon aircraft to replace RSAF Tornados and other aircraft. Although no details were released, reports suggested the deal involved the supply of 72 aircraft. On 18 August 2006 a contract was signed for 72 aircraft. The aircraft cost approximately £4.43 billion, and the full weapons system is expected to cost approximately £10 billion.

===Tornado upgrade===
In February 2006 &quot;Air Forces Monthly&quot; suggested that the eventual Eurofighter order may reach 100 and the deal could include the upgrade of the RSAF&#x27;s Tornado IDS aircraft, likely similar to the RAF&#x27;s Tornado GR4 standard. In an editorial the magazine also raises the prospect of a requirement for a new lead-in fighter trainer to replace the earlier generation of Hawk 65/65As and to provide adequate training for transition of pilots to the advanced Typhoon. BAE System&#x27;s 2005 Interim Report noted that three RSAF Tornado IDS&#x27; arrived at their Warton facility for design evaluation tests with the ultimate aim being &quot;to improve serviceability, address obsolescence, and enhance and sustain the capability of the aircraft&quot;. On 10 September 2006 BAE won a £2.5 bn (€3.7 bn, $4.6 bn) contract for the upgrade of 80 RSAF Tornado IDS aircraft.

==Corruption allegations==
There have been numerous allegations that the Al Yamamah contracts were a result of bribes to members of the Saudi royal family and government officials.

Some allegations suggested that the former prime minister&#x27;s son Mark Thatcher may have been involved; however, he has strongly denied receiving payments or exploiting his mother&#x27;s connections in his business dealings.

In February 2001, the solicitor of a former BAE Systems employee, Edward Cunningham, notified Serious Fraud Office of the evidence that his client was holding which related to an alleged &quot;slush fund&quot;. The SFO wrote a letter to Kevin Tebbit at the MoD who notified the Chairman of BAE Systems but not the Secretary of Defence. No further action was taken until the letter was leaked to and reported on by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in September 2003.

In May 2004, Richard Evans appeared before parliament&#x27;s defence select committee and said: &quot;I can certainly assure you that we are not in the business of making payments to members of any government.&quot;

In October 2004, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Money Programme&quot; broadcast an in-depth story, including allegations in interviews with Edward Cunningham and another former insider, about the way BAE Systems alleged to have paid bribes to Prince Turki bin Nasser and ran a secret £60 million slush fund in relation to the Al Yamamah deal. Most of the money was alleged to have been spent through a front company called Robert Lee International Limited.

In June 2007 the BBC&#x27;s investigative programme &quot;Panorama&quot; alleged that BAE Systems &quot;paid hundreds of millions of pounds to the ex-Saudi ambassador to the US, Prince Bandar bin Sultan&quot;.

In his book, David Wearing uses the example of F&amp;C Asset Management, a major institutional investor, who (despite benefiting in the short term) warned the defence procurement minister that it would reduce the efficient functioning of financial markets as a whole. &quot;We believe that, for long term investors, bribery and corruption distort and de-stabilise markets, expose companies to legal liabilities, disadvantage non-corrupt companies and reduce transparency&quot;, thus undermining national legislation governing corrupt practices.

===1992 NAO report===
The National Audit Office (NAO) investigated the contracts and has so far not released its conclusions; the only NAO report ever to be withheld. Official statements about the contents of the report go no further than to state that the then chairman of the Public Accounts Commission, now Lord Sheldon, considered the report in private in February 1992, and said: &quot;I did an investigation and I find no evidence that the MOD made improper payments. I have found no evidence of fraud or corruption. The deal ... complied with Treasury approval and the rules of Government accounting.&quot;

In July 2006, John Bourn, the head of the NAO, refused to release a copy to the investigators of an unpublished report into the contract that had been drawn up in 1992.

The MP Harry Cohen said, &quot;This does look like a serious conflict of interest. Sir John did a lot of work at the MoD on Al Yamamah and here we now have the NAO covering up this report.&quot; In early 2002 he had proposed an Early Day Motion noting &quot;that there have been ... allegations made of large commission payments made to individuals in Saudi Arabia as part of ... Al Yamamah ... [and] that Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network have received substantial funds from individuals in Saudi Arabia.&quot;

===Serious Fraud Office investigation===
The Serious Fraud Office was reported to be considering opening an investigation into an alleged £20 million slush fund on 12 September 2003, the day after &quot;The Guardian&quot; had published its slush fund story. The SFO also investigated BAE&#x27;s relationship with Travellers World Limited.

In November 2004, the SFO made two arrests as part of the investigation. BAE Systems stated that they welcomed the investigation and &quot;believe[d] that it would put these matters to rest once and for all&quot;.

In late 2005, BAE refused to comply with compulsory production notices for details of its secret offshore payments to the Middle East. The terms of the investigation was for a prosecution under Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.

====Threats by the Saudi government====
At the end of November 2006, when the long-running investigation was threatening to go on for two more years, BAE Systems was negotiating a multibillion-pound sale of Eurofighter Typhoons to Saudi Arabia. According to the BBC the contract was worth £6 billion with 5,000 people directly employed in the manufacture of the Eurofighter, while other reports put the value at £10 billion with 50,000 jobs at stake.

On 1 December, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ran a front-page headline suggesting that Saudi Arabia had given the UK ten days to suspend the Serious Fraud Office investigation into BAE/Saudi Arabian transactions or they would take the deal to France, but this threat was played down in other quarters. A French official had said &quot;the situation was complex and difficult ... and there was no indication to suggest the Saudis planned to drop the Eurofighter.&quot; This analysis was confirmed by Andrew Brookes, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who said &quot;there could be an element here of trying to scare the SFO off. Will it mean they do not buy the Eurofighter? I doubt it.&quot;

There were reports of a systematic PR campaign operated by Tim Bell through newspaper scare stories, letters from business owners and MPs in whose constituencies the factories were located to get the case closed.

Robert Wardle, head of the SFO, also stated (in a later High Court challenge, see below) that he had received a direct threat of a cessation of counterterrorist co-operation from the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the UK, in the first of three meetings held to assess the seriousness of the threat: &quot;as he put it to me, British lives on British streets were at risk&quot;.

Article 5 of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery prohibits the decision to drop investigations into corruption from being influenced by considerations of the national economic interest or the potential effect upon relations with another state. This does not however explicitly exclude grounds of national security.

This prompted the investigation team to consider striking an early guilty plea deal with BAE that would minimise the intrusiveness to Saudi Arabia and mitigate damage. The Attorney General agreed the strategy, but briefed Prime Minister Blair, who in a reply dated 5 December 2006 urged that the case be dropped. Despite affirming his government&#x27;s commitment to bribery prosecution, he stressed the financial and counter-terrorism implications. That same day, Prince Bandar met with Foreign Office officials, after spending a week with Jacques Chirac to negotiate a French alternative to the BAE deal.

A week later, after consultation with the SFO, the Attorney General met with Blair to argue against dropping the case. It was Blair&#x27;s opinion that &quot;Any proposal that the investigation be resolved by parties pleading guilty to certain charges would be unlikely to reduce the offence caused to the Saudi Royal Family, even if the deal were accepted, and the process would still drag out for a considerable period&quot;.

On 13 December, the Director of the SFO wrote to the Attorney General to inform him that the SFO was dropping the investigation and would not be looking into the Swiss bank accounts, citing &quot;real and imminent damage to the UK&#x27;s national and international security and would endanger the lives of British citizens and service personnel&quot;.

====Investigation discontinued====
On 14 December 2006, the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith announced that the investigation was being discontinued on grounds of public interest. The 15-strong team had been ordered to turn in their files two days before. The statement in the House of Lords read:

The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, justified the decision by saying &quot;Our relationship with Saudi Arabia is vitally important for our country in terms of counter-terrorism, in terms of the broader Middle East, in terms of helping in respect of Israel and Palestine. That strategic interest comes first.&quot;

Jonathan Aitken, a former Conservative government minister and convicted perjurer, who was connected with the deals in the 1980s, said that even if the allegations against BAE were true, it was correct to end the investigation to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia.

Mark Pieth, director of anti-fraud section at the OECD, on behalf of France, Greece, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States, addressed a formal complaint letter before Christmas 2006 to the Foreign Office, seeking explanation as to why the investigation had been discontinued. Transparency International and Labour MP Roger Berry, chairman of the Commons Quadripartite Committee, urged the government to reopen the corruption investigation.

In a newspaper interview, Robert Wardle, head of the Serious Fraud Office, acknowledged that the decision to terminate the investigation may have damaged &quot;the reputation of the UK as a place which is determined to stamp out corruption&quot;.

Delivery of the first two Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft (of 72 purchased by the Saudi Air Force) took place in June 2009.

====Judicial review====
A judicial review of the decision by the SFO to drop the investigation was granted on 9 November 2007. On 10 April 2008 the High Court of Justice ruled that the SFO acted unlawfully by dropping its investigation. &quot;The Times&quot; described the ruling as &quot;one of the most strongly worded judicial attacks on government action&quot; which condemned how &quot;ministers &quot;buckled&quot; to &quot;blatant threats&quot; that Saudi cooperation in the fight against terror would end unless the ... investigation was dropped.&quot;

On 24 April the SFO was granted leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the ruling. There was a two-day hearing before the Lords on 7 and 8 July 2008. On 30 July the House of Lords unanimously overturned the High Court ruling, stating that the decision to discontinue the investigation was lawful.

===OECD investigation===
The OECD sent their inspectors to the UK to establish the reasons behind the dropping of the investigation in March 2007. The OECD also wished to establish why the UK had yet to bring a prosecution since the incorporation of the OECD&#x27;s anti-bribery treaty into British law.

===US Department of Justice investigation===
On 26 June 2007 BAE announced that the United States Department of Justice had launched its own investigation into Al Yamamah. It was looking into allegations that a US bank had been used to funnel payments to Prince Bandar. The Riggs Bank has been mentioned in some accounts. On 19 May 2008, BAE confirmed that its CEO Mike Turner and non-executive director Nigel Rudd had been detained &quot;for about 20 minutes&quot; at George Bush Intercontinental and Newark airports respectively the previous week and that the DOJ had issued &quot;a number of additional subpoenas in the US to employees of BAE Systems plc and BAE Systems Inc as part of its ongoing investigation&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; suggested that, according to Alexandra Wrage of Trace International, such &quot;humiliating behaviour by the DOJ&quot; is unusual towards a company that is co-operating fully.

Under a plea bargain with the US Department of Justice BAE was sentenced in March 2010 by US District Court Judge John D. Bates to pay a $400 million fine, one of the largest fines in the history of the DOJ. US District Judge John Bates said the company&#x27;s conduct involved &quot;deception, duplicity and knowing violations of law, I think it&#x27;s fair to say, on an enormous scale&quot;. BAE was not convicted of bribery, and is thus not internationally blacklisted from future contracts.

<text>BBC Scotland is a division of the BBC and the main public broadcaster in Scotland. Its headquarters are in Glasgow, employing approximately 1,250 staff as of 2017, to produce 15,000 hours of television and radio programming per year. BBC Scotland operates television channels such as the Scottish variant of BBC One, the BBC Scotland channel and the Gaelic-language channel BBC Alba, and radio stations BBC Radio Scotland and Gaelic-language BBC Radio nan Gàidheal.

It is one of the four BBC national broadcasters, together with the BBC English Regions, BBC Cymru Wales and BBC Northern Ireland. Some £320 million of licence fee revenue is raised in Scotland, with expenditure on purely local content set to stand at £86 million by 2016–2017. The remainder of licence fee revenue raised in the country is spent on networked programmes shown throughout the UK, with BBC Scotland producing over 880 hours worth of programming for UK–wide broadcast on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three, CBBC and CBeebies. BBC Scotland output reached on average 94% of Scottish audiences in July 2013.

==History==
===Radio services===

The first radio service in Scotland was launched by the British Broadcasting Company on 6 March 1923. Named 5SC and located in Bath Street in Glasgow, the services gradually expanded to include the new stations 2BD, 2DE and 2EH, based at Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh respectively. Around 1927, the new Corporation, as the BBC now was, decided to combine these local stations into regions under the generic banner of the BBC Regional Programme. Regional programmes throughout the UK were merged to form the BBC Home Service in 1939, and, with a break for the Second World War, national opt outs remained on the station and its successor BBC Radio 4 until the establishment of a separate BBC Radio Scotland in November 1978.

===Television services===

Television in Scotland began formally on 14 March 1952 using the 405-line television system broadcast from the Kirk o&#x27;Shotts transmitter. In the beginning, all programmes came from London but some with Scottish content were made using an outside broadcast unit. By 1962, there were plans for television news interview studios in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Eventually, BBC Scotland established the right to &quot;opt-out&quot; of the network more and more. When BBC Two arrived in Scotland in 1966 (having begun in London two years earlier and spread across the country), broadcasts began in black and white on 405-lines from the Black Hill transmitter. BBC Two upgraded to PAL colour in 1967 (including Scotland) across the UK, with BBC One (network programmes only at first, with local output still in black-and-white) and STV following in December 1969, and in 1971, BBC Scotland&#x27;s Queen Margaret Drive Studio &quot;A&quot; in Glasgow became one of the first regional studios in Britain to upgrade to colour.

In September 1998, BBC Choice Scotland was launched as BBC Scotland&#x27;s first digital service.

===Recent years===

For many years, BBC Scotland has tried to increase the number of programmes it makes to be shown on the networks. This ambition was greatly aided by the move of BBC Scotland&#x27;s headquarters in 2007 from Queen Margaret Drive to BBC Pacific Quay where state of the art digital studios were built. In March 2021, a decision was taken by the BBC to relocated jobs and departments from London to other parts of the BBC network, including BBC Scotland. As part of the restructure, the technology team for the BBC moved from London to Glasgow. Productions by the BBC such as &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, &quot;Newsnight Review&quot; and &quot;at least one Saturday night primetime show&quot; would be relocated to Scotland, produced by BBC Scotland in Glasgow.

The BBC&#x27;s flagship political and debating programme, &quot;Question Time&quot;, had its permanent base moved to Glasgow in 2009. The relocation of &quot;Question Time&quot; to Glasgow sparked some controversy, with former executive producer of the programme, George Carey, claiming the move from London to Glasgow would &quot;editorially weaken the show and increase costs&quot;.

==Current services==
===Television===

BBC Scotland broadcasts three television services to Scottish audiences. BBC One Scotland is a separate channel able to opt out of the network feed of BBC One to broadcast its own schedule of regional programming in addition to networked productions. The flagship news programme &quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot; is presented by Laura Miller and Sally Magnusson. Additionally, BBC One Scotland broadcasts several Scottish specific broadcasting, such as &quot;Sportscene&quot;, &quot;BBC Scotland Investigates&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Show&quot;.

BBC Scotland operates BBC Alba, broadcasting programming in Gaelic for up to seven hours a day. The channel is a joint partnership between BBC Scotland and MG Alba and is available across the UK on satellite and cable services and Freeview in Scotland only. During downtime, BBC Alba simulcasts Gaelic radio station BBC Radio nan Gàidheal with an in-vision graphical overlay. Prior to digital switchover, some Gaelic programming was carried on BBC Two Scotland, however this ceased following the switchover.

Thirdly, the BBC Scotland channel commenced broadcasting at 7:00 p.m. on Sunday 24 February 2019. On 22 February 2017, director general Tony Hall announced plans to launch a dedicated English-language BBC Scotland channel in 2018, which would replace the BBC Two Scotland opt-out. It would broadcast from 7:00 p.m. to midnight nightly, and feature a lineup composed entirely of new and archived Scottish programming, including a new hour-long 9:00 p.m. weeknight newscast that will be produced from Scotland. The proposed newscast been considered a response to the perennial proposals for a local opt-out of the &quot;BBC News at Six&quot;. Hall also announced that the BBC would increase its overall spending on factual and drama productions in Scotland by £20 million annually. The BBC Scotland channel was approved by Ofcom in June 2018, and subsequently launched on 24 February 2019. The channel is allocated £32 million in annual funding, and its SD variant has displaced BBC Four on the Freeview EPG.

Programming for the BBC Scotland channel include &quot;Debate Night&quot;, &quot;The Entertainment Mix&quot; and &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Home of the Year&quot;. The stations flagship news programme, &quot;The Nine&quot;, was broadcast from February 2019 until December 2024, when it was replaced by a new shorter programme, &quot;Reporting Scotland: News at Seven&quot;, which airs directly following its sister programme, &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot;, which is broadcast on BBC One Scotland.

===Radio===
BBC Scotland also operates two radio stations covering Scotland: BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio nan Gàidheal. The former broadcasts English programming 24 hours a day on the frequencies 92-95 FM and 810 MW. The station has specific programming opt outs for Orkney and Shetland in addition to regional news opt outs for four additional sub regions - North East, Highlands &amp; Islands, South West and Borders. BBC Radio nan Gàidheal in contrast is a Gaelic-language station broadcasting for the majority of the day on 103.5-105 FM and simulcasting Radio Scotland&#x27;s MW service at other times.

===Online and interactive===
BBC Scotland operates a mini site on BBC Online consisting of a portal to Scottish news, sport, programmes and items of cultural interest through BBC Online. The department also provides content from Scotland on these subjects to the website and for the BBC Red Button interactive TV service.

BBC Scotland previously offered a podcast download of the top news items of the week and the online streaming of several key sections of output. However following the widespread introduction of the BBC iPlayer service, which allowed the streaming and download of nearly all BBC programmes including news, these services were discontinued as defunct.

BBC The Social is a digital content stream from BBC Scotland aimed at 18-34 year olds. Working with new and emerging talent, The Social develops daily content on a range of subjects including issues, comedy, music, lifestyle and gaming. Launched in December 2015, The Social won a Royal Television Scotland award for Best Digital Innovation in 2016 and another in 2018 for the shortform drama Kidder.

In June 2018, the BBC announced the formation of a third &quot;digital hub&quot; in Glasgow, which will facilitate design and engineering of BBC digital platforms.

==Studios==
===Early studios===

BBC Scotland began broadcasting in Scotland on 10 October 1923 from the Aberdeen studios in Belmont Street, Aberdeen. The first broadcast for the station was at risk of being impacted by severe gales which resulted in telephone wires being damaged, however, following extensive work by engineers to resolve the damage and associated issues, the broadcast went ahead as planned with minimal issues. Stonehaven did experience issues with the broadcast however, which was later accredited to issues relating to climate.

When the new commercial broadcaster, Scottish Television (STV), was about to arrive in 1957, BBC Scotland managed to produce slightly improved news coverage by a complicated arrangement involving the newsroom in Queen Margaret Drive in the west of the city and the former Black Cat Cinema in Springfield Road in the east where &quot;The White Heather Club&quot; was made.

===Rex House===

Upon the launch of the BBC in Scotland in 1923, the service originally occupied Rex House at 202 Bath Street, Glasgow, before moving to properties in Blythswood Square and subsequently in West George Street. In 1929, the decision was made to move the headquarters operation to Queen Street, Edinburgh, where the Edinburgh station had been based since 1924 following a move from the original 79 George Street premises. However, in 1935 the BBC acquired Queen Margaret College at North Park House, Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow, near to the Glasgow Botanic Gardens, and the headquarters operation moved back to Glasgow in 1936 accompanying the Glasgow radio station. BBC Scotland remained based at these premises until the move to Pacific Quay in 2007. The Edinburgh operation remained on Queen Street until the move to The Tun in April 2002. The Tun building is near to the Scottish Parliament building and contains television and radio studios in addition to a newsroom.

The college closed in 1935 and principal architect James Miller began adapting the Glasgow site for BBC Scotland in 1936, allowing for the site&#x27;s buildings to be used in the production, administration and broadcasting of BBC Scotland&#x27;s radio and television.(RCAHMS)

In the early 1960s, the BBC acquired land adjacent to its Queen Margaret Drive base and eventually three colour studios were built together with significant radio facilities and a Film Unit with its own film processing. The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra had access to a large sound studio - Studio 1, from 1937 until 2006 when it moved from Studio 1 to the newly-rebuilt City Halls in Merchant City area of Glasgow.

===Pacific Quay===
BBC Scotland&#x27;s headquarters are currently located at BBC Pacific Quay on the banks of the River Clyde in Glasgow. The BBC had outgrown their old headquarters in Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow. The need to move to a new location was also in part due to changing technology, with the network having a &quot;desire to move with the times beyond a less than fit for purpose HQ to a new building which would avail us of the latest digital technology to offer improved quality to audiences&quot;. 

In July 1999 the BBC announced that around 800 staff would be moving to a new building that would be located at Pacific Quay. The BBC held a competition to design a new building with more than seventy companies attracted. By March 2001 there was a shortlist of seven entries.

The studio centre was constructed between July 2004 and August 2006 and was opened in September 2007 by then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Designed by David Chipperfield and reportedly costing £188 million, the studio contains three television studios and five radio studios as well as the first HD newsroom used by the BBC.

===Other locations===

In addition to the Glasgow and Edinburgh bases of the broadcaster, BBC Scotland also has offices and studios located in Aberdeen, Dundee, Portree, Stornoway, Inverness, Selkirk, Dumfries, Kirkwall and Lerwick. Of these, the latter two locations operate radio opt-outs from BBC Radio Scotland with BBC Radio Orkney and BBC Radio Shetland while the Aberdeen, Inverness, Selkirk and Dumfries newsrooms produce local radio bulletins for the North East, Highlands &amp; Islands, Borders and South West respectively.

In addition to these premises, BBC Scotland operates a drama productions studio at Dumbarton on the site of a disused whisky distillery. It is the main Scottish drama facilities where programmes such as &quot;Still Game&quot; and &quot;River City&quot; are recorded. Also, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra is resident at Glasgow City Halls having been based at Queen Margaret Drive until 2006.

==Programming==

===Current programming===
BBC Scotland continues to produce a high number of local programmes for the Scottish audiences. Its flagship news and current affair programmes are &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot; and &quot;Scotland 2016&quot; which provides over an hour of content each weekday. Drama in the form of &quot;River City&quot;. With sport on Radio Scotland, along with &quot;Sportscene&quot;, cover a large number of local sports including football, rugby and bowls. BBC Scotland also produces over 20 hours of comedy programmers for radio and television, while features and documentaries is BBC Scotland&#x27;s biggest output, with &quot;The Beechgrove Garden&quot;, &quot;Landward&quot;, &quot;Sport Monthly&quot;, &quot;The Adventure Show&quot;, &quot;The Mountain&quot;, &quot;BBC Scotland Investigates&quot; and many other covering all aspect of Scottish life. BBC Scotland output was watched by 40.3% of the Scottish television audience in 2013. 

Output for the British network has included such recent high-profile dramas as &quot;Shetland&quot;, &quot;Hope Springs&quot;, &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; and &quot;Single Father&quot;. BBC Scotland also produces a high number of gamesshows which feature &quot;The National Lottery Draws&quot;. BBC Scotland also produces the Scottish opt-out sections of British-wide programmes such as &quot;Sunday Politics&quot; and &quot;Children in Need&quot;.

Until 2010, a high number of Gaelic programmes were broadcast on BBC One and Two Scotland before transferring over to BBC Alba. Its flagship programmes, which both started in 1993, are &quot;Dè a-nis?&quot; and &quot;Eòrpa&quot;. &quot;Eòrpa&quot; hit the headlines in May 2008, specially mentioned in the Scottish Broadcasting Commission&#x27;s report. &quot;It was intriguing to note that without fail at every one of our public events, BBC2 Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Eòrpa&quot; programme was raised, unsolicited, and by non-Gaelic speakers, as an example of a positive, well-respected programme&quot;, commented Blair Jenkins, the Chair of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission. It continued to be given a broadcast on BBC Two Scotland as the only Gaelic programme on the channel until 2019 when it moved to BBC Alba.

===Past programming===

Over the years, BBC Scotland made a number of well known radio and television programmes both for the BBC networks and for transmission in Scotland only. In television these were known within the BBC as &quot;opt out&quot; programmes, with BBC Scotland given the responsibility for producing Scotland related programming to reflect Scottish culture and life.

At teatime in the beginning, there was &quot;A Quick Look Round&quot; with Leonard Maguire. From 1968, as well as the flagship evening news programme &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot;, presented by Mary Marquis and Douglas Kynoch, with contributions from Renton Laidlaw in Edinburgh and Donny B. MacLeod in Aberdeen, there were popular current affairs series such as &quot;Compass&quot;, &quot;Checkpoint&quot; with Professor Esmond Wright and Magnus Magnusson, &quot;Person to Person&quot; with Mary Marquis, &quot;Current Account&quot;, &quot;Public Account&quot; and &quot;Agenda&quot;.

Many comedy series have been made by BBC Scotland, including &quot;Scotch and Wry&quot;, &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot;, &quot;Naked Video&quot; and &quot;Still Game&quot;, while with dramas included &quot;Hamish Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot;, and &quot;Sutherland&#x27;s Law&quot;. In recent years, BBC Scotland comedy shows such as &quot;Mrs. Brown&#x27;s Boys&quot;, &quot;Two Doors Down&quot; and &quot;Mountain Goats&quot;.

BBC Scotland has also produced two highly controversial programmes, &quot;Scotch on the Rocks&quot; and &quot;Secret Society&quot;, with the latter resulting in BBC Scotland being raided by the police.

==Television continuity announcers==
BBC Scotland started using their own television continuity announcers voicing over specific BBC Scotland station idents for all evening and weekend afternoon junctions around 1977. Before this, announcers only introduced occasional opt-outs, which resulted in the London announcer being heard most of the time, the Scottish announcer wasn&#x27;t even heard before Reporting Scotland because in those days the early evening Regional News magazines began with a &#x27;throw&#x27; from the Nationwide programme. The announcers were &quot;self-op&quot; - they had to speak and press the buttons to change the sound and picture and cue in telecine (film), videotape recordings (VTR) and live programmes.

From 1979, their duties were expanded to cover reading the lunchtime news bulletin in vision at 12:40, just before the network &quot;Midday News&quot; at 12:45.

There was one announcer who was never seen. Robert Logan was also a Conservative local councillor. Consequently, he never read the news summaries, nor did he ever give his name at closedown. From 1985, the announcing team started doing a news summary just before children&#x27;s programmes at around 15:53, and within a few weeks, additional news summaries at 21:25 were introduced. From 31 October 1988, newsroom staff started to read the news summaries instead of the announcers.

Inevitably, though, viewers started to spot their little idiosyncrasies. Mark Stephen often came perilously close to sending up programmes with his good-natured humour; links of his included:

<text>Jeanette Mary Fitzsimons (née Gaston; 17 January 1945 – 5 March 2020) was a New Zealand politician and environmentalist. She was the co-leader of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand from 1995 to 2009, and was a Member of Parliament from 1996 to 2010.

==Early life==
Born in Dunedin on 17 January 1945, Fitzsimons was the daughter of Doris Mary Gaston (née Harrison) and John Fisher Gaston. She was raised in nearby Mosgiel, and in Waiuku, near Auckland, and was educated at Waiuku District High School from 1957 to 1959, and then Epsom Girls&#x27; Grammar School in Auckland between 1960 and 1961. She studied French and music at the University of Auckland from 1962 to 1964, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and was considered a talented violinist. She also earned a Diploma of Education.

After teaching at her old school, Epsom Girls&#x27; Grammar, in 1966 and 1967, Fitzsimons lived in Geneva, Switzerland, from 1968 to 1974, where she joined Friends of the Earth and the Environmental Defence Society. When the Values Party was formed to contest the 1972 New Zealand general election, her father sent her newspaper clippings about the party and she became interested in its environmentalist-based policies. When she returned to New Zealand in 1974, she joined the party.

From 1980 to 1992, Fitzsimons was a lecturer in environmental studies and energy planning at the University of Auckland. She was also active in environmental organisations such as the New Zealand Biological Producers&#x27; Council and the Environmental Council and worked as an environmental consultant to local authorities.

==Political career==
Fitzsimons&#x27; first entry into politics was with the Values Party. At the 1977 local body elections she stood as a Values Party candidate for the Auckland Regional Authority in the Auckland City and Waiheke Island ward, she was unsuccessful polling second to last. She was its energy spokesperson from 1977 to 1982, and stood as a candidate in the 1978 and 1981 elections in the Remuera electorate. When the Values Party merged with a number of other groups to form the Green Party, Fitzsimons became an active member of the new organisation.

When the Green Party joined with several other left-wing parties to form the Alliance Party, Fitzsimons became co-deputy leader, a position she held from 1992 to 1999. In the 1993 election, Fitzsimons unsuccessfully contested the Hauraki electorate under the Alliance banner. In 1995, she became co-leader of the Green Party, which remained within the Alliance.

===Member of Parliament===



In the 1996 election, the first to be conducted under the new MMP electoral system, Fitzsimons was placed third on the Alliance party list. She also stood as the party&#x27;s candidate in the Coromandel. She was unsuccessful in the Coromandel electorate, but entered Parliament on the Alliance list.

In 1998, Fitzsimons&#x27; Energy Efficiency Bill was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. It was eventually passed into law as the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000.

The Greens contested the 1999 election as an independent party, with Fitzsimons and Rod Donald serving as co-leaders. Fitzsimons was placed first on the party&#x27;s list, and once again contested the Coromandel seat. To observers, it seemed that the Greens&#x27; chances of entering parliament were dependent on Fitzsimons&#x27; performance in Coromandel; in order to receive proportional representation, the party needed to either gain five percent of the national vote or win an electorate seat, and it appeared that the former option was unlikely. Labour Leader (and Prime Minister after the election) Helen Clark encouraged Labour supporters to give their constituency vote to Fitzsimons and their party vote to Labour. When normal votes had been counted, it appeared that Fitzsimons had been defeated in Coromandel by National&#x27;s Murray McLean, but when special votes were tallied, Fitzsimons had a narrow lead. This guaranteed the Green Party seats in parliament regardless of whether it crossed the five percent threshold.

In her second term, Fitzsimons promoted bills to extend New Zealand&#x27;s nuclear-free zone and to reduce road traffic. Both were defeated at their second readings.
In the 2002 election, Fitzsimons was defeated in Coromandel. She remained in Parliament on the Green Party&#x27;s list, and remained co-leader of the party until 2009.

Following the 2005 election, she became the spokeswoman for the government&#x27;s solar heating promotion initiatives. This was agreed to as part of a policy package negotiated by the Green Party in exchange for its undertaking not to oppose the Labour-led Government on matters of confidence and supply until the next parliamentary elections. In the 2005 term, Fitzsimons had three member&#x27;s bills drawn, addressing climate change and dog microchipping. None passed, though her Resource Management (Climate Protection) Amendment Bill did reach a second reading.

Fitzsimons was a list only candidate in the 2008 election and retained a seat in Parliament as she was ranked at number one on the party list.

In February 2009, Fitzsimons announced that she would step down as party co-leader, and she was replaced by Metiria Turei on 30 May 2009. In June 2009, her Sustainable Biofuel Bill was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. The bill passed its first reading, but was subsequently defeated at its second reading on 4 April 2012 by a vote of 69–51, with National, New Zealand First, ACT and United Future opposing it.

Fitzsimons left Parliament on 11 February 2010, and was replaced by the next candidate on the Green Party list, Gareth Hughes, whose biography of Fitzsimons was published in 2022.

She was the Green Party spokesperson on Climate Change, Energy, Finance &amp; Revenue, Genetic Engineering, Research, Science &amp; Technology, Sustainable Economics, Transport and Treaty Issues (Associate Spokesperson).

=== Post-retirement life ===
Fitzsimons continued an active involvement in environmental causes following her retirement from politics. In 2013, she joined Greenpeace executive director Bunny McDiarmid on a ship which was protesting oil drilling off the coast of Raglan. In 2017, she was part of a group of protesters who chained themselves to a gate at Fonterra&#x27;s Clandeboye factory in South Canterbury as a protest against the company&#x27;s use of coal.

She was a patron of the Soil &amp; Health Association, and on the advisory board of the University of Otago Centre for Sustainability.

=== Recognition ===
&quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; named her New Zealand Politician of the Year in 2007. In October 2008, respondents to a ONE News Colmar Brunton poll regarded Fitzsimons as the most trustworthy political party leader in New Zealand. In the 2010 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Fitzsimons was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for public services.

==Personal life==
Fitzsimons was married twice. She married her first husband, Bevin Fitzsimons in 1966, and they moved to Geneva, Switzerland in 1968. They lived there for six years and had two sons while in Geneva. After divorcing in 1986, she remarried, to Harry Renford Parke, in 1994. In 1991, Fitzsimons and Parke bought land in the Kauaeranga Valley east of Thames at the base of the Coromandel Peninsula and established Pakaraka Farm. The farm operates from solar power and micro-hydro power systems and sells olive oil, chestnut products, pecans and livestock.

== Death ==
On 5 March 2020, Fitzsimons suffered a fall on her farm. She died in Thames Hospital of a stroke in the evening of the same day, aged 75. Politicians from across the political spectrum including her Green colleagues and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern paid tribute to her.

<text>Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an organosulfur compound with the formula (CH3)2. This colorless liquid is the sulfoxide most widely used commercially. It is an important polar aprotic solvent that dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds and is miscible in a wide range of organic solvents as well as water. It has a relatively high boiling point. DMSO is metabolised to compounds that leave a garlic-like taste in the mouth after DMSO is absorbed by skin.

In terms of chemical structure, the molecule has idealized Cs symmetry. It has a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry consistent with other three-coordinate S(IV) compounds, with a nonbonded electron pair on the approximately tetrahedral sulfur atom.

==Synthesis and production==
Dimethyl sulfoxide was first synthesized in 1866 by the Russian scientist Alexander Zaytsev, who reported his findings in 1867. Its modern use as an industrial solvent began through popularization by Thor Smedslund at the Stepan Chemical Company. Dimethyl sulfoxide is produced industrially from dimethyl sulfide, a by-product of the Kraft process, by oxidation with oxygen or nitrogen dioxide.

==Reactions==

===Reactions with electrophiles===
The sulfur center in DMSO is nucleophilic toward soft electrophiles and the oxygen is nucleophilic toward hard electrophiles. With methyl iodide it forms trimethylsulfoxonium iodide, [(CH3)3SO]I:

:(CH3)2SO + CH3I → [(CH3)3SO]I

This salt can be deprotonated with sodium hydride to form the sulfur ylide:

:[(CH3)3SO]I + NaH → (CH3)2S(CH2)O + NaI + H2

===Acidity===
The methyl groups of DMSO are only weakly acidic, with a . For this reason, the basicities of many weakly basic organic compounds have been examined in this solvent.

Deprotonation of DMSO requires strong bases like lithium diisopropylamide and sodium hydride. Stabilization of the resultant carbanion is provided by the S(O)R group. The sodium derivative of DMSO formed in this way is referred to as &quot;dimsyl sodium&quot;. It is a base, e.g., for the deprotonation of ketones to form sodium enolates, phosphonium salts to form Wittig reagents, and formamidinium salts to form diaminocarbenes. The dimsyl anion is a potent nucleophile.

===Oxidant===
In organic synthesis, DMSO is used as a mild oxidant. It forms the basis of several selective sulfonium-based oxidation reactions including the Pfitzner–Moffatt oxidation, Corey–Kim oxidation and the Swern oxidation. The Kornblum oxidation is conceptually similar. These methods all involve formation of an intermediate sulfonium species (R2S+OX where X is a heteroatom attached to oxygen).

===Ligand and Lewis base===

Related to its ability to dissolve many salts, DMSO is a common ligand in coordination chemistry. Illustrative is the complex dichlorotetrakis(dimethyl sulfoxide)ruthenium(II) (RuCl2(dmso)4). In this complex, three DMSO ligands are bonded to ruthenium through sulfur. The fourth DMSO is bonded through oxygen. In general, the oxygen-bonded mode is more common.

In carbon tetrachloride solutions DMSO functions as a Lewis base with a variety of Lewis acids such as I2, phenols, trimethyltin chloride, metalloporphyrins, and the dimer Rh2Cl2(CO)4. The donor properties are discussed in the ECW model. The relative donor strength of DMSO toward a series of acids, versus other Lewis bases, can be illustrated by C-B plots.

==Applications==

===Solvent===

DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent and is less toxic than other members of this class, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, &quot;N&quot;-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). DMSO is frequently used as a solvent for chemical reactions involving salts, most notably Finkelstein reactions and other nucleophilic substitutions. It is also extensively used as an extractant in biochemistry and cell biology. Because DMSO is only weakly acidic, it tolerates relatively strong bases and as such has been extensively used in the study of carbanions. A set of non-aqueous pKa values (C-H, O-H, S-H and N-H acidities) for thousands of organic compounds have been determined in DMSO solution.

Because of its high boiling point, , DMSO evaporates slowly at normal atmospheric pressure. Samples dissolved in DMSO cannot as easily be recovered compared to other solvents, as it is very difficult to remove all traces of DMSO by conventional rotary evaporation. One technique to fully recover samples is removal of the organic solvent by evaporation followed by addition of water (to dissolve DMSO) and cryodesiccation to remove both DMSO and water. Reactions conducted in DMSO are often diluted with water to precipitate or phase-separate products. The relatively high freezing point of DMSO, , means that at, or just below, room temperature it is a solid.

In its deuterated form (DMSO-&quot;d&quot;6), it is a useful solvent for NMR spectroscopy, again due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of analytes, the simplicity of its own spectrum, and its suitability for high-temperature NMR spectroscopic studies. Disadvantages to the use of DMSO-&quot;d&quot;6 are its high viscosity, which broadens signals, and its hygroscopicity, which leads to an overwhelming H2O resonance in the 1H-NMR spectrum. It can be mixed with CDCl3 or CD2Cl2 for lower viscosity and melting points.
DMSO is used to dissolve test compounds in &quot;in vitro&quot; drug discovery and drug design screening programs, including high-throughput screening programs. This is because it is able to dissolve both polar and nonpolar compounds, can be used to maintain stock solutions of test compounds (important when working with a large chemical library), is readily miscible with water and cell culture media, and has a high boiling point (this improves the accuracy of test compound concentrations by reducing room temperature evaporation). One limitation with DMSO is that it can affect cell line growth and viability, with low DMSO concentrations sometimes stimulating cell growth, and high DMSO concentrations sometimes inhibiting or killing cells.

DMSO is used as a vehicle in &quot;in vivo&quot; studies of test compounds. It has, for example, been employed as a co-solvent to assist absorption of the flavonol glycoside Icariin in the nematode worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;. As with its use in &quot;in vitro&quot; studies, DMSO has some limitations in animal models. Pleiotropic effects can occur and, if DMSO control groups are not carefully planned, then solvent effects can falsely be attributed to the prospective drug. For example, even a very low dose of DMSO has a powerful protective effect against paracetamol (acetaminophen)-induced liver injury in mice.

DMSO finds some use in manufacturing processes to produce microelectronic devices. It is widely used to strip photoresist in TFT-LCD &#x27;flat panel&#x27; displays and advanced packaging applications (such as wafer-level packaging / solder bump patterning). 

===Biology===
DMSO is used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to inhibit secondary structures in the DNA template or the DNA primers. It is added to the PCR mix before reacting, where it interferes with the self-complementarity of the DNA, minimizing interfering reactions.

DMSO in a PCR is applicable for supercoiled plasmids (to relax before amplification) or DNA templates with high GC-content (to decrease thermostability). For example, 10% final concentration of DMSO in the PCR mixture with Phusion decreases primer annealing temperature (i.e. primer melting temperature) by .

It is well known as a reversible cell cycle arrester at phase G1 of human lymphoid cells.

DMSO may also be used as a cryoprotectant, added to cell media to reduce ice formation and thereby prevent cell death during the freezing process. Approximately 10% may be used with a slow-freeze method, and the cells may be frozen at or stored in liquid nitrogen safely.

In cell culture, DMSO is used to induce differentiation of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells into cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells.

===Medicine===
Use of DMSO in medicine dates from around 1963, when an Oregon Health &amp; Science University Medical School team, headed by Stanley Jacob, discovered it could penetrate the skin and other membranes without damaging them and could carry other compounds into a biological system. In medicine, DMSO is predominantly used as a topical analgesic, a vehicle for topical application of pharmaceuticals, as an anti-inflammatory, and an antioxidant. Because DMSO increases the rate of absorption of some compounds through biological tissues, including skin, it is used in some transdermal drug delivery systems. Its effect may be enhanced with the addition of EDTA. It is frequently compounded with antifungal medications, enabling them to penetrate not just skin but also toenails and fingernails.

DMSO has been examined for the treatment of numerous conditions and ailments, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its use only for the symptomatic relief of patients with interstitial cystitis. A 1978 study concluded that DMSO brought significant relief to the majority of the 213 patients with inflammatory genitourinary disorders that were studied. 

In interventional radiology, DMSO is used as a solvent for ethylene vinyl alcohol in the Onyx liquid embolic agent, which is used in embolization, the therapeutic occlusion of blood vessels.

In cryobiology DMSO has been used as a cryoprotectant and is still an important constituent of cryoprotectant vitrification mixtures used to preserve organs, tissues, and cell suspensions. Without it, up to 90% of frozen cells will become inactive. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10% DMSO, a freezing medium, and 30% fetal bovine serum. In the cryogenic freezing of heteroploid cell lines (MDCK, VERO, etc.) a mixture of 10% DMSO with 90% EMEM (70% EMEM + 30% fetal bovine serum + antibiotic mixture) is used. As part of an autologous bone marrow transplant the DMSO is re-infused along with the patient&#x27;s own hematopoietic stem cells.

DMSO is metabolized by disproportionation to dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl sulfone. It is subject to renal and pulmonary excretion. A possible side effect of DMSO is therefore elevated blood dimethyl sulfide, which may cause a blood borne halitosis symptom.

===Alternative medicine===
DMSO&#x27;s popularity as an alternative medicine is stated to stem from a March 1980 &quot;60 Minutes&quot; documentary &quot;The Riddle of DMSO&quot; and April 1980 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article covering the treatments of ardent DMSO advocate Dr. Stanley Jacob beginning in the 1960s.

The use of DMSO as an alternative treatment for cancer is of particular concern, as it has been shown to interfere with a variety of chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. There is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that DMSO has any effect, and most sources agree that its history of side effects when tested warrants caution when using it as a dietary supplement, for which it is marketed heavily with the usual disclaimer. DMSO is an ingredient in some products listed by the U.S. FDA as fake cancer cures and the FDA has had a running battle with distributors. One such distributor is Mildred Miller, who promoted DMSO for a variety of disorders and was consequently convicted of Medicare fraud.

===Veterinary medicine===
DMSO is commonly used in veterinary medicine as a liniment for horses, alone or in combination with other ingredients. In the latter case, often, the intended function of the DMSO is as a solvent, to carry the other ingredients across the skin. Also in horses, DMSO is used intravenously, again alone or in combination with other drugs. It is used alone for the treatment of increased intracranial pressure and/or cerebral edema in horses.

===Taste===
The perceived garlic taste upon skin contact with DMSO may be due to nonolfactory activation of TRPA1 receptors in trigeminal ganglia. Unlike dimethyl and diallyl disulfides (which have odors resembling garlic), mono- and tri- sulfides (which typically have foul odors), and similar odiferous sulfur compounds, the pure chemical DMSO is odorless.

==Safety==

===Toxicity===
DMSO is a non-toxic solvent with a median lethal dose higher than ethanol (DMSO: LD50, oral, rat, 14,500 mg/kg; ethanol: LD50, oral, rat, 7,060 mg/kg).

DMSO can cause contaminants, toxins, and medicines to be absorbed through the skin, which may cause unexpected effects. DMSO is thought to increase the effects of blood thinners, steroids, heart medicines, sedatives, and other drugs. In some cases this could be harmful or dangerous.

Because DMSO easily penetrates the skin, substances dissolved in DMSO may quickly be absorbed. Glove selection is important when working with DMSO. Butyl rubber, fluoroelastomer, neoprene, or thick (15mil / 0.4mm) latex gloves are recommended. Nitrile gloves, which are very commonly used in chemical laboratories, may protect from brief contact but have been found to degrade rapidly with exposure to DMSO.

=== Regulation ===

In Australia, it is listed as a Schedule 4 (S4) Drug, and a company has been prosecuted for adding it to products as a preservative.

=== Clinical safety ===

Early clinical trials with DMSO were stopped because of questions about its safety, especially its ability to harm the eye. The most commonly reported side effects include headaches and burning and itching on contact with the skin. Strong allergic reactions have been reported.

On September 9, 1965, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that a manufacturer of the chemical warned that the death of an Irish woman after undergoing DMSO treatment for a sprained wrist may have been due to the treatment, although no autopsy was done, nor was a causal relationship established. Clinical research using DMSO was halted and did not begin again until the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) published findings in favor of DMSO in 1972. In 1978, the US FDA approved DMSO for treating interstitial cystitis. In 1980, the US Congress held hearings on claims that the FDA was slow in approving DMSO for other medical uses. In 2007, the US FDA granted &quot;fast track&quot; designation on clinical studies of DMSO&#x27;s use in reducing brain tissue swelling following traumatic brain injury.

DMSO exposure to developing mouse brains can produce brain degeneration. This neurotoxicity could be detected at doses as low as 0.3mL/kg, a level exceeded in children exposed to DMSO during bone marrow transplant.

===Odor problem===
DMSO disposed into sewers can cause odor problems in municipal effluents: waste water bacteria transform DMSO under hypoxic (anoxic) conditions into dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that has a strong disagreeable odor, similar to rotten cabbage. However, chemically pure DMSO is odorless because of the lack of C-S-C (sulfide) and C-S-H (mercaptan) linkages. Deodorization of DMSO is achieved by removing the odorous impurities it contains.

===Explosion hazard===
Dimethyl sulfoxide can produce an explosive reaction when exposed to acyl chlorides; at a low temperature, this reaction produces the oxidant for Swern oxidation.

DMSO can decompose at the boiling temperature of 189 °C at normal pressure, possibly leading to an explosion. The decomposition is catalyzed by acids and bases and therefore can be relevant at even lower temperatures. A strong to explosive reaction also takes place in combination with halogen compounds, metal nitrides, metal perchlorates, sodium hydride, periodic acid and fluorinating agents.

<text>The Snares penguin (Eudyptes robustus; ), also known as the Snares crested penguin and the Snares Islands penguin, is a penguin from New Zealand. The species breeds on the Snares Islands, a group of islands off the southern coast of the South Island. It is a yellow-crested penguin, with a size of and a weight of . It has dark blue-black upper parts and white underparts. It has a bright yellow eyebrow-stripe which extends over the eye to form a drooping, bushy crest. It has bare pink skin at the base of its large red-brown bill.

The species nests in colonies ranging in size from around 10 nests to around 1200, under forest cover or the open. The main colonies are located on North East Island; other colonies are established on Broughton Island as well as the rocky Western Chain.

The Snares penguin&#x27;s main prey is krill, supplemented by squid and small fish. The species is rated as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as its breeding range is restricted to one small island group. The population is estimated at around 25,000 breeding pairs.

== Nomenclature ==
Snares penguins were originally collected in 1874 and named &quot;atrata&quot; by Frederick Hutton. However, Hutton lost his sample at sea whilst drawing the bird before a full speciation could be identified. A description written by Hutton and an illustration done by Keulemans in Buller&#x27;s &quot;A History of the Birds of New Zealand&quot; are evidence that this is the same penguin previously identified by Hutton.

Hutton married Annie Gouger Montgomerie in 1863, and resigned his commission in 1866 to travel with his wife and two children to New Zealand, where four more children would follow. They lived initially in Waikato, where Hutton tried his hand at flax milling, but he soon changed back to geology, joining the Geological Survey of New Zealand in 1866 and becoming Provincial Geologist of Otago in 1874. At the same time, he was made lecturer in geology at the University of Otago and curator of the museum there.

Hutton became professor of biology at Canterbury College in 1880, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1892. The following year, he also took on the curatorship of the Canterbury Museum. Towards the end of his life, Hutton was made president of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union and the New Zealand Institute. He was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1891.

However, there is some debate over the classification of this penguin, and Oliver was able to successfully propose that a few slight anatomical differences did exist between the Snares penguins and the early description and illustration, leading the Snares penguin to be called &quot;robustus&quot; instead of &quot;atratus&quot;.

== Description ==
The Snares penguin is often compared to the Fiordland penguin (&quot;Eudyptes pachyrhynchus&quot;), which is related by the genus of crested penguins (&quot;Eudyptes&quot;). Snares penguins can be distinguished from Fiordland penguins by a patch of skin at the base of their beaks. The Snares penguin is similarly coloured to other species of penguins, having a black head, back and flippers with a white belly. A bright-yellow crest, beginning at the base of the bill, runs along the upper part of the head on both sides and ends at the back of the head. It has a thick reddish-brown beak, traced with light pink skin at the base. The eyes are generally described as a bright red-brown colour, but this colouration can vary somewhat between individuals and in different lighting. The colour patterns under the wings differ from individual to individual, so it is not a good characteristic for species identification. 
The penguin can make a large variety of vocal noises. It is difficult to verbally describe these noises, but they range from hisses and explosive cries when threatened to rhythmical braying and trumpeting sounds that can be heard from long distances at sea.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Snares penguin is named after the place in which it breeds
—the Snares Islands. The Snares Islands are a small group of islands off the coast of southern New Zealand. Although little is known of their range and migration outside of the breeding season, it is not thought that they migrate far in the winters. Occasional sightings have occurred on the coasts of Tasmania, southern Australia, the Chatham Islands, Stewart Island, and the southern New Zealand mainland. There are approximately 25,000 living pairs of Snares penguins.
Snares penguins nest in dense colonies under the tree cover of the Olearia forests or on coastal rocks. To build a nest, the penguins dig up shallow holes in the ground and layer the bottom with grass, leaves, twigs, peat, or pebbles. A small rim of mud is added to the rim of the nest to raise it above ground level. Vegetation at nesting sites dies dues to the dense nesting activities, and the colony moves to a new nesting site. Colonies nesting near streams may have some advantage, as the stream provides water for drinking and bathing. However, it is not essential that nesting colonies are located near a stream and many are far from any stream.

=== Conservation ===
Although Snares penguins are not currently threatened, they are considered a vulnerable species. If a threat arose, it could quickly wipe out their population because their breeding grounds are confined to a small island group. Possible threats include the introduction of a new predator, overfishing around the islands that would deplete their food source, increasing water temperatures from global warming driving prey away, and pollution. The New Zealand government has taken action to protect the Snares Islands habitats and marine feeding grounds.

== Behaviour ==

===Diet===
The diet of Snares penguins usually consists of krill of the species &quot;Nyctiphanes australis&quot;, small fish, and cephalopods. One study found that about 60 percent of the mass of stomach contents from Snares penguins consisted of krill, 30 percent was fish, and about 10 percent was cephalopods. The researchers concluded that the number of fish otoliths and cephalopod beaks indicated the importance of these types of prey to adult penguins while at sea. Another study reports the diet consisting of about 55 percent krill, 24 percent fish, and 21 percent cephalopods, also suggesting that fish and cephalopods are more important prey types than the percentages of stomach composition indicate.

===Foraging ecology===
The foraging patterns of breeding Snares penguins are well defined. After shared incubation of eggs, males leave on two-week-long foraging trips, which has been found to be synchronised with spring plankton blooms, as they are reliable predictors of food sources. Upon the return of the males, the females go on somewhat shorter foraging trips (less than a week), returning in time for the chicks to hatch. Throughout the chick guard stage, the female is the lone provider of food performing short foraging trips (one to three days). While male penguins performing long foraging trips reach depths of up to 120 m, chick rearing birds usually exhibit shallow pursuit diving strategies (average dive depths 20–40 m) to catch prey.

===Predators===
Predators of adult Snares penguins are sea lions and leopard seals. Their eggs and chicks are vulnerable to predation by skuas and petrels.

=== Courtship and breeding ===
The breeding season of Snares penguins occurs in the summer of New Zealand, beginning in early September and ending in late January. Snares penguins begin reproducing in the age range of 5 to 9 years old. To court females, single males stand erect with their wings spread out and pumping their chest. It is likely that the pairs remain faithful to each other for more than one season. The pairs then build a nest, most of the work being done by the male. The female lays two eggs, typically about three to five days apart, which hatch 31–37 days later. The second laid egg is up to 85 percent larger than the first and also hatches first. The smaller, later-hatched chick is outcompeted by its siblings and usually does not survive, also called &quot;siblicide&quot;. Egg-size dimorphism is particularly large in Snares penguins, and the larger egg hatching first only accentuates the sibling size difference.

Hatching pattern and size-dimorphic eggs are two of the mechanisms by which birds can change their breeding pattern in response to environmental and breeding conditions. In altricial birds, such as Snares penguins, egg-size variation and asynchronous hatching are adaptive mechanisms that may lead to brood reduction. However, Snares penguins and other members of their genus, &quot;Eudyptes&quot;, differ from most other birds in that their last laid egg is larger and hatches first rather than being the smallest and last to hatch.

Egg incubation does not occur until both eggs have been laid, and they are usually incubated one in front of the other. The smaller, first-laid egg is often placed in the anterior position for incubation, which is thought to be the less favourable location since they have lower and more variable temperatures during incubation. Although the smaller, first egg receives less favourable incubation, it was found that egg-size dimorphism affects the hatching pattern in Snares penguins instead of egg incubation position. Both parents incubate the eggs. For the first ten days, they alternate. Then the male leaves for an extended period (about 12 days) to forage for food, while the mother stays with the eggs. When he returns, the roles are reversed. Also, upon his return, the pair engages in a display of bowing and trumpeting, which further strengthens their bond.

For the first three weeks after hatching, the male guards the chicks from predators while the female searches for food, returning each day to feed her offspring. It was observed that parents can recognise their chicks and chicks can recognise their parents. The study found that calls between chick and parent were more important for recognition than visual cues. The parents provide food for their young each day until it has moulted and can forage for its own food. The chicks fledge at approximately 11 weeks.

<doc id="569217" wikidata="Q4042479" url="?curid=569217" title="LMS Jubilee Class">
<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Jubilee Class is a class of steam locomotive designed for main line passenger work. 191 locomotives were built between 1934 and 1936. They were built concurrently with the similar looking LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0. They were nicknamed &quot;Red Staniers&quot; (due to their crimson liveries) and &quot;Jubs&quot;.

==History==
The last five locomotives of Henry Fowler&#x27;s Patriot class on order, 5552 to 5556, were built with William Stanier&#x27;s taper boiler and so became the first of the Jubilee class. 113 locomotives were ordered straight from the drawing board. They were initially a disappointment; their moderate degree of superheating often left them short of steam. Changes to the blastpipe and chimney dimensions helped to transform them.

On 29 April 1935 no. 5552, the first of the class, permanently swapped identities with no. 5642 which had been named &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot; on 19 April 1935 in recognition of the Silver Jubilee of King George V on 6 May of that year. This change gave the name to the rest of the class, see LMS Jubilee Class 5552 Silver Jubilee. Earlier on (from summer 1934), they had been known as the &quot;Red Staniers&quot; (because of the crimson livery), to distinguish them from the &quot;Black Staniers&quot; (the LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 class). These engines were named after former Commonwealth states and countries of the British Empire, British admirals, British naval commanders, and finally, ships in the British Navy named after characters from Greek Mythology.

Until the late 1950s, Jubilees were the largest express engine normally found on the lines running out of St Pancras. They practically monopolized the role of the main express engine, with the occasional Royal Scot popping up, or radiating from Derby. They could nevertheless be found on main lines throughout the former LMS system. They were also regarded as a powerful upgrade from both of the older Compound 4-4-0 locomotives, both the MR 1000 Class and the LMS Compound 4-4-0 as well. The Jubilees were a rather common sight on the Midland Main Line, the West Coast Main Line, and the Settle-Carlisle line, but were eventually displaced by the much more powerful Royal Scots during the 1940s.

The power classification was 5XP, in common with the earlier Patriot class. In January 1951 the classification was revised to 6P and in November 1955 to 6P5F but this change was not applied to the locomotives&#x27; cabsides, which continued to show 6P.

Five members of the class were fitted with a double chimney at different times. 5684 &quot;Jutland&quot; was the first, fitted with a double Kylchap in 1937. The double chimney did improve the power of the locos and also improved the coal consumption. It only carried this fitment for one year. 5742 &quot;Connaught&quot; was the next, being fitted with a plain double exhaust in 1940 which it carried until 1955. 5553 &quot;Canada&quot; was also fitted in 1940 but carried the double chimney for a short time. 5735 &quot;Comet&quot; and 5736 &quot;Phoenix&quot; were rebuilt with a 2A taper boiler and double chimney in 1942 to become the Rebuilt Jubilee Class. These two one-offs were have said to be a direct upgrade in performance in both power and steaming abilities from the non-rebuilt Jubilees, and similar in performance to the Rebuilt Patriot Class, however they were 3 tons heavier than the non-rebuilds, thus limiting their route availability. They were to have been the prototypes for the rebuilding of the entire class but were, in the end, the only Jubilees so to be treated. (They were reclassified 6P in July 1943, and 7P in 1951). As part of experiments at the Rugby Locomotive Testing Station, no. 45722 &quot;Defence&quot; was fitted with a double chimney from 1956 to 1957. In 1961 a double exhaust was fitted to no. 45596 &quot;Bahamas&quot; which carried it through withdrawal and into preservation.

===Construction===
Although built over only a three-year period the class had many variations due to improvements being made as they were built. The major differences were:
*Boilers – 10 variations, mainly affecting the number of tubes. The earlier boilers were domeless but later boilers were domed. There were two sizes of fire grate area depending on whether the firebox throatplate was straight or sloping.
*Bogies – Approximately 50 of the earlier locomotives were built with ex-Claughton bogies which had a 6 ft 3 in wheelbase compared to the later locomotives built with new bogies that had a wheelbase of 6 ft 6 in.
*Smokebox Saddle – The first 113 locomotives were built with a two piece saddle; the rest had a conventional one piece saddle.
*Tenders – Four basic patterns were fitted; Fowler 3,500 gallon. Fowler high-sided (10 off), Stanier 4,000 gallon and Stanier 3,500 gallon. These last tenders were difficult to identify, combining the high curved sides of the Stanier tender with the chassis from the earlier type Fowler tender. The easiest way to spot them is by the top row of horizontal rivets, slightly lower than on the 4,000 gallon version. However, taking into account rivets, wheelbase, and welds this can be subdivided into a total of eight patterns.

===Performance===
These locomotives had a bit of a mixed reception during their early working days, but while their reputation did improve over time, they didn&#x27;t reach the same amount of praise as the Black 5 locomotives. When the first members were built, the original 113 batch of engines to be precise, engine crews said that they were often disappointing. Crews often said that they were poor steamers and that the older locomotives that would be eventually replaced by them often performed better. However, once the problem with these engines was found and fixed after several extensive trials took place (the problem being that the diameter of the blast pipe was too large for the engines to make proper steam), the Jubilees went from being a theoretical success to an actual success thanks to some modifications.

===Withdrawal===
No. 45637 &quot;Windward Islands&quot; was destroyed in a severe accident in 1952, making it the first Jubilee engine to be scrapped. The remaining 188 locomotives were withdrawn between 1960 and 1967. The first of the standard withdrawals being 45609 &quot;Gilbert and Ellice Islands&quot; in September 1960 and the last engine to be withdrawn was No. 45562 &quot;Alberta&quot; from Leeds Holbeck shed (20A) on 4 November 1967. They were the last express engines from the Big Four days still in service.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 21 January 1938, locomotive No. 5568 &quot;Western Australia&quot; was hauling an express passenger train which was in a head-on collision with an empty stock train at Oakley Junction due to a combination of driver and signalman&#x27;s errors. Three people were killed and 46 were injured.
* On 11 October 1943, locomotive 5581 &quot;Bihar and Orissa&quot; hauling the Leeds - Edinburgh express collided with a freight train being shunted into sidings at Steeton, Yorkshire. No one was killed but four people were injured.
* On 18 May 1948, locomotives 5609 &quot;Gilbert and Ellice Islands&quot; (train loco) and 5605 &quot;Cyprus&quot; (pilot), hauling the 11:45 am down (St Pancras to Bradford) express were derailed, along with 8 coaches of a 12-coach train on a 30 ft high embankment near Wath Road Junction, Rotherham, Yorkshire. The cause was track distortion in hot weather. Poor track maintenance was a contributing factor. 8 people died and 56 were injured. Both locos were repaired at Derby Works and returned to service.
*On 8 October 1952, a three-train collision occurred at Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station, Middlesex. Locomotive No. 45637 &quot;Windward Islands&quot; was one of two locomotives hauling an express passenger train which crashed into wreckage. A total of 112 people were killed and 340 were injured. This remains the worst peacetime rail crash in the United Kingdom. The locomotive was consequently scrapped due to damage sustained.
*On 16 August 1953, locomotive No. 45699 &quot;Galatea&quot; was hauling a passenger train which became divided and was derailed at Kingsbury, Warwickshire due to a combination of defects on the locomotive and the condition of the track. 
*On 20 July 1959, locomotive No. 45730 &quot;Ocean&quot; overran a signal and consequently crashed into Dock Junction Signal Box, London. Trains had to be handsignalled into and out of station for several days afterwards.
*On 17 January 1964, No. 45695 &quot;Minotaur&quot; was involved in a head-on collision with a mail train and a freight train. The locomotive was deemed to be uneconomical to repair and was withdrawn and scrapped off-site.

== Preservation ==
Four Jubilees have been preserved, two each built by Crewe Works and by North British. 45593 and 45596 were purchased directly from BR for preservation. The other two were rescued from Woodham Brothers. All four have operated in preservation and all have run on the main line.

 two members of the class are operational and mainline certified: 45596 &quot;Bahamas&quot;, and 45699 &quot;Galatea&quot;. In May 2024 David Smith of West Coast Railways confirmed that he had purchased 45593 &quot;Kolhapur&quot; and that the locomotive was moving to Carnforth for overhaul at a future date, while 45690 &quot;Leander&quot; was about to undertake an overhaul.

A large number of parts were taken from sister engine 45562 &quot;Alberta&quot;, which was the subject matter of a few preservation attempts, one of them even tried to persuade Sir Billy Butlin to buy it, that failed before she was scrapped in 1968 and most parts exist on preserved sister engine &quot;Galatea&quot;.

Note: Marked names indicate that the loco is not presently wearing them. Loco numbers in bold mean their current number.

==Model railways==
Mainline Railways&#x27; catalogue included OO gauge LMS Jubilees with Fowler tenders in 1983; in LMS crimson, BR green and BR lined black liveries. Mainline also had a limited availability of other OO gauge Jubilee 5XPs the same year; an LMS crimson model of &quot;Leander&quot; and a BR green model of &quot;Orion&quot;. In early 2008, Bachmann introduced a OO gauge model of 45611 &quot;Hong Kong&quot; in BR green livery. Graham Farish have produced various British N gauge Jubilee models, including (in 2013) 5664 &quot;Nelson&quot; in LMS crimson and 45572 &quot;Eire&quot; in British Railways lined green with late crest.

<doc id="569218" wikidata="Q1489004" url="?curid=569218" title="Philip Zelikow">
<text>Philip David Zelikow (; born 21 September 1954) is an American diplomat and international relations scholar.

He has worked as the executive director of the 9/11 Commission, director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia, and counselor of the United States Department of State.

He is the Botha-Chan Senior Fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution after serving for 25 years as the White Burkett Miller Professor of History at the University of Virginia. In the fall of 2009 he was American Academy in Berlin Axel Springer Fellow.

== Education ==
Zelikow received a BA in history and political science from the University of Redlands, a JD from the University of Houston Law Center (where he was an editor of the law review), and a MALD and PhD in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.

==Career==
=== Academic and federal government positions ===
After practicing law in the early 1980s, Zelikow turned toward the field of national security. He was adjunct professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California in 1984–1985.

He joined the United States Department of State through the standard examination process for the foreign service as a career civil servant. As a foreign service officer, he served overseas at the U.S. mission to the conventional arms control talks in Vienna, at the State Department&#x27;s 24-hour crisis center, and on the secretariat staff for Secretary of State George P. Shultz, during the second Reagan administration (1985–1989).

In 1989, in the George H. W. Bush administration, Zelikow was detailed to the National Security Council, where he was involved as a senior White House staffer in the diplomacy surrounding the German reunification and the diplomatic settlements accompanying the end of the Cold War in Europe. During the first Gulf War, he aided President Bush, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, and Secretary of State James Baker in diplomatic affairs related to the coalition. He co-authored, with Condoleezza Rice, the book &quot;Germany Unified and Europe Transformed: A Study in Statecraft&quot; (1995), an academic study of the politics of reunification.

In 1991, Zelikow left the NSC to go to Harvard University. From 1991 to 1998, he was associate professor of Public Policy and co-director of Harvard&#x27;s Intelligence and Policy Program, at Harvard Kennedy School.

In 1998, Zelikow moved to the University of Virginia, where until February 2005 he directed the nation&#x27;s largest center on the American presidency. He served as director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs and, as White Burkett Miller Professor of History, held an endowed chair. The center launched a project to transcribe and annotate the previously secret tapes made during the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon presidencies. In a presidential oral history project headed by James Sterling Young, it systematically gathers additional information on the presidencies of Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton.

In November 1998, Zelikow co-authored, &quot;Catastrophic Terrorism: Tackling the New Danger&quot; for &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine. He wrote, &quot;Like Pearl Harbor, the event would divide our future into a before and after. The United States might respond with draconian measures scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects, and the use of deadly force. More violence could follow either future terrorist attacks or U.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently.&quot;

In September 2002, a year after 9/11, Zelikow authored, &quot;The National Security Strategy of The United States of America&quot;. Though some have alleged that Zelikow therefore outlined the U.S. pre-emptive war doctrine that 6 months later would be used against Iraq, in fact Zelikow had objected to this language and this part of the drafting was done by others.

In January 2003, Zelikow was appointed executive director of the 9/11 Commission.
Following an appointment at the Department of State from 2005 to 2007 during the Bush administration, Zelikow returned to academics at the University of Virginia. In 2011, he was appointed Associate Dean of the Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences. He has been instrumental in restructuring the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. Also in 2011, Zelikow was appointed by President Barack Obama to the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board.

=== Commissions and committees ===
====Bush transition team====
In late 2000 and early 2001, Zelikow served on President Bush&#x27;s transition team. After George W. Bush took office, Zelikow was named to a position on the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board [PFIAB], and worked on other task forces and commissions as well. He directed the bipartisan National Commission on Federal Election Reform, created after the 2000 election and chaired by former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, along with Lloyd Cutler and Bob Michel. This commission&#x27;s recommendations led directly to congressional consideration and enactment into law of the Help America Vote Act of 2002.

====Markle Task Force on Security====
In 2002, Zelikow became the executive director of the Markle Task Force on National Security in the Information Age. The Task Force comprises a diverse and bipartisan group of experienced policymakers, senior executives from the information technology industry, public interest advocates, and experts in privacy, intelligence, and national security. The Markle Task Force seeks to inform the policy judgments and investments of the federal, state and local governments in the collection and use of information as it relates to national security. The Task Force&#x27;s reports and recommendations have been codified through two laws (IRPTA 2004 and the Implementing 9/11 Commission Report Act 2007) and several presidential directives.

====Executive director of the 9/11 Commission====
Zelikow was appointed executive director of the 9/11 Commission (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States), whose work included examination of the conduct of presidents Clinton and George W. Bush and their administrations prior to and on September 11, 2001. Zelikow&#x27;s prior involvement with the administration of George W. Bush led to opposition from the 9/11 Family Steering Committee, citing the obvious conflict of interest of having previously worked on the Bush transition team. The commission&#x27;s Republican chair and Democratic vice-chair strongly defended Zelikow, both at the time and later.

In response to the concerns, Zelikow had agreed to recuse himself from any investigation matters pertaining to the National Security Council&#x27;s transition from the Clinton to Bush administrations, which Zelikow had helped manage.

Zelikow&#x27;s work on the commission was attacked by some on both the right and the left. From the right, Zelikow was blamed for the commission&#x27;s finding that Iraq had not been behind the 9/11 attacks. From the other side, a book attacking Zelikow&#x27;s work quoted anonymous staff members of the 9/11 Commission as having distrusted Zelikow, considering him to be a &quot;White House mole&quot; in view of his being a close confidant of National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and his having worked in several high level capacities in the George W. Bush administration. Outraged by this attack, both commissioners and staff rallied publicly to defend Zelikow&#x27;s management of the staff and the integrity of the report. The much-acclaimed report was a finalist for the National Book Award.

====Rice national security strategy project====
In &quot;Rise of the Vulcans&quot; (2004), James Mann reports that when Richard Haass, a senior aide to Secretary of State Colin Powell and the director of policy planning at the State Department, drafted an overview of America&#x27;s national security strategy following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Dr. Rice, the national security advisor, &quot;ordered that the document be completely rewritten. She thought the Bush administration needed something bolder, something that would represent a more dramatic break with the ideas of the past. Rice turned the writing over to her old colleague, University of Virginia Professor Philip Zelikow.&quot; One criticism of this document, issued on September 17, 2002, is that it is supposed to have been a significant document in an alleged Bush administration doctrine of preemptive war. However, in the drafting of this document Zelikow had opposed the proposed language using preemption in the context of how to deal with weapons of mass destruction.

====Rework America====
In 2014–15, while on leave from the University of Virginia and working for the Markle Foundation, Zelikow helped lead a Foundation-sponsored group of prominent Americans called &quot;Rework America.&quot; The group developed arguments and ideas on how to use the digital revolution to enlarge economic opportunity for all Americans. The group published its ideas in &quot;America&#x27;s Moment: Creating Opportunity in the Connected Age.&quot;

===George W. Bush administration===
Zelikow&#x27;s role in the second Iraq war is discussed at some length in Bob Woodward&#x27;s &quot;State of Denial&quot;, which presents him as an internal critic of the way the war was being conducted in 2005 and 2006, and as an originator of the alternative approach termed &quot;clear, hold, and build.&quot; He is named by sources such as Jack Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Terror Presidency&quot; as an internal critic of the treatment of terrorist captives, and there was wide attention given to an address he made on this subject after leaving office in April 2007.

Based on speeches and internal memos, some political analysts believe that Zelikow disagreed with aspects of the Bush administration&#x27;s Middle Eastern policy.

As Counselor to Secretary of State Rice, Zelikow opposed the Bush administration Torture Memos. In 2006, Zelikow wrote a memorandum warning that the abuse of prisoners through so-called &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; could constitute war crimes. Bush administration officials ignored his recommendations, and tried to collect all copies of the memo and destroy them. Jane Mayer, author of &quot;The Dark Side&quot;, quotes Zelikow as predicting that &quot;America&#x27;s descent into torture will in time be viewed like the Japanese internments&quot;, in that &quot;(f)ear and anxiety were exploited by zealots and fools.&quot;

===Expertise===
Zelikow&#x27;s area of academic expertise is the history and practice of public policy. In addition to the work on German unification, he has been significantly involved in contemporary scholarship on the Cuban Missile Crisis, including the relation between this crisis and the east–west confrontation over Berlin.

While at Harvard, he worked with Ernest R. May and Richard Neustadt on the use, and misuse, of history in policymaking. They observed, as Zelikow noted in his own words, that &quot;contemporary&quot; history is &quot;defined functionally by those critical people and events that go into forming the public&#x27;s presumptions about its immediate past. The idea of &#x27;public presumption&#x27;,&quot; he explained, &quot;is akin to William McNeill&#x27;s notion of &#x27;public myth&#x27; but without the negative implication sometimes invoked by the word &#x27;myth.&#x27; Such presumptions are beliefs (1) thought to be true (although not necessarily known to be true with certainty), and (2) shared in common within the relevant political community.&quot;

Zelikow and May also authored and sponsored scholarship on the relationship between intelligence analysis and policy decisions. Zelikow later helped found a research project to prepare and publish annotated transcripts of presidential recordings made secretly during the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations (see WhiteHouseTapes.org) and another project to strengthen oral history work on more recent administrations, with both these projects based at the University of Virginia&#x27;s Miller Center of Public Affairs.

In writing about the importance of beliefs about history, Zelikow has called attention to what he has called &quot;&#x27;searing&#x27; or &#x27;molding&#x27; events [that] take on &#x27;transcendent&#x27; importance and, therefore, retain their power even as the experiencing generation passes from the scene. In the United States, beliefs about the formation of the nation and the Constitution remain powerful today, as do beliefs about slavery and the Civil War. World War II, Vietnam, and the civil rights struggle are more recent examples.&quot; He has noted that &quot;a history’s narrative power is typically linked to how readers relate to the actions of individuals in the history; if readers cannot make a connection to their own lives, then a history may fail to engage them at all.&quot;

In 2020, Zelikow, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

====Terrorism====
Zelikow has also written about terrorism and national security, including a set of Harvard case studies on &quot;Policing Northern Ireland.&quot; In the November–December 1998 issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, he co-authored an article Catastrophic Terrorism, with Ashton B. Carter, and John M. Deutch, in which they speculated that if the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center had succeeded, &quot;the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to describe it. Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event in American history. It could involve loss of life and property unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America’s fundamental sense of security, as did the Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. Like Pearl Harbor, the event would divide our past and future into a before and after. The United States might respond with draconian measures scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects and use of deadly force. More violence could follow, either future terrorist attacks or U.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently.&quot;

====Peace in World War I====

From the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until January 1917, US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s primary goal was using American neutrality to broker a peace conference that would end the war. In the first two years neither side was interested in negotiations. However, that changed in late 1916 when, Zelikow argues, both sides were ready for peace negotiations, if Wilson would be the broker. However, Wilson waited too long, failed to realize the importance of his financial power over Britain, and put mistaken reliance on Colonel House and Secretary of State Robert Lansing, who undermined his proposals by encouraging Britain to stall. Zelikow emphasizes that German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg was seriously interested in peace, but he had to fend off the demands of Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff who were taking dictatorial control of Germany. Zelikow argues that when Wilson finally did make his peace proposal in January 1917, it was too little and too late, and instead of peace the war escalated. Hindenburg and Ludendorff had convinced the Kaiser that victory was at hand by using unrestricted submarine warfare, and moving troops in from the Russian front to smash the French and British front lines.

In practical politics, &quot;Saying &quot;what&quot; to do is the easy part. Designing &quot;how&quot; to do it is the hard part. [Italics added.] ... The &#x27;how&#x27; is the &#x27;craft&#x27; in statecraft. Most of what the U.S. government does is distributing money and set[ting] rules. Relatively few parts of [the government] mount policy operations, especially diplomatic ones. Doing so requires complex teamwork... The limited supply of effective U.S. policymaking was demonstrated tragically during the COVID-19 outbreak, when the world failed to create a global alliance to fight a global pandemic.&quot; (p. 57.) &quot;Judged by its human and economic toll, the COVID-19 pandemic was a global war. More than 20 million people died... [T]he so-called pandemic playbook [that had earlier been] prepared by the Obama administration did not actually diagram any plays. There was no &#x27;how.&#x27;&quot; (p. 64.)

<text>The Fiordland penguin (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus), also known as the Fiordland crested penguin (in Māori, tawaki or pokotiwha), is a crested penguin species endemic to New Zealand. It currently breeds along the south-western coasts of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island as well as on Stewart Island/Rakiura and its outlying islands. Because it originally ranged beyond Fiordland, it is sometimes referred to as the New Zealand crested penguin. It is occasionally found in Australia.

== Taxonomy ==
The Fiordland crested penguin was described in 1845 by English zoologist George Robert Gray, its specific epithet derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;pachy-&quot;/παχυ- &quot;thick&quot; and &quot;rhynchos&quot;/ρύγχος &quot;beak&quot;. It is one of the four to seven species in the genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot;, the generic name derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;eu&quot;/ευ &quot;good&quot; and &quot;dyptes&quot;/δύπτης &quot;diver&quot;.

== Description ==

This species is a medium-sized, yellow-crested, black-and-white penguin, growing to approximately long and weighing on average , with a weight range of . The face possesses white markings and the front is white while the head and body are black. Its broad, yellow crest begins at the base of the beak and extends over the eye, dropping down the neck. It can be distinguished from the similar erect-crested penguin (&quot;Eudyptes sclateri&quot;) and Snares penguin (&quot;Eudyptes robustus&quot;) in having no bare skin around the base of its bill. Female Fiordland penguins lay a clutch of two eggs where the first-laid egg is much smaller than the second egg, generally hatches later, and shows higher mortality, demonstrating a brood reduction system that is unique from other avian groups. The Fiordland crested penguin has a much higher breeding success than most other Eudyptes species except for the southern rockhopper penguin, even at sites with introduced and/or native predators.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This penguin nests in colonies among tree roots and rocks in dense temperate coastal forest. It breeds along the shores in the West Coast of the South Island, south of about Bruce Bay and the Open Bay Islands, around Fiordland and Foveaux Strait, and on Stewart Island/Rakiura and its outlying islands. Fossils of this species have been found as far north as the northern end of the South Island, and they probably once nested in the North Island as well. Their range drastically reduced by hunting in Polynesian times, and they are now only found in the least-populated part of New Zealand. The species was also present in Australia.

== Behaviour ==

=== Diet ===
The main prey species reported are cephalopods (85%, mainly arrow squid, &quot;Nototodarus sloanii&quot;), followed by crustaceans (13%, primarily krill, &quot;Nyctiphanes australis&quot;) and fish (2%, mainly red cod and Blue grenadier (hoki)). However, the importance of cephalopods might be exaggerated. Prey taken seems to vary between Codfish Island and northern Fiordland.

=== Foraging ecology ===
&quot;Eudyptes pachyrhyncus&quot; are split into three groups based on their location in the fjord and where they hunt, dubbed the inner-fjord, mid-fjord and outer-fjord. Outer-fjord &quot;Eudyptes pachyrhynchus&quot; make long, deep dives with descent velocities reaching higher points than that of mid-fjord individuals who forage in the upper 20 meters of the water column.In isolated populations of the species patterns in autochthonous food sources and subsidies from allochthonous resources impact the population and locally produced resources are of great importance to each and every colony.

=== Predators and avoidance ===
When researching the &quot;Eudyptes pachyrhynchus&quot; nest searches may cause temporary abandonment leaving opportunities for predation when the searched are done in the first half of the incubation period. Domestic dogs prove to be great threats to the species with conservation campaigns encouraging dogs to be leashed at all times near habitats that &quot;Eudyptes pachyrhynchus&quot; occupies in order to aid the threatened population. 

=== Reproductive and incubation habits ===
Reproductive and incubation habits of Fiordland crested penguins (&quot;Eudyptes pachyrhynchus&quot;) are not heavily researched however they provide an important view of the life cycles and reproductive success rates. Reproductive behaviours alter both feeding habits and intraspecies interactions due to courting behaviours and protective strategies employed by the parents of the chicks. Except for during the reproductive and incubatory periods Fiordland crested penguins tend to travel alone and are nocturnal creatures during their entire life. 

Considered sexually mature at around 5 to 6 years post birth &quot;Eudyptes pachyrhynchus&quot; proceed to participate in their first breeding cycle. After 4 months at sea breeding birds form small groups at the height of winter and breed annually from July to December coming ashore for around 20 weeks before the chick leaves. The breeding period coincides with the greatest food availability in order to support energy needs of reproductive behaviours and reproduction. Display behaviours involve attitudes where the flippers and crests are prominent as well as loud vocalizations. Display vocalizations include a series of loud barks and braying sounds unlike the short high bark used for a contact call. Levels of oestradiol and testosterone in females and males respectively increase during courtship and decline to low level by the time eggs are laid however progesterone though highest during courtship remained at high levels post egg laying and incubation. Each clutch features two eggs with the second being larger.

Eudyptes pachyrhynchus nest in small scattered groups across steep slopes covered by rainforests that protect them from extreme temperatures and on open coast sites such as Jackson Head. Fidelity to an egg site assists the reproductive success with no significant difference in nest fidelity between sexes. Though viewed as a monogamous group, failure to raise a chick can result in increased separation rates. The incubation period lasts for 31–36 days and both parents take long shifts with the male guardian for three weeks while the female feeds the hatchling near daily. A failed reproductive cycle increases the likelihood of a male to return to a previous nest site decreasing their likelihood of mate fidelity however they still have greater rates of fidelity than other penguins in the same group. Heavy rainfall and frequent storms play a large role in loss of offspring while if both eggs are hatched the larger one is favoured leading to increased mortality rates of the smaller penguins due to starvation.

First laid eggs of Eudyptes penguins tend to possess features for a brood reduction system despite a lack of association with aggressive behavior or nest crowding the first eggs continue to experience a greater rate of mortality than second eggs. Most deaths occurred in the laying period rather and those that were laid first hatched at a later date than the second laid egg with the first despite being hatched later being smaller than the second laid egg. Once the chick is ready to join a crèche at around 21 to 28 days old it is fed by both parents until it leaves for the sea at around 75 days old with the parents following behind shortly. Adults molt once a year often in their nest after 60 to 80 days at sea and fast for around 25 days before the new plumage is grown enough to return to feeding. During the fasting period of egg formation the amount of nutrients transferred to eggs was decreased in comparison to the amount of body reserves with the interval between yolk completion and laying being 4 to 9 days with the first yolk growing for several days before the second yolk began the growth process. During chick rearing the &quot;Eudyptes pachyrhynchus&quot; penguins shift to central-place foraging strategies as they depend on reliable access to prey while avoiding straying too far from suitable nesting habitats. 

When in captivity and exposed to concerts such as in Melbourne zoo time spent preening and interacting with their habitats was decreased in favour of spending time in the pool or using a nest. Post breeding period &quot;Eudyptes pachyrhynchus&quot; head south-west before splitting towards one of two trip destinations with those leaving in late November going towards the subtropical front and those leaving in December heading towards the sub-Antarctic front. Sub-Antarctic front traveling individuals were most impacted by factors due to the sea level, the surface current and the water depth while those traveling to the subtropical front were more impacted by the sea surface temperature and the concentration of chlorophyll a.

== Conservation ==
Fiordland crested penguins are classed as near threatened by the IUCN, and their status was changed from vulnerable to endangered by the Department of Conservation in 2013. Surveys in the 1990s counted 2,500 pairs, though this was likely an underestimate; based on historic trends, the population is probably continuing to decline. The main threats are introduced predators such dogs, cats, rats, and especially stoats. They are also vulnerable to human disturbance, fleeing nests and leaving chicks exposed to predators.

<text>Beowawe ( ) is a small town in Eureka County, Nevada, United States.

==Description==
The community is the site of a mining operation and a geothermal power plant, and has a public library. &quot;Beowawe&quot; is a Paiute Native American word meaning &quot;gate&quot;, so named for the peculiar shape of the hills close to town which gives the effect of a gateway opening to the valley beyond. The town is located at an elevation of , and is situated on State Route 306 south of Interstate 80. The Humboldt River runs through northern Nevada near Beowawe. At approximately long, it is the second longest river in the arid Great Basin of North America. It has no outlet to the ocean, but instead empties into the Humboldt Sink.

==History==
Beowawe was founded in 1868 with the arrival of the railroad. Gravelly Ford, a noted site on the California Trail, is about six miles east of Beowawe on Pioneer Pass Road. The famous &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Grave&quot; marker overlooks the ford. A tall cross in the Beowawe cemetery commemorates the burial of Lucinda Duncan, a grandmother who died on the trail in 1863. Workers building the Central Pacific Railroad first noted the grave along the Humboldt River, and in 1906, it was moved to the hillside cemetery when the Union Pacific realigned its tracks. The town reached its peak around 1881 with a population of 60 people. It consisted of an elementary school, church, post office, store, and library. In 1909, a power plant was built but, like many ghost towns, the boom had ended by 1916 and many of the residents had moved on. Currently, Beowawe is once again tied to energy production, the home to both a geothermal power plant and a large propane tank farm near the railroad.

==Geothermal system at Beowawe==
The surface expression of the geothermal system consists of a &quot;, opaline sinter terrace produced by hot spring and natural geyser (sic fumarole) activity along the base of the Malpais Rim. Since 1959, several companies have tested the potential of the area as a source of steam for electrical power generation. The spectacular hot water and steam plume that are present at(1985/1986) vents continuously along the top of the sinter terrace is not a natural geyser, but is a free-flowing, uncapped geothermal well.&quot; (Struhsacker, 1986, p. 111).

Photos of hot springs and fumaroles – photos &#x27;9-67&#x27; (1931) and &#x27;9-56&#x27; (date unknown) – show hydrothermal activity prior to power-generation. It is unknown if those smaller hydrothermal surface features are still active as of 2015, post-power plant development; field reconnaissance would be required to assess the activity of the hydrothermal features. Photos &#x27;9-69&#x27; (close-up, date unknown) and &#x27;9-108&#x27; (distant, 1971) show the uncapped well that is not a natural geyser, which was active prior to power-production. Geyser activity at the wellhead ceased circa 1985/1986 as the local dual-flash geothermal power plant began operations.

The man-made geyser at Beowawe in central Nevada is similar to Fly Geyser in northwestern Nevada in that both were artificially produced by geothermal drilling, but the former area was developed for clean energy production and the latter area was not. Another striking difference between the localities is an aesthetic one: more travertine has precipitated from the hydrothermal fluids at Fly Geyser than at Beowawe, generating spectacular mounds at Fly Geyser&#x27;s uncapped wellhead, thus suggesting dissimilar water chemistry between the two geothermal systems.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Beowawe has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen type BSk).

<text>The Rolls-Royce Pegasus is a British turbofan engine originally designed by Bristol Siddeley. It was manufactured by Rolls-Royce plc. The engine is not only able to power a jet aircraft forward, but also to direct thrust downwards via swivelling nozzles. Lightly loaded aircraft equipped with this engine can manoeuvre like a helicopter. In particular, they can perform vertical takeoffs and landings. In US service, the engine is designated F402.

Originally the Bristol Siddeley Pegasus, the engine powers all versions of the Harrier family of multi-role military aircraft. Rolls-Royce licensed Pratt &amp; Whitney to build the Pegasus for US built versions. However Pratt &amp; Whitney never completed any engines, with all new build being manufactured by Rolls-Royce in Bristol, England. The Pegasus was also the planned engine for a number of aircraft projects, among which were the prototypes of the German Dornier Do 31 VSTOL military transport project.

==Development==

===Background===

Michel Wibault, the French aircraft designer, had the idea to use vectored thrust for vertical take-off aircraft. This thrust would come from four centrifugal blowers shaft driven by a Bristol Orion turboprop, the exhaust from each blower being vectored by rotating the blower scrolls. Although the idea of vectoring the thrust was quite novel, the engine proposed was considered to be far too heavy.

As a result, an engineer at Bristol Engine Company, Gordon Lewis, began in 1956 to study alternative engine concepts, using, where possible, existing engine components from the Orpheus and Olympus engine series. The work was overseen by the Technical Director Stanley Hooker. One concept which looked promising was the BE52, which initially used the Orpheus 3 as the engine core and, on a separate coaxial shaft, the first two stages of an Olympus 21 LP compressor, which acted as a fan, delivering compressed air to two thrust vectoring nozzles at the front of engine. At this point in the design exercise, the exhaust from the LP turbine discharged through a conventional rear nozzle. There were separate intakes for the fan and core compressor because the fan did not supercharge the core compressor.

Although the BE.52 was a self-contained power plant and lighter than Wibault&#x27;s concept, the BE.52 was still complicated and heavy. As a result, work on the BE.53 concept started in February 1957. In the BE.53 the Olympus stages were fitted close to the Orpheus stages; thus simplifying the inlet ducting. The Olympus stages now supercharged the Orpheus core, improving the overall pressure ratio, creating what is now considered a conventional turbofan configuration.

For a year Bristol designed the engine in isolation, with little feedback from the various airframe manufacturers furnished with data. However, in May 1957 the team received a supportive letter from Sydney Camm of Hawker Aviation stating they were looking for a Hawker Hunter replacement. The aircraft designer, Ralph Hooper, suggested having the four thrust vectoring nozzles (originally suggested by Lewis), with hot gases from the rear two. Further joint discussions helped to refine the engine design.

The 1957 Defence White Paper, which focused on missiles, and not crewed aircraft – which were declared &#x27;obsolete&#x27; - was not good news, because it precluded any future government financial support for development of not already extant crewed combat aircraft. This prevented any official financial support for the engine or aircraft from the Ministry of Defence. Fortunately, engine development was financially supported to the tune of 75% from the Mutual Weapons Development Program, Verdon Smith of Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited (BSEL), which Bristol Engines had by then become on its merger with Armstrong Siddeley, quickly agreeing to pay the remainder.

The first prototype engine (one of two BE53/2s built), ran on 2 September 1959 and featured a 2-stage fan and used the Orpheus 6 core. Although the fan was overhung, inlet guide vanes were still incorporated. 
The HP spool comprised a 7-stage compressor driven by a single-stage turbine. A 2-stage LP turbine drove the fan. There was no plenum at fan exit, but 4 thrust-vectoring nozzles were fitted.

Further development of the engine then proceeded in tandem with the aircraft, the Hawker P.1127. The aircraft first flew (tethered hover) on 21 October 1960, powered by the BE53/3 (Pegasus 2). 
Free hover was achieved on 19 November of the same year. Transition to wing-borne flight occurred in 1961. Later versions of the P.1127 were fitted with the Pegasus 3 and eventually the Pegasus 5.

The Pegasus 5 was also used in the Kestrel, a refinement of the P.1127, of which nine were built for a Tripartite evaluation exercise. The Kestrel was subsequently developed into the Harrier combat aircraft. By the time the Pegasus 5/2 was built, both the fan and HP compressor had been zero-staged and 2nd stage added to the HP turbine.

===Testing and production===

The flight testing and engine development received no government funding; the plane&#x27;s funding came entirely from Hawker.

The first engines had barely enough thrust to lift the plane off the ground due to weight growth problems. Flight tests were initially conducted with the aircraft tethered, with the first free hover achieved on 19 November 1960. The first transition from static hover to conventional flight was achieved on 8 September 1961. It was originally feared that the aircraft would have difficulty transitioning between level and vertical flight, but during testing it was found to be extremely simple. Testing showed that because of the extreme power-to-weight ratio it only took a few degrees of nozzle movement to get the aircraft moving forward quickly enough to produce lift from the wing, and that even at a 15-degree angle the aircraft accelerated very well. The pilot simply had to move the nozzle control forward slowly. During transition from horizontal back to vertical the pilot would simply slow to roughly 200 knots and turn the nozzles downward, allowing the engine thrust to take over as the aircraft slowed and the wings stopped producing lift.

The RAF was not much of a convert to the VTOL idea, and described the whole project as a &quot;toy&quot; and a &quot;crowd pleaser&quot;. The first prototype P1127 made a very heavy landing at the Paris Air Show in 1963.

Series manufacture and design and development improvement to the Pegasus to produce ever-higher thrusts were continued by Bristol engines beyond 1966, when Rolls-Royce Ltd bought the Company. A related engine design, the 39,500 lbf (with reheat) Bristol Siddeley BS100 for a supersonic VTOL fighter (the Hawker Siddeley P.1154) was not developed to production as the aircraft project was cancelled in 1965.

A non-vectored 26,000 lb thrust derivative of the Pegasus running on liquid hydrogen, the RB.420, was designed and offered in 1970 in response to a NASA requirement for an engine to power the projected Space Shuttle on its return flight through the atmosphere. In the event, NASA chose a shuttle design using a non-powered gliding return.
==Design==

The Pegasus vectored-thrust turbofan is a two-shaft design with three low pressure (LP) and eight high pressure (HP) compressor stages driven by two LP and two HP turbine stages respectively. It is the first turbofan to have the fan ahead of the LP shaft front bearing. This eliminated the requirement for bearing-support struts in front of the fan and the icing hazard that goes with them. Unusually the LP and HP spools rotate in opposite directions which significantly reduces the gyroscopic effects which would otherwise cause aircraft control problems at low aircraft speeds. LP and HP blades are made from titanium. The fan is a transonic design and airflow is 432 lb/s. The engine employs a simple thrust vectoring system that uses four swiveling nozzles, giving the Harrier thrust both for lift and forward propulsion, allowing for STOVL flight.

Combustion system is an annular combustor with ASM low-pressure vaporising burners.

Engine starting was by a top-mounted packaged combined gas turbine starter/APU.

===Nozzles===

The front nozzles, which are made of steel, are fed with air from the LP compressor, and the rear nozzles, which are of Nimonic with hot (650 °C) jet exhaust. The airflow split is about 60/40 front/back. The nozzles are rotated using motorcycle chains driven by air motors powered by air from the HP compressor. The nozzles rotate through a range of 98.5 degrees.

===Position of the engine===
The engine is mounted in the centre of the Harrier and as a result, it was necessary to remove the wing to change the powerplant after mounting the fuselage on trestles. The change took a minimum of eight hours, although using the proper tools and lifting equipment this could be accomplished in less than four.

===Water injection===

The maximum take-off thrust available from the Pegasus engine is limited, particularly at the higher ambient temperatures, by the turbine blade temperature. As this temperature cannot reliably be measured, the operating limits are determined by jet pipe temperature. To enable the engine speed and hence thrust to be increased for take-off, water is sprayed into the combustion chamber and turbine to keep the blade temperature down to an acceptable level.

Water for the injection system is contained in a tank located between the bifurcated section of the rear (hot) exhaust duct. The tank contains up to 500 lb (227 kg, 50 imperial gallons) of distilled water. Water flow rate for the required turbine temperature reduction is approximately 35gpm (imperial gallons per minute) for a maximum duration of approximately 90 seconds. The quantity of water carried is sufficient for and appropriate to the particular operational role of the aircraft.

Selection of water injection engine ratings (Lift Wet/Short Lift Wet) results in an increase in the engine speed and jet pipe temperature limits beyond the respective dry (non-injected) ratings (Lift Dry/Short Lift Dry). Upon exhausting the available water supply in the tank, the limits are reset to the &#x27;dry&#x27; levels. A warning light in the cockpit provides advance warning of water depletion to the pilot.

Depending on time constraints and water injection, between (max. continuous at 91% RPM) and (15 s wet at 107% RPM) of lift is available at sea level (including splay loss at 90°). The Mk.106 development was produced for the Sea Harrier FA2 upgrade and generates .
; Pegasus 11-61 (Mk.107): The 11-61 (aka -408) is the latest and most powerful version of the Pegasus, providing . This equates to up to 15 percent more thrust at high ambient temperatures, allowing upgraded Harriers to return to an aircraft carrier without having to dump any unused weapons which along with the reduced maintenance reduces total cost of engine use. This latest Pegasus is also fitted to the AV-8B+. The RAF/RN was in the process of upgrading its GR7 fleet to GR9 standard, initially through the Joint Upgrade and Maintenance Programme (JUMP) and then through the Harrier Platform Availability Contract (HPAC). All GR7 aircraft were expected to have been upgraded by April 2010. Part of this process was the upgrade of the Mk.105 engines to Mk.107 standard. These aircraft were known as GR7As and GR9As.

<text>Eismitte, also called Mid-Ice in English, was a meteorological station established, in the middle of the Greenland Ice Sheet, by the 1930-31 German Greenland Expedition. The venture took place from July 1930 until August 1931, and established three Arctic stations on the same parallel. The expedition leader, German scientist Alfred Wegener, died during a trip back from Eismitte, in early November 1930. The station was abandoned on 1 August 1931.

The name &quot;Eismitte&quot; means &quot;Ice-Middle&quot; in German, and the campsite was located from the coast at an estimated altitude of . The coldest temperature recorded at the site was on 20 March 1931, while the warmest temperature noted was on 9 July 1931. For the 12-month period beginning 1 August 1930 and ending 5 August 1931, the warmest month, July, had a mean monthly temperature of . while the coldest month, February, averaged . Over the same period a total of of water-equivalent precipitation was recorded, with most of it being received in Winter. At the latitude of the camp, the sun does not set between 13 May and 30 July each year, and does not rise between 23 November and 20 January.

==Wintering==
Ernst Sorge was a member of Alfred Wegener&#x27;s expedition. Together with Johannes Georgi he stayed in Eismitte from July 1930 to August 1931. Fritz Loewe stayed from October 1930 to May 1931. Sorge hand-dug a 15 m deep pit adjacent to his subterranean snow cave, which served as living quarters during the seven-month-long overwintering. Sorge systematically and quantitatively studied the near-surface snow/firn strata from inside his pit. After examination of the structural features and measurement of continuous density and other physical properties within the pit profile, he determined the characteristics of the individual limits of annual snow accumulation. This research validated the feasibility of measuring the preserved annual snow accumulation cycles, like measuring frozen precipitation in a rain gauge.

==Climate==
Eismitte is one of the coldest locations in the Northern Hemisphere, with an annual mean temperature of having been recorded during the period of the expedition that established it. Eismitte has a polar ice cap climate. The weather station was run for approximately one year; the weather record thus is very sparse. The Summit Camp station slightly to the north has a similar climate with a much longer period of record.

<doc id="569241" wikidata="Q4424499" url="?curid=569241" title="The Confusion">
<text>The Confusion is a novel by Neal Stephenson. It is the second volume in &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; and consists of two sections or books, &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;The Juncto&quot;. In 2005, &quot;The Confusion&quot; won the Locus Award, together with &quot;The System of the World&quot;, also by Stephenson.

==Background==
Like the other volumes in the series, &quot;Confusion&quot; was written as multiple novels. However, unlike in the other two volumes of the Series, the two novels are set in concurrent periods. In the publication of the two novels as a single volume, Stephenson chose to publish the volume as alternating sections between &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;The Juncto&quot;, book 4 and 5 respectively.

==Plot==
Though the first publication of the Series in three volumes combined the two novels &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;The Juncto&quot;, here the plots will be dealt with as separate entities, true to the author&#x27;s original intention.

===Bonanza===

The beginning of &quot;Bonanza&quot; finds Jack Shaftoe awakened from a syphilitic blackout of nearly three years. During this time he was a pirate galley slave. The other members of his bench, a motley crew who call themselves &quot;The Cabal&quot; and who include men from Africa, the Far East and Europe, create a plot to capture silver illegally shipped from Central America by a Spanish Viceroy; they convince the Pasha of Algiers and their owner to sponsor this endeavor and negotiate for their freedom and a cut in the profit. They capture the ship, but upon boarding it, they find it full, not of silver as they had expected, but of gold. Fleeing the Spanish they are followed by a frigate in the employ of the duc d&#x27;Arcachon, an investor in their plan and a man who wishes to kill Jack for ruining a party in &quot;The King of the Vagabonds&quot;. Believing the Duke plans to cheat the Cabal in the investment, they sail to Egypt and transport the gold over land to Cairo.

In Cairo the Cabal negotiates with d&#x27;Arcachon&#x27;s men for a meeting with the duc himself; as an inducement for this meeting they offer to hand over Jack. Jack cuts off the head of the duc to avenge Eliza, whom the duc had enslaved over a decade earlier. Fighting ensues between the Cabal and d&#x27;Arcachon&#x27;s musketeers. The Cabal manages to escape (short several of its members and a good portion of the gold), fleeing toward Mocha. Realizing that they are no longer welcome in any European port, they carry the gold to India, where they are captured by a pirate queen who takes the gold. The Cabal is left penniless and its members are dispersed. Some are recruited in the army of a local king. Jack ends up working in an animal hospital in Ahmedabad.

A year later, Jack reunites with a few members of the Cabal and conceives a plan to carry goods through a route that no traders can use because it is controlled by armies of plunderers. Jack shows the Cabal how to produce phosphorus from urine, and they use it to fight their way through. For this role in opening up the trade route, Jack is rewarded with a temporary, three-year kingship over an impoverished part of India. During his reign, Jack directs the construction of a ship made of durable teak wood, using funds invested by the pirate queen who had seized the Cabal&#x27;s gold, and Sophie, Electress of Hanover. Jack contemplates naming the ship directly after Eliza, with whom he is desperate to be reunited, but on the alchemist Enoch&#x27;s advice that this could create political complications for the Duchess, Jack ultimately christens the vessel &quot;Minerva&quot; instead.

The Cabal carries watered steel and other valuable items from India to Japan, and trades them for mercury. Mercury fetches a high price in the Americas, which need it for use in silver mines. A Spanish galleon secretly agrees to show &quot;Minerva&quot; the way across the Pacific and help them establish trade in the Americas. The galleon sinks, and &quot;Minerva&quot; takes on its two survivors, one of whom is Edmund de Ath. Jack, another member of the Cabal, and de Ath are imprisoned and tortured by the Spanish Inquisition but are able to buy their way out with silver that they got in trade for mercury.

Jack receives a letter from Eliza urging him to meet her in Qwghlm. Laden with precious metals, &quot;Minerva&quot; sails there only to find that the invitation was a trap; the French capture them and seize their gold and silver. The letter had been faked by Edmund de Ath, actually Édouard de Gex in disguise, who had been working with Vrej, one of the Cabal members, who believed his family had been wronged by Jack. &quot;Minerva&quot; and her crew are allowed to leave sans cargo, but Jack is imprisoned by the duc d&#x27;Arcachon, son of the man whose head Jack cut off in Cairo, and husband of Eliza. Upon discovering the deceit, Vrej kills the duc d&#x27;Arcachon, before committing suicide to prevent retaliation upon his family. The duc had planned to imprison Jack for the rest of his life, but the King of France Louis XIV frees him in order to enlist his help in sacking the Tower of London (and thereby England&#x27;s mint) in order to cripple the enemy country&#x27;s economy.

===The Juncto===

The book opens explaining how Bob Shaftoe had come into possession of the correspondence of d&#x27;Avaux, the French diplomat whom Eliza had fooled as a double agent for William of Orange in &quot;Quicksilver&quot;. Eliza has been captured by Jean Bart in an attempt to escape to England, and is confined to a house in Dunkerque. There both her lover Rossignol, the King&#x27;s cryptographer, and d&#x27;Avaux rush to her. Under blackmail by d&#x27;Avaux, Eliza concedes in indefinitely loaning the vast fortune she has earned through trade in Amsterdam to fund the King&#x27;s war efforts.

Her loss of fortune forces Eliza to return to court life, where she learns that the duc d&#x27;Arcachon was the man who had enslaved her and her mother from the isle of Qwghlm. Eliza soon begins plotting to kill him. However, before she can do so, she learns of d&#x27;Arcachon&#x27;s death at the hands of Jack. Jack had pronounced over the body of d&#x27;Arcachon that he killed him for a lover. Upon the return of his head to France, d&#x27;Avaux realizes who the lover of Jack is. Before Eliza&#x27;s relationship with Jack can be revealed, Eliza marries Étienne, the son of the duc and becomes Duchess d&#x27;Arcachon.

After the marriage, however, Eliza&#x27;s illegitimate child with Rossignol is kidnapped under the orders of Lothar von Hacklheber in order to maintain leverage over her. To exact her revenge, Eliza engages in a series of financial maneuvers involving the French preparations to invade England. The invasion is ultimately called off in the aftermath of the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue, but Eliza&#x27;s manipulations succeed at making her wealthier than ever, while bringing the house of Hacklheber to its knees.

The story refocuses on Bob Shaftoe, as he and the Black Torrent Guard participate in William III&#x27;s campaign against James II in Ireland.

The second half of the book follows the lives of Eliza, Leibniz, Newton, Waterhouse, and Sophia Charlotte over the next 10 years. Waterhouse confronts Newton over his increasingly unstable behavior and his fruitless attempts to derive a &quot;theory of everything&quot; under the enabling influence of Newton&#x27;s close friend Fatio. Several characters from the Royal Society form &quot;the Juncto&quot;, a society that aims to reignite the British commerce through a monetary reform. The Juncto creates the Bank of England and offers Newton a job as the director of the Mint. Eliza is infected with smallpox, but survives. She meets her old friend Princess Eleanor, who was exiled to a dower-house by her second husband, John George IV; she pays him back by infecting him with smallpox as well, and he turns out not to be as lucky. Princess Eleanor dies, and her daughter, Caroline, is adopted by Sophia Charlotte. Caroline turns out to be a bright girl with an interest in natural sciences and she soon forms a friendship with Leibniz.

The story ends in 1702 with Eliza a wealthy duchess of Arcachon and Qwghlm and a widow, Newton at the head of the London Mint, Waterhouse having made the decision to move to Massachusetts and to work on his Logic Mill away from European distractions, Sophia Charlotte the queen of the newly formed Kingdom of Prussia, and Leibniz the president of Prussian Academy of Sciences.

==Style==

Andrew Leonard points out that &quot;Confusion&quot; features more bent reality like Stephenson&#x27;s science fiction than &quot;Quicksilver&quot;. Also, Leonard notes that the book is more focused on &quot;Kidnapping, murder, torture, war, poison, treachery, romance and despair&quot; than &quot;Quicksilver&quot; had been.

Comments about Stephenson&#x27;s humor pervade its reviews. The &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot;, called it &quot;rich, clever, [and] as dryly funny as ever.&quot;

==Themes==
As in &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, Stephenson is concerned with the development of modern economics, science, politics, currency, information technology, trade, religion and cryptography. Even though Stephenson deals with these ideas at extreme length, &quot;His attention to detail and relish for providing historical context provide the attentive reader with a liberal education, while his imagination and humor delight.&quot;

Overwhelmingly &quot;The Confusion&quot; has an emphasis on the economy that had not been present as fully in &quot;Quicksilver&quot;. Andrew Leonard contrasted &quot;The Confusion&quot; with &quot;Quicksilver&quot; saying &quot;If one could argue that &quot;Quicksilver&quot; was about the birth of the scientific method and the application of Reason to unlocking the mysteries of existence, then one could also say &quot;The Confusion&quot; is about money.&quot; The book focuses a lot on bankers, the mining of gold and silver in the new world, and the idea of breaking free from precious metals into the use of Money.

He particularly explores the amount of excess involved in period governments and the financial system as well as the upper classes. Leonard said that &quot;Stephenson seems to be telling us throughout the &quot;Baroque Cycle&quot; is that the actual way things really happened—the way systems of credit were created, or timber delivered—is just as kooky as anything that a fabulist could concoct out of the wild speculation of his or her own mind.&quot; The style too, mimics this excess emphasizing exaggerated ideas and actions. One reviewer, examining this complexity and excess, called it &quot;a baroque church organ, in the middle of playing a complicated fugue at full throttle. At its end, either the reader has fled or is mesmerised, waiting to know what will happen next.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Reviewers of &quot;Confusion&quot; were impressed by its quality, some noting the greater complexity and others its more action oriented approach.
Andrew Leonard of Salon.com noted that &quot;Confusion&quot; moved much faster than &quot;Quicksilver&quot; did, not getting bogged down in an overwhelming amount of detail. He notes that Stephenson is willing to go into excess on certain ideas, developing some plot twists in exhaustive detail.
David Larsen of the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; noted &quot;The title is a praiseworthy piece of truth in advertising.&quot; His overall commentary on the piece notes how overly complicated the plot was, drawing heavily on the complexity developed in &quot;Quicksilver&quot;. Yet still discussing his interest and appreciation of the story he wrote &quot;but don&#x27;t be deterred. Bring on volume three.&quot;

<doc id="569243" wikidata="Q1137368" url="?curid=569243" title="Ghana Air Force">
<text>The Ghana Air Force (GHF) is the aerial warfare organizational military branch of the Ghanaian Armed Forces (GAF). The GHF, along with the Ghanaian army (GA) and Ghanaian navy (GN), make up the Ghanaian Armed Forces (GAF), which are controlled by the Ghanaian Ministry of Defence (MoD).

==History==
The GHF (Ghana Air Force) started on 24 July 1959 as a Flying Training School with Israeli instructors and technicians, under the command of Lt. Col. Adam Shatkay of the IAF. The School was established as a cradle of a service to complement the Army and the Navy. Later that year a headquarters was established in Accra under the command of Indian Air commodore K. Jaswant-Singh who was appointed as the first Chief of Air Staff (CAS).
In 1960 Royal Air Force personnel took up the task of training the newly established Ghana Air Force and in 1961 they were joined by a small group of Royal Canadian Air Force personnel. In September 1961 as part of President Kwame Nkrumah&#x27;s Africanization program, a Ghanaian CAS was appointed, with the first being J.E.S. de Graft-Hayford, born in the U.K. of Ghanaian descent.

The Ghana Air Force was in the beginning equipped with a squadron of Chipmunk trainers, and squadrons of Beavers, Otters and Caribou transport aircraft. In addition a DH125 jet was bought for Kwame Nkrumah, Hughes helicopters were bought for mosquito spraying plus DH Doves and Herons. British-made Westland Whirlwind helicopters and a squadron of Italian-made MB-326 ground attack/trainer jets were also purchased.

In 1962 the national School of Gliding was set up by Hanna Reitsch, who was once Adolf Hitler&#x27;s top personal pilot. Under the command of Air Commodore de Graft-Hayford, she served as director, operations instructor and trainer of the school. She also acted as the personal pilot of Kwame Nkrumah from 1962 to 1966. 

Current day, the air force has been advancing evacuation capabilities in Ghana through the US-Ghanaian partnership.
==Organisation==
The GHF headquarters is located at Burma Camp and the main transport airfield is the Air Force Base Accra, which shares the same runway with the Kotoka International Airport. Other GHF airfields include:
* Air Force Base Tamale, which shares its runway with the Tamale Airport.
* GHF Air Force Station Sekondi-Takoradi started as RAF Station Takoradi, then became Ghana Air Force Station Sekondi-Takoradi on 1 March 1961. The Chipmunk Basic Trainer Aircraft was the first aircraft used at the Station with an all Rank Air Force Station. 
*GHF Air Force station Accra came into being soon after the Royal Air Force (RAF) had taken over the administration from the Indian and Israeli Air Force officers at the beginning of 1961. The station was housed at No 3 hangar at the Accra Airport (Kotoka International Airport) with hardly any aircraft. The Unit had four main sub-units, i.e. the Administration Wing, Flying Wing, Technical Wing and Equipment Wing. The School of Technical Training was also located at this station. The Station moved from No 3 hangar to its present location in Burma Camp towards the end of 1965.

==Mission==
The role of the Ghana Air Force, as defined in the National Defence Policy, is to provide &quot;Air Transport and Offensive Air Support to the Ghana Armed Forces and to protect the territorial air space of Ghana&quot;. The National Defense Policy states certain specific tasks which the Ghana Air Force is expected to perform:

* To maintain Fighter Ground Attack capability and provide Close Air Support during operation.
* To provide transport support to the Ghana Armed Forces.
* To provide surveillance over the air space of Ghana and over the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
* To provide liaison and recce flight capability.
* To provide VIP flight capability.
* To provide transport support for civilians as government directs.
* To provide medical evacuation and air rescue assistance.
The Ghana Air Force is also responsible for the co-ordination and direction of Search and Rescue (SAR) within the Accra Flight Information Region.

==Aircraft==

<text>The Airspeed AS.10 Oxford is a twin-engine monoplane aircraft developed and manufactured by Airspeed. It saw widespread use for training British Commonwealth aircrews in navigation, radio-operating, bombing and gunnery roles throughout the Second World War.

The Oxford was developed by Airspeed during the 1930s in response to a requirement for a capable trainer aircraft that conformed with Specification T.23/36, which had been issued by the British Air Ministry. Its basic design is derived from the company&#x27;s earlier AS.6 Envoy, a commercial passenger aircraft. After its maiden flight by Percy Colman on 19 June 1937, it was quickly put into production as part of a rapid expansion of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in anticipation of a large-scale conflict.

As a consequence of the outbreak of war, many thousands of Oxfords were ordered by Britain and its allies, including Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, Poland, and the United States. Following the end of the conflict, the Oxford continued to achieve export sales for some time, equipping the newly formed air forces of Egypt, India, Israel, and Yugoslavia. It was considered to be a capable trainer aircraft throughout the conflict, as well as being used as a general-purpose type. A number of Oxfords are preserved today on static display worldwide.

==Development==
During the 1930s, a major expansion of the Royal Air Force (RAF) had been directed by the British government, which led to the formulation and issuing of a number of operational requirements by the Air Ministry. One of these was Operational Requirement 42 (OR.42), which sought an advanced training aircraft to be specifically used by aircrews destined to serve on bomber aircraft. As the RAF was in the process of migrating from biplanes to monoplanes, which were capable of greater speeds and had more demanding flight characteristics, a suitable trainer was needed to match this step change. At one point, the Avro Anson was considered for the role, however, it was thought that an aircraft more difficult to fly would be necessary. Accordingly, on 10 July 1936, Specification T.23/36 was issued to Airspeed for the development of a twin-engined training aircraft to meet OR.42.
Developed to meet the requirements of Specification T.23/36 by Airspeed, the Oxford was based on the company&#x27;s existing commercial 8-seater aircraft, the AS.6 Envoy, designed by Hessell Tiltman. Seven Envoys had already been modified for the South African Air Force (SAAF) as the &quot;Convertible Envoy&quot;, which could be equipped at short notice with bomb racks and with a machine-gun in a hand-operated Armstrong Whitworth dorsal turret. Airspeed gained substantial benefit from its prior work on the Envoy and the Convertible Envoy in its development of the Oxford. The Air Ministry approved of the project, leading to an initial order for the type being placed during 1937.

It was decided to opt for a large first batch, totalling 136 aircraft, as this allowed for the implementation of more economical flow-line production at Airspeed&#x27;s Portsmouth factory. On 19 June 1937, the first prototype Oxford, &quot;L4534&quot;, was first flown by chief test pilot C H A &#x27;Percy&#x27; Colman from Portsmouth. Initially, two variants were planned; the Mark I, which was viewed as a general-purpose training aircraft equipped with a dorsal gun turret, and the Mark II, which lacked any turret but was instead fitted with dual controls. As further large contracts for the aircraft were placed with Airspeed, (100 Mk Is and 100 Mk IIs) it was arranged that de Havilland Aircraft would build them at Hatfield later, to meet the demands for Oxfords for training. Other companies also manufactured the aircraft.

By the end of production, a total of 8,751 Oxfords had been completed. Of these, 4,411 had been produced by Airspeed at its Portsmouth factory, another 550 at the Airspeed-run shadow factory at Christchurch, Dorset, 1,515 by de Havilland at Hatfield, 1,360 by Percival Aircraft at Luton and 750 by Standard Motors at Coventry.

==Design==

The Oxford was a low-wing twin-engine cantilever monoplane, featuring a semi-monocoque constructed fuselage, a conventional landing gear configuration and a wooden tail unit. It was capable of reproducing the flight characteristics of many contemporary front-line aircraft then in military service. It was specifically developed to be suitable for a range of training missions, including navigation, flying instruction, night flying, instrument flying, wireless, direction-finding, gunnery, and vertical photography. The Oxford was specifically planned and developed to incorporate various modern innovations and equipment fittings, including a full array of instruments and controls within the cockpit, which assisted in its principal trainer role. In addition, the Oxford could also be used in various secondary roles, such as an air ambulance and maritime patrol aircraft.

In terms of flying experience, the Oxford was suitably representative as to enable pilots to migrate onto larger transport aircraft with ease while possessing smooth flight characteristics. The controls were relatively straightforward, typically remaining consistent and easily adjustable; the second pilot&#x27;s position is also provided with a fully furnished suite of key flight instrumentation. It was equipped with the standard blind-flying panel, incorporating an airspeed indicator, altimeter, artificial horizon, directional
gyroscope, rate of climb indicator and turn indicator. Life support equipment includes three oxygen regulators, a flowmeter, three bayonet unions and three high-pressure oxygen cylinders of 750 litres capacity. The external view of the cockpit was considered to be very high for the era, superior to the majority of its contemporaries, but is unavoidably interrupted by the engine cowlings acting as blind spots.

It was normally operated by a three-man crew; the seating arrangement could be altered in order to suit various purposes, such as to better enable a specific training role. The cockpit was outfitted with dual flying controls and a pair of seats, intended to accommodate a pilot and either a navigator or second pilot alongside. When used for bomb aimer training, the second set of controls would be removed and the freed-up space was instead used to accommodate a prone bomb-aimer. When used as a navigation trainer, the second seat was pushed back so that it would line up with the chart table. Aft of the cockpit was a wireless operator station, facing aft on the starboard side of the fuselage. On the Oxford I, a dorsal turret was located amidships; it could be used for training navigators, bomb-aimers, wireless operators, air gunners and camera operators. The centre section can contain up to 16 11 lb. practice bombs, which are controlled via bomb-release switches installed at the pilot and bomb-aimers&#x27; stations.
The Oxford was normally powered by a pair of Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah X air-cooled radial engines, capable of generating 340 hp. These were initially outfitted with wooden fixed-position de Havilland-built propellers, but had been designed from the onset to accommodate variable-pitch propellers when these became available. However, only 199 (Mk.V) were actually equipped with variable-pitch propellers, but all Oxford cockpits contained a propeller pitch lever, allowing an instructor to insist it was moved from &quot;Coarse&quot; to &quot;Fine&quot; for landing to reinforce this important step for trainee pilots. The starboard engine drives a hydraulic pump and air compressor, the former being used to actuate the undercarriage and flaps while the latter is used for the braking system; a vacuum pump is also present for the gyroscopic instrumentations. The port engine drives a 500-watt electrical generator. The engine cowling features an inlet that draws cooling air into a tank; a pair of tinned steel oil tanks are also contained within the cowling. Welded steel construction was used for the nacelles, which attach to the centre section of the wing at four separate rubber-insulated joints.

The retractable undercarriage of the Oxford was internally designed, featuring broken-braced twin oleo legs that retract rearward into each engine nacelle. Although actuation of the retraction mechanism is normally achieved via an engine-driven pump, a manual fall-back mechanism is provided to force the wheels down in the event of an in-flight engine failure. The undercarriage wheels are equipped with pneumatically-operated brakes, controlled by a lever set on each control column. For inspection purposes, access panels are located beneath the pilot&#x27;s cockpit for internal access to the flight controls, hydraulics and electrical components; inspection panels are also present in the outer wing sections.

The semi-monocoque fuselage of Oxford uses an arrangement of spruce longerons and stiffeners underneath a plywood exterior. It is constructed in two sections on separate jigs, divided between the front and rear, these are joined together at the rear bulkhead. The forward bulkhead is deliberately reinforced so that the structure is capable of withstanding the impact of the aircraft turning over during landing in the hands of an unfortunate trainee pilot. Both the elevator and fin of the tail unit used a wooden spar and rib structure covered by fabric. The fuselage can be partially dismantled, the wing dividing into three separate sections, so that it can be road-transported. The wing uses a stressed-skin ply-covered structure using spruce flanges and ply webs. The spars are assembled upon a single jig, while others are used for the elements of the leading edge and trailing edge. Similar construction to the centre section is also used in the outer panels. The wings are outfitted with hydraulically-operated split flaps, which extend between the ailerons.

==Operational history==
The Oxford (nicknamed the &#x27;Ox-box&#x27;) was used to prepare complete aircrews for RAF Bomber Command and could simultaneously train pilots, navigators, bomb aimers, gunners and radio operators on the same flight. In addition to training duties, Oxfords were used in communications and anti-submarine roles and as air ambulances in the Middle East.

The Oxford was the preferred trainer for the Empire Air Training Scheme and British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP), with over 2,900 sent to Commonwealth countries; Australia, Canada (where the majority of training was carried out), New Zealand, South Africa, and Southern Rhodesia. 27 Oxfords were on the strength of No 4 Flying Training School RAF Habbaniya, Iraq in early 1941 and some were converted locally for use as light bombers to help in the defence of the School against Iraqi forces.

Oxfords continued to serve the Royal Air Force as trainers and light transports until the last was withdrawn from service in 1956. A small number of ex RAF Oxfords were converted to civilian use post-war, along with 152 more that were converted into 6-seat commercial airliners called the AS.65 Consul. Meanwhile a fair number of surplus RAF aircraft were sold for use by overseas air arms, some as early as 1943, but mostly post-war. (see below)

Most Oxfords in the UK were equipped with a knotted rope from the pilot&#x27;s seat to the rear door to assist evacuation should the plane inadvertently be put into a spin, which it was almost impossible to recover from. When the pilot(s) released their seat belts centripetal force would hurl them to the rear of the plane, beyond the exit door, from which it was impossible to crawl forward to the door. The rope was installed as a response to a test by four &quot;boffins&quot; who tried to recover from a spin from 18,000 ft. When no recovery happened no matter what was tried the four released their harness and were hurled to the rear of their plane and there remained helpless as the spiral descent continued. However all was not lost. The plane was in such a flat spin when it reached the ground that it skidded sideways over the surface of a field until the tail section hit a haystack and broke off. The four &quot;boffins&quot; walked away relatively unharmed, the knotted rope being their only positive remedy for an Oxford in a spin.

===Australia===
From November 1940, the Royal Australian Air Force received 391 Oxford I and IIs from RAF contracts for use in Australia. Most of the survivors were sold in the early 1950s.

===Canada===
The Royal Canadian Air Force ordered 25 Oxford Is in 1938. They were taken from RAF stocks and shipped to Canada in 1939 and assembled by Canadian Vickers at Montreal. Issued to the Central Flying School, they were later joined by large numbers of RAF aircraft to equip the Service Flying Training Schools.
819 Oxfords of all Marks were operated by the RCAF in Canada for the BCATP during the war.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand was one of the first nations to order the Oxford in 1937 with a contract for five Oxford Is; the fifth aircraft was modified as a survey aircraft. They were delivered to New Zealand by sea and assembled at RNZAF Hobsonville at the end of 1938. The RNZAF placed further orders for six and then 30 Oxfords. With the start of the Commonwealth Air Training Plan a further 140 aircraft were allocated, which included the last batch of 30 ordered. In total, the RNZAF operated 299 Oxfords between 1938 and 1952.

===South Africa===
As part of the Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the South African Air Force was allocated nearly 700 Oxfords which started to arrive in South Africa from November 1940. Due to the intense training, 256 aircraft were lost to accidents. Most survivors were withdrawn in 1945 and had been sold by 1947.

===United Kingdom===
====Amy Johnson&#x27;s Final Flight====
In January 1941, whilst flying an Oxford for the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), the aviator Amy Johnson flew off-course in adverse weather conditions, until her aircraft crashed into the Thames Estuary. Accounts vary, but it is generally accepted that she bailed out, then succumbed to the intense cold whilst in the water, and may then have been dragged underneath a rescue vessel. In difficult sea conditions, the Captain of the rescue vessel (Lt Cmdr Walter Fletcher) entered the water in an attempt to retrieve what was thought to be a body, but he lost consciousness in the extreme cold, and died in hospital several days later.

===United States===
The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) used 137 Oxfords on loan from the Royal Air Force. Most were used as general-purpose communications aircraft in the United Kingdom; from June 1942 they were also used for Beam Approach training. By the end of 1944, American types were available, and all USAAF Oxfords had been returned to the RAF. A small number had also been loaned to the USAAF in Australia by the Royal Australian Air Force. Two Oxfords were used by the United States Navy in the United Kingdom as communications aircraft.

<text>The Douglas X-3 Stiletto is a 1950s United States experimental jet aircraft with a slender fuselage and a long tapered nose, manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company. Its primary mission was to investigate the design features of an aircraft suitable for sustained supersonic speeds, which included the first use of titanium in major airframe components. Douglas designed the X-3 with the goal of a maximum speed of approximately , but it was seriously underpowered for this purpose and could not even exceed Mach 1 in level flight. Although the research aircraft was a disappointment, Lockheed designers used data from the X-3 tests for the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter which used a similar trapezoidal wing design in a successful Mach 2 fighter.

==Design and development==
The Douglas X-3 Stiletto was the sleekest of the early experimental aircraft, but its research accomplishments were not those originally planned. It was originally intended for advanced Mach 2 turbojet propulsion testing, but it fell largely into the category of configuration explorers, as it never met its original performance goals due to inadequate engines. The goal of the aircraft was ambitious—it was to take off from the ground under its own power, climb to high altitude, maintain a sustained cruise speed of Mach 2, then land under its own power. The aircraft was also to test the feasibility of low-aspect-ratio wings, and the large-scale use of titanium in aircraft structures. The design of the Douglas X-3 Stiletto is the subject of U.S. Design Patent #172,588 granted on July 13, 1954, to Frank N. Fleming and Harold T. Luskin and assigned to the Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc.

Construction of a pair of X-3s was approved on 30 June 1949. During development, the X-3&#x27;s planned Westinghouse J46 engines were unable to meet the thrust, size and weight requirements, so lower-thrust Westinghouse J34 turbojets were substituted, producing only of thrust with afterburner rather than the planned . The first aircraft was built and delivered to Edwards Air Force Base, California, on 11 September 1952.

The X-3 featured an unusual slender, streamlined shape having a very long, gently-tapered nose and small trapezoidal wings. The aim was to create the thinnest and most slender shape possible in order to achieve low drag at supersonic speeds. The extended nose was to allow for the provision of test equipment while the semi-buried cockpit and windscreen were designed to alleviate the effects of &quot;thermal thicket&quot; conditions. The low aspect ratio, unswept wings were designed for high speed and later the Lockheed design team used data from the X-3 tests for the similar F-104 Starfighter wing design. Due to both engine and airframe problems, the partially completed second aircraft was cancelled, and its components were used for spare parts.

==Operational history==
The first X-3 &quot;hop&quot; was made on 15 October 1952, by Douglas test pilot Bill Bridgeman. During a high-speed taxi test, Bridgeman lifted the X-3 off the ground and flew it about one mile (1.6 km) before settling back onto the lakebed. The official first flight was made by Bridgeman on 20 October and lasted about 20 minutes. He made a total of 26 flights (counting the hop) by the end of the Douglas tests in December 1953. These showed that the X-3 was severely underpowered and difficult to control; its takeoff speed was unusually high—. More seriously, the X-3 did not approach its planned top speed. Its first supersonic flight required that the airplane make a 15° dive to reach Mach 1.1. The X-3&#x27;s fastest flight, made on 28 July 1953, reached Mach 1.208 in a 30° dive. A plan to re-engine the X-3 with rocket motors was considered but eventually dropped.

With the completion of the contractor test program in December 1953, the X-3 was delivered to the United States Air Force. The poor performance of the X-3 meant only an abbreviated program would be made, to gain experience with low aspect ratio wings. Lieutenant Colonel Frank Everest and Major Chuck Yeager each made three flights. Although flown by Air Force pilots, these were counted as NACA flights. With the last flight by Yeager in July 1954, NACA made plans for a limited series of research flights with the X-3. The initial flights looked at longitudinal stability and control, wing and tail loads, and pressure distribution.

NACA pilot Joseph A. Walker made his pilot checkout flight in the X-3 on 23 August 1954, then conducted eight research flights in September and October. By late October, the research program was expanded to include lateral and directional stability tests. In these tests, the X-3 was abruptly rolled at transonic and supersonic speeds, with the rudder kept centered. Despite its shortcomings, the X-3 was ideal for these tests. The mass of its engines, fuel and structure was concentrated in its long, narrow fuselage, while its wings were short and stubby. As a result, the X-3 was &quot;loaded&quot; along its fuselage, rather than its wings. This was typical of the fighter aircraft then in development or testing.

These tests would lead to the X-3&#x27;s most significant flight, and the near-loss of the aircraft. On 27 October 1954, Walker made an abrupt left roll at Mach 0.92 and an altitude of . The X-3 rolled as expected, but also pitched up 20° and yawed 16°. The aircraft gyrated for five seconds before Walker was able to get it back under control. He then set up for the next test point. Walker put the X-3 into a dive, accelerating to Mach 1.154 at , where he made an abrupt left roll. The aircraft pitched down and recorded an acceleration of -6.7 &quot;g&quot; (-66 m/s²), then pitched upwards to +7 &quot;g&quot; (69 m/s²). At the same time, the X-3 side-slipped, resulting in a loading of 2 &quot;g&quot; (20 m/s²). Walker managed to bring the X-3 under control and successfully landed.

The post-flight examination showed that the fuselage had been subjected to its maximum load limit. Had the acceleration been higher, the aircraft could have broken up. Walker and the X-3 had experienced &quot;roll inertia coupling,&quot; in which a maneuver in one axis will cause an uncommanded maneuver in one or two others. At the same time, several North American F-100 Super Sabres were involved in similar incidents. A research program was started by NACA to understand the problem and find solutions.

For the X-3, the roll coupling flight was the high point of its history. The aircraft was grounded for nearly a year after the flight, and never again explored its roll stability and control boundaries. Walker made another ten flights between 20 September 1955 and the last on 23 May 1956. The aircraft was subsequently retired to the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

Although the X-3 never met its intention of providing aerodynamic data in Mach 2 cruise, its short service was of value. It showed the dangers of roll inertia coupling, and provided early flight test data on the phenomenon. Its small, highly loaded unswept wing was used in the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, and it was one of the first aircraft to use titanium. Finally, the X-3&#x27;s very high takeoff and landing speeds required improvements in tire technology.

==Production==
Two aircraft were ordered, but only one was built, completing 51 test flights.

<doc id="569263" wikidata="Q424211" url="?curid=569263" title="Acute-phase protein">
<text>Acute-phase proteins (APPs) are a class of proteins whose concentrations in blood plasma either increase (positive acute-phase proteins) or decrease (negative acute-phase proteins) in response to inflammation. This response is called the &quot;acute-phase reaction&quot; (also called &quot;acute-phase response&quot;). The acute-phase reaction characteristically involves fever, acceleration of peripheral leukocytes, circulating neutrophils and their precursors. The terms &quot;acute-phase protein&quot; and &quot;acute-phase reactant&quot; (APR) are often used synonymously, although some APRs are (strictly speaking) polypeptides rather than proteins.

In response to injury, local inflammatory cells (neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages) secrete a number of cytokines into the bloodstream, most notable of which are the interleukins IL1, and IL6, and TNF-α. The liver responds by producing many acute-phase reactants. At the same time, the production of a number of other proteins is reduced; these proteins are, therefore, referred to as &quot;negative&quot; acute-phase reactants. Increased acute-phase proteins from the liver may also contribute to the promotion of sepsis.

== Regulation of synthesis ==
TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ are important for the expression of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and they also cause the production of platelet-activating factor and IL-6. After stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines, Kupffer cells produce IL-6 in the liver and present it to the hepatocytes. IL-6 is the major mediator for the hepatocytic secretion of APPs. Synthesis of APP can also be regulated indirectly by cortisol. Cortisol can enhance expression of IL-6 receptors in liver cells and induce IL-6-mediated production of APPs.  

==Positive==
Positive acute-phase proteins serve (as part of the innate immune system) different physiological functions within the immune system. Some act to destroy or inhibit growth of microbes, e.g., C-reactive protein, mannose-binding protein, complement factors, ferritin, ceruloplasmin, serum amyloid A and haptoglobin. Others give negative feedback on the inflammatory response, e.g. serpins. Alpha 2-macroglobulin and coagulation factors affect coagulation, mainly stimulating it. This pro-coagulant effect may limit infection by trapping pathogens in local blood clots. Also, some products of the coagulation system can contribute to the innate immune system by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as chemotactic agents for phagocytic cells.

==Negative==
&quot;Negative&quot; acute-phase proteins decrease in inflammation. Examples include albumin, transferrin, transthyretin, retinol-binding protein, antithrombin, transcortin. The decrease of such proteins may be used as markers of inflammation. The physiological role of decreased synthesis of such proteins is generally to save amino acids for producing &quot;positive&quot; acute-phase proteins more efficiently. Theoretically, a decrease in transferrin could additionally be decreased by an upregulation of transferrin receptors, but the latter does not appear to change with inflammation.

While the production of C3 (a complement factor) increases in the liver, the plasma concentration often lowers because of an increased turn-over, therefore it is often seen as a negative acute-phase protein.

==Clinical significance==
Measurement of acute-phase proteins, especially C-reactive protein, is a useful marker of inflammation in both medical and veterinary clinical pathology. It correlates with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), however not always directly. This is due to the ESR being largely dependent on the elevation of fibrinogen, an acute phase reactant with a half-life of approximately one week. This protein will therefore remain higher for longer despite the removal of the inflammatory stimuli. In contrast, C-reactive protein (with a half-life of 6–8 hours) rises rapidly and can quickly return to within the normal range if treatment is employed. For example, in active systemic lupus erythematosus, one may find a raised ESR but normal C-reactive protein.They may also indicate liver failure.

<text>The Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize or Guardian Award was a literary award that annually recognised one fiction book written for children or young adults (at least age eight) and published in the United Kingdom. It was conferred upon the author of the book by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, which established it in 1965 and inaugurated it in 1967. It was a lifetime award in that previous winners were not eligible. At least from 2000 the prize was £1,500. The prize was apparently discontinued after 2016, though no formal announcement appears to have been made.

==History==

The prize was established in 1965 as the &quot;only children&#x27;s book award made to writers by their fellow authors&quot;(2005 shortlist) and inaugurated by the 1967 award to Leon Garfield for &quot;Devil in the Fog&quot; (Constable &amp; Co., 1966). Through the 2000 prize, announced 28 March, it recognised one book published in the UK during the preceding calendar year.

Between the 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 cycles, the prize schedule was rearranged to culminate in October during Booktrust Children&#x27;s Book Week. &quot;[F]iction for children aged seven and above, published in the UK between January 2000 and September 2001&quot; (21 months) was eligible for the 2001 prize. Publishers were required to submit no more than ten entries by April 30.

At the same time, a summer program was inaugurated, using the newspaper&#x27;s educational website and featuring a longlist announced in July. The program initially comprised merely an opportunity to vote for longlist favourites, comments by the judges to guide summer reading, and advice on &quot;how to build a classic library of children&#x27;s books&quot;.(2001 longlist) A version of the ongoing Young Critics contest was inaugurated in 2002 and the program has expanded since then to include online discussion and author interviews and appearances. Meanwhile, announcement of the longlist has advanced to late May or early June and announcement of the winner has retreated to November.
== Conditions ==
The shortlist of no more than four books and the winner were selected by three children&#x27;s fiction writers, almost always including the latest winner. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the prize as the only children&#x27;s book award winner selected by peers. The newspaper&#x27;s children&#x27;s book editor Julia Eccleshare participated (from 2000 to 2016) in selection of the longlist and thereafter chaired the panel of final judges.

In years to 2016, a longlist of eight books was announced in May or June, a shortlist of no more than four announced in September, and a single winner. The longlist was the foundation for a summer program of reading, reviewing, and discussion.

The U.K. publishers of eligible books entered them for the prize with a fee, although the chair may call for submission. The publication year is August to July of the current year, but May, June, and July books must be submitted in advance. Books originally published in another language were eligible in English translation for five years.

Routinely, eligible books were entered for the prize by their UK publishers, as many as ten books each (2000) although chair Eccleshare also called for particular submissions.

==Honorees==

Through 2016, 52 prizes were awarded in 49 years covering 1966 to mid-2015 publications. There were co-winners in 1992 and 1996.

=== 1960s ===
=== 1970s ===
=== 1980s ===
=== 1990s ===
=== 2000s ===
Until 2000, books published in the previous year were eligible for the award, and the award included a winner and a shortlist. In 2001, the award cycle was rescheduled to conclude in the fall rather than the spring. At the same time, a longlist of seven books was instituted with a shortlist of four to six books.
=== 2010s ===
==Winners of multiple awards==

Six books have won both the Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize and the Carnegie Medal (inaugurated 1936), which annually recognizes an outstanding book for children or young adults.

(Dates are years of U.K. publication, which were Carnegie award dates before 2006.)
* Alan Garner, &quot;The Owl Service&quot; (1967)
* Richard Adams, &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1972)
* Geraldine McCaughrean, &quot;A Pack of Lies&quot; (1988)
* Anne Fine, &quot;Goggle-Eyes&quot; (1989)
* Philip Pullman, &quot;His Dark Materials 1: Northern Lights&quot; (1995)
* Melvin Burgess, &quot;Junk&quot; (1996)
In 2001, &quot;The Seeing Stone&quot; by Kevin Crossley-Holland won the Tir na n-Og Award, best English-language book for young people with &quot;authentic Welsh background&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; by Mark Haddon won the 2003 Whitbread Awards as the year&#x27;s best novel (not children&#x27;s book) and the &quot;Book of the Year&quot; across all five categories. &quot;The Guardian&quot; children&#x27;s book editor Eccleshare wrote, &quot;Published on both an adult and a children&#x27;s list, it is one of the few titles for which the ubiquitous claim of &#x27;crossover&#x27; is not a gimmick. It genuinely has equal, though different, appeal to all readers – 15-year-old Christopher Boone&#x27;s narrative voice is at once childlike in its observations, and adult in its profundity.&quot;

In 2007, Pullman&#x27;s &quot;Northern Lights&quot; was named &quot;Carnegie of Carnegies&quot; for the award&#x27;s 70-year celebration.

== Summer programme ==

The Young Critics competition was inaugurated in 2002 and is still underway. The newspaper solicited 200-word reviews of books on the longlist from children 16 and younger, with the prize being &quot;a day editing and printing up their reviews&quot;.(retrospective by CA, 23 Sep 2002)

Ten years later there are dual competitions for children 17 and younger, one for individuals and one for teams of at least four schoolmates. There are cash prizes and free sets of the longlist books to the winners. Up to 30 students from the winning school also get a day at one &quot;Guardian&quot; site.(2012 Young Critics)
The Young Critics contests are judged by Eccleshare, who also helps select the longlist, and another &quot;Guardian&quot; editor.

Beside the competition there is a summer book club that features one longlist book each week, with author interviews and discussion.

<text>Achilles Tatius (Greek: Ἀχιλλεὺς Τάτιος, &quot;Achilleus Tatios&quot;) of Alexandria was a Roman-era Greek writer of the 2nd century AD whose fame is attached to his only surviving work, the ancient Greek novel, or &quot;romance&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Leucippe and Clitophon&quot;.

==Life and minor works==
Eustathius of Thessalonica (in his commentary on Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; 14.350), the &quot;Suda&quot;, Photius, in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (cod. 87), and the manuscript tradition all affirm he lived and wrote in Alexandria. The papyrus, and linguistic evidence demonstrate he flourished early in the 2nd century AD. 
Suda preserves a tradition that &quot;He became at last a Christian and a bishop.&quot; There are literary parallels between Leucippe and Clitophon and the Christian Acts of Andrew, a roughly contemporary composition.
The &quot;Suda&quot; also ascribes to the author a work on the sphere (in Greek ), a fragment of which, professing to be an introduction to the &quot;Phaenomena&quot; of Aratus, may still be extant (in Greek ). This, however, may be the work of another Achilles Tatius, who lived in the 3rd century. This work is referred to by Firmicus Maternus, who about 336 speaks of the &quot;prudentissimus Achilles&quot; in his &quot;Matheseos libri&quot; (&quot;Math.&quot; iv. 10). The fragment was first published in 1567, then in the &quot;Uranologion&quot; of the Jesuit scholar Denis Pétau, with a Latin translation in 1630. The same source also mentions a work of Achilles Tatius on etymology, and another entitled &quot;Miscellaneous Histories&quot;.

<text>American Public Television (APT) is an American nonprofit organization and syndicator of programming for public television stations in the United States. It distributes public television programs nationwide for PBS member stations and independent educational stations, as well as the Create and World television networks.

==History==
===Eastern Educational Network===
APT began in 1960 when it was incorporated as the Eastern Educational Network (EEN). At first, EEN was a regional cooperative that began to exchange programs between a few of its member stations. EEN was one of the first distributors of shows such as &quot;The French Chef&quot; (with Julia Child) in 1962, &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, and &quot;Washington Week in Review&quot; on a national basis.

Another first from EEN was the distribution of &quot;Newsfront&quot;, America&#x27;s first live and non-commercial daily news program, starting in 1970. EEN introduced &quot;Wall Street Week&quot; in November 1970 before PBS began distributing it nationwide in January 1972. EEN also began importing UK&#x27;s BBC and Canadian CBC productions to America in 1974, with &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; as one of them. In 1978, the EEN started the Free Library.

In 1980, Eastern Educational Network started the Syndication Service and was renamed Interregional Program Service (IPS). IPS started the Premium Service in 1989. The first program out of this arm was the series &quot;U.S. Chronicle&quot;, a collaboration of public television stations in cooperation with The Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting, hosted by Jim Lehrer. The company gained national attention when EEN&#x27;s IPS subsidiary begin distributing &quot;The Nightly Business Report&quot; when it went nationwide in 1981. The organization became American Program Service (APS) in 1992.

===American Public Television===
American Program Service was renamed American Public Television (APT) on January 1, 2000. Also, with many fax requests from international outlets, an international division called APT Worldwide was started. 

With the digital roll-out, APT became the distributor of a couple of multicast networks. In January 2006, APT started distributing Create. They later began distributing World on July 1, 2009.

==Programming services==

<doc id="569299" wikidata="Q2483038" url="?curid=569299" title="Virtual queue systems at Disney Parks">
<text>Disney Parks have utilized virtual queue systems since the introduction of the FastPass System in 1999. These systems allow theme park visitors to wait in a virtual queue for an attraction, reducing the time spent in line. Depending on the system, access to virtual queues may come with park admission or may be an additional charge. Currently available virtual queue systems are Disney Genie at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World, and Disney Premier Access at Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, Tokyo Disney Resort, and Shanghai Disney Resort. Previous systems include FastPass, FastPass+, and MaxPass.

==Current virtual queue systems==

=== Lightning Lane ===
Lightning Lane is an optional paid service that allows guests to enter an express line queue with shorter wait times at select attractions. Guests who purchase access to Lightning Lane must book an available time slot to enter the express line queue. At Disney World, this can be done up to three days in advance of the guest&#x27;s scheduled visit to the park, while at Disneyland, this must be done same day after entering the park. Lightning Lane consists of single and multi-pass options. Prior to an overhaul in July 2024, the multi-pass option was known as Genie+.

Lightning lanes are purchased via Disney Genie a service available at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort that is offered through the My Disney Experience mobile app. Named after the Disney character from the 1992 animated film &quot;Aladdin&quot;, the Genie portion of the system is a free tool for guests that assists with itinerary planning, reservation tracking, and checking wait times. 

To use Disney Genie, guests are required to have valid park admission as well as a Disney park reservation for the same day. The system employs dynamic pricing, with prices varying based on current demand and time of day. Disney Genie was introduced in 2021 and replaced FastPass, which offered a service similar to Lightning Lane for no additional fee or upcharge.

===Disney Premier Access===
Disney Premier Access is a paid queue bypass system introduced by the Walt Disney Company and the Oriental Land Company currently offered at Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, Tokyo Disney Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort. The system allows guests to pay to avoid long lines at select attractions or access dedicated seating areas for select shows on which the system is offered. Guests select or are offered a designated return time window, when they must arrive at the dedicated Premier Access entrance to utilize their Disney Premier Access reservation. Alternatively, at Disneyland Paris, guests may purchase Premier Access Ultimate, which allows one entry into each participating attraction on the chosen day via the Premier Access entrance.

The system is believed to have been introduced initially as a response to ticket scalping of the physical paper fastpass tickets at Shanghai Disneyland. The system was formally called Disney Priority Special and Priority Special+ at the Hong Kong resort.

====Tokyo Disney Resort Priority Pass====
Tokyo Disney Resort has offered a &quot;40th Anniversary Priority Pass&quot; for certain rides, which is free of charge and functions identically to the original FastPass, save that it is requested and redeemed via the Tokyo Disney Resort app since July 26, 2023. Disney Premier Access is sold, also via the app, for the most popular rides, and for reserved viewing areas for select shows and parades. Additionally, guests staying in an official hotel who have purchased a &quot;vacation package&quot; obtain a number of attraction tickets which are used for entry via the same Premier Access/Priority Pass line. Following the end of the 40th Anniversary celebrations on March 31, 2024, this system is just called the &quot;Tokyo Disney Resort Priority Pass&quot;.

==Former virtual queue systems==

===FastPass===
FastPass was a virtual queue system first introduced in late 1999 by the Walt Disney Company to speed up customer access to certain attractions and amenities at the Disney resorts and theme parks. The system allowed guests to avoid long lines at the attractions on which the system was installed, freeing them to partake in other attractions during their wait. There was generally no extra fee for the service. FastPass was predominantly offered at very popular attractions; at a later stage, it was made available additionally for select shows, offering access to a roped-off viewing area.
To use FastPass, a guest would scan their park ticket at an automated machine, usually located adjacent to or in the vicinity of the attraction they wanted to experience. The machine would print a ticket giving a half-hour or one-hour time range (depending on the park) for the guest to return. When the guest returned, they would have the option to skip the line, entering another queue. Displays near the machines would show the current return times which would be made available; it was not possible to select a different time. In later years at some parks, guests entering a FastPass queue would need to scan their original park ticket rather than the FastPass ticket; this process was implemented to combat the resale of FastPass tickets. The FastPass &quot;ticket&quot; would in this scenario act merely as a reminder of the time of their return slot.

Return slots typically became available soon after the park opened to guests, but not during Extra Magic Hours (early park access open to guests at preferred hotels). The return time advanced in five-minute increments as FastPasses were distributed, and when the park closing time was reached, no further FastPasses were distributed for that attraction that day.

To allow for a wide distribution of FastPass tickets, a guest holding a FastPass could not obtain another FastPass until the beginning of the return timeslot allocated to them. Over time, this changed to allow another FastPass to be obtained two hours after the last one was printed, even if the return time was further away. Additionally, a FastPass for a show, such as World of Color, could be held additionally to a ride FastPass. Any attempt to obtain a FastPass in breach of the waiting period would result in an error message being printed on a FastPass slip, informing the guest of the time they could next obtain a FastPass.

At Walt Disney World the FastPass system was replaced by the FastPass+ system in 2014.

At Tokyo Disney Resort the FastPasses were obtainable via the app in latter years, avoiding the need to physically walk to the desired attraction, but it was still necessary to have entered the relevant park that day.

In later years at Disneyland Resort the original FastPass system was offered alongside MaxPass. Disney&#x27;s FastPass service was available at no additional charge to all park guests, while MaxPass has an associated fee. 

On August 18, 2021, it was announced that the FastPass, FastPass+ and MaxPass would officially be retired in favor of the new Disney Genie service in Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

The FastPass system was replaced by Disney Premier Access at Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland, Tokyo Disney Resort and Shanghai Disneyland.

====FastPass promotions====
Throughout the annual Disney Soundsational Summer promotions of 2011–2012, guests staying at any of the three hotels of the Disneyland Resort received two complimentary FastPasses per person. These passes allowed guests to enter the FastPass line of any FastPass attraction (plus The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Undersea Adventure, which does not otherwise offer FastPass) at any time they chose, similar to the Dream FastPass.

During summer of 2011–2012 at Disneyland Paris, guests who stayed in the Disneyland Hotel or in club-level accommodations of hotels received an untimed single-use FastPass voucher for each day of their stays, usable any time except between 13:00 and 16:00. Guests in Castle Club accommodations at the Disneyland Hotel or suites in any hotel instead received a VIP FastPass, which could be used repeatedly for the full length of stay with no time restrictions. In each case, the FastPass was usable only on rides with FastPass facilities. This offer was retained until 2020, at which point it was retired.

===FastPass+===
FastPass+ was a system that allowed guests to reserve and plan a visit in advance to parks at Walt Disney World. Reservations were available for select attractions, Character Greetings, entertainment, and viewing areas for parades and fireworks. The system allowed guests to make reservations up to 60 days in advance, and change at any time. FastPass+ was a reservation and scheduling system, unlike the old paper FastPass system, which was a virtual queuing concept. Additionally, guests were encouraged to reserve FastPass+ sections with their group and were allowed to change the group&#x27;s FastPass+ reservation. Guests that stayed at an onsite Disney resort could make reservations up to 60 days in advance while all other guests could schedule reservations up to 30 days in advance, assuming tickets were linked to their account. Annual Passholders could hold FastPass+ reservations for up to 7 different days in the 30-day window. If a Passholder stayed at a Disney resort onsite, they also had 60 days to make reservations for the entire length of the stay.

Guests could make three reservations in advance for each day, and all three were required to be at the same theme park. Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios separated the attractions available for reservation into two tiers. Guests were restricted in the combination of attractions they were able to reserve in these parks to ensure better reservation availability for others at the parks&#x27; most popular attractions. Guests had the option to make a further reservation via an in-park kiosk or the My Disney Experience app after they had used their initial three selections subject to availability. They had the option to continue to make further reservations after using each reservation, until all reservation slots had been allocated for the day.

Disney FastPass+ was not operational at Disney World after the parks reopened in July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic closures. This was cited as due to the need to create proper social distancing.

The FastPass+ system was permanently discontinued and replaced in October 2021 by Disney Genie.

===MaxPass===
MaxPass was a virtual queue system first introduced in 2017, for the Disneyland Resort. The system worked in conjunction with the original FastPass system, which remained available and free of charge. MaxPass allowed virtual queue reservations to be made from the Disneyland App without having to walk to the desired attraction. It was Disney&#x27;s first premium virtual queue system, costing /day or $75/year upon launch in 2017. On January 6, 2018, Disney increased the price to /day, and /year. It was included with select Disneyland Annual Passports. The system allowed users to receive a FastPass return time on their smartphone through the Disneyland mobile app when they were inside the parks. Guests who bought the MaxPass system were also able to download their PhotoPass pictures for free.

The origin of the system can be tracked back to a patent filed on August 30, 2007, by the Walt Disney Company for using SMS as a way to get and use FastPasses in the park. The patent indicated that guests staying at Disney hotels would be allowed to make early reservations for attractions using their in-room television.

The MaxPass system was permanently discontinued and replaced in December 2021 by Disney Genie.

<text>Sir Henry Fowler, (29 July 1870 – 16 October 1938) was an English railway engineer, and was chief mechanical engineer of the Midland Railway and subsequently the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.

== Biography ==

Fowler was born in Evesham, Worcestershire, on 29 July 1870. His father, also named Henry, was a furniture dealer, and his family were Quakers. He was educated at Prince Henry&#x27;s Grammar School, Evesham (now Prince Henry&#x27;s High School, Evesham), and at Mason Science College (which became the University of Birmingham) between 1885 and 1887 where he studied metallurgy. He served an apprenticeship under John Aspinall at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR)&#x27;s Horwich Works from 1887 to 1891. Fowler was elected as a Whitworth Exhibitioner in 1891. He then spent four years in the Testing Department under George Hughes, whom he succeeded as head of the department.

He married Emmie Needham Smith in 1895, and they had three children. Emmie died in 1934.

Between 1895 and 1900, he was gas engineer of the L&amp;YR, moving on 18 June 1900 to the Midland Railway (MR). On 1 November 1905 he became assistant works manager, being promoted to works manager two years later. 

In 1908, following a visit to Sheffield, he is accredited with the formation of the Midland Railway Engineering Club which is now called the Derby Railway Engineering Society. 

In 1909, he succeeded Richard Deeley as chief mechanical engineer (CME) of the MR.

Between 1915 and 1919, Fowler was employed on war work and James Anderson became acting CME. During the First World War he was seconded to the Ministry of Munitions, being director of production from 1915 to 1917 and then assistant director general of aircraft production. In 1919, Fowler was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his contributions to the war effort.

On the Grouping of 1923, he was appointed deputy CME of the newly formed London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), under George Hughes and became CME in October 1925. He was also invited to serve on the Government Bridge Stress Committee investigating stresses in railway-bridges, especially as regards the effects of moving loads

Along with Anderson, Fowler was responsible for the adoption by the LMS of the Midland&#x27;s small engine policy. Various Midland standard types were built by the LMS, including the 4P Midland Compound 4-4-0, the 2P 4-4-0, the 4F 0-6-0, and the 3F 0-6-0T. The small engine policy resulted in frequent double-heading, as the locomotives were not powerful enough to cope with loads, and thus increased expense. Standardisation also left these standard locomotives with short-travel valves and small axle boxes, the former leading to inefficiency and the latter to frequent hot axle boxes.

In 1928, the LMS introduced the &quot;Royal Scot&quot; 4-6-0 express passenger locomotive, based on the SR Lord Nelson Class.

In another departure from the small engine policy, several 2-6-0+0-6-2 Beyer-Garratts were acquired for the Toton-Brent coal trains. However, interference from Derby meant that the locomotives received standard small axle-boxes and short-travel valves, with the result that they were poor performers.

Fowler was not a hands-on engineer in the mould of George Jackson Churchward. Although (as was traditional) designs produced during his tenure were credited to him as &quot;Fowler&quot; locomotives, the majority of the work was done by his staff, with minimal personal involvement from Fowler. An analogy may be made with his successor Sir William Stanier&#x27;s Princess Coronation (Duchess) class, which was largely designed by LMS draughtsmen while Stanier was out of the country, although Stanier was more deeply involved in other designs during his tenure.

In 1930, Fowler became President of the Whitworth Society as successor to Mr. F. H. Livens, J.P.

Fowler retired in 1933, Ernest Lemon initially taking over as CME for a short period before William Stanier was head-hunted into the job from the Great Western Railway. Stanier was to reform LMS locomotive policy.

Fowler died on 14 October 1938 at his home, Spondon Hall (now demolished), Derby. He was buried in the Nottingham Road Cemetery, Chaddesden, Derby.

<text>1503 3AK was a popular music radio station dating back to the 1930s. Today, the station ceases to exist. It was sold in the 2000s several times, switched to 1116AM frequency and eventually sold to current owners Sports and Entertainment Network SEN 1116. A number of unusual events and precedents throughout the station&#x27;s history make its story of interest.

These include:
* In lieu of a &quot;C&quot; class licence, the granting of a &quot;B&quot; class licence in 1931, but with limiting conditions including: a position on the dial that could not be picked up by most contemporary radio sets; only allowed to broadcast when other Melbourne commercial stations were off the air, that is, most of the time only at night; limited power.
* The founder of the station was George Palmer, the father of Clive Palmer.
* The sharing of its wavelength with 2BS Bathurst, a station that was comparatively close geographically, thus causing interference problems.
* From 1954, permitted to broadcast during daylight hours, but only when its signal was perceived not to interfere with that of 2BS.
* Purchased in 1961 by Australian Consolidated Press and thus became sister station of GTV-9. Most high-profile GTV personalities also broadcast on 3AK.
* When some FM licences were auctioned off to existing AM stations in 1989, 3AK became one of the two successful Melbourne bidders, but the station did not take up the offer because of ownership changes.
* In 1990, purchased by Peter Corso. 3AK thus became an Italian language station for some years.
* In late 2003 the 3AK license was leased to Sports Entertainment Network and from January 2004 it became a 24-hour sports station, using the on-air name SEN whilst having to retain 3AK as its official callsign.

==History==

===Early years===
3AK commenced broadcasting on 29 November 1931, the fourth commercial radio station in Melbourne after 3UZ, 3DB and 3KZ.

The station&#x27;s call-sign came from the name of its operating company, the Akron Broadcasting Company. The owner of the Akron Tyre Co and of 3AK was George Palmer, the father of Clive Palmer.

At the time of its formation there were three types of broadcasters in Australia, A Class stations (most of which later evolved into the Australian Broadcasting Corporation); B Class stations, which are now known as commercial stations; amateurs. There were also government plans for a set of C class stations which were intended to be used by businesses to exclusively advertise their products. However it was decided not to proceed with this type of license before 3AK was actually granted its licence. Akron and the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department had originally discussed the issuance of such a license, but in lieu, a B Class licence with a number of restrictions, was issued to Akron.

From the outset, 3AK was only permitted to broadcast for limited hours when other Melbourne stations were off the air. 3AK originally broadcast from 11.30 pm to 2.00 am daily; 5.00 to 7.00 am Monday-Saturday; 1.00 to 2.00 pm Saturday; 12.30 to 2.30 pm Sunday. The three hours of weekend afternoon broadcasting were shared with amateurs on the MW (medium wave) band. 3AK also had limited power, which although frequently altered was usually about 20% of that given to other B Class stations in Melbourne. 3AK&#x27;s wavelength of 1500 KC could also be seen as a third limiting factor - it was at the very end of most contemporary radio dials; there were still some radio sets that were unable to receive it.

Most of 3AK&#x27;s early broadcasts consisted of live concerts from its studio in Queen Street. These were provided free of charge by a number of progressive Melbourne music teachers who believed that radio would help promote both them and their students. These concerts were occasionally interspersed with broadcasts of recordings (both 78 rpm/80 rpm gramophone records and piano rolls).

===Melbourne Broadcasters===
On 2 May 1934, the name of the company was changed to Melbourne Broadcasters Pty Ltd, a name that persisted throughout many major changes of management and was still being used as late as the 1980s. At this time Palmer changed the style of the station by introducing a format that mainly consisted of &quot;dance music&quot;, then very popular.

A listing of all Melbourne radio announcers published in February 1936 shows that George Palmer gave himself announcing duties, as well as managing the station. He was assisted by only two other announcers, F Bibby and T Lelliott. This small announcing staff puts 3AK&#x27;s lowly status in the 1930s and 1940s into context - the same list of Melbourne announcers shows that each of the five other commercial stations had either nine or 10 announcers each and the ABC is shown as employing 13 announcers in Melbourne to cover its two local stations (although this would have been supplemented by interstate announcers, because of the number of relays that were then taken).

In 1937 3AK was allowed to extend its hours of broadcast to 11.30 pm-7.00 am, however the station still closed at 3.00 am on Sundays. It still broadcast for three hours on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, even though amateurs were no longer permitted to do so after 1939. 3AK&#x27;s hours of broadcast remained unaltered until 1954.

2BS Bathurst commenced broadcasting on 1 January 1937. Because of 3AK&#x27;s low power, 2BS was given the same wavelength (1500 kHz) and, within a few years, both stations suffered from interference during the few hours when they were simultaneously on the air.

One of 3AK&#x27;s major personalities in the late 1930s/early 1940s was Alf Andrew who began broadcasting from 3AK in March 1937. Although a controversial character, Andrew had been a pioneer broadcaster at 3LO, commencing there in 1925 before going to 3UZ and then 2UW and a few other stations.

During the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, the station&#x27;s slogan was &quot;3AK - The Voice of the Night&quot;. However, unsubstantiated rumours about both drunkenness and the poor wages of the staff led to some referring to the station as &quot;3AK - The Voice of the TIGHT&quot;.

In the 1930s, the postmaster general gave one station in the Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide markets a licence to broadcast 24 hours a day. Because 3AK broadcast at night, Melbourne did not get any such 24-hour licences until as late as 1 February 1954 when 3UZ, 3DB and 3XY all began continuous broadcasting. This was concurrent with 3AK changing its hours of broadcast (see below). Within six months 3XY had become Melbourne&#x27;s only 24-hour station.

In this same era, 3AK moved its studio from Queen Street to Bourke Street. By the 1950s it had again been resited and was to be found in the upper storey of a bank in Grey Street, St Kilda.

In the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, 3AK provided an alternative to country radio, then the accepted place to commence a broadcasting career, many of 3AK&#x27;s early staff going on to become well known at major stations, e.g. Stan Rofe, Mike Williamson, Hal Todd, John Worthy, John Eden and John Hart.

At the time very few stations had newsrooms and most relied on newspapers for their news. Due to its poor financial situation, 3AK is believed to have devised a novel system of getting its news – the station had a rope dangling from their studio into the adjoining lane-way and the first newspaper firm to tie their morning edition onto the rope had it read on air.

By the late 1940s, 3AK had been purchased by Mack&#x27;s Furnishing Company. At this stage, both of the directors, the station&#x27;s manager, Vernon Margetts and the studio manager Ray Benn held conservative Christian beliefs that were reflected in 3AK&#x27;s program schedule.

===1950s===
For many years, 3AK management had been lobbying the Postmaster General&#x27;s Department and, then, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for an increase to its permitted broadcasting hours. Eventually, 3AK was allowed to broadcast during those daylight hours when it was thought that it would not interfere with transmissions from 2BS. From 1 February 1954, 3AK was permitted to broadcast from 6.00 am to 7.00 pm daily. However, 2BS still experienced difficulties during the summer, and so, for 4 or 5 months per year, 3AK could not broadcast until 7.00 am, and had to close as early as 5.00 pm. Until the introduction of television in Australia in 1956, the peak hours for any radio station were 7.00 pm-10.00 pm, so 3AK was never able to take advantage of this peak listening period.

When 3AK became a &quot;daylight&quot; station, its very first breakfast team was Lennie Holmes and Shin Berinson. Holmes went on to become a well-known radio and television comedian. After changing his first name to Jim, Berinson became one of the most sought-after and well-paid voice-over men. The breakfast program was later compered by Lou Carr. Another notable announcer during that era was Graham Madison.

===1960s===
In the early 1960s Australian Consolidated Press (ACP), owned by the Packer family, took over both television station GTV-9 and, a little later, 3AK. 3AK moved from its small St. Kilda studio into GTV-9&#x27;s &quot;Television City&quot; premises at Bendigo Street, Richmond, broadcasting a revised format from Easter Monday, 3 April 1961. GTV&#x27;s major television personalities were forced to broadcast from 3AK. Therefore, overnight, 3AK changed from a station with a young and virtually unknown announcing staff, to one featuring some of Australia&#x27;s best-known television personalities, including Philip Brady, Geoff Corke, Tommy Hanlon Jr., Geoff Hiscock, Graham Kennedy, Jack Little, Bert Newton, Eric Pearce, Brian Taylor, Hal Todd, Eric Welch, Arthur Young and Frank Zepter. In talking about the use of high-profile celebrities on 3AK, Philip Brady is quoted as saying: &quot;They expected us to do it for nothing&quot;. Even so, Philip Brady was one of the few GTV personalities without previous radio experience. Despite his claim that he had always loved radio, his first job in the media was with GTV, as from 1958.

Frank Zepter was actually more of a GTV-9 backroom person than a TV personality. He presented a weekend Italian language program on 3AK. Arthur Young was also heard on 3AK at weekends - he was the leader of GTV-9&#x27;s studio orchestra and presented a classical music program on 3AK. (This was an era when commercial radio stations were easing out of broadcasting classical music, but a small amount of it was still usually considered de rigueur at weekends. Prior to the ACP takeover, 3AK had broadcast quite a bit of classical music.)

Former 3AK manager Bill Bowie resigned and formed his own radio/television school. Former 3AK announcers (Ron Alderton, Terry Calder, Peter Cavanagh, John Print) were redeployed with the GTV organisation; only the former chief announcer, Ron Alderton, retaining any on-air work at 3AK, albeit only at weekends. Alderton later made his name as a TV newsreader, particularly at ATV-0/10. Peter Cavanagh was to make a name for himself as a TV actor, particularly in a number of Hector Crawford Production&#x27;s police dramas.

During the mid-1960s, 3AK&#x27;s program format shifted to Top 40 music with the slogan &quot;The Good Guys&quot;.

ACP was always keen to solve the problem of transmission hours caused by 2BS and 3AK sharing the same wavelength. Technology in the form of a directional antenna (at 2BS) seemed to be the answer, but this small country station was deaf to ACP&#x27;s continuous requests, leading to ACP&#x27;s purchase of 2BS, allowing them to install such an antenna. By October 1968 permission which enabled 3AK to commence 24-hour transmission had been granted. 3AK officially launched 24-hour broadcasting at 7.00pm on Friday, 8 November 1968. The station&#x27;s first overnight announcer was Grantley Dee.

===1970s–1980s===

In the early 1970s &quot;The Good Guys&quot; slogan was replaced by &quot;Where No Wrinklys Fly&quot;. During this period there was a head-on battle for the lucrative Top 40 market between 3XY (managed by Rod Muir) and Rhett Walker&#x27;s 3AK. The fact that 3XY won the battle is reflected in 3AK&#x27;s rapid change from Top 40 to Beautiful music, a predecessor to today&#x27;s Easy listening music format. The last announcer to work under the &quot;Wrinkly&quot; format was Mike Nicholls. The last song played was Australian rock band Spectrum&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone&quot;.

The new format paid dividends for 3AK as it took it to the top of the ratings where it remained for over a decade. A feature of the early days of 3AK&#x27;s Beautiful Music format was that it stopped advertising the names of its on-air personalities, claiming that the format was important but not the announcers. (Sister Beautiful Music station 2CH [Sydney] had a similar policy.)

3AK continued with slight variations of a broadly easy listening sound well into the 1980s. Some changes were also made to the promotional aspects of the station. Use of the words &quot;Beautiful Music&quot; was finally discontinued after marketing research indicated that a high percentage of the male audience wasn&#x27;t entirely comfortable with the term. Around 1985, the playlist underwent a major update. Most of the instrumental cover versions of Top 40 vocal hits which had always been a key component of the format were abruptly deleted and substituted with &quot;original songs by the original artists&quot;. The revamp led to the establishment of a more mainstream soft gold type of sound. However, despite this successful transformation and solid ratings, another much more dramatic change took place early in the following year when the station went adult contemporary. Ratings plummeted as rival station 3MP decided to pick up the Easy Listening concept and the relevant audience simply switched from 3AK to 3MP.

In 1986, after just one disastrous ratings period, 3AK and Sydney&#x27;s 2UE embarked on a shared talk-back format, called the CBC Network, which featured selected Melbourne and Sydney-based programs being broadcast across both stations. 3AK&#x27;s weekday breakfast shift with John Blackman remained a Melbourne only concern. Other programs being produced at the station were presented by well-known local personalities such as Ernie Sigley, Wendy Harmer, Jane Clifton, Fabian Datner, David Lentin and Adam Joseph. The experiment was yet another short-lived failure.

CBC was not a success, in part because many considered the format to be Sydney-centric. 
In 1987, Kerry Packer sold all of ACP&#x27;s radio and television interests to Alan Bond for A$1 billion. 3AK was included in the deal, even though Bond made no secret of the fact that he wanted the TV stations but was not interested in radio. Because of Bond&#x27;s insecure financial position, in 1990 Packer was able to buy back the Nine Network for a fraction of what he had sold it for. By this time, Bond had already sold 3AK.

===Light and Easy 3AK, 1987-1988===

In 1987, 1503 3AK switched back to music, and became Light and Easy 3AK, under Station Manager Peter Sinclair and PD Ed Breslin. The station was modelled on KOST FM Los Angeles. At the time 3AK was rating 1.4 and increased to a 4.9 share under the Light Hits format by mid 1988.

The on-air line-up at that time in 1987 at their studio in Channel 9 Richmond, consisted of:
Other announcers to join the station included Ken Lane and Steve Goode. News readers were David Armstrong, Michelle Alexandrovics and Peter Blinkensop.

===Talk 3AK 1989-90 years===

From mid 1989 to 1990, 3AK again become a purely talk format station with such high-profile names as Darren James (with Bruce Mansfield as &quot;Uncle Roy&quot;), Margaret Peacock, Don Chipp, Peter O&#x27;Callaghan (a former 3XY and EON FM DJ), Keith McGowan and Bill Howie (a former 3AK program director).

This period also saw the introduction of regular Saturday broadcasts of VFL (now AFL) with a football team headed by Graham Dawson.

In 1989 the federal government invited bids from all capital city AM commercial radio stations for a number of FM licences. Six of the seven Melbourne commercial AM stations bid for the two licences being offered in their market. (3AW was the only station that didn&#x27;t bid, on the grounds that its mature adult audience were not really FM listeners.) The two highest bidders were 3KZ with a record bid amongst all Australia-wide bidders of A$32 million, and 3AK with a bid of $22 million. Because of the dire financial position of Alan Bond (he was soon to be declared bankrupt), 3AK defaulted on the payment for its FM licence, which then went to the third highest Melbourne bidder, 3TT who paid only $11 million.

===1990s===
In 1990 the station was sold to Italian businessman Peter Corso who sacked most of its workforce in preparation to relaunch 3AK as Australia&#x27;s first commercial Italian-language radio station. There was a brief transition period whilst Corso was preparing his Italian format during which Beautiful Music was played continuously without any advertisements, studio announcements, news broadcasts, etc., but interspersed with recorded announcements about the starting dates for the Italian broadcasts. Nevertheless, the station was not able to get out of its obligations to broadcast the football and, so, at 12 noon on Saturdays football was still broadcast, both during this transition period and for the rest of the season.

Only two former 3AK employees, technician Ralph Knight and producer Warren Koglin were to be rehired by the new owner. 3AK continued to broadcast from within the GTV9 complex for about 12 months, before moving to new studios at West Melbourne.

At one stage, Corso contemplated moving away from the unsuccessful Italian format and was in talks with Bert Newton and his partner to sub-lease the station and provide an old-fashioned personality format. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal knocked back the application, firstly on the grounds that it could not allow the leasing of stations, and secondly because of questions raised as to the suitability of Newton&#x27;s partner. The former reason is interesting in the light of 3AK/SEN&#x27;s present situation.

The Italian format continued until 1994 when Corso sold the station to Southern Cross Broadcasting who took the station back to easy-listening music.

Corso was keen to sell 3AK because he had just obtained one of the first of the new narrowcast licences then being offered by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Therefore, 3AK&#x27;s Italian programming was transferred to the new narrow-cast station, 3BM, which transmitted from 1116 KC (ironically a wavelength that was later to be used by 3AK itself).

By 1996, Southern Cross had found itself owning four radio stations in Melbourne; 3AW, 3AK, 3EE, 3MP; whereas the legal limit was two stations in a single market. 3AK was sold to a Christian organisation, Fusion Media, who switched the format to a mixture of talk-back and magazine programs and easy listening music. The station was moved to studios on St Kilda Road that had originally been built for 3EE. It later moved again to Swan Street, Richmond.

===Final years===
After more years of low ratings and financial troubles, 3AK was sold again, to a small media and data company Data and Commerce Limited (DCL). In 2001, DCL transferred 3AK from 1503 kHz to 1116 kHz and relaunched 3AK once again as a talk back station in direct competition to top rating stations 3AW and ABC Radio Melbourne.

Controversial radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch took over 3AK&#x27;s morning time-slot after twelve months as evening presenter at 3AW. A former Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, was also a presenter.

===Demise===
Some unusual programming decisions and lack of promotion led to 3AK failing to lift from the bottom of the ratings ladder. In late 2003, DCL announced it had leased the running of radio 3AK to a new organisation Sports Entertainment Network (SEN) which converted 3AK to a 24-hour sport radio station. In January 2004, 3AK became known on-air as SEN 1116.

==SEN==

While initially, ratings were steadily rising, the station&#x27;s financial position took a turn for the worse in early 2005, with several employees, including Dermott Brereton, Mark Doran and Robert Shaw not being paid. This eventually led to Brereton walking out on the station. This financial situation could not have come at a worse time, since SEN had recently begun broadcasting into Adelaide. Adelaide broadcasts were short-lived because of the poor financial situation and the station&#x27;s heavy Melbourne focus.

In 2006 it was announced that SEN had acquired rights to broadcast five Australian Football League matches per weekend.

<doc id="569315" wikidata="Q408050" url="?curid=569315" title="Dimethyl ether">
<text>Dimethyl ether (DME; also known as methoxymethane) is the organic compound with the formula CH3OCH3, 
(sometimes ambiguously simplified to C2H6O as it is an isomer of ethanol). The simplest ether, it is a colorless gas that is a useful precursor to other organic compounds and an aerosol propellant that is currently being demonstrated for use in a variety of fuel applications.

Dimethyl ether was first synthesised by Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Péligot in 1835 by distillation of methanol and sulfuric acid.

==Production==
Approximately 50,000 tons were produced in 1985 in Western Europe by dehydration of methanol:
The required methanol is obtained from synthesis gas (syngas). Other possible improvements call for a dual catalyst system that permits both methanol synthesis and dehydration in the same process unit, with no methanol isolation and purification.
Both the one-step and two-step processes above are commercially available. The two-step process is relatively simple and start-up costs are relatively low. A one-step liquid-phase process is in development.

===From biomass===
Dimethyl ether is a synthetic second generation biofuel (BioDME), which can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass. The EU is considering BioDME in its potential biofuel mix in 2030; It can also be made from biogas or methane from animal, food, and agricultural waste, or even from shale gas or natural gas.

The Volvo Group is the coordinator for the European Community Seventh Framework Programme project BioDME where Chemrec&#x27;s BioDME pilot plant is based on black liquor gasification in Piteå, Sweden.

==Applications==
The largest use of dimethyl ether is as the feedstock for the production of the methylating agent, dimethyl sulfate, which entails its reaction with sulfur trioxide:
Dimethyl ether can also be converted into acetic acid using carbonylation technology related to the Monsanto acetic acid process:

===Laboratory reagent and solvent===
Dimethyl ether is a low-temperature solvent and extraction agent, applicable to specialised laboratory procedures. Its usefulness is limited by its low boiling point (), but the same property facilitates its removal from reaction mixtures. Dimethyl ether is the precursor to the useful alkylating agent, trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate.

===Niche applications===
A mixture of dimethyl ether and propane is used in some over-the-counter &quot;freeze spray&quot; products to treat warts by freezing them. In this role, it has supplanted halocarbon compounds (Freon).

Dimethyl ether is also a component of certain high temperature &quot;Map-Pro&quot; blowtorch gas blends, supplanting the use of methyl acetylene and propadiene mixtures.

Dimethyl ether is also used as a propellant in aerosol products. Such products include hair spray, bug spray and some aerosol glue products.

==Research==
===Fuel===

A potentially major use of dimethyl ether is as substitute for propane in LPG used as fuel in household and industry. Dimethyl ether can also be used as a blendstock in propane autogas.

It is also a promising fuel in diesel engines, and gas turbines. For diesel engines, an advantage is the high cetane number of 55, compared to that of diesel fuel from petroleum, which is 40–53. Only moderate modifications are needed to convert a diesel engine to burn dimethyl ether. The simplicity of this short carbon chain compound leads to very low emissions of particulate matter during combustion. For these reasons as well as being sulfur-free, dimethyl ether meets even the most stringent emission regulations in Europe (EURO5), U.S. (U.S. 2010), and Japan (2009 Japan).

At the European Shell Eco Marathon, an unofficial World Championship for mileage, vehicle running on 100 % dimethyl ether drove 589 km/L (169.8 cm3/100 km), fuel equivalent to gasoline with a 50 cm3 displacement 2-stroke engine. As well as winning they beat the old standing record of 306 km/liter (326.8 cm3/100 km), set by the same team in 2007.

To study the dimethyl ether for the combustion process a chemical kinetic mechanism is required which can be used for Computational fluid dynamics calculation.

=== Refrigerant ===
Dimethyl ether is a refrigerant with ASHRAE refrigerant designation R-E170. It is also used in refrigerant blends with e.g. ammonia, carbon dioxide, butane and propene.
Dimethyl ether was the first refrigerant. In 1876, the French engineer Charles Tellier bought the ex-Elder-Dempster a 690 tons cargo ship &quot;Eboe&quot; and fitted a methyl-ether refrigerating plant of his design. The ship was renamed &quot;Le Frigorifique&quot; and successfully imported a cargo of refrigerated meat from Argentina. However the machinery could be improved and in 1877 another refrigerated ship called &quot;Paraguay&quot; with a refrigerating plant improved by Ferdinand Carré was put into service on the South American run.

==Safety==
Unlike other alkyl ethers, dimethyl ether resists autoxidation. Dimethyl ether is also relatively non-toxic, although it is highly flammable. On July 28, 1948, a BASF factory in Ludwigshafen suffered an explosion after 30 tonnes of dimethyl ether leaked from a tank and ignited in the air. 200 people died, and a third of the industrial plant was destroyed.

<text>The Radical Party of the Left (, PRG) is a social-liberal political party in France. A party in the Radical tradition, since 1972 the PRG has been a close ally of the major party of the centre-left in France, the Socialist Party (, PS). After the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, negotiations to merge the PRG with the Radical Party (from which the PRG emerged in 1972) began and the refounding congress to reunite the parties into the Radical Movement was held on 9 and 10 December 2017. However, a faction of ex-PRG members, including its last president Sylvia Pinel, split from the Radical Movement in February 2019 due to its expected alliance with La République En Marche in the European elections and resurrected the PRG.

== History ==
The party was formed in 1972 by a split from the Republican, Radical, and Radical-Socialist Party, once the dominant party of the French Left. It was founded by Radicals who opposed Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber&#x27;s centrist direction. They chose to join the Union of the Left and agreed to the Common Programme signed by the Socialist Party (PS) and the French Communist Party (PCF). At that time, the party was known as the Movement of the Radical Socialist Left (, MGRS), then as the Movement of Radicals of the Left (, MRG) after 1973.

Led by Robert Fabre during the 1970s, the party was the third partner of the Union of the Left. Nevertheless, its electoral influence did not compare with those of its two allies, which competed for the leadership over the left. Robert Fabre sought to attract left-wing Gaullists to the party and gradually became close to President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, who nominated him as Mediator of the Republic in 1978. He and his followers were excluded from the party by those who strongly supported the alliance with the PS.

Michel Crépeau was nominated by the party for the 1981 presidential election and obtained a disappointing 2.09% in the first round. He and his party in the runoff endorsed PS candidate François Mitterrand, who eventually won. The MRG won 14 seats in the subsequent 1981 legislative election and participated in PS-led governments between 1981 and 1986 and again between 1988 and 1993.

In the 1984 European elections, the MRG formed a common list with Brice Lalonde&#x27;s environmentalists and Olivier Stirn, a centre-right deputy. The list styled as the Radical and Ecologist Agreement won 3.32%, but no seats. The party resumed its customary alliance with the PS in the 1986 legislative election and supported President Mitterrand&#x27;s 1988 reelection bid by the first round.

At the beginning of the 1990s, under the leadership of the popular businessman Bernard Tapie the party benefited from an ephemeral upswing in its popularity while the governing SP was in disarray. The list led by Tapie won 12.03% and 13 seats of the votes in the 1994 European Parliament election. However, Tapie retired from politics due to his legal problems and the party, renamed the Radical Socialist Party (, PRS), returned to its lowest ebb.

After the Radical Party opened legal proceedings against the PRS, it was forced to change its name to the Radical Party of the Left (, PRG). Between 1997 and 2002, it was a junior partner in Lionel Jospin&#x27;s Plural Left coalition government. In the 2002 presidential election, the PRG nominated its own candidate, former MEP and French Guiana deputy Christiane Taubira, for the first time since 1981. However, some members of the party including Émile Zuccarelli and PRG senator Nicolas Alfonsi supported Jean-Pierre Chevènement&#x27;s candidacy. Taubira won 2.32% of the vote. Taubira gave her name to the 2001 law which declared the Atlantic slave trade a crime against humanity.

In the 2007 presidential election, while the party supported the PS candidate Ségolène Royal, Bernard Tapie, who had been a leading figure in the PRG, supported Nicolas Sarkozy. In the 2007 legislative election, the party won eight seats, including a seat in French Guiana (Taubira) and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon.

The party split on Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s constitutional reforms in 2008. Six deputies (Gérard Charasse, Paul Giacobbi, Annick Girardin, Joël Giraud, Dominique Orliac and Sylvia Pinel) and three senators (Jean-Michel Baylet, André Boyer and François Vendasi) opted to vote in favour, hence allowing for its passage.

The PRG&#x27;s then-president Jean-Michel Baylet ran in the 2011 SP presidential primaries, the only non-PS candidate in the field, but was placed last with only 0.64% of the vote in the primary. The PRG supported François Hollande, the eventual winner of the primaries and the 2012 presidential election. In the 2012 legislative election, the PRG won 12 seats. With four additional members, it formed its own parliamentary group in the National Assembly, the Radical, Republican, Democratic and Progressive group.

Although the PRG remained a close and loyal ally of the PS, it has also cooperated with the small Ecology Generation (GE) party since December 2011.

In the 2014 European elections, the party received 13.98% of the vote on a joint list with the PS, electing one MEP Virginie Rozière, who joined the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) group with PS MEPs.

In the 2017 SP presidential primary, PRG candidate Sylvia Pinel received 2% of the vote in the first round election held on 22 January 2017. In the 2017 French legislative election, the party only re-elected three MPs; Annick Girardin, Jeanine Dubié and Sylvia Pinel.

In 2019, the party was relaunched.

The party supported Christiane Taubira in the 2022 French presidential election.

Following the 2022 French legislative election, the party&#x27;s only deputy is Olivier Falorni representing Charente-Maritime&#x27;s 1st constituency. He was elected in 2022 with 66.11% of the (second-round) vote in that constituency, and re-elected in 2024 with 74.71%. The PRG was the only centre-left party on the French mainland with representation in the National Assembly to refuse to join the leftist electoral coalition NUPES, headed by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, and in 2024 it formed part of Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s Ensemble coalition.

== Ideology ==
The PRG advocates social liberalism, classical radicalism, secularism to its French extent known as &quot;laïcité&quot;, progressivism, European federalism, and individual freedom; it differs from the social democrats of the Socialist Party mainly by its strong attachment to private property.

The party was a member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party before 2012.

== Factions ==
Under Baylet, the PRG&#x27;s party line was centre-left, socially liberal and pro-European. Nevertheless, there were internal divisions in the party. Former cabinet minister and former deputy Émile Zuccarelli is a left-wing republican who strongly opposed Corsican nationalism and supported the no vote in the 2005 European constitutional referendum, positions much closer to Jean-Pierre Chevènement&#x27;s Citizen and Republican Movement (MRC). Similarly, Christiane Taubira supported the no vote in 2005 and endorsed Arnaud Montebourg rather than Baylet in the 2011 primary.

== Elected officials ==
* Current Deputies: Olivier Falorni (Charente-Maritime 1)
* Former Ministers: Annick Girardin, Jacques Mézard
* Former Deputies: Stéphane Claireaux (Saint Pierre et Miquelon), Jeanine Dubié (Hautes-Pyrénées), Sylvia Pinel (Tarn-et-Garonne)
* Senators (RDSE group): Joseph Castelli (Haute-Corse), Yvon Collin (Tarn-et-Garonne), Philippe Esnol (Yvelines), François Fortassin (Hautes-Pyrénées), Françoise Laborde (Haute-Garonne), Jacques Mézard (Cantal), Jean-Claude Requier (Lot)

== Popular support ==
The PRG remained rather weak on its own electorally, averaging around 2% of the vote (2002 presidential candidate Christiane Taubira won 2.32% of the vote); which explains why the party depended on its stronger ally, the PS for support and parliamentary representation. Almost all of the party&#x27;s deputies and local officials were elected with no official PS opposition. It retained some support among middle class voters and in traditional Radical areas in the South West.

The major exception was in Corsica, where the party was historically the largest party on the non-nationalist French Left and remains so to its time of dissolution due to a tradition of political dynasties (such as the Giacobbi family) and the weak infrastructure of the PS on the island. Paul Giacobbi represented Haute-Corse in the National Assembly until he stood down at the 2017 elections (Émile Zuccarelli, an internal rival of Giacobbi and current mayor of Bastia, also represented the island in Paris until his 2007 defeat) and Senators Nicolas Alfonsi and François Vendasi represented the Corsican PRG in the Senate. Giacobbi is also President of the General Council of Haute-Corse.

In metropolitan France, the PRG was able to sustain a long-lasting Radical tradition dating back to the French Third Republic, most notably in the southwest or departments such as the Eure-et-Loir and Eure.

The party was represented overseas in French Guiana by Taubira&#x27;s Walwari, one of the major parties of the local left.

<text>J. Charles (Chuck) Guité (born 1943 or 1944 in Dugas, Quebec, on the Gaspé peninsula), raised in Campbellton, New Brunswick, is a former Canadian civil servant, appointed by Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government. He held his position under the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien and was in charge of the federal sponsorship program from 1996 to 1999.

On April 2, 2004, previously confidential testimony from a 2002 inquiry into suspicious Groupaction contracts was made public. In it, Guité admits to having bent the rules in his handling of the advertising contracts but defends his actions as excusable given the circumstances, saying, &quot;We were basically at war trying to save the country... When you&#x27;re at war, you drop the book and the rules and you don&#x27;t give your plan to the opposition.&quot;

He became head of federal government advertising in the 1980s, and left the public service in 1999.

On June 6, 2006, a jury in Montreal found Guité guilty on all five counts of defrauding the Federal Government. On June 19, he was sentenced to 42 months in jail. He appealed his conviction and sentence and both appeals were dismissed in 2008. Since he was granted bail pending appeal, his 42-month sentence did not begin to run until 2008.

On December 23, 2008 the National Parole Board authorized Guité&#x27;s conditional release making him eligible for day parole on February 15, 2009 and full parole on September 16, 2009. Under Canadian law, first time non-violent offenders are allowed an accelerated review and a possible early release.

<text>Loma is an unincorporated town, post office, and census-designated place (CDP) located in and governed by Mesa County, Colorado, United States. It is part of the Grand Junction, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Loma post office has the ZIP Code 81524. At the 2020 census, the population of the Loma CDP was 1,314.

==History==
The name &quot;Loma&quot; is derived from a Spanish word meaning &quot;small hill&quot;.

The area was first inhabited by the Ute people, who had left by 1881.

In 1882, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad completed a narrow-gauge railroad through Loma. A standard-gauge track was installed in 1890.

Homesteaders began arriving in Loma in the late 1880s. Agriculture became a dominant feature in Loma&#x27;s early economy, enabled by the completion of the Kiefer Extension irrigation canal in 1899. The railway provided easy shipment of crops and livestock to larger cities like Denver and Salt Lake City.

The first school was established in the 1890s, and the two-story Loma School was constructed in 1910 from yellow brick, fired on the grounds. The brick school remained in use until 1982, when Loma Elementary School opened.

In 1901, the Colorado Sugar Company opened of land near Loma to settlers. Sugar beets were a primary crop, and beet production dominated Loma&#x27;s agriculture until the 1970s, when the Delta Sugar Beet factory closed. Potatoes were also grown by Loma farmers.

The Loma post office opened in 1905, and has continued in operation since.

In 1910, the church now known as Loma Community Church was built. It has often been referred to as &quot;The Church That Stayed&quot;. Virginia Donoho produced a 15,000 word history of the church by that same name in the early 1980s. In 1965 the building added indoor plumbing, a fellowship hall, a kitchen, and two bathrooms. In the late 1970s a small addition was built.

Verner Zevola Reed, known as &quot;The Colorado Millionaire&quot;&quot;, opened the Golden Hills ranch on of land he had purchased north of Loma in 1907. Reed intended on growing apples, and installed an underground irrigation system to water his orchards. In 1911, the Loma Canning and Preserving Company opened a canning factory in Loma to process the anticipated harvests. The endeavor was not a success, and the factory closed a few years later without ever reaching its capacity. Reed sold the Golden Hills Ranch in 1923.

A second irrigation canal called the Highline Canal was built through Loma in 1917, and led to significant economic growth and several bumper crops during the 1920s.

By 1923, Loma had a school, blacksmith, garage, railroad station, school, two-story hotel, shipping yard, post office, pool hall, two churches, two grocery stores, and many two-story homes.

During the Depression, the federal government relocated 32 families from the Dust Bowl to Loma.

A &quot;reading room&quot; was established in Loma in 1936 as part of an effort to provide rural citizens in Mesa County with free public library service. In 1938, the Loma Community Hall was erected, and was used for community meetings and social events. The hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

A uranium mine and mill were built near Loma in the 1940s. Small settlements such as Loma with uranium mines were called &quot;yellowcake towns&quot; because the uranium oxide they produced resembled cake mix.

In the 1950s, a pipeline was constructed along an abandoned Uintah Railway track to carry a mixture of crushed gilsonite ore and water from Bonanza, Utah, to Loma. The American Gilsonite Company owned the slurry line and built a plant in Loma, where the gilsonite was refined into gasoline, &quot;gilsapave&quot; paving tar, and briquettes used for aluminum refining. The plant was later purchased by Gary Refining.

In July 2015, the Colorado Department of Transportation installed Loma&#x27;s first signal light at the intersection of Highway 139 and Route 6.

Country Jam is a country music and camping festival in nearby Mack that has taken place since 1992.

==Geography==
Loma is located in northwestern Mesa County, northwest of Grand Junction, the Mesa county seat. U.S. Route 6 passes through the center of town, leading northwest to Mack and southeast to Fruita. Interstate 70 forms the southern edge of the Loma CDP, with access from Exit 15 (Colorado State Highway 139). Highway 139 leads north from Loma over Douglas Pass to Rangely. The Colorado River flows south of Loma.

Loma has been described as having:
A sense of openness that is created by farmsteads, viable agriculture, farm based businesses, small subdivisions, mixed housing types and lot sizes, single-lane farm roads, and two core villages [Loma and Mack] that are the focal points of the surrounding landscape.

<text>Constance Campbell Bennett (October 22, 1904 – July 24, 1965) was an American stage, film, radio, and television actress and producer. She was a major Hollywood star during the 1920s and 1930s; during the early 1930s, she was the highest-paid actress in Hollywood. Bennett frequently played society women, focusing on melodramas in the early 1930s and then taking more comedic roles in the late 1930s and 1940s. She is best remembered for her leading roles in &quot;What Price Hollywood?&quot; (1932), &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (1933), &quot;Topper&quot; (1937), &quot;Topper Takes a Trip&quot; (1938), and had a prominent supporting role in Greta Garbo&#x27;s last film, &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941). 

She was the daughter of stage and silent film star Richard Bennett, and the elder sister of actress Joan Bennett.

==Early life==

Bennett was born in New York City, the eldest of three daughters of actress Adrienne Morrison and actor Richard Bennett. Her younger sisters were actresses Joan Bennett and Barbara Bennett. All three girls attended the Chapin School in New York. 

==Career==
After some time spent in a convent, Bennett entered acting, Constance, the first Bennett sister to enter motion pictures, appeared in New York–produced silent movies before a meeting with Samuel Goldwyn led to her Hollywood debut in &quot;Cytherea&quot; (1924). She abandoned a career in silent films for marriage to Philip Plant in 1925 but resumed her film career after their divorce in 1929, at the advent of talking pictures.

In the early 1930s, Bennett was frequently among the top actresses named in audience popularity and box-office polls. In 1931, a short-lived contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer earned her $300,000 for two movies which included &quot;The Easiest Way&quot; and made her one of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood. Warner Brothers paid her the all-time high salary of $30,000 a week for &quot;Bought!&quot; in 1931. Richard Bennett, her father, was also cast in this film.
The next year she moved to RKO, where she acted in &quot;What Price Hollywood?&quot; (1932), directed by George Cukor, a behind-the-scenes looks at the Hollywood studio system, in which she portrayed waitress Mary Evans, who becomes a movie star. Lowell Sherman co-starred as the film director who discovers her, and Neil Hamilton as the wealthy playboy she marries who later divorces her. The film &quot;Morning Glory&quot; had been written with Bennett in mind for the lead role, but producer Pandro S. Berman gave the role to Katharine Hepburn, who won an Academy Award for her performance. 

During her time at RKO, Bennett briefly became the highest-paid actress in Hollywood. RKO controlled the careers of actresses Ann Harding and Helen Twelvetrees in a similar manner, hoping to duplicate Bennett&#x27;s success. 

Bennett next showed her versatility in the likes of &quot;Our Betters&quot; (1933), writer/director Gregory La Cava&#x27;s &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (1933) with Pert Kelton, &quot;After Tonight&quot; (1933, co-starring with future husband Gilbert Roland), &quot;The Affairs of Cellini&quot; (1934), &quot;After Office Hours&quot; (1935) with Clark Gable, &quot;Topper&quot; (1937, as Marian Kerby opposite Cary Grant, a role she repeated in the 1939 sequel, &quot;Topper Takes a Trip&quot;), the madcap family comedy &quot;Merrily We Live&quot; (1938) and &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941, supporting Greta Garbo).

By the 1940s, Bennett was working less frequently in film but was in demand in both radio and theatre. She had her own program, &quot;Constance Bennett Calls on You&quot;, on ABC radio in 1945–1946. In 1945–1946, she hosted &quot;The Constance Bennett Show&quot; on ABC Radio.

She had a major supporting role in &quot;The Unsuspected&quot; (1947), in which she played Jane Moynihan, the program director who helps prove that radio host Victor Grandison (Claude Rains) is guilty of murder. In the 1950s, &quot;As Young as You Feel&quot; (1951) found her playing opposite Marilyn Monroe. Bennett played herself in a cameo in &quot;It Should Happen to You&quot; (1954). In 1957–1958, she toured the United States in the title role of &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;. Bennett made her final screen appearance in the 1965 film &quot;Madame X&quot; (released posthumously in 1966), as the blackmailing mother-in-law.

==Personal life==

Bennett was married five times and had three children. 

===Chester Hirst Moorehead===
On June 15, 1921, Bennett eloped with Chester Hirst Moorehead of Chicago, a student at the University of Virginia who was the son of oral surgeon, Frederick Moorehead. They were married by a justice of the peace in Greenwich, Connecticut. Bennett was 16 at the time. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article reporting the elopement observed: &quot;The parents of Miss Bennett were opposed to their marriage at this time solely on account of their youth.&quot; The marriage was annulled in 1923.

===Philip Morgan Plant===
Bennett&#x27;s next serious relationship was with millionaire socialite Philip Morgan Plant. Her parents planned a cruise to Europe, taking Constance with them, to separate the couple. As the ship was preparing to leave port, however, the Bennetts saw Plant and his parents boarding, too. A contemporary newspaper article reported, &quot;Now the little beauty and the heir to all the Plant millions were assured a week of the cosy intimacy which an ocean liner affords.&quot; In November 1925, the two eloped and were married in Greenwich, Connecticut, by the same justice of the peace who officiated at Bennett&#x27;s wedding to Moorehead. They divorced in a French court in 1929. 

In 1932, Bennett returned from Europe with a three-year-old child, whom she claimed to have adopted and named Peter Bennett Plant (born 1929). In 1942, however, during a battle over a large trust fund established to benefit any descendants of her former husband, Bennett announced that her adopted son actually was her natural child by Plant, born after the divorce and kept hidden to ensure that the child&#x27;s biological father did not get custody. During the court hearings, the actress told her former mother-in-law and her husband&#x27;s widow that &quot;if she got to the witness stand she would give a complete account of her life with Plant.&quot; The matter was settled out of court.

===Henri de la Falaise===
In 1931, Bennett made headlines when she married one of Gloria Swanson&#x27;s former husbands, Henri le Bailly, the Marquis de La Coudraye de La Falaise, a French nobleman and film director. She and de la Falaise founded Bennett Pictures Corp. and co-produced two films which were the Hollywood films shot in the two-strip Technicolor process, &quot;&quot; (1935) filmed on location in Bali, and &quot;Kilou the Killer Tiger&quot; (1936), filmed in Indochina. The couple divorced in Reno, Nevada in 1940.

===Gilbert Roland and John Theron Coulter===
Bennett&#x27;s fourth marriage was to actor Gilbert Roland. They were married in 1941 and had two daughters, Lorinda &quot;Lynda&quot; and Christina &quot;Gyl&quot;. They divorced in 1946, with Bennett winning custody of their children. Later that year, Bennett married for the fifth and final time to US Air Force Colonel John Theron Coulter. After her marriage, she concentrated her efforts on providing relief entertainment to US troops still stationed in Europe, winning military honors for her services. Bennett and Coulter remained married for the rest of her life. Bennett supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.
===Death===
Bennett died on July 24, 1965, aged 60. As the wife of John Theron Coulter, who had achieved the rank of brigadier general, she was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Coulter died in 1995 and was buried with her.

==Legacy==
Bennett has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the film industry. Her star is located at 6250 Hollywood Boulevard, a short distance from the star of her sister, Joan.

<text>Viridor Limited (from the Latin &#x27;to become green&#x27;) is a recycling, renewable energy and waste management company in the United Kingdom owned by KKR.

==History==
The company was formed in 1956 as Harrison Western Limited, later becoming Haul Waste Limited. Haul Waste became part of Pennon in 1993, and grew by purchasing companies in the waste collection and landfill disposal market.

In 1995 it bought Blue Circle Waste Management, bringing about South West Water&#x27;s name change to Pennon Group in 1998, and the merger of Haul Waste and Blue Circle Waste Management under Viridor. It subsequently acquired part of Churngold&#x27;s waste business in June 2003, Thames Waste Management in 2004, Somerset LAWDC Wyvern Waste in 2006, Grosvenor Waste Management and Skipaway Holdings in 2007, and Shore Recycling in 2008. Later in 2015 Viridor took over the collection side of Dorset based waste company Commercial Recycling.

Today the business is valued at around £4 billion, with recent acquisitions and growth focused on expanding the company&#x27;s recycling and energy from waste capacity. Viridor was awarded the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority&#x27;s Waste PFI contract, the largest waste and renewable energy contract in the UK.

On 12 August 2010, the company was featured on Channel 4 documentary &quot;Undercover Boss&quot;, in which Chief Executive Colin Drummond went undercover as a new recruit inside the company.

In March 2020, KKR agreed terms to buy Viridor in a £4.2 billion deal. The transaction was completed on 8 July 2020.

==Viridor Credits==
As part of the Landfill Communities Fund tax credit scheme, Viridor created the Viridor Credits scheme which in 2001 to distribute funds to communities for heritage and biodiversity projects. It reported £7.6m in grants in 2017/18.

<text>Richard Lewis (born 1969) is the former leader of two conservative Christian political parties in New Zealand, Destiny New Zealand and The Family Party. He led both these parties from their formation to deregistration.

Lewis was born in Auckland, New Zealand. At the age of twenty-two, he joined the New Zealand Police. He served as a police officer for eleven years. In 2001, he became the manager of Destiny Social Services, a branch of the Auckland-based Destiny Church. In 2003 Lewis was instrumental in the establishment of the Destiny New Zealand political party, which derived primarily from Destiny Church which is headed by Brian Tamaki.

The party went on to stand 42 candidates in the 2005 general election, and was one of only three parties to stand in all 7 Māori electorates. The party did not win any electorate seats and received 0.62% of the party vote, which did not meet the 5% threshold to achieve parliamentary representation. It was the highest polling party outside of parliament. Lewis himself stood as his party&#x27;s candidate for Manukau East and came third behind the two major party candidates from Labour and National with 1,111 votes (3.4%).

In 2007, Destiny New Zealand was disbanded, with Lewis instead becoming leader of the newly formed The Family Party.

However, The Family Party failed to gain access into parliament again in the 2008 election. Lewis, who stood as the candidate for Manurewa, gained only 514 votes. The party deregistered in April 2010.

<text>Herschel Island (; Inuvialuktun: ) is an island in the Beaufort Sea (part of the Arctic Ocean), which lies off the coast of Yukon in Canada, of which it is administratively a part. Part of the Arctic Archipelago, it is Yukon&#x27;s only large offshore island.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The earliest evidence of human occupation unearthed so far by archaeological investigations is that of the Thule people, dating to approximately 1000 years ago. These people are the ancestors of the present-day Inuvialuit. The Inuvialuktun word for Herschel Island is , which simply means &#x27;island&#x27;.

The first European to sight the island was explorer Sir John Franklin, who named it on 15 July 1826. It is not clear after whom the island was named. Franklin&#x27;s journal records states that he wished to honour the name Herschel, of which three persons are notable for their scientific accomplishments: Sir William Herschel, his sister Caroline Herschel, and his son Sir John Herschel.; At the time of Franklin&#x27;s explorations there were three Inuvialuit settlements on Herschel Island. Estimates of the number of people living on the island (and along the Yukon North Slope) at that time ranged from 200 to 2,000. The island was used as a base for hunting, fishing and whaling.

=== The whaling period ===

In the late 19th century, whalers discovered that the Beaufort Sea was one of the last refuges of the depleted bowhead whale, which was prized for its baleen (whalebone), blubber, and oil. Commercial bowhead hunting in the area began in 1889. In order for the short Arctic whaling season to be profitable, it was necessary to overwinter in the area. Herschel Island was found to have a good harbour for large whalers. In 1890 a Euro-American settlement was established at Pauline Cove. At the height of the Beaufort Sea whaling period (1893–94) the number of residents on the island was estimated at 1,500, making it the largest Yukon community at that time. Though several frame buildings had been constructed, most residents continued to live on the whalers.

In 1893, the Pacific Steam Whaling Company (PSW Co.) constructed a building called the Community House at Pauline Cove. With a recreation room, an office for the manager and storekeeper, and storage facilities, the Community House became the most prominent building on the island. In 1896 the company offered the house to the Anglican church, who used the building until 1906.

In 1903, Francis Joseph Fitzgerald was the first North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) officer assigned to the area, who later died in the famous &quot;Lost Patrol&quot;.

In 1911, the Royal North-West Mounted Police purchased all Herschel Island assets of the PSW Co. for $1,500. The Community House still stands, and is believed to be the oldest frame building in Yukon. It remains in excellent condition, and is now used as a park office and visitor centre.

=== Application of law against Indigenous population ===
In 1909, the first special constable was hired on Herschel Island. Generally, the cooperation of the Inuvialuit population, who worked as specials, and the general support the Mounted Police by the local population enabled the policing system on Herschel Island.

Canadian lawmen began to act in the area as arbiters of British justice and tended to be determined to apply their systems of law aggressively, as they felt they had been lenient in other regional murder trials. Members of the Inuvialuit population recollect a random application of law against the Indigenous population, including episodes of rape and assault by white police against Inuvialuit women. Inuvialuit women also recollect that white police would threaten them with prison time or hangings unless they were married to Inuvialuit men.

This period also represented the first Inuit tried and executed for murder under Canadian law. In December 1921, Corporal W.A. Doak, accompanied by Inuit members of the police, investigated some killings of Inuit by other Inuit on Kiillinnguyaq, formerly the Kent Peninsula. A short investigation, aided by community support, resulted in the arrest of Alikomiak (aged 16–19 years) and Tatamigana (unknown age). A third man, Ikalukpiak, had been arrested earlier and was grouped with the two other men, though they were not confined as a result of a lack of lock-up. On the night of 1 April 1922, Alikomiak shot the sleeping Doak in the leg. The next morning, he shot Otto Binder, a fur trader with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. On the return of the second member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who had been on patrol during the shootings, an unresisting Alikomiak was tied up and brought with the other Inuit to Herschel Island for trial. Testimony from Alikomiak suggested the murder of Doak was motivated by fear of abuse, while the attack against Binder was motivated by Alikomiak&#x27;s fear that on seeing Doak&#x27;s body, Binder would retaliate against him.

There were four trials of Alikomiak and Tatamigana which followed, all of which were brief and appeared predecided. The trial was a show trial, intended as a demonstration of force by Canadian law enforcement against the Inuit, as well as a demonstration to the world of Canada&#x27;s claims to sovereign rights in the Arctic. Herschel Island was chosen as the site for the trial because of its accessibility and because it was the only community along the Arctic coast that had significant buildings, a result of the whaling economy in the area. Alikomiak was eventually sentenced for killing whites, while Tatamigana was sentenced for killing an Inuit, and both were sentenced to hang. Some bishops and locals protested the sentences and recommended other punishments, particularly because of Alikomiak&#x27;s young age, though local newspapers tended to favour the verdict and the Canadian government refused to commute it.

=== Missionaries, police, and traders ===
Anglican missionary Isaac Stringer first visited Herschel Island in 1893. He returned with his wife in 1896, and ministered to the people there until his departure in 1901. Stringer and other missionaries attempted to build a church on the island, but were not successful. A mission house was constructed in 1916 by Reverend Whittaker. This building still stands, but is in poor condition.
In 1903, Francis Joseph Fitzgerald, an North-West Mounted Police Inspector visited Herschel Island. The following year, he and Constable Sutherland established a detachment on the island, which was at first based in two small sod huts. From 1910 to 1931 Herschel Island was subdistrict headquarters for the NWMP and, after 1920, the RCMP in the western part of the Canadian Arctic. Command was transferred to Aklavik in 1931, and Herschel Island was patrolled intermittently until 1948, when the detachment was reopened on a seasonal basis. On 16 February 1918, Herschel Island suffered its first loss of a police officer. Constable Alexander Lamont age 30, Badge Number 5548 Royal Northwest Mounted Police died of a duty-related illness. Constable Lamont died from typhoid fever while on Hershel Island, while attending to the needs of another victim of the disease.

On 14 July 1958, Herschel Island suffered another loss of a police officer. Constable Carl Lennart Sundell, aged 24 years, was stationed on board the RCMP supply schooner &quot;Herschel&quot; at the time of his death and died as a result of an accidental shooting. He was shot while boarding the vessel which was in a cradle onshore for repairs. The RCMP post was closed permanently in 1964.

In 1915 the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sent Mr. Christy Harding to Herschel Island to establish a post. Soon after his arrival he constructed a store, house, warehouse, and several other buildings. Business at the post was never lucrative. In 1937 the Bay closed its doors on the island, and its buildings were abandoned. None of them remain.

In 1926 the Northern Whaling and Trading Company, owned and operated by Christian Theodore Pedersen, constructed a store, warehouse and small shed on the island. These buildings still stand, though in recent years they have been moved as much as inland, away from the receding shoreline.

=== Modern developments ===
The island did see some renewed activity in the 1970s when it became a temporary safe harbour for oil-drilling ships. Its last permanent, year-round residents (the MacKenzie family) left in 1987. Inuvialuit still use the island seasonally for hunting, fishing, and as a place to camp while travelling.

In 1978, a land claims agreement was reached in principle between the Inuvialuit and the Government of Canada. By 1984, the Inuvialuit Final Agreement (IFA), which led to the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, was in place. In 1987, Qikiqtaruk Territorial Park was created by the Government of Yukon in accordance with the terms of the IFA. The Government of Yukon and the Inuvialuit share responsibility for planning, managing, and protecting Herschel Island&#x27;s natural and historic resources

== Geography ==

Herschel Island has an area of . It is approximately between shorelines, with a rolling tundra terrain that ranges in height from sea level to .

The island was created from sediments that were thrust up by a lobe of glacier ice from the Laurentide ice sheet emanating from the Mackenzie River valley and moving westward along the coastal plain approximately 30,000 years ago. There is no bedrock core to the island. The island is subject to very high rates of coastal erosion due to the ice-rich nature of the underlying permafrost, and its surface heaves and rolls down its own hillsides from the effects of frost creep and solifluction.

== Climate ==
Herschel Island has a dry-winter tundra climate (Koppen &quot;ETw&quot;) characterized by long, cold, dry winters and short, cool, moist summers. Strong steady winds are prevalent throughout the year. July is the warmest month, with a mean temperature of and a mean daytime high of , but can reach as high as . January temperatures average , but temperatures have been known to reach as low as .

From November to early June, Herschel Island is locked in ice. Located north of the Arctic Circle, Herschel Island enjoys the midnight sun every year between 19 May and 24 July. Polar night, when the sun does not appear above the horizon, lasts from 29 November to 14 January, but significant twilight is experienced for a few hours in the late morning and early afternoon during the latter period.

== Fish and marine mammals ==
The waters around Herschel Island are a haven for fish and marine mammals. The Mackenzie River flows into the Beaufort Sea southeast of the island. Its warm, nutrient-rich waters drift westward along the mainland shore as far as Herschel. Zooplankton feed on these nutrients, and are in turn eaten by larger fish, seals, and whales. Arctic cod, Arctic char, Pacific herring and Arctic flounder are all found in this area.

Whales travel past Herschel Island on their seasonal migration. Bowhead whales can still be seen from Herschel as they migrate westward to the Bering Sea in September, feeding on krill close to the surface. Beluga whales are also seen from the island during the open water period. Ringed seals are the most common marine mammals in this part of the Arctic, feeding on fish along the edges of the ice during the summer months.

The polar bear is a major predator of ringed seals. In summer they live along the edges of the pack ice near the island. In winter, a few female bears den on the island&#x27;s northern slopes.

== Land mammals ==
Small herds of Porcupine caribou (or Grant&#x27;s caribou, &quot;Rangifer tarandus grantii&quot;) are frequently found on the island in summer. Muskox, and grizzly bears are occasionally seen, crossing to Herschel from the mainland. Lemmings, tundra voles and Arctic shrews are common. Red and Arctic foxes are also known to den on the island. Natal Arctic fox dens are found each year on the island, usually one or two, but occasionally more. Red foxes also reproduce on the island but natal red fox dens are not observed every year.

== Birds ==
At least 94 bird species have been counted on Herschel Island, 40 of which breed there. The island hosts the largest colony of black guillemots in the western Arctic, nesting in the old Anglican mission house. Arctic terns, American golden plovers, and red-necked phalaropes make use of the tundra ponds and shingle beaches. Other birds that breed on the island include the common eider, rough-legged hawk, snow bunting, Lapland longspur, and redpoll.

== Vegetation ==
Herschel Island is situated in the Yukon Coastal Plain ecoregion. The vegetation of this ecoregion is described as Arctic tundra, with continuous ground cover and no trees present.

There are over 200 species of plants on Herschel Island, which occur in a diversity of habitats. Most of the island is composed of level to gently sloping stable uplands, vegetated by cottongrass, ground shrubs, and wildflowers.

From late June to early August, Herschel Island witnesses an explosion of colour. Its humid maritime climate during the growing season fosters a lush growth of tundra flowers, including vetches, louseworts, Arctic lupines, arnicas, and forget-me-nots.

== UNESCO site ==
Qikiqtaruk Territorial Park, together with Ivvavik National Park and Vuntut National Park (both on the Yukon mainland), is a leading contender to become Canada&#x27;s next World Heritage Site. The region is on Canada&#x27;s tentative list for a UNESCO nomination in both the cultural and natural categories.

== Climate change threats ==
In 2007 the UNESCO World Heritage Centre published a report called &quot;Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage&quot;. The report states that a decrease in sea ice, and consequent increase in coastal erosion, poses a serious threat to Herschel Island&#x27;s historic resources. The World Monuments Fund has placed Herschel Island on its &quot;100 Most Endangered Sites, 2008&quot; watch list, citing &quot;rising sea levels, eroding coastline and melting permafrost&quot; as imminent threats. Coastal erosion is up to per year in parts of the island&#x27;s coastline. There are several active slumps or retrogressive thaw slumps of considerable size along the south-eastern shore of the island and they have increased in abundance and size over the last fifty years. In summer 2024 alone, over 700 coastal landslides slumped parts of the island into the ocean.

<text>BBC Radio Norfolk is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Norfolk.

It broadcasts on FM, AM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at The Forum in Norwich.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 131,000 listeners and a 6.8% share as of December 2023.

==History==

BBC Local Radio originally launched in 1967 but it was not until more than a decade later that local radio in East Anglia was to become a reality. Therefore, the BBC&#x27;s only radio coverage of the East Anglia throughout this period was a regional weekday breakfast show opt-out from BBC Radio 4 called &quot;Roundabout East Anglia&quot;, plus five-minute summaries at lunchtime and teatime. It covered the same area as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Look East&quot; regional television news programme. Like &quot;Look East&quot;, &quot;Roundabout East Anglia&quot; also broadcast from BBC East&#x27;s regional headquarters at All Saint&#x27;s Green in Norwich.

The BBC&#x27;s desire to expand its local radio network was stalled in the late 1970s by a governmental review of local radio. However, when expansion was allowed once again, a policy existed whereby only one local station would launch at the same time in any one area so when it came to choosing whether Norfolk or Devon would receive a BBC or commercial station first, there was contention between the BBC and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) as to who would get which area. This was settled by the toss of a coin, with the BBC winning and choosing Norfolk.

BBC Radio Norfolk was the first BBC station in England to launch since 1973 when it went on air at 17:55 on 11 September 1980. The station&#x27;s first presenter on air was John Mountford and the launch was simulcast live on &quot;Look East&quot;. Mountford was one of several former &quot;Roundabout East Anglia&quot; personnel who transferred to the new station following that programme&#x27;s demise. From launch, the station broadcast stereo (though only to east Norfolk; the remainder of the county had to wait until 2005) and was the first BBC Local station to broadcast with stereo sound.

Initially, there was insufficient budget for a full schedule, with broadcasts at first restricted to a breakfast show, a two-hour show at midday and an extended 5pm news and sports bulletin. BBC Radio 2 was carried at all other times. There was, however, a full local service at weekends, when it was assumed more listeners would be available. After Keith Salmon took over as the station&#x27;s managing editor in 1982, full local programmes began on weekdays.

Originally, Radio Norfolk was at a former carpet showroom in Norfolk Tower on Surrey Street in Norwich and in June 2003 the station moved to The Forum in Norwich.

===Notable programmes and presenters===

Roy Waller presented a weekday afternoon show from the early 1980s until 2009, which led to his being one of the best-known and most popular voices in the county, described by the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; as &quot;a household name.&quot; Waller also hosted a Saturday morning country music programme, &quot;Rodeo Norfolk&quot;, which he continued to present following his departure from the weekday show, until ill health forced him to step down. Waller&#x27;s funeral in July 2010 was held at Norwich Cathedral and was attended by over 1,500 mourners.

From the early days of Radio Norfolk until 2007, Waller was the station&#x27;s commentator for Norwich City matches, known as &quot;the voice of Carrow Road&quot;. The station devotes extensive coverage to Norwich City, the county&#x27;s only professional football team, providing live coverage of all league and cup matches, as well as a post-match phone-in show &quot;Canary Call&quot; and fanzine show &quot;The Scrimmage&quot;, both of which are regarded as amongst the station&#x27;s most popular programmes. In 2011, when BBC economy measures raised the idea that local radio football commentaries could be cut back, the possibility was criticised by the local press in Norfolk, praising the station for the passion of its commentaries.

&quot;The Norfolk Airline&quot;, presented by David Clayton and Neil Walker, was the station&#x27;s first mid-morning programme, launched in 1983. In April 1986, the programme won the Sony Radio Academy Award for Best Magazine Programme, ahead of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;A Small Country Living&quot; and Capital Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Way It Is&quot;. The programme also made the news itself, when James Prior announced his resignation as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland live during a show.

The station won its second Radio Academy Award 28 years later in 2014, for Local Radio Journalist of the Year. The success of &quot;Airline&quot; eventually led to Clayton and Walker departing to make programmes for national radio on Radio 4.

From 1995 until his death in 2006, presenter and journalist John Mills presented &quot;Midday With Mills&quot;, a consumer affairs programme. The show gained a strong reputation for solving listeners&#x27; consumer problems, and in 2000 was given the British Insurance Brokers&#x27; Association Media Award for its work in this area.

From 1984 until 2009, &quot;BBC Look East&quot; presenter Stewart White was the presenter of the station&#x27;s Saturday breakfast show. White was the first presenter to go on-air after the station moved studios from Norfolk Tower to The Forum in the summer of 2003.

===Managing editors===
BBC Radio Norfolk has had five managing editors. The founding editor was Mike Chaney, appointed at the beginning of 1980 to oversee the setting-up of the radio station. Chaney had previously been working on the &quot;Today programme&quot; at BBC Radio 4, but lost his role there during a behind-the-scenes shake-up. In recompense for this, Chaney was promised the editorship of a BBC local radio station, and was given the job at Norfolk. Before working on &quot;Today&quot;, he had been the founding editor of BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Newsbeat&quot; programme in 1973, and prior to this had worked as a journalist for &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper.

Chaney was succeeded in 1982 by Keith Salmon, who had been working at BBC Radio Oxford. He had first joined the BBC in 1961, and had also worked at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, the BBC&#x27;s famous electronic music and sound effects department in London. At Oxford, Salmon had been a presenter and the programme organiser. He remained managing editor of BBC Radio Norfolk for thirteen years, until his retirement in 1995.

Tim Bishop had a background in local newspapers in Norfolk, having worked on the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; and been the news editor for the &quot;Norwich Evening News&quot;, before joining the BBC in 1994. Immediately prior to becoming the managing editor of BBC Radio Norfolk, Bishop had been the Education Correspondent for &quot;Look East&quot;. He subsequently returned to the television side of BBC East&#x27;s operations, and then became the Head of Regional and Local Programmes for the area in 2002. David Clayton became BBC Radio Norfolk&#x27;s managing editor in 1998, having been a broadcaster at the station since the early 1980s and the Assistant Editor under Salmon and then Bishop since 1991. During Clayton&#x27;s period in charge of the station, it gained its highest ever listening figures.

Clayton was replaced in March 2016 by Peter Cook, who combines his role as managing editor for both BBC Radio Norfolk and BBC Radio Suffolk.

==Impact==
===Audience===
BBC Radio Norfolk has frequently claimed some of the highest audience figures of any of the BBC&#x27;s local radio stations in England. Figures from the radio audience measuring body RAJAR have regularly shown that over 200,000 people in Norfolk listen to some part of the station&#x27;s output in any given week. When criticising proposed BBC local radio cutbacks in December 2011, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon claimed in a letter to Lord Patten, the Chairman of the BBC Trust, that only Radio 2 claimed a bigger audience in Norfolk than BBC Radio Norfolk.

===Awards and accolades===
BBC Radio Norfolk has twice won categories at the main industry awards, the Radio Academy Awards (formerly the Sony Awards). The &quot;Best Magazine Programme&quot; category was won by &quot;The Norfolk Airline&quot; in 1986, and in 2014, the station won its second Gold Award at the event, when the news team collectively won the &quot;Local Radio Journalist of the Year&quot; category. In 2010, wildlife expert Chris Skinner was runner-up in the Best Specialist Contributor category for his broadcasts as part of Matthew Gudgin&#x27;s programme. In 2004, &quot;Today in Norfolk&quot; was nominated in the Best Breakfast Show category, while in 2006, BBC Radio Norfolk as a whole was a nominee for the Station of the Year Award.

BBC Radio Norfolk has also won success at the Frank Gillard Awards, the BBC&#x27;s own internal awards for its local radio stations. In 2010, the station&#x27;s Sophie Price won the Original Journalism category for a documentary she had made about teenage pregnancy in Norfolk. In 2002, the station was the runner-up in the Best Radio Feature category for &quot;Liberators&quot;, and in 2006, took another silver, when David Clayton&#x27;s &quot;Norfolk Years&quot; programme was the runner-up in the Best Interactive Programme category.

Local and regional awards have included a win in the Best Radio Programme category at the 2009 Creative East Awards for the show &quot;Treasure Quest&quot;. At the 2006 EDF Energy East of England Media Awards, the station&#x27;s Paul Moseley won the Radio Journalist of the Year award. He repeated this feat in 2007, becoming the first two-time winner of the award. In 2009, Nikki Fox won the title, and at the 2010 ceremony, Nicky Price was joint-winner of the Sports Journalist of the Year category, while the Nick Conrad show took the Radio News / Current Affairs Programme of the Year title.

At the Parliamentary Jazz Awards in 2011, presenter Paul Barnes won the Broadcaster of the Year category for his show &quot;The Late Paul Barnes&quot;, broadcast from BBC Radio Norfolk, but shared across the BBC East region.

===Criticism===
Keith Skipper, a former presenter on the station until he left in 1995, has criticised Radio Norfolk for a lack of local focus to some of its programming. In an article published in the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; in February 2012, Norwich City Independent Supporters Club chairman Robin Sainty described the station&#x27;s post-match phone-in programme &quot;Canary Call&quot; as &quot;audio surrealism&quot;, criticising the quality of callers phoning in with their views.

==District offices==
===Great Yarmouth===

In the early 1980s, BBC Radio Norfolk had a small office for the district reporter based in Great Yarmouth, situated in the premises of the Port and Haven Commissioners on the town&#x27;s South Quay. A more substantial Great Yarmouth presence opened in the summer of 1984. This was a district office and studio at Whitefriars Court on Stonecutters Way in the town. The studio there was used for live inserts into programmes from Norwich, interviews with guests from the Great Yarmouth area, and the preparation of pre-recorded items by the Great Yarmouth district reporter. The studio was also occasionally used for full live programmes. At one point, the Great Yarmouth office had a staff of three; a receptionist, a producer and a reporter. Latterly, it was a one-person operation staffed only by the district reporter. After 33 years of operation, the office and studio at Stonecutters Way was closed in April 2017.

===King&#x27;s Lynn===
The station&#x27;s initial office in King&#x27;s Lynn was located in a portable building situated behind the town hall. This was later replaced by a more substantial studio in the town&#x27;s Tuesday Market Place. The King&#x27;s Lynn district office and studio later moved to the North Lynn Business Village. Some programmes would be broadcast from the King&#x27;s Lynn studio once a week.

==Technical==

The 95.1 FM signal covers east and South Norfolk, 104.4 FM covers West Norfolk, while 95.6 FM (which came on-air on 12 September 2005) serves North Norfolk.

Since 31 March 2003, DAB signals originate from the NOW Digital Norfolk multiplex, originally broadcast on block 11B before moving to 10B on 10 September 2015. DAB coverage in West Norfolk is incomplete but was expanded on 29 February 2024 when the station launched in DAB+ on the King&#x27;s Lynn small-scale DAB multiplex.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 711 in the BBC East and BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire regions and streams online via BBC Sounds.

In January 2020, the BBC announced that Radio Norfolk&#x27;s medium wave (AM) service from Postwick on 855 kHz covering the eastern part of the county, would close later in the year. The transmitter was switched off, after a period of service just short of 40 years, on the morning of 9 April 2020.

<text>BBC Radio Suffolk is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Suffolk.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on St Matthews Street in Ipswich.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 97,000 listeners and a 6.7% share as of December 2023.

==Overview==
BBC Radio Suffolk began broadcasting on 12 April 1990. In 2004, it won was named Station of the Year in the Sony Radio Academy Awards.

Significant cuts to BBC Local Radio introduced by Tim Davie during his tenure as Director General of the BBC reduced the content produced in Suffolk to less than a quarter of the station&#x27;s output in late Summer 2023. 

==Technical==
BBC Radio Suffolk broadcasts to north-east Suffolk on 95.5 FM from the Oulton transmitter, East Suffolk on 95.9 FM from the Aldeburgh transmitter, Ipswich and south-east Suffolk on 103.9 FM from the Manningtree transmitter and West Suffolk on 104.6 FM from the Great Barton transmitter.

DAB transmissions from the Suffolk MUX began on 7 October 2017, on digital frequency 10C from Mendlesham (Central Suffolk and Ipswich), Puttock&#x27;s Hill (Bury St Edmunds), Warren Heath (Ipswich), Felixstowe (Town and Dock area). Due to the low number of masts currently in use, there is a lack of coverage along the Suffolk coast north of Felixstowe to Lowestoft. Sudbury, Newmarket, Haverhill, Lowestoft, Southwold, Beccles and Bungay also have very poor or no DAB coverage of the Suffolk MUX. BBC Radio Suffolk was the penultimate BBC Local Radio station to launch on DAB.

The station was added to Freeview channel 720 in the East of England on 6 June 2016, broadcasting from the Sudbury and Tacolneston transmitters and their dependent relays. The station is also available to stream via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==
Local programming is now only produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Ipswich studios from 6 am to 2pm on Mondays to Fridays - reduced to eight hours per weekday, with no local coverage at all at weekends. There are two exceptions to this: two one-hour sports shows on Mondays and Fridays at 6pm and live football commentary during Ipswich Town men&#x27;s matches. 

This &quot;cull&quot; in service followed the BBC Local Radio cuts introduced by Tim Davie at the end of Summer 2023. All other content for the station is produced in Cambridge, London and the Midlands, with &quot;split links&quot; and pre-recorded news/travel bulletins giving the listener the impression that the station still produces content from Suffolk outside the 6am to 2pm weekday slots. Before the cuts, there was live coverage of Ipswich Town women&#x27;s matches for significant games. It is unclear whether this will continue at present.

Radio Suffolk is licensed to broadcast commentary on all of Ipswich Town&#x27;s league and cup games on FM and DAB, but not on Freeview or via BBC Sounds.

<text>BBC Essex is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Essex.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on New London Road in Chelmsford.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 138,000 listeners and a 6.0% share as of December 2023.

==History==
BBC Essex launched on 5 November 1986. It broke from the naming convention of &quot;BBC &quot;Radio&quot; (county name)&quot; so as to avoid confusion with Essex Radio (later Essex FM, now Heart Essex). There was also a pirate station called Radio Essex in the 1960s, and currently, there is an independent commercial station called Radio Essex.

BBC Essex set out to be different from existing BBC local stations, which were often perceived as rather &quot;stuffy&quot; and &quot;worthy&quot;. It launched with a more upbeat sound, an almost &quot;tabloid&quot; news style and younger presenters than most stations; the BBC Essex symbol also did not feature the traditional BBC logo. However, in more recent years, the style has been toned down and the format is now more in line with the rest of the BBC local radio network.

The station has also employed a number of high-profile presenters including Alex Lester, James Whale, Jonathan Overend (BBC Radio 5 Live), Tim &#x27;Timbo&#x27; Lloyd (twice winner of Best Local DJ at the Sony Radio Awards), Mark Pougatch (ITV Sport), Dermot O&#x27;Leary (National radio &amp; TV presenter) and music promoter Eric &#x27;Monster&#x27; Hall.

A revised programme schedule at the station was launched in September 2015 following the appointment of Louise Birt as Managing Editor in April 2015, following the departure of predecessor Gerald Main, who held the role from 2007 until February 2015.

==Technical==
The strongest signal is 103.5 FM, which comes from the Great Braxted transmitter between Witham and Tiptree. It also transmits the Essex DAB mux. The 95.3 FM signal from South Benfleet is heard in most of the southern Thames Estuary.

There are no longer any AM transmitters broadcasting BBC Essex, the last two being closed in May 2021. The 500 ft Manningtree tower, which formerly transmitted BBC Essex on 729 kHz, also has Essex DAB.

The Bakers Wood (Chelmsford) transmitter, which formerly transmitted BBC Essex on 765 kHz, is another of the DAB transmitters. Local DAB signals, since 20 May 2002, are the Essex 12D multiplex, which has further transmitters at Maitland House (Southend-on-Sea town centre), Colchester, Sudbury (in Suffolk), and Rye Hill (south of Harlow - on a water tower). BBC Essex also used to transmit on 1530 kHz from Rayleigh (Southend) until it ceased broadcasting in January 2018 as a cost saving measure.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 716 across the BBC East, BBC London and BBC South East regions and streams online via BBC Sounds.

==Pirate BBC Essex==
From 10 to 17 April 2004, BBC Essex marked the fortieth anniversary of offshore radio in Britain by launching their own ship-based radio station, Pirate BBC Essex. Broadcasting from an old light vessel, the station transmitted sixties music and memories twenty-four hours a day all week. This was followed in August 2007 by another broadcast marking the anniversary of the closing of the pirate stations by the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act 1967.

Over the Easter Weekend in April 2009, the popular &quot;Pirate Radio Essex&quot; programme was resurrected by popular demand from listeners, occurring five days after the release of the comedy movie &quot;The Boat that Rocked&quot;. This was broadcast on the AM frequencies, as well as on the Internet, which resulted in many calls from as far away as New Zealand. Presenters included Johnnie Walker, Tony Blackburn, Dave Cash and Keith Skues as well as three of the station&#x27;s presenters: Steve Scruton; Ian Wyatt &amp; Ray Clark.

BBC Essex presenter Ray Clark authored a book called &#x27;Radio Caroline: The True Story of The Boat That Rocked&#x27; which was published in early 2014. Clark retired from BBC Essex on 20 June 2014 after leaving his award-winning breakfast show in February that year. Clark returned to BBC Essex in September 2015 to present a new, regular, Saturday morning show.

Pirate BBC Essex took to the airwaves for one final time on 13 and 14 August 2017.
Starting at 10 pm on 13 August 2017 Keith Skues presented his regular, 3-hour regional Sunday night show from the LV18 studio, and on 14 August 2017 programmes were broadcast commencing at 9 am, with the eventual closure at 3 pm, marking the 50th anniversary of the Marine Offences Act which closed most pirate radio stations.
Guest presenters included Johnnie Walker, Roger &#x27;Twiggy&#x27; Day, Tom Edwards and Norman St John.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Chelmsford studios from 6 am to 6 pm on Mondays to Fridays, 10am to 2pm at weekends and for sports coverage.

Off-peak programming, including the late show from 10 pm to 1 am, originates from London or Manchester.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Essex simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

<text>BBC Three Counties Radio is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the counties of Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at Grove Park in Dunstable.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 125,000 listeners and a 5.8% share as of December 2023.

==History==
===BBC Radio Bedfordshire (1985–1993)===
The station launched as &quot;Radio Bedfordshire&quot; on 24 June 1985, serving the whole of Bedfordshire plus (despite the name) North Buckinghamshire and the northern parts of Hertfordshire. Therefore Bedford, Luton, Dunstable, Milton Keynes, Knebworth, Berkhamsted, Tring, Harpenden, Leighton Buzzard, Aylesbury, Hemel Hempstead, St Albans, Hatfield, Welwyn Garden City, Letchworth Garden City, Stevenage and Hitchin were served by the new station. In 1992, the station became known as &quot;BBC Radio Bedfordshire with Herts and Bucks&quot;.

===BBC Three Counties Radio (1993–present)===
The station changed to its present name on 5 April 1993. The new name was intended to reflect the wider reach across the three counties and to give equal service to all. The editorial area was not, at that point, expanded but enhanced studio facilities and staff were devoted to Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire.

New transmitters at Epping Green and Bedmond extended the coverage area to Welwyn Garden City, Hatfield and west Hertfordshire in late 2005.

BBC Three Counties Radio became available on DAB radio on 14 February 2013. In June 2015, the station moved from its Luton base to new studios in Dunstable.

==Technical==
BBC Three Counties Radio broadcasts on FM on these frequencies (transmitter location in brackets):
* 90.4 FM (Epping Green, near Hertford)

* 94.7 FM (Quainton Hill, near Aylesbury)
* 95.5 FM (Sandy Heath)
* 98.0 FM (High Wycombe)
* 103.8 FM (Zouches Farm, near Luton)
* 104.5 FM (Bow Brickhill, near Milton Keynes)

The station broadcasts on DAB digital radio on the Herts, Beds and Bucks digital radio multiplex, transmitted from Sandy Heath, Aylesbury, Epping Green, Hemel Hempstead, Chepping Wycombe, Letchworth, Zouches Farm and Bow Brickhill.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 712 in the BBC East, BBC London and BBC South regions and streams online via BBC Sounds.

Marlow is officially covered by BBC Radio Berkshire on 94.6 FM, Royston is covered by BBC Radio Cambridgeshire on 96.0 FM and Princes Risborough is served by BBC Radio Oxford on 95.2 FM. Those towns can still receive BBC Three Counties Radio through DAB and Freeview TV.

<doc id="569394" wikidata="Q2876753" url="?curid=569394" title="BBC Radio Northampton">
<text>BBC Radio Northampton is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Northamptonshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on Abington Street in Northampton.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 70,000 listeners and a 4.0% share as of December 2023.

==History==
The station was launched at 6:45am on 16 June 1982 on 1107 AM and 96.6 FM, with Jon Beynon&#x27;s programme &quot;Start the Day&quot;, the first piece of music being John Williams&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; theme, followed by &quot;Work That Body&quot; by Diana Ross.

The first outside broadcast followed on 17 June 1982, and the official opening was performed by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.

The station was renamed &quot;BBC Northampton&quot; in 1990, but then reverted to BBC Radio Northampton on 3 April 2000.

==Technical==
The station has two FM transmitters. The 104.2 FM frequency broadcasts from the Boughton Green Road area of Northampton and covers the south and west of the county (including Northampton and surrounding area).

The 103.6 FM frequency broadcasts from a mast near the village of Geddington and covers the north and east of the county (including Kettering and Corby).

The station began DAB broadcasts on 28 March 2013 from the NOW Northampton Digital multiplex. The DAB transmitters are located at Northampton, Geddington, Towcester Potcote Farm, and Daventry. The transmitter at Daventry on Borough Hill was the BBC&#x27;s first long wave transmitter, which began broadcasting on 27 July 1925. It had not been previously used by the BBC since 1978.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 716 in the BBC East, BBC East Midlands and BBC South regions. It also streams online via BBC Sounds.

The station was originally available on 1107 kHz medium wave across the county from a transmitter at Kings Heath; this was reallocated to Virgin Radio using 1233 kHz.

Listeners in some southwestern parts of Northamptonshire, including Brackley, cannot receive FM signals that broadcast BBC Radio Northampton. However, those areas receive better FM signals from the Oxford transmitter which broadcasts BBC Radio Oxford on 95.2 FM.

==DAB licence==
On 11 October 2007, the DAB licence was awarded to NOW Digital. MuxCo had also bid for the licence.

NOW Digital expected to start broadcasting from the three transmitters at Northampton, Geddington and Daventry in September 2008, however transmissions eventually began on 28 March 2013 on DAB channel 10C.

From February 2015, Ofcom approved the separation of the Northamptonshire multiplex from the Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire multiplex, resulting in the removal of BBC Radio Northampton from the Herts, Beds and Bucks multiplex.

==Sports coverage==
BBC Radio Northampton airs extensive sports coverage, led by Sports Editor Graham McKechnie. Football commentators include Tim Oglethorpe, Martin Smith and Terry Angus for Northampton Town, Peter Short for Kettering Town, Chris Barrett at Brackley / Rushden and Chuck Middleton at Corby. McKechnie commentates on Northampton Saints rugby with Lennie Newman and Ian Hunter. Northants Steelbacks cricket commentators include McKechnie, Andrew Radd, Mal Loye and Phil Rowe.

Matches are covered on FM, DAB or both, with additional coverage on-line. 

The station broadcasts four weekly sports shows from 6 pm to 7 pm, these include &#x27;The Saints Show&#x27; on Wednesday presented by McKechnie and Newman, focusing on a guest from Northampton Saints and &#x27;The Cobblers Show&#x27; presented by Jake Sharpe on Thursday.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Northampton studios from 6 am to 2 pm on Mondays to Fridays.

All other programming became regional or national in 2023; much of this is broadcast from the studios of BBC Three Counties Radio.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Northampton simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

* Martin Stanford – one of the station&#x27;s original producer/presenters, Martin went on to spend over 25 years with Sky News. He is now a presenter at LBC News.

==ViLoR==
ViLoR (Virtual Local Radio) is the name of a BBC project that uses computer virtualisation and audio-over-IP to reduce the amount of equipment at a radio station. In 2014, BBC Radio Northampton became the first station to operate in this way. ViLoR has been implemented at all BBC Local Radio stations (except BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio London.)

<text>BBC Radio Cambridgeshire is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Cambridgeshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at the Cambridge Business Park on Cowley Road in Cambridge. The station also aired on MW, but stopped broadcasting on medium wave on 10 May 2021.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 67,000 listeners and a 3.4% share as of December 2023.

==Early history==

Radio Cambridgeshire began broadcasting on 1 May 1982 and was originally known as Radio Cambridge and Radio Peterborough. It was originally based at studios on Hills Road, close to Cambridge railway station.

The opening day was broadcast from Cambridge and all the district offices at Peterborough, Wisbech, March, Huntingdon and Ely. 

The original weekday presenters were:
* Julian Dunne (&quot;New Day&quot;, an all-speech news service that ran at the same hours as &quot;Today&quot; on BBC Radio 4, on which it was based)
* Anne Bristow and Jane Solomons, alternating (&quot;The Light Programme&quot;, a mixture of music and light interviews)
* Gina Madgett (&quot;The Home Service&quot;, a largely speech programme with interviews intended to interest listeners at home)

Under the first manager, Hal Bethell, Radio Cambridgeshire&#x27;s early broadcasts were restricted to a few hours at breakfast and two hours in the afternoon. but Hal Bethell left the station for health reasons, he was replaced by the deputy manager of Radio Lincolnshire, Dave Wilkinson. He extended broadcasting into the afternoon by hiring Radio Lincolnshire presenter, John Richards. Wilkinson returned to Radio Lincolnshire as manager and was replaced by Ian Masters, ex-presenter of BBC East&#x27;s regional TV news programme, &quot;Look East&quot;.

==Peterborough studios==

The former Peterborough studio opened in a single office in Broadway Court, rented from Peterborough Development Corporation, the body responsible for the city&#x27;s expansion as a new town. The broadcasting equipment was two Studer tape recorders, a four-channel mixer and two microphones, which were placed on a table surrounded by mobile sound baffles. Ian Cameron, the first Peterborough-based presenter, realised at the last moment that the wall behind the temporary studio abutted the office block&#x27;s lavatories and asked the staff in Cambridge to listen while he flushed the cistern. Nothing could be heard and the broadcast went ahead without fear of others in the office block inadvertently disturbing it.

In 1983, Peterborough was equipped with its own studio, using a 12-channel Audix mixing desk made in the county and two Studer B67 tape machines, with a third machine for editing in a neighbouring office. That office later become a studio as well, although it could go on the air only from the main studio alongside. The first complete programme from Peterborough was presented by Julia Booth (formerly of &quot;BBC Radio London&quot;) while the studio&#x27;s opening party was going on on the floor below.

In 1987, the studio gained the ability to broadcast localised opt-outs. At first, the opt-out was used only for traffic information in the morning news programme and, later in the day, for five-minute spots of purely local information. The first full opt-out programme from Peterborough was presented by Les Woodland in the afternoon while John Richards broadcast from Cambridge. Steve Somers presented the BBC Radio Peterborough daily Breakfast show. Production assistant for the opt-in station was Darren Deans. The next programme to opt out was &quot;Sounds Eastern&quot;, two hours of music and commentary aimed at Peterborough&#x27;s Indian, Pakistani, Sikh and Bengali population and presented by Ansar Ali. The Peterborough Breakfast show opt out was abandoned in 2012 due to BBC cutbacks, and presenter Paul Stainton took over presenting duties of the countywide breakfast show, then the mid-morning show following Andy Harper&#x27;s retirement in 2014, before leaving the station in September 2017.

==Outside broadcasts==
The station&#x27;s first outside broadcasts were of results from local elections held soon after the station went on the air. The station&#x27;s radio car was used from the back doors of the town hall in Peterborough. The reporter was Ian Cameron. The first complete programme broadcast away from the studio was the same year, from the East of England Show in Peterborough, presented by Anne Bristow.

==Symbol==
The first station badge or symbol was a design suggesting Cambridgeshire&#x27;s three main rivers, the Nene, the Ouse and the Cam. Before the station came on the air, the manager, Hal Bethell, arranged with the Pye radio company, which had long been associated with Cambridge, to use a design based on the sun-through-clouds design which Pye previously cut into the loudspeaker screens of its original radios.

The sun-and-clouds symbol remained until a BBC ruling that all its stations should have a joint logo to underline the national nature of the local service.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Cambridge studios from 6 am to 2 pm on weekdays with all other programming since 2023, apart from sports coverage, being regional or national.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Cambridgeshire simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

<doc id="569398" wikidata="Q638569" url="?curid=569398" title="Fanfare">
<text>A fanfare (or fanfarade or flourish) is a short musical flourish which is typically played by trumpets (including fanfare trumpets), French horns or other brass instruments, often accompanied by percussion. It is a &quot;brief improvisedintroduction to an instrumental performance&quot;. A fanfare has also been defined in &quot;The Golden Encyclopedia of Music&quot; as &quot;a musical announcement played on brass instruments before the arrival of an important person&quot;, such as heralding the entrance of a monarch (the term honors music for such announcements does not have the specific connotations of instrument or style that &quot;fanfare&quot; does). Historically, fanfares were usually played by trumpet players, as the trumpet was associated with royalty. Bugles are also mentioned. The melody notes of fanfare are often based around the major triad, often using &quot;heroic dotted rhythms&quot;.

By extension, the term may also designate a short, prominent passage for brass instruments in an orchestral composition. Fanfares are widely used in opera orchestral parts, notably in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;. In &quot;Fidelio&quot;, the dramatic use of the fanfare is heightened by having the trumpet player perform offstage, which creates a muted effect.

==Etymology==
The word has been traced to a 15th-century Spanish root, &#x27; (&quot;vaunting&quot;). Though the word may be onomatopoeic, it is also possible that it is derived from the Arabic word &#x27; (&quot;trumpets&quot;). The word is first found in 1546 in French, and in English in 1605, but it was not until the 19th century that it acquired its present meaning of a brief ceremonial flourish for brass. Indeed, an alternative term for the fanfare is &quot;flourish&quot;, as in the ruffles and flourishes played by military bands in the US to announce the arrival of the president, a general, or other high-ranking dignitary. &quot;In the England of Shakespeare&#x27;s time&quot;, fanfares &quot;were often known as flourishes and sometimes as &#x27;tuckets&#x27; &quot; (a word related to toccata).

==History==
In French usage, &quot;&quot; also may refer to a hunting signal (given either on &quot;starting&quot; a stag, or after the kill when the hounds are given their share of the animal). In both France and Italy, &quot;fanfare&quot; was the name given in the 19th century to a military or civilian brass band. In French, this usage continues to the present, and distinguishes the all-brass band from bands of mixed brass and woodwind, which is called &quot;Harmonie&quot;. The same applies in Belgium and the Netherlands, where competitions for fanfares are held to this day, well separate from other wind ensembles such as brass bands and &quot;harmonies&quot;. Fanfares have been imitated in art music as early as the 14th century. Examples in opera include a fanfare for the governor&#x27;s arrival in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, act 2. In the 20th century, well-known composed fanfares include Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; (1942), for brass and percussion, and Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare for a New Theatre&quot; (1964), for two trumpets.

Copland&#x27;s Fanfare is one of a series of 18 commissioned by Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra conductor Eugene Goossens in 1942–43, each to open a concert. Each was to salute an aspect of the war effort; the U.S. had entered World War II the previous year. The only one of these fanfares to become well known is Copland&#x27;s; the others are rarely if ever performed or recorded. The set, with the date of the concert at which each was performed, is:

<text>In physiology, a stimulus is a change in a living thing&#x27;s internal or external environment. This change can be detected by an organism or organ using sensitivity, and leads to a physiological reaction. Sensory receptors can receive stimuli from outside the body, as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye, as well as from inside the body, as in chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors. When a stimulus is detected by a sensory receptor, it can elicit a reflex via stimulus transduction. An internal stimulus is often the first component of a homeostatic control system. External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body, as in the fight-or-flight response. In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability, its level of strength must exceed the absolute threshold; if a signal does reach threshold, the information is transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS), where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made. Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond, it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not.

==Types==

===Internal===

====Homeostatic imbalances====
Homeostatic outbalances are the main driving force for changes of the body. These stimuli are monitored closely by receptors and sensors in different parts of the body. These sensors are mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors and thermoreceptors that, respectively, respond to pressure or stretching, chemical changes, or temperature changes. Examples of mechanoreceptors include baroreceptors which detect changes in blood pressure, Merkel&#x27;s discs which can detect sustained touch and pressure, and hair cells which detect sound stimuli. Homeostatic imbalances that can serve as internal stimuli include nutrient and ion levels in the blood, oxygen levels, and water levels. Deviations from the homeostatic ideal may generate a homeostatic emotion, such as pain, thirst or fatigue, that motivates behavior that will restore the body to stasis (such as withdrawal, drinking or resting).
====Blood pressure====
Blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output are measured by stretch receptors found in the carotid arteries. Nerves embed themselves within these receptors and when they detect stretching, they are stimulated and fire action potentials to the central nervous system. These impulses inhibit the constriction of blood vessels and lower the heart rate. If these nerves do not detect stretching, the body determines perceives low blood pressure as a dangerous stimulus and signals are not sent, preventing the inhibition CNS action; blood vessels constrict and the heart rate increases, causing an increase in blood pressure in the body.

===External===

====Touch and pain====
Sensory feelings, especially pain, are stimuli that can elicit a large response and cause neurological changes in the body. Pain also causes a behavioral change in the body, which is proportional to the intensity of the pain. The feeling is recorded by sensory receptors on the skin and travels to the central nervous system, where it is integrated and a decision on how to respond is made; if it is decided that a response must be made, a signal is sent back down to a muscle, which behaves appropriately according to the stimulus. The postcentral gyrus is the location of the primary somatosensory area, the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch.

Pain receptors are known as nociceptors. Two main types of nociceptors exist, A-fiber nociceptors and C-fiber nociceptors. A-fiber receptors are myelinated and conduct currents rapidly. They are mainly used to conduct fast and sharp types of pain. Conversely, C-fiber receptors are unmyelinated and slowly transmit. These receptors conduct slow, burning, diffuse pain.

The absolute threshold for touch is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from touch receptors. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be the force exerted by dropping the wing of a bee onto a person&#x27;s cheek from a distance of one centimeter. This value will change based on the body part being touched.

====Vision====
Vision provides opportunity for the brain to perceive and respond to changes occurring around the body. Information, or stimuli, in the form of light enters the retina, where it excites a special type of neuron called a photoreceptor cell. A local graded potential begins in the photoreceptor, where it excites the cell enough for the impulse to be passed along through a track of neurons to the central nervous system. As the signal travels from photoreceptors to larger neurons, action potentials must be created for the signal to have enough strength to reach the CNS. If the stimulus does not warrant a strong enough response, it is said to not reach absolute threshold, and the body does not react. However, if the stimulus is strong enough to create an action potential in neurons away from the photoreceptor, the body will integrate the information and react appropriately. Visual information is processed in the occipital lobe of the CNS, specifically in the primary visual cortex.

The absolute threshold for vision is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from photoreceptors in the eye. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be the amount of light present from someone holding up a single candle 30 miles away, if one&#x27;s eyes were adjusted to the dark.

====Smell====
Smell allows the body to recognize chemical molecules in the air through inhalation. Olfactory organs located on either side of the nasal septum consist of olfactory epithelium and lamina propria. The olfactory epithelium, which contains olfactory receptor cells, covers the inferior surface of the cribiform plate, the superior portion of the perpendicular plate, the superior nasal concha. Only roughly two percent of airborne compounds inhaled are carried to olfactory organs as a small sample of the air being inhaled. Olfactory receptors extend past the epithelial surface providing a base for many cilia that lie in the surrounding mucus. Odorant-binding proteins interact with these cilia stimulating the receptors. Odorants are generally small organic molecules. Greater water and lipid solubility is related directly to stronger smelling odorants. Odorant binding to G protein coupled receptors activates adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP to camp. cAMP, in turn, promotes the opening of sodium channels resulting in a localized potential.

The absolute threshold for smell is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the nose. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a single drop of perfume in a six-room house. This value will change depending on what substance is being smelled.

====Taste====
Taste records flavoring of food and other materials that pass across the tongue and through the mouth. Gustatory cells are located on the surface of the tongue and adjacent portions of the pharynx and larynx. Gustatory cells form on taste buds, specialized epithelial cells, and are generally turned over every ten days. From each cell, protrudes microvilli, sometimes called taste hairs, through also the taste pore and into the oral cavity. Dissolved chemicals interact with these receptor cells; different tastes bind to specific receptors. Salt and sour receptors are chemically gated ion channels, which depolarize the cell. Sweet, bitter, and umami receptors are called gustducins, specialized G protein coupled receptors. Both divisions of receptor cells release neurotransmitters to afferent fibers causing action potential firing.

The absolute threshold for taste is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the mouth. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a single drop of quinine sulfate in 250 gallons of water.

====Sound====
Changes in pressure caused by sound reaching the external ear resonate in the tympanic membrane, which articulates with the auditory ossicles, or the bones of the middle ear. These tiny bones multiply these pressure fluctuations as they pass the disturbance into the cochlea, a spiral-shaped bony structure within the inner ear. Hair cells in the cochlear duct, specifically the organ of Corti, are deflected as waves of fluid and membrane motion travel through the chambers of the cochlea. Bipolar sensory neurons located in the center of the cochlea monitor the information from these receptor cells and pass it on to the brainstem via the cochlear branch of cranial nerve VIII. Sound information is processed in the temporal lobe of the CNS, specifically in the primary auditory cortex.

The absolute threshold for sound is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the ears. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a watch ticking in an otherwise soundless environment 20 feet away.

====Equilibrium====
Semi circular ducts, which are connected directly to the cochlea, can interpret and convey to the brain information about equilibrium by a similar method as the one used for hearing. Hair cells in these parts of the ear protrude kinocilia and stereocilia into a gelatinous material that lines the ducts of this canal. In parts of these semi circular canals, specifically the maculae, calcium carbonate crystals known as statoconia rest on the surface of this gelatinous material. When tilting the head or when the body undergoes linear acceleration, these crystals move disturbing the cilia of the hair cells and, consequently, affecting the release of neurotransmitter to be taken up by surrounding sensory nerves. In other areas of the semi circular canal, specifically the ampulla, a structure known as the cupula—analogous to the gelatinous material in the maculae—distorts hair cells in a similar fashion when the fluid medium that surrounds it causes the cupula itself to move. The ampulla communicates to the brain information about the head&#x27;s horizontal rotation. Neurons of the adjacent vestibular ganglia monitor the hair cells in these ducts. These sensory fibers form the vestibular branch of the cranial nerve VIII.

==Cellular response==

In general, cellular response to stimuli is defined as a change in state or activity of a cell in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, or gene expression. Receptors on cell surfaces are sensing components that monitor stimuli and respond to changes in the environment by relaying the signal to a control center for further processing and response. Stimuli are always converted into electrical signals via transduction. This electrical signal, or receptor potential, takes a specific pathway through the nervous system to initiate a systematic response. Each type of receptor is specialized to respond preferentially to only one kind of stimulus energy, called the adequate stimulus. Sensory receptors have a well-defined range of stimuli to which they respond, and each is tuned to the particular needs of the organism. Stimuli are relayed throughout the body by mechanotransduction or chemotransduction, depending on the nature of the stimulus.

===Mechanical===
In response to a mechanical stimulus, cellular sensors of force are proposed to be extracellular matrix molecules, cytoskeleton, transmembrane proteins, proteins at the membrane-phospholipid interface, elements of the nuclear matrix, chromatin, and the lipid bilayer. Response can be twofold: the extracellular matrix, for example, is a conductor of mechanical forces but its structure and composition is also influenced by the cellular responses to those same applied or endogenously generated forces. Mechanosensitive ion channels are found in many cell types and it has been shown that the permeability of these channels to cations is affected by stretch receptors and mechanical stimuli. This permeability of ion channels is the basis for the conversion of the mechanical stimulus into an electrical signal.

===Chemical===
Chemical stimuli, such as odorants, are received by cellular receptors that are often coupled to ion channels responsible for chemotransduction. Such is the case in olfactory cells. Depolarization in these cells result from opening of non-selective cation channels upon binding of the odorant to the specific receptor. G protein-coupled receptors in the plasma membrane of these cells can initiate second messenger pathways that cause cation channels to open.

In response to stimuli, the sensory receptor initiates sensory transduction by creating graded potentials or action potentials in the same cell or in an adjacent one. Sensitivity to stimuli is obtained by chemical amplification through second messenger pathways in which enzymatic cascades produce large numbers of intermediate products, increasing the effect of one receptor molecule.

==Systematic response==

===Nervous-system response===
Though receptors and stimuli are varied, most extrinsic stimuli first generate localized graded potentials in the neurons associated with the specific sensory organ or tissue. In the nervous system, internal and external stimuli can elicit two different categories of responses: an excitatory response, normally in the form of an action potential, and an inhibitory response. When a neuron is stimulated by an excitatory impulse, neuronal dendrites are bound by neurotransmitters which cause the cell to become permeable to a specific type of ion; the type of neurotransmitter determines to which ion the neurotransmitter will become permeable. In excitatory postsynaptic potentials, an excitatory response is generated. This is caused by an excitatory neurotransmitter, normally glutamate binding to a neuron&#x27;s dendrites, causing an influx of sodium ions through channels located near the binding site.

This change in membrane permeability in the dendrites is known as a local graded potential and causes the membrane voltage to change from a negative resting potential to a more positive voltage, a process known as depolarization. The opening of sodium channels allows nearby sodium channels to open, allowing the change in permeability to spread from the dendrites to the cell body. If a graded potential is strong enough, or if several graded potentials occur in a fast enough frequency, the depolarization is able to spread across the cell body to the axon hillock. From the axon hillock, an action potential can be generated and propagated down the neuron&#x27;s axon, causing sodium ion channels in the axon to open as the impulse travels. Once the signal begins to travel down the axon, the membrane potential has already passed threshold, which means that it cannot be stopped. This phenomenon is known as an all-or-nothing response. Groups of sodium channels opened by the change in membrane potential strengthen the signal as it travels away from the axon hillock, allowing it to move the length of the axon. As the depolarization reaches the end of the axon, or the axon terminal, the end of the neuron becomes permeable to calcium ions, which enters the cell via calcium ion channels. Calcium causes the release of neurotransmitters stored in synaptic vesicles, which enter the synapse between two neurons known as the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons; if the signal from the presynaptic neuron is excitatory, it will cause the release of an excitatory neurotransmitter, causing a similar response in the postsynaptic neuron. These neurons may communicate with thousands of other receptors and target cells through extensive, complex dendritic networks. Communication between receptors in this fashion enables discrimination and the more explicit interpretation of external stimuli. Effectively, these localized graded potentials trigger action potentials that communicate, in their frequency, along nerve axons eventually arriving in specific cortexes of the brain. In these also highly specialized parts of the brain, these signals are coordinated with others to possibly trigger a new response.

If a signal from the presynaptic neuron is inhibitory, inhibitory neurotransmitters, normally GABA will be released into the synapse. This neurotransmitter causes an inhibitory postsynaptic potential in the postsynaptic neuron. This response will cause the postsynaptic neuron to become permeable to chloride ions, making the membrane potential of the cell negative; a negative membrane potential makes it more difficult for the cell to fire an action potential and prevents any signal from being passed on through the neuron. Depending on the type of stimulus, a neuron can be either excitatory or inhibitory.

===Muscular-system response===
Nerves in the peripheral nervous system spread out to various parts of the body, including muscle fibers. A muscle fiber and the motor neuron to which it is connected. The spot at which the motor neuron attaches to the muscle fiber is known as the neuromuscular junction. When muscles receive information from internal or external stimuli, muscle fibers are stimulated by their respective motor neuron. Impulses are passed from the central nervous system down neurons until they reach the motor neuron, which releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the neuromuscular junction. ACh binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the surface of the muscle cell and opens ion channels, allowing sodium ions to flow into the cell and potassium ions to flow out; this ion movement causes a depolarization, which allows for the release of calcium ions within the cell. Calcium ions bind to proteins within the muscle cell to allow for muscle contraction; the ultimate consequence of a stimulus.

===Endocrine-system response===

====Vasopressin====
The endocrine system is affected largely by many internal and external stimuli. One internal stimulus that causes hormone release is blood pressure. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is a large driving force for the release of vasopressin, a hormone which causes the retention of water in the kidneys. This process also increases an individual&#x27;s thirst. By fluid retention or by consuming fluids, if an individual&#x27;s blood pressure returns to normal, vasopressin release slows and less fluid is retained by the kidneys. Hypovolemia, or low fluid levels in the body, can also act as a stimulus to cause this response.

====Epinephrine====
Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is also used commonly to respond to both internal and external changes. One common cause of the release of this hormone is the Fight-or-flight response. When the body encounters an external stimulus that is potentially dangerous, epinephrine is released from the adrenal glands. Epinephrine causes physiological changes in the body, such as constriction of blood vessels, dilation of pupils, increased heart and respiratory rate, and the metabolism of glucose. All of these responses to a single stimuli aid in protecting the individual, whether the decision is made to stay and fight, or run away and avoid danger.

===Digestive-system response===

====Cephalic phase====
The digestive system can respond to external stimuli, such as the sight or smell of food, and cause physiological changes before the food ever enters the body. This reflex is known as the cephalic phase of digestion. The sight and smell of food are strong enough stimuli to cause salivation, gastric and pancreatic enzyme secretion, and endocrine secretion in preparation for the incoming nutrients; by starting the digestive process before food reaches the stomach, the body is able to more effectively and efficiently metabolize food into necessary nutrients. Once food hits the mouth, taste and information from receptors in the mouth add to the digestive response. Chemoreceptors and mechanorceptors, activated by chewing and swallowing, further increase the enzyme release in the stomach and intestine.

====Enteric nervous system====
The digestive system is also able to respond to internal stimuli. The digestive tract, or enteric nervous system alone contains millions of neurons. These neurons act as sensory receptors that can detect changes, such as food entering the small intestine, in the digestive tract. Depending on what these sensory receptors detect, certain enzymes and digestive juices from the pancreas and liver can be secreted to aid in metabolism and breakdown of food.

==Research methods and techniques==

===Clamping techniques===

Intracellular measurements of electrical potential across the membrane can be obtained by microelectrode recording. Patch clamp techniques allow for the manipulation of the intracellular or extracellular ionic or lipid concentration while still recording potential. In this way, the effect of various conditions on threshold and propagation can be assessed.

===Noninvasive neuronal scanning===

Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) permit the noninvasive visualization of activated regions of the brain while the test subject is exposed to different stimuli. Activity is monitored in relation to blood flow to a particular region of the brain.

===Other methods===
Hindlimb withdrawal time is another method. Sorin Barac et al. in a recent paper published in the Journal of Reconstructive Microsurgery monitored the response of test rats to pain stimuli by inducing an acute, external heat stimulus and measuring hindlimb withdrawal times (HLWT).

<text>BBC Radio Kent is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Kent.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at The Great Hall in Royal Tunbridge Wells.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 142,000 listeners and a 1.7% share as of December 2023.

==History==
The radio station was launched in 1970 as BBC Radio Medway, originally only serving the Medway Towns. It broadcast from studios at 30 High Street in Rochester, a former newspaper office which was subsequently named Media House. The station became well known in the early 1980s for its early Friday evening soul music show presented by DJ Dave Brown, becoming one of the most listened to soul shows in the UK before DJ Robbie Vincent earned that achievement with the national broadcaster BBC Radio 1 in 1983.

The station gained its current name on 2 July 1983 when operations expanded to cover all of Kent as part of the BBC&#x27;s policy of operating countywide stations. Radio Medway was closed down by long serving staff member Rod Lucas, who was also the first voice to be heard on the new BBC Radio Kent.

In July 1986, the studios moved to the nearby Sun Pier, from where it broadcast in stereo for the first time.

On 18 March 1994, BBC Radio Kent stopped broadcasting on 1035 kHz MW due to the frequency being reallocated to a new London-wide commercial radio station and then in January 2018 774 and 1602 kHz stopped broadcasting due to cost savings.

In 2001, the station moved to The Great Hall in Royal Tunbridge Wells, to combine with new television studios for the BBC South East region covering Kent and Sussex. From here, BBC Radio Kent operates a total of five studios – two for programmes, one for news bulletins, one network contributions area, and a comprehensive live performance area. Since gaining the live performance area, live music has played an increasingly important part of the station&#x27;s output. The music studio is in use daily as part of the evening arts strand &quot;The Dominic King Show&quot;. 

In 2015, under the direction of a new Station Managing Editor, the station created a comprehensive Station Imaging Creative Department. Organised more along the lines of a commercial stations Creative Department, it is responsible for trails, idents and jingles. The three person department also undertook creative imaging for shared programmes originating from Tunbridge Wells, as well as providing trails for other stations in the South East cluster. Other Local BBC Radio usually has a single Station Sound producer, not a whole department. 

BBC Radio Kent also operated a studio and office in The Wendy House (a building close to the original Sun Pier site in Chatham), although this has since closed, and small contributions studios in Dover and Canterbury.

==Technical==
BBC Radio Kent broadcasts on 96.7 FM for North and West Kent from the Wrotham transmitting station on the North Downs, close to the village of Wrotham, 97.6 FM for Folkstone and surrounding areas from the Creteway Down transmitting station situated north east of the town and 104.2 FM from the Swingate transmitting station located at the village of Swingate, near Dover covering Canterbury, south and east Kent. It also broadcast on DAB.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 711 in the BBC South East region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==
Local programming airs from the BBC&#x27;s Tunbridge studios from 6 am to 2 pm on weekdays and for sports coverage.

Off-peak programming, including the weekday late show from 10 pm to 1 am, originates from BBC Radio Solent in Southampton, BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio London. 

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Kent simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

<text>The Pic du Midi de Bigorre or simply the Pic du Midi (elevation ) is a mountain in the French Pyrenees. It is the site of the Pic du Midi Observatory.

== Pic du Midi Observatory ==

The Pic du Midi Observatory () is an astronomical observatory located at 2,877 meters on top of the Pic du Midi de Bigorre in the French Pyrenees. It is part of the Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées (OMP) which has additional research stations in the southwestern French towns of Tarbes, Lannemezan, and Auch, as well as many partnerships in South America, Africa, and Asia, due to the guardianship it receives from the French Research Institute for Development (IRD).

Construction of the observatory began in 1878 under the auspices of the Société Ramond, but by 1882 the society decided that the spiralling costs were beyond its relatively modest means, and yielded the observatory to the French state, which took it into its possession by a law of 7 August 1882. The 8 metre dome was completed in 1908, under the ambitious direction of Benjamin Baillaud. It housed a powerful mechanical equatorial reflector which was used in 1909 to formally discredit the Martian canal theory. In 1946 Mr. Gentilli funded a dome and a 0.60-meter telescope, and in 1958, a spectrograph was installed.

A 1.06-meter (42-inch) telescope was installed in 1963, funded by NASA and was used to take detailed photographs of the surface of the Moon in preparation for the Apollo missions. In 1965 the astronomers and Janine Connes were able to formulate a detailed analysis of the composition of the atmospheres on Mars and Venus, based on the infrared spectra gathered from these planets. The results showed atmospheres in chemical equilibrium. This analysis led James Lovelock, a scientist working for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, to conclude that neither Mars nor Venus had life.

The 2-metre Bernard Lyot Telescope was placed at the observatory in 1980 on top of a 28-meter column built off to the side to avoid wind turbulence affecting the seeing of the other telescopes. It is the largest telescope in France. The observatory also has a coronagraph, which is used to study the solar corona. A 0.60-meter telescope (the Gentilly&#x27;s T60 telescope) is also located at the top of Pic du Midi. Since 1982 this T60 is dedicated to amateur astronomy and managed by a group of amateurs, called association T60.

The observatory consists of:
* The 0.55-meter telescope (Robley Dome);
* The 0.60-meter telescope (T60 Dome, welcoming amateur astronomers via the Association T60);
* The 1.06-meter telescope (Gentilli Dome) dedicated to observations of the solar system;
* The 2-meter telescope or Bernard Lyot Telescope (used with a new generation stellar spectropolarimeter);
* The coronagraph HACO-CLIMSO (studies of the solar corona);
* The bezel Jean Rösch (studies of the solar surface)
* The Charvin dome, which sheltered a photoelectric coronometer (which studied the Sun);
* The Baillaud dome, reassigned to the museum in 2000 and which houses a 1:1 scale model coronagraph.

The observatory is located very close to the Greenwich meridian.

Saturn&#x27;s moon Helene (Saturn XII or Dione B), was discovered by French astronomers Pierre Laques and Jean Lecacheux in 1980 from ground-based observations at Pic du Midi, and named Helene in 1988. It is also a trojan moon of Dione.

The main-belt asteroid 20488 Pic-du-Midi, discovered at Pises Observatory in 1999, was named for the observatory and the mountain it is located on.

=== List of discovered minor planets ===
The Minor Planet Center credits the discovery of the following minor planets directly to the observatory (as of 2017, no discoveries have been assigned to individual astronomers):


=== International Dark Sky Reserve ===

Officially initiated in 2009, during the international year of astronomy, the Pic du Midi International Dark Sky Reserve (IDSR) was labeled in 2013 by the International Dark-Sky Association. It&#x27;s the sixth in the world, the first in Europe and the only one still today in France.

The IDSR aims to limit the exponential propagation of light pollution, in order to preserve the quality of the night. Co-managed by the Syndicat mixte for the tourist promotion of the Pic du Midi, the Pyrénées National Park and the Departmental Energy Union 65, its priority actions are the public education on the impacts and consequences of these pollutions as well as the establishment of responsible lighting in the Haut-Pyrenean territory.

It covers 3,000 km2, or 65% of the Hautes-Pyrénées. The IDSR includes 251 communes spread around the Pic du Midi de Bigorre and is distinguished in two zones:

* A core zone, devoid of any permanent lighting and witnessing an exceptional night quality;
* A buffer zone, in which the territory actors recognize the importance of the nocturnal environment and undertake to protect it.

The IDSR initiated the program &quot;Ciel Etoilé&quot; (Starry sky), program of reconversion of the 40 000 luminous points of its territory, the program &quot;Gardiens des Etoiles&quot; (Guardians of the stars), program of metrological monitoring of the light pollution evolution, but also the program &quot;Adap&#x27;Ter&quot;, project that will identify &quot;trames sombres&quot; (Dark frame: nocturnal biodiversity deplacements).

==Climate==

Pic du Midi de Bigorre has a mediterranean alpine climate with a polar temperature regime due to its high elevation. Due to the Gulf Stream moderation of the surrounding lowlands, temperature swings are in general quite low. This results in temperatures rarely exceeding even during lowland heat waves, and also temperatures beneath being extremely rare. The UV index is higher than in the surrounding lowlands due to the elevation. Snow cover is permanent during winter months, but melts for a few months each year. Seasonal lag is extreme during winter and spring, with February being the clearly coldest month, and May having mean temperatures below freezing. Among lowland climates, the station closely resembles Nuuk in Greenland for the temperature regime.

<doc id="569405" wikidata="Q267733" url="?curid=569405" title="Thaïs">
<text>Thaïs (; ; ) was a Greek who accompanied Alexander the Great on his military campaigns. Likely from Athens, she is most famous for having instigated the burning of Persepolis, the capital city of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, after it was conquered by Alexander&#x27;s army in 330 BCE. At the time, Thaïs was the lover of Ptolemy I Soter, who was one of Alexander&#x27;s close companions and generals. It has been suggested that she may also have been Alexander&#x27;s lover on the basis of a statement by the Greek rhetorician Athenaeus, who writes that Alexander liked to &quot;keep Thaïs about him&quot; without directly classifying the nature of their relationship as intimate; this may simply have meant that he enjoyed her company, as she is said to have been very witty and entertaining. Athenaeus also states that after Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BCE, Thaïs married Ptolemy and bore three of his children.

==Role in Alexander&#x27;s conquest of Persia==

=== Burning of Persepolis ===
Thaïs supposedly came from Athens and accompanied Alexander throughout his campaigns in Asia. She came to the attention of history when, in 330 BC, Alexander burned down the palace of Persepolis, the principal residence of the defeated Achaemenid dynasty, after a drinking party. Thaïs was present at the party and gave a speech which convinced Alexander to burn the palace. Cleitarchus claims that the destruction was a whim; Plutarch and Diodorus assert that it was intended as retribution for Xerxes&#x27; burning of the old Temple of Athena on the Acropolis in Athens (the site of the extant Parthenon) in 480 BC during the second Persian invasion of Greece.


=== Relationship with Alexander ===
It has been argued that Thaïs was at this time Alexander&#x27;s lover. T. D. Ogden suggests that Ptolemy took her over at some later point, though other writers believe she was always Ptolemy&#x27;s companion.

==Later life and family==
Thaïs&#x27;s subsequent career is uncertain. According to Athenaeus (who lived more than five centuries later), she married her lover Ptolemy, who became king of Egypt, after Alexander&#x27;s death. Even if they were not actually married, their relationship seems to have acquired &quot;quasi-legal status&quot;. 

=== Children ===
She has three children with Ptolemy, two boys and a girl: 
* Lagus, who is known from a reference to his victory in a chariot race in the Lycaea, an Arcadian festival, in 308/307.
* Alexander Leontiscus, who appears to have been in Cyprus with his sister, as he recorded there as a prisoner taken by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 307 or 306 after his invasion of the island. He was later sent home to Ptolemy.
* Eirene, who was given in marriage to Eunostos, king of Soloi in Cyprus.

Whatever the legal status of their relationship, Thaïs’ role in Egypt is unclear. Ptolemy had other wives, first Eurydice of Egypt, and later Berenice I of Egypt, who became his principal consort and mother of his heir.

The date of Thaïs&#x27;s death is unknown.

==In literature==
Her larger-than-life persona has resulted in characters named Thaïs appearing in several literary works, the most famous of which are listed below. In the post-classical period she is commonly portrayed in literature and art as Alexander&#x27;s rather than Ptolemy&#x27;s lover.

===Classical===
In Terence&#x27;s play &quot;Eunuchus&quot;, there is a female protagonist who is a courtesan named Thaïs after the historical figure. Thaïs&#x27; words from the play are quoted in Cicero&#x27;s essay &quot;De Amicitia&quot;.

In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Remedia Amoris&quot; (383), Thaïs is contrasted with Andromache, the epitome of the loyal wife, while Thaïs is the epitome of sex. Thaïs, says Ovid, is the subject of his art.

Athenaeus&#x27;s book &quot;The Deipnosophists&quot; records a number of remarks attributed to Thaïs. She &quot;said once to a boastful lover of hers, who had borrowed some goblets from a great many people, and said that he meant to break them up, and make others of them, &#x27;You will destroy what belongs to each private person&#x27;.&quot; Another time, when asked who she was visiting she said &quot;To dwell with Aegeus, great Pandion&#x27;s son,&quot; - a witty way of describing an unknown patron as a smelly goat (Aegeus Sea, or Goat Sea, was named after Aegeus the smelly goat son born of Pandion from a bestial relationship).

===Post-Classical===

In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, a character called Thaïs is one of just a few women whom Dante Alighieri sees on his journey through Hell (Inferno, XVIII, 133–136). She is located in the circle of the flatterers, plunged in a trench of excrement, having been consigned there, we are told by Virgil, for having uttered to her lover that she was &quot;marvellously&quot; fond of him. Dante&#x27;s Thaïs may or may not be intended to represent the historical courtesan, but the words ascribed to her derive from Cicero&#x27;s quotations from Terence.

Thaïs is mentioned as one of the famous historical beauties in François Villon&#x27;s &quot;Ballade des dames du temps jadis&quot; (1461).

Thaïs and Alexander the Great are conjured by Faustus in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; for the amusement of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

Thaïs appears as Alexander&#x27;s mistress in John Dryden&#x27;s poem &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast, or the Power of Music&quot; (1697), which begins with a description of Alexander enthroned with &quot;the lovely Thaïs by his side&quot; who sat &quot;like a blooming eastern bride&quot;. The poem&#x27;s account of the feast ends by comparing Thaïs to Helen of Troy: &quot;Thaïs led the way/To light him to his prey/And like another Helen, fired another Troy.&quot; The poem was later set to music as an oratorio, also called &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot;, by George Frederick Handel. Robert Herrick (1591–1674) in &quot;What Kind of Mistress He Would Have&quot; concludes, &quot;Let her Lucrece all day be, Thaïs in the night to me, Be she such as neither will, Famish me, nor overfill.&quot;

Thaïs is a supporting character in two novels by Mary Renault about Alexander the Great: &quot;Fire from Heaven&quot; and &quot;The Persian Boy&quot;, as well as in Renault&#x27;s biography of Alexander, &quot;The Nature of Alexander.&quot; She is also a supporting character in &quot;Stealing Fire&quot;, a novel by Jo Graham about the immediate aftermath of Alexander&#x27;s death.

Thaïs is the heroine of a 1972 novel by the Russian author Ivan Efremov, &quot;Thaïs of Athens&quot;. It chronicles her life from meeting Alexander the Great through to her time as queen of Memphis in Egypt.

Other literary figures named Thaïs are references to Thaïs of Alexandria, a Christian saint of a later period, about whom a French novel and an opera were written.

<text>BBC Local Radio (also referred to as Local BBC Radio) is the BBC&#x27;s local and regional radio division for England and the Channel Islands, consisting of forty stations.

As of December 2023, the network broadcasts to a combined audience of 6.9 million, with a listening share of 4.9%, according to RAJAR.

==History==
The popularity of pirate radio was to challenge a then very &quot;stiff&quot; and blinkered management at the BBC. The most prominent concession by the BBC was the creation of BBC Radio 1 to satisfy the ever-demanding new youth culture with their thirst for new, popular music. The other, however, was that these pirate radio stations were, in some cases, local. As a result, BBC Local Radio began as an experiment.

Initially, stations had to be co-funded by the BBC and local authorities, which only some Labour-controlled areas proved willing to do. Radio Leicester was the first to launch on 8 November 1967, followed by Leeds, Stoke, Durham, Sheffield, Merseyside, Brighton, and Nottingham. The local authority funding requirement was dropped by the early 1970s, and stations spread across the country; many city-based stations later expanded their remit to cover an entire county.

There were eight stations in the initial &quot;experiment&quot;, which lasted for two years. When this ended, it was deemed so successful that all of the stations, except BBC Radio Durham, remained on air. More followed in 1970 and 1971: BBC Radio Birmingham, Bristol, Blackburn, Derby, Humberside, London, Manchester, Medway, Newcastle (replacing Radio Durham), Oxford, Solent, and Teesside.

Despite the success of this, the original stations were seen as flawed, as they originally only broadcast on the FM waveband, and not on the more widely available AM waveband. This was eventually rectified a few years after the creation of these new channels.

Independent Local Radio (ILR) launched nationally in 1973, with nineteen stations; more followed in subsequent years. As a result, many of the BBC Local Radio stations found themselves in direct competition with commercial competitors that utilised many of the popular DJs from the pirate radio stations, and that gained, in most cases, large audiences. Despite this, BBC Local Radio continued to flourish, and the 1980s and early 1990s saw the network expanded with a combination of new launches and existing city-based services expanded to include whole counties. By the mid-1990s this expansion concluded and since then, the complement of stations has remained unchanged.

BBC Local stations were never intended to broadcast around the clock but from launch, rather than each station&#x27;s frequency going silent, each station has carried another BBC station when not on air. Until the early 1990s BBC Radio 2 was carried due to it broadcasting a 24-hour service, although during the 1980s and early 1990s some stations carried output from BBC Radio 1 at various times, such as simulcasting Radio 1&#x27;s Top 40 programme on Sunday afternoons. During the mid-1990s many stations switched to carrying the BBC World Service and by the end of the 1990s all stations began carrying BBC Radio 5 Live during their downtime.

The 1980s also saw an expansion of programming hours but stations had still handed over to Radio 2 by early evening. This was seen as unacceptable by the BBC so the decision was taken to begin the roll-out of regional evening programming which saw the same programme networked on all the stations in that area. Consequently, stations were now provided local/regional programming on weeknights, and in many areas at the weekend as well, until midnight. 

==Current operation==
The radio stations are operated from locations around the country that usually share with the BBC regional TV news services, and their news gathering bureaux. The stations are operated by the region in which the station is based and are the responsibility of the BBC English Regions department, a division of BBC News.

The remit for each Local Radio station is the same: to offer a primarily speech-based service; comprising news and information complemented by music. The target audience of BBC Local Radio is listeners aged over fifty, who are not served as well as other age groups on the BBC.

Each station produces local programmes on weekdays from 6am until 2pm. Depending on location and population, afternoon, evening and weekend schedules will vary from shared regional programmes to being fully local although sports coverage continues to remain local. Since October 2023, all stations take the all England Late Show which originates in London or Manchester. and since November 2023, the Sunday evening show is also carried on all stations. 

All local BBC radio stations simulcast BBC Radio 5 Live from 0100 until 0600.

==Transmission==
All of the BBC Local Radio stations broadcast on FM, digital radio, Freeview and BBC Sounds in their respective areas across England, but BBC Radio London is also available on Sky UK, Freesat and Virgin Media.

Also, until the start of the 1990s, all BBC stations used to broadcast on medium wave although initially, the BBC&#x27;s local stations were broadcast only on VHF. The start of the 1990s saw new stations, once again, launching only on FM and in 1992 and 1993, six MW transmitters - BBC Radio Cleveland, BBC Radio Northampton, BBC Radio Oxford, BBC GLR, BBC GMR and one of BBC Radio Nottingham and BBC WM&#x27;s transmitters - were switched off although three, including BBC GLR&#x27;s MW frequency, were re-allocated for use by commercial radio. In 1996, the MW frequencies of BBC Radio Leicester and BBC WM were handed over to the BBC Asian Network.

MW transmitter closures began again in 2012, initially as a five-week trial to find out if listeners would miss or complain about the lack of AM services. Two of the four transmitters partaking in the trial - BBC Radio Nottingham&#x27;s MW transmitter and BBC Radio Kent&#x27;s relay at Rusthall near Tunbridge Wells - remained off-air after the BBC said that the trial switch-off attracted very few complaints from listeners. In 2018, the MW transmissions of BBC Radios Sussex, Surrey, Humberside, Wiltshire, Nottingham, Kent and Lincolnshire ended and MW coverage for Radios Devon, Lancashire and Essex was reduced. Altogether, thirteen MW transmitters were switched off. In 2020, the MW transmissions of BBC Radio Cornwall, BBC Radio Newcastle, BBC Radio Merseyside, BBC Radio Solent, BBC Three Counties Radio and BBC Radio York ended, BBC Radio Cumbria stopped broadcasting on MW in Whitehaven and BBC Radio Norfolk&#x27;s Norwich MW transmitter went silent. In 2021, a further eight BBC Local Radio stations - BBC Essex, BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, BBC Radio Devon, BBC Radio Leeds, BBC Radio Sheffield, BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester, BBC Radio Stoke and BBC Radio Lancashire - stopped broadcasting on MW. As of May 2024, only BBC Radio Cumbria (in North Cumbria and South Cumbria), BBC Radio Derby, BBC Radio Gloucestershire, BBC Radio Guernsey, BBC Radio Jersey, BBC Radio Norfolk (in West Norfolk) and BBC Radio Somerset, still broadcast on MW.

Due to sports rights broadcasting restrictions, some commentaries are not available on BBC Sounds. In this instance, an alternative national programme will usually be broadcast on Saturday afternoons. Overnight events are replaced by a looping message explaining this is broadcast.

==Stations==
A list of the forty local radio stations by region. In addition to these stations, BBC Radio Solent operates an opt-out service covering Dorset. There were also opt-out services covering Milton Keynes (BBC Three Counties Radio), Peterborough and the Fens (BBC Radio Cambridgeshire), Plymouth (BBC Radio Devon), and Swindon (BBC Wiltshire); but these ceased in 2012 due to cutbacks as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Delivering Quality First&quot; programme.

The stations were launched progressively; starting with BBC Radio Leicester on 8 November 1967, with the last station to launch being the short-lived BBC Dorset FM on 26 April 1993. Since then, many stations have been merged and renamed but no new stations have been created where no service previously existed, as plans to launch stations in unserved areas, most notably in Cheshire, have not materialised.

==Imaging==
Between October 2009 and April 2012, a three note jingle package produced by Mcasso Music Production was gradually rolled out across the network, and was in use by all BBC Local Radio stations. Mcasso also updated the imaging in October 2015 which was launched by BBC Radio London (on the day of the station&#x27;s 45th anniversary) replacing the three-note package with a six-note package.

In January 2020, BBC Radio Leicester launched a brand new custom-made jingle package by Reelworld, based in MediaCity UK, Salford. The new jingle package was rolled out to all BBC Local Radio stations over the course of the year, alongside a refreshed &quot;on air&quot; sound to help encourage younger listeners to the station. The new station branding also incorporates a new tag line, &quot;The Sound of *area of coverage*, and all the music you love&quot;. The new jingle package marked the first time in ten years that &quot;sung jingles&quot; were used in the stations&#x27; on air branding.

==Dave and Sue==
Dave and Sue are two fictional radio listeners created as marketing personas. Descriptions of the characters, created by the BBC, were given to all their local radio presenters as representative target listeners during the 2000s. They were later superseded by the &quot;BBC Local Radio 2010&quot; strategy.

The characters were created as part of &quot;Project Bullseye&quot;. Its stated aim was &quot;To develop great radio programming ... we need to know where the centre of our audience target is and be able to focus on it in all we do.&quot;

Dave and Sue are both 55. Sue is a school secretary, while Dave is a self-employed plumber. They are both divorcees with grown-up children. The characters shop at Asda, and wear casual clothes. The couple have little interest in high culture, or politics, and see the world as &quot;a dangerous and depressing place&quot;. They hope that radio will be &quot;something that will cheer them up and make them laugh&quot;.

BBC Local Radio staff were given facts and timelines about Dave and Sue, described as &quot;composite listeners&quot;. Staff were asked to focus on producing something to which the pair would enjoy listening to.

The BBC also produced photographs of the couple, to encourage presenters to visualise their potential listeners. At the 2005 Frank Gillard Awards for BBC Local Radio, the corporation hired two actors to represent the fictional couple and award a prize to the &quot;Receptionist of the Year&quot;.

Mia Costello of BBC Radio Solent wrote a controversial internal memo in October 2006, re-stating the importance of these characters. She wrote: &quot;Whatever job you do on station, make sure this week, you broadcast to Dave and Sue – people in their fifties. Only put on callers sounding in the 45–64 range. I don&#x27;t want to hear really elderly voices. Only talk about things that are positive and appealing to people in this age range. Only do caller round ups about people in this age range.&quot; This was reprinted the following month in the &quot;Southern Daily Echo&quot;, following which a BBC spokesperson commented &quot;Out of context these notes sound harsh and we apologise if they offend anyone.&quot;

<text>The Northrop X-4 Bantam is a prototype small twinjet aircraft manufactured by Northrop Corporation in 1948. It had no horizontal tail surfaces, depending instead on combined elevator and aileron control surfaces (called elevons) for control in pitch and roll attitudes, almost exactly in the manner of the similar-format, rocket-powered Messerschmitt Me 163 of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Luftwaffe. Some aerodynamicists had proposed that eliminating the horizontal tail would also do away with stability problems at fast speeds (called shock stall) resulting from the interaction of supersonic shock waves from the wings and the horizontal stabilizers. The idea had merit, but the flight control systems of that time prevented the X-4 from achieving any success.

==Development==
Two X-4s were built by the Northrop Corporation, but the first was found to be mechanically unsound and after ten flights it was grounded and used to provide parts for the second. 
While being tested from 1950 to 1953 at the NACA High-Speed Flight Research Station (now Edwards Air Force Base), the X-4&#x27;s semi-tailless configuration exhibited inherent longitudinal stability problems (porpoising) as it approached the speed of sound. It was concluded that (with the control technology available at the time) tailless craft were not suited for transonic flight.

It was believed in the 1940s that a design without horizontal stabilizers would avoid the interaction of shock waves between the wing and stabilizers. These were believed to be the source of the stability problems at transonic speeds up to Mach 0.9. Two aircraft had already been built using a semi-tailless design—the rocket-powered Me 163B &quot;Komet&quot; flown in combat by Nazi Germany&#x27;s Luftwaffe in World War II, and the turbojet-powered British de Havilland DH.108 Swallow built after the war. The United States Army Air Forces signed a contract with the Northrop Aircraft Company on 11 June 1946, to build two X-4s. Northrop was selected because of its experience with flying wing designs, such as the N-9M, XB-35 and YB-49 aircraft.

The resulting aircraft was very compact, only large enough to hold two Westinghouse J30 jet engines, a pilot, instrumentation, and a 45-minute fuel supply. Nearly all maintenance work on the aircraft could be done without using a ladder or footstool. A person standing on the ground could easily look into the cockpit. The aircraft also had split flaps, which doubled as speed brakes.

==Operational history==
The first X-4 (serial number 46-676) was delivered to Muroc Air Force Base, California, in November 1948. It underwent taxi tests and made its first flight on December 15, 1948, with Northrop test pilot Charles Tucker at the controls. Winter rains flooded Rogers Dry Lake soon after, preventing additional X-4 flights until April 1949. The first X-4 proved mechanically unreliable, and made only ten flights. Walter C. Williams, the head of the NACA Muroc Flight Test Unit (now Dryden Flight Research Center) called the aircraft a &quot;lemon&quot;. The second X-4 (serial number 46-677) was delivered during the halt of flights, and soon proved far more reliable. It made a total of 20 contractor flights. Despite this, the contractor flight program dragged on until February 1950, before both aircraft were turned over to the Air Force and the NACA. The first X-4 never flew again, used as spare parts for the second aircraft.

The NACA instrumented the second X-4 to conduct a short series of flights with Air Force pilots. These included Chuck Yeager, Frank Kendall Everest, Jr., Al Boyd, Richard Johnson, Fred Ascani, Arthur Murray and Jack Ridley. The flights were made in August and September 1950. The first flight by an NACA pilot was made by John H. Griffith on September 28, 1950.

The initial NACA X-4 flights, which continued from late 1950 through May of 1951, focused on the aircraft&#x27;s sensitivity to pitch. NACA pilots Griffith and Scott Crossfield noted that as the X-4&#x27;s speed approached Mach 0.88, it began a pitch oscillation of increasing severity, which was likened to driving on a washboard road. Increasing speeds also caused a tucking phenomenon, in which the nose pitched down, a phenomenon also experienced by the Me 163A &quot;Anton&quot; prototypes in 1941. More seriously, the aircraft also showed a tendency to &quot;hunt&quot; about all three axes. This combined yaw, pitch and roll, which grew more severe as the speed increased, was a precursor to the inertial coupling which would become a major challenge in the years to come.

To correct the poor stability, project engineers decided to increase the flap/speed brake trailing edge thickness. Balsa wood strips were added between the upper and lower hinged &quot;clamshell&quot;-style flap/speed brake halves, causing them to remain open at a 5° angle. The first test of the blunt trailing edge was flown on 20 August 1951 by NACA pilot Walter Jones. A second test was made by Crossfield in October. The results were positive, with Jones commenting that the X-4&#x27;s flight qualities had been greatly improved, and the aircraft did not have pitch control problems up to a speed of Mach 0.92.

The balsa strips were removed, and the X-4 then undertook a long series of flights to test landing characteristics. By opening the speed brakes, the lift-to-drag ratio of the aircraft could be reduced to less than 3:1. This was for data on future rocket-powered aircraft. The tests continued through October 1951, until wing tank fuel leaks forced the aircraft to be grounded until March 1952, when the landing tests resumed. NACA pilots Joe Walker, Stanley Butchard, and George Cooper were also checked out in the aircraft.

The thickened flap/speed brake tests had been encouraging, so balsa wood strips were reinstalled on both the flap/speed brake and the elevons. The first flight was made by Jones on 19 May 1952, but one of the engines was damaged during the flight, and it was August before a replacement J30 could be found. When the flights resumed, they showed that the modifications had improved stability in both pitch and yaw, and delayed the nosedown trim changes from Mach 0.74 to Mach 0.91. Above Mach 0.91, however, the X-4 still oscillated.

In May 1953, the balsa wood strips were again removed, and the X-4&#x27;s dynamic stability was studied in the original flap/speed brake and elevon configuration. These flights were made by Crossfield and John B. McKay. This was the final project for the X-4, which made its 81st and final NACA flight on September 29, 1953. Both aircraft survived the test program. The first X-4, AF serial number 46-676, was transferred to the United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado, before being returned to Edwards Air Force Base. 46-676 has been restored as of August 2012, and is currently being held in storage pending placement in the Edwards Museum. The second X-4 went to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, where it remains on display.

The X-4&#x27;s primary importance involved proving a negative, in that a swept-wing semi-tailless design was not suitable for speeds near Mach 1, although Vought&#x27;s F7U Cutlass proved to be something of a counterexample—the developed version was the first aircraft to demonstrate stores separation above Mach 1. Aircraft designers were thus able to avoid this dead end. It was not until the development of computer fly-by-wire systems that such designs could be practical. Semi-tailless designs appeared on the X-36, Have Blue, F-117, and Bird of Prey, although these aircraft all differed significantly in shape from the X-4. The trend during its test program was already towards delta and modified delta aircraft such as the Douglas F4D, the Convair F-102A derived from the XF-92A, and the Avro Vulcan.

<doc id="569411" wikidata="Q862819" url="?curid=569411" title="Stork-billed kingfisher">
<text>The stork-billed kingfisher (Pelargopsis capensis), is a tree kingfisher which is widely but sparsely distributed in the tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India to Indonesia. This kingfisher is resident throughout its range.

==Taxonomy==

The first formal description of the stork-billed kingfisher was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the 12th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He coined the binomial name &quot;Alcedo capensis&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on Mathurin Jacques Brisson&#x27;s &quot;Le martin-pescheur du Cap de Bonne Espérance&quot;. Brisson believed his specimen had come from the Cape of Good Hope region of South Africa. The species does not occur in Africa and it was suggested that the specimen had been obtained on the Indonesian island of Java. The specimen is now known to have come from near Chandannagar in West Bengal, India. Linnaeus&#x27;s specific epithet &quot;capensis&quot; denotes the Cape of Good Hope. The current genus &quot;Pelargopsis&quot; was introduced by the German zoologist Constantin Gloger in 1841.

Thirteen subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;P. c. capensis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – Nepal through India to Sri Lanka
* &quot;P. c. osmastoni&quot; (Baker, ECS, 1934) – Andaman Islands
* &quot;P. c. intermedia&quot; Hume, 1874 – Nicobar Islands
* &quot;P. c. burmanica&quot; Sharpe, 1870 – Myanmar to Indochina and south to north Malay Peninsula
* &quot;P. c. malaccensis&quot; Sharpe, 1870 – central and south Malay Peninsula, Riau Archipelago and Lingga Islands
* &quot;P. c. cyanopteryx&quot; (Oberholser, 1909) – Sumatra, Bangka Island and Belitung Island
* &quot;P. c. simalurensis&quot; Richmond, 1903 – Simeulue Island (off the west coast of the island of Sumatra in Indonesia)
* &quot;P. c. sodalis&quot; Richmond, 1903 – Banyak, Nias, Batu and Mentawai Islands (off the west coast of Sumatra)
* &quot;P. c. innominata&quot; (van Oort, 1910) – Borneo
* &quot;P. c. javana&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – Java
* &quot;P. c. floresiana&quot; Sharpe, 1870 – Bali to Flores (Lesser Sunda Islands)
* &quot;P. c. gouldi&quot; Sharpe, 1870 – north Philippines
* &quot;P. c. gigantea&quot; Walden, 1874 – central and south Philippines
The insular forms &quot;nesoeca&quot; on the Nias and Batu Islands as well as &quot;isoptera&quot; on Mentawai Island are here subsumed within &quot;sodalis&quot;. Prior to the change of type locality to Chandannagar, the birds in India were placed in the subspecies &quot;gurial&quot; but this race is now synonymized with the nominate race &quot;capensis&quot;.

==Description==
It is a very large kingfisher, measuring in length. The adult has a green back, blue wings and tail, and olive-brown head. Its underparts and neck are buff. The very large bill and legs are bright red. The flight of the stork-billed kingfisher is laboured and flapping, but direct. Sexes are similar. There are 13 races or subspecies, differing mostly in plumage detail, but &quot;P. c. gigantea&quot; of the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines has a white head, neck and underparts. 

==Habits==
The stork-billed kingfisher lives in a variety of well-wooded habitats near lakes, rivers, or coasts. It perches quietly whilst seeking food, and is often inconspicuous despite its size. It is territorial and will chase away eagles and other large predators. This species hunts fish, frogs, crabs, rodents and young birds.

Adults dig their nests in river banks, decaying trees, or tree termite nests. A clutch of two to five round white eggs is typical.

The call of this noisy kingfisher is a low and far reaching &quot;peer-por-por&quot; repeated about every 5 seconds, as well cackling &quot;ke-ke-ke-ke-ke-ke&quot;.

<text>Strachocina () is a village in Subcarpathian Voivodeship in the southeastern part of Poland. During the partitions of Poland, this region of the country belonged to Austria and was called Galicia. Today it contains about 300 houses and 1100 inhabitants, and is about 12 km2. It is the birthplace of St. Andrew Bobola.

Strachocina belongs to the Gmina Sanok in Sanok County. In earlier times the region was called Ziemia Sanocka (&quot;The Land of Sanok&quot;). Its capital was Sanok, which is still the largest town in the close neighborhood. Strachocina is situated around 11 km west.

Its foundation act, issued by King Casimir the Great, is dated on May 10, 1369. The further history of the village is unclear. At the place of today&#x27;s Strachocina once there were as much as four villages at the same time: Strachocina, Strachocina Wola, Szwanczyce and Meszewa.

Local tradition has it that there lived three kinds of people in the village: serfs (persons in a condition of feudal servitude, required to render services to a lord and attached to the lord&#x27;s land), tenants of the estate, and szlachta zaściankowa (village noblemen).

In 16th to 17th centuries tenants of the estate were Bobolas. One of their sons, Andrzej, was recognized a saint (a martyr) by the Roman Catholic Church. He was born in Strachocina in 1591. Today they show in the local church an old baptismal basin made of stone and assert that it was used to baptize the future saint. In a field chapel that was built in the 1990s there are celebrated solemnities dedicated to Saint Andrew.

At the border of the village there is a parish church of St. Catharina from the turn of 19th and 20th centuries. Near it one can find a monument of Saint Andrew, 600-year-old oak, a St. Maximilian cloister for nuns, and a newly built pilgrim&#x27;s hostel. The church is neo-gothic.

Since the end of 1980s, Strachocina has been the local center of the cult of St Andrew. Every May 16 there is a celebration attended by many pilgrims.

In the woods of Strachocina there is a natural gas reservoir and drilling area which is now used for the underground storage of natural gas from Russia. It is a stop on the Petroleum Trail.

<text>An environmental disaster or ecological disaster is defined as a catastrophic event regarding the natural environment that is due to human activity. This point distinguishes environmental disasters from other disturbances such as natural disasters and intentional acts of war such as nuclear bombings.

Environmental disasters show how the impact of humans&#x27; alteration of the land has led to widespread and/or long-lasting consequences. These disasters have included deaths of wildlife, humans and plants, or severe disruption of human life or health, possibly requiring migration. Some environmental disasters are the trigger source of more expansive environmental conflicts, where effected groups try to socially confront the actors responsible for the disaster.

==Environmental disasters==
Environmental disasters have historically affected agriculture, wildlife biodiversity, the economy, and human health. The most common causes include pollution that seeps into groundwater or a body of water, emissions into the atmosphere, and depletion of natural resources, industrial activity, and agricultural practices.

The following is a list of major environmental disasters: 
* Seveso disaster, 1976 – Release of dioxin in Italy by a small chemical manufacturing plant. The resulting contamination led to thousands of human hospitalizations, and the deaths of more than 25% of local fauna. To prevent the chemical from entering the food chain, the town culled over 80,000 animals. 
* Love Canal disaster, 1978 - Neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York that was contaminated by 21,000 tons of toxic chemicals, including at least twelve that are known carcinogens (halogenated organics, chlorobenzenes, and dioxin among them), from a former chemical waste dump site. President Carter declared a state of emergency in 1978, and it eventually led to the destruction of homes and relocation of more than 800 families. The effects of the disaster led to the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, better known as Superfund. The Love Canal Disaster is also credited as the start of the environmental activism movement in the United States.
* Amoco Cadiz oil spill, 1978 – The vessel broke in two, releasing its entire cargo of 1.6 million barrels (250,000 m3) of oil off the coast of Brittany, France. The amount of oil released totaled five times more than the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989.
* Ok Tedi environmental disaster, 1984 – , mine operators have discharged about two billion tons of tailings, overburden and mine-induced erosion into the Ok Tedi river system. About of forest has died or is under stress.
* Bhopal disaster, 1984 – Release of methyl isocyanate gas and other chemicals. Some estimate 8,000 people died within two weeks. A government affidavit in 2006 stated the leak caused 558,125 injuries including 38,478 temporary partial and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.
* Chernobyl disaster, 1986 – The official Soviet count of 31 deaths has been disputed. An UNSCEAR report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at 64 as of 2008. The eventual death toll could reach 4,000. Some 50 emergency workers died of acute radiation syndrome, nine children died of thyroid cancer and an estimated total of 3940 died from radiation-induced cancer and leukemia.
* Hanford Nuclear, 1986 – The U.S. government declassified 19,000 pages of documents indicating that between 1946 and 1986, the Hanford Site near Richland, Washington, released thousands of US gallons of radioactive liquids. Radioactive waste was both released into the air and flowed into the Columbia River (which flows to the ocean).
* Exxon Valdez oil spill, 1989 – An Exxon supertanker spilled of crude oil.
* Kuwait oil fires, 1991 – Iraqi forces set 600-700 oil wells ablaze in retaliation to Desert Storm, which lasted seven months.
* Hickory Woods, 1998 – Neighborhood in Buffalo, New York that was developed on land contaminated by leftover coke from steel production factories. The contamination was known to be an issue and repeatedly investigated, but continuously deemed safe for residents. Toxic materials found included elevated levels of arsenic, chromium, lead, mercury, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, naphthalene, dibenzofuran, and carbazole.
* Prestige oil spill, 2002 – Over of two different grades of heavy fuel oil were spilled off the coast of Galicia, Spain.
* Prudhoe Bay oil spill, 2006 – Up to of oil were spilled from a BP pipeline in Alaska.
* Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill, 2008 – of slurry spilled from a coal plant, covering 300 acres, flowing down several rivers, destroying homes and contaminating water. The volume spilled was over 7 times as much as the volume of oil spilled in the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
* Deepwater Horizon oil spill, 2010 – An explosion killed 11 men working on the platform and injured 34 others. The gushing wellhead was capped, after it had released about of crude oil.
* Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, 2011 – An energy accident initiated primarily by the tsunami following the Tōhoku earthquake on March 11, 2011. Immediately after the earthquake, the active reactors automatically shut down their sustained fission reactions. The insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns, hydrogen-air explosions, and the release of radioactive material. It was deemed a level 7 event classification of the International Nuclear Event Scale.
*Oder environmental disaster, 2022 – A contamination of river Oder from unknown origin that has led to a mass mortality event of the local sea life.
* Ohio train derailment, 2023 – A Norfolk Southern freight train carrying hazardous materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. The rail cars burned for several days, releasing chemicals into the air. Norfolk has been accused of mismanagement. 
* Red Sea crisis, 2024 — An long oil-spill during the United States–Houthi conflict in the Red Sea. 

=== Climate change and disaster risks ===

A 2013 report examined the relationship between disasters and poverty world-wide. It concludes that, without concerted action, there could be upwards of 325 million people living in the 49 countries most exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes in 2040.

==== Social vulnerability and environmental disaster ====
According to author Daniel Murphy, different groups can adapt to environmental disasters differently due to social factors such as age, race, class, gender, and nationality. Murphy argues that while developed countries with access to resources that can help mitigate environmental disasters often contribute the most to factors that can increase the risk of said disasters, developing countries experience the impacts of environmental disasters more intensely than their wealthier counterparts. It is often the case that the populations that do not contribute to climate change are not only in geographic locations that experience more environmental disasters, but also have fewer resources to mitigate the impact of the disasters. For example, when Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005, many scientists argued that climate change had increased the severity of the hurricane. Although the majority of the U.S. emissions that can contribute to climate change come from industry and transport, the people who were hit hardest by Katrina were not the heads of large companies within the country. Rather, the poor Black communities within Louisiana were the most devastated by the hurricane.

== Mitigation efforts ==
There have been many attempts throughout recent years to mitigate the impact of environmental disasters. Environmental disaster is caused by human activity, so many believe that such disasters can be prevented or have their consequences reduced by human activity as well. Efforts to attempt mitigation are evident in cities such as Miami, Florida, in which houses along the coast are built a few feet off of the ground in order to decrease the damage caused by rising tides due to rising sea-levels. Although mitigation efforts such as those found in Miami might be effective in the short-term, many environmental groups are concerned with whether or not mitigation provides long-term solutions to the consequences of environmental disaster.

<text>BBC Southern Counties Radio (BBC SCR) was the BBC Local Radio service for the English counties of Surrey and Sussex. The station also covered a large part of north-east Hampshire. It was the first BBC local radio station to introduce an all-speech format. It broadcast from studios in Brighton and Guildford on FM and AM, and on DAB on the NOW Sussex Coast multiplex.

==History==
The station was formed by the merger of BBC Radio Sussex and BBC Radio Surrey. It began on 1 August 1994.

BBC Radio Sussex had originally been founded on 14 February 1968 as BBC Radio Brighton, broadcasting from studios in Marlborough Place. Des Lynam was one of the original presenters. It expanded to cover the whole of Sussex in October 1983.

BBC Radio Surrey had a chequered history. Once planned as a stand-alone radio station, it eventually launched on 14 November 1991 as a limited opt-out service of BBC Radio Sussex, broadcasting from newly built studios on the campus of the University of Surrey in Guildford. However it was never able to build a substantial audience over its two years on air.

The two stations were merged in January 1994 and moved into the Guildford studios; a bone of contention for many Brighton residents who felt they were being deprived of the local station they had enjoyed since 1968. Their campaign to bring the station back to Brighton was to succeed twelve years later.

Initially called BBC Radio Sussex and Surrey, the station relaunched with the name BBC Southern Counties Radio on 1 August 1994. It became the first BBC local radio station to adopt an all-speech format, with the broadcast slogan &quot;all talk all the time&quot; and was on air daily from 5am to 1am. Presenters included Gordon Astley, Tommy Boyd, Peter Heaton-Jones, Al Clarke, Alison Taylor and Eric Dixon; however there were to be numerous presenter and schedule changes over the following three years.

The next revamp occurred on 1 September 1997, when the station reverted to a more traditional mix of talk and music, and introduced new presenters such as Chris Ashley, John Radford, Giles Dilnot, Bill Buckley and Simon Bates, who presented the Sunday morning show.

Further changes followed, including the departure in 2005 of Brighton Breakfast Show presenter JoAnne Good who left to work at BBC London 94.9 and was replaced by Sarah Gorrell. Good also left her Saturday morning show and was replaced by Brighton comedian Stephen Grant. Tommy Boyd was recruited, initially to present an adult-style programme on Saturday evenings.

The station was relaunched in April 2006. Its headquarters were relocated from Guildford to Brighton, and the station was referred to on air as &quot;The New Sound of Sussex and Surrey&quot;. Four of the presenters, Bill Buckley, John Radford, Ed Douglas and Dominic Busby left the station shortly before the relaunch of 2006. Three presenters were recruited and started broadcasting on the station on 3 April 2006, the day of the relaunch: Gordon Astley was taken on to present daily shows, just as he had done in the 1990s; Fred Marden was recruited to present the Surrey breakfast show; and one-time Radio Sussex sports reporter Richard Lindfield also rejoined. By early February 2009, all three had left the station and the designation &quot;The New Sound of Sussex and Surrey&quot; was no longer being used on air by presenters.

==BBC Sussex and BBC Surrey relaunch==
BBC SCR became BBC Sussex and BBC Surrey on 30 March 2009. Though the two stations broadcast on different frequencies, the infrastructure and management teams remained unaffected.

==Brighton Festival and Fringe==
Increasingly, in its latter years, BBC SCR worked to provide extensive and interactive coverage of the Brighton Festival and Fringe. Aside from dedicating a daily hour-long show to Brighton&#x27;s festivals, it also provided in-depth internet coverage, including reviews, features and video clips.

==Split programming==
From September 1997, there were separate news services for Sussex and Surrey, and separate breakfast shows for both counties, using a split frequency system. Until the April 2006 changes, a separate service for Brighton, Hove and Worthing was also provided. A one-hour drivetime programme and Saturday breakfast show for Surrey were introduced at this point - however the Surrey output was now only available to listeners in the west of the county, on 104.6 FM. The 104.0 FM frequency, which covers parts of both East Surrey and the north of West Sussex and previously carried the Surrey programming, was switched to carry the Sussex output. The reasoning behind this was to give listeners in Crawley and East Grinstead a more relevant service, at the expense of those in East Surrey where audience figures have been in decline, but from 16 October 2006, 104.0 FM reverted to the Surrey output. In addition, to reaffirm its commitment to Surrey listeners, the Surrey drivetime programme was increased from one to three hours.

There were also separate sports shows on Saturday afternoon, allowing listeners in north-east Hampshire and Surrey could listen to live commentaries from the local Conference teams, Aldershot Town, Woking and Crawley Town, whilst listeners in Sussex could listen to Brighton&#x27;s games.

==&quot;Top Gear&quot;==
On Wednesday 26 April 2006, &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond presented the drivetime show from the Brighton studio. The feature was broadcast in the second episode of Series 8 on 14 May 2006.

==Networked and simulcast programming==
Evening programming throughout the week was networked with counterpart BBC local radio stations in the south and south east (namely Radio Solent, Radio Berkshire, Radio Oxford and Radio Kent). During the station&#x27;s downtime, SCR simulcasted BBC Radio 5 Live programming including &quot;Up All Night&quot;, &quot;Morning Reports&quot; and the Stephen Nolan show.

<doc id="569418" wikidata="Q1063501" url="?curid=569418" title="Reflex arc">
<text>A reflex arc is a neural pathway that controls a reflex. In vertebrates, most sensory neurons do not pass directly into the brain, but synapse in the spinal cord. This allows for faster reflex actions to occur by activating spinal motor neurons without the delay of routing signals through the brain. The brain will receive the input while the reflex is being carried out and the analysis of the signal takes place after the reflex action.

There are two types: autonomic reflex arc (affecting inner organs) and somatic reflex arc (affecting muscles). Autonomic reflexes sometimes involve the spinal cord and some somatic reflexes are mediated more by the brain than the spinal cord.

During a somatic reflex, nerve signals travel along the following pathway:
# &quot;Somatic receptors&quot; in the skin, muscles and tendons
# &quot;Afferent nerve fibers&quot; carry signals from the somatic receptors to the posterior horn of the spinal cord or to the brainstem
# An &quot;integrating center&quot;, the point at which the neurons that compose the gray matter of the spinal cord or brainstem synapse
# &quot;Efferent nerve fibers&quot; carry motor nerve signals from the anterior horn to the muscles
# &quot;Effector&quot; muscle innervated by the efferent nerve fiber carries out the response. 
A reflex arc, then, is the pathway followed by nerves which (a.) carry sensory information from the receptor to the spinal cord, and then (b.) carry the response generated by the spinal cord to effector organs during a reflex action.
The pathway taken by the nerve impulse to accomplish a reflex action is called the reflex arc.

==Monosynaptic vs. polysynaptic==

When a reflex arc in an animal consists of only one sensory neuron and one motor neuron, it is defined as monosynaptic, referring to the presence of a single chemical synapse. In the case of peripheral muscle reflexes (patellar reflex, achilles reflex), brief stimulation to the muscle spindle results in contraction of the agonist or effector muscle.
By contrast, in polysynaptic reflex pathways, one or more interneurons connect afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) signals. All but the most simple reflexes are polysynaptic, allowing processing or inhibition of polysynaptic reflexes within the brain.

== The patellar reflex (aka &quot;knee jerk&quot;) ==

When the patellar tendon is tapped just below the knee, the tap initiates an action potential in a specialized structure known as a muscle spindle located within the quadriceps. This action potential travels to the L3 and L4 nerve roots of the spinal cord,
via a sensory axon which chemically communicates by releasing glutamate onto a motor nerve. The result of this motor nerve activity is contraction of the quadriceps muscle, leading to extension of the lower leg at the knee (i.e. the lower leg kicks forward). Ultimately, an improper patellar reflex may indicate an injury of the central nervous system.

The sensory input from the quadriceps also activates local interneurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine onto motor neurons of antagonist muscles, blocking their stimulation (in this case the hamstring muscles). The relaxation of the opposing muscle facilitates (by not opposing) the extension of the lower leg.

In invertebrates reflex interneurons do not necessarily reside in the spinal cord, for example as in the lateral giant neuron of crayfish.

<text>GLV and BCV are Australian television stations licensed to serve Traralgon, Bendigo and the region of Victoria. The stations are owned and operated by Network 10.

==History==

===Early years===
GLV-10 in Traralgon was the first regional television station to launch in Australia on 9 December 1961, originally covering the Gippsland and Latrobe Valley areas. It was also the first station to completely use Australian-made broadcasting equipment from Amalgamated Wireless Australasia. The original transmission equipment consisted of a 10 kW and 2 kW transmitter (standby) which was based on the RCA product and adapted to 230 V 50 Hz by AWA. The Melbourne pickup was a Rhode and Schwarz off-air receiver with AWA return microwave links to the Studio. BCV-8 first went to air two weeks later, on 23 December 1961(the same day as the launch of GMV-6 Shepparton), serving Bendigo and Central Victoria.

On 25 March 1970, BCV-8 was off the air for 45 minutes. The incident was caused by two mice who got into the transmitter&#x27;s high-voltage cables, short circuiting the main circuit and the switchboard.

===Affiliations===
GLV pioneered the use of live, &quot;off-air&quot; relays of television programs from stations in Melbourne, including GTV-9&#x27;s hugely popular &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot;. Since the station had no video recording equipment, engineers needed to rely on picking up the original signal at the transmitter site to relay back to the studio. As the sole commercial television station in the region, GLV&#x27;s program lineup included local output such as news and children&#x27;s programs, combined with programs selected from Melbourne&#x27;s commercial stations – the Nine Network, Seven Network (HSV-7), and from 1964, Network Ten (ATV-0).

An affiliation formed between the two stations and STV-8 Mildura in the 1970s as the Victorian Broadcasting Network, adopting the name of a former statewide radio network and later as Television Centre of Victoria. In 1982, the three stations merged as the Southern Cross TV8 television network, sharing a common stylised flag logo and programming schedule. Seven years later it was renamed the Southern Cross Network. STV-8 split from the network in 1990 when the station joined the then-Television Victoria network, as Mildura was not included in the Victorian aggregation plan.

===From GLV-10 to GLV-8===
On 17 January 1980, GLV-10 changed frequencies from VHF channel 10 to 8 to allow neighbouring Melbourne television station ATV-0 to move to the original frequency three days later to eliminate interference problems on VHF-0. Channels 8 and 10 became Channel 8 as a result of the switch.
===Aggregation===
When aggregation in regional Victoria took place between 1992 and 1993, the Southern Cross Network expanded to Shepparton, Ballarat and Albury as an affiliate of Network 10. By September 1993, the network had changed its name and logo to SCN TV, and then again in May 1994 to Ten Victoria, which coincided with the cancellation of the station&#x27;s local news service (&quot;SCN TV News at Six&quot;), replaced by ATV-10&#x27;s &quot;Ten News at 5&quot;.

===21st century developments===
On 1 July 2016, Southern Cross switched its primary affiliation from Network Ten to the Nine Network in Queensland, Southern NSW, ACT, South Australia, and Victoria. The Southern Cross Ten branding was retired and replaced by generic Nine branding.

On 1 July 2021, Southern Cross switched back its primary affiliation from the Nine Network to Network 10 and airs programs from ATV in Melbourne.

On 17 December 2024, Southern Cross Austereo announced the sale of their regional television licenses in Regional Queensland, Southern NSW/ACT and Regional Victoria over to their affiliate Network 10. The sale was completed on 1 March 2025.

===News and current affairs===
GLV/BCV broadcasts 10 News First with Jennifer Keyte from ATV-10.

==== History ====
Between 21 March 2011 and 19 June 2015, viewers in Shepparton and the Goulburn Valley received a trial regional news magazine program called &quot;Weeknights&quot; at 6:30pm on weekdays.

Given its 1 July 2016 affiliate switch to the Nine Network, news updates were upgraded to a full bulletin relaunch as &quot;Nine Local News&quot; by March 2017. The new SC9 served as the Nine News regional broadcaster to regional Victoria viewers, with the state and local level news provided by GTV-9 in Melbourne.

The bulletins&#x27; formats were stylistically similar to the Nine-owned &quot;NBN News&quot; bulletin in northern New South Wales as a composite of international, national, and local news. 

On 17 March 2020, production on the composite bulletins, including Victoria, were suspended indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with reporters deployed to the metropolitan bulletins in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane.

As of 1 July 2021, Southern Cross broadcasts 10 News First, broadcast from ATV&#x27;s studios, with Keyte from Melbourne at 5:00pm and &quot;The Project&quot; at 6:30pm on weekdays and Sundays. Since 1 August 2021, Sky News Australia content has been offered in regional Victoria and on the channel Sky News Regional via GLV/BCV.

<text>BBC Radio Berkshire is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Berkshire. It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds. It has studios at Thames Valley Park near Reading.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 33,700 listeners as of February 2025.

==History==
BBC Radio Berkshire was launched on 21 January 1992 as a part-time station, broadcasting for part of the weekday and weekend mornings with BBC Radio Oxford carried at all other times. Due to financial cutbacks, BBC Director-General John Birt announced that the station was to fully merge with BBC Radio Oxford on 9 April 1996 to become BBC Thames Valley FM. On 14 February 2000, the two stations became separate once again.

In November 2018, BBC Radio Berkshire moved from Caversham Park House – which the station shared with BBC Monitoring – to new purpose-built studios at Thames Valley Park on the outskirts of Reading.

==Awards==
BBC Radio Berkshire was named Station of the Year in the 2012 Frank Gillard Awards, also winning in the Sports Coverage category for its coverage of Olympic rowing at Eton Dorney. Andrew Peach won silver in both the Programme Presenter and The Ultimate Hot Seat categories.

In the 2013 Sony Radio Academy Awards, the Andrew Peach programme won bronze in the category Breakfast Show of the Year (under 10 million).

The Andrew Peach Show was named Best Local Radio Show in the UK at the 2021 Radio Academy ARIA Awards.

==Technical==

The Hannington transmitter for BBC Radio Berkshire&#x27;s 104.1 FM frequency is located on Cottington Hill (close to Watership Down). The 104.1 FM signal can be heard over most of Hampshire, certainly more than BBC Radio Solent. The 104.4 FM signal comes from the Fountain House transmitter in Reading. The 94.6 FM signal comes from the Henley-on-Thames transmitter. The 95.4 FM signal comes from the Windsor transmitter.

Since 31 July 2004, DAB broadcasts have come from the NOW Digital Berkshire &amp; North Hampshire 12D multiplex from Coppid Beech (at the junction of the B3408 and A329(M) in west Bracknell), Hannington and Hemdean (just north of Caversham). The Basingstoke DAB transmitter (between Cliddesden and Winslade near the A339 in Hampshire) was added on 3 October 2005.

Since June 2016, the station has been available on Freeview TV channel 711 in the BBC South and BBC London regions. It also streams online via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Reading studios from 6 am to 10 pm on Sundays to Fridays and from 6 am to 6 pm and 8 pm to 10 pm on Saturdays.

Some off-peak programming originates from BBC Radio Solent in Southampton. The station usually broadcasts the whole of the Late Night programme, a programme carried by all BBC local radio stations (except in the case of sports coverage), which is broadcast between 10pm and 1am.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Berkshire simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live

== History ==
It was founded in 1673 with the (shop name) , selling kimono. Ten years later in 1683, Echigoya took a new approach to marketing. Instead of selling by going door-to-door, they set up a store where buyers could purchase goods on the spot with cash. Mitsukoshimae Station on the Tokyo Metro is named after the adjacent Mitsukoshi department store.

Mitsukoshi is the root of Mitsui group. In the 1970s, Mitsukoshi bought the Oriental Nakamura department store in Nagoya and re-branded them as .

Genichiro Inokuma designed the wrapping paper in white and red.

In August 2007, it was announced that Mitsukoshi would merge into Isetan, a major department store in Japan. Mitsukoshi was unlisted on March 26, 2008, and on April 1, it merged with Isetan under a joint holding company called Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd. ().

On April 5, 2019, Mitsukoshi announced that it would further expand its Asian presence by having a Filipino branch established by 2021 at Bonifacio Global City, in Taguig, Metro Manila, Philippines. The store opened on November 18, 2022.

<text>In physiology, transduction is the translation of arriving stimulus into an action potential by a sensory receptor. It begins when stimulus changes the membrane potential of a sensory receptor.

A sensory receptor converts the energy in a stimulus into an electrical signal. Receptors are broadly split into two main categories: exteroceptors, which receive external sensory stimuli, and interoceptors, which receive internal sensory stimuli.

==Sensory transduction==

===The visual system===

In the visual system, sensory cells called rod and cone cells in the retina convert the physical energy of light signals into electrical impulses that travel to the brain. The light causes a conformational change in a protein called rhodopsin. This conformational change sets in motion a series of molecular events that result in a reduction of the electrochemical gradient of the photoreceptor. The decrease in the electrochemical gradient causes a reduction in the electrical signals going to the brain. Thus, in this example, more light hitting the photoreceptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses, effectively communicating that stimulus to the brain. A change in neurotransmitter release is mediated through a second messenger system. The change in neurotransmitter release is by rods. Because of the change, a change in light intensity causes the response of the rods to be much slower than expected (for a process associated with the nervous system).

===The auditory system===

In the auditory system, sound vibrations (mechanical energy) are transduced into electrical energy by hair cells in the inner ear. Sound vibrations from an object cause vibrations in air molecules, which in turn, vibrate the ear drum. The movement of the eardrum causes the bones of the middle ear (the ossicles) to vibrate. These vibrations then pass into the cochlea, the organ of hearing. Within the cochlea, the hair cells on the sensory epithelium of the organ of Corti bend and cause movement of the basilar membrane. The membrane undulates in different sized waves according to the frequency of the sound. Hair cells are then able to convert this movement (mechanical energy) into electrical signals (graded receptor potentials) which travel along auditory nerves to hearing centres in the brain.

===The olfactory system===

In the olfactory system, odorant molecules in the mucus bind to G-protein receptors on olfactory cells. The G-protein activates a downstream signalling cascade that causes increased level of cyclic-AMP (cAMP), which trigger neurotransmitter release.

===The gustatory system===

In the gustatory system, perception of five primary taste qualities (sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami [savoriness] ) depends on taste transduction pathways, through taste receptor cells, G proteins, ion channels, and effector enzymes.

===The somatosensory system===

In the somatosensory system the sensory transduction mainly involves the conversion of the mechanical signal such as pressure, skin compression, stretch, vibration to electro-ionic impulses through the process of mechanotransduction. It also includes the sensory transduction related to thermoception and nociception.

<text>Susan Orlean (born October 31, 1955) is an American journalist, television writer, and bestselling author of &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; and &quot;The Library Book&quot;. She has been a staff writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; since 1992, and has contributed articles to many magazines including &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and &quot;Outside&quot;. In 2021, Orlean joined the writing team of HBO comedy series &quot;How To with John Wilson&quot;.

Orlean&#x27;s 1998 non-fiction book &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; was adapted into the film &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002). Meryl Streep received an Academy Award nomination for her performance as Orlean.

==Early life==
Orlean born in Cleveland, Ohio, and was raised in nearby Shaker Heights, the daughter of Edith (née Gross 1923–2016) and Arthur Orlean (1915–2007). She has a sister and a brother. Her family is Jewish. Her mother&#x27;s family is from Hungary and her father&#x27;s family from Poland. Her father was an attorney and businessman.

Orlean graduated from the University of Michigan with honors in 1976, studying literature and history. After college she moved to Portland, Oregon, and was planning on going to law school, when she began writing for the &quot;Willamette Week&quot;.

==Career==
Orlean has published stories in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot; and &quot;Spy&quot;. In 1982, she became a staff writer for the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; and later a regular contributor to the &quot;Boston Globe Sunday Magazine&quot;. Her first book, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, was published in 1990, shortly after she moved to New York City from Boston and began writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. She started contributing to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1987 and became a staff writer in 1992.

Orlean authored the book &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;, a profile of Florida orchid grower, breeder and collector John Laroche. The book formed the basis of Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s script for the Spike Jonze film &quot;Adaptation.&quot; Orlean (portrayed by Meryl Streep, who won a Golden Globe for the performance) was, in effect, made into a fictional character. The movie portrayed her becoming Laroche&#x27;s lover and partner in a drug production operation, in which orchids were processed into a psychoactive substance.

In 1998, Orlean&#x27;s article &quot;Life&#x27;s Swell&quot; was published in &quot;Women&#x27;s Outside&quot;. The article, a feature on a group of young surfer girls in Maui, become the basis of the film &quot;Blue Crush&quot;.

In 1999, she co-wrote &quot;The Skinny: What Every Skinny Woman Knows About Dieting (And Won&#x27;t Tell You!)&quot; under her married name, Susan Sistrom. Her previously published magazine stories have been compiled in two collections, &quot;The Bullfighter Checks Her Makeup: My Encounters with Extraordinary People&quot; and &quot;My Kind of Place: Travel Stories from a Woman Who&#x27;s Been Everywhere&quot;. She also served as editor for &quot;Best American Essays 2005&quot; and &quot;Best American Travel Writing 2007&quot;. She contributed the Ohio chapter in &quot;State By State&quot; (2008), and in 2011 she published a biographical history of the dog actor Rin Tin Tin titled &quot;Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend&quot;.

When Orlean&#x27;s son had a school assignment to interview a city employee, he chose a librarian and together they visited the Studio City branch of the Los Angeles Public Library system which reignited her own childhood passion for libraries. After an immersive project involving three years of research and two years of writing on the 1986 fire at the Los Angeles Central Library, &quot;The Library Book&quot; was released in October 2018. The book uses the context of the April 1986 fire to explore the role of the public library, who uses them, and the void created if they are lost. Orlean hired a fact-checker to ensure the book was accurate, explaining &quot;I don&#x27;t want a substantial error that changes the meaning of my book, but I also don&#x27;t want silly errors&quot;. She collaborated on the adaption for television.

In 2021, Orlean joined the writing staff of television series &quot;How To with John Wilson&quot; for the show&#x27;s second season on HBO.

==Personal life==
Orlean married lawyer Peter Sistrom (1955–2021) in 1983, and they divorced after 16 years of marriage. She was introduced by a friend to author and businessman John Gillespie, whom she married in 2001, and she gave birth to their son in 2004.

She is also step-mother to John&#x27;s son from his previous marriage.

Orlean is a self-confessed &quot;maniac about architecture.&quot; In 2017, she sold a Mid-Century Modern home in Studio City, California that was designed by architect Rudolph Schindler.

==Awards and honors==
Orlean was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 2004. She received an honorary Doctor of Human Letters degree from the University of Michigan at the spring commencement ceremony in 2012. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2014 in the &quot;General Nonfiction&quot; field of study. Orlean was the winner of the 7th Annual Shorty Awards in the Author category, which honors the best social and digital media.

<text>Jampa Tsering (; ) was a Chinese singer and dancer. He is of Tibetan ethnicity.

Born in Lhasa in the early 1960s, Jampa Tsering became famous in the late 1980s and early 1990s, releasing an immensely popular album, &quot;Gnas mchog gi glu dbyangs (Songs of the Holy Land)&quot;, including songs such as &quot;Aro Khampa&quot; (&quot;Hey, Khampa&quot;); &quot;Ngai tsewai Lhasa&quot; (&quot;My Beloved Lhasa&quot;); and &quot;Cha chig yinna samchung&quot; (&quot;I Wished, If Only I Was A Bird&quot;).

Jampa Tsering studied music in the Shanghai Conservatoire for about seven years, learning piano. He was a member of the Tibet Song-and-Dance Ensemble, but began to gain a following in Lhasa from singing in karaoke and nangma bars. For this and his private singing, he was eventually expelled from the dance troupe. He assimilated much of the style of 1980s Chinese language pop into his singing and the synthesised orchestral accompaniments of his songs. He was clearly a product of the new media rather than traditional Tibetan singing, using a soft crooning voice rather than the loud, projecting voice of traditional Tibetan singing, yet the melodies of the songs he sang inherited a strong Tibetan character, with their wide vocal range and long phrases. 

Many of his songs have hidden political meanings, such as &quot;Ri de Himalaya&quot; (&quot;Himalaya Mountains&quot;), and they all express a strong pride in Tibetan identity, Tibetan traditions and the Tibetan countryside. Some of Jampa Tsering&#x27;s songs were restricted in Lhasa in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to their political nature.

Jampa Tsering died in a car crash in 1997.

This article is a slightly modified version of the article on Jampa Tsering from &quot;Unity and discord: Music and politics in contemporary Tibet&quot; (2004, Tibet Information Network, ).</text><links>

<text>Heckmondwike is a town in the Kirklees district, West Yorkshire, England, south west of Leeds. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is close to Cleckheaton and Liversedge. It is in the Spen Valley parliamentary constituency, and had an estimated population of 16,986 at the 2011 Census increasing to 18,149 at the 2021 Census. Heckmondwike forms part of the Heavy Woollen District.

==Toponymy==
The origins of Heckmondwike are in Old English. First recorded as &quot;Hedmundewic&quot; in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, &quot;Hedmu&quot;n&quot;dewic&quot; in 1166, and as &quot;Hecmundewik&quot; sometime in the 13th century, the name seems to be from *&quot;Hēahmundes wīc&quot;, or &#x27;Heahmund&#x27;s dairy-farm&#x27;.

==History==
During Saxon times, Heckmondwike was a &quot;berewick&quot; or independent village in the manor of Gomersal, which, before 1066, was held by Dunstan and Gamel.

The Poll Tax of 1379 records seven families in Heckmondwike, about 35 people: including one named Thomas of Stubly. Most lived in isolated farmsteads such as Stubley Farm, on high ground overlooking the marshy Spen Valley floor.

In 1684, there were around 250 people, occupying 50 houses, in the town. The town became famous for manufacturing blankets, and by 1811 the Blanket Hall was built for trade in the town&#x27;s primary manufacture. It was replaced by a second hall erected in 1839, on Blanket Hall Street in the town centre. Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s biography of Charlotte Brontë in 1857 described the inhabitants of Heckmondwike as &quot;a chapel-going people, very critical of their sermons, tyrannical to their ministers and violent radicals&quot;.

The town ceased generating electricity in 1924. The Power Company buildings survive in part on Bath Road.
The remains of the first Blanket Hall were demolished in spring 2008, along with a number of other old buildings including some former Co-op buildings that had been used as the post office and former &quot;George&quot; public house.

A health centre was opened in July 2010 to house two former doctors&#x27; practices.

==Geography==

Located at the edge of the Pennine hills, the land rises to the north, east and south of the town centre. The town covers an area of one square mile (640 acres), the town boundary is not the same as the ward boundary.

Heckmondwike has a telephone exchange, north of High Street in the Wakefield 01924 dialling area. The exchange covers Liversedge, and parts of Dewsbury Moor and Staincliffe.

==Politics==
In 1894 Heckmondwike Urban District Council was established and was incorporated into Kirklees in the local government reorganisation of 1974. The Heckmondwike electoral ward includes Millbridge, Flush, and Norristhorpe in Liversedge south of the A62 road. Heckmondwike ward is represented on Kirklees Council by three Labour councillors.

In 2003 the ward elected David Exley of the British National Party, after the serving councillor left the Labour Party to run as an independent. Exley was re-elected in 2004, and in 2006 a second BNP member, Roger Roberts, was elected. Roberts had previously served as councillor for the Conservative Party. In May 2007 David Sheard (Labour), was returned. In May 2008 Exley lost his seat to Labour candidate Steve Hall. In May 2010 Roberts lost his seat to Labour candidate Viv Kendrick. Sheard was re-elected in 2011, and Hall was re-elected in 2012.

==Media==
The weekly newspaper was the &quot;Heckmondwike Herald&quot; until Friday 15 August 2008 after which the title was merged into the &quot;Spenborough Guardian&quot; incorporating the &quot;Heckmondwike Herald&quot;. It covers the former Spenborough Urban District and Heckmondwike.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds on 92.4 FM, Heart Yorkshire on 106.2 FM, Capital Yorkshire on 105.6 FM, Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 102.5 FM, Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 96.3 FM and Branch Radio, a community based radio station that broadcast from the Dewsbury on 101.8 FM.

==Transport==
The town has its own bus station. Very few bus services terminate at Heckmondwike; most are through services from across West Yorkshire including Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and Wakefield.

<doc id="569458" wikidata="Q534605" url="?curid=569458" title="Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt">
<text>Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt (born Maria Mercedes Morgan; 23 August 1904 13 February 1965) was an American socialite. Vanderbilt was the mother of fashion designer and artist Gloria Vanderbilt and maternal grandmother of television journalist Anderson Cooper. She was a central figure in &quot;Vanderbilt vs. Whitney&quot;, one of the most sensational American custody trials in the 20th century.

==Early life==

Born at the Grand Hotel National in Lucerne, Switzerland, as Maria Mercedes Morgan, she was a daughter of Henry Hays Morgan, Sr. (1860–1933), an American diplomat, who served as U.S. consul general in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Berlin, Germany; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Havana, Cuba; and Brussels, Belgium. Her mother was his second wife, the former Laura Delphine Kilpatrick (1877–1956); the couple was married in 1894 and divorced in 1927.

Her maternal grandfather, Hugh Judson Kilpatrick (1836–1881), was a Union Army general during the American Civil War, who also served as the U.S. minister to Chile. Her maternal grandmother, Luisa Kilpatrick, née Valdivieso Araoz, was a member of a wealthy Chilean family that had emigrated from Spain in the 17th century.

Morgan, who adopted the name Gloria as a teenager, had five siblings:

* Laura Consuelo Morgan (17 December 1901 – 26 August 1979), aka Tamar. She married Count Jean de Maupas du Juglart, Ambassador Benjamin Thaw Jr., and Alfons B. Landa (née Alfonso Beaumont Howard Landa).
* Thelma Morgan (1904–1970), her identical twin. She became a mistress of Edward, Prince of Wales and married James Vail Converse and Marmaduke Furness, 1st Viscount Furness.
* Harry Hays Morgan Jr. (1898–1983), who became a film actor. He was married to Ivor Elizabeth O&#x27;Connor, Edith Churchill Gordon, and Sybil Robertina &quot;Robin&quot; Boyce Willys.
* Constance Morgan (1887–1892), a half sister, a child of her father&#x27;s first marriage to Mary E. Edgerton.
* Gladys Morgan (14 September 1889 – 15 August 1958), another half sister from her father&#x27;s first marriage; she was known as Margaret and married Lieut. John W. Henderson in 1919 in New York.

Gloria Morgan was educated by governesses and in convents in Europe as well as New York City, where she attended the Catholic Convent of the Sacred Heart (in the Manhattanville section of the city), the Skerton Finishing School, and Miss Nightingale&#x27;s School. In October 1921, with their father&#x27;s permission, Morgan and her sister Thelma, both reportedly 16 years of age, ended their schooling and moved by themselves into an apartment at 40 Fifth Avenue, a private townhouse. The sisters had some minor roles in silent movies, using the names Gloria and Thelma Rochelle. Their debuts were as extras in the 1922 Marion Davies vehicle &quot;The Young Diana&quot;.

Known as &quot;The Magnificent Morgans&quot;, Gloria and Thelma Morgan were popular fixtures in the American high society, even as teenagers. British photographer Cecil Beaton described them as &quot;alike as two magnolias, and with their marble complexions, raven tresses, and flowing dresses, with their slight lisps and foreign accents, they diffuse a Ouida atmosphere of hothouse elegance and lacy femininity. ... Their noses are like begonias, with full-blown nostrils, their lips richly carved, and they should have been painted by Sargent, with arrogant heads and affected hands, in white satin with a bowl of white peonies near by.&quot;

==Marriage and widowhood==
On 6 March 1923, in New York City, at the townhouse of friends, Gloria Morgan — then 18 years of age and having received the legal consent of her father to wed — became the second wife of Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, age 42, an heir to the Vanderbilt railroad fortune.

On 20 February 1924, their only child, Gloria Laura, was born in New York City.

Reginald Vanderbilt died on 4 September 1925 of what was described in news reports as &quot;a throat infection which had caused internal hemorrhages&quot; or cirrhosis due to alcoholism. Following his death, his young widow became the administrator of a $2.5 million trust left to their daughter, Gloria, and spent the better part of the next six years living in Paris, Biarritz, and London, with her mother and child and often in the company of her sisters and brother, all of whom lived in France and England with their respective spouses.

However, the conditions of Vanderbilt&#x27;s will and the custody of their child were complicated by the general belief that his widow had not reached the legal age of majority, which meant that she required a guardian. Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt believed that she was 20, rather than 21, because her mother had long declared the twins&#x27; birth year as 1905 rather than 1904. The discrepancy was discovered upon an examination of the Morgan twins&#x27; childhood passports and their birth certificates during the Vanderbilt custody trial in 1934. No reason, however, was given as to the change of birth years. As Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt wrote in her 1936 memoirs, &quot;Without Prejudice&quot; (E P Dutton), &quot;Had I not thought myself a minor at this time ... there would have been no necessity for a guardian for myself ... [or] for a legal guardian for my child&#x27;s person ... On this untruth—irrevocable and irremediable—hinged the currents of my child&#x27;s life and my own.&quot;

==Custody trial==
Influenced by reports from private detectives as well as family servants and Laura Morgan (who appears by all published accounts to have been somewhat emotionally and mentally unbalanced and who testified on Mrs. Whitney&#x27;s side at the trial), members of the Vanderbilt family came to believe that Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt was a bad influence and neglectful of her daughter. A custody battle erupted that made national headlines in 1934. As a result of a great deal of hearsay evidence admitted at trial, the scandalous allegations of Vanderbilt&#x27;s lifestyle—including a purported lesbian relationship with Nadezhda de Torby, the Marchioness of Milford Haven, and a brief engagement to Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg—led to a new standard in tabloid newspaper sensationalism.

Vanderbilt lost custody of her daughter to her sister-in-law Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Granted limited parental rights, Vanderbilt was allowed to see young Gloria on weekends in New York. The court also removed Vanderbilt as administrator of her daughter&#x27;s trust fund, whose annual investment income had been her only source of support. Two years later, the custody issue was re-opened, giving her another chance to re-gain guardianship of her daughter. This time, the case was brought before the Supreme Court of the United States. The court declined to hear the matter and it once again came before the State of New York&#x27;s Supreme Court. The result was an agreement that Gloria would spend more time with her mother than was previously granted. In 1946, the widow was once more in the news when her daughter announced she would no longer be paying her mother an annual $21,000 allowance. Saying that her mother was able to work and had done so in the past, Gloria Vanderbilt stated the annual allowance would now be given to a charity for blind and starving children.

==Later years==
From the 1940s until their deaths, Gloria and her sister Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness lived together in New York City and in Los Angeles, California. They wrote a dual memoir called &quot;Double Exposure: A Twin Autobiography&quot;, published in 1958&quot;.&quot;

Vanderbilt died in 1965 of cancer and was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), also known commonly as the whitetail and the Virginia deer, is a medium-sized species of deer native to North, Central and South America. It is the most widely-distributed mainland ungulate herbivore in the Americas; coupled with its natural predator, the mountain lion (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), it is one of the most widely-distributed terrestrial mammal species in the Americas and the world. Highly adaptable, the various subspecies of white-tailed deer inhabit many different ecosystems, from arid grasslands to the Amazon and Orinoco basins; from the Pantanal and the Llanos to the high-elevation terrain of the Andes. Globally, the white-tailed deer has been introduced (primarily for sport hunting) to New Zealand, the Greater Antilles of the Caribbean (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico), and some countries in Europe (mainly the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Romania and Serbia). 

In North America, the white-tailed deer is very common (even considered a nuisance in some areas) in states to the east and south of the Rocky Mountains, including southwestern Arizona, with the exception of the American West Coast and Baja California Peninsula, where its ecological niche is filled by the black-tailed (in the Pacific Northwest) or mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;) from that point west except for mixed deciduous riparian corridors, river valley bottomlands, and lower foothills of the northern Rocky Mountain region from Wyoming west to eastern Washington and eastern Oregon and north to northeastern British Columbia and southern Yukon, including in the Montana valley and foothill grasslands. The westernmost population of the species, known as the Columbian white-tailed deer, was once widespread in the mixed forests along the Willamette and Cowlitz River valleys of western Oregon and southwestern Washington, but current numbers are considerably reduced, and it is classified as near-threatened by the IUCN. This population is separated from other white-tailed deer populations.

Texas is home to, by far, the most individual white-tailed deer of all U.S. states, Canadian provinces, or Latin American countries, with an estimated population of 5.3 million, with both wild deer and farmed herds, the latter raised for large rack size and breeding. High populations of white-tailed deer are known to exist on the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas, as well as in Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The conversion of land adjacent to the Canadian Rockies to agricultural use, and partial clear-cutting of coniferous trees (resulting in widespread deciduous vegetation), has been favorable to the white-tailed deer and has extended its distribution to as far northwest as the Yukon. Populations of white-tailed deer around the Great Lakes have expanded their range north and westward, also due to conversion of land to agricultural use, with local caribou, elk, and moose populations declining. White-tailed deer are crepuscular, meaning they are most active at dawn and dusk, sporadically resting throughout the day and night.

==Taxonomy==

Some taxonomists have attempted to separate white-tailed deer into a host of subspecies, based largely on morphological differences. Genetic studies, however, suggest fewer subspecies within the animal&#x27;s range, as compared to the 30 to 40 subspecies that some scientists have described in the last century. The Florida Key deer, &quot;O. v. clavium&quot;, and the Columbian white-tailed deer, &quot;O. v. leucurus&quot;, are both listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. In the United States, the Virginia white-tail, &quot;O. v. virginianus&quot;, is among the most widespread subspecies. Several local deer populations, especially in the southern United States, are descended from white-tailed deer transplanted from various localities east of the Continental Divide. Some of these deer populations may have been from as far north as the Great Lakes region to as far west as Texas, yet are also quite at home in the Appalachian and Piedmont regions of the south. These deer, over time, have intermixed with the local indigenous deer (&quot;O. v. virginianus&quot; and/or &quot;O. v. macrourus&quot;) populations.

Central and South America have a complex number of white-tailed deer subspecies that range from Guatemala to as far south as Peru. This list of subspecies of deer is more exhaustive than the list of North American subspecies, and the number of subspecies is also questionable. However, the white-tailed deer populations in these areas are difficult to study, due to overhunting in many parts and a lack of protection. Some areas no longer carry deer, so assessing the genetic difference of these animals is difficult.

==Description==


The white-tailed deer&#x27;s coat is a reddish-brown in the spring and summer, and turns to a grey-brown throughout the fall and winter. The white-tailed deer can be recognized by the characteristic white underside to its tail. It raises its tail when it is alarmed to warn the predator that it has been detected.

An indication of a deer&#x27;s age is the length of the snout and the color of the coat, with older deer tending to have longer snouts and grayer coats.

A population of white-tailed deer in New York is entirely white except for the nose and hooves – not albino – in color. The former Seneca Army Depot in Romulus, New York, has the largest known concentration of white deer. Strong conservation efforts have allowed white deer to thrive within the confines of the depot.

The white-tailed deer&#x27;s horizontally slit pupil allows for good night vision and color vision during the day. Whitetails process visual images at a much more rapid rate than humans and are better at detecting motion in low-light conditions.

===Size and weight===

The white-tailed deer is highly variable in size, generally following both Allen&#x27;s rule and Bergmann&#x27;s rule that the average size is larger farther away from the equator. North American male deer (also known as a buck) usually weigh , but mature bucks over have been recorded in the northernmost reaches of their native range, namely Minnesota, Ontario, and Manitoba. In 1926, Carl J. Lenander Jr. took a white-tailed buck near Tofte, Minnesota, that weighed after it was field-dressed (internal organs and blood removed) and was estimated at when alive. The female (doe) in North America usually weighs from . White-tailed deer from the tropics and the Florida Keys are markedly smaller-bodied than temperate populations, averaging , with an occasional adult female as small as . White-tailed deer from the Andes are larger than other tropical deer of this species and have thick, slightly woolly-looking fur. Length ranges from , including a tail of , and the shoulder height is . Including all races, the average summer weight of adult males is and is in adult females. It is among the largest deer species in North America, and is also one of the largest in South America, behind only the marsh deer.

Deer have dichromatic (two-color) vision with blue and yellow primaries; humans normally have trichromatic vision. Thus, deer poorly distinguish the oranges and reds that stand out so well to humans. This makes it very convenient to use deer-hunter orange as a safety color on caps and clothing to avoid accidental shootings during hunting seasons.

===Antlers===

Males regrow their antlers every year. About one in 10,000 females also has antlers, although this is usually associated with freemartinism. Bucks without branching antlers are often termed &quot;spikehorn&quot;, &quot;spiked bucks&quot;, &quot;spike bucks&quot;, or simply &quot;spikes/spikers&quot;. The spikes can be quite long or very short. Length and branching of antlers are determined by nutrition, age, and genetics. Rack growth tends to be very important from late spring until about a month before velvet sheds. Healthy deer in some areas that are well-fed can have eight-point branching antlers as yearlings (1.5 years old). Although antler size typically increases with age, antler characteristics (e.g., number of points, length, or thickness of the antlers) are not good indicators of buck age, in general, because antler development is influenced by the local environment. The individual deer&#x27;s nutritional needs for antler growth is dependent on the diet of the deer, particularly protein intake. Good antler-growth nutritional needs (calcium) and good genetics combine to produce wall trophies in some of their range. Spiked bucks are different from &quot;button bucks&quot; or &quot;nubbin&#x27; bucks&quot;, that are male fawns and are generally about six to nine months of age during their first winter. They have skin-covered nobs on their heads. They can have bony protrusions up to in length, but that is very rare, and they are not the same as spikes.

Antlers begin to grow in late spring, covered with a highly vascularised tissue known as velvet. Bucks either have a typical or atypical antler arrangement. Typical antlers are symmetrical and the points grow straight up off the main beam. Atypical antlers are asymmetrical and the points may project at any angle from the main beam. These descriptions are not the only limitations for typical and atypical antler arrangement. The Boone and Crockett or Pope and Young scoring systems also define relative degrees of typicality and atypicality by procedures to measure what proportion of the antlers is asymmetrical. Therefore, bucks with only slight asymmetry are scored as &quot;typical&quot;. A buck&#x27;s inside spread can be from . Bucks shed their antlers when all females have been bred, from late December to February.

==Ecology==
White-tailed deer are generalists and can adapt to a wide variety of habitats. The largest deer occur in the temperate regions of North America. The northern white-tailed deer (&quot;O. v. borealis&quot;), Dakota white-tailed deer (&quot;O. v. dacotensis&quot;), and northwest white-tailed deer (&quot;O. v. ochrourus&quot;) are some of the largest animals, with large antlers. The smallest deer occur in the Florida Keys and in partially wooded lowlands in the Neotropics.

Although most often thought of as forest animals depending on relatively small openings and edges, white-tailed deer can equally adapt themselves to life in more open prairie, savanna woodlands, and sage communities as in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These savanna-adapted deer have relatively large antlers in proportion to their body size and large tails. Also, a noticeable difference exists in size between male and female deer of the savannas. The Texas white-tailed deer (&quot;O. v. texanus&quot;), of the prairies and oak savannas of Texas and parts of Mexico, are the largest savanna-adapted deer in the Southwest, with impressive antlers that might rival deer found in Canada and the northern United States. Populations of Arizona (&quot;O. v. couesi&quot;) and Carmen Mountains (&quot;O. v. carminis&quot;) white-tailed deer inhabit montane mixed oak and pine woodland communities. The Arizona and Carmen Mountains deer are smaller, but may also have impressive antlers, considering their size. The white-tailed deer of the Llanos region of Colombia and Venezuela (&quot;O. v. apurensis&quot; and &quot;O. v. gymnotis&quot;) have antler dimensions similar to the Arizona white-tailed deer.

In some western regions of North America, the white-tailed deer range overlaps with those of the mule deer. White-tail incursions in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas have resulted in some hybrids. In the extreme north of the range, their habitat is also used by moose in some areas. White-tailed deer may occur in areas that are also exploited by elk (wapiti) such as in mixed deciduous river valley bottomlands and formerly in the mixed deciduous forest of eastern United States. In places such as Glacier National Park in Montana and several national parks in the Columbian Mountains (Mount Revelstoke National Park) and Canadian Rocky Mountains, as well as in the Yukon Territory (Yoho National Park and Kootenay National Park), white-tailed deer are shy and more reclusive than the coexisting mule deer, elk, and moose.

Central American white-tailed deer prefer tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, seasonal mixed deciduous forests, savanna, and adjacent wetland habitats over dense tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. South American subspecies of white-tailed deer live in two types of environments. The first type, similar to the Central American deer, consists of savannas, dry deciduous forests, and riparian corridors that cover much of Venezuela and eastern Colombia. The other type is the higher elevation mountain grassland/mixed forest ecozones in the Andes Mountains, from Venezuela to Peru. The Andean white-tailed deer seem to retain gray coats due to the colder weather at high altitudes, whereas the lowland savanna forms retain the reddish brown coats. South American white-tailed deer, like those in Central America, also generally avoid dense moist broadleaf forests.

Since the second half of the 19th century, white-tailed deer have been introduced to Europe. A population in the Brdy area remains stable today. In 1935, white-tailed deer were introduced to Finland. The introduction was successful, and the deer began spreading through northern Scandinavia and southern Karelia, competing with, and sometimes displacing, native species. The 2020 population of some 109,000 deer originated from four animals provided by Finnish Americans from Minnesota.

===Diet===
White-tailed deer eat large amounts of food, commonly eating legumes and foraging on other plants, including shoots, leaves, cacti (in deserts), prairie forbs, and grasses. They also eat acorns, fruit, and corn. Their multi-chambered stomachs allow them to eat some foods humans cannot, such as mushrooms (even those that are toxic to humans) and poison ivy. Their diets vary by season according to the availability of food sources. They also eat hay, grass, white clover, and other foods they can find in a farmyard. Though almost entirely herbivorous, white-tailed deer have been known to opportunistically feed on nesting songbirds, field mice, and birds trapped in mist nets, if the need arises. When additional amounts of minerals such as calcium are needed in their diet, they can resort to osteophagy, chewing on bones of dead animals. A grown deer can eat around of vegetable matter annually. A population of around can start to destroy the forest environment in their foraging area.

Their diet consists mostly of woody shoots, stems, and leaves of woody plants as well as grasses, cultivated crops, nuts, berries, and wildflowers. The items they feed on are not generally abundant in mature forests and are mostly found at &quot;edges&quot;. Edges are described as a &quot;mosaic of vegetation types that create numerous interwoven &#x27;edges&#x27; where their respective boundaries intersect&quot; and provide optimum cover for browsers such as the white-tailed deer. White-tailed deer can easily thrive in suburban areas, as a combination of increased safety from some predators (including human hunting), high quality and abundance of foods in home gardens, city parks, open farmland, and other factors all create landscapes with an abundance of edge habitat.

The white-tailed deer is a ruminant, which means it has a four-chambered stomach. Each chamber has a different and specific function that allows the deer to eat a variety of different foods, digesting it at a later time in a safe area of cover. The stomach hosts a complex set of microbes that change as the deer&#x27;s diet changes through the seasons. If the microbes necessary for digestion of a particular food (e.g., hay) are absent, it will not be digested. Utilizing foregut fermentation, the fermented ingesta (known as cud) is regurgitated and chewed again, to mix it with saliva and reduce the particle size. Smaller particle size allows for increased nutrient absorption and the saliva is important because it provides liquid for the microbial population, recirculates nitrogen and minerals, and acts as a buffer for the rumen pH.

===Predators===

There are several natural predators of white-tailed deer, with wolves, cougars, American alligators, jaguars (in the American southwest, Mexico, and Central and South America) and humans being the most effective natural predators. Aside from humans, these predators frequently pick out easily caught young or infirm deer (which is believed to improve the genetic stock of a population), but can and do take healthy adults of any size. Bobcats, Canada lynx, grizzly and American black bears, wolverines, and packs of coyotes usually prey mainly on fawns. Bears may sometimes attack adult deer, while lynxes, coyotes, and wolverines are most likely to take adult deer when the ungulates are weakened by harsh winter weather. Many scavengers rely on deer as carrion, including New World vultures, raptors, red and gray foxes, and corvids. Few wild predators can afford to be picky and any will readily consume deer as carrion. Records exist of American crows and common ravens attempting to prey on white-tailed deer fawns by pecking around their face and eyes, though no accounts of success are given. Occasionally, both golden and bald eagles may capture deer fawns with their talons. In one case, a golden eagle was filmed in Illinois unsuccessfully trying to prey on a large mature white-tailed deer.

White-tailed deer typically respond to the presence of potential predators by breathing very heavily (also called blowing) and fleeing. When they blow, the sound alerts other deer in the area. As they run, the flash of their white tails warns other deer. This especially serves to warn fawns when their mother is alarmed. Most natural predators of white-tailed deer hunt by ambush, although canids may engage in an extended chase, hoping to exhaust the prey. Felids typically try to suffocate the deer by biting the throat. Cougars and jaguars will initially knock the deer off balance with their powerful forelegs, whereas the smaller bobcats and lynxes will jump astride the deer to deliver a killing bite. In the case of canids and wolverines, the predators bite at the limbs and flanks, hobbling the deer, until they can reach vital organs and kill it through loss of blood. Bears, which usually target fawns, often simply knock down the prey and then start eating it while it is still alive. Alligators snatch deer as they try to drink from or cross bodies of water, grabbing them with their powerful jaws and dragging them into the water to drown.

Most primary natural predators of white-tailed deer have been essentially extirpated in eastern North America, with a very small number of reintroduced critically endangered red wolves, around North Carolina and a small remnant population of Florida panthers, a subspecies of the cougar. Gray wolves, the leading cause of deer mortality where they overlap, co-occur with whitetails in northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and most of Canada. This almost certainly plays a role in the overpopulation issues with this species. Coyotes, widespread and with a rapidly expanding population, are often the only major nonhuman predator of the species in the Eastern U.S., besides an occasional domestic dog. In some areas, American black bears are also significant predators. In north-central Pennsylvania, black bears were found to be nearly as common predators of fawns as coyotes. Bobcats, still fairly widespread, usually only exploit deer as prey when smaller prey is scarce. Discussions have occurred regarding the possible reintroduction of gray wolves and cougars to sections of the eastern United States, largely because of the apparent controlling effect they have through deer predation on local ecosystems, as has been illustrated in the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park and their controlling effect on previously overpopulated elk. However, due to the heavy urban development in much of the Eastern U.S., and fear for livestock and human lives, such ideas have ultimately been rejected by local communities and/or by government services and have not been carried through.

In areas where they are heavily hunted by humans, deer run almost immediately from people and are quite wary even where not heavily hunted.
White-tailed deer can run faster than their predators and have been recorded sprinting at speeds of per hour and sustaining speeds of per hour over distances of ; this ranks them amongst the fastest of all deer, alongside the Eurasian roe deer. They can also jump high and up to forward. When shot at, a white-tailed deer will run at high speeds with its tail down. If frightened, the deer will hop in a zig-zag with its tail straight up. If the deer feels extremely threatened, however, it may choose to attack, charging the person or predator posing the threat, using its antlers or, if none are present, its head to fight off its target.

===Forest alteration===
In certain parts of eastern North America, high deer densities have caused large reductions in plant biomass, including the density and heights of certain forest wildflowers, tree seedlings, and shrubs. Although they can be seen as a nuisance species, white-tailed deer also play an important role in biodiversity. At the same time, increases in browse-tolerant grasses and sedges and unpalatable ferns have often accompanied intensive deer herbivory. Changes to the structure of forest understories have, in turn, altered the composition and abundance of forest bird communities in some areas. In regions of intermediate density, deer activity has also been shown to increase herbaceous plant diversity, particularly in disturbed areas, by reducing competitively dominant plants; and to increase the growth rates of important canopy trees, perhaps by increased nutrient inputs into the soil.

In northeastern hardwood forests, high-density deer populations affect plant succession, particularly following clear-cuts and patch cuts. In succession without deer, annual herbs and woody plants are followed by commercially valuable, shade-tolerant oak and maple. The shade-tolerant trees prevent the invasion of less commercial cherry and American beech, which are stronger nutrient competitors, but not as shade tolerant. Although deer eat shade-tolerant plants and acorns, this is not the only way deer can shift the balance in favor of nutrient competitors. Deer consuming earlier-succession plants allows in enough light for nutrient competitors to invade. Since slow-growing oaks need several decades to develop root systems sufficient to compete with faster-growing species, removal of the canopy prior to that point amplifies the effect of deer on succession. High-density deer populations possibly could browse eastern hemlock seedlings out of existence in northern hardwood forests; however, this scenario seems unlikely, given that deer browsing is not considered the critical factor preventing hemlock re-establishment at large scales.

Ecologists have also expressed concern over the facilitative effect high deer populations have on invasions of exotic plant species. In a study of eastern hemlock forests, browsing by white-tailed deer caused populations of three exotic plants to rise faster than they do in the areas which are absent of deer. Seedlings of the three invading species rose exponentially with deer density, while the most common native species fell exponentially with deer density, because deer were preferentially eating the native species. The effects of deer on the invasive and native plants were magnified in cases of canopy disturbance.

===Population and controls===
The white-tailed deer population in North America has declined by several million since 2000, but as of 2017 is considered healthy and is approximately equal to the historical pre-colonization white-tailed population on the continent. The species has rebounded considerably after being overhunted nearly to extinction in the late 1800s and very early 1900s. By contrast, the species&#x27; closest cousins (blacktail deer and mule deer) have seen their populations cut by more than half in North America after peaking in 1960 and have never regained their pre-colonization numbers. In the 21st century, the loss of natural predators has been more than offset by the ongoing loss of natural habitat to human development, and changes to logging operations.

Several methods have been developed to curb the population of white-tailed deer in suburban areas where they are perceived as overabundant, and these can be separated into lethal and nonlethal strategies. Most common in the U.S. is the use of extended hunting as population control, as well as a way to provide meat for humans. In Maryland and many other states, a state agency sets regulations on bag limits and hunting in the area depending on the deer population levels assessed. Hunting seasons may fluctuate in duration, or restrictions may be set to affect how many deer or what type of deer can be hunted in certain regions. For the 2015–2016 white-tailed deer-hunting season, some areas allowed only the hunting of antlerless white-tailed deer. These included young bucks and females, which encouraged the culling of does, aiding in population control.

A more targeted yet more expensive removal strategy than public hunting is a method referred to as sharpshooting. Sharpshooting can be an option when the area inhabited by the deer is unfit for public hunting. This strategy may work in areas close to human populations, since it is done by professional marksmen, and requires a submitted plan of action to the city with details of the time and location of the action, as well as number of deer to be culled. Another controversial method involves trapping the deer in a net or other trap, and then administering a chemical euthanizing agent or extermination by firearm. A main issue in questioning the humaneness of this method is the stress that the deer endure while trapped and awaiting extermination.

Nonlethal methods include contraceptive injections, sterilization, and translocation of deer. While lethal methods have municipal support as being the most effective in the short term, some opponents of this view suggest that extermination has no significant impact on deer populations. Opponents of contraceptive methods point out that fertility control cannot provide meat and proves ineffective over time as populations in open-field systems move about. Concerns are voiced that the contraceptives have not been adequately researched for the effect they could have on humans. Fertility control also does nothing to affect the current population and the effects their grazing may be having on the forest plant make-up.

Translocation has been considered overly costly for the little benefit it provides. Deer experience high stress and are at high risk of dying in the process, putting into question its humaneness. Another concern regarding translocation is the possible spreading of chronic wasting disease to unaffected deer populations and concerns about exposure to human populations.

In addition to the danger of deer-vehicle collisions the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reported that the estimated loss in field crops, nuts, fruits, and vegetables in 2001 was near $765 million, (equivalent to $ in ).

==Behavior==

Males compete for the opportunity of breeding females. Sparring among males determines a dominance hierarchy. Bucks attempt to copulate with as many females as possible, losing physical condition, since they rarely eat or rest during the rut. The general geographical trend is for the rut to be shorter in duration at increased latitude. Many factors determine how intense the &quot;rutting season&quot; will be; air temperature is a major one. Any time the temperature rises above , the males do much less traveling looking for females, else they will be subject to overheating or dehydrating. Another factor for the strength of rutting activity is competition. If numerous males are in a particular area, then they compete more with the females. If fewer males or more females are present, then the selection process will not need to be as competitive.

===Reproduction===
Females enter estrus, colloquially called the rut, in the autumn, normally in late October or early November, triggered mainly by the declining photoperiod. Sexual maturation of females depends on population density, as well as the availability of food. Young females often flee from an area heavily populated with males. Some does may be as young as six months when they reach sexual maturity, but the average age of maturity is 18 months. Copulation consists of a brief copulatory jump.
Females give birth to one to three spotted young, known as fawns, in mid-to-late spring, generally in May or June. Fawns lose their spots during the first summer and weigh from by the first winter. Male fawns tend to be slightly larger and heavier than females. For the first four weeks, fawns are hidden in vegetation by their mothers, who nurse them four to five times a day. This strategy keeps scent levels low to avoid predators. After about a month, the fawns are then able to follow their mothers on foraging trips. They are usually weaned after 8–10 weeks, but cases have been seen where mothers have continued to allow nursing long after the fawns have lost their spots (for several months, or until the end of fall) as seen by rehabilitators and other studies. Males leave their mothers after a year and females leave after two.

Bucks are generally sexually mature at 1.5 years old and begin to breed even in populations stacked with older bucks.

===Communication===

White-tailed deer have many forms of communication involving sounds, scent, body language, and marking. In addition to the blowing as mentioned above in the presence of danger, all white-tailed deer can produce audible noises unique to each animal. Fawns release a high-pitched squeal, known as a bleat, to call out to their mothers. This bleat deepens as the fawn grows until it becomes the grunt of the mature deer, a guttural sound that attracts the attention of any other deer in the area. A doe makes maternal grunts when searching for her bedded fawns. Bucks also grunt, at a pitch lower than that of the doe; this grunt deepens as the buck matures. In addition to grunting, both does and bucks also snort, a sound that often signals an imminent threat. Mature bucks also produce a grunt-snort-wheeze pattern, unique to each animal, that asserts its dominance, aggression, and hostility. White-tailed deer also use &quot;tail-flagging,&quot; a behavior where the tail is raised when they detect a threat. However, the function of this behavior is disputed, and it appears to be a signal to predators more than an intraspecific communication warning other deer.

===Marking===
White-tailed deer possess many glands that allow them to produce scents, some of which are so potent they can be detected by the human nose. Four major glands are the preorbital, forehead, tarsal, and metatarsal glands. Secretions from the preorbital glands (in front of the eye) were thought to be rubbed on tree branches, but research suggests this is not so. Scent from the forehead or sudoriferous glands (found on the head, between the antlers and eyes) is used to deposit scent on branches that overhang scrapes (areas scraped by the deer&#x27;s front hooves before rub-urination). The tarsal glands are found on the upper inside of the hock (middle joint) on each hind leg. The scent is deposited from these glands when deer walk through and rub against vegetation. These scrapes are used by bucks as a sort of &quot;sign-post&quot; by which bucks know which other bucks are in the area, and to let does know a buck is regularly passing through the area—for breeding purposes. The scent from the metatarsal glands, found on the outside of each hind leg, between the ankle and hooves, may be used as an alarm scent. The scent from the interdigital glands, which are located between the hooves of each foot, emit a yellow waxy substance with an offensive odor. Deer can be seen stomping their hooves if they sense danger through sight, sound, or smell; this action leaves an excessive amount of odor for warning other deer of possible danger.


Throughout the year, deer rub-urinate, a process during which a deer squats while urinating so the urine will run down the insides of the deer&#x27;s legs, over the tarsal glands, and onto the hair covering these glands. Bucks rub-urinate more frequently during the breeding season. Secretions from the preputial glands and tarsal glands mix with the urine and bacteria to produce a strong-smelling odor. During the breeding season, does release hormones and pheromones that tell bucks a doe is in heat and able to breed. Bucks also rub trees and shrubs with their antlers and heads during the breeding season, possibly transferring scent from the forehead glands to the tree, leaving a scent other deer can detect.

Sign-post marking (scrapes and rubs) is a very obvious way white-tailed deer communicate. Although bucks do most of the marking, does visit these locations often. To make a rub, a buck uses his antlers to strip the bark off small-diameter trees, helping to mark his territory and polish his antlers. To mark areas they regularly pass through, bucks make scrapes. Often occurring in patterns known as scrape lines, scrapes are areas where a buck has used his front hooves to expose bare earth. They often rub-urinate into these scrapes, which are often found under twigs that have been marked with scent from the forehead glands.

== Hunting ==
White-tailed deer have long been hunted as game, for pure sport and for their commodities, and is probably the most hunted native big game species in the Americas. In Mesoamerica, white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) were hunted from very early times. Rites and rituals in preparation for deer hunting and celebration for an auspicious hunt are still practiced in the area today. Ancient hunters ask their gods for permission to hunt, and some deer rites take place in caves.

Venison, or deer meat, is a nutritious form of lean animal protein. In some areas where their populations are very high, white-tailed deer are considered a pest, and hunting is used as a method to control them.

In 1884, one of the first hunts of white-tailed deer in Europe was conducted in Opočno and Dobříš (Brdy Mountains area), in what is now the Czech Republic. In the same era, white-tailed deer were hunted to near extinction in North America, but numbers have since rebounded to approximate pre-colonization levels. In the United States, whitetail hunting is far more popular in some states than others. The top five states for whitetail hunter concentrations are all in the Northeast and Midwest (Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New York, Wisconsin, and Ohio). The Northeast in particular has twice the hunter density of the Midwest and Southeast and ten times that of the West.

Since whitetail deer are very adaptable, inhabiting diverse regions ranging from tropical rain forests to high-altitude mountain chains of the Andes Mountains at more than 13,000 feet, different hunting methods as well as types of guns and ammo may be used. Most common cartridges used include the .243 Winchester, .308 Winchester, .25-06 Remington, 6.5mm Creedmoor, .270 Winchester, 7mm Remington Magnum, .30-06 Springfield, .30-30 Winchester (.30 WCF), .300 Winchester Magnum and 12 gauge shotshells. Due to the whitetail deer&#x27;s frame and weight, cup and core bullets are the most recommended for taking clean, ethical shots.

Sport hunting for whitetail deer is a way of conservation of natural habitats as well as a population management.

==Human interactions==
By the early 20th century, commercial exploitation and unregulated hunting had severely depressed deer populations in much of their range. For example, by about 1930, the U.S. population was thought to number about 300,000. After an outcry by hunters and conservation ecologists, commercial exploitation of deer became illegal and conservation programs along with regulated hunting were introduced. In 2005, estimates put the deer population in the United States at around 30 million. Conservation practices have proved so successful, in parts of their range, the white-tailed deer populations currently far exceed their cultural carrying capacity and the animal may be considered a nuisance. A reduction in non-human predators (which normally cull young, sick, or infirm specimens) has also contributed to locally abundant populations.

At high population densities, farmers can suffer economic damage from deer feeding on cash crops, especially in corn and orchards. It has become nearly impossible to grow some crops in some areas unless very burdensome deer-deterring measures are taken. Deer can easily jump fences, and their fear of motion and sounds meant to scare them away is soon dulled. Timber harvesting and forest clearance have historically resulted in increased deer population densities, which in turn have slowed the rate of reforestation following logging in some areas. High densities of deer can have severe impacts on native plants and animals in parks and natural areas; however, deer browsing can also promote plant and animal diversity in some areas. Deer can also cause substantial damage to landscape plants in suburban areas, leading to limited hunting or trapping to relocate or sterilize them. In parts of the Eastern US with high deer populations and fragmented woodlands, deer often wander into suburban and urban habitats that are less than ideal for the species.

===Farming===

In New Zealand, the United States, and Canada, white-tailed deer are kept as livestock, and are extensively as well as intensively farmed for their meat, antlers, and pelts. The industry for farming white-tailed deer has grown significantly in the past two decades. In recent years, sales of white-tailed deer have generated up to $44 million in revenue. They are a good business venture because they have a high fertility rate and long reproductive life, can tolerate all weather, can be raised on land that is not suitable for agriculture and offer many by-products that can be sold. The North American white-tailed deer industry is split between breeding farms and hunting ranches. While some people care about the by-products produced by the deer, some people just care for the pursuit of a hunt. In the United States alone, around 13–14 million hunting licenses are sold every year. This could be a very profitable industry, especially considering the invasiveness of this species and the rate they have shown they are able to reproduce. However, this industry could have great repercussions on the ecosystem the farms are placed in because overpopulation of deer causes damage to local fauna.

===Deer–vehicle collisions===

Motor vehicle collisions with deer are a significant issue in many parts of their range, especially at night and during rutting season, causing injuries and fatalities among both deer and humans. Vehicular damage can be substantial in some cases. In the United States, such collisions increased from 200,000 in 1980 to 500,000 in 1991. By 2009, the insurance industry estimated 2.4 million deer–vehicle collisions had occurred over the past two years, estimating damage cost to be over 7 billion dollars and 300 human deaths. Despite the high rate of these accidents, the effect on deer density is still quite low. Vehicle collisions of deer were monitored for two years in Virginia, and the collective annual mortality did not surpass 20% of the estimated deer population.

Many techniques have been investigated to prevent roadside mortality. Fences or road under- or over- passes have been shown to decrease deer-vehicle collisions, but are expensive and difficult to implement on a large scale. Roadside habitat modifications could also successfully decrease the number of collisions along roadways. An essential procedure in understanding factors resulting in accidents is to quantify risks, which involves the driver&#x27;s behavior in terms of safe speed and ability to observe the deer. Some have suggested that reducing speed limits during the winter months when deer density is exceptionally high would likely reduce deer-vehicle collisions, but this may be an impractical solution.

===Diseases===
Another issue that exists with high deer density is the spreading of infectious diseases. Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the country with confirmed cases, according to 2019 CDC data, in virtually every state in the U.S. with the highest incidence levels in the states from Maine to Virginia, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In 2019 the number of confirmed and probable cases totaled about 35,000. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
Newer evidence suggests the white-footed mouse is the most significant vector.

====SARS-CoV-2====

Blood samples gathered by USDA researchers in 2021 also showed that 40% of sampled white-tailed deer demonstrated evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with the highest percentages in Michigan, at 67%, and Pennsylvania, at 44%. A later study by Penn State University and wildlife officials in Iowa showed that up to 80 percent of Iowa deer sampled from April 2020 through January 2021 had tested positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection, rather than solely antibodies from prior infection. This data, confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, alerted scientists to the possibility that white-tailed deer had become a natural reservoir for the coronavirus, serving as a potential &quot;variant factory&quot; for eventual retransmission back into humans. An Ohio State University study further showed that humans had transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to white-tailed deer on at least six separate occasions and that deer possessed six mutations that were uncommon in humans at the time of the study. Infected deer can shed virus via nasal secretions and feces for five to six days and frequently engage in activities conductive to viral spread, such as sniffing food intermingled with waste, nuzzling noses, polygamy, and the sharing of salt licks. Canadian researchers uncovered an entirely new SARS-CoV-2 variant within a November–December 2021 study of Ontario white-tailed deer. The new COVID variant had also infected a person who had close contact with local deer, potentially marking the first instance of deer-to-human transmission.

===Cultural significance===

In the U.S., the species is the state animal of Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina, the game animal of Oklahoma, and the wildlife symbol of Wisconsin. The white-tailed deer is also the inspiration of the professional basketball team the Milwaukee Bucks. The profile of a white-tailed deer buck caps the coat of arms of Vermont, is on the flag of Vermont, and is in stained glass at the Vermont State House. It is the national animal of Honduras and Costa Rica and the provincial animal of Canadian Saskatchewan and Finnish Pirkanmaa. It appears on the reverse side of the Costa Rican 1,000 colón note. The 1942 Disney film adaptation of &quot;Bambi&quot;, famously changed Bambi&#x27;s species from the novel&#x27;s roe deer into a white-tailed deer.

== Climate change ==

=== Migration patterns ===
Climate change is affecting the white-tailed deer by changing their migration patterns and increasing their population size. This species of deer is restricted from moving northward due to cold harsh winters. Consequently, as climate change warms up Earth, these deer are allowed to migrate further north which will result in the populations of the white-tailed deer increasing. Between 1980 and 2000 in a study by Dawe and Boutin, presence of white-tailed deer in Alberta, Canada was driven primarily by changes in the climate. Populations of white-tailed deer have also moved anywhere from 50 to 250 km north of the eastern Alberta study site. Another study by Kennedy-Slaney, Bowman, Walpole, and Pond found that if current CO2 emissions remained the same, global warming resulting from the increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will allow white-tailed deer to survive further and further north by 2100.

=== Food web ===
When species are introduced to foreign ecosystems, they could potentially wreak havoc on the existing food web. For example, when the deer moved north in Alberta, gray wolf populations increased. This butterfly effect was also demonstrated in Yellowstone National Park when the rivers changed because wolves were re-introduced to the ecosystem. It is also possible that the increasing white-tailed deer populations could result in them becoming an invasive species for various plants in Alberta, Canada.

=== Disease ===
The species is vulnerable to diseases that are more prevalent in the summer. Insects carrying these diseases are usually killed during the first snowfall. However, as time goes on, they will be able to live longer than they used to meaning the deer are at higher risk of getting sick. It is possible that this will increase the deers&#x27; mortality rate from disease. Examples of these diseases are hemorrhagic disease (HD), epizootic hemorrhagic disease and bluetongue viruses, which are transmitted by biting midges. The hotter summers, longer droughts, and more intense rains create the perfect environment for the midges to thrive in. Ticks also thrive in warmer weather heat results in faster development in all of their life stages. 18 different species of tick infest white-tailed deer in the United States alone. Ticks are parasitic to white-tailed deer transmit diseases causing irritation, anemia, and infections.

<text>In computer programming, program slicing is the computation of the set of program statements, the program slice, that may affect the values at some point of interest, referred to as a slicing criterion. Program slicing can be used in debugging to locate source of errors more easily. Other applications of slicing include software maintenance, optimization, program analysis, and information flow control.

Slicing techniques have been seeing a rapid development since the original definition by Mark Weiser. At first, slicing was only static, i.e., applied on the source code with no other information than the source code. Bogdan Korel and Janusz Laski introduced &quot;dynamic slicing&quot;, which works on a specific execution of the program (for a given execution trace). Other forms of slicing exist, for instance path slicing.

== Static slicing ==

Based on the original definition of Weiser, informally, a static program slice S consists of all statements in program P that may affect the value of variable v in a statement x. The slice is defined for a slicing criterion C=(x,v) where x is a statement in program P and v is variable in x. A static slice includes all the statements that can affect the value of variable v at statement x for any possible input. Static slices are computed by backtracking dependencies between statements. More specifically, to compute the static slice for (x,v), we first find all statements that can directly affect the value of v before statement x is encountered. Recursively, for each statement y which can affect the value of v in statement x, we compute the slices for all variables z in y that affect the value of v. The union of all those slices is the static slice for (x,v).

=== Example ===

For example, consider the C program below. Let&#x27;s compute the slice for ( write(sum), sum ). The value of sum is directly affected by the statements &quot;sum = sum + i + w&quot; if N&gt;1 and &quot;int sum = 0&quot; if N &lt;= 1. So, slice( write(sum), sum) is the union of three slices and the &quot;int sum = 0&quot; statement which has no dependencies:
It is fairly easy to see that slice( sum = sum + i + w, sum) consists of &quot;sum = sum + i + w&quot; and &quot;int sum = 0&quot; because those are the only two prior statements that can affect the value of sum at &quot;sum = sum + i + w&quot;. Similarly, slice( sum = sum + i + w, i) only contains &quot;for(i = 1; i &lt; N; ++i) {&quot; and slice( sum = sum + i + w, w) only contains the statement &quot;int w = 7&quot;. 

When we union all of those statements, we do not have executable code, so to make the slice an executable slice we merely add the end brace for the for loop and the declaration of i. The resulting static executable slice is shown below the original code below.
int i;
int sum = 0;
int product = 1;
int w = 7;
for(i = 1; i &lt; N; ++i) {
 sum = sum + i + w;
 product = product * i;
write(sum);
write(product);

The static executable slice for criteria (codice_1, sum) is the new program shown below.

int i;
int sum = 0;
int w = 7;
for(i = 1; i &lt; N; ++i) {
 sum = sum + i + w;
write(sum);
In fact, most static slicing techniques, including Weiser&#x27;s own technique, will also remove the codice_1 statement. Since, at the statement codice_1, the value of codice_4 is not dependent on the statement itself. Often a slice for a particular statement x will include more than one variable. If V is a set of variables in a statement x, then the slice for (x, V) is the union of all slices with criteria (x, v) where v is a variable in the set V.

== Lightweight forward static slicing approach ==
A very fast and scalable, yet slightly less accurate, slicing approach is extremely useful for a number of reasons. Developers will have a very low cost and practical means to estimate the impact of a change within minutes versus days. This is very important for planning the implementation of new features and understanding how a change is related to other parts of the system. It will also provide an inexpensive test to determine if a full, more expensive, analysis of the system is warranted. A fast slicing approach will open up new avenues of research in metrics and the mining of histories based on slicing. That is, slicing can now be conducted on very large systems and on entire version histories in very practical time frames. This opens the door to a number of experiments and empirical investigations previously too costly to undertake.

== Dynamic slicing ==
Dynamic slicing makes use of information about a particular execution of a program. A dynamic slice contains all statements that actually affect the value of a variable at a program point for a particular execution of the program rather than all statements that may have affected the value of a variable at a program point for any arbitrary execution of the program.

An example to clarify the difference between static and dynamic slicing. Consider a small piece of a program unit, in which there is an iteration block containing an if-else block. There are a few statements in both the codice_5 and codice_6 blocks that have an effect on a variable. In the case of static slicing, since the whole program unit is looked at irrespective of a particular execution of the program, the affected statements in both blocks would be included in the slice. But, in the case of dynamic slicing we consider a particular execution of the program, wherein the codice_5 block gets executed and the affected statements in the codice_6 block do not get executed. So, that is why in this particular execution case, the dynamic slice would contain only the statements in the codice_5 block.
