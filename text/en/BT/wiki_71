<doc id="577952" wikidata="Q3246291" url="?curid=577952" title="List of college athletic conferences in the United States">
<text>In college athletics in the United States, institutions typically join in conferences for regular play under different governing bodies.

There are several national and regional associations governing the varsity teams of colleges and universities. Varsity teams are typically funded by an institution&#x27;s athletic department, and under some governing bodies players are eligible for athletic scholarships.

<text>Katie Roiphe (born July 13, 1968) is an American author and journalist. She is best known as the author of the non-fiction book &quot;The Morning After: Sex, Fear, and Feminism on Campus&quot; (1993). She is also the author of &quot;Last Night in Paradise: Sex and Morals at the Century&#x27;s End&quot; (1997), and the 2007 study of writers and marriage, &quot;Uncommon Arrangements&quot;. Her 2001 novel &quot;Still She Haunts Me&quot; is an imagining of the relationship between Charles Dodgson (known as Lewis Carroll) and Alice Liddell, the real-life model for Dodgson&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. She is also known for allegedly planning to name the creator of the Shitty Media Men list in an article for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==Background and education==
Roiphe grew up in New York City, daughter of psychoanalyst Herman Roiphe and noted feminist Anne (née Roth) Roiphe. She attended the all-female Brearley School, received an AB from Harvard University/Radcliffe College in 1990, and received a PhD in English Literature from Princeton University in 1995.

In 2001, Roiphe married attorney Harry Chernoff in a Jewish ceremony in Amagansett, New York. They had one daughter, Violet; they separated in 2005 (the year Roiphe&#x27;s father died), and later divorced.

She subsequently had a son, and has defended being a single mother.

==&quot;The Morning After&quot;==

In her first book, &quot;The Morning After&quot;, Roiphe argues that in many instances of supposed campus date rape, women are responsible for their actions. &quot;One of the questions used to define rape was: &#x27;Have you had sexual intercourse when you didn&#x27;t want to because a man gave you alcohol or drugs?&#x27; The phrasing raises the issue of agency. Why aren&#x27;t college women responsible for their own intake of alcohol or drugs? A man may give her drugs, but she herself decides to take them. If we assume that women are not all helpless and naive, then they should be responsible for their choice to drink or take drugs. If a woman&#x27;s &#x27;judgment is impaired&#x27; and she has sex, it isn&#x27;t always the man&#x27;s fault; it isn&#x27;t necessarily always rape.&quot;

In the review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt praised the book, calling it a &quot;Book of the Times&quot; and stating, &quot;It is courageous of Ms. Roiphe to speak out against the herd ideas that campus life typically encourages.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Katha Pollitt gave the book a negative review, calling it &quot;a careless and irresponsible performance, poorly argued and full of misrepresentations, slapdash research, and gossip.&quot; Pollitt&#x27;s review was in turn criticized by Christina Hoff Sommers in &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot; (1994). &quot;The Morning After&quot; received a positive response from Camille Paglia, who called it &quot;an eloquent, thoughtful, finely argued book that was savaged from coast to coast by shallow, dishonest feminist book reviewers&quot;.

==Cultural criticism==
Roiphe&#x27;s second book was 1997&#x27;s &quot;Last Night in Paradise: Sex and Morals at the Century&#x27;s End&quot;. She also began to contribute reviews and essays to &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2008, she published an essay featured in the anthology &quot;Thirty Ways of Looking at Hillary: Reflections by Women Writers.&quot; In her essay, entitled &quot;Elect Sister Frigidaire&quot;, Roiphe writes that Hillary Clinton is &quot;in many ways the feminist dream incarnate, the opportunity made flesh, the words we whisper to little girls: &#x27;You can be president. You can do anything you want.&#x27;&quot; Reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Michiko Kakutani noted that some of Roiphe&#x27;s observations were in &quot;stark contrast&quot; to what Kakutani considered some of the &quot;antifeminist&quot; pieces in the collection. She has also written a novel based on the life of Lewis Carroll and his relationship with the real Alice, called &quot;Still She Haunts Me&quot;, which was published in 2001.

In 2007, Roiphe published &quot;Uncommon Arrangements: Seven Portraits of Married Life in London Literary Circles 1910-1939&quot;. Donna Seaman, in the trade publication &quot;Booklist&quot;, gave the book a starred review, writing, &quot;Roiphe, inspired aesthetically and philosophically by the writings and lives of these social and artistic pioneers, offers sophisticated psychological, sexual, and social analysis, fashioning uncommonly affecting portraits of uncommon men and women.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the editor and critic Tina Brown called it &quot;the perfect bedside book for an age like our own, when everything is known and nothing is understood.&quot; In &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Alexandra Jacobs conceded &quot;Katie haters will be sorry to hear that it’s very absorbing. The author has done something constructive, for a change, with her contempt for the contemporary age’s lily-livered female psyche...&quot; Roiphe responded to some of her critics in an essay in &quot;Slate&quot; including &quot;Gawker&quot;.

In 2012, Roiphe published the essay collection &quot;In Praise of Messy Lives&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Dwight Garner praised the book, writing, &quot;I’ve begun recommending it to people, particularly to would-be writers, explaining that Ms. Roiphe’s are how you want your essays to sound: lean and literate, not unlike Orwell’s, with a frightening ratio of velocity to torque... Among Ms. Roiphe’s gifts is one for brevity. She lingers long enough to make her points, and no longer. If I could condense my opinion of her new book onto a T-shirt, that Beefy-T would read: &#x27;Team Roiphe.&#x27;&quot;

==Controversy==
In January 2018, Twitter users spread the information that Roiphe planned to name the creator of the anonymous Shitty Media Men list, a private spreadsheet that later became public. The creator, Moira Donegan, outed herself preemptively in an essay for &quot;The Cut&quot; magazine.

==Academic work==
Roiphe is a professor at New York University&#x27;s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute and the Director of the Cultural Reporting and Criticism Program.

<doc id="577962" wikidata="Q903509" url="?curid=577962" title="Half-cell">
<text>In electrochemistry, a half-cell is a structure that contains a conductive electrode and a surrounding conductive electrolyte separated by a naturally occurring Helmholtz double layer. Chemical reactions within this layer momentarily pump electric charges between the electrode and the electrolyte, resulting in a potential difference between the electrode and the electrolyte. The typical anode reaction involves a metal atom in the electrode being dissolved and transported as a positive ion across the double layer, causing the electrolyte to acquire a net positive charge while the electrode acquires a net negative charge. The growing potential difference creates an intense electric field within the double layer, and the potential rises in value until the field halts the net charge-pumping reactions. This self-limiting action occurs almost instantly in an isolated half-cell; in applications two dissimilar half-cells are appropriately connected to constitute a Galvanic cell.

A standard half-cell consists of a metal electrode in an aqueous solution where the concentration of the metal ions is 1 molar (1 mol/L) at 298 kelvins (25 °C). In the case of the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), a platinum electrode is used and is immersed in an acidic solution where the concentration of hydrogen ions is 1M, with hydrogen gas at 1atm being bubbled through solution. The electrochemical series, which consists of standard electrode potentials and is closely related to the reactivity series, was generated by measuring the difference in potential between the metal half-cell in a circuit with a standard hydrogen half-cell, connected by a salt bridge.

The standard hydrogen half-cell:
:2H+(aq) + 2e− → H2(g)

The half-cells of a Daniell cell:
:Original equation
::Zn + Cu2+ → Zn2+ + Cu
:Half-cell (anode) of Zn
::Zn → Zn2+ + 2e−
:Half-cell (cathode) of Cu
::Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu

<doc id="577965" wikidata="Q1967499" url="?curid=577965" title="Women's Social and Political Union">
<text>The Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) was a women-only political movement and leading militant organisation campaigning for women&#x27;s suffrage in the United Kingdom founded in 1903. Known from 1906 as the suffragettes, its membership and policies were tightly controlled by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia. Sylvia was eventually expelled.

The WSPU membership became known for civil disobedience and direct action. Emmeline Pankhurst described them as engaging in a &quot;reign of terror&quot;. Group members heckled politicians, held demonstrations and marches, broke the law to force arrests, broke windows in prominent buildings, set fire to or introduced chemicals into postboxes thus injuring several postal workers, and committed a series of arsons that killed at least five people and injured at least 24. When imprisoned, the group&#x27;s members engaged in hunger strikes and were subject to force-feeding. Emmeline Pankhurst said the group&#x27;s goal was &quot;to make England and every department of English life insecure and unsafe&quot;.

==Early years==
The Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) was founded as an independent women&#x27;s movement on 10 October 1903 at 62 Nelson Street, Manchester, home of the Pankhurst family. Emmeline Pankhurst, along with two of her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia, and her husband, Richard, before his death in 1898, had been active in the Independent Labour Party (ILP), founded in 1893 by Scottish former miner Keir Hardie, a family friend. (Hardie later founded the Labour Party.)

Emmeline Pankhurst had increasingly felt that the ILP was not there for women. On 9 October 1903, she invited a group of ILP women to meet at her home the next day, telling them: &quot;Women, we must do the work ourselves. We must have an independent women&#x27;s movement. Come to my house tomorrow and we will arrange it!&quot; 

Membership of the WSPU was open to women only – men could not become members. It also had no party affiliation.

In 1905, the group convinced the Liberal MP Bamford Slack to introduce a women&#x27;s suffrage bill; it was ultimately talked out, but the publicity spurred rapid expansion of the group. The WSPU changed tactics following the failure of the bill; they focused on attacking whichever political party was in government and refused to support any legislation which did not include enfranchisement of women. This translated into abandoning their initial commitment to also supporting immediate social reforms.

The term &quot;suffragette&quot; was first used in 1906 as a term of derision by the journalist Charles E. Hands in the London &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to describe activists in the movement for women&#x27;s suffrage, in particular members of the WSPU. But the women he intended to ridicule embraced the term, saying &quot;suffraGETtes&quot; (hardening the &#x27;g&#x27;), implying not only that they wanted the vote, but that they intended to &#x27;get&#x27; it.

Also in 1906, the group began a series of demonstrations and lobbies of Parliament, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of growing numbers of their members. An attempt to achieve equal franchise gained national attention when an envoy of 300 women, representing over 125,000 suffragettes, argued for women&#x27;s suffrage with the Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. The Prime Minister agreed with their argument but &quot;was obliged to do nothing at all about it&quot; and so urged the women to &quot;go on pestering&quot; and to exercise &quot;the virtue of patience&quot;.

Some of the women Campbell-Bannerman advised to be patient had been working for women&#x27;s rights for as many as fifty years: his advice to &quot;go on pestering&quot; would prove quite unwise. His thoughtless words infuriated the protesters and &quot;by those foolish words the militant movement became irrevocably established, and the stage of revolt began&quot;. In 1907, the organisation held the first of several of their &quot;Women&#x27;s Parliaments&quot;.

The Labour Party then voted to support universal suffrage. This split them from the WSPU, which had always accepted the property qualifications which already applied to women&#x27;s participation in local elections. Under Christabel&#x27;s direction, the group began to more explicitly organise exclusively among middle-class women, and stated their opposition to all political parties. This led a small group of prominent members to leave and form the Women&#x27;s Freedom League.

==Campaigning develops==

Immediately following the WSPU/WFL split, in autumn 1907, Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence founded the WSPU&#x27;s own newspaper, &quot;Votes for Women&quot;. The Pethick-Lawrences, who were part of the leadership of the WSPU until 1912, edited the newspaper and supported it financially in the early years. Sylvia Pankhurst wrote a number of articles for the WSPU newspaper and, in 1911, published a piece on the history of the WSPU campaign. This included a detailed account of her experience during the Black Friday event in 1910. 

In 1908 the WSPU adopted purple, white, and green as its official colours. These colours were chosen by Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence because &quot;Purple...stands for the royal blood that flows in the veins of every suffragette...white stands for purity in private and public life...green is the colour of hope and the emblem of spring&quot;. June 1908 saw the first major public use of these colours when the WSPU held a 300,000-strong &quot;Women&#x27;s Sunday&quot; rally in Hyde Park. Sylvia Pankhurst designed the logo and created a number of leaflets, banners, and posters.

In February 1907, the WSPU founded the Woman&#x27;s Press, which oversaw publishing and propaganda for the organisation, and marketed a range of products from 1908 featuring the WSPU&#x27;s name or colours. The woman&#x27;s Press in London and WSPU chains throughout the UK operated stores selling WSPU products. A board game named Suffragetto was published circa 1908. Until January 1911, the WSPU&#x27;s official anthem was &quot;The Women&#x27;s Marseillaise&quot;, a setting of words by Florence Macaulay to the tune of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. In that month the anthem was changed to &quot;The March of the Women&quot;, newly composed by Ethel Smyth with words by Cicely Hamilton.

On 13 October 1908, Emmeline Pankhurst together with Christabel Pankhurst and Flora Drummond organised a rush on the House of Commons. 60,000 people gathered in Parliament Square and attempts were made by suffragettes to break through the 5000 strong police cordon. Thirty-seven arrests were made, ten people were taken to hospital. On 29 June 1909, WSPU activists Ada Wright and Sarah Carwin were arrested for breaking government windows. They were sentenced to a month in prison. After breaking every window in their cells, in a protest they went on a hunger strike, following the pioneering strike of Marion Wallace Dunlop. They were released after six days.

==Direct action==
In 1910 Conciliation Bill, giving a limited number of propertied and married women the vote was carried on its first reading in the House of Commons, but then shelved by Prime Minister Asquith. In protest, on 18 November Emmeline Pankhurst led 300 women from a pre-arranged meeting at the Caxton Hall in a march on Parliament where they were met and roughly handled by the police. Under continued pressure from the WSPU, the Liberal government re-introduced the Conciliation Bill the following year. Exasperated by the continued opposition and by the bill&#x27;s limitations, on 21 November 1911, the WSPU carried out an &quot;official&quot; window smash along Whitehall and Fleet Street. Its target included the offices of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot; and the official residences or homes of leading Liberal politicians. 160 suffragettes were arrested. The Conciliation Bill was debated in March 1912, and was defeated by 14 votes.

The WSPU responded by organising a new and broader campaign of direct action. Once this got underway with the wholesale smashing of shop windows, the government ordered arrests of the leadership. Although they had disagreed with strategy, Frederick and Emmeline Pethwick-Lawrence, were sentenced to nine months imprisonment for conspiracy and successfully sued for the cost of the property damage.

Some WSPU militants, however, were prepared to go beyond outrages against property. On 18 July 1912, in Dublin Mary Leigh threw a hatchet that narrowly missed the head of the visiting prime minister H. H. Asquith. On 29 January 1913, several letter bombs were sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, and the prime minister Asquith, but they all exploded in post offices, post boxes or in mailbags while in transit across the country. Between February and March 1913, railway signal wires were purposely cut on lines across the country endangering train journeys.

On 19 February 1913, as part of a wider suffragette bombing and arson campaign, a bomb was set off in Pinfold Manor, the country home of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lloyd George, which brought down ceilings and cracked walls. On the evening of the incident Emmeline Pankhurst claimed responsibility, announcing at a public meeting in Cardiff, we have “blown up the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s house”. Pankhurst was willing to be arrested for the incident saying “I have advised, I have incited, I have conspired”; and that if she was arrested for the incident she would prove that the “punishment unjustly imposed upon women who have no voice in making the laws cannot be carried out”. On 3 April Pankhurst was sentenced to three years’ penal servitude for procuring and inciting women to commit &quot;malicious injuries to property&quot;. The Temporary Discharge for Ill Health Bill was rushed through Parliament to ensure that Pankhurst, who had immediately gone on hunger strike, did not die in prison.

In response to the bomb Lloyd George wrote an article in &quot;Nash&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, entitled “Votes for Women and Organised Lunacy” where he argued that the “main obstacle to women getting the vote is militancy”. It had alienated those who would have supported them. The only way for women to get the vote is a new movement “absolutely divorced from stones and bombs and torches”.

On the last day of April, the WSPU offices were raided by the police, and a number of women were arrested and taken to Bow Street. They were Flora Drummond, Harriett Roberta Kerr, Agnes Lake, Rachel Barrett, Laura Geraldine Lennox and Beatrice Sanders. All were charged under the Malicious Damages Act of 1861, found guilty and received various sentences.

In the same month, April 1913, Dorothy Evans, posted as an organiser to the north of Ireland, was arrested in Belfast on explosive charges. Together with local activist Midge Muir, she created uproar in court demanding to know why the gun-running Ulster Unionist James Craig was not appearing on the same charges.

In June 1913 Emily Davison was killed while attempting to drape a suffragette banner on the King&#x27;s horse as it was racing in the Epsom Derby—an incident famously captured on film.

On the evening of 9 March 1914 in Glasgow, about 40 militant suffragettes, including members of the Bodyguard team, brawled with several squads of police constables who were attempting to re-arrest Emmeline Pankhurst during a pro-suffrage rally at St. Andrew&#x27;s Hall. The following day, suffragette Mary Richardson (known as one of the most militant activists, also called &quot;Slasher&quot; Richardson) walked into the National Gallery in London and attacked Diego Velázquez&#x27;s painting, &quot;Rokeby Venus&quot; with a meat cleaver. Her action stimulated a wave of attacks on artworks that would continue for five months. In June, militants had placed a bomb beneath the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey.

Released following a hunger strike, in July 1914 Dorothy Evans was again arrested in Belfast. With a sister Hunger Strike Medalist, Lillian Metge, she was implicated in a series of arson attacks and the bombing of Lisburn Cathedral.

== Hunger strikes ==
In response to the continuing and repeated imprisonment of many of their members, the WSPU extended and supported prison hunger strikes. The authorities&#x27; policy of force feeding won the suffragettes public sympathy and induced the government later passed the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913. More commonly known as the &quot;Cat and Mouse Act&quot;, this allowed the release of suffragettes, close to death due to malnourishment, and their re-arrest once health was restored. The WSPU fought back: their all-women security team known as the Bodyguard, trained in ju-jitsu by Edith Margaret Garrud and led by Gertrude Harding, protected temporarily released suffragettes from arrest and recommital. The WSPU also coordinated a campaign in which doctors such as Flora Murray and Elizabeth Gould Bell treated the imprisoned suffragettes.

A special medal, the Hunger Strike Medal, like a military honour was designed by Sylvia Pankhurst and awarded &#x27;for Valour&#x27; to women who had been on hunger strike/force-fed.

== Splits and currents ==
Differences over direct action contributed to splits in the organisation. Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, who with her husband Frederick edited &quot;Votes for Women&quot;, was expelled in 1912. Christabel Pankhurst launched a new WPSU journal, fully committed to the militant strategy, &quot;The Suffragette.&quot; The Pethick-Lawrences then joined Agnes Harben and others in starting the United Suffragists, which was open to women and men, militants and non-militants alike.

Within the WPSU radical action was championed by the “Young Hot Bloods” or “YHB”. These were a group of younger unmarried women formed by Annie Kenney’s sister Jessie and Adela Pankhurst in 1907. The group’s name derived from a newspaper comment: &quot;Mrs Pankhurst will of course be followed blindly by a number of the younger and more hot-blooded members of the Union”. Members of the group included Irene Dallas, Grace Roe, Jessie Kenney, Elsie Howey, Vera Wentworth and Mary Home.

Sylvia Pankhurst and her East London Federation were expelled early in 1914. They had argued for an explicitly socialist organisation, aligned with the Independent Labour Party, and focused on working-class collective action rather than individual attacks on property. They renamed themselves the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELFS) and launched a newspaper, the &quot;Women&#x27;s Dreadnought&quot;.

==During the First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Christabel Pankhurst was living in Paris, in order to run the organisation without fear of arrest. Her autocratic control enabled her, over the objections of Kitty Marion and others, to declare soon after war broke out that the WSPU should abandon its campaigns in favour of a nationalistic stance, supporting the British government in the war. The WSPU stopped publishing &quot;The Suffragette&quot;, and in April 1915 it launched a new journal, &quot;Britannia&quot;. While the majority of WSPU members supported the war, a small number formed the Suffragettes of the Women&#x27;s Social Political Union (SWSPU) and the Independent Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (IWSPU), led by Charlotte Marsh, and including Edith Rigby and Dorothy Evans.

The WSPU faded from public attention and was dissolved in 1917, with Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst founding the Women&#x27;s Party.

== Suffrage drama ==
Between 1905 and 1914 suffrage drama and theatre forums became increasingly utilised by the women&#x27;s movement. Around this same time, however, the WSPU also became increasingly associated with militancy, moving from marches, demonstrations, and other public performances to more avant-garde and inflammatory “acts of violence.” The organisation began using these shock tactics to demonstrate the seriousness and urgency of the cause. Their demonstrations included “window smashing, museum-painting slashing, arson, fuse box bombing, and telegraph line cutting,”—suffrage playwrights, in turn, began using their work to combat the negative press around the movement and attempted to demonstrate in performance how these acts of violence only occur as a last resort. They attempted to transform the negative, yet popular perspective of these militant acts as being the actions of irrational, hysterical, ‘overly-emotional’ women and instead demonstrate how these protests were merely the only logical response to being denied a basic fundamental right.

Suffragettes not only used theatre to their advantage, but they also employed the use of comedy. The Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union was one of the first organisations to capitalise on comedic satirical writing and use it to outwit their opposition. It not only helped them diffuse hostility towards their organisation, but also helped them gain an audience. This use of satire allowed them to express their ideas and frustrations as well as combat gender prejudices in a safer way. Suffrage speakers, who often held open-air meetings in order to reach a wider audience, had to face hostile audiences and learn how to deal with interruptions. The most successful speakers, therefore, had to acquire a quick wit and learn to &quot;always to get the best of a joke, and to join in the laughter with the audience even if the joke was against&quot; them. Suffragette Annie Kenney recalls an elderly man continuously jeering “if you were my wife I’d give you poison&quot; throughout the course of her speech, to which she replied &quot;yes, and if I were your wife I’d take it,&quot; diffusing threats and making her antagonist appear laughable.

<doc id="577966" wikidata="Q1413792" url="?curid=577966" title="Slip angle">
<text>In vehicle dynamics, slip angle or sideslip angle is the angle between the direction in which a wheel is pointing and the direction in which it is actually traveling (i.e., the angle between the forward velocity vector formula_1 and the vector sum of wheel forward velocity formula_1 and lateral velocity formula_3, as defined in the image to the right). This slip angle results in a force, the cornering force, which is in the plane of the contact patch and perpendicular to the intersection of the contact patch and the midplane of the wheel. This cornering force increases approximately linearly for the first few degrees of slip angle, then increases non-linearly to a maximum before beginning to decrease.

The slip angle, formula_4 is defined as formula_5

== Causes ==
A non-zero slip angle arises because of deformation in the tire carcass and tread. As the tire rotates, the friction between the contact patch and the road results in individual tread &#x27;elements&#x27; (finite sections of tread) remaining stationary with respect to the road. If a side-slip velocity &quot;u&quot; is introduced, the contact patch will be deformed. When a tread element enters the contact patch, the friction between the road and the tire causes the tread element to remain stationary, yet the tire continues to move laterally. Thus the tread element will be ‘deflected’ sideways. While it is equally valid to frame this as the tire/wheel being deflected away from the stationary tread element, convention is for the co-ordinate system to be fixed around the wheel mid-plane.

While the tread element moves through the contact patch it is deflected further from the wheel mid-plane. This deflection gives rise to the slip angle, and to the cornering force. The rate at which the cornering force builds up is described by the relaxation length.

== Effects ==
The ratios between the slip angles of the front and rear axles (a function of the slip angles of the front and rear tires respectively) will determine the vehicle&#x27;s behavior in a given turn. If the ratio of front to rear slip angles is greater than 1:1, the vehicle will tend to understeer, while a ratio of less than 1:1 will produce oversteer. Actual instantaneous slip angles depend on many factors, including the condition of the road surface, but a vehicle&#x27;s suspension can be designed to promote specific dynamic characteristics. A principal means of adjusting developed slip angles is to alter the relative roll couple (the rate at which weight transfers from the inside to the outside wheel in a turn) front to rear by varying the relative amount of front and rear lateral load transfer. This can be achieved by modifying the height of the roll centers, or by adjusting roll stiffness, either through suspension changes or the addition of an anti-roll bar.

Because of asymmetries in the side-slip along the length of the contact patch, the resultant force of this side-slip occurs away from the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire, the so-called self aligning torque.

== Measurement of slip angle ==
There are two main ways to measure slip angle of a tire: on a vehicle as it moves, or on a dedicated testing device.

There are a number of devices which can be used to measure slip angle on a vehicle as it moves; some use optical methods, some use inertial methods, some GPS and some both GPS and inertial.

Various test machines have been developed to measure slip angle in a controlled environment. A motorcycle tire test machine is located at the University of Padua. That uses a 3-meter diameter disk that rotates under a tire held at a fixed steer and camber angle, up to 54 degrees. Sensors measure the force and moment generated, and a correction is made to account for the curvature of the track. Other devices use the inner or outer surface of rotating drums, sliding planks, conveyor belts, or a trailer that presses the test tire to an actual road surface.

<text>The John Innes Centre (JIC), located in Norwich, Norfolk, England, is an independent centre for research and training in plant and microbial science founded in 1910. It is a registered charity (No 223852) grant-aided by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the European Research Council (ERC) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is a member of the Norwich Research Park. In 2017, the John Innes Centre was awarded a gold Athena SWAN Charter award.

==History==
The John Innes Horticultural Institution was founded in 1910 at Merton Park, Surrey (now London Borough of Merton), with funds bequeathed by John Innes, a merchant and philanthropist. The Institution occupied Innes&#x27;s former estate at Merton Park, Surrey until 1945 when it moved to Bayfordbury, Hertfordshire. It moved to its present site in 1967.

In 1910, William Bateson became the first director of the John Innes Horticultural Institution and moved with his family to Merton Park. John Innes compost was developed by the institution in the 1930s, who donated the recipe to the &quot;Dig for Victory&quot; war effort. The John Innes Centre has never sold John Innes compost.

During the 1980s, the administration of the John Innes Institute was combined with that of the Plant Breeding Institute (formerly at Trumpington, Cambridgeshire) and the Nitrogen Fixation Laboratory. In 1994, following the relocation of the operations of other two organisations to the Norwich site, the three were merged as the John Innes Centre.

As of 2011 the institute was divided into six departments: Biological Chemistry, Cell &amp; Developmental Biology, Computational &amp; Systems Biology, Crop Genetics, Metabolic Biology and Molecular Microbiology.

The John Innes Centre has a tradition of training PhD students and post-docs. PhD degrees obtained via the John Innes Centre are awarded by the University of East Anglia. The John Innes Centre has a contingent of postdoctoral researchers, many of whom are recruited onto the institute&#x27;s Post-doctoral Training Fellowship programme. The John Innes Centre also sponsors seminars and lectures, including the Bateson Lecture, Biffen Lecture, Chatt Lecture, Darlington Lecture and Haldane Lecture. In February 2025, the John Innes Centre announced the appointment of Professor Cristóbal Uauy as its next director, effective September 2025.

==Research==
The research at the John Innes Centre is divided into four Institute Strategic Programs (ISPs) funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). These ISPs, which combine the research of multiple groups to address a greater aim, were, from 2017 to 2023 as follows: 
*Genes in the Environment - aims to develop a wider and deeper understanding of how the environment influences plant growth and development.
*Molecules from Nature - will investigate the vast diversity of chemicals produced by plants and microbes.
*Plant Health - aims to understand the molecular dialogue between plants and microbes, establishing how they communicate with each other and how they have evolved in relation to one another.
*Designing Future Wheat - a program with other BBSRC institutes Rothamsted Research and National Institute for Agricultural Botany (NIAB) and the University of Nottingham and the University of Bristol.

==Affiliations==
The John Innes Centre co-located with The Sainsbury Laboratory (Norwich), an institute focused studying plant disease. The Sainsbury Laboratory is closely affiliated with the University of East Anglia. Along with the Institute of Food Research and University of East Anglia (UEA), JIC hosted the BA Festival of Science (now the British Science Festival) in September 2006. The John Innes Centre, University of East Anglia (UEA) The Sainsbury Laboratory, The Earlham Institute and Quadram Institute Bioscience have since 2016, run Women of the Future an event aimed at promoting career in science to young women.

==Directors==
The John Innes Centre has been directed by:
* William Bateson (1910–1926)
* A. Daniel Hall (1926–1939)
* C. D. Darlington (1939–1953)
* Kenneth Dodds (1953–1967)
* Roy Markham (1967–1980)
* Harold Woolhouse (1980–1988)

==Notable staff and alumni==
Notable staff and alumni include:
==John Innes Foundation==
The John Innes Foundation (JIF) is an independent charitable foundation (registered Charity No. 1111527) and was formed in 1910 by John Innes. JIF set up the John Innes Horticultural Institution (JIHI) in London. Currently, the JIF owns the land and buildings at Newfound Farm in Bawburgh, Norfolk which are used by researchers from the John Innes Centre. The JIF trustees also play an active part in the management of John Innes Centre research and have the right to appoint three members of the Governing Council. The foundation sponsors several graduate studentships each year, support for educational programmes and the infrastructure of the site. They also fund student awards for scientific excellence and science communication. It also owns a very significant collection of archive material held in the Historical Collections library at the John Innes Centre.

==The Special Collection and the History of Genetics Library==
The John Innes Centre is home to a collection of rare botanical books, lab books, manuscripts and letters documenting the history of genetics and research carried out by its scientists. This includes a letter from William Bateson documenting the first use of the word &quot;genetics&quot;. The History of Genetics library also contains the archives of the Genetical Society.

== Germplasm Resources Unit ==
An important part of the John Innes Centre is the John Innes Centre Germplasm Resources Unit (GRU). This seedbank houses a number of germplasm collections, including the Watkins Landrace Wheat Collection, the John Innes Centre Pisum Collection, BBSRC Small Grain Cereal Collection, Crop wild relative collection and several specialist genetic stocks collections. This material is extensively used by UK and non-UK researchers and breeders, and is an available upon request to research, academic and commercial efforts, subject to availability. The complete list of the material can be found in the GRU database.

<doc id="577975" wikidata="Q55664453" url="?curid=577975" title="Understeer and oversteer">
<text>Understeer and oversteer are vehicle dynamics terms used to describe the sensitivity of the vehicle to changes in steering angle associated with changes in lateral acceleration. This sensitivity is defined for a level road for a given steady state operating condition by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in document J670 and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in document 8855. Whether the vehicle is understeer or oversteer depends on the rate of change of the understeer angle. The Understeer Angle is the amount of additional steering (at the road wheels, not the hand wheel) that must be added in any given steady-state maneuver beyond the Ackermann steer angle. The [[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackermann Steer]] Angle is the steer angle at which the vehicle would travel about a curve when there is no lateral acceleration required (at negligibly low speed).

The Understeer Gradient (U) is the rate of change of the understeer angle with respect to lateral acceleration on a level road for a given steady state operating condition. 

The vehicle is Understeer if the understeer gradient is positive, Oversteer if the understeer gradient is negative, and Neutral steer if the understeer gradient is zero. 

Car and motorsport enthusiasts often use the terminology informally in magazines and blogs to describe vehicle response to steering in a variety of manoueuvres.

==Dynamics==
===Test to determine understeer gradient===
Several tests can be used to determine understeer gradient: constant radius (repeat tests at different speeds), constant speed (repeat tests with different steering angles), or constant steer (repeat tests at different speeds). Formal descriptions of these three kinds of testing are provided by ISO. Gillespie goes into some detail on two of the measurement methods.

Results depend on the type of test, so simply giving a deg/g value is not sufficient; it is also necessary to indicate the type of procedure used to measure the gradient.

Vehicles are inherently nonlinear systems, and it is normal for U to vary over the range of testing. It is possible for a vehicle to show understeer in some conditions and oversteer in others. Therefore, it is necessary to specify the speed and lateral acceleration whenever reporting understeer/oversteer characteristics.

===Contributions to understeer gradient===
Many properties of the vehicle affect the understeer gradient, including tyre cornering stiffness, camber thrust, lateral force compliance steer, self aligning torque, lateral weight transfer, and compliance in the steering system. Weight distribution affects the normal force on each tyre and therefore its grip. These individual contributions can be identified analytically or by measurement in a Bundorf analysis.

=== In contrast to limit handling behavior ===
Great care must be taken to avoid conflating the understeer/oversteer behavior with the limit behavior of a vehicle. The physics are very different. They have different handling implications and different causes. The former is concerned with tire distortion effects due to slip and camber angles as increasing levels of lateral acceleration are attained. The latter is concerned with the limiting friction case in which either the front or rear wheels become saturated first. It is best to use race driver&#x27;s descriptive terms &quot;push (plow) and loose (spin)&quot; for limit behavior so that these concepts are not confused.

=== Limit handling characteristics ===
Tyres transmit lateral (side to side) and longitudinal (front to back) forces to the ground. The total traction force (grip) available to the a tyre is the vector sum of the lateral and longitudinal forces, a function of the normal force and coefficient of friction. If the lateral and longitudinal forces presented at the tyre during operations exceeds the tyre&#x27;s available traction force then the tyre is said to be saturated and will loose its grip on the ground and start to slip.

Push (plow) can be understood as a condition where, while cornering, the front tyres become saturated before the rear and slip first. Since the front tyres cannot provide any additional lateral force and the rear tyres can, the front of the vehicle will follow a path of greater radius than the rear and if there are no changes to the steering angle (i.e. the steering wheel stays in the same position), the vehicle&#x27;s front will slide to the outside of the curve.

If the rear tyres become saturated before the front, the front tyres will keep the front of the vehicle on the desired path but the rear tyres will slip and follow a path with a greater radius. The back end will swing out and the vehicle will turn toward the inside of the curve. If the steering angle is not changed, then the front wheels will trace out a smaller and smaller circle while the rear wheels continue to swing around the front of the car. This is what is happening when a car &#x27;spins out&#x27;. A car susceptible to being &quot;loose&quot; is sometimes known as &#x27;tail happy&#x27;, as in the way a dog wags its tail when happy and a common problem is fishtailing.

In real-world driving, there are continuous changes in speed, acceleration (vehicle braking or accelerating), steering angle, etc. Those changes are all constantly altering the load distribution of the vehicle, which, along with changes in tyre temperatures and road surface conditions are is constantly changing the maximum traction force available at each tyre. Generally, though, it is changes to the center of mass which cause tyre saturation and inform limit handling characteristics.

If the center of mass is moved forward, the understeer gradient tends to increase due to tyre load sensitivity. When the center of mass is moved rearward, the understeer gradient tends to decrease. The shifting of the center of mass is proportional to acceleration and affected by the height of the center of mass. When braking, more of the vehicles weight (load) is put on the front tyres and an less on the rear tyres. Conversely, when the vehicle accelerates, the opposite happens, the weight shifts to the rear tires. Similarly, as the center of mass of the load is shifted from one side to the other, the inside or outside tyres traction changes. In extreme cases, the inside or front tyres may completely lift off the ground, eliminating or reducing the steering input that can be transferred to the ground.

While weight distribution and suspension geometry have the greatest effect on measured understeer gradient in a steady-state test, power distribution, brake bias and front-rear weight transfer will also affect which wheels lose traction first in many real-world scenarios.

==Limit conditions==
When an understeering vehicle is taken to the grip limit of the tyres, where it is no longer possible to increase lateral acceleration, the vehicle will follow a path with a radius larger than intended. Although the vehicle cannot increase lateral acceleration, it is dynamically stable.

When an oversteering vehicle is taken to the grip limit of the tyres, it becomes dynamically unstable with a tendency to spin. Although the vehicle is unstable in open-loop control, a skilled driver can maintain control past the point of instability with countersteering and/or correct use of the throttle or even brakes; this is done purposely in the sport of drifting.

If a rear-wheel-drive vehicle has enough power to spin the rear wheels, it can initiate oversteer at any time by sending enough engine power to the wheels that they start spinning. Once traction is broken, they are relatively free to swing laterally. Under braking load, more work is typically done by the front brakes. If this forward bias is too great, then the front tyres may lose traction, causing understeer.

==Related measures==
Understeer gradient is one of the main measures for characterizing steady-state cornering behavior. It is involved in other properties such as characteristic speed (the speed for an understeer vehicle where the steer angle needed to negotiate a turn is twice the Ackermann angle), lateral acceleration gain (g&#x27;s/deg), yaw velocity gain (1/s), and critical speed (the speed where an oversteer vehicle has infinite lateral acceleration gain).

<text>Michael Jeremy Thomas Clyde (born 22 March 1941) is an English actor and musician. During the 1960s, he was one-half of the folk duo Chad &amp; Jeremy (with Chad Stuart). Their first song was the 1963 hit &quot;Yesterday’s Gone&quot;. The duo became more successful in America than in their native country. Clyde has enjoyed a long television acting career, often playing upper-middle class or aristocratic characters.

==Early life==
Clyde was born in the village of Dorney in the English county of Buckinghamshire and is the son of Lady Elizabeth Wellesley and her then-husband Thomas Clyde.

Through his maternal line, Clyde is the great-great-great-grandson of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, and is a cousin of the current Duke of Wellington.

In 1953, he participated in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II as a Page of Honour for his grandfather and carried his grandfather&#x27;s coronet during the ceremony.

Clyde was educated at two independent schools, Ludgrove and Eton, and then at the University of Grenoble.

==Television==

In 1970, he played Teddy, the prospective buyer of a haunted house, in the &#x27;Suspicious Ignorance&#x27; episode of &quot;Tales of Unease&quot;, alongside Tessa Wyatt.

Clyde once guest-starred in an episode of the American sitcom &quot;My Three Sons&quot; (season 8 episode 7, &quot;Liverpool Saga&quot;), when Chip Douglas is introduced to their neighbor&#x27;s cousin, Paul Drayton, as a well known folk guitarist in Britain, excited that someone from Liverpool was coming to visit and expecting him to be a talented musician (implying the success of the Beatles; the episode aired during the height of Beatlemania).

He appeared in the BBC TV adaptation of &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; in 1975.

In 1979, he played Godfried Schalcken in the BBC&#x27;s television horror story &quot;Schalcken the Painter&quot;.

In the late 1970s he appeared alongside Lorraine Chase in a series of television advertisements for Campari. 

He is perhaps best known for his portrayal of villainous Austrian Imperial Governor Hermann Gessler, in the action series &quot;Crossbow&quot; (1987–1989), which incorporated Clyde&#x27;s ability to convey evil in a distinctly aristocratic way. 

His other notable acting role was as Dick Spackman in the ITV sitcom &quot;Is it Legal?&quot;.

Clyde also portrayed King Charles I in the BBC series &quot;By the Sword Divided&quot; (1983–85), which depicted the English Civil War. 

Clyde also starred as Algernon Moncrieff in 1985 in the &quot;Great Performances&quot; production of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, opposite Gary Bond as Jack Worthing and Dame Wendy Hiller as Lady Bracknell. 

In the same year, he played the civil servant Densher in &quot;Blott on the Landscape&quot;.

In 2002, Clyde appeared in &quot;The Falklands Play&quot; (a BBC dramatisation of the Falklands War) as Sir Nicholas Henderson, the British ambassador to the United States at the time. 

In 2004, he appeared in the BBC drama series &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot; as British Conservative politician Jonathan Aitken, and also appeared in the BBC drama series &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot; as the Superintendent, which was aired in 2008.

==Radio==
He has also acted on the radio, portraying the gentleman thief A. J. Raffles in the BBC radio series &quot;Raffles&quot; (1985–1993). He has also portrayed Ngaio Marsh&#x27;s fictional detective Inspector Roderick Alleyn.

==Theatre==

In 1965, Clyde appeared in a stage production of &quot;The Passion Flower Hotel&quot;, a musical adaptation written by John Barry and Trevor Peacock, at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London. It also featured Jane Birkin, Francesca Annis, Pauline Collins, Nicky Henson, and Bill Kenwright.

In 1969, he appeared in &quot;Conduct Unbecoming&quot; as part of the original cast, which included Paul Jones. He also travelled to the US as part of the original Broadway cast.

In 2011, Clyde played Lord Halifax in &quot;Three Days in May&quot; at Trafalgar Studios in London. The play, which featured actor Warren Clarke as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was set during May 1940, at a point in WWII when the idea of negotiating peace with Hitler was being floated around.

In 2017 he played Dennis in &quot;The Girls&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre in the West End.

==Other performances==

He also played in&quot; The Iron Lady&quot;, in (2011).

Since 2018, Clyde has been performing with Peter Asher of Peter &amp; Gordon fame.

==Personal life==
Clyde is the oldest of three sons born to Lady Elizabeth Clyde and Captain Thomas Clyde.

Clyde is divorced from Vanessa Field, whom he married in 1970 at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York City. They have two children.

<text>The Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA) was a centrist political party in British Columbia, Canada founded by Gordon Wilson, Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Powell River—Sunshine Coast.

Wilson, previously the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party, led that party through a breakthrough in the provincial election of 1991, in which they rose from no parliamentary representation to official opposition status. He was unable to hold his caucus together, however, and was forced to call a leadership convention following revelations about his personal relationship with another member of the small Liberal caucus, Judi Tyabji, MLA for Okanagan East. Tyabji and Wilson were both married to others at the time; they subsequently divorced and married each other. Many in the Liberal Party believed that their relationship created at least the potential for a serious conflict of interest.

After losing the leadership challenge to Gordon Campbell, who in turn led the party to victory in the 2001 provincial election, Wilson and Tyabji left the party to establish the Progressive Democratic Alliance on December 5, 1993.

In the subsequent June 26, 1996 general election, Wilson retained his seat, while all 65 other PDA candidates, including Tyabji, were defeated. The party won a total of 90,797 votes, or 5.74% of the popular vote.

The PDA was disbanded by Wilson in 1999 when he joined the ruling New Democratic Party of British Columbia to become a member of Cabinet. He later ran for the provincial NDP leadership, but lost to Ujjal Dosanjh. He lost his legislative seat in the 2001 provincial election.

In 2004, former party activists attempted to resuscitate the PDA. Finding financial obstacles, they instead formed the British Columbia Democratic Alliance, billing it as a successor organization.

<text>Hassan Fathy (; March 23, 1900 – November 30, 1989) was a noted Egyptian architect who pioneered appropriate technology for building in Egypt, especially by working to reestablish the use of adobe and traditional mud construction as opposed to western building designs, material configurations, and lay-outs. Fathy was recognized with the Aga Khan Chairman&#x27;s Award for Architecture in 1980.

==Personal life==
Hassan Fathy was born in Alexandria to a Middle Class Upper Egyptian family. He studied and trained as an architect in Egypt, graduating in 1926 from the King Fuad University (now Cairo University). Fathy married Aziza Hassanein, sister of Ahmed Hassanein. He was influenced by Upper Egyptian and simple rural architecture, he designed a villa with the southern style for his wife along the Nile in Maadi, which was later destroyed to make way for the new corniche. He also designed her brother&#x27;s mausoleum (1947), along Salah Salem, in Neo-Mamluk style.

==Career==

Hassan Fathy was a cosmopolitan trilingual professor-engineer-architect, amateur musician, dramatist, and inventor. He designed nearly 160 separate projects, from modest country retreats to fully planned communities with police, fire, and medical services, markets, schools, theatres, and places for worship and recreation. These communities included many functional buildings such as laundry facilities, ovens, and wells. He utilized ancient design methods and materials, as well as knowledge of the rural Egyptian economic situation with a wide knowledge of ancient architectural and town design techniques. He trained local inhabitants to make their own materials and build their own buildings.

===Early career/New Gourna===

He began teaching at the College of Fine Arts in 1930 and designed his first adobe buildings in the late 1930s.

Fathy gained international critical acclaim for his involvement in the construction of New Gourna, located on Luxor&#x27;s West Bank, built to resettle the village of Gourna, which fell within the archaeological areas of the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens. 

Fathy&#x27;s plan devised groundbreaking approaches to economic, social, and aesthetic issues that typically impact the construction of low-cost housing.

With regard to the economic issues, Fathy noted that structural steel was not an apt choice for a poor country, and that even materials such as cement, timber, and glass did not make good economic sense. To address this issue, Fathy instead devised a plan that included the use of appropriate technology, notably mud brick construction.

Noting that the traditional village, although afflicted with issues of overcrowding and poor sanitation was also an expression of “a living society in all its complexity,” Fathy strived to design New Gourna in a manner that addressed the social concerns, including attempting to consult directly with &quot;every family in Gourna&quot; and advocating for the involvement of social ethnographers in the planning process. Despite this, inhabitants of the former village were not enthusiastic about relocating, which effectively cut them off from their existing livelihood of trading in archaeological finds.

With regard to aesthetic issues, Fathy placed emphasis on traditional Nubian architectural designs which he observed in a 1941 trip to the region (enclosed courtyards; vaulted roofing), yielding what Fathy described as &quot;spacious, lovely, clean, and harmonious houses.&quot; He also made use of traditional Nubian ornamental techniques (claustra, a form of mud latticework), as well as vernacular architecture techniques of the Gourna region. Some critics have observed, however, that Fathy&#x27;s project for Gourna is not a superlative example of how to prioritize vernacular architecture in an urban plan, given that the domed architecture Fathy championed is traditionally used for funerary architecture rather than residential or domestic spaces.

Despite the effort, and also the proper issues he tackled while building New Gourna, through his publication, &quot;Architecture for the Poor&quot;, he describes the &quot;Gourna Experiment&quot; as a failure. He mentions in &quot;Architecture for the Poor&quot; the Gourna experiment failed.&quot;

He further describes the sense of failure that due to the village not being completed and the construction being halted, the theory of mud brick construction was seen even more cranky and impractical. Despite the theory being completely lost, that there wasn&#x27;t anyone that tried to find other practical ways of getting peasant houses built efficiently. There were more issues he came across, such as him stating &quot;This is because no architect knows the real cost of building.&quot; Although he dives further into that thought, by speaking on how nobody realistically knows the price or cost, because we’re at the mercy of the economy. Despite the negative outlooks he had writing these books, he managed to make Gourna a community, and till this day is still preserved with only 40% of the original buildings being lost. It&#x27;s still standing due to being placed on the 2010 World Monuments Watch, and UNESCO and World Monuments Fund joined forces.

=== Later career ===

In 1953 he returned to Cairo, heading the Architectural Section of the Faculty of Fine Arts in 1954.

Fathy&#x27;s next major engagement was designing and supervising school construction for Egypt&#x27;s Ministry of Education.

Through his work of the years, and especially after New Gourna, he targeted bureaucracy being one of the leading reasons that the experiment failed, which influenced later actions such as in 1957, frustrated with bureaucracy and convinced that buildings designed with traditional methods appropriate to the climate of the area would speak louder than words, he moved to Athens to collaborate with international planners evolving the principles of ekistical design under the direction of Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis. He served as the advocate of traditional natural-energy solutions in major community projects for Iraq and Pakistan and undertook extended travel and research for the &quot;Cities of the Future&quot; program in Africa.

Returning to Cairo in 1963, he moved to Darb al-Labbana, near the Cairo Citadel, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. He also did public speaking and private consulting. He was a man with a riveting message in an era searching for alternatives in fuel, personal interactions, and economic supports.

He left his first major international position, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston, in 1969 to complete multiple trips per year as a leading critical member of the architectural profession.

His participation in the first U.N. Habitat conference in 1976 in Vancouver which was followed shortly by two events that significantly shaped the rest of his activities. He began to serve on the steering committee for the nascent Aga Khan Award for Architecture and he founded and set guiding principles for his Institute of Appropriate Technology.

He was part in 1979 of a colloquium entitled in his honour &#x27;Architecture for the Poor&#x27; in Corsica (France) Alzipratu.

In 1980, he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Architecture and Urban Planning and the Right Livelihood Award.

Fathy designed the mosque and madrasa, constructed with adobe, at Dar al-Islam, an educational center near Abiquiú, New Mexico, US. The main buildings were completed in 1981, and Dar al-Islam opened in 1982.

== Death ==
Hassan Fathy died of natural causes on November 30, 1989, at his home in Cairo, Egypt.
== Legacy ==
Fathy has been called Egypt&#x27;s best-known architect since Imhotep.

Fathy&#x27;s New Gourna project was applauded in a popular British weekly in 1947 and soon after in a British professional journal; further articles were published in Spanish, French and in Dutch. Later, Fathy would author a book on the New Gourna project, initially published by Cairo&#x27;s Ministry of Culture in a limited edition in 1969, entitled &quot;Gourna: A Tale of Two Villages&quot;. In 1973 it was republished by the University of Chicago as &quot;Architecture for the Poor: An Experiment in Rural Egypt&quot;.

A full appreciation of the importance of Fathy&#x27;s contribution to world architecture became clear only as the twentieth century waned. Climatic conditions, public health considerations, and ancient craft skills also affected his design decisions. Based on the structural massing of ancient buildings, Fathy incorporated dense brick walls and traditional courtyard forms to provide passive cooling. Fathy is also renowned for having revived the traditional Nubian vault.

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/37) with Hassan Fathy in 1986 for its Architects Lives&#x27; collection held by the British Library.

Hassan Fathy made use of windcatchers and other passive cooling and passive ventilation methods from traditional architecture. He wrote a book on them.
Fathy is featured in the documentary &quot;Il ne suffit pas que dieu soit avec les pauvres&quot; (1978) by Borhane Alaouié and Lotfi Thabet.

== Collection ==
Hassan Fathy&#x27;s entire archive which includes his architectural plans, photographs and documents is housed at the Rare Books and Special Collections Library at the American University in Cairo.&#x27; The collection includes around 5000 architectural plans, 15,000 photographs and his correspondences, writings and other collected papers and materials.

== Publications ==
Hassan Fathy has a number of publications. His first book &quot;Architecture for the Poor&quot;, was initially published by the Egyptian Ministry of Culture in 1969 under the title &quot;Al-Gurna: A Tale of Two Villages.&quot;

<doc id="577991" wikidata="Q1675349" url="?curid=577991" title="Service life">
<text>A product&#x27;s service life is its period of use in service. Several related terms describe more precisely a product&#x27;s life, from the point of manufacture, storage, and distribution, and eventual use.
Service life has been defined as &quot;a product&#x27;s total life in use from the point of sale to the point of discard&quot; and distinguished from replacement life, &quot;the period after which the initial purchaser returns to the shop for a replacement&quot;. Determining a product&#x27;s expected service life as part of business policy (product life cycle management) involves using tools and calculations from maintainability and reliability analysis. Service life represents a commitment made by the item&#x27;s manufacturer and is usually specified as a median. It is the time that any manufactured item can be expected to be &quot;serviceable&quot; or supported by its manufacturer.

Service life is not to be confused with &quot;shelf life&quot;, which deals with storage time, or with technical life, which is the maximum period during which it can physically function. Service life also differs from &quot;predicted life&quot;, in terms of mean time before failure (MTBF) or maintenance-free operating period (MFOP). Predicted life is useful such that a manufacturer may estimate, by hypothetical modeling and calculation, a general rule for which it will honor warranty claims, or planning for mission fulfillment. The difference between service life and predicted life is most clear when considering mission time and reliability in comparison to MTBF and service life. For example, a missile system can have a mission time of less than one minute, service life of 20 years, active MTBF of 20 minutes, dormant MTBF of 50 years, and reliability of 99.9999%.

Consumers will have different expectations about service life and longevity based upon factors such as use, cost, and quality.

== Product strategy ==

Manufacturers will commit to very conservative service life, usually 2 to 5 years for most commercial and consumer products (for example computer peripherals and components). However, for large and expensive durable goods, the items are not consumable, and service lives and maintenance activity will factor large in the service life. Again, an airliner might have a mission time of 11 hours, a predicted active MTBF of 10,000 hours without maintenance (or 15,000 hours with maintenance), reliability of .99999, and a service life of 40 years.

The most common model for item lifetime is the bathtub curve, a plot of the varying failure rate as a function of time. During early life, the bathtub shows increased failures, usually witnessed during product development. The middle portion of the bathtub, or &#x27;useful life&#x27;, is a slightly inclined, nearly constant failure rate period where the consumer enjoys the benefit conferred by the product. As time increases further, the curve reaches a period of increasing failures, modeling the product&#x27;s wear-out phase.

For an individual product, the component parts may each have independent service lives, resulting in several bathtub curves. For instance, a tire will have a service life partitioning related to the tread and the casing.

== Examples ==
For maintainable items, those wear-out items that are determined by logistical analysis to be provisioned for sparing and replacement will assure a longer service life than manufactured items without such planning. A simple example is automotive tires - failure to plan for this wear out item would limit automotive service life to the extent of a single set of tires.

An individual tire&#x27;s life follows the bathtub curve, to boot. After installation, there is a not-small probability of failure which may be related to material or workmanship or even to the process for mounting the tire which may introduce some small damage. After the initial period, the tire will perform, given no defect introducing events such as encountering a road hazard (a nail or a pothole), for a long duration relative to its expected service life which is a function of several variables (design, material, process). After a period, the failure probability will rise; for some tires, this will occur after the tread is worn out. Then, a secondary market for tires puts a retread on the tire thereby extending the service life. It is not uncommon for an 80,000-mile tire to perform well beyond that limit.

It may be difficult to obtain reliable longevity data about many consumer products as, in general, efforts at actuarial analysis are not taken to the same extent as found with that needed to support insurance decisions. However, some attempts to provide this type of information have been made. An example is the collection of estimates for household components provided by the Old House Web which gathers data from the Appliance Statistical Review and various institutes involved with the homebuilding trade.

Some Engine manufacturers, such as for example Navistar and Volvo, use a so-called B-life rating,
based on the durability data of the engine manufacturer, B10 and B50 index for measuring the life expectancy of an engine.

When exposed to high temperatures, the lithium-ion batteries in smartphones are easily damaged and can fail faster than expected, in addition to letting the device run out of battery too often. Debris and other contaminants that enter through small cracks in the phone can also infringe on smartphone life expectancy. One of the most common factors that cause smartphones and other electronic devices to die quickly is physical impact and breakage, which can severely damage the internal pieces.

== Operational life ==
For certain products, such as those that cannot be serviced during their operational life for technical reasons, a manufacturer may calculate a product&#x27;s expected performance at both the beginning of operational life (BOL) and end of operational life (EOL). Batteries and other components that degrade over time may affect the operation of a product. The performance of mission critical components is therefore calculated for EOL, with the components exceeding their specification at BOL. For example, with spaceflight hardware, which must survive in the harsh environment of space, the capacity to generate electricity from solar panels or radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) is likely to reduce throughout a mission, but must still meet a specific requirement at EOL in order to complete the mission. A spacecraft may also have a BOL mass that is greater than its EOL mass as propellant is depleted during its operational life.

<text>Romancing the Stone is a 1984 romantic comedy-adventure film directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by Diane Thomas and produced by Michael Douglas, who also stars in the film alongside Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito. The film follows a romance novelist who must venture beyond her New York City comfort zone to Colombia in order to save her widowed sister from criminals who are holding her for ransom.

Thomas wrote the screenplay in 1979. Zemeckis, who at the time was developing &quot;Cocoon&quot;, liked Thomas&#x27;s screenplay and offered to direct but 20th Century Fox initially declined, citing the commercial failure of his first two films &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;Used Cars&quot;. Zemeckis was eventually dismissed from &quot;Cocoon&quot; after an early screening of &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; failed to further impress studio executives. Alan Silvestri, who would collaborate with Zemeckis on his later films, composed the score.

&quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; was released on March 30, 1984, to positive reviews from critics and earned over $115 million worldwide at the box office. A sequel, &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot;, was released one year and nine months later on December 11, 1985.

==Plot==
Joan Wilder is a successful, but lonely, romance novelist living in New York City with her cat, Romeo. After finishing her latest novel, Joan leaves her apartment to meet her editor and friend, Gloria Horne. On the way she is handed a letter by her neighbor, Mrs. Irwin, that contains a map, sent by her recently murdered brother-in-law, Eduardo. While she is gone, a man tries to break into her apartment and is discovered by her apartment building&#x27;s superintendent, whom he kills. Returning to her apartment, Joan finds it ransacked. She then receives a frantic phone call from her sister Elaine, Eduardo&#x27;s widow. Elaine has been kidnapped by antiquities smugglers, cousins Ira and Ralph, and instructs Joan to go to the Colombian coastal city of Cartagena with the map she received; it is Elaine&#x27;s ransom.

Flying to Colombia, Joan is diverted from the rendezvous point by Colonel Zolo—the same man who ransacked her apartment looking for the map—by tricking her into boarding the wrong bus. Instead of heading to Cartagena, this bus goes deep into the interior of the country. Ralph realizes this and begins following Joan. After Joan accidentally distracts the bus driver by asking where they are going, the bus crashes into a Land Rover, wrecking both vehicles. As the rest of the passengers walk away, Joan is menaced by Zolo but is saved by the Land Rover&#x27;s owner, an American exotic bird smuggler named Jack T. Colton. For getting her out of the jungle and to a telephone, Joan promises to pay Jack $375 in traveler&#x27;s cheques.

Jack and Joan travel the jungle while eluding Zolo and his military police. Reaching a small village, they encounter a drug lord named Juan who is a big fan of Joan&#x27;s novels and happily helps them escape from Zolo.

After a night of dancing and passion in a nearby town, Jack suggests to Joan that they find the treasure themselves before handing over the map. Zolo&#x27;s men enter the town, so Jack and Joan steal a car to escape—but it is Ralph&#x27;s car, and he is sleeping in the back. They follow the clues and retrieve the treasure, an enormous emerald called &quot;El Corazón&quot; (&quot;The Heart&quot;). Ralph takes the emerald from them at gunpoint, but Zolo&#x27;s forces appear, distracting Ralph long enough for Jack to steal the jewel back. After being chased into a river and over a waterfall, Jack and Joan are separated on opposite sides of the raging river; Joan has the map, but Jack has the emerald. Jack directs Joan to Cartagena, promising that he will meet her there.

In Cartagena, Joan meets with Ira, who takes the map and releases Elaine. But Zolo and his men arrive, with a captured Jack and a severely beaten Ralph. As Zolo tortures Joan, Jack tries to kick the emerald into a crocodile pool behind Zolo. Zolo is able to catch the emerald, but then a crocodile jumps up and bites his hand off, swallowing the emerald with it. A shootout ensues between Zolo&#x27;s soldiers and Ira&#x27;s gang. Joan and Elaine dash for safety, pursued by the maimed Zolo, as Jack tries to stop the crocodile from escaping. He begrudgingly releases it, to instead try to save Joan.

A crazed Zolo charges at Joan; she dodges his wild knife slashes and he falls into a crocodile pit. As the authorities arrive, Ira and his men escape, but Ralph is left behind. After a kiss, Jack dives into the water after the crocodile with the emerald, leaving Joan behind with her sister.

Some time later, Joan is back in New York City and has written a new novel based on her adventure. Gloria—Joan&#x27;s publisher—is moved to tears by the story and tells Joan she has another best-seller on her hands. Returning home, she finds Jack waiting for her in a sailboat named the &quot;Angelina&quot;, after the heroine of Joan&#x27;s novels, and wearing boots made from the crocodile&#x27;s skin. He jokes that the crocodile got &quot;a fatal case of indigestion&quot; from the emerald, which he sold, using the money to buy the boat of his dreams. They go off together, planning to sail around the world.

==Production==
===Screenplay===
The screenplay was written five years earlier by Malibu waitress Diane Thomas in what would end up being her only screenplay made into a movie. She died in a car crash a year and a half after the film&#x27;s release.

===Casting===
Sylvester Stallone was originally considered for the role of Jack T. Colton. Other leads considered include Burt Reynolds, Clint Eastwood, Paul Newman, and Christopher Reeve for the part of Jack Colton before Douglas hired himself and Debra Winger was the studio&#x27;s top choice for Joan Wilder.

===Filming===
Filming locations included Veracruz, Mexico (Fort of San Juan de Ulúa), Huasca de Ocampo, Mexico, and Snow Canyon, Utah. The scene where Turner and Douglas get separated on opposite banks on a whitewater river was filmed on the Rio Antigua near the town of Jalcomulco, Veracruz.

Turner later said of the film&#x27;s production, &quot;I remember terrible arguments [with Robert Zemeckis] doing &quot;Romancing&quot;. He&#x27;s a film-school grad, fascinated by cameras and effects. I never felt that he knew what I was having to do to adjust my acting to some of his damn cameras – sometimes he puts you in ridiculous postures. I&#x27;d say, &#x27;This is not helping me! This is not the way I like to work, thank you! Zemeckis would go on to work with Turner again, casting her as the voice of Jessica Rabbit in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Studio insiders expected &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; to flop to the point that, after viewing a rough cut of the film, the producers of the then-under-development &quot;Cocoon&quot; fired Zemeckis as director of that film. However, it became a surprise hit and 20th Century Fox&#x27;s only big hit of 1984. The film eventually grossed over US$115 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1984. Zemeckis later stated that the success of &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; allowed him to make &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985).

===Critical response===

Upon the release of &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the film &quot;a distaff &quot;Raiders&quot; rip-off&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; remarked that &quot;Though fitfully thrilling and amusing, [Joan Wilder&#x27;s] adventures degenerate into a muddle. Neither screenwriter Diane Thomas nor director Robert Zemeckis, good-humored as they strive to be, maintains a coherent perception of how the plot should be contrived to trump the heroine&#x27;s overactive fantasy life.&quot; They elaborated that the stone makes an uncompelling MacGuffin, Joan&#x27;s character development is incongruous and ultimately unsatisfying, and Joan and Jack lack romantic chemistry. By contrast, &quot;Time Out&quot; commented that &quot;The script is sharp and funny, the direction sure-footed on both the comedy and action fronts&quot;, and compared the film favorably to its contemporary in the same genre, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984). Roger Ebert called it &quot;a silly, high-spirited chase picture&quot;, saying he greatly enjoyed the film&#x27;s imaginative perils, colorful cast of villains, and believable relationship between its two lead characters. He likewise compared it favorably to other &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; clones.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Good-humoured, sparky stuff in the manner of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.&quot;

Filmsite.org included it as one of the best films of 1984, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included it on its list of films that made 1984 one of the best years for Hollywood films.

Then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan viewed the film at Camp David in May 1984.

===Awards===
Award wins:
* Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy
* Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy – Kathleen Turner
* Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress – Kathleen Turner
* Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing – ADR

Award nominations:
* Academy Award for Best Film Editing – Donn Cambern, Frank Morriss
* American Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Feature Film – Donn Cambern, Frank Morriss
* Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay – Diane Thomas

==In other media==
===Books===
The novelization of &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; was credited to Joan Wilder, although (along with a novelization of the sequel movie, &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot;) it was actually written by Catherine Lanigan.

==Sequels==
The success of &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; led to a sequel, &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot;, without Zemeckis directing but with Douglas, Turner, and DeVito all returning. The film was released in December 1985 and was commercially successful, but received weaker reviews than the first film.

Since 1985, numerous attempts have been made to produce further sequels to the film. Another sequel, called &quot;The Crimson Eagle&quot;, would have had Jack and Joan take their two teenage children to Thailand where they are blackmailed into stealing a priceless statue. Filming was scheduled to begin in 1987, following Michael Douglas&#x27;s shooting of &quot;Wall Street&quot;, but the production was delayed and ultimately never made it past the development stage. DeVito reunited Douglas, Turner, and himself in his 1989 film &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;.

In 2005 and again in 2008, Douglas was developing a second sequel, tentatively titled &quot;Racing the Monsoon&quot;.

Since 2007, 20th Century Fox has considered producing a remake of &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, with the possibility of a reboot series. The roles of Jack Colton and Joan Wilder would be filled by Taylor Kitsch (or Gerard Butler) and Katherine Heigl, respectively. By 2011, the remake was re-worked as a television series.

<text>The Rocky Flats Plant was a United States manufacturing complex that produced nuclear weapons parts near Denver, Colorado. The facility&#x27;s primary mission was the fabrication of plutonium pits, the fissionable part of a bomb that produces a nuclear explosion. The pits were shipped to other facilities to be assembled into complete nuclear weapons. Operated from 1952 to 1992 by private contractors, Dow Chemical Company, Rockwell International Corporation and EG&amp;G, the complex was under the control of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), succeeded by the Department of Energy (DOE) in 1977. The plant manufactured 1,000 to 2,000 pits per year.

Plutonium pit production was halted in 1989 after EPA and FBI agents raided the facility and the plant was formally shut down in 1992. Rockwell then accepted a plea agreement for criminal violations of environmental law. At the time, the fine was one of the largest penalties ever in an environmental law case.

Cleanup began in the early 1990s, and the site achieved regulatory closure in 2006. The cleanup effort decommissioned and demolished the entire plant, more than 800 structures; removed over 21 tons of weapons-grade material; removed over 1.3 million cubic meters of waste; and treated more than of water. Four groundwater treatment systems were also constructed. The site of the former facility consists of two distinct areas: the &quot;Central Operable Unit&quot;, which remains off-limits to the public as a CERCLA Superfund site, owned and managed by the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Every five years, the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment review environmental data and other information to assess whether the remedy is functioning as intended. The latest Five-Year Review for the site, released in August 2022, concluded the site remedy is protective of human health and the environment. However, a protectiveness deferred determination was made for PFAS.

==History==

===1950s===
Following World War II, the United States increased production of nuclear weapons. A site about northwest of Denver on a windy plateau called Rocky Flats was chosen for the facility. Contemporary news reports stated that the site would not be used to produce nuclear bombs, but might be used to produce uranium and plutonium components for use in nuclear weapons.

The construction of Rocky Flats began in July 1951 and was a significant boon to the Colorado economy. Colorado state highways 72 and 93 were constructed to access the plant. Direct government construction contracts to Colorado business were worth $26 million and employed 2,800 people.

By April 1953, the plant began operating under Dow Chemical company. What the plant made, when construction was finished, when it began making its products, and how much product it was making was secret. Routine production processes began immediately leaking plutonium into the atmosphere. A later study on the risks to public health from Rocky Flats estimated that normal operations leaked up to 130,000 microcuries of plutonium annually into the atmosphere as part of its production processes during the 1950s. This routine leakage declined in the 1960s and continued down to 60 picocuries in 1989. For residents living in the area most contaminated by Rocky Flats, this is a comparable exposure to the plutonium from fallout of nuclear weapons testing. This does not include the much higher levels of exposure as a result of the later fires. 

Rocky Flats was established next to Walnut and Woman creek. Until the construction of a waste treatment facility in 1957, plutonium contaminated wastewater was discharged directly into Walnut creek which followed to Broomfield&#x27;s drinking water supply. In 1953, a retention pond was built along Walnut creek which accumulated plutonium in its soil. In addition to plutonium contamination the pond absorbed chemicals used in the production process such as algicides and chromates. 

The AEC called Rocky Flats a &quot;Weapon Production Facility&quot; in a 1956 report. At this time, the plant was expanded with an additional $18.4 million investment from the AEC.

In June 1957 two employees were taken to the onsite hospital after an explosion in the production line. They were treated for cuts from flying glass and exposure to plutonium. 

On September 11, 1957, a plutonium fire occurred in one of the gloveboxes used to handle radioactive materials, igniting the combustible rubber gloves and plexiglas windows of the box. Metallic plutonium is a fire hazard and pyrophoric; under the right conditions it may ignite in air at room temperature. The fire escaped containment in under thirty minutes and the firefighters were forced to use water, a risky decision on plutonium fire, to put out the fire in the glovebox. After putting out the original source, there was an explosion in the ventilation system. The fire burned the filters that normally removed the plutonium from the building&#x27;s air resulting in the release of 21 curies of plutonium into the atmosphere. For comparison the Fat Man, used 448 curies of plutonium for its core. The accident resulted in the contamination of Building 771 and caused $818,600 in damage. At the time, the AEC spokesman significantly downplayed the risk of plutonium exposure and estimated only $50,000 in damages.

An incinerator for plutonium-contaminated waste was installed in Building 771 in 1958. The offgas was treated with scrubbers and filters and eventually released to the atmosphere. The ash was occasionally able to be reprocessed for plutonium recovery.


===1960s===

In 1960, one of the workers who responded to the 1957 fire petitioned the state legislature to create a way for workers that receive unsafe doses of radiation on the job to be compensated for the health effects. Smaller incidents, such as a 1962 fire, continued to threaten the safety of the workers without posing a significant public health risk.

Throughout the 1960s, the plant continued to enlarge and add buildings. The AEC sponsored $4.5 million in new construction contracts at Rocky Flats for 1960 and $3 million in 1962 . Payroll reached $26 million annually by 1962. 
The 1960s also brought more contamination to the site. By 1967, of plutonium-contaminated lubricants and solvents had accumulated on Pad 903. A large number of them were found to be leaking, and low-level contaminated soil was becoming wind-borne from this area. At least some of the leakage had been detected as early as 1962. From 1954-1970, radioactive waste, including the barrels, was moved to Idaho National Laboratory. After removing the barrels, it was discovered that the winds, which frequently exceeded 100mph, had moved plutonium contaminated soil off the 903 Area. It was then paved over with asphalt in 1969 to prevent further spread of the contaminated soil. Later analysis completed in 1999 for the CDPHE estimated that between 6 and 58 curies of plutonium spilled on to Pad 903 soil due to barrel leakage. 

In 1965, there were at least 24 fires at the plant. In the worst of these, 400 employees were exposed to airborne plutonium. Twenty-five workers received over seventeen times the federal limit for plutonium exposure.

In 1968, Dow Chemical covered up leaks of tritium through the plant&#x27;s smokestack. They choose not install an alarm system to notify the plant of on going leakage of radioactive material. In 1972 the AEC disclosed information about these leaks to the public. However, the details as to why there was tritium at Rocky Flats in the first place were classified and remained classified at least through 1992. 

==== Mother&#x27;s Day 1969 Fire====

On May 11, 1969, there was a major fire in a glovebox in Building 776/777. Later investigations disagree on what caused the fire and what time it began. The 1999 report for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said the fire was started around 2pm by a pressed plutonium block which spontaneously ignited. This agrees with some contemporary accounts and the AEC&#x27;s position. Other fire investigators said the fire was started around 10am by plutonium-contaminated oil rags, and the AEC buried that information to protect individuals from liability. Given the fire crew&#x27;s experience with the 1957 fire, the fire captain again determined to use water to put out the fire. After six hours the fire was extinguished. The AEC commended the heroism of the firefighters. As in the 1957 fire, the air filters which normally removed plutonium from the building&#x27;s exhaust were destroyed by the fire, and in this case between 10 and 60 mCi of plutonium was released.

This was likely the costliest industrial accident to occur in the United States up to that time. Approximately $20 million of plutonium was consumed in the fire and there were $50 million of other damages. Congress granted $45 million of the funding for the repairs in an emergency, closed door session at the AEC&#x27;s request. Cleanup from the accident took two years. Much of the plutonium was recovered during the cleanup.

The U.S. congress ordered an investigation into the accident, which found government officials helped cover up details of the fire by abusing classified information protocols. National Center for Atmospheric Research scientists stated that plant officials also mislead the public in press statements about the size and damage from the fire. Dow Chemical employees falsely claimed that their air filtration systems continued to work during the fire and no plutonium was released into the atmosphere. The investigation also found that the AEC ignored safety recommendations after the 1957 fire which may have prevented this accident. The investigation recommended extensive improvements to the building to increase safety. AEC officials such as Major General Giller and Chairman Seaborg publicly emphasized the need to keep Rocky Flats running and not allow the damage from the fire to delay the Safeguard Program. Senator Robert Byrd highlighted the interdependence of the AEC sites such as Los Alamos, Hanford, and Rocky Flats. Only at the end of the 1400 page congressional testimony did the government recognize that the fire had halted all US nuclear weapons production capability. Leo Goodman, a consultant for the United Auto Workers, criticized Seaborg&#x27;s leadership of the AEC because Seaborg owned the patent on the discovery of plutonium and was profiting off the AEC&#x27;s plutonium production.

===1970s===
In 1970, some members of the public with scientific backgrounds formed the Colorado Committee for Environmental Information to seek information about the public health impact of Rocky Flats. They encouraged the AEC to relocate the plant, but the AEC rejected the idea on the basis that the cost of at least $500 million was unacceptable.

Throughout 1969, Dow Chemical refused to cooperate with outside investigations into plutonium contamination in the soil around Rocky Flats. Several independent investigations brought their findings of plutonium contamination in the soil to the AEC, and the AEC refused to discuss the matters. Dow maintained that there was no public health risk from Rocky Flats operation but conceded that they could not say if there was one in the past. Furthermore, they admitted that the plant was averaging five fires a year. Nearly all of which were unreported to the public. The investigations into the 1969 fire resulted in Major General Giller, head of the AEC weapons department, reversing AEC policy by ordering his staff to cooperate with public health officials. 

The Colorado Department of Health announced their surprise when they learned, only after Giller&#x27;s new policy, that Rocky Flats was burying radioactive waste in violation of state law. As an AEC supplier, Rocky Flat&#x27;s was expect from these laws. In 1971, some officials from the state health department were granted access to the Rocky Flats Plants and determined that there was not a risk to public health at that time, but there could be one if proper precautions were not taken.

In 1971, James Hanes replaced Lloyd Joshel as the general manager at Rocky Flats. Under his tenure, accidents which endangered employees continued to occur.

In 1972, Giller announced the AEC&#x27;s $130 million investment for remodeling of the Rocky Flats Plant primarily to improve safety systems. Fire sprinkler systems and firewalls were built during the reconstruction. 

In order to reduce the danger of public contamination and to create a security area around the plant following protests, the United States Congress authorized $6 million for the purchase of a buffer zone around the plant in 1972.

From 1971 to 1973, the retention ponds along Walnut creek, which had accumulated plutonium and other toxins from the plant&#x27;s wastewater, were reconstructed. This resulted in a significant increase in Walnut creek&#x27;s plutonium concentration.

In 1973, nearby Walnut Creek (Colorado) and the Great Western Reservoir were found to have elevated tritium and strontium levels. Discovery of the contamination by the Colorado Department of Health led to investigations by the AEC and United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The AEC investigation stated that the tritium originated at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and 500-2000 curries were accidentally shipped to Rocky Flats in contaminated plutonium. Their internal investigation also stated this was not the first time tritium was accidentally shipped to Rocky Flats but that it had not been previously discovered because prior shipments contained 29-57 curries. State officials reported that it was unlikely the tritium posed a risk to public health, but Dow Chemical filed worker&#x27;s compensation claims for at least ten of their employees exposed to tritium. As a result of the investigation, several mitigation efforts were put in place to prevent further contamination. In 1977, a reverse osmosis facility was added to Rocky Flats to clean up wastewater.

In 1974, elevated plutonium levels were found in the topsoil near the now covered Pad 903. A multi-state citizen&#x27;s group sued the AEC to give the EPA permission to measure radioactive hazards from the AEC&#x27;s sites.

When the AEC opened the Rocky Flats contract for public bidding, in 1973, Dow Chemical decided not to submit a bid to extend their contract. In 1975, Rockwell International replaced Dow Chemical as the contractor for the site. This year also saw local landowners suing for property contamination caused by the plant.

In 1978, 60 protesters belonging to the Rocky Flats Truth Force, or Satyagraha Affinity Group, based in Boulder, Colorado, were arrested for trespassing at Rocky Flats, and were brought to trial before Judge Kim Goldberger. Dr. John Candler Cobb, Professor of Preventive Medicine at the University of Colorado Medical Center, testified that the most significant danger of radioactive contamination came from the 1967 incident in which oil barrels containing plutonium leaked of oil into sand under the barrels, which was then blown by strong winds as far away as Denver.

Dr. Carl Johnson, Jefferson County health director from 1973 to 1981, directed numerous studies on contamination levels and health risks the plant posed to public health. Based on his conclusions, Johnson opposed housing development near Rocky Flats. He was fired for opposing home development in contaminated areas. He later won a whistleblower lawsuit against Jefferson County, Colorado . Kristen Iversen, author of &quot;Full Body Burden: Growing Up in the Nuclear Shadow of Rocky Flats&quot;, contends later studies confirmed many of his findings.

In 1985, after hearing from various experts, the U.S. District Court for the District Court of Colorado found the results of Dr. Carl Johnson&#x27;s study were &quot;unreliable because the reported relationship seems implausible given the latency period for the types of cancer reported and because the excess cancers are different from the types of cancers expected to result from internally deposited plutonium.&quot; In addition, the court agreed with the Colorado State epidemiologist that &quot;no measurable increases in cancer incidence resulting from operations at Rocky Flats have been demonstrated by any appropriate scientific method.&quot; Subsequent and ongoing studies indicate likely ongoing contamination and health issues. To date, there has never been an epidemiological study of people who lived or live near the Rocky Flats site.

On April 28, 1979, a few weeks after the Three Mile Island accident, a crowd of close to 15,000 protesters assembled at a nearby site. Singers Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt took the stage along with various speakers. The following day, 286 protesters including Daniel Ellsberg were arrested for civil disobedience/trespassing on the Rocky Flats facility.

===1980s===
On December 11, 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, which provided the authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases at the nation&#x27;s worst environmental sites.

&quot;Dark Circle&quot; is a 1982 American documentary film that focuses on the Rocky Flats Plant and its plutonium contamination of the area&#x27;s environment. The film won the Grand Prize for documentary at the Sundance Film Festival and received a national Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding individual achievement in news and documentary&quot;.

Rocky Flats became a focus of protest by peace activists throughout the 1980s. In 1983, a demonstration was organized that brought together 17,000 people who joined hands in an encirclement around the perimeter of the plant.

A perimeter security zone was installed around the facility in 1983 and was upgraded with remote detection abilities in 1985. Also in 1983, the first radioactive waste was processed through the aqueous recovery system, creating a plutonium button.

A plant safety official, Jim Stone, warned Rockwell that their employees were being exposed to unsafe levels of beryllium in 1984. He was fired in 1986 for whistle blowing. The plant used beryllium as part of the weapons manufacturing process. Stone later claimed that Rockwell would fire employees who had been exposed in order to limit their liability for the health of their employees. Twelve Rocky Flats workers were discovered to have berylliosis, a lung disease cause by beryllium, as part of DOE testing. These findings spurred the DOE to investigate berylliosis in all their facilities.

A celebration of 250,000 continuous safe hours by the employees at Rocky Flats happened in 1985. The same year, Rockwell received Industrial Research Magazine&#x27;s IR-100 award for a process to remove actinide contamination from wastewater at the plant. The next year, the site received a National Safety Council Award of Honor for outstanding safety performance.

By 1986 over 5,500 workers were employed at the site, and were represented by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union (OCAW).

In 1986, the State of Colorado&#x27;s Public Health Department, EPA, and DOE entered into a compliance agreement with the goal of bringing the facility into compliance with RCRA and Colorado Hazardous Waste Act permitting, generator, and waste management requirements. The agreement also initiated a process for investigating and remediating environmental contamination. In addition, the agreement established a framework addressing DOE&#x27;s mixed-waste.

On August 10, 1987, 320 demonstrators were arrested after they tried to force a one-day shutdown of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant.

In 1988, a Department of Energy (DOE) safety evaluation resulted in a report that was critical of safety measures at the plant. The EPA fined the plant for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) leaks from a transformer. A solid waste form, called pondcrete, was found not to have cured properly and was leaking from containers. A boxcar of transuranic waste from the site was refused entry into Idaho and returned to the plant. Plans to potentially close the plant were released.

In 1989 an employee left a faucet running, resulting in chromic acid being released into the sanitary water system. The Colorado Department of Health and the EPA both posted full-time personnel at the plant to monitor safety. Plutonium production was suspended due to safety violations.

In August 1989, an estimated 3,500 people turned out for a demonstration at Rocky Flats.

====FBI/EPA investigation, June 1989 raid====
In 1987, plant insiders started to covertly inform the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about the unsafe conditions. In December 1988, the FBI commenced clandestine flights of light aircraft over the area and confirmed via infrared video recordings that the &quot;outdated and unpermitted&quot; Building 771 incinerator was apparently being used late into the night. After several months of collecting evidence both from workers and via direct measurement in 1989, the FBI informed the DOE on June 6 that they wanted to meet to discuss a potential terrorist threat.

On June 6, 1989, the United States District Court for the District Court of Colorado issued a search warrant to the FBI, based in part on information collected by Colorado Department of Health (now CDPHE) inspectors during the 1980s. Dubbed &quot;Operation Desert Glow&quot;, the raid, sponsored by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), began at 9 a.m. on June 6. After arriving in the meeting room, the FBI agents revealed the true reason for the meeting to stunned DOE and Rockwell officials, including Dominic Sanchini, Rockwell International&#x27;s manager of Rocky Flats, who died the next year in Boulder of cancer. The FBI discovered numerous violations of federal anti-pollution laws, including limited contamination of water and soil. In 1992, Rockwell International was charged with environmental crimes, including violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Clean Water Act. Rockwell pleaded guilty and paid an $18.5 million fine. This was the largest fine for an environmental crime to that date.

After the FBI raid, federal authorities used the subsequent grand jury investigation to gather evidence of wrongdoing and then sealed the record. In October 2006, DOE announced completion of the Rocky Flats cleanup without this information being available.

The FBI raid led to the formation of Colorado&#x27;s first special grand jury in 1989, the juried testimony of 110 witnesses, reviews of 2,000 exhibits, and ultimately a 1992 plea agreement in which Rockwell admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines out of its own funds. This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by the Government Accounting Office (GAO), and yet was also by far the highest hazardous-waste fine ever; four times larger than the previous record. Due to indemnification of nuclear contractors, without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and Rockwell, the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers. Criminal penalties allotted to Rockwell would likely also not have been covered because the Department of Energy had specifically exempted them from most environmental laws including hazardous waste.

Regardless, and as forewarned by the prosecuting U.S. Attorney, Ken Fimberg/Scott, the Department of Justice&#x27;s stated findings and plea agreement with Rockwell were heavily contested by its own, 23-member special grand jury. Press leaks on both sides—members of the DOJ and the grand jury—occurred in violation of secrecy regarding grand jury information, a federal crime punishable by a prison sentence. The public contest led to U.S. Congressional oversight committee hearings chaired by Congressman Howard Wolpe, which issued subpoenas to DOJ principals despite several instances of DOJ&#x27;s refusal to comply. The hearings, whose findings include that the Justice Department had &quot;bargained away the truth&quot;, ultimately still did not fully reveal to the public the special grand jury&#x27;s report, which remains sealed by the DOJ courts.

The special grand jury report was nonetheless leaked to &quot;Westword&quot;. According to its subsequent publications, the Rocky Flats special grand jury had compiled indictments charging three DOE officials and five Rockwell employees with environmental crimes. The grand jury also wrote a report, intended for the public&#x27;s consumption per their charter, lambasting the conduct of DOE and Rocky Flats contractors for &quot;engaging in a continuing campaign of distraction, deception and dishonesty&quot; and noted that Rocky Flats, for many years, had discharged pollutants, hazardous materials and radioactive matter into nearby creeks and Broomfield&#x27;s and Westminster&#x27;s water supplies.

The DOE itself, in a study released in December of the year prior to the FBI raid, had called Rocky Flats&#x27; ground water the single greatest environmental hazard at any of its nuclear facilities.

====Sealed grand jury records====
Court records from the grand jury proceeding on Rocky Flats have been sealed for a number of years. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which govern federal grand jury proceedings, explicitly require grand jury proceedings to be kept secret unless otherwise provided by the Rules. Rocky Flats&#x27; secret grand jury proceedings were not unique.

However, some activists dispute the reasons for records confidentiality: Dr. LeRoy Moore, a Boulder theologian and peace activist; retired FBI Special Agent Jon Lipsky, who led the FBI&#x27;s raid of the Rocky Flats plant to investigate illegal plutonium burning and other environmental crimes; and Wes McKinley, who was the foreman of the grand jury investigation into the operations at Rocky Flats (and served several terms as Colorado State Representative).

Former grand jury foreman McKinley chronicles his experiences in the 2004 book he co-authored with attorney Caron Balkany, &quot;The Ambushed Grand Jury&quot;, which begins with an open letter to the U.S. Congress from Special Agent Lipsky:

However, a former EPA employee and Jon Lipsky&#x27;s partner disputes these claims: &quot;Jon kind of went off the deep end,&quot; and &quot;He started seeing conspiracy theories in everything.&quot;

===1990s===
Rockwell International was replaced by EG&amp;G as primary contractor for the Rocky Flats plant. EG&amp;G began an aggressive work safety and cleanup plan for the site that included construction of a system to remove contamination from the groundwater of the site. The &quot;Sierra Club vs. Rockwell&quot; case was decided in favor of the Sierra Club. The ruling directed Rocky Flats to manage plutonium residues as hazardous waste.

In 1991, an interagency agreement between DOE, the Colorado Department of Health, and the EPA outlined multiyear schedules for environmental restoration studies and remediation activities. DOE released a report that advocated downsizing the plant&#x27;s production into a more streamlined facility. Due to the fall of the Soviet Union, production of most of the systems at Rocky Flats was no longer needed, leaving only the W88 warhead primary stages.

In 1992, due to an order by President G. H. W. Bush, production of submarine-based missiles using the W88 trigger was discontinued, leading to the layoff of 4,500 employees at the plant; 4,000 others were retained for long-term cleanup of the facility. The Rocky Flats Plant Transition Plan outlined the environmental restoration process. The DOE announced that of plutonium lined the exhaust ductwork in six buildings on the site.

Starting in 1993, weapons-grade plutonium began to be shipped to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Savannah River Site.

In 1994 the site was renamed the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, reflecting the changed nature of the site from weapon production to environmental cleanup and restoration. The cleanup effort was contracted to the Kaiser-Hill Company, which proposed the release of of the buffer zone for public access.

In 1998, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&#x27;s Cancer Registry conducted an independent study of cancer rates in areas around the Rocky Flats Site. Data showed no pattern of increased cancers tied to Rocky Flats.

Throughout the remainder of the 1990s and into the 2000s, cleanup of contaminated sites and dismantling of contaminated buildings continued with the waste materials being shipped to the Nevada Test Site, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, and the Envirocare company facility in Utah, which is now EnergySolutions.

===2000s===
In 2001, Congress passed the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act. In July 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy transferred nearly of land on the Rocky Flats site to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to establish the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. Surveys of the site reveal 630 species of vascular plants, 76% of which are native. Herds of elk are commonly seen on the site. However, the DOE retained the central area of the site, the Central Operable Unit.

The last contaminated building was removed and the last weapons-grade plutonium was shipped out in 2003, ending the cleanup based on a modified cleanup agreement. The modified agreement required a higher level of cleanup in the first of soil in exchange for not having to remove any contamination below that point unless it posed a chance of migrating to the surface or contaminating the groundwater. About half of the 800 buildings previously existing on the site had been dismantled by early December 2004. By 2006, over 800 buildings had been decommissioned and demolished, with no buildings remaining. Today, the plant and all buildings are gone.

The site is contaminated with residual plutonium due to several industrial fires that occurred on the site and other inadvertent releases caused by wind at a waste storage area. The other major contaminant is carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Both of these substances affected areas adjacent to the site. In addition, there were small releases of beryllium and tritium, as well as dioxin from incineration.

Cleanup was declared complete on October 13, 2005. About of the original site, the former industrial area, remains under U.S. DOE Office of Legacy Management control for ongoing environmental monitoring and remediation. On March 14, 2007, DOE, EPA, and CDPHE entered into the Rocky Flats Legacy Management Agreement (RFLMA). The agreement establishes the regulatory framework for implementing the final remedy for the Rocky Flats site and ensuring the protection of human health and the environment.

In 2007, because the Peripheral Operable Unit was found to be suitable for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, EPA posted public notice of its intent to delete this area (now largely the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge) from the EPA&#x27;s National Priorities List of CERCLA or &quot;Superfund&quot; sites. The Peripheral Operable Unit was subsequently removed from the National Priorities List.

===2010s===
In September 2010, after a 20-year legal battle, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a $926 million award in a class-action lawsuit against Dow Chemical and Rockwell International. The three-judge panel said that the jury reached its decision on faulty instructions that incorrectly stated the law. The appeals court tossed the jury verdict and sent the case back to the District Court. According to the Appellate Court, the owners of 12,000 properties in the class-action area had not proved their properties were damaged or that they suffered bodily injury from plutonium that blew onto their properties.

In response to historic and ongoing reports of health issues by people who live and lived near Rocky Flats, an online health survey was launched in May 2016 by Metropolitan State University, Rocky Flats Downwinders, and other local universities and health agencies to survey thousands of Coloradans who lived east of the Rocky Flats plant while it was operational.

On May 19, 2016, a $375 million settlement was reached over claims by more than 15,000 nearby homeowners that plutonium releases from the plant risked their health and devalued their property. This settlement ended a 26-year legal battle between residents and the two corporations that ran the Rocky Flats Plant, Dow Chemical and Rockwell International, for the Department of Energy.

June 2014 marked a quarter century since the historic FBI and EPA raid of the Rocky Flats plant. A 3-day weekend of events from Friday, June 6 through Sunday, June 8 took place at the Arvada Center for the Arts, &quot;Rocky Flats Then and Now: 25 Years After the Raid&quot;. Panel discussions covered various aspects of the Rocky Flats raid and its aftermath. On display were historical photographs and artifacts, as well as Rocky Flats-inspired art.

In 2016, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&#x27;s Cancer Registry completed a cancer incidence study that looked at the incidence of reported cancers in areas around Rocky Flats from 1990 to 2014. This study followed-up on and was modeled after CDPHE&#x27;s original Rocky Flats cancer incidence study, which was completed in 1998. Ten cancers specifically linked to plutonium exposure and other cancers of concern to a Health Advisory Panel were assessed in 1998, and again in 2016. The study found &quot;the incidence of all cancers-combined for both adults and children was no different in the communities surrounding Rocky Flats than would be expected based on cancer rates in the remainder of the Denver Metro area for 1990 to 2014.&quot;

In 2017, the CDPHE Cancer Registry completed a supplement to this study that specifically looked at the incidence of thyroid and rare cancers in neighborhoods around Rocky Flats. Cancer incidence data showed &quot;no evidence of higher than expected frequencies of thyroid cancer&quot; and &quot;the incidence of &#x27;rare&#x27; cancer was not higher than expected compared to the remainder of the Denver Metro area.&quot;

In 2018, Metropolitan State University of Denver declined to further participate in the Downwinders&#x27; health survey.

In January 2019, activist groups questioning the contamination risk assessment for the wildlife refuge filed a lawsuit to unseal documents from the grand jury investigation.

In response to concerned citizens reports about a breast cancer cluster in young women, CDPHE&#x27;s Central Cancer Registry also examined the incidence of breast cancer in young women in communities around Rocky Flats. The Cancer Registry maintains a statewide database of all cancers diagnosed in Colorado residents (with some skin cancer exceptions). Hospitals, physicians, and laboratories are required by law to report medically confirmed cancer data to CDPHE. In October 2019, CDPHE shared the Cancer Registry&#x27;s findings. The Cancer Registry concluded, based on an analysis of the data, that &quot;no increased incidence of breast cancer was found in young women in communities around Rocky Flats.&quot;

Rocky Flats was the primary source for plutonium pits in the United States. These pits were used to make the nuclear weapons. In the 1950s, the company strictly maintained that the workers would handle radioactive material but would not make nuclear weapons. This was technically true because the pits were used at the Pantex plant in Amarillo, Texas to assemble fission weapons and the primary stages of thermonuclear weapons. During its lifetime, the plant manufactured 1,000 to 2,000 pits per year. Rocky Flats became the primary plutonium pit production site in the United States. Los Alamos National Laboratory would continue to be used as a pit R&amp;D facility from 1949 to 2013. The Hanford Site also produced plutonium pits from 1949 to 1965.

In addition to other products, the plant produced parts of the warheads for the LGM-30 Minuteman, UGM-73 Poseidon, Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle, and LIM-49 Spartan programs. It also disassembled decommissioned warheads to recover the plutonium.

== Labor ==

The labor movement and unions played a significant role in the development and operation of Rocky Flats. From the beginning construction was performed with a semi-unionized work force. A walkout halted construction in 1952. By 1958 there were at least 900 unionized workers at the plant represented by 16 different unions. Union representation grew to 1500 by 1962. 

Contract negotiations in 1962 ended after President Kennedy asked the Metal Trades Council to postpone a strike and the union agreed. The contract, involving scheduled 2.5% raises, had been proposed by federal negotiators but Dow did not accept. After the postponement, President Kennedy and Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg tried to forge an agreement between Dow and the union. However, Dow continued to push contracts allowing seven consecutive days of work which the union rejected and elected to strike.

After the 1969 fire there was significant pressure to keep production going. However, the Sheet Metal Workers Local union had a dispute with the prime contractor, Swinerton and Walbert Co, because their work creating baffles was reassigned to the carpenter&#x27;s union. This led to a small strike which escalated to the whole Sheet Metal Workers Local striking when the original strikers were fired. Swinerton and Walbert then brought a case before the National Joint Board for Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes in the Building and Construction Industry. Representatives of the unions in Washington DC went to mediation, but the Sheet Metal Workers Local rejected their resolution requiring them to return to work without the baffle manufacturing job.

Joseph Sykes, a janitor at the plant, was denied unemployment compensation in 1970 after he was fired for refusing to work in buildings 776/777 where the 1969 fire occurred. He felt that it was unsafe to work due to cancer risk, but the Colorado Industrial Commission ruled that he must demonstrate an actual hazard. Witnesses during the case testified that employees at Rocky Flats had received twelve times the federal limit for radiation and twenty times the federal limit for inhaled radiation.

By 1970, the Allied and Technical Workers of the United States and Canada represented 2,000 employees at Rocky Flats. Their wage negotiations fell through and resulted in a strike when the union demanded a 15% raise and the company would not go above 7%. Shortly afterwards, their picket line was mandated by the federal court to use no more than two pickets and twenty-four persons. This was increased a few days later to allow seven pickets and thirty-two persons. The union did not follow the order; hundreds of workers picketed and spread nails on the plant&#x27;s approach roads. The strike continued for more than eight weeks with 120 scabs. Dow filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against the union claiming they negotiated in bad faith and intimidated scabs.

In the early 1970s the AEC continued to seek additional funding from congress to upgrade Rocky Flats. Along with the new funding, the AEC recommended Dow Chemical install safety upgrades, but the company did not want to implement these systems. When their contract with United Steel Workers of America expired, in 1973, the union rejected a 7% raise because they wanted Dow to agree to follow the AEC&#x27;s safety recommendations.

<doc id="578014" wikidata="Q185375" url="?curid=578014" title="Mikhail Bakhtin">
<text>Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin (; ; – 7 March 1975) was a Russian philosopher and literary critic who worked on the philosophy of language, ethics, and literary theory. His writings, on a variety of subjects, inspired scholars working in a number of different traditions (Marxism, semiotics, structuralism, religious criticism) and in disciplines as diverse as literary criticism, history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology and psychology. Although Bakhtin was active in the debates on aesthetics and literature that took place in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, his distinctive position did not become well known until he was rediscovered by Russian scholars in the 1960s.

== Early life ==
Bakhtin was born in Oryol, Russia, to an old family of the nobility. His father was the manager of a bank and worked in several cities. For this reason Bakhtin spent his early childhood years in Oryol, in Vilnius, and then in Odessa, where in 1913 he joined the historical and philological faculty at the local university (the Odessa University). Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist write: &quot;Odessa..., like Vilnius, was an appropriate setting for a chapter in the life of a man who was to become the philosopher of heteroglossia and carnival. The same sense of fun and irreverence that gave birth to Babel&#x27;s Rabelaisian gangster or to the tricks and deceptions of Ostap Bender, the picaro created by Ilf and Petrov, left its mark on Bakhtin.&quot; He later transferred to Petrograd Imperial University to join his brother Nikolai. It is here that Bakhtin was greatly influenced by the classicist F. F. Zelinsky, whose works contain the beginnings of concepts elaborated by Bakhtin.

== Career ==
Bakhtin completed his studies in 1918. He then moved to a small city in western Russia, Nevel (Pskov Oblast), where he worked as a schoolteacher for two years. It was at that time that the first &quot;Bakhtin Circle&quot; formed. The group consisted of intellectuals with varying interests, but all shared a love for the discussion of literary, religious, and political topics. Included in this group were Valentin Voloshinov; Matvei Isaevich Kagan; Lev Vasilievich Pumpianskii; Ivan Ivanovich Sollertinskii; and, eventually, P. N. Medvedev, who joined the group later in Vitebsk. Vitebsk was &quot;a cultural centre of the region&quot; the perfect place for Bakhtin &quot;and other intellectuals [to organize] lectures, debates and concerts.&quot; German philosophy was the topic talked about most frequently and, from this point forward, Bakhtin considered himself more a philosopher than a literary scholar. It was in Nevel, also, that Bakhtin worked tirelessly on a large work concerning moral philosophy that was never published in its entirety. However, in 1919, a short section of this work was published and given the title &quot;Art and Responsibility&quot;. This piece constitutes Bakhtin&#x27;s first published work. Bakhtin relocated to Vitebsk in 1920. It was here, in 1921, that Bakhtin married Elena Aleksandrovna Okolovich. Later, in 1923, Bakhtin was diagnosed with osteomyelitis, a bone disease that ultimately led to amputation of a leg in 1938. This illness hampered his productivity and rendered him an invalid.
In 1924, Bakhtin moved to Leningrad, where he assumed a position at the Historical Institute and provided consulting services for the State Publishing House. It is at this time that Bakhtin decided to share his work with the public, but, just before &quot;On the Question of the Methodology of Aesthetics in Written Works&quot; was to be published, the journal in which it was to appear stopped publication. This work was eventually published 51 years later. Repression and misplacement of his manuscripts would plague Bakhtin throughout his career. In 1929, &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky&#x27;s Art&quot;, Bakhtin&#x27;s first major work, was published. It is here that Bakhtin introduces the concept of dialogism. However, just as this book was introduced, on 8 December 1928, right before Voskresenie&#x27;s 10th anniversary, Meyer, Bakhtin and a number of others associated with Voskresenie were apprehended by the Soviet secret police, the OGPU (Hirschkop 1999: p. 168). The leaders received sentences of up to ten years in labor camps of Solovki, though after an appeal to consider the state of his health, Bakhtin&#x27;s sentence was commuted to exile to Kazakhstan, where he and his wife spent six years in Kustanai (now Kostanay). In 1936, they moved to Saransk (then in Mordovian ASSR, now the Republic of Mordovia), where Bakhtin taught at the Mordovian Pedagogical Institute.

During the six years he spent working as a book-keeper in the town of Kustanai, he wrote several important essays, including &quot;Discourse in the Novel&quot;. In 1936, living in Saransk, he became an obscure figure in a provincial college, dropping out of view and teaching only occasionally. In 1937, Bakhtin moved to Kimry, a town located one hundred kilometers from Moscow. Here, he completed work on a book concerning the 18th-century German novel, which was subsequently accepted by the Sovetskii Pisatel&#x27; Publishing House. However, the only copy of the manuscript disappeared during the upheaval caused by the German invasion of 1941.

After the amputation of a leg in 1938, Bakhtin&#x27;s health improved and he became more prolific. In 1940, and until the end of World War II, Bakhtin lived in Moscow, where he submitted a dissertation on François Rabelais to the Gorky Institute of World Literature to obtain a postgraduate title, although the dissertation could not be defended until the war ended. In 1946 and 1949, the defense of this dissertation divided the scholars of Moscow into two groups: those official opponents guiding the defense, who accepted the original and unorthodox manuscript, and those other professors who were against the manuscript&#x27;s acceptance. The book&#x27;s earthy, anarchic topic was the cause of many arguments that ceased only when the government intervened. Ultimately, Bakhtin was denied a higher doctoral degree (Doctor of Sciences) and granted a lesser degree (Candidate of Sciences, a research doctorate), by the State Accrediting Bureau. Later, Bakhtin was invited back to Saransk, where he took on the position of chair of the General Literature Department at the Mordovian Pedagogical Institute. When, in 1957, the Institute changed from a teachers&#x27; college to a university, Bakhtin became head of the Department of Russian and World Literature. In 1961, Bakhtin&#x27;s deteriorating health forced him to retire, and in 1969, in search of medical attention, he moved back to Moscow, where he lived until his death in 1975.

Bakhtin&#x27;s works and ideas gained popularity only after his death, and he endured difficult conditions for much of his professional life, a time in which information was often seen as dangerous and therefore was often hidden. As a result, the details provided now are often of uncertain accuracy. Also contributing to the imprecision of these details is the limited access to Russian archival information during Bakhtin&#x27;s life. It was only after the archives became public that scholars realized that much of what they thought they knew about Bakhtin&#x27;s life was false or skewed, largely by Bakhtin himself.

== Works and ideas ==

=== &quot;Toward a Philosophy of the Act&quot; ===
&quot;Toward a Philosophy of the Act&quot; was first published in the USSR in 1986 with the title &quot;K filosofii postupka&quot;. The manuscript, written between 1919 and 1921, was found in bad condition with pages missing and sections of text that were illegible. Consequently, this philosophical essay appears today as a fragment of an unfinished work.&quot;Toward a Philosophy of the Act&quot; comprises only an introduction, of which the first few pages are missing, and part one of the full text. However, Bakhtin&#x27;s intentions for the work were not altogether lost: he provided an outline in the introduction, in which he stated that the essay was to contain four parts. The first part of the essay provides an analysis of performed acts or deeds that comprise &quot;the world actually experienced&quot;, as opposed to &quot;the merely thinkable world.&quot; For the three subsequent and unfinished parts of &quot;Toward a Philosophy of the Act&quot;, Bakhtin states the topics he intended to discuss: the second part would have dealt with aesthetic activity and the ethics of artistic creation; the third with the ethics of politics; and the fourth with religion.

&quot;Toward a Philosophy of the Act&quot; reveals a Bakhtin in the process of developing his moral system by decentralizing the work of Kant, with a focus on ethics and aesthetics. It is here that Bakhtin lays out three claims regarding the acknowledgment of the uniqueness of one&#x27;s participation in Being:
# I both actively and passively participate in Being.
# My uniqueness is given but it simultaneously exists only to the degree to which I actualize this uniqueness (in other words, it is in the performed act and deed that has yet to be achieved).
# Because I am actual and irreplaceable I must actualize my uniqueness.

Bakhtin further states: &quot;It is in relation to the whole actual unity that my unique thought arises from my unique place in Being.&quot; Bakhtin deals with the concept of morality whereby he attributes the predominating legalistic notion of morality to human moral action. According to Bakhtin, the I cannot maintain neutrality toward moral and ethical demands which manifest themselves as one&#x27;s voice of consciousness.

It is here also that Bakhtin introduces an &quot;architectonic&quot; or schematic model of the human psyche, consisting of three components: &quot;I-for-myself&quot;, &quot;I-for-the-other&quot;, and &quot;other-for-me&quot;. The I-for-myself is an unreliable source of identity; Bakhtin argues that it is the I-for-the-other through which human beings develop a sense of identity. The I-for-the-other serves as an amalgamation of the way in which others view the subject. Conversely, other-for-me describes the way in which others incorporate the subject&#x27;s perceptions of them into their own identities. Identity, as Bakhtin describes it here, does not belong merely to the individual. Instead, it is shared by all.

=== &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky&#x27;s Poetics&quot;: polyphony and unfinalizability ===

During his time in Leningrad, Bakhtin shifted his view away from the philosophy characteristic of his early works and towards the notion of dialogue. It was at this time that he began his engagement with the work of Fyodor Dostoevsky. &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky&#x27;s Poetics&quot; is considered to be Bakhtin&#x27;s seminal work, a work in which he introduces a number of important concepts. The work was originally published in Russia as &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky&#x27;s Creative Art&quot; (Russian: Проблемы творчества Достоевского) in 1929, but was revised and extended in 1963 under the new title. It is the later work that is best known in the West.

The concept of &quot;unfinalizability&quot; is particularly important to Bakhtin&#x27;s analysis of Dostoevsky&#x27;s approach to character, although he frequently discussed it in other contexts. He summarises the general principle behind unfinalizability in Dostoevsky thus:Nothing conclusive has yet taken place in the world, the ultimate word of the world and about the world has not yet been spoken, the world is open and free, everything is still in the future and will always be in the future.
 On the individual level, this means that a person can never be entirely externally defined: the ability to never be fully enclosed by others&#x27; objectifications is essential to subjective consciousness. Though external finalization (definition, description, causal or genetic explanation etc) is inevitable and even necessary, it can never be the &quot;whole&quot; truth, devoid of the living response. Bakhtin is critical of what he calls the monologic tradition in Western thought that seeks to finalize humanity, and individual humans, in this way. He argues that Dostoevsky always wrote in opposition to ways of thinking that turn human beings into objects (scientific, economic, social, psychological etc.) – conceptual frameworks that enclose people in an alien web of definition and causation, robbing them of freedom and responsibility: &quot;He saw in it a degrading &quot;reification&quot; of a person&#x27;s soul, a discounting of its freedom and its unfinalizability... Dostoevsky always represents a person &quot;on the threshold&quot; of a final decision, at a moment of crisis, at an unfinalizable, and &quot;unpredeterminable&quot;, turning point for their soul.&quot;

&#x27;Carnivalization&#x27; is a term used by Bakhtin to describe the techniques Dostoevsky uses to disarm this increasingly ubiquitous enemy and make true intersubjective dialogue possible. The &quot;carnival sense of the world&quot;, a way of thinking and experiencing that Bakhtin identifies in ancient and medieval carnival traditions, has been transposed into a literary tradition that reaches its peak in Dostoevsky&#x27;s novels. The concept suggests an ethos where normal hierarchies, social roles, proper behaviors and assumed truths are subverted in favor of the &quot;joyful relativity&quot; of free participation in the festival. According to Morson and Emerson, Bakhtin&#x27;s &quot;carnival&quot; is &quot;the apotheosis of unfinalizability&quot;. Carnival, through its temporary dissolution or reversal of conventions, generates the &#x27;threshold&#x27; situations where disparate individuals come together and express themselves on an equal footing, without the oppressive constraints of social objectification: the usual preordained hierarchy of persons and values becomes an occasion for laughter, its absence an opportunity for creative interaction. In carnival, &quot;opposites come together, look at one another, are reflected in one another, know and understand one another.&quot; Bakhtin sees carnivalization in this sense as a basic principle of Dostoevsky&#x27;s art: love and hate, faith and atheism, loftiness and degradation, love of life and self-destruction, purity and vice, etc. &quot;everything in his world lives on the very border of its opposite.&quot;

&quot;Carnivalization&quot; and its generic counterpart—Menippean satire—were not a part of the earlier book, but Bakhtin discusses them at great length in the chapter &quot;Characteristics of Genre and Plot Composition in Dostoesky&#x27;s Works&quot; in the revised version. He traces the origins of Menippean satire back to ancient Greece, briefly describes a number of historical examples of the genre, and examines its essential characteristics. These characteristics include intensified comicality, freedom from established constraints, bold use of fantastic situations for the testing of truth, abrupt changes, inserted genres and multi-tonality, parodies, oxymorons, scandal scenes, inappropriate behaviour, and a sharp satirical focus on contemporary ideas and issues. Bakhtin credits Dostoevsky with revitalizing the genre and enhancing it with his own innovation in form and structure: the &quot;polyphonic&quot; novel.

According to Bakhtin, Dostoevsky was the creator of the polyphonic novel, and it was a fundamentally new genre that could not be analysed according to preconceived frameworks and schema that might be useful for other manifestations of the European novel. Dostoevsky does not describe characters and contrive plot within the context of a single authorial reality: rather his function as author is to illuminate the &quot;self-consciousness&quot; of the characters so that each participates on their own terms, in their own voice, according to their own ideas about themselves and the world. Bakhtin calls this multi-voiced reality &quot;polyphony&quot;: &quot;&quot;a plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices&quot;...&quot; Later he defines it as &quot;the event of interaction between autonomous and internally unfinalized consciousnesses.&quot;

=== &quot;Rabelais and His World&quot;: carnival and grotesque ===

During World War II Bakhtin submitted a dissertation on the French Renaissance writer François Rabelais which was not defended until some years later. The controversial ideas discussed within the work caused much disagreement, and it was consequently decided that Bakhtin be denied his higher doctorate. Thus, due to its content, &quot;Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance&quot; was not published until 1965, at which time it was given the title &quot;Rabelais and His World&quot; (Russian: Творчество Франсуа Рабле и народная культура средневековья и Ренессанса, &quot;Tvorčestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaja kul&#x27;tura srednevekov&#x27;ja i Renessansa&quot;).
In &quot;Rabelais and His World&quot;, a classic of Renaissance studies, Bakhtin concerns himself with the openness of &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;; however, the book itself also serves as an example of such openness. Throughout the text, Bakhtin attempts two things: he seeks to recover sections of &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; that, in the past, were either ignored or suppressed, and conducts an analysis of the Renaissance social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. It is by means of this analysis that Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: the first is &quot;carnival&quot; (carnivalesque) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is &quot;grotesque realism&quot; which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in &quot;Rabelais and His World&quot; Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body and the material bodily lower stratum.

In &quot;Rabelais and His World&quot;, Bakhtin intentionally refers to the distinction between &quot;official festivities&quot; and &quot;folk festivities&quot;. While official festivities aim to supply a legacy for authority, folk festivities have a critical centrifugal social function. Carnival, in this sense is categorized as a folk festivity by Bakhtin.

In his chapter on the history of laughter, Bakhtin advances the notion of its therapeutic and liberating force, arguing that &quot;laughing truth ... degraded power&quot;.

=== &quot;The Dialogic Imagination&quot;: chronotope and heteroglossia ===

&quot;The Dialogic Imagination&quot; (first published as a whole in 1975) is a compilation of four essays concerning language and the novel: &quot;Epic and Novel&quot; (1941), &quot;From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse&quot; (1940), &quot;Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel&quot; (1937–1938), and &quot;Discourse in the Novel&quot; (1934–1935). It is through the essays contained within &quot;The Dialogic Imagination&quot; that Bakhtin introduces the concepts of &quot;heteroglossia&quot;, &quot;dialogism&quot; and &quot;chronotope&quot;, making a significant contribution to the realm of literary scholarship. Bakhtin explains the generation of meaning through the &quot;primacy of context over text&quot; (heteroglossia), the hybrid nature of language (polyglossia) and the relation between utterances (intertextuality). Heteroglossia is &quot;the base condition governing the operation of meaning in any utterance.&quot; To make an utterance means to &quot;appropriate the words of others and populate them with one&#x27;s own intention.&quot; Bakhtin&#x27;s deep insights on dialogicality represent a substantive shift from views on the nature of language and knowledge by major thinkers such as Ferdinand de Saussure and Immanuel Kant.

In &quot;Epic and Novel&quot;, Bakhtin demonstrates the novel&#x27;s distinct nature by contrasting it with the epic. By doing so, Bakhtin shows that the novel is well-suited to the post-industrial civilization in which we live because it flourishes on diversity. It is this same diversity that the epic attempts to eliminate from the world. According to Bakhtin, the novel as a genre is unique in that it is able to embrace, ingest, and devour other genres while still maintaining its status as a novel. Other genres, however, cannot emulate the novel without damaging their own distinct identity.

&quot;From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse&quot; is a less traditional essay in which Bakhtin reveals how various different texts from the past have ultimately come together to form the modern novel.

&quot;Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel&quot; introduces Bakhtin&#x27;s concept of chronotope. This essay applies the concept in order to further demonstrate the distinctive quality of the novel. The word &quot;chronotope&quot; literally means &quot;time space&quot; (a concept he refers to that of Einstein) and is defined by Bakhtin as &quot;the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature.&quot; In writing, an author must create entire worlds and, in doing so, is forced to make use of the organizing categories of the real world in which the author lives. For this reason &quot;chronotope&quot; is a concept that engages reality.

The final essay, &quot;Discourse in the Novel&quot;, is one of Bakhtin&#x27;s most complete statements concerning his philosophy of language. It is here that Bakhtin provides a model for a history of discourse and introduces the concept of heteroglossia. The term &quot;heteroglossia&quot; refers to the qualities of a language that are extralinguistic, but common to all languages. These include qualities such as perspective, evaluation, and ideological positioning. In this way most languages are incapable of neutrality, for every word is inextricably bound to the context in which it exists.

=== &quot;Speech Genres and Other Late Essays&quot; ===
In &quot;Speech Genres and Other Late Essays&quot; Bakhtin moves away from the novel and concerns himself with the problems of method and the nature of culture. There are six essays that comprise this compilation: &quot;Response to a Question from the &quot;Novy Mir&quot; Editorial Staff&quot;, &quot;The &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; and Its Significance in the History of Realism&quot;, &quot;The Problem of Speech Genres&quot;, &quot;The Problem of the Text in Linguistics, Philology, and the Human Sciences: An Experiment in Philosophical Analysis&quot;, &quot;From Notes Made in 1970–71&quot;, and &quot;Toward a Methodology for the Human Sciences&quot;.

&quot;Response to a Question from the &quot;Novy Mir&quot; Editorial Staff&quot; is a transcript of comments made by Bakhtin to a reporter from a monthly journal called &quot;Novy Mir&quot; that was widely read by Soviet intellectuals. The transcript expresses Bakhtin&#x27;s opinion of literary scholarship whereby he highlights some of its shortcomings and makes suggestions for improvement.

&quot;The &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; and Its Significance in the History of Realism&quot; is a fragment from one of Bakhtin&#x27;s lost books. The publishing house to which Bakhtin had submitted the full manuscript was blown up during the German invasion and Bakhtin was in possession of only the prospectus. However, due to a shortage of paper, Bakhtin began using this remaining section to roll cigarettes. So only a portion of the opening section remains. This remaining section deals primarily with Goethe.

&quot;The Problem of Speech Genres&quot; deals with the difference between Saussurean linguistics and language as a living dialogue (translinguistics). In a relatively short space, this essay takes up a topic about which Bakhtin had planned to write a book, making the essay a rather dense and complex read. It is here that Bakhtin distinguishes between literary and everyday language. According to Bakhtin, genres exist not merely in language, but rather in communication. In dealing with genres, Bakhtin indicates that they have been studied only within the realm of rhetoric and literature, but each discipline draws largely on genres that exist outside both rhetoric and literature. These extraliterary genres have remained largely unexplored. Bakhtin makes the distinction between primary genres and secondary genres, whereby primary genres legislate those words, phrases, and expressions that are acceptable in everyday life, and secondary genres are characterized by various types of text such as legal, scientific, etc.

&quot;The Problem of the Text in Linguistics, Philology, and the Human Sciences: An Experiment in Philosophical Analysis&quot; is a compilation of the thoughts Bakhtin recorded in his notebooks. These notes focus mostly on the problems of the text, but various other sections of the paper discuss topics he has taken up elsewhere, such as speech genres, the status of the author, and the distinct nature of the human sciences. However, &quot;The Problem of the Text&quot; deals primarily with dialogue and the way in which a text relates to its context. Speakers, Bakhtin claims, shape an utterance according to three variables: the object of discourse, the immediate addressee, and a &quot;superaddressee&quot;. This is what Bakhtin describes as the tertiary nature of dialogue.

&quot;From Notes Made in 1970–71&quot; appears also as a collection of fragments extracted from notebooks Bakhtin kept during the years of 1970 and 1971. It is here that Bakhtin discusses interpretation and its endless possibilities. According to Bakhtin, humans have a habit of making narrow interpretations, but such limited interpretations only serve to weaken the richness of the past.

The final essay, &quot;Toward a Methodology for the Human Sciences&quot;, originates from notes Bakhtin wrote during the mid-seventies and is the last piece of writing Bakhtin produced before he died. In this essay he makes a distinction between dialectic and dialogics and comments on the difference between the text and the aesthetic object. It is here also, that Bakhtin differentiates himself from the Formalists, who, he felt, underestimated the importance of content while oversimplifying change, and the Structuralists, who too rigidly adhered to the concept of &quot;code.&quot;

== Disputed texts ==
Some of the works which bear the names of Bakhtin&#x27;s close friends V. N. Voloshinov and P. N. Medvedev have been attributed to Bakhtin – particularly &quot;Marxism and Philosophy of Language&quot; and &quot;The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship&quot;. These claims originated in the early 1970s and received their earliest full articulation in English in Clark and Holquist&#x27;s 1984 biography of Bakhtin. In the years since then, however, most scholars have come to agree that Vološinov and Medvedev ought to be considered the true authors of these works. Although Bakhtin undoubtedly influenced these scholars and may even have had a hand in composing the works attributed to them, it now seems clear that if it was necessary to attribute authorship of these works to one person, Voloshinov and Medvedev respectively should receive credit.
Bakhtin had a difficult life and career, and few of his works were published in an authoritative form during his lifetime. As a result, there is substantial disagreement over matters that are normally taken for granted: in which discipline he worked (was he a philosopher or literary critic?), how to periodize his work, and even which texts he wrote (see below). He is known for a series of concepts that have been used and adapted in a number of disciplines: dialogism, the carnivalesque, the chronotope, heteroglossia and &quot;outsidedness&quot; (the English translation of a Russian term &quot;vnenakhodimost,&quot; sometimes rendered into English—from French rather than from Russian—as &quot;exotopy&quot;). Together these concepts outline a distinctive philosophy of language and culture that has at its center the claims that all discourse is in essence a dialogical exchange and that this endows all language with a particular ethical or ethico-political force.

== Legacy ==

As a literary theorist, Bakhtin is associated with the Russian Formalists, and his work is compared with that of Juri Lotman; in 1963 Roman Jakobson mentioned him as one of the few intelligent critics of Formalism. During the 1920s, Bakhtin&#x27;s work tended to focus on ethics and aesthetics in general. Early pieces such as &quot;Towards a Philosophy of the Act&quot; and &quot;Author and Hero in Aesthetic Activity&quot; are indebted to the philosophical trends of the time—particularly the Marburg school neo-Kantianism of Hermann Cohen, including Ernst Cassirer, Max Scheler and, to a lesser extent, Nicolai Hartmann. Bakhtin began to be discovered by scholars in 1963, but it was only after his death in 1975 that authors such as Julia Kristeva and Tzvetan Todorov brought Bakhtin to the attention of the Francophone world, and from there his popularity in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries continued to grow. In the late 1980s, Bakhtin&#x27;s work experienced a surge of popularity in the West.

Bakhtin&#x27;s primary works include &quot;Toward a Philosophy of the Act,&quot; an unfinished portion of a philosophical essay; &quot;Problems of Dostoyevsky&#x27;s Art,&quot; to which Bakhtin later added a chapter on the concept of carnival and published with the title &quot;Problems of Dostoyevsky&#x27;s Poetics&quot;; &quot;Rabelais and His World,&quot; which explores the openness of the Rabelaisian novel; &quot;The Dialogic Imagination,&quot; whereby the four essays that comprise the work introduce the concepts of dialogism, heteroglossia, and chronotope; and &quot;Speech Genres and Other Late Essays,&quot; a collection of essays in which Bakhtin concerns himself with method and culture.

In the 1920s there was a &quot;Bakhtin school&quot; in Russia, in line with the discourse analysis of Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson.

=== Influence ===
He is known today for his interest in a wide variety of subjects, ideas, vocabularies, and periods, as well as his use of authorial disguises, and for his influence (alongside György Lukács) on the growth of Western scholarship on the novel as a premiere literary genre. As a result of the breadth of topics with which he dealt, Bakhtin has influenced such Western schools of theory as Neo-Marxism, Structuralism, Social constructionism, and Semiotics. Bakhtin&#x27;s works have also been useful in anthropology, especially theories of ritual. However, his influence on such groups has, somewhat paradoxically, resulted in narrowing the scope of Bakhtin&#x27;s work. According to Clark and Holquist, rarely do those who incorporate Bakhtin&#x27;s ideas into theories of their own appreciate his work in its entirety.

While Bakhtin is traditionally seen as a literary critic, there can be no denying his impact on the realm of rhetorical theory. Among his many theories and ideas Bakhtin indicates that style is a developmental process, occurring within both the user of language and language itself. His work instills in the reader an awareness of tone and expression that arises from the careful formation of verbal phrasing. By means of his writing, Bakhtin has enriched the experience of verbal and written expression which ultimately aids the formal teaching of writing. Some even suggest that Bakhtin introduces a new meaning to rhetoric because of his tendency to reject the separation of language and ideology. According to Leslie Baxter, for Bakhtin, &quot;all language use is riddled with multiple voices (to be understood more generally as discourses, ideologies, perspectives, or themes)&quot; and thus &quot;meaning-making in general can be understood as the interplay of those voices.&quot;

=== Bakhtin and communication studies ===
Bakhtin has been called &quot;the philosopher of human communication&quot;. Kim argues that Bakhtin&#x27;s theories of dialogue and literary representation are potentially applicable to virtually all academic disciplines in the human sciences. According to White, Bakhtin&#x27;s dialogism represents a methodological turn towards &quot;the messy reality of communication, in all its many language forms.&quot; While Bakhtin&#x27;s works focused primarily on text, interpersonal communication is also key, especially when the two are related in terms of culture. Kim states that &quot;culture as Geertz and Bakhtin allude to can be generally transmitted through communication or reciprocal interaction such as a dialogue.&quot;

==== Communication and culture ====
According to Leslie Baxter, &quot;Bakhtin&#x27;s life work can be understood as a critique of the monologization of the human experience that he perceived in the dominant linguistic, literary, philosophical, and political theories of his time.&quot; He was &quot;critical of efforts to reduce the unfinalizable, open, and multivocal process of meaning-making in determinate, closed, totalizing ways.&quot; For Baxter, Bakhtin&#x27;s dialogism enables communication scholars to conceive of difference in new ways. The background of a subject must be taken into consideration when conducting research into their understanding of any text, since &quot;a dialogic perspective argues that difference (of all kinds) is basic to the human experience.&quot; Culture and communication become inextricably linked, as one&#x27;s understanding of a given utterance, text, or message, is contingent upon one&#x27;s cultural background and experience.

Kim argues that &quot;his ideas of art as a vehicle oriented towards interaction with its audience in order to express or communicate any sort of intention is reminiscent of Clifford Geertz&#x27;s theories on culture.&quot;

==== Carnivalesque and communication ====
Sheckels contends that &quot;what [... Bakhtin] terms the &#x27;carnivalesque&#x27; is tied to the body and the public exhibition of its more private functions [...] it served also as a communication event [...] anti-authority communication events [...] can also be deemed &#x27;carnivalesque&#x27;.&quot; Essentially, the act of turning society around through communication, whether it be in the form of text, protest, or otherwise serves as a communicative form of carnival, according to Bakhtin. Steele furthers the idea of carnivalesque in communication as she argues that it is found in corporate communication. Steele states &quot;that ritualized sales meetings, annual employee picnics, retirement roasts and similar corporate events fit the category of carnival.&quot; Carnival cannot help but be linked to communication and culture as Steele points out that &quot;in addition to qualities of inversion, ambivalence, and excess, carnival&#x27;s themes typically include a fascination with the body, particularly its little-glorified or &#x27;lower strata&#x27; parts, and dichotomies between &#x27;high&#x27; or &#x27;low&#x27;.&quot; The high and low binary is particularly relevant in communication as certain verbiage is considered high, while slang is considered low. Moreover, much of popular communication including television shows, books, and movies fall into high and low brow categories. This is particularly prevalent in Bakhtin&#x27;s native Russia, where postmodernist writers such as Boris Akunin have worked to change low brow communication forms (such as the mystery novel) into higher literary works of art by making constant references to one of Bakhtin&#x27;s favorite subjects, Dostoyevsky.

<text>Weston under Penyard is a small village in Herefordshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 1,007.

It lies on the A40 road two miles east of Ross-on-Wye. The Penyard is a prominent hill.

==History==
The parish church of St Lawrence has a tall 14th-century west tower which had a spire until it was damaged by lightning in 1750.

A Wesleyan chapel was constructed at Buryhill during the early 19th century but was disused by 1964. The building was subsequently converted for use as private residence.

Slightly to the east under farmland lies the former Roman settlement of Ariconium, which gave its name to the historical Welsh Kingdom spanning areas of what is now known as Herefordshire Ergyng and Archenfield. The name Ariconium is Romano-British and may conceivably have an equivalent in or near the Roman province of Galatia.

Herefordshire escaped most of the battles with the Vikings but in 914 the Danes made additional visits to the area and ravaged Archenfield, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (AD 915, Worcester Manuscript, p. 99). The jarls leading the raids, Ohtor and Hroald, captured Bishop Cameleac or Cyfeiliog, then the Bishop of Llandaff; he was later ransomed. The jarls were killed in a subsequent battle at &quot;Kill Dane Field&quot; in Weston-under-Penyard and the raiders were subdued.

Two miles south west are the fragmentary remains of Penyard Castle, a fourteenth-century castle on the site of which was built a seventeenth-century house. Penyard House is a Georgian building that used to operate as a hotel.

==Notable people==
Richard Amerike (c. 1445–1503), a Bristol merchant, was born in the village, and some sources suggest gave his name to America. Marc Bolan, the singer and guitarist, owned the Old Rectory in the 1970s. Richard Hammond, the former &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter, has a home, Bollitree Castle, in the village. It comprises a house built circa 1700 incorporating the remains of an earlier building, to which castellated walls, turrets and moat were added in the late eighteenth century.

==Transport==
Weston under Penyard Halt was a former station on the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway on the section between Ross-on-Wye and Grange Court and thence to Gloucester. Opened in 1929 to compete with local road transport it was located on the Great Western Railway line linking Ross-on-Wye and Gloucester. Nothing remains of the station.

<text>Arthur Scherbius (30 October 1878 – 13 May 1929) was a German electrical engineer who invented the mechanical cipher Enigma machine. He patented the invention and later sold the machine under the brand name Enigma.

Scherbius offered unequalled opportunities and showed the importance of cryptography to both military and civil intelligence.

==Biography==
===Early life and work===
Scherbius was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. His father was a businessman.

He studied electrical engineering at the Technical University Munich and then went on to study at the Leibniz University Hannover, finishing in March 1903. The next year he completed a dissertation entitled &quot;Proposal for the Construction of an Indirect Water Turbine Governor&quot; and was awarded a doctorate in engineering (Dr.-Eng.).

===Career===
Scherbius subsequently worked for a number of electrical firms in Germany and Switzerland. In 1918 he founded the firm of Scherbius &amp; Ritter. He made a number of inventions including asynchronous motors, electric pillows and ceramic heating parts. His research contributions led to his name being associated with the Scherbius principle for asynchronous motors.

Scherbius applied for a patent (filed 23 February 1918) for a cipher machine based on rotating wired wheels that is now known as a rotor machine.

====The Enigma machine====
His first design of the Enigma was called Model A and was about the size and shape of a cash register (50 kg). Then followed Model B and Model C, which was a portable device in which the letters were indicated by lamps. The Enigma machine looked like a typewriter in a wooden box.

He called his machine Enigma which is the Greek word for &quot;riddle&quot;. Combining three rotors from a set of five, each of the 3 rotor setting with 26 positions, and the plug board with ten pairs of letters connected, the military Enigma has 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 (nearly 159 quintillion) different settings. (5 × 4 × 3) × (263) × [26! / (6! × 10! × 210)] = 158,962,555,217,826,360,000.

The firm&#x27;s cipher machine, marketed under the name &quot;Enigma&quot;, was initially pitched at the commercial market. There were several commercial models; one of them was adopted by the German Navy (in a modified version) in 1926. The German Army adopted the same machine (also in a modified version somewhat different from the Navy&#x27;s) a few years later.

Scherbius initially had to contend with the lack of interest in his invention, but he was convinced that his Enigma would be marketable. However, the German Army did become interested in a new cryptographic device despite several disappointments in the past. The serial production of the Enigma started in 1925 and the first machines came into use in 1926.

Scherbius&#x27; Enigma provided the German Army with one of the strongest cryptographic ciphers at the time. German military communications were protected using Enigma machines during World War II until they were eventually cracked by Bletchley Park due to a fatal flaw in the encryption algorithm whereby characters were never encrypted as themselves. 

Scherbius however did not live to see the widespread use of his machine. In 1929, Scherbius died in a horse carriage accident in Berlin-Wannsee, where he had lived since 1924.

<doc id="578023" wikidata="Q733338" url="?curid=578023" title="West Falkland">
<text>West Falkland () is the second largest of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. It is a hilly island, separated from East Falkland by the Falkland Sound. Its area is , 37% of the total area of the islands. Its coastline is long.

==Population==
The island has fewer than 200 people, scattered around the coastline. The largest settlement is Port Howard on the east coast, which has an airstrip. Other settlements include Albemarle, Chartres, Dunnose Head, Fox Bay, Fox Bay West, Hill Cove, Port Stephens, and Roy Cove, most of which are linked by road and also have airstrips and harbours. In 1986, the population was 265, in 2001, it had fallen to 144 and rose to 160 in 2016.

Because West Falkland is outside Stanley or RAF Mount Pleasant on East Falkland it is considered part of the &quot;camp&quot;, a Falklander term for the area outside the main settlement.

==Geography and wildlife==

West Falkland is hillier on the side closest to East Falkland. The principal mountain range, the Hornby Hills, runs parallel with Falkland Sound. Mount Adam, the highest hill in the islands, is above sea level.

Formerly it was thought that Mount Robinson at above sea level was the highest point. However, a later survey found that Mount Adam was higher. At this, the Argentines transferred the name &quot;Monte Independencia&quot; from Mount Robinson to Mount Adam.
The major industry on the island is sheep farming, while it is also known for its penguin and cormorant colonies. Fishing is also popular in the two main rivers, the Warrah and the Chartres.

In the 19th century as today, indigenous land fauna was very scanty. A small wolf, the warrah, the &quot;loup-renard&quot; of Louis Antoine de Bougainville, is extinct, the last having been seen about 1875 on West Falkland. It is commemorated in the name of one of the island&#x27;s rivers – the Warrah River – and the settlement of Fox Bay. Some herds of cattle and horses ran wild; but these were introduced by settlers as were the wild hogs, the numerous rabbits and the less common hares. All these have greatly declined in numbers, being profitably replaced by sheep.

The southernmost point of West Falkland is Cape Meredith, and the most south-westerly point is Calm Head. On the southerly side lie high cliffs with an abundance of seabirds. To the west are some white sandy beaches with clean water and rolling sand dunes with tall grass. Set just back from the top of the cliffs is a single wooden hut locally referred to as Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin. The beaches are a habitat for elephant seals and are unpolluted save for the occasional piece of wreckage.

===Geology===
Most of the layers of West Falkland and its surrounding islands are slightly inclined from the horizontal. This inclination shows different types of rocks in different places. The quartzites of Port Stephens and Stanley are more resistant than the arenaceous sediments of the formation at Fox Bay. The Hornby Mountains, near Falkland Sound have experienced tectonic forces of uplift and folding which has inclined the quartzite beds of Stanley to the vertical.

In West Falkland there are several dykes that cut the rocks of the western islands, but these dykes, unlike the previous ones, are chemically more unstable and have been eroded. The only indications of their existence are the aligned linear depressions. In the margins of these depressions there is evidence of contact baking or hornfels formation adjacent to the once molten basalt dyke.

==History==
Early explorers reported the remains of canoes on West Falkland but it is unclear whether it was a one way trip, or indeed if the canoes were not swept in from Patagonia.

Captain John Strong of the &quot;Welfare&quot; made the first recorded landing on either of the main islands (West and East Falkland) on 29 January 1690 at Bold Cove on the other side of the headland from Port Howard. He said:

:&quot;Wednesday this morning we weighed and stood unto an harbour on ye west side and there came to ane anchor and sent our boat on shoar for fresh water and did kill abundance of geese and ducks but as far as wood there is none.&quot;

Although Strong recorded a lack of wood in the area, driftwood frequently washes up on Falkland beaches. This may be accounted for by the sheltered nature of Bold Cove. Strong named Falkland Sound, which gave its name to all the islands.

While the first recorded landing on the main islands of the Falklands was on West Falkland, it was settled remarkably late. In 1867 there were no settlers on West Falkland. The government issued a proclamation offering leases of grazing stations on very moderate terms and in 1868 all the available land was occupied.

Modern West Falkland is also home to two RAF Remote Radar Heads: Mount Alice, which is near Port Albemarle in the south of the island, and Mount Byron in the north.

In early 2007, the Falkland Islands Government awarded a contract to supply an east–west ferry to Workboat Services Ltd. The service runs between Port Howard and New Haven.

===Falklands War===
West Falkland saw some activity during the Falklands War in 1982; Fox Bay, Port Howard and Pebble Island were all occupied by Argentine troops during the hostilities and were subjected to occasional shore bombardment and airstrikes by the Royal Navy.

The most significant skirmish on West Falkland was perhaps the skirmish at Many Branch Point, near Port Howard.

Shag Cove saw several Argentine helicopters downed after British Harrier jump jets attacked them. The raid on Pebble Island has gone down in British Special Forces history.

<doc id="578026" wikidata="Q490063" url="?curid=578026" title="Gates Cambridge Scholarship">
<text>The Gates Cambridge Scholarship is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Cambridge. The scholarship is extremely competitive with around 1.3% of applicants receiving an award in recent years. 

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation established the Gates Cambridge Scholarships in 2000 with a $210 million donation to support outstanding graduate students&#x27; study at the University of Cambridge. The gift is the largest single donation to a British university. The Gates Cambridge Trust&#x27;s endowment is valued at £333.9 million as of 2023.

The scholarship covers the cost of a postgraduate degree at the University of Cambridge and includes funding for academic and professional development. As of 2023, 2,156 students from more than 112 countries have received the scholarship and more than 200 Gates Cambridge Scholars are studying at any time.

==Eligibility and selection criteria==

Applicants from any country other than the United Kingdom are eligible to apply for the Gates Cambridge Scholarships. Candidates must apply to pursue one of the following full-time residential degrees at the University of Cambridge:

* Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) 
* Master of Science (MSc), Master of Letters (MLitt), Master of Philosophy (MPhil)
* Other one-year postgraduate course (e.g. LLM, MRes, MASt)

Applicants concurrently apply to a course, college and department and the offer of a Gates Cambridge Scholarship is conditional on the student gaining full placement in each.

The Gates Cambridge Trustees use four criteria to choose Scholars:

*Academic excellence: Competitiveness is evaluated through academic transcripts, references, experience and the potential to succeed on the chosen course. A departmental nomination is crucial for demonstrating this criterion;
*Choice of course: The Trust seeks Scholars who will have an academically transformative experience at Cambridge. Candidates must demonstrate intellectual superiority and the necessary skills and expertise to complete the course which they have chosen;
*A commitment to improving the lives of others: A defining characteristic of Scholars is their deep devotion to improving lives of others as evident by their past, current and future commitment to the societies in which they will live and work;
*A capacity for leadership: Candidates must show exceptional leadership elements and a pledge to &#x27;take others with them&#x27; as future leaders of their fields and communities.
Generally, each class of Gates Cambridge Scholars is composed of 2⁄3 PhD and 1⁄3 one-year Scholars. The Gates Cambridge Trust uses a three-stage selection process to select its Scholars. The application process begins with prospective students applying to study for an eligible degree at the University of Cambridge, either during the U.S. or the global round. Following the initial application, each academic department at the University of Cambridge ranks and nominates eligible applicants for the scholarship. Departmental nominees are the most academically outstanding applicants for postgraduate studies in the department. The list of departmental nominees is then forwarded to the Gates Cambridge Trust, where it is divided into broad subject areas and passed to the Shortlisting Committees. Each Committee reviews the entirety of a departmental nominee and applies the Gates Cambridge selection criteria to shortlist applicants for interview. All shortlisted candidates are interviewed to assess how they meet all Gates Cambridge criteria and Scholars-Elect are selected only after the interview. For 2023 entry, 75 Scholars were selected from a pool of 6,184 applicants.

==Goals==

The aim of the Gates Cambridge programme is to build a global network of future leaders committed to improving the lives of others. Scholars and alumni are already becoming leaders in their fields and contributing to finding solutions to some of the world&#x27;s most pressing problems.

==Gates Cambridge Scholars organizations==

In 2002, Gates Cambridge Scholars organized and elected a student committee titled The Gates Scholars&#x27; Council. The Council aims to represent the Gates Scholars at Cambridge and to build a scholar community interwoven into the fabric of the university. In cooperation with the Gates Cambridge Trust, the university and various academic and professional organizations, the Scholars&#x27; Council organizes a number of academic, social and professional events that have distinguished and built the reputation of the Gates Scholars at Cambridge University. The scholarship is particularly known for its strong academic and social community at Cambridge.

In 2005, the Scholars once again self-organized to create the Gates Scholars Alumni Association, which aims to build upon the friendships and contacts that were first made at Cambridge and to bridge the gap between the different generations of scholars. It is an active and growing organization, with members dispersed all over the world.

== Controversies ==

=== Criticism of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ===
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reduced its investments in non-renewable energy in 2016, after recipients of the Gates Cambridge Scholarship had urged the Foundation&#x27;s trustees to divest from fossil fuels a year earlier.

The Foundation gave Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi its 2019 Global Goalkeeper Award for the Swachh Bharat Mission and the &quot;progress India has made in providing safe sanitation under his leadership.&quot; More than 100 Gates Cambridge Scholars and alumni had condemned the Foundation&#x27;s decision, following the Indian government&#x27;s decision to withdraw the special status of the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

<text>Boris Caesar Wilhelm Hagelin (2 July 1892 – 7 September 1983) was a Swedish businessman and inventor of encryption machines.

==Biography==
Born of Swedish parents in Adshikent, Russian Empire (now Azerbaijan), Hagelin attended Lundsberg boarding school and later studied mechanical engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, graduating in 1914. He gained experience in engineering through work in Sweden and the United States.

His father Karl Wilhelm Hagelin worked for Nobel in Baku (part of the Russian Empire at the time), but the family returned to Sweden after the Russian Revolution. Karl Wilhelm was an investor in Arvid Gerhard Damm&#x27;s company Aktiebolaget Cryptograph, established to sell rotor machines built using Damm&#x27;s 1919 patent. Boris Hagelin was placed in the firm to represent the family investment. In 1925, Hagelin took over the firm, later reorganising it as Aktiebolaget Cryptoteknik in 1932. His machines competed with Scherbius&#x27; Enigma machines, but sold rather better.

At the beginning of World War II, Hagelin moved from Sweden to Switzerland, all the way across Germany and through Berlin to Geneva, carrying the design documents for the company&#x27;s latest machine, and re-established his company there. That design was small, cheap and moderately secure, and he convinced the US military to adopt it. Many tens of thousands of them were made, and Hagelin became quite wealthy as a result. After his company, Crypto AG, was secretly sold to foreign intelligence agencies (the American CIA and German BND) in 1970, it fraudulently sold compromised machines to a variety of customers, including governments. Historian David Kahn has suggested that Hagelin was the only cypher-machine maker who ever became a millionaire.

Boris is the great-grandfather of Carl Hagelin, former NHL player for the Washington Capitals.

<text>Gustav Benjamin Schwab (19 June 1792 – 4 November 1850) was a German writer, pastor and publisher.

==Life==
Gustav Schwab was born in Stuttgart, the son of the philosopher Johann Christoph Schwab. He was introduced to the humanities early in life. After attending Gymnasium Illustre, he studied as a scholar of &quot;Tübinger Stift&quot; at University of Tübingen, his first two years studying Philology and Philosophy, and thereafter Theology. While at university he established a literary club and became a close friend of Ludwig Uhland, Karl Varnhagen and Justinus Kerner, with whom he published a collection of poems under the title &quot;Deutscher Dichterwald&quot;.

In the spring of 1813, he made a journey to northern Germany, where he met Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Friedrich Rückert, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, Adelbert von Chamisso and others. In 1818 he became a high school teacher in Stuttgart, and in 1837 he started work as a pastor in Gomaringen, near Tübingen. In 1841, he moved back to Stuttgart, where he was first pastor and then from 1845 educational counselor for Stuttgart&#x27;s high school system. In 1847 he received an honorary Doctorate from his old university.

Schwab&#x27;s collection of myths and legends of antiquity, &quot;Sagen des klassischen Altertums&quot;, published from 1838 to 1840, was widely used at German schools and became very influential for the reception of classical antiquity in German classrooms. There is a still available English translation with a foreword by Werner Jaeger.

In his later years, he traveled regularly to Überlingen am Bodensee to enjoy the waters at the city&#x27;s spa. He died in Stuttgart in 1850.

<text>Thomas Michael Jopling, Baron Jopling, PC, DL (born 10 December 1930) is a British politician who sits in the House of Lords as a member of the Conservative Party.

==Life and career==
Jopling is the son of Mark Bellerby Jopling (1886–1958), of Masham, North Riding of Yorkshire, a partner in Imeson and Jopling (later Jopling, Cawthorn and Blackburn), surveyors, auctioneers and estate agents. He was educated at Cheltenham College and Durham University. He was a farmer and company director and served on the national council of the National Farmers Union. Jopling was a councillor on Thirsk Rural District Council.

Having previously stood unsuccessfully in Wakefield in 1959, Jopling was elected Conservative MP for Westmorland, now in Cumbria, in 1964 and became Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury from 1979 to 1983.
In 1983, he was elected for Westmorland and Lonsdale after boundary changes, and was appointed Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1983 to 1987.

In his &quot;Diaries&quot;, the military historian and Tory member of Parliament Alan Clark famously quoted what he claimed was Jopling&#x27;s &quot;snobby but cutting&quot; dismissal of the ambitious Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine: &quot;The trouble with Michael is that he had to buy all his furniture&quot;.

After over 32 years as a member of the House Commons, Jopling stood down at the 1997 general election and was succeeded by Tim Collins. He was absent during the last few weeks of his Commons career as he was severely injured in a go-karting accident in February 1997. He returned to the House on the last day it sat before it dissolved for the election, and was greeted at Prime Minister’s Questions by John Major at his last question session on 20 March.

Jopling was made a life peer as Baron Jopling, of Ainderby Quernhow in the County of North Yorkshire on 5 June 1997. He is a member of the Privy Council and the America All Party Parliamentary Group.

==Personal life==
Jopling married Hilary Gail Dickinson in 1958; she was appointed an MBE in 2017. The couple had two sons: Nicholas Jopling and art dealer Jay Jopling. Nicholas was active in the Conservative Party, having contested the Sedgefield constituency at the 1992 general election, but losing to the future Labour Party leader and Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Nicholas&#x27;s son Caspar (Jopling&#x27;s grandson) was married to singer Ellie Goulding from 2019 to 2024.

Jopling is an Honorary member of the Buck&#x27;s and Royal Automobile clubs. He lives at Ainderby Hall in Thirsk.

<doc id="578037" wikidata="Q3700208" url="?curid=578037" title="William Leonard Pickard">
<text>William Leonard Pickard (born October 21, 1945) is one of two people convicted in the largest lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) manufacturing case in history. In 2000, while moving their LSD laboratory across Kansas, Pickard and Clyde Apperson were pulled over while driving a Ryder rental truck and a follow car. The laboratory had been stored near a renovated Atlas-E missile silo near Wamego, Kansas. Gordon Todd Skinner, one of the men intimately involved in the case but not charged due to his cooperation, owned the property where the laboratory equipment was stored.

On July 27, 2020, Pickard was granted compassionate release from federal prison 20 years into his sentence.

==Background==
Prior to his arrest, Pickard was deputy director of the Drug Policy Research Program at the University of California, Los Angeles. He came from a well-to-do family; his father was a lawyer and his stepmother was a fungal disease expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In high school, he was an honors student, played basketball, and was named &quot;most intellectual&quot;. He earned a scholarship to Princeton University, but dropped out after one term, instead preferring to hang out at Greenwich Village jazz clubs. In 1971, he got a job as a research manager at the University of California, Berkeley, Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, a job he held until 1974. From then on, his academic resume begins a 20-year gap.

It is reported by LSD historian Mark McCloud that Pickard worked with a group of LSD traffickers, known as the Clear Light System, in the 1960s. Pickard is said to have contributed to LSD chemist Nicholas Sand&#x27;s legal fund following Sand&#x27;s arrest in 1972. Pickard also reportedly had a background manufacturing the drug MDA.

In December 1988, a neighbor reported a strange chemical odor coming from an architectural shop at a Mountain View, California, industrial park. Federal agents arrived to find 200,000 doses of LSD and Pickard inside. Pickard was charged with manufacturing LSD and served five years in prison.

By 1994, Pickard had enrolled at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. There, he focused on drug abuse in the former Soviet Union, where he theorized that the booming black market and many unemployed chemists could lead to a flood of the drug market.

==LSD manufacturing==

It is not publicly known where Pickard initially produced LSD. His first arrest for manufacturing LSD came on December 28, 1988, in Mountain View, California. The laboratory was contained inside a trailer that had been moved into a warehouse. It contained state-of-the-art equipment, including a roto-evaporator, heating mantles and a pill press. He was producing kilogram quantities of LSD and putting them onto windowpane (gel), microdot (tablet), and blotter forms (blotter paper). He spent time in prison for this and became a Buddhist while inside.
Pickard had laboratories in a number of different locations. Pickard never liked to stay at one location more than two years so as not to draw attention to himself. In early 1996, the lab was located in Oregon; it was subsequently moved to Aspen, Colorado, in late 1996. From September 1997 to September 1999, the laboratory was located in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He liked the Santa Fe location for a number of reasons; his overhead costs were lower and the precursor source was closer. He also liked the fact that there was virtually no humidity, which can affect the production of LSD. All of the laboratories are alleged to have produced a kilogram of LSD approximately every five weeks. Gordon Todd Skinner became involved with Pickard and his partner Clyde Apperson in February 1998. It is rumored that Pickard and Skinner were introduced to each other in a somewhat formal gathering of various LSD dealers and chemists. The meeting is said to have taken place in the former home of Jerry and Carolyn Garcia (Mountain Girl), where Skinner was allegedly then living.

One of his main customers was a man named &quot;Petaluma Al&quot; from Petaluma, California. Pickard would always arrange for the produced LSD to be transported to the Denver, Colorado, or Boulder, Colorado, area to be mailed or picked up so that Petaluma Al would never know where the laboratory was located. Most of Petaluma Al&#x27;s customers were overseas in Europe, which meant that in addition to millions of dollars in United States currency, Pickard also handled millions in Dutch guilders and Canadian bank notes. He preferred to deal in ƒ1,000 notes or Canadian $1,000 notes (discontinued since 2000 in Canada) because it meant less bulk cash to have on hand. He required his distributors to convert all lower currencies into $50 or $100 notes at the least so as not to cause problems.

Although Apperson and Pickard were arrested moving the laboratory from the Atlas-E silo location, they never actually produced LSD at this site. The laboratory had been moved there without Pickard&#x27;s or Apperson&#x27;s knowledge by the government&#x27;s informant, Gordon Todd Skinner. When Pickard arrived back in town and learned that Skinner had moved the lab there, they immediately began preparations to move it. Unknown to them, Skinner had begun cooperating with the DEA and had already allowed them to go inside the property to look around. Based on what they saw during this visit, they applied for a search warrant, which was subsequently signed by a federal judge. Apperson drove the Ryder rental truck with the laboratory in it and Pickard followed in a Buick LeSabre; they had walkie-talkies to maintain communication. The DEA had a Kansas Highway Patrol car pull them over to not arouse suspicion; however, they immediately recognized something was wrong and Pickard, being a marathon runner, took off into the woods on foot and was not captured until the next day.
Authorities found less than of ergotamine tartrate during the arrest. However, they claim they normally produced up to a kilogram of LSD every five weeks. This would produce approximately ten million 100-microgram doses. Although the DEA claims this would be worth $40 million on the street, Pickard did not sell anywhere near the &quot;street&quot; or retail level. Government informant Skinner testified that Petaluma Al and the largest wholesale customers of Pickard paid 29 cents per 100 μg dose, which would put the cost at around $2.97 million for a kilogram of LSD.

Apperson was Pickard&#x27;s partner and was reportedly a skilled chemist, but his role was mainly in the setup and take-down of the laboratory. He was allegedly paid $100,000 for assembling and $50,000 for packing away the lab. Apperson reportedly manufactured synthetic mescaline. When authorities searched his Sunnyvale, California, home, they found five drums of precursor chemicals needed to manufacture synthetic mescaline.

Both Pickard and Apperson were eventually found guilty at trial of conspiring to manufacture, distribute, and dispense ten grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); Pickard received two life sentences, while Apperson received 30 years&#x27; imprisonment.

=== Scale of production ===
According to court testimony, Pickard&#x27;s lab produced up to a kilogram of LSD approximately every five weeks for short periods. Despite criticism for their methodology, the DEA contends that there was a 99.5% drop in the availability of LSD in the US in the two years following the arrest. Pickard himself has long denied these claims. In his 2008 paper &quot;International LSD Prevalence – Factors Affecting Proliferation and Control&quot;, Pickard suggests that since the 1960s, LSD production has always been de-centralized. As to a turn-of-the-century decline in availability due to his own arrest, Pickard highlights the fact that LSD availability had been on the decline since 1996, a fact which he correlates in part with the exponential growth of availability and demand for MDMA and other hallucinogenic drugs. The actual quantity of LSD seized by the DEA remains unclear, with figures ranging from 198.9 grams to 41.3 kilograms (410 million 100 μg hits of LSD).

The turn-of-the-century &quot;acid drought&quot; was likely due to a number of factors, perhaps including but not limited to the arrest of Pickard. According to &quot;&quot;, additional factors included the 1996 arrest of longtime LSD chemist Nicholas Sand and the death of a man involved in the illicit sale of LSD precursor materials. Grateful Dead concerts provided a primary distribution network for LSD, and this network dissolved when the Grateful Dead stopped touring in 1995.

==Imprisonment==
While serving two life sentences at the U.S. Penitentiary at Tucson, Arizona, Pickard conducted research on civil liberties, justice and drug-related topics. He wrote of his concerns about the opioid epidemic in the United States, and responded to media and academic requests on the subject. The website &quot;Free William Leonard Pickard&quot; posted regular updates about his activities until September 2017. In 2015 he published a novel, &quot;The Rose of Paracelsus&quot;.

Pickard discussed his imprisonment with the writer and former LSD seller Seth Ferranti in 2016: &quot;While doing research in unstable regions abroad, amid the chaos, I found my way by noticing the instances of humanity. Captive populations are similar; courtesy and service to others is the only path. ... long-term prisoners, especially the nonviolent who may be captive for decades, somehow retain a certain dignity. In all these years, lost among the thousands, I have seen only one man cry.&quot; He described teaching a fellow inmate to read: &quot;it was a privilege each morning to teach reading to an illiterate black man in his forties. We laughed sometimes, but always yearned for our families ... He hid Jack and Jill from his cellmate, so others would not ridicule him. I asked why he wanted to learn. He replied, &#x27;So I can read bedtime stories to my children.&#x27; How very brave he was.&quot; In addition, Pickard also met and befriended Silk Road website founder Ross Ulbricht while in prison, and maintains contact with his family.

On July 27, 2020, Pickard was released from prison on compassionate grounds with the court citing his advanced age and medical conditions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Apperson was also released. On December 22, 2024 Apperson&#x27;s sentence was commuted by President Joe Biden. [22]

==Publications==
Pickard&#x27;s 2008 paper &quot;International LSD Prevalence – Factors Affecting Proliferation and Control&quot; questions the validity of law enforcement reports about LSD manufacturing, and discusses the civil liberties threats posed by the DEA&#x27;s NADDIS database system.

In 2011 Pickard authored an overview of the NADDIS system entitled &quot;DEA&#x27;s NADDIS System: A Guide for Attorneys, the Courts, and Researchers&quot;.

===&quot;The Rose of Paracelsus&quot;===
In 2015 Pickard published The Rose of Paracelsus: On Secrets &amp; Sacraments, a 656-page autobiography that blends fiction and nonfiction. The book centers around six chemists in an international drug organization. One of the Six tells Pickard, the book&#x27;s narrator, that the making of psychedelics is not just following a recipe or formula but requires &quot;the requisite spirit ... the purest intent, a flawless diamond morality&quot;. He says it&#x27;s the same spirit described in Thomas De Quincey and Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s short stories about Paracelsus, the 16th-century physician and alchemist of Basel who resurrected a rose from its ashes: &quot;there could be no creation for lack of faith and the trust of gold&quot;.

Writing while incarcerated, Pickard wrote the entire book with pencil and paper. In an interview with Seth Ferranti, Pickard recounted: &quot;&quot;The Rose&quot; was handwritten in two years, without notes and based on recollection, but seemed too trivial to honor the reader. I destroyed the work in minutes, then began again. It took another three years to compose, then a year to edit the 656 pages.&quot;

Readings of &quot;The Rose of Paracelsus&quot; were presented at the University of Greenwich in London in June 2017. Readers included British artist and Resonance FM radio host Simon Tyszko, SEED Restaurant founder Greg Sams and post-doctoral fellow in literature Neşe Devenot. In November 2016, British actor Dudley Sutton did readings of &quot;The Rose of Paracelsus&quot; at Reading Gaol, in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s former cell. &quot;The Rose&quot; also has been reviewed by author and Psychedelic Museum founder Julian Vayne.

In November 2017, readings from &quot;The Rose&quot; were presented at the Altered Conference Berlin, and in December 2017 &quot;The Rose&quot; was discussed on the major podcast &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; with Duncan Trussell.

<doc id="578038" wikidata="Q3089249" url="?curid=578038" title="Reversal potential">
<text>In a biological membrane, the reversal potential is the membrane potential at which the direction of ionic current reverses. At the reversal potential, there is no net flow of ions from one side of the membrane to the other. For channels that are permeable to only a single type of ion, the reversal potential is identical to the equilibrium potential of the ion. 

==Equilibrium potential==
The equilibrium potential for an ion is the membrane potential at which there is no net movement of the ion. The flow of any inorganic ion, such as Na+ or K+, through an ion channel (since membranes are normally impermeable to ions) is driven by the electrochemical gradient for that ion. This gradient consists of two parts, the difference in the concentration of that ion across the membrane, and the voltage gradient. When these two influences balance each other, the electrochemical gradient for the ion is zero and there is no net flow of the ion through the channel; this also translates to no current across the membrane so long as only one ionic species is involved. The voltage gradient at which this equilibrium is reached is the equilibrium potential for the ion and it can be calculated from the Nernst equation. 

===Mathematical models and the driving force===
We can consider as an example a positively charged ion, such as K+, and a negatively charged membrane, as it is commonly the case in most organisms. The membrane voltage opposes the flow of the potassium ions out of the cell and the ions can leave the interior of the cell only if they have sufficient thermal energy to overcome the energy barrier produced by the negative membrane voltage. However, this biasing effect can be overcome by an opposing concentration gradient if the interior concentration is high enough which favours the potassium ions leaving the cell. 

An important concept related to the equilibrium potential is the driving force&quot;.&quot; Driving force is simply defined as the difference between the actual membrane potential and an ion&#x27;s equilibrium potential formula_1where formula_2refers to the equilibrium potential for a specific ion. Relatedly, the membrane current per unit area due to the type formula_3 ion channel is given by the following equation: 

:formula_4

where formula_1 is the driving force and formula_6 is the specific conductance, or conductance per unit area. Note that the ionic current will be zero if the membrane is impermeable to that ion in question or if the membrane voltage is exactly equal to the equilibrium potential of that ion.

==Use in research==
When Vm is at the reversal potential for an event such as a synaptic potential ( is equal to 0), the identity of the ions that flow during an EPC can be deduced by comparing the reversal potential of the EPC to the equilibrium potential for various ions. For instance several excitatory ionotropic ligand-gated neurotransmitter receptors including glutamate receptors (AMPA, NMDA, and kainate), nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), and serotonin (5-HT3) receptors are nonselective cation channels that pass Na+ and K+ in nearly equal proportions, giving the reversal potential close to zero. The inhibitory ionotropic ligand-gated neurotransmitter receptors that carry Cl−, such as GABAA and glycine receptors, have reversal potentials close to the resting potential (approximately –70 mV) in neurons.

This line of reasoning led to the development of experiments (by Akira Takeuchi and Noriko Takeuchi in 1960) that demonstrated that acetylcholine-activated ion channels are approximately equally permeable to Na+ and K+ ions. The experiment was performed by lowering the external Na+ concentration, which lowers (makes more negative) the Na+ equilibrium potential and produces a negative shift in reversal potential. Conversely, increasing the external K+ concentration raises (makes more positive) the K+ equilibrium potential and produces a positive shift in reversal potential. A general expression for reversal potential of synaptic events, including for decreases in conductance, has been derived.

<doc id="578040" wikidata="Q448942" url="?curid=578040" title="Clifford Cocks">
<text>Clifford Christopher Cocks (born 28 December 1950) is a British mathematician and cryptographer. In the early 1970s, while working at the United Kingdom Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), he developed an early public-key cryptography (PKC) system. This pre-dated commercial offerings, but due to the classified nature of Cocks&#x27; work, it did not become widely known until 1997 when the work was declassified. 

As his work was not available for public review until 1997, it had no impact on numerous commercial initiatives relating to Internet security that had been commercially developed and that were well established by 1997. His work was technically aligned with the Diffie–Hellman key exchange and elements of the RSA algorithm; these systems were independently developed and commercialized.

==Education==
Cocks was educated at Manchester Grammar School and went on to study the Mathematical Tripos as an undergraduate at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He continued as a PhD student at the University of Oxford, where he specialised in number theory under Bryan Birch, but left academia without finishing his doctorate.

==Career==

===Non-secret encryption===

Cocks left Oxford to join Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG), an arm of GCHQ, in September 1973. Soon after, Nick Patterson told Cocks about James H. Ellis&#x27; &quot;non-secret encryption,&quot; an idea which had been published in 1969 but never successfully implemented. Several people had attempted creating the required one-way functions, but Cocks, with his background in number theory, decided to use prime factorization, and did not even write it down at the time. With this insight, he quickly developed what later became known as the RSA encryption algorithm.

GCHQ was not able to find a way to use the algorithm, and treated it as classified information. The scheme was also passed to the NSA. With a military focus, financial considerations, and low computing power, the power of public-key cryptography was unrealised in both organisations:

I judged it most important for military use. In a fluid military situation you may meet unforeseen threats or opportunities. 
... if you can share your key rapidly and electronically, you have a major advantage over your opponent.
Only at the end of the evolution from Berners-Lee [in 1989] designing an open internet architecture for CERN, its adaptation and adoption for the Arpanet ... did public key cryptography realise its full potential.
-Ralph Benjamin
In 1977, the algorithm was independently invented and published by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman, who named it after their initials. There is no evidence of a hint or leak, conscious or unconscious, and Cocks has dismissed the idea. 
The British achievement remained secret until 1997.

===Public revelation===
In 1987, the GCHQ had plans to release the work, but Peter Wright&#x27;s &quot;Spycatcher&quot; MI5 memoir caused them to delay revealing the research by ten years.
24 years after its discovery, on 18 December 1997, Cocks revealed the GCHQ history of public-key research in a public talk. James Ellis had died on 25 November 1997, a month before the public announcement was made.

===Identity-based encryption===
In 2001, Cocks developed one of the first secure identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes, based on assumptions about quadratic residues in composite groups. The Cocks IBE scheme is not widely used in practice due to its high degree of ciphertext expansion. However, it is currently one of the few IBE schemes which do not use bilinear pairings, and rely for security on more well-studied mathematical problems.

===Awards and honours===
In 1968, Cocks won a silver medal at the 10th International Mathematical Olympiad.

Cocks held the post of Chief Mathematician at GCHQ. He established the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research at the University of Bristol.

Cocks was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 2008 (the citation describes him as &quot;Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office&quot;). He was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Bristol in 2008, and an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Birmingham in 2015.

With James Ellis and Malcolm Williamson, Cocks was honoured for his part in the development of public-key cryptography by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2010 and by induction into the Cryptologic Hall of Honor in 2021.

Cocks was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2015. His certificate of election reads:

<text>Scott A. Vanstone was a mathematician and cryptographer in the University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics. He was a member of the school&#x27;s Centre for Applied Cryptographic Research, and was also a founder of the cybersecurity company Certicom. He received his PhD in 1974 at the University of Waterloo, and for about a decade worked principally in combinatorial design theory, finite geometry, and finite fields. In the 1980s he started working in cryptography. An early result of Vanstone (joint with Ian Blake, R. Fuji-Hara, and Ron Mullin) was an improved algorithm for computing discrete logarithms in binary fields, which inspired Don Coppersmith to develop his famous exp(n^{1/3+ε}) algorithm (where n is the degree of the field).

Vanstone was one of the first to see the commercial potential of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and much of his subsequent work was devoted to developing ECC algorithms, protocols, and standards. In 1985 he co-founded Certicom, which later became the chief developer and promoter of ECC.

Vanstone authored or coauthored five widely used books and almost two hundred research articles, and he held several patents.
He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and a Fellow of the International Association for Cryptologic Research. In 2001 he won the RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics, and in 2009 he received the Ontario Premier&#x27;s Catalyst Award for Lifetime Achievement in Innovation.

He died on March 2, 2014, shortly after a cancer diagnosis.

<doc id="578052" wikidata="Q686493" url="?curid=578052" title="David Kahn (writer)">
<text>David Kahn (February 7, 1930 – January 23, 2024) was an American historian, journalist, and writer. He wrote extensively on the history of cryptography and military intelligence.

Kahn&#x27;s first published book, &quot;The Codebreakers - The Story of Secret Writing&quot; (1967), has been widely considered to be a definitive account of the history of cryptography.

== Biography ==
David Kahn was born in New York City to Florence Abraham Kahn, a glass manufacturer, and Jesse Kahn, a lawyer, and grew up in Great Neck, NY on Long Island.

Kahn said he traced his interest in cryptography to reading Fletcher Pratt&#x27;s &quot;Secret and Urgent&quot; (1939) as a boy. Kahn was a founding editor of the &quot;Cryptologia&quot; journal. In 1969, Kahn married Susanne Fiedler; they divorced in 1994. They have two sons, Oliver and Michael.

Kahn attended Bucknell University. After graduation, he worked as a reporter at &quot;Newsday&quot;. He also served as an editor at the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; in Paris in the 1960s.

It was during this period that he wrote an article for the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; about two defectors from the National Security Agency. It was the origin of his monumental book, &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;.

== &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; ==

&quot;The Codebreakers&quot; comprehensively chronicles the history of cryptography from ancient Egypt to the time of its writing. It is widely regarded as the best account of the history of cryptography up to its publication. Most of the editing, German translating, and insider contributions were from American World War II cryptographer Bradford Hardie III. William Crowell, the former deputy director of the National Security Agency, was quoted in Newsday as saying &quot;Before he (Kahn) came along, the best you could do was buy an explanatory book that usually was too technical and terribly dull.&quot;

Kahn, then a newspaper journalist, was contracted to write a book on cryptography in 1961. He began writing it part-time, at one point quitting his regular job to work on it full-time. The book was to include information on the National Security Agency (NSA), and according to author James Bamford writing in 1982, the agency attempted to stop its publication and considered publishing a negative review of Kahn&#x27;s work in the press to discredit him. A committee of the United States Intelligence Board concluded that the book was &quot;a possibly valuable support to foreign COMSEC [communications security] authorities&quot; and recommended &quot;further low-key actions as possible, but short of legal action, to discourage Mr. Kahn or his prospective publishers.&quot; Kahn&#x27;s publisher, the Macmillan company, handed over the manuscript to the federal government for review without Kahn&#x27;s permission on March 4, 1966. Kahn and Macmillan eventually agreed to remove some material from the manuscript, particularly concerning the relationship between the NSA and its British counterpart, the GCHQ, because Kahn felt pressured by the intelligence community.

&quot;The Codebreakers&quot; did not cover most of the history concerning the breaking of the German Enigma machine (which became public knowledge only in the 1970s). Nor did it cover the advent of strong cryptography in the public domain, beginning with the invention of public key cryptography and the specification of the Data Encryption Standard in the mid-1970s. An updated edition in 1996 included an additional chapter covering events since the original publication.

&quot;The Codebreakers&quot; was a finalist for the non-fiction Pulitzer Prize in 1968.

== Later career ==

Kahn was awarded a doctorate (D.Phil) from Oxford University in 1974, in modern German history under the supervision of the then Regius professor of modern history, Hugh Trevor-Roper.

Kahn continued his work as a reporter and op-ed editor for &quot;Newsday&quot; until 1998 and served as a journalism professor at New York University.

Despite past differences between Kahn and the National Security Agency over the information in &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;, Kahn was selected in 1995 to become NSA&#x27;s scholar-in-residence. On October 26, 2010, Kahn attended a ceremony at NSA&#x27;s National Cryptologic Museum (NCM) to commemorate his donation of his lifetime collection of cryptologic books, memorabilia, and artifacts to the museum and its library. The collection is housed at the NCM library and is non-circulating (that is, items cannot be checked out or loaned out), but photocopying and photography of items in the collection are allowed.

== Personal life and death ==
Kahn lived in New York City. He also lived in Washington, D.C.; Paris, France; Freiburg, Germany; Oxford, England; and Great Neck, New York. He died on January 23, 2024, at the age of 93, in the Bronx.

<text>Gordon Muriel Flowerdew (2 January 1885 – 31 March 1918) was an English-born Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, received for his actions at the Battle of Moreuil Wood.

==Early life==
He was born in Billingford, Norfolk, one of fourteen children of Arthur John Blomfield Flowerdew and Hannah Flowerdew (nee Symonds). He was educated at Framlingham College in Suffolk, as were all nine of his brothers. At the age of 18, after a bout of pleurisy, he emigrated to British Columbia, where he took up ranching, settling in Walhachin, a community known locally as &quot;little England&quot;.

==Military career==
When the First World War broke out in September 1914, he enlisted as a private in Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse. He rose quickly through the ranks and was commissioned as an officer in 1916. By January 1918, Flowerdew was given command of C Squadron of Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse.

For most of the war, the Canadian Cavalry Brigade was not involved in much direct fighting, because of the static nature of the trench warfare on the Western Front. However, when the Germans launched Operation Michael and began a rapid advance in the spring of 1918, cavalry again became an important factor. In late March, as the Germans approached Moreuil and threatened to cross the L&#x27;Avre River, the last natural barrier before Amiens, the Canadian Cavalry Corps was assigned the task of stopping them. As the Germans began to enter Moreuil Wood from the east, Lieutenant Flowerdew&#x27;s squadron rode around the wood and approached the Germans&#x27; flank from the north. Flowerdew&#x27;s commanding officer, Brigadier General Jack Seely, had ordered a cavalry charge.

Riding into the fire of five infantry companies and an artillery battery, the squadron suffered atrocious casualties (more than half of the men in C Squadron were killed), and Flowerdew himself was fatally wounded. However, the cavalry charge so unnerved the Germans that they were never able to capture Moreuil Wood, and their advance turned into a retreat in early April. His actions in &quot;The Last Great Cavalry Charge&quot; led to the award of the Victoria Cross. Flowerdew lived long enough to be made aware of the success of the charge. Seely wrote to his sister, referring to &quot;when your brave young brother met his death at the moment of victory to which he had contributed the largest share&quot;.

===Citation===


Flowerdew&#x27;s VC was one of twenty awarded during the battles of the German and Allied offensives in the Amiens area in 1918.

Alfred Munnings, who was then a largely unknown war artist, created an oil painting &quot;Charge of Flowerdew&#x27;s Squadron&quot; which depicts this cavalry charge. The canvas was formerly at the Imperial War Museum in London; it is now in the collection of the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa.

Flowerdew is buried at Namps-au-Val Cemetery in France located 11 miles south-east of Amiens (plot I, row H. grave 1).

==Legacy==
His posthumously awarded VC was donated by his mother to Framlingham College in England. It had been on loan to, and displayed by, Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians) at their gallery in The Military Museums in Calgary, Alberta, from 1990 to 2002. The medal was returned to the college in 2002, returning to be displayed on the 2018 Moreuil Wood Military Parade and commemoration.

Lieutenant Flowerdew is a character in the play &quot;Mary&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, by Canadian playwright Stephen Massicotte. The climax of the play takes place during the charge at Moreuil Wood.

<text>East Falkland () is the largest island of the Falklands in the South Atlantic, having an area of or 54% of the total area of the Falklands. The island consists of two main land masses, of which the more southerly is known as Lafonia; it is joined by a narrow isthmus where the settlement of Goose Green is located, and it was the scene of the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War.

The two main centres of population in the Falklands, Stanley and Mount Pleasant, which are both in the northern half of East Falkland, are home to three-quarters of the island&#x27;s population.

==Geography==

East Falkland, which has an area of , a little over half the total area of the islands consists of two land masses of approximately equal size. The island is almost bisected by two deep fjords, Choiseul Sound and Brenton Loch-Grantham Sound, which are separated by the wide isthmus that connects Lafonia in the south to the northern part of East Falkland. The island&#x27;s coastline has many smaller bays, inlets and headlands.

The northern part of the island, apart from the coastal strip bordering the Choiseul Sound, is largely underlain by Palaeozoic rocks in the form of quartzite and slate, which tend to form rugged landscapes and coastlines and to cause the soil to be poor and acidic. The principal range of hills, the Wickham Heights, runs from east to west. The highest point of the range (also the highest point in the Falklands) is Mount Usborne which has a height of . The area away from the mountain range consists chiefly of low undulating ground, a mixture of pasture and morass, with many shallow freshwater tarns, and small streams running in the valleys. Two inlets, Berkeley Sound and Port William, run far into the land at the north-eastern extremity of the island and provide anchorage for shipping.

In contrast, Lafonia is underlain by Mesozoic rocks (sandstone), a younger rock than the Palaeozoic rock to the north, giving a flatter landscape than is seen elsewhere on the island.

Other scenery includes Mount Simon, stone runs, heathland, and bogs. Gypsy Cove is noted as a beauty spot.

==Population and infrastructure==
Stanley, the capital of the islands and the main seaport is in East Falkland. The islands&#x27; (Anglican) Christ Church Cathedral is also in Stanley.

Port Louis, at the head of Berkeley Sound, was once the seat of government. However, the anchorage there was found to be rather too exposed, and about 1844 a town was laid out, and the necessary public buildings were erected, on Stanley Harbour, a sheltered recess within Port William.

Other settlements include Port Louis, Darwin, Port San Carlos, San Carlos, Salvador, Johnson&#x27;s Harbour, Fitzroy, Mare Harbour, and Goose Green.

East Falkland also has two airports with paved runways, Port Stanley Airport and RAF Mount Pleasant. There is a lighthouse at Cape Pembroke near Stanley. East Falkland contains most of the archipelago&#x27;s few roads.

==Economy==

The main industries on the island are fishing, sheep farming, and tourism. Some oats are also grown, but due to high humidity and acidic soil, the land is mainly used for grazing.

As Stanley is the capital, and East Falkland is the most populous island, it performs an economic role as the hub of the archipelago. Many cruise ships now stop there.

A large economic role is also played by RAF Mount Pleasant, which has a number of British military personnel based there. Although these number a few hundred, their economic role in a population of under two thousand is significant.

Smaller industries include horse and cattle farming, and there is also recent evidence to suggest possible valuable mineral deposits on the island.

==Wildlife==

Due to more intensive human settlement, East Falkland has the corresponding conservation problems. The warrah was one of the first casualties, as Darwin says in &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;:

:&quot;The only quadruped native to the island is a large wolf-like fox (Canis antarcticus), which is common to both East and West Falkland. I have no doubt it is a peculiar species... Their numbers have rapidly decreased; they are already banished from that half of the island which lies to the eastward of the neck of land between St. Salvador Bay and Berkeley Sound. Within a very few years after these islands shall have become regularly settled, in all probability this fox will be classed with the dodo, as an animal which has perished from the face of the earth.&quot;

Rats have also been introduced, but despite this, the island has a great deal of marine life, including penguins of various kinds.

Guanacos were unsuccessfully introduced in 1862 to East Falkland south of Mt Pleasant where Prince Alfred hunted them in 1871. They have since become extinct, but are still on Staats Island

Charles Darwin surveyed the area&#x27;s wildlife, while on .

==History==


The first permanent settlement on East Falkland began with Louis de Bougainville establishing Port Louis on Berkeley Sound in 1764. The French settlement included a number of Bretons, and the islands became known as &quot;Îles Malouines&quot; (the islands of St Malo), later Hispanicised as &quot;Islas Malvinas&quot;. For years, Port Louis was the main settlement, not only on East Falkland, but the entire archipelago and a subject of controversy.

In October 1820, Colonel David Jewett sought shelter in the islands after his ship, the frigate &quot;Heroina&quot;, was damaged in a storm. Jewett was an American privateer employed as captain by the Buenos Aires businessman Patrick Lynch, who had obtained a privateering licence for the ship from the Buenos Aires Supreme Director. Jose Rondeau. On 6 November 1820 he raised the flag of the United Provinces of the River Plate at Port Louis and claimed possession of the entire archipelago in the name of the United Provinces of the South (which later became the United Provinces of The River Plate and ultimately Argentina). Eyewitnesses present, such as James Weddell, felt the ceremony was designed simply to establish a salvage claim over a French wreck.

In 1823, Argentina granted fishing rights to Jorge Pacheco and Luis Vernet. Their first expedition to the islands ended in failure and Pacheco abandoned the venture. Vernet persisted with a second expedition in 1826. also ending in failure due to the combination of the Brazilian blockade of Argentina and the conditions encountered. Vernet finally succeeded in establishing a settlement at Puerto Soledad in 1828. Prior to both expeditions, Vernet had approached the British consulate in Buenos Aires, seeking permission for his venture in the islands. Subsequently, Vernet furnished the consulate with progress reports and urged the establishment of a permanent British garrison in the islands.

In 1829, Vernet approached the Government of Buenos Aires requesting the settlement be supported by a naval vessel. The request was refused, and instead Vernet was proclaimed to be Governor and authorised to act using his own resources. The British consul lodged a formal protest over the proclamation, which went unanswered. Vernet assured the British consul that his interest was purely commercial and once more urged the British to establish a permanent presence in the islands. Vernet was the first person to be proclaimed Governor, although modern Argentine texts claim the captains of the Heroina and Pachego as &quot;governors&quot;.

&quot;Puerto Luis&quot;, as it was renamed, became a seal hunting base and small fishing port. Vernet later seized an American ship, the &quot;Harriet&quot;, for breaking a monopoly he had proclaimed on seal hunting, one not recognised by either the American or British Governments. (Both formally disputed the restrictions through their consuls in Buenos Aires.) Property on board the ship was seized and the captain was sent to Buenos Aires to stand trial. Vernet accompanied him. The American Consul in Argentina strongly protested Vernet&#x27;s actions, stating the United States did not recognise Argentine sovereignty over the Falklands.

The American consul dispatched the USS &quot;Lexington&quot; to Puerto Luis to retake the confiscated property, as well as the ships &quot;Superior&quot; and &quot;Breakwater&quot;, which had also been seized. In 1832, the attacked Puerto Luis, an act which was later condoned by the American ambassador in Buenos Aires, who declared the Falkland Islands to be free from any ruling power. Modern Argentina claims the Americans destroyed the settlement, but Captain Duncan&#x27;s log tells of only spiking the cannons and destroying the powder store. Duncan arrested the seven senior members of Vernet&#x27;s settlement for piracy and provided transport to Montevideo for any member of the settlement who wished to leave. The majority of the population decided to leave, claiming Vernet had misled them about the miserable conditions in the islands. Following these events, Vernet resigned as Governor. The Argentine Government then appointed Esteban José Francisco Mestivier as governor, and sought to establish a penal colony in the islands. (Mestivier&#x27;s appointment was in fact the only Argentine appointment to follow the norms of the time and was properly gazetted.). Shortly after his arrival, however, Mestivier was murdered by his own men and the settlement was in chaos.

These events spurred Britain to return to the islands, (&quot;See Re-establishment of British rule on the Falklands (1833)&quot;), requesting that the Argentine military presence leave on 3 January 1833 (though remaining members of the settlement were encouraged to stay). &quot;Puerto Luis&quot; was renamed &quot;Ansons Harbour&quot;, but reverted to &quot;Port Louis&quot; in line with the original French name of the settlement Port Saint Louis. It became both a naval garrison and civilian settlement.

Shortly after this, the second voyage of HMS Beagle surveyed the island. The names of two settlements on East Falkland, Darwin and Fitzroy, commemorate Charles Darwin and Robert FitzRoy. On 15 March 1833, an unimpressed Darwin wrote

:&quot;After the possession of these miserable islands had been contested by France, Spain, and England, they were left uninhabited. The government of Buenos Aires then sold them to a private individual, but likewise used them, as old Spain had done before, for a penal settlement. England claimed her right and seized them. The Englishman who was left in charge of the flag was consequently murdered. A British officer was next sent, unsupported by any power: and when we arrived, we found him in charge of a population, of which rather more than half were runaway rebels and murderers.&quot; (&quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;.)

In November 1836, the island was surveyed by Admiral George Grey, and further in 1837 by Lowcay. Admiral Grey described their first view of East Falkland –

:&quot;We anchored a little after sunset off a creek called &#x27;Johnson&#x27;s Harbour&#x27;. The day having been cloudy with occasional showers, these islands at all times dreary enough, looked particularly so on our first view of them, the shores of sound, steep, with bare hills intersected with ravines rising from them, these hills without a tree and the clouds hanging low, gave them exactly the appearance of the Cheviots or a Scotch moor on a winter&#x27;s day and considering we were in the May of these latitudes, the first impression of the climate was not favourable, the weather however, was not cold, the thermometer was 63 degrees which is Howick mid-summer temperature.&quot;

In 1845 Samuel Fisher Lafone, a wealthy cattle and hide merchant from Montevideo, obtained a grant of the southern portion of the East Falkland from the British government. He purchased the peninsula, in extent, together with all the wild cattle on East Falkland, for a period of six years, for the sum of £10,000 down, and £20,000 in ten years from 1 January 1852. In 1851 the Falkland Islands Company, which had been incorporated by charter in the same year, paid £30,000 for Lafone&#x27;s interest in Lafonia, as the peninsula came to be called. Lafone had never even visited the islands. The only remaining signs of this venture are the ruins at Hope Place and the stone corral at Darwin.

In 1859, the town of Darwin was founded.

Although used for sheep farming since the early nineteenth century, East Falkland was dominated by cattle farming until the 1850s.

In 1925 the Bodie Suspension Bridge was built across a creek in Lafonia, and is claimed to be the southernmost in the world. It is still in pedestrian use today.

===1982 invasion and Falklands War===

In April 1982, East Falkland was invaded by Argentina. The Governor, Rex Hunt, was informed by the British Government of a possible Argentinian invasion on Wednesday 31 March. Hunt summoned the two senior Royal Marines officers of Naval Party 8901 to Government House in Stanley to discuss how to defend the Falklands. Major Mike Norman was given overall command of the Marines because of his seniority, while Major Gary Noott became Hunt&#x27;s military advisor. The total strength was only 68 Marines and 11 sailors, which nevertheless was more than would normally have been available, since the garrison was in the process of changing over. Their numbers were reinforced by 25 Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF) members. The FIDF commanding officer, Major Phil Sommers, tasked the volunteer militiamen with guarding key points including the telephone exchange, the radio station and the power station. Jack Solis, commanding the civilian coastal ship &quot;Forrest&quot;, operated his vessel as an improvised radar screen station off Stanley.
East Falkland was also the location of the bulk of the land-based action in the Falklands War. As a result, some areas of the &quot;Camp&quot; in East Falkland were still heavily mined until 2020, when all de-mining was completed in the Falkland Islands. Areas that saw intensive combat included Goose Green, San Carlos, Mount Longdon and the Two Sisters ridge.

==Present day==

Following the Falklands War, Britain increased its military presence on the East Falkland. The Falkland Islands Government has invested heavily in improving facilities in Stanley and transportation around the islands, tarmacking many roads. The population has risen, because of the growth of Stanley, but has declined in the Camp. Most of the improvements in the islands have taken place on East Falkland.

<doc id="578057" wikidata="Q1561052" url="?curid=578057" title="Tollmann's bolide hypothesis">
<text>Tollmann&#x27;s bolide hypothesis is a hypothesis presented by Austrian palaeontologist Edith Kristan-Tollmann and geologist Alexander Tollmann in 1994. The hypothesis postulates that one or several bolides (asteroids or comets) struck the Earth around 7640 ± 200 years BCE, and a much smaller one approximately 3150 ± 200 BCE. The hypothesis tries to explain early Holocene extinctions and possibly legends of the Universal Deluge.

The claimed evidence for the event includes stratigraphic studies of tektites, dendrochronology, and ice cores (from Camp Century, Greenland) containing hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid (indicating an energetic ocean strike) as well as nitric acids (caused by extreme heating of air).

Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas in their book, &quot;Uriel&#x27;s Machine&quot;, argue that the 7640 BCE evidence is consistent with the dates of formation of a number of extant salt flats and lakes in dry areas of North America and Asia. They argue that these lakes are the remains of multiple-kilometer-high waves that penetrated deeply into continents as the result of oceanic strikes that they proposed occurred. Research by Quaternary geologists, palynologists, and others has been unable to confirm the validity of the hypothesis and proposes more frequently occurring geological processes for some of the data used for the hypothesis. The dating of ice cores and Australasian tektites has shown long time span differences between the proposed impact times and the impact ejecta products.

== Scientific evaluation ==
Quaternary geologists, paleoclimatologists, and planetary geologists specialising in meteorite and comet impacts have rejected Tollmann&#x27;s bolide hypothesis. They reject this hypothesis because:

# The evidence offered to support the hypothesis can more readily be explained by more mundane and less dramatic geologic processes
# Many of the events alleged to be associated with this impact occurred at the wrong time (i.e., many of the events occurred hundreds to thousands of years before or after the hypothesized impacts); and
# There is a lack of any credible physical evidence for the cataclysmic environmental devastation and characteristic deposits that kilometre-high tsunamis would have created had they actually occurred.
Evidence used by proponents of the Tollmann&#x27;s bolide hypothesis to argue for catastrophic Holocene extinctions have alternative explanations by more frequently occurring geological processes. The chemical composition and presence of volcanic ash with the specific acidity spikes in the Greenland ice cores shows evidence that they result from volcanic instead of impact origins. Also, the largest acidity spikes found in Antarctica ice cores have been dated to 17,300 to 17,500 BP, which is significantly older than hypothetical Holocene impacts. The formation of modern salt lakes and salt flats is explained by the concentration of salts and other evaporite minerals by the evaporation of water from stream-fed lakes lacking external outlets, called endorheic lakes, which commonly occur in arid climates on both hemispheres on Earth. The composition of the salts and other evaporite minerals found in these lakes is consistent with their precipitation from dissolved material continually carried into the lakes by rivers and streams and subsequent concentration by evaporation, instead of evaporation of seawater. Whether a lake becomes salty or not depends on whether the lake lacks an outlet and the relative balance between the inflow and outflow of lake waters via evaporation. Ocean water accessing a continental lake as the result of a single catastrophic event, as Tollmann&#x27;s hypothesis proposes, would contain an inadequate amount of dissolved minerals to produce, when evaporated, the vast quantities of salts and other evaporites found in the salt lakes, flats, and pans cited as evidence of a mega-tsunami by this hypothesis.

== Geological criticism ==
=== Isostatic rebound ===

Many published papers demonstrate that isostatic depression of the Earth&#x27;s crust happened in the early Holocene. This process has led to submerging substantial portions of coastal areas adjacent to continental ice sheets and resulted in the accumulations of marine sediments and fossils within them. A well-documented example of flooding caused by isostatic depression is the case of Charlotte, The Vermont Whale, a fossil whale found in the deposits of the former Champlain Sea. Like many similar marine deposits, the sediments, which accumulated within the Champlain Sea lack the physical characteristics; i.e. sedimentary structures, interlayers, and textures, that characterise sediments deposited by a mega-tsunami. These deposits and the associated fossils have been dated to significantly earlier periods than the times the bolide hypothesis proposed. In the case of the Champlain Sea, its sediments started to accumulate around 13,000 BP, almost 3,400 years before the oldest of the hypothesized Holocene bolide impacts.

=== Dating ===

A significant amount of the physical evidence used by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann, as supporting their hypothesis, is either too old or too young to have been created by this hypothesized impact. In many cases, it is hundreds to thousands, and in one case hundreds of thousands, of years too old to be credible evidence of a Holocene impact. The research that dates the tektites, which Tollmann&#x27;s bolide hypothesis regards as indicative of the timing of the impact, is outdated. Later research, has dated the Australasian tektites to the Middle Pleistocene; about 790,000 years BP. In addition, the formation of salt lakes and salt flats is neither synchronous nor consistent with the hypothesized impacts having occurred about either 9,640 BP or 5,150 BP. For example, in the case of Lake Bonneville, Lake Lahontan, Mono Lake, and other Pleistocene pluvial lakes in the western United States, the transition to salt lakes and salt flats occurred at different times between 12,000 and 16,000 BP. Thus, the change from freshwater to salty water and eventually salt flats started over 2,400 to 6,400 years before the oldest of the impacts hypothesized by the Tollmann bolide hypothesis occurred. As a result, it is impossible that the formation of these salt lakes could have been associated with the impact hypothesized by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann.

== Megatsunami ==

There exists a lack of credible physical evidence of either multiple-kilometer-high tsunami waves penetrating deeply into continents, and the ecological devastation these would have caused. Thousands of paleoenvironmental records constructed from the study of lakes, bogs, mires, and river valleys all over the world by palynologists have not shown the existence of such a megatsunami. In the case of North America, research published by various authors provides detailed records of paleoenvironmental changes that have occurred throughout the last 10,000 to 15,000 years as reconstructed from pollen and other paleoenvironmental data from over a thousand sites throughout North America. These records do not recognise indications of either a resulting catastrophic environmental devastation or layers of tsunami deposits, which the mega-tsunamis postulated by Tollmann&#x27;s bolide hypothesis would have created. Paleovegetation maps illustrate a distinct lack of the dramatic changes in North American paleovegetation during the Holocene, which would be expected from the cataclysmic ecological and physical destruction that a continent-wide mega-tsunamis would certainly have caused.

Grimm et al. in a paper published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1993, documented a 50,000-year-long record of environmental change by the analysis of pollen from an core from Lake Tulane in Highland county, Florida. Because of the low-lying nature of the peninsula, in which this part of Florida lies, this lake and the area around it would have been flooded and covered by tsunami deposits along with many of the other lakes and bogs described in there, and other publications. The forests and associated ecosystems of these areas would have been flooded and completely destroyed by the mega-tsunamis proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann. Despite its location, both the core and the pollen record recovered from Lake Tulane lacks any indication of an abrupt, catastrophic environmental disruption, which the mega-tsunamis proposed by Tollmann&#x27;s bolide hypothesis would have caused. Sedimentary cores obtained from Florida and other locations also lack sedimentary layers that have the characteristics of sediments deposited by either tsunamis or mega-tsunamis.

The cataclysmic scale of physical and ecological destruction that a megatsunami, like the one proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann, would have caused, has not been recognised within the majority of long-term environmental records. Over a thousand cores from North America for which Holocene paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental records have been reconstructed do not show evidence for the drastic environmental changes resulting from a large Holocene impact. There is a similar lack of evidence for mega-tsunami-related, Holocene, catastrophic environmental disruptions, and deposits reported from environmental records reconstructed from thousands of locations from all over the world. Other megatsunamis have been shown in coastal sediments analysed by geologists and palynologists and point to tsunamis locally caused by either earthquake, volcanic eruptions, or submarine slides. These non-impact related tsunamis show abundant records of their environmental effects through the study of pollen from cores and exposures.

Members of the Holocene Impact Working Group have published papers advocating the occurrence of mega-tsunamis created by extraterrestrial impacts at various times during the Holocene and Late Pleistocene. However, none of these proposed impacts match either the cataclysmic scale or timing proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann for their hypothesized bolide.

<doc id="578059" wikidata="Q7382251" url="?curid=578059" title="Russian postmodernism">
<text>Russian postmodernism refers to the cultural, artistic, and philosophical condition in Russia since the downfall of the Soviet Union and dialectical materialism. With respect to statements about post-Soviet philosophy or sociology, the term is primarily used by non-Russians to describe the state of economic and political uncertainty they observe since the fall of communism and the way this uncertainty affects Russian identity. &#x27;Postmodernism&#x27; is, however, a term often used by Russian critics to describe contemporary Russian art and literature.

==Artistic and literary origins==
In art, postmodernism entered the Soviet Union in the 1950s after the end of the Stalinist move toward liberalization with the advent of the Russian conceptualist movement. Beginning as an underground political-artistic move against the use of Socialist realism as a method of social control and becoming a full-fledged movement with the Moscow Conceptualists, Russian conceptualism used the symbolism of Socialist realism against the Soviet government. Its representatives were artists Ilya Kabakov, Irina Nakhova, Viktor Pivovarov, Eric Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrski, Komar and Melamid, poets , Dmitri Prigov, Lev Rubinstein, Timur Kibirov, and writer Vladimir Sorokin.

The members of Lianozovo Group formed in 1958 and named after the small village Lianozovo outside Moscow, were its leader, the artist and poet , the artists , Oscar Rabin, Lidia Masterkova, Vladimir Nemukhin, Nikolai Vechtomov, and the poets Igor Kholin, Vsevolod Nekrasov, and Genrikh Sapgir.

The Metarealists, namely metaphysical realists, in the 1970s–90s unofficial postmodern Soviet and Russian poetry, who all used complex metaphors which they called meta-metaphors. Their representatives are Konstantin Kedrov, Elena Katsyuba, Elena Shvarts, Ivan Zhdanov, Vladimir Aristov, Aleksandr Yeryomenko, Yuri Arabov, and Alexei Parshchikov.

<doc id="578077" wikidata="Q6530268" url="?curid=578077" title="Lesbian until graduation">
<text>The LGBT slang terms lesbian until graduation (LUG), gay until graduation (GUG), and bisexual until graduation (BUG) are used to describe primarily women of high school or college age who are assumed to be experimenting with or adopting a temporary lesbian or bisexual identity, but who will ultimately adopt a heterosexual identity.

== Usage ==
In a 1999 article in the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;, A. Davis related her experimentation with same-sex relationships, and how as a result, she experienced hostility from lesbian friends who pressured her to identify as a bisexual, including one friend who urged her to do so as a political statement, despite the fact that Davis identifies as a heterosexual who merely experimented with women for a brief period. Davis said that women who experienced same-sex relationships are more attuned to LGBT issues, and more likely to oppose discrimination. She also said that if the same degree of acceptance were extended to men who experimented with homosexuality, it would promote greater acceptance of the LGBT community.

<doc id="578087" wikidata="Q7640954" url="?curid=578087" title="Sunol Regional Wilderness">
<text>The Sunol Regional Wilderness is a regional park in Alameda County, the eastern San Francisco Bay Area, Northern California. It is located near the town of Sunol, south of Pleasanton and east of Fremont.

The park was established in 1962, and is administered by the East Bay Regional Park District. The park is subject to either closure or fire restriction during the wildfire season from June through October.

==Natural history==
The park is in the inner California Coast Ranges. It originally was inhabited by Native Americans, and was subsequently primarily ranch land, with chaparral, oak woodland, and grassland habitats.

Grazing rights within the park are still leased, so cattle may be encountered.

===Flora===

Common trees in the park include Coast live oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;), Valley oak (&quot;Quercus lobata&quot;), Blue oak (&quot;Quercus douglasii&quot;), Mexican elderberry (&quot;Sambucus cerulea&quot;), Pacific Madrone (&quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot;) and Gray pine (&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;). Along Alameda Creek, riparian trees include White alder (&quot;Alnus rhombifolia&quot;), willow species, and California sycamore (&quot;Platanus racemosa&quot;).

In spring, wildflowers are abundant, including Chinese Houses, Ranunculus, monkeyflowers, California Poppy, goldfields, and several species of Lupines.

===Fauna===

There are many bird species, including one of the largest breeding populations of golden eagles, supported by large numbers of a common prey and keystone species, the California ground squirrel. skunks and black-tailed deer are also common. Coyotes and mountain lions visit the park, though they are unlikely to be seen by visitors. A well-equipped Visitors&#x27; Center has a complete list of plants and birds to be seen in the park. Common amphibians and reptiles include the California red-legged frog, Pacific tree frog, California newt, Diablo Range garter snake, Western rattlesnake and San Francisco alligator lizard.

==Features==
Trails for hiking, horse-riding, and mountain biking cross the park. There are also facilities for camping.

The Cave Rocks formation is popular for rock climbing.

===Ohlone Wilderness trail===

The Ohlone Wilderness trail, a long distance footpath linking several East Bay regional parks, passes through the Sunol Regional Wilderness. It runs from Mission Peak Regional Preserve near Fremont to the Del Valle Regional Park near Livermore. Several backpack campgrounds exist along the way.

Much of the routes land is owned by the San Francisco Water Department. Right to pass is subject to a permit, which is available at the Sunol Wilderness entrance gate.

The terrain between Sunol Wilderness and Del Valle Park can be challenging. Rose Peak is the high point, only a bit lower than Mount Diablo in elevation.

<doc id="578090" wikidata="Q1752043" url="?curid=578090" title="King Saud University">
<text>King Saud University (KSU, ) is a public university in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Established in 1957 by King Saud bin Abdulalziz to address the country&#x27;s skilled worker shortage, it is the first university in Saudi Arabia. It was known as Riyadh University from 1964 until it was reverted to its inceptive name in 1982. It was converted into an independent non-profit academic institution in 2023.

The student body of KSU today consists of 40,000 male and female students, 7% of which are international. The female students have their own disciplinary panel, and there is a center supervising the progress of female students, either personally by female faculty members or by male faculty members via a closed television network. The university offers courses in the natural sciences, the humanities, and professional studies, and many courses are tuition-free. The medium of instruction in undergraduate programs is English and Arabic depending on the chosen major.

==History==
Establishing Saudi Arabia&#x27;s first university was a response to the educational and professional needs of a young nation. King Abdulaziz became king in 1932, and began laying the foundations for modernizing his country and establishing an educational system. In 1953 King Saud, the eldest son of Abdulaziz, acceded to the throne upon his father&#x27;s death, and instituted the Council of Ministers and the Ministry Education.

Prince Fahd, who eventually became the Saudi king, was the first minister of education. Following the first session of the Council of Ministers, he announced that the first Saudi university would be established as a house of culture and sciences. Prince Fahd said that he was committed to promoting higher education.

In 1957, according to the dictates of the Royal Decree No. 17, Prince Fahd announced the founding of King Saud University, established to &quot;Disseminate and promote knowledge in Our Kingdom for widening the base of scientific and literary study, and for keeping abreast with other nations in the arts and sciences and for contributing with them discovery and invention, in addition to reviving Islamic civilization and articulate its benefits and glories, along with its ambitions to nurture the young virtuously and to guarantee their healthy minds and ethics.&quot;

Students began studying at the College of Arts in the 1957–58 academic year. Since then KSU developed further according to the needs of the nation.

Between 1958 and 1960 the College of Sciences, the College of Business (now the College of Public Administration) and the College of Pharmacy were established.

Royal Decree no. 112 of 1961 recognized that King Saud University was an independent legal entity, with a budget of its own, responsible for higher education, promoting scholarly research, and advancement of sciences and arts in the country. Naming the minister of education as the president of the university, the statute ordered that the university have a vice president and secretary general, and that each college and institute have a dean, vice dean, and a council.

In 1965 the College of Agriculture was established and KSU assumed control over the Colleges of Engineering and Education, formerly under the Ministry of Education in cooperation with UNESCO.

=== Riyadh University ===
Royal Decree no. M/11 of 1967 enforced the Statute of the University of Riyadh (currently King Saud University), rescinding all earlier statutes, bylaws, and regulations. Of the main landmarks of the new statute is the creation of the Higher Council of the university as one of its administrative powers. The membership of the new council includes two active or inactive university presidents, two faculty members who had assumed such positions outside the country, or two native leading intellectuals.

The Higher Council of the university is the dominant power over the university affairs: it draws out policies, issues decisions to implement and achieve the objectives of the university (especially those pertaining to the creation of new colleges and departments), proposes budgets, and systems of faculty salaries, annuities, and financial awards.

Royal Decree no M/6 of 1972 superseded the statute of 1967. With the new statute, the membership of the Higher Council of the university includes five active or inactive university presidents, or native leading intellectuals. To the council are also added the university secretary general and two other non-university members. Again, the statute dictates the creation of an Academic Council overlooking scholarly research and studies. The Higher Council of the university issues the bylaws governing the number of the Academic Council&#x27;s members, responsibilities, and powers.

These decrees were issued in response to the growing and widening needs of the university as the establishment of new colleges started. Between 1958 and 1960, three colleges were established: the College of Sciences, College of Business (now the College of Public Administration) and the College of Pharmacy. In 1961/1962 women were first admitted into the College of Arts and the College of Public Administration.

Five years later the College of Agriculture was established. In the same year the College of Engineering and College of Education, having been under the Ministry of Education in cooperation with the UNESCO, were annexed to the university. A year later (1969/1970) the College of Medicine opened. In 1974/1975 the Arabic Language Institute was inaugurated to serve non-Arabic speakers. At this time deanships of Admission and Registration, Students Affairs, Libraries were also established. Again, a year later (1976) the College of Dentistry and the College of Applied Medical Sciences were added to the Riyadh campus, while launching at the same time the Abha-based campus with the College of Education. In 1977, the Graduate College assumed its office in supervising and organizing all graduate programs in the various departments of the university.

At Abha, the College of Medicine was established according to Royal Order no. 3/M/380 of 1979 and was added to the university according to Royal Directive no. 15128 of 29 June 1400H. Formal study there started in the academic year of 1980/1981.

In 1980 another branch of the university opened at Qassim with three colleges: Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, and Economics and Administration. Formal study started in 1980/1981 academic year.

=== King Saud University ===

In 1982, celebrating its 25th anniversary, the University of Riyadh went back to its original name of King Saud University at the orders of King Khalid bin Abdulaziz. In that year, too, the Deanship of Community Service and Continuing Education replaced the Center for Community Service, and King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) was formally opened.

Two years later (1983) two other colleges were created: the College of Computer and Information Science Sciences and the College of Architecture and Planning. Later, in 1990, the Institute of Languages and Translation was established to be turned four years later into the full-fledged College of Languages and Translation.

In 1993, the royal ratification of the System of the Council of Higher Education and Universities was issued dictating that each university form its own council which attends to its academic, administrative, and financial affairs, and carries out its general policy.

In 1996, the Council of Higher Education issued its decision no. 1282/A approving the creation of the Center for Consulting and Research which was renamed King Abdullah Center for Consulting and Research.

In 1997, Royal Decree no. 33 dictated the creation of a King Saud University Community College in Jazan, as well as the establishment of the College of Sciences at the Qassim campus.

In 1998, Royal Order no. 7/78/M of 11 March 1419 decreed that King Khalid University be created in the south. The branches of Imam University and of King Saud University consequently formed the new university. In the same year, after the issuance of the unified regulations for Graduate Studies at Saudi universities, the Graduate College became the Deanship of Graduate Studies, and the Deanship of Academic Research was established in accordance with the dictates of the System of Academic Research issued that year.

In 2000, the College of Medicine was established at the Qassim campus, and the Deanship of Community Service and Continuing Education was turned into the College of Applied Studies and Community Service.

In 2001, the Community College in Riyadh was inaugurated according to the Cabinet Council no. 73. During the academic year of 2002/2003 the College of Science at Al-Jouf was established. That same year the College of Engineering was opened at the Qassim campus, and the creation of community colleges at Al-Majma’ah, Al-Aflaj, and Al-Qurayat was approved.

Beginning with the academic year 2003/2004 the Qassim campus became an independent university. In 2003, the Council of Higher Education approved the promotion of the Department of Nursing, College of Applied Medical Sciences, into the College of Nursing.

=== Former rectors ===
The following individuals have served as the rectors of the university since its inception:

== Campus ==
The school&#x27;s current main campus was designed by HOK Architects, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Mechanical and Electrical systems were designed by Syska Hennessy Group, Inc. New York City, New York. The facility was constructed in the 1980s by Blount International, a construction firm led by Winton M. Blount headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama, after the firm was awarded the world&#x27;s then-largest fixed-price contract in history for the sum of approximately $5 billion.

=== Libraries ===
The King Salman Central library is housed in a seven-floor building, with an area of and more than 4,000 seats, has collections of books, periodicals, manuscripts, government publications, academic theses, dissertations, press clippings, audio-visual and electronic media.

=== King Khalid University Hospital ===

In 1982, a dedicated university hospital was opened and was named King Khalid University Hospital. This facility is an 850-bed facility with all general and subspecialty medical services. It contains a special outpatient building, more than 20 operating rooms, and a fully equipped and staffed laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy services in addition to all other supporting services.

The hospital provides primary and secondary care services for Saudi patients from Northern Riyadh area. It also provides tertiary care services to all Saudi citizens on referral bases. All care is free of charge for all King Saud University staff and students.

=== The Palm Mosque (Jama’a Al-Naqheel) ===

In 1982, Dr. Basil Al Bayati won the 1st prize in the King Saud Competition to build the main mosque for the university. His design incorporated extensively the motif of the palm trunk, as used in the very first Mosque of the Prophet in Medina. It was highly praised and was even claimed to &quot;mark the beginning of a new era, a new revival in Islamic architecture.&quot; The interior calligraphy above the doors and in the mihrab was done by Ghani Alani, the last of the Baghdad School of Calligraphy. He was a student of Hashem al-Khattat. Ghani Alani taught Dr. Bayati whilst at the College of Engineering in Baghdad. The building was also nominated for the 1992 Aga Khan Award for Architecture.

=== University Entrance Gate (Faith &amp; Knowledge) ===

As well as designing the mosque, Basil Al Bayati also designed the entrance gates to the university which are based upon the theme of faith and knowledge; two pillars of Islam that must be taken together, &quot;Knowledge cannot do without faith nor can faith ignore knowledge for Islam calls always for faith and knowledge to run in parallel.&quot; &quot;The design consists of two books representing knowledge and faith. They have been so placed so that their pages are interlocked thus showing the close connection between faith and knowledge. Verses from the Quran on faith and knowledge are written in script on the cover of each book.&quot;

== Academics ==
The university offers a broad range of undergraduate courses in the natural sciences, the social sciences, the humanities and professional studies. Tuition is completely free and generous scholarships are available for Saudi and international students. The medium of instruction in undergraduate programs is English and Arabic. Applicants are required to pass an Arabic examination if they are from a non-Arabic speaking country. English-language support at all levels is provided by the Languages Unit.

<doc id="578092" wikidata="Q1414155" url="?curid=578092" title="Key exchange">
<text>Key exchange (also key establishment) is a method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic algorithm.
If the sender and receiver wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be sent and decrypt messages received. The nature of the equipping they require depends on the encryption technique they might use. If they use a code, both will require a copy of the same codebook. If they use a cipher, they will need appropriate keys. If the cipher is a symmetric key cipher, both will need a copy of the same key. If it is an asymmetric key cipher with the public/private key property, both will need the other&#x27;s public key.

==Channel of exchange==
Key exchange is done either in-band or out-of-band.

==The key exchange problem==
The key exchange problem describes ways to exchange whatever keys or other information are needed for establishing a secure communication channel so that no one else can obtain a copy. Historically, before the invention of public-key cryptography (asymmetrical cryptography), symmetric-key cryptography utilized a single key to encrypt and decrypt messages. For two parties to communicate confidentially, they must first exchange the secret key so that each party is able to encrypt messages before sending, and decrypt received ones. This process is known as the key exchange.

The overarching problem with symmetrical cryptography, or single-key cryptography, is that it requires a secret key to be communicated through trusted couriers, diplomatic bags, or any other secure communication channel. If two parties cannot establish a secure initial key exchange, they won&#x27;t be able to communicate securely without the risk of messages being intercepted and decrypted by a third party who acquired the key during the initial key exchange.

Public-key cryptography uses a two-key system, consisting of the public and the private keys, where messages are encrypted with one key and decrypted with another. It depends on the selected cryptographic algorithm which key—public or private—is used for encrypting messages, and which for decrypting. For example, in RSA, the private key is used for decrypting messages, while in the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), the private key is used for authenticating them. The public key can be sent over non-secure channels or shared in public; the private key is only available to its owner.

Known as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the encryption key can be openly communicated as it poses no risk to the confidentiality of encrypted messages. One party exchanges the keys to another party where they can then encrypt messages using the key and send back the cipher text. Only the decryption key—in this case, it&#x27;s the private key—can decrypt that message. At no time during the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is any sensitive information at risk of compromise, as opposed to symmetrical key exchange.

===Identification===
In principle, the only remaining problem was to be sure (or at least confident) that a public key actually belonged to its supposed owner. Because it is possible to &#x27;spoof&#x27; another&#x27;s identity in any of several ways, this is not a trivial or easily solved problem, particularly when the two users involved have never met and know nothing about each other.

===Diffie–Hellman key exchange ===
In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a cryptographic protocol called the Diffie–Hellman key exchange (D–H) based on concepts developed by Hellman&#x27;s PhD student Ralph Merkle. The protocol enables users to securely exchange secret keys even if an opponent is monitoring that communication channel. The D–H key exchange protocol, however, does not by itself address authentication (i.e. the problem of being sure of the actual identity of the person or &#x27;entity&#x27; at the other end of the communication channel). Authentication is crucial when an opponent can both monitor &quot;and alter&quot; messages within the communication channel (AKA man-in-the-middle or MITM attacks) and was addressed in the fourth section of the paper.

===Public key infrastructure===
Public key infrastructures (PKIs) have been proposed as a workaround for the problem of identity authentication. In their most usual implementation, each user applies to a “certificate authority” (CA), trusted by all parties, for a digital certificate which serves for other users as a non-tamperable authentication of identity. The infrastructure is safe, unless the CA itself is compromised. In case it is, though, many PKIs provide a way to revoke certificates so other users will not trust them. Revoked certificates are usually put in certificate revocation lists which any certificate can be matched against.

Several countries and other jurisdictions have passed legislation or issued regulations encouraging PKIs by giving (more or less) legal effect to these digital certificates (see digital signature). Many commercial firms, as well as a few government departments, have established such certificate authorities.

This does nothing to solve the problem though, as the trustworthiness of the CA itself is still not guaranteed for any particular individual. It is a form of argument from authority fallacy. For actual trustworthiness, personal verification that the certificate belongs to the CA and establishment of trust in the CA are required. This is usually not possible.

There are known cases where authoritarian governments proposed establishing so-called “national CAs” whose certificates would be mandatory to install on citizens’ devices and, once installed and trusted, could be used for monitoring, intercepting, modifying, or blocking the encrypted internet traffic.

For those new to such things, these arrangements are best thought of as electronic notary endorsements that “this public key belongs to this user”. As with notary endorsements, there can be mistakes or misunderstandings in such vouchings. Additionally, the notary itself can be untrusted. There have been several high-profile public failures by assorted certificate authorities. 

===Web of trust===
At the other end of the conceptual range is the web of trust system, which avoids central Certificate Authorities entirely. Each user is responsible for getting a certificate from another user before using that certificate to communicate with the user. PGP and GPG (an implementation of the OpenPGP Internet Standard) employ just such a web of trust mechanism.

===Password-authenticated key agreement===
Password-authenticated key agreement algorithms can perform a cryptographic key exchange utilizing knowledge of a user&#x27;s password.

=== Quantum key exchange ===
Quantum key distribution exploits certain properties of quantum physics to ensure its security. It relies on the fact that observations (or measurements) of a quantum state introduces perturbations in that state. Over many systems, these perturbations are detectable as noise by the receiver, making it possible to detect man-in-the-middle attacks. Beside the correctness and completeness of quantum mechanics, the protocol assumes the availability of an authenticated channel between Alice and Bob.

<doc id="578099" wikidata="Q407318" url="?curid=578099" title="Hypochlorous acid">
<text>Hypochlorous acid is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula , also written as HClO, HOCl, or ClHO. Its structure is . It is an acid that forms when chlorine dissolves in water, and itself partially dissociates, forming a hypochlorite anion, . HClO and are oxidizers, and the primary disinfection agents of chlorine solutions. HClO cannot be isolated from these solutions due to rapid equilibration with its precursor, chlorine.

Because of its strong antimicrobial properties, the related compounds sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and calcium hypochlorite () are ingredients in many commercial bleaches, deodorants, and disinfectants. The white blood cells of mammals, such as humans, also contain hypochlorous acid as a tool against foreign bodies. In living organisms, HOCl is generated by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with chloride ions under the catalysis of the heme enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO).

Like many other disinfectants, hypochlorous acid solutions will destroy pathogens, such as COVID-19, absorbed on surfaces. In low concentrations, such solutions can serve to disinfect open wounds. 

== History ==

Hypochlorous acid was discovered in 1834 by the French chemist Antoine Jérôme Balard (1802–1876) by adding, to a flask of chlorine gas, a dilute suspension of mercury(II) oxide in water. He also named the acid and its compounds.

Despite being relatively easy to make, it is difficult to maintain a stable hypochlorous acid solution. It is not until recent years that scientists have been able to cost-effectively produce and maintain hypochlorous acid water for stable commercial use.

==Uses==
* In organic synthesis, HClO converts alkenes to chlorohydrins.
* In biology, hypochlorous acid is generated in activated neutrophils by myeloperoxidase-mediated peroxidation of chloride ions, and contributes to the destruction of bacteria.
*In medicine, hypochlorous acid water has been used as a disinfectant and sanitiser. 
*In wound care, and as of early 2016 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved products whose main active ingredient is hypochlorous acid for use in treating wounds and various infections in humans and pets. It is also FDA-approved as a preservative for saline solutions.
*In disinfection, it has been used in the form of liquid spray, wet wipes and aerosolised application. Recent studies have shown hypochlorous acid water to be suitable for fog and aerosolised application for disinfection chambers and suitable for disinfecting indoor settings such as offices, hospitals and healthcare clinics.
* In food service and water distribution, specialized equipment to generate weak solutions of HClO from water and salt is sometimes used to generate adequate quantities of safe (unstable) disinfectant to treat food preparation surfaces and water supplies. It is also commonly used in restaurants due to its non-flammable and nontoxic characteristics.
* In water treatment, hypochlorous acid is the active sanitizer in hypochlorite-based products (e.g. used in swimming pools).
* Similarly, in ships and yachts, marine sanitation devices use electricity to convert seawater into hypochlorous acid to disinfect macerated faecal waste before discharge into the sea.
*In deodorization, hypochlorous acid has been tested to remove up to 99% of foul odours including garbage, rotten meat, toilet, stool, and urine odours.

==Formation, stability and reactions==
Addition of chlorine to water gives both hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO):
:

When acids are added to aqueous salts of hypochlorous acid (such as sodium hypochlorite in commercial bleach solution), the resultant reaction is driven to the left, and chlorine gas is formed. Thus, the formation of stable hypochlorite bleaches is facilitated by dissolving chlorine gas into basic water solutions, such as sodium hydroxide.

The acid can also be prepared by dissolving dichlorine monoxide in water; under standard aqueous conditions, anhydrous hypochlorous acid is currently impossible to prepare due to the readily reversible equilibrium between it and its anhydride:

:, &quot;K&quot; = 3.55 × 10−3 dm3/mol (at 0 °C)

The presence of light or transition metal oxides of copper, nickel, or cobalt accelerates the exothermic decomposition into hydrochloric acid and oxygen:

===Fundamental reactions===
In aqueous solution, hypochlorous acid partially dissociates into the anion &quot;hypochlorite&quot; :

Salts of hypochlorous acid are called hypochlorites. One of the best-known hypochlorites is NaClO, the active ingredient in bleach.

HClO is a stronger oxidant than chlorine under standard conditions.

:, &quot;E&quot; = +1.63 V
HClO reacts with HCl to form chlorine:

HClO reacts with ammonia to form monochloramine:
HClO can also react with organic amines, forming &quot;N&quot;-chloroamines.

Hypochlorous acid exists in equilibrium with its anhydride, dichlorine monoxide.
:, &quot;K&quot; = 3.55 × 10−3 dm3/mol (at 0 °C)

===Reactivity of HClO with biomolecules===
Hypochlorous acid reacts with a wide variety of biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, fatty acid groups, cholesterol and proteins.

====Reaction with protein sulfhydryl groups====
Knox &quot;et al.&quot; first noted that HClO is a sulfhydryl inhibitor that, in sufficient quantity, could completely inactivate proteins containing sulfhydryl groups. This is because HClO oxidises sulfhydryl groups, leading to the formation of disulfide bonds that can result in crosslinking of proteins. The HClO mechanism of sulfhydryl oxidation is similar to that of monochloramine, and may only be bacteriostatic, because once the residual chlorine is dissipated, some sulfhydryl function can be restored. One sulfhydryl-containing amino acid can scavenge up to four molecules of HClO. Consistent with this, it has been proposed that sulfhydryl groups of sulfur-containing amino acids can be oxidized a total of three times by three HClO molecules, with the fourth reacting with the α-amino group. The first reaction yields sulfenic acid () then sulfinic acid () and finally . Sulfenic acids form disulfides with another protein sulfhydryl group, causing cross-linking and aggregation of proteins. Sulfinic acid and derivatives are produced only at high molar excesses of HClO, and disulfides are formed primarily at bacteriocidal levels. Disulfide bonds can also be oxidized by HClO to sulfinic acid. Because the oxidation of sulfhydryls and disulfides evolves hydrochloric acid, this process results in the depletion HClO.

====Reaction with protein amino groups====
Hypochlorous acid reacts readily with amino acids that have amino group side-chains, with the chlorine from HClO displacing a hydrogen, resulting in an organic chloramine. Chlorinated amino acids rapidly decompose, but protein chloramines are longer-lived and retain some oxidative capacity. Thomas &quot;et al.&quot; concluded from their results that most organic chloramines decayed by internal rearrangement and that fewer available NH groups promoted attack on the peptide bond, resulting in cleavage of the protein. McKenna and Davies found that 10 mM or greater HClO is necessary to fragment proteins in vivo. Consistent with these results, it was later proposed that the chloramine undergoes a molecular rearrangement, releasing HCl and ammonia to form an aldehyde. The aldehyde group can further react with another amino group to form a Schiff base, causing cross-linking and aggregation of proteins.

====Reaction with DNA and nucleotides====
Hypochlorous acid reacts slowly with DNA and RNA as well as all nucleotides in vitro. GMP is the most reactive because HClO reacts with both the heterocyclic NH group and the amino group. In similar manner, TMP with only a heterocyclic NH group that is reactive with HClO is the second-most reactive. AMP and CMP, which have only a slowly reactive amino group, are less reactive with HClO. UMP has been reported to be reactive only at a very slow rate. The heterocyclic NH groups are more reactive than amino groups, and their secondary chloramines are able to donate the chlorine. These reactions likely interfere with DNA base pairing, and, consistent with this, Prütz has reported a decrease in viscosity of DNA exposed to HClO similar to that seen with heat denaturation. The sugar moieties are nonreactive and the DNA backbone is not broken. NADH can react with chlorinated TMP and UMP as well as HClO. This reaction can regenerate UMP and TMP and results in the 5-hydroxy derivative of NADH. The reaction with TMP or UMP is slowly reversible to regenerate HClO. A second slower reaction that results in cleavage of the pyridine ring occurs when excess HClO is present. is inert to HClO.

====Reaction with lipids====
Hypochlorous acid reacts with unsaturated bonds in lipids, but not saturated bonds, and the  ion does not participate in this reaction. This reaction occurs by hydrolysis with addition of chlorine to one of the carbons and a hydroxyl to the other. The resulting compound is a chlorohydrin. The polar chlorine disrupts lipid bilayers and could increase permeability. When chlorohydrin formation occurs in lipid bilayers of red blood cells, increased permeability occurs. Disruption could occur if enough chlorohydrin is formed. The addition of preformed chlorohydrin to red blood cells can affect permeability as well. Cholesterol chlorohydrin have also been observed, but do not greatly affect permeability, and it is believed that  is responsible for this reaction. Hypochlorous acid also reacts with a subclass of glycerophospholipids called plasmalogens, yielding chlorinated fatty aldehydes which are capable of protein modification and may play a role in inflammatory processes such as platelet aggregation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.

==Mode of disinfectant action==
&quot;E. coli&quot; exposed to hypochlorous acid lose viability in less than 0.1 seconds due to inactivation of many vital systems. Hypochlorous acid has a reported of 0.0104–0.156 ppm and 2.6 ppm caused 100% growth inhibition in 5 minutes. However, the concentration required for bactericidal activity is also highly dependent on bacterial concentration.

===Inhibition of glucose oxidation===
In 1948, Knox &quot;et al.&quot; proposed the idea that inhibition of glucose oxidation is a major factor in the bacteriocidal nature of chlorine solutions. They proposed that the active agent or agents diffuse across the cytoplasmic membrane to inactivate key sulfhydryl-containing enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. This group was also the first to note that chlorine solutions (HClO) inhibit sulfhydryl enzymes. Later studies have shown that, at bacteriocidal levels, the cytosol components do not react with HClO. In agreement with this, McFeters and Camper found that aldolase, an enzyme that Knox &quot;et al.&quot; proposes would be inactivated, was unaffected by HClO in vivo. It has been further shown that loss of sulfhydryls does not correlate with inactivation. That leaves the question concerning what causes inhibition of glucose oxidation. The discovery that HClO blocks induction of β-galactosidase by added lactose led to a possible answer to this question. The uptake of radiolabeled substrates by both ATP hydrolysis and proton co-transport may be blocked by exposure to HClO preceding loss of viability. From this observation, it proposed that HClO blocks uptake of nutrients by inactivating transport proteins. The question of loss of glucose oxidation has been further explored in terms of loss of respiration. Venkobachar &quot;et al.&quot; found that succinic dehydrogenase was inhibited in vitro by HClO, which led to the investigation of the possibility that disruption of electron transport could be the cause of bacterial inactivation. Albrich &quot;et al.&quot; subsequently found that HClO destroys cytochromes and iron-sulfur clusters and observed that oxygen uptake is abolished by HClO and adenine nucleotides are lost. It was also observed that irreversible oxidation of cytochromes paralleled the loss of respiratory activity. One way of addressing the loss of oxygen uptake was by studying the effects of HClO on succinate-dependent electron transport. Rosen &quot;et al.&quot; found that levels of reductable cytochromes in HClO-treated cells were normal, and these cells were unable to reduce them. Succinate dehydrogenase was also inhibited by HClO, stopping the flow of electrons to oxygen. Later studies revealed that Ubiquinol oxidase activity ceases first, and the still-active cytochromes reduce the remaining quinone. The cytochromes then pass the electrons to oxygen, which explains why the cytochromes cannot be reoxidized, as observed by Rosen &quot;et al.&quot; However, this line of inquiry was ended when Albrich &quot;et al.&quot; found that cellular inactivation precedes loss of respiration by using a flow mixing system that allowed evaluation of viability on much smaller time scales. This group found that cells capable of respiring could not divide after exposure to HClO.

===Depletion of adenine nucleotides===
Having eliminated loss of respiration, Albrich &quot;et al.&quot; proposes that the cause of death may be due to metabolic dysfunction caused by depletion of adenine nucleotides. Barrette &quot;et al.&quot; studied the loss of adenine nucleotides by studying the energy charge of HClO-exposed cells and found that cells exposed to HClO were unable to step up their energy charge after addition of nutrients. The conclusion was that exposed cells have lost the ability to regulate their adenylate pool, based on the fact that metabolite uptake was only 45% deficient after exposure to HClO and the observation that HClO causes intracellular ATP hydrolysis. It was also confirmed that, at bacteriocidal levels of HClO, cytosolic components are unaffected. So it was proposed that modification of some membrane-bound protein results in extensive ATP hydrolysis, and this, coupled with the cells inability to remove AMP from the cytosol, depresses metabolic function. One protein involved in loss of ability to regenerate ATP has been found to be ATP synthetase. Much of this research on respiration reconfirms the observation that relevant bacteriocidal reactions take place at the cell membrane.

===Inhibition of DNA replication===
Recently it has been proposed that bacterial inactivation by HClO is the result of inhibition of DNA replication. When bacteria are exposed to HClO, there is a precipitous decline in DNA synthesis that precedes inhibition of protein synthesis, and closely parallels loss of viability. During bacterial genome replication, the origin of replication (oriC in &quot;E. coli&quot;) binds to proteins that are associated with the cell membrane, and it was observed that HClO treatment decreases the affinity of extracted membranes for oriC, and this decreased affinity also parallels loss of viability. A study by Rosen &quot;et al.&quot; compared the rate of HClO inhibition of DNA replication of plasmids with different replication origins and found that certain plasmids exhibited a delay in the inhibition of replication when compared to plasmids containing oriC. Rosen&#x27;s group proposed that inactivation of membrane proteins involved in DNA replication are the mechanism of action of HClO.

===Protein unfolding and aggregation===
HClO is known to cause post-translational modifications to proteins, the notable ones being cysteine and methionine oxidation. A recent examination of HClO&#x27;s bactericidal role revealed it to be a potent inducer of protein aggregation. Hsp33, a chaperone known to be activated by oxidative heat stress, protects bacteria from the effects of HClO by acting as a holdase, effectively preventing protein aggregation. Strains of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; lacking Hsp33 were rendered especially sensitive to HClO. Hsp33 protected many essential proteins from aggregation and inactivation due to HClO, which is a probable mediator of HClO&#x27;s bactericidal effects.

==Hypochlorites==

Hypochlorites are the salts of hypochlorous acid; commercially important hypochlorites are calcium hypochlorite and sodium hypochlorite.

===Production of hypochlorites using electrolysis===

Solutions of hypochlorites can be produced in-situ by electrolysis of an aqueous sodium chloride solution in both batch and flow processes. The composition of the resulting solution depends on the pH at the anode. In acid conditions the solution produced will have a high hypochlorous acid concentration, but will also contain dissolved gaseous chlorine, which can be corrosive, at a neutral pH the solution will be around 75% hypochlorous acid and 25% hypochlorite. Some of the chlorine gas produced will dissolve forming hypochlorite ions. Hypochlorites are also produced by the disproportionation of chlorine gas in alkaline solutions.

==Safety==
HClO is classified as non-hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency in the US. As an oxidising agent, it can be corrosive or irritant depending on its concentration and pH.

In a clinical test, hypochlorous acid water was tested for eye irritation, skin irritation, and toxicity. The test concluded that it was non-toxic and non-irritating to the eye and skin.

In a 2017 study, a saline hygiene solution preserved with pure hypochlorous acid was shown to reduce the bacterial load significantly without altering the diversity of bacterial species on the eyelids. After 20 minutes of treatment, there was more than 99% reduction of the &quot;Staphylococci&quot; bacteria.

==Commercialisation==
Commercial disinfection applications remained elusive for a long time after the discovery of hypochlorous acid because the stability of its solution in water is difficult to maintain. The active compounds quickly deteriorate back into salt water, losing the solution its disinfecting capability, which makes it difficult to transport for wide use. It is less commonly used as a disinfectant compared to bleach and alcohol due to cost, despite its stronger disinfecting capabilities.

Technological developments have reduced manufacturing costs and allow for manufacturing and bottling of hypochlorous acid water for home and commercial use. However, most hypochlorous acid water has a short shelf life. Storing away from heat and direct sunlight can help slow the deterioration. The further development of continuous flow electrochemical cells has been implemented in new products, allowing the commercialisation of domestic and industrial continuous flow devices for the in-situ generation of hypochlorous acid for disinfection purposes.

<text>The Scotland national football team represents Scotland in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Scottish Football Association. They compete in three major professional tournaments: the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Nations League, and the UEFA European Championship. Scotland, as a country of the United Kingdom, are not a member of the International Olympic Committee (as Scottish athletes compete for Great Britain), and therefore the national team does not compete in the Olympic Games. The majority of Scotland&#x27;s home matches are played at the national stadium, Hampden Park.

Scotland are the joint oldest national football team in the world, alongside England, whom they played in the world&#x27;s first international football match in 1872. Scotland has a long-standing rivalry with England, whom they played annually from 1872 until 1989. The teams have met only nine times since then, most recently in a friendly in September 2023.

Scotland have qualified for the FIFA World Cup on eight occasions, and the UEFA European Championship four times, but they have never progressed beyond the first group stage of a finals tournament. The team have achieved some noteworthy results, such as beating the 1966 FIFA World Cup winners England 3–2 at Wembley Stadium in 1967. Archie Gemmill scored what has been described as one of the greatest World Cup goals ever in a 3–2 win during the 1978 World Cup against the Netherlands, who reached the final of the tournament. In their qualifying group for UEFA Euro 2008, Scotland defeated 2006 World Cup runners-up France 1–0 in both fixtures.

Scotland supporters are collectively known as the Tartan Army. The Scottish Football Association operates a roll of honour for every player who has made more than 50 appearances for Scotland. Kenny Dalglish holds the record for Scotland appearances, having played 102 times between 1971 and 1986. Dalglish scored 30 goals for Scotland and shares the record for most goals scored with Denis Law.

==History==
===Early history===
Scotland and England are the oldest national football teams in the world. Teams representing the two sides first competed at the Oval in five matches between 1870 and 1872. The two countries contested the first official international football match, at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, Scotland, on 30 November 1872. The match ended in a goalless draw. All eleven players who represented Scotland that day played for Glasgow amateur club Queen&#x27;s Park. Over the next forty years, Scotland played matches exclusively against the other three Home Nations—England, Wales and Ireland. The British Home Championship began in 1883, making these games competitive. The encounters against England were particularly fierce and a rivalry quickly developed.

Scotland lost just two of their first 43 international matches. It was not until a 2–0 home defeat by Ireland in 1903 that Scotland lost a match to a team other than England. This run of success meant that Scotland would have regularly topped the Elo ratings, which were calculated in 1998, between 1876 and 1904. Scotland won the British Home Championship outright on 24 occasions, and shared the title 17 times with at least one other team. A noteworthy victory for Scotland before the Second World War was the 5–1 victory over England in 1928, which led to that Scotland side being known as the &quot;Wembley Wizards&quot;. Scotland played their first match outside the British Isles in 1929, beating Norway 7–3 in Bergen. Scotland continued to contest regular friendly matches against European opposition and enjoyed wins against Germany and France before losing to the Austrian &quot;Wunderteam&quot; and Italy in 1931.

Scotland, like the other Home Nations, did not enter the three FIFA World Cups held during the 1930s. This was because the four associations had been excluded from FIFA due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players. The four associations, including Scotland, returned to the FIFA fold after the Second World War. A match between a United Kingdom team and a &quot;Rest of the World&quot; team was played at Hampden Park in 1947 to celebrate this reconciliation.

===1950s: Entering the World Cup===

The readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA meant that Scotland were eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would only attend the finals if Scotland won that competition. Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1–0 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up. Scotland had qualified by right for the World Cup, but had not met the demand of the SFA to win the Championship. The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players. The SFA instead sent the team on a tour of North America.

The same qualification rules were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, and Scotland finished second in the British Home Championship. This time the SFA allowed the team to participate in the World Cup, but its &quot;preparation was atrocious&quot;. The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads. Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied by their wives. Scotland lost 1–0 against Austria in their first game in the finals, which prompted the team manager Andy Beattie to resign hours before the game against Uruguay. Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals, and they defeated Scotland 7–0.

The 1958 FIFA World Cup finals saw Scotland draw their first game against Yugoslavia 1–1, but they then lost to Paraguay and France and went out at the first stage. Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead.

===1960s: Ian McColl and Home Championship successes===
Under the management of Ian McColl, Scotland enjoyed consecutive British Home Championship successes in 1962 and 1963. Jock Stein, John Prentice and Malky MacDonald all had brief spells as manager before Bobby Brown was appointed in 1967. Brown&#x27;s first match as manager was against the newly crowned world champions England at Wembley Stadium. Despite being underdogs, Scotland won 3–2 thanks to goals from Denis Law, Bobby Lennox and Jim McCalliog. Having defeated the world champions on their own turf, the Scotland fans hailed their team as the &quot;unofficial world champions&quot;. Despite this famous win, the Scots failed to qualify for any major competitions during the 1960s.

===1970s: World Cups and Ally MacLeod===

After Tommy Docherty&#x27;s brief spell as manager, Willie Ormond was hired in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating Zaïre, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaïre by the smallest margin.

Scotland appointed Ally MacLeod as manager in 1977, with qualification for the 1978 World Cup in Argentina far from assured. The team made a strong start under MacLeod by winning the 1977 British Home Championship, largely thanks to a 2–1 victory over England at Wembley. The Scotland fans invaded the pitch after the match, ripping up the turf and breaking a crossbar. Scotland&#x27;s form continued as they secured qualification for the World Cup with victories over Czechoslovakia and Wales.

During the build-up to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled the hopes of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland lost their first game 3–1 against Peru in Córdoba, and drew the second 1–1 against newcomers Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands. These results meant Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress. Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3–2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever; Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net. The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, and Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.

===1980s: Jock Stein and Alex Ferguson===

MacLeod resigned as manager shortly after the 1978 World Cup, and Jock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed as his successor. After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship, Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process. They beat New Zealand 5–2 in their first game at the World Cup, but lost 4–1 to a Brazil team containing Sócrates, Zico, Eder and Falcão. Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union.

Scotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1–0, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper. The 1–1 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards. His assistant Alex Ferguson took over. Scotland qualified by winning 2–0 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay following defeats by Denmark and West Germany.

In July 1986, Andy Roxburgh was the surprise appointment as the new manager of Scotland. Scotland did not succeed in qualifying for Euro 1988, but their 1–0 away win over Bulgaria in the final fixture in November 1987 helped Ireland to a surprise first-place finish and qualification for the finals in West Germany.

===1990s: Four major tournament appearances===

Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France. Scotland were drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1–0 to Costa Rica. While they recovered to beat Sweden 2–1 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1–0 and were again eliminated after the first round.

By a narrow margin, Scotland qualified for the UEFA European Championship for the first time in 1992. A 1–0 defeat by Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1–1 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through. Despite playing well in matches against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the CIS, the team was knocked out at the group stage. Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The team finished fourth in their qualifying group behind Italy, Switzerland and Portugal. When it became clear that Scotland could not qualify, Andy Roxburgh resigned from his position as team manager.

New manager Craig Brown successfully guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament. The first game against the Netherlands ended 0–0, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against England at Wembley. Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick, and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2–0 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1–0 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4–0 lead in the other match briefly put Scotland in a position to qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that they advanced instead of Scotland on goals scored.

Brown again guided Scotland to qualification for a major tournament in 1998, and Scotland were drawn against Brazil in the opening game of the 1998 World Cup. John Collins equalised from the penalty spot to level the score at 1–1, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2–1 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1–1 with Norway in Bordeaux, but the final match against Morocco ended in an embarrassing 3–0 defeat.

During the qualification for the 2000 European Championship, Scotland faced England in a two-legged playoff nicknamed the &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; by the media. Scotland won the second match 1–0 with a goal by Don Hutchison, but lost the tie 2–1 on aggregate.

===2000s: First foreign manager and 2008 near miss===
Scotland failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, finishing third in their qualifying group behind Croatia and Belgium. This second successive failure to qualify prompted Craig Brown to resign from his position after the final qualifying match. The SFA appointed former Germany manager Berti Vogts as Brown&#x27;s successor. Scotland reached the qualification play-offs for Euro 2004, where they beat the Netherlands 1–0 at Hampden Park, but suffered a 6–0 defeat in the return leg. Poor results in friendly matches and a bad start to the 2006 World Cup qualification caused the team to drop to a record low of 77th in the FIFA World Rankings. Vogts announced his resignation in 2004, blaming the hostile media for his departure.

Walter Smith, a former Rangers and Everton manager, was brought in to replace Vogts. Improved results meant that Scotland rose up the FIFA rankings and won the Kirin Cup, a friendly competition in Japan. Scotland failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, finishing third in their group behind Italy and Norway. Smith left the national side in January 2007 to return to Rangers, with Scotland leading their Euro 2008 qualification group. New manager Alex McLeish guided Scotland to wins against Georgia, the Faroe Islands, Lithuania, France and Ukraine, but defeats by Georgia and Italy ended their chances of qualification for Euro 2008. These improved results, particularly the wins against France, lifted Scotland into the top 20 of the FIFA world rankings.

After the narrow failure to qualify for Euro 2008, McLeish left to join Premier League club Birmingham City. Southampton manager George Burley was hired as the new manager, but he came in for criticism from the media after the team lost their first qualifier against Macedonia. After Scotland lost their fourth match 3–0 to the Netherlands, captain Barry Ferguson and goalkeeper Allan McGregor were excluded from the starting lineup for the following match against Iceland due to a &quot;breach of discipline&quot;. Despite winning 2–1 against Iceland, Scotland suffered a 4–0 defeat by Norway in the following qualifier, which left Scotland effectively needing to win their last two games to have a realistic chance of making the qualifying play-offs. Scotland defeated Macedonia 2–0 in the first of those two games, but were eliminated by a 1–0 loss to the Netherlands in the second game. Burley was allowed to continue in his post after a review by the SFA board, but a subsequent 3–0 friendly defeat by Wales led to his dismissal.

===2010s: Failures to qualify===

The SFA appointed Craig Levein as head coach of the national team in December 2009. In UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, Scotland were grouped with Lithuania, Liechtenstein, the Czech Republic and world champions Spain. They took just four points from the first four games, leaving the team needing three wins from their remaining four games to have a realistic chance of progression. They only managed two wins and a draw and were eliminated after a 3–1 defeat by Spain in their last match. Levein left his position as head coach following a poor start to 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, having taken just two points from four games.

Gordon Strachan was appointed Scotland manager in January 2013, but defeats in his first two competitive matches meant that Scotland were the first UEFA team to be eliminated from the 2014 World Cup. Scotland finished their qualification section by winning three of their last four matches, including two victories against Croatia. 

UEFA Euro 2016 expanded from 16 teams to 24. After losing their first qualifier in Germany, Scotland recorded home wins against Georgia, the Republic of Ireland and Gibraltar. Steven Fletcher scored the first hat-trick for Scotland since 1969 in the game with Gibraltar. Later in the group, Scotland produced an &quot;insipid&quot; performance as they lost 1–0 in Georgia. A home defeat by Germany and a late equalising goal by Poland eliminated Scotland from contention. After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed a new contract with the SFA.

In qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Scotland were drawn in the same group as England, facing their rivals in a competitive fixture for the first time since 1999. On 11 November 2016, England beat Scotland 3–0 at Wembley. The return match saw Leigh Griffiths score two late free-kicks to give Scotland a 2–1 lead, but Harry Kane scored in added time to force a 2–2 draw. A draw in Slovenia in the final game of the group ended Scottish hopes of a play-off position, and Strachan subsequently left his position by mutual consent. In February 2018, Alex McLeish was appointed manager for the second time. The team won their group in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, but McLeish left in April 2019 after a poor start to UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying, including a 3–0 loss to 117th-ranked Kazakhstan.

===2020s: Steve Clarke and UEFA Euro qualifications ===
Steve Clarke was appointed Scotland manager in May 2019. The team failed to qualify automatically for UEFA Euro 2020, but consecutive victories in penalty shootouts in the playoffs against Israel and Serbia put Scotland into their first major tournament since 1998. Defeats by the Czech Republic and Croatia, either side of a goalless draw with England, meant that Scotland finished bottom of Group D.

Six consecutive wins later that year meant that Scotland finished second in Group F of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification. This progressed the team into the play-offs, where they were paired with Ukraine in a semi-final at Hampden; Scotland lost 3–1. Later that year, Scotland won their Nations League group and promotion to League A.

The Scots began their UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying campaign with five wins out of five, including a 2–0 victory over Spain at Hampden. Despite losing their sixth match, the return game against Spain, they qualified for Euro 2024 with two matches to spare after Norway lost 1–0 to Spain. This meant they qualified through a qualifying group to reach a major tournament for the first time since 1998. Scotland was drawn to face Germany, Switzerland and Hungary in Group A. They were thrashed 5–1 by the Germans in the opening match, drew 1–1 with the Swiss and lost 1–0 to Hungary to once again finish bottom of the group. It was estimated that around 200,000 Scotland fans travelled to Euro 2024.

==Stadium==
Hampden Park in Glasgow is the traditional home of the Scotland team and is described by the SFA as the National Stadium. The present stadium is one of three stadiums to have used the name. Stadiums named Hampden Park have hosted international matches since 1878. The present site was opened in 1903 and became the primary home ground of the Scotland team from 1906. The attendance record of 149,415 was set by the Scotland v England match in 1937. Safety regulations reduced the capacity to 81,000 by 1977 and the stadium was completely redeveloped during the 1990s, giving the present capacity of 52,000. Hampden is rated as a category four (elite) stadium within the UEFA stadium categories, having previously held the five-star status under the old rating system.

Some friendly matches are played at smaller venues. Pittodrie Stadium in Aberdeen and Easter Road in Edinburgh were both used as venues during 2017. Other stadiums were also used while Hampden was being redeveloped during the 1990s. Celtic Park, Ibrox Stadium, Pittodrie Stadium and Rugby Park all hosted matches during the 1998 World Cup qualifying campaign, while Tynecastle Stadium, Pittodrie, Celtic Park and Ibrox Stadium were used for Euro 2000 qualifying matches. Since the last redevelopment to Hampden was completed in 1999, Scotland have played most of their competitive matches there. The most recent exception to this rule was in 2014, when Hampden was temporarily converted into an athletics stadium for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The SFA purchased Hampden from Queen&#x27;s Park in 2020, and all of Scotland&#x27;s home games have been played there since then.

==Media coverage==
Most matches played by Scotland are presently held by the streaming service Viaplay, who have bought the rights for Scotland games between 2024 and 2028. Viaplay announced in July 2023 that it would withdraw from serving the UK market, which resulted in Scotland games during the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League being shown on ITV4 and YouTube.

The arrangements to show Scotland matches on subscription services were criticised in 2008 by the Scottish Government, who argued that all competitive internationals should be a Listed Event that can only be broadcast on free-to-air television. Live coverage is only restricted during major tournament finals, which are normally shown on BBC Scotland or STV. The SFA have argued that limiting the rights for other games, such as qualifying matches, would reduce the revenue from that source. 

The Scottish Affairs Committee of MPs in the British House of Commons published a report in 2023 calling for more co-operation between rights holders. They also pointed to the greater coverage given on free-to-air television for qualifying matches involving England and Wales. Two friendly matches in 2024 were shown on the BBC, following an agreement with Viaplay.

Sky Sports, BBC Scotland, STV, Setanta Sports, Channel 5, BT Sport and Premier Sports are among other networks that have previously shown Scotland fixtures. Sky Sports opted to show the Euro 2020 playoff against Serbia on their Pick channel, which was available on Freeview. All matches are broadcast with full commentary on BBC Radio Scotland and, when schedules allow, BBC Radio 5 Live also.

==Colours==


Scotland traditionally wears dark blue shirts with white shorts and dark blue socks, the colours of the Queen&#x27;s Park team who represented Scotland in the first international. The blue Scotland shirt was earlier used in a February 1872 rugby international, with reports stating that &quot;the scotch were easily distinguishable by their uniform of blue jerseys... the jerseys having the thistle embroidered&quot;. The thistle had previously been worn to represent Scotland in the 1871 rugby international, but on &quot;brown&quot; shirts. The shirt is embroidered with a crest based upon the lion rampant of the Royal Standard of Scotland.

Another style often used by Scotland comprises blue shirts, white shorts and red socks, whilst several kits have used navy shorts and socks. Navy is routinely used as alternative colours for the shorts and socks when Scotland faces a team who share the same colours for these items, but when the home shirt is still appropriate.

Change colours vary, but are most commonly white or yellow shirts with blue shorts. In 2016–17, Scotland wore pink shirts with black shorts and socks as the away kit; the kit was additionally used in a single home match against Slovakia due to both Slovakia kits clashing with the Scotland home kit, which featured white sleeves. Third kits have been produced on two occasions. Amber shirts, navy shorts and navy socks were used in 2005–06, as the alternative sky blue shirts were unsuitable when Scotland travelled to teams wearing any shade of blue shirt, while an all &#x27;cherry red&#x27; kit was used a single time against Georgia in the Euro 2008 qualifiers in 2007.

From 1994 to 1996, a tartan kit was used; this kit was worn in all three of Scotland&#x27;s matches at UEFA Euro 1996.

Scotland have not always played in dark blue; on a number of occasions between 1881 and 1951 they played in the primrose and pink racing colours of Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery. A former Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery was an influential figure in Scottish football, serving as honorary President of the SFA and Edinburgh team Hearts. His colours were used most frequently in the first decade of the 20th century. When Scotland defeated England 4–1 in 1900, Lord Rosebery remarked, &quot;I have never seen my colours so well sported since Ladas won the Derby&quot;. Rosebery colours were revived as a change kit for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying matches.

The current version of the crest is a roundel similar to the crest used from 1961 to 1988 enclosing a shield, with &quot;Scotland&quot; written on the top and &quot;Est 1873&quot; on the bottom. In the shield background there are 11 thistles, representing the national flower of Scotland, in addition to the lion rampant. Since 2005, the SFA have supported the use of Scottish Gaelic on the national team&#x27;s strip in recognition of the language&#x27;s status in Scotland.

==Supporters==

Scotland fans are collectively known as the Tartan Army. During the 1970s, Scotland fans were known for their hooliganism in England, particularly after they invaded the Wembley pitch and destroyed the goalposts after the England v Scotland match in 1977. Since then, the Tartan Army have won awards from UEFA for their combination of vocal support, friendly nature and charity work. The Tartan Army have been awarded a Fair Play prize by the Belgian Olympic Committee and were named as the best supporters during the 1992 European Championship. The fans were also presented with a trophy for non-violence in sport and were voted by journalists to be the best supporters for their sense of fair play and sporting spirit at the 1998 World Cup in France.
==Results and fixtures==
==Coaching staff==

The role of a team manager was first established in May 1954, as Andy Beattie took charge of six matches before and during the 1954 FIFA World Cup. Until then the team had been picked by a SFA selection committee, and after the tournament the selection committee resumed control of the team until the appointment of Matt Busby in 1958. Busby was initially unable to assume his duties due to the serious injuries he sustained in the Munich air disaster.

Twenty-four men have occupied the post since its inception, with Beattie, Jock Stein and Alex McLeish occupying it in two spells. Six of those managers held the post on a caretaker basis. Craig Brown held the position for the longest to date; a tenure of 9 years, comprising two major tournaments and a total of 71 matches. Beattie (1954), Dawson Walker (1958), Willie Ormond (1974), Ally MacLeod (1978), Jock Stein (1982), Alex Ferguson (1986), Andy Roxburgh (1990 and 1992), Brown (1996 and 1998) and Steve Clarke (2020) have all managed the team at major competitions. Ian McColl, Ormond and MacLeod all won the British Home Championship outright.

German coach Berti Vogts became the first foreign manager of the team in 2002, but his time in charge was generally seen as a failure and the FIFA World Ranking declined to an all-time low of 88 in March 2005. Walter Smith and Alex McLeish achieved better results, with the ranking improving to an all-time high of 13 in October 2007, but both were only briefly in charge before returning to club management. George Burley and Craig Levein both had worse results with the team and were eventually sacked. Results improved somewhat under Gordon Strachan, but he was unable to secure qualification for a tournament. After McLeish had a second spell as manager, Steve Clarke was appointed in May 2019. Clarke guided the team to qualification for Euro 2020, their first major competition since 1998, and Euro 2024.

&quot;Caps and goals updated as of 18 November 2024, after the match against Poland. Clubs correct as of 3 February 2025.&quot;











===Recent call-ups===
The following players have also been selected by Scotland in the past twelve months.








*INJ Player withdrew from the squad for that game due to injury

===Honoured players===
The Scottish Football Association operates a roll of honour for every player who has made more than 50 appearances for Scotland. there are 39 members of this roll, with Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie the most recent additions to the list. The qualifying mark of 50 appearances means that many notable Scotland players including Jim Baxter, Davie Cooper, Hughie Gallacher (and every other pre-Second World War player), Archie Gemmill, John Greig, Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill, Bobby Murdoch and Lawrie Reilly are not on the roll of honour.

The Scottish Football Museum operates a hall of fame which is open to players and managers involved in Scottish football. This means that membership is not restricted to people who have played for Scotland; inductees include Brian Laudrup and Henrik Larsson, as well as John McGovern who never played in Scotland or gained an international cap. Sportscotland operates the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame, which has inducted some footballers.

==Records==
Kenny Dalglish holds the record for Scotland appearances, having played 102 times between 1971 and 1986. He is the only Scotland player to have reached 100 caps. Jim Leighton is second, having played 91 times, a Scottish record for appearances by a goalkeeper. The title of Scotland&#x27;s highest goalscorer is shared by two players. Denis Law scored 30 goals between 1958 and 1974, during which time he played for Scotland on 55 occasions. Kenny Dalglish scored an equal number from 102 appearances. Hughie Gallacher as well as being the third highest scorer is also the most prolific with his 24 goals coming from only 20 games (averaging 1.2 goals per game).

The largest margin of victory achieved by a Scotland side is 11–0 against Ireland in the 1901 British Home Championship. The record defeat occurred during the 1954 FIFA World Cup, a 7–0 deficit against reigning world champions Uruguay.

Scotland&#x27;s 1937 British Home Championship match against England set a new world record for a football attendance. The Hampden Park crowd was officially recorded as 149,415, though the true figure is unknown as a large number of additional fans gained unauthorised entry. This attendance was surpassed 13 years later by the decisive match of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, but remains a European record.

==Competitive record==
===FIFA World Cup===

Scotland did not compete in the first three World Cup competitions, held in 1930, 1934 and 1938. FIFA ruled that all its member associations must provide &quot;broken-time&quot; payments to cover the expenses of players who participated in football at the 1928 Summer Olympics. In response to what they considered to be unacceptable interference, the football associations of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales held a meeting at which they agreed to resign from FIFA. The Scottish Football Association did not rejoin FIFA as a permanent member until 1946. The SFA declined to participate in 1950 although they had qualified, as Scotland were not the British champions.

Scotland have since qualified for eight finals tournaments, including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. Scotland have never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition – no country has qualified for as many World Cup finals without progressing past the first round. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out; in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed; and in 1982, when the Soviet Union went through.


===UEFA European Championship===

Scotland have qualified for four European Championships, but have failed to advance beyond the first round. Their most recent participation was at Euro 2024. 


===UEFA Nations League===
When the UEFA Nations League was inaugurated in 2018–19, Scotland were allocated to League C. With a 3–2 win against Israel in their final match, Scotland won promotion to League B of the 2020–21 competition.

Scotland won promotion to League A in their final match of the 2022–23 competition, a goalless draw against Ukraine in Kraków.

==United Kingdom team==
Scotland has always participated by itself in most of the major football tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. At the Olympic Games the International Olympic Committee charter only permit a Great Britain Olympic football team, representing the whole of the United Kingdom, to compete. Teams of amateur players represented Great Britain at the Olympics from 1900 until 1972, but the FA stopped entering a team after then because the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished. The successful bid by London for the 2012 Summer Olympics prompted the FA to explore how a team could be entered. The SFA responded by stating that it would not participate, as it feared that this would threaten the independent status of the Scotland national team. FIFA President Sepp Blatter denied this, but the SFA expressed concern that a future President could take a different view. An agreement was reached in May 2009 whereby the FA would be permitted to organise a team using only England-qualified players, but this was successfully challenged by the British Olympic Association. Only English and Welsh players were selected for the men&#x27;s squad, but two Scottish players were selected for the women&#x27;s team.

<text>The MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm is a cryptographic hash function developed by Ronald Rivest in 1990. The digest length is 128 bits. The algorithm has influenced later designs, such as the MD5, SHA-1 and RIPEMD algorithms. The initialism &quot;MD&quot; stands for &quot;Message Digest&quot;.

The security of MD4 has been severely compromised. The first full collision attack against MD4 was published in 1995, and several newer attacks have been published since then. As of 2007, an attack can generate collisions in less than two MD4 hash operations. A theoretical preimage attack also exists.

A variant of MD4 is used in the ed2k URI scheme to provide a unique identifier for a file in the popular eDonkey2000 / eMule P2P networks. MD4 was also used by the rsync protocol (prior to version 3.0.0).

MD4 is used to compute NTLM password-derived key digests on Microsoft Windows NT, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and 11.

==Security==
Weaknesses in MD4 were demonstrated by Den Boer and Bosselaers in a paper published in 1991. The first full-round MD4 collision attack was found by Hans Dobbertin in 1995, which took only seconds to carry out at that time. In August 2004, Wang et al. found a very efficient collision attack, alongside attacks on later hash function designs in the MD4/MD5/SHA-1/RIPEMD family. This result was improved later by Sasaki et al., and generating a collision is now as cheap as verifying it (a few microseconds).

In 2008, the preimage resistance of MD4 was also broken by Gaëtan Leurent, with a 2102 attack. In 2010 Guo et al published a 299.7 attack.

In 2011, RFC 6150 stated that RFC 1320 (MD4) is historic (obsolete).

==MD4 hashes==
The 128-bit (16-byte) MD4 hashes (also termed &quot;message digests&quot;) are typically represented as 32-digit hexadecimal numbers. The following demonstrates a 43-byte ASCII input and the corresponding MD4 hash:

 MD4(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;)
 = 1bee69a46ba811185c194762abaeae90

Even a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a completely different hash, e.g. changing codice_1 to codice_2:

 MD4(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;)
 = b86e130ce7028da59e672d56ad0113df

The hash of the zero-length string is:

 MD4(&quot;) = 31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0

==MD4 test vectors==
The following test vectors are defined in RFC 1320 (The MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm)

 MD4 (&quot;) = 31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0
 MD4 (&quot;a&quot;) = bde52cb31de33e46245e05fbdbd6fb24
 MD4 (&quot;abc&quot;) = a448017aaf21d8525fc10ae87aa6729d
 MD4 (&quot;message digest&quot;) = d9130a8164549fe818874806e1c7014b

<text>Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 was a scheduled flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, United States, to Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida, United States. Shortly before midnight on December 29, 1972, the Lockheed L-1011-1 TriStar crashed into the Florida Everglades. All 3 cockpit crew members, two of the 10 flight attendants, and 96 of the 163 passengers were killed. Seventy-five people survived, with 58 of them having serious injuries.

The crash occurred while the entire flight crew were preoccupied with a burnt-out landing gear indicator light. The captain bumped the yoke on the aircraft, causing it to turn off the autopilot. Due to the focus on the landing gear and the minimal changes in the cockpit, the pilots did not notice. Because of this, the aircraft gradually lost altitude and crashed. This was the first hull loss and fatal crash of a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. It was also the first severe widebody aircraft crash.

== Aircraft ==
Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 was a regularly scheduled flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, to Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida. On December 29, 1972, Flight 401 was operated using a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar (registration N310EA), which had been delivered to the airline just a few months earlier on August 18. The aircraft was fleet number 310, and the tenth TriStar delivered to the carrier.

== Flight crew ==
The flight was commanded by Captain Robert Albin &quot;Bob&quot; Loft, aged 55, a veteran pilot ranked fiftieth in seniority at Eastern Air Lines. Loft had been with the airline for thirty-two years and had accumulated a total of 29,700 flight hours throughout his flying career. He had logged 280 hours in the L-1011. His flight crew included First Officer Albert John &quot;Bert&quot; Stockstill, aged 39, who had 5,800 hours of flying experience (with 306 of them in the L-1011) and Flight Engineer Donald Louis &quot;Don&quot; Repo, aged 51, who had 15,700 hours of flying experience (with 53 of them in the L-1011). A company employee—technical officer Angelo Donadeo, aged 47, returning to Miami from an assignment in New York City—accompanied the flight crew for the journey, but was officially an off-duty, &quot;nonrevenue passenger&quot;.

== Accident ==
Flight 401 departed New York on Friday, December 29, 1972, at 21:20EST, with 163 passengers and thirteen crew members aboard. The flight was routine until 23:32, when the plane began its approach into Miami. After lowering the gear, Stockstill noticed that the landing gear indicator, a green light identifying that the nose gear is properly locked in the &quot;down&quot; position, had not illuminated. This was later discovered to be due to a burned-out light bulb. The landing gear could have been manually lowered nonetheless. The pilots cycled the landing gear, but still failed to get the confirmation light.

Loft, who was working the radio during this leg of the flight, told the tower that they would discontinue their approach to their airport and requested to enter a holding pattern. The approach controller cleared the flight to climb to , and then hold west over the Florida Everglades. The cockpit crew removed the light assembly, and Repo was dispatched to the avionics bay beneath the flight deck to check via a small porthole whether the landing gear was indeed down. Fifty seconds after reaching their assigned altitude, Loft instructed Stockstill to put the L-1011 on autopilot. 

For the next eighty seconds, the aircraft maintained level flight. Then, it dropped , and then again flew level for two more minutes, after which it began a descent so gradual it could not be perceived by the crew. In the next seventy seconds, the airplane lost only , but this was enough to trigger the altitude warning C-chord chime located under Repo&#x27;s workstation. Repo had gone below, and no indication was heard of the pilots&#x27; voices recorded on the cockpit voice recorder that they heard the chime. In another fifty seconds, the plane was at half its assigned altitude.

As Stockstill started another turn, onto 180°, he noticed the discrepancy. The following conversation was recovered from the flight voice recorder later:

:: Stockstill: We did something to the altitude.
:: Loft: What?
:: Stockstill: We&#x27;re still at 2,000 feet, right?
:: Loft: Hey—what&#x27;s happening here?

Less than ten seconds after this exchange, Flight 401 crashed. The location was west-northwest of Miami, from the end of Runway 9L. The aircraft was traveling at when it hit the ground. With the plane in mid-turn, the left wingtip hit the surface first, then the left engine and the left landing gear, making three trails through the sawgrass, each wide and more than long. When the main part of the fuselage hit the ground, it continued to move through the grass and water, breaking up as it went.

=== Crash sequence ===
The TriStar&#x27;s port outer wing structure struck the ground first, followed by the number1 engine and the port main undercarriage. The disintegration of the aircraft that followed scattered wreckage over an area long and wide in a southwesterly direction. Only small fragments of metal marked the wingtip&#x27;s first contact, followed further on by three massive swaths cut through the mud and sawgrass by the aircraft&#x27;s extended undercarriage before two of the legs were sheared off. Then came scattered parts from the number 1 (port) engine, and fragments from the port wing itself and the port tailplane. About from the wingtip&#x27;s initial contact with the ground, the massive fuselage had begun to break up, scattering components from the underfloor galley, the cargo compartments, and the cabin interior. At along the wreckage trail, the outer section of the starboard wing tore off, gouging a crater in the soft ground as it did so. From this point on, the breakup of the fuselage became more extensive, scattering metal fragments, cabin fittings, and passenger seats widely.

The three major sections of the fuselage—the most intact of which was the tail assembly—lay in the mud towards the end of the wreckage trail. The fact that the tail assembly—rear fuselage, number2 tail-mounted engine, and remains of the empennage—finally came to rest substantially further forward than other major sections, was probably the result of the number 2 engine continuing to deliver thrust during the actual breakup of the aircraft. No complete cross-section of the passenger cabin remained, and both the port wing and tailplane were demolished to fragments. Incongruously, not far from the roofless fuselage center section with the inner portion of the starboard wing still attached, lay a large, undamaged and fully inflated rubber dinghy, one of a number carried on the TriStar in the event of an emergency water landing. The breakup of the fuselage had freed it from its stowage and activated its inflation mechanism.

== Rescue and aftermath ==
Robert &quot;Bud&quot; Marquis (1929–2008), a local airboat pilot, was out frog gigging with Ray Dickinsin (1929–1988) when they witnessed the crash. The two men rushed to rescue survivors. Marquis received burns to his face, arms and legs—a result of spilled jet fuel from the crashed TriStar—but continued shuttling people in and out of the crash site that night and the next day. For his efforts, thirty-five years after the crash, he received the Humanitarian Award from the National Air Disaster Alliance/Foundation and the &quot;Alumitech – Airboat Hero Award&quot; from the American Airboat Search and Rescue Association.

In all, seventy-five people survived the crash—sixty-seven of the 163 passengers and eight of the ten flight attendants. Despite their own injuries, the surviving flight attendants were credited with helping other survivors and several quick-thinking actions, such as warning survivors of the danger of striking matches due to jet fuel in the swamp water, as flashlights were not part of the standard equipment on commercial airliners at the time, and singing Christmas carols to keep up morale and draw the attention of rescuers. Of the cockpit crew, only Repo survived the initial crash, along with Donadeo, who was in the avionics bay with Repo at the moment of impact. Stockstill was killed on impact, while Loft died in the wreckage of the flight deck before he could be transported to hospital. Repo was evacuated to hospital, but later died from his injuries. Donadeo, the lone survivor of the four flight-deck occupants, recovered from his injuries. 

Frank Borman, a former NASA astronaut and Eastern&#x27;s senior vice president of operations, was awakened at home by a telephone call reporting a probable crash. He immediately drove to Eastern&#x27;s Miami offices and decided to charter a helicopter to the crash site, as the swampy terrain made rescue difficult, and Eastern had not heard any news of progress in rescue efforts. There he was able to land in a swampy patch of grass and coordinate rescue efforts. He accompanied three survivors on the helicopter to hospital, including a flight attendant and a passenger who lost her baby in the crash.

Most of the dead were passengers in the aircraft&#x27;s midsection. The swamp absorbed much of the energy of the crash, lessening the impact on the aircraft. The muddy waters of the Everglades had covered the wounds sustained by survivors, preventing them from bleeding to death. However, it also complicated the survivors&#x27; recuperation, as organisms in the swamp caused infection, with the potential for gas gangrene. Eight passengers became infected and were treated with hyperbaric chambers. All the survivors were injured; sixty received serious injuries and seventeen suffered minor injuries that did not require hospitalization. The most common injuries were fractures of ribs, spines, pelvises and lower extremities. Fourteen survivors had various degrees of burns.

== Investigation ==
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation discovered that the autopilot had been inadvertently switched from altitude hold to control wheel steering (CWS) mode in pitch. In this mode, once the pilot releases pressure on the yoke (control column or wheel), the autopilot maintains the pitch attitude of the aircraft until the yoke is again moved. Investigators believe the autopilot switched modes when the captain accidentally leaned against the yoke while turning to speak to the flight engineer, who was sitting behind and to the right of him. The slight forward pressure on the stick would have caused the aircraft to enter a slow descent, maintained by the CWS system.

Investigation into the aircraft&#x27;s autopilot showed that the force required to switch to CWS mode was different between the A and B channels (, respectively). Thus, the switching to CWS in channel A possibly did not occur in channel B, thus depriving the first officer of any indication the mode had changed (channel A provides the captain&#x27;s instruments with data, while channel B provides the first officer&#x27;s). 

At the same time, another flight, National 607, also had the same incident. But flight 607&#x27;s gear was actually jammed. After the emergency landing, the controller of that flight, Charles Johnson, had been dealing with the aftermath of flight 607. Miami ATC had only one three dimensional radar that could showcase the height, speed, etc., and Johnson had been using that radar. He then received Eastern 401&#x27;s transmissions. The flight had not declared an emergency. So, Johnson only knew about the so called &quot;jammed nose gear.&quot;

After Loft bumped the yoke, the aircraft had descended from the selected altitude of . A C-chord sounded from the rear speaker. This altitude alert, designed to warn the pilots of an inadvertent deviation from the selected altitude, went unnoticed by the crew. Investigators believe this was due to the crew being distracted by the nose gear light, and because the flight engineer was not in his seat when it sounded, the second officer had also been distracted. Visually, since it was nighttime and the aircraft was flying over the darkened terrain of the Everglades, no ground lights or other visual signs indicated the TriStar was slowly descending. The ATC controller hadn’t warned flight 401 of their descent, likely due to having many other flights to deal with.

Loft was found during an autopsy to have an undetected brain tumor in an area that controls vision. However, the NTSB concluded that the tumor did not contribute to the accident.

== Cause ==
The final NTSB report cited the cause of the crash as pilot error, specifically: &quot;the failure of the flight crew to monitor the flight instruments during the final four minutes of flight, and to detect an unexpected descent soon enough to prevent impact with the ground. Preoccupation with a malfunction of the nose landing gear position indicating system distracted the crew&#x27;s attention from the instruments and allowed the descent to go unnoticed.&quot;

In response to this and other accidents during the 1970s, many airlines started crew resource management training for their pilots. The training is designed to make problem solving in a cockpit much more efficient, thus causing less distraction for the crew. Flashlights are now standard equipment near jumpseats, and all jumpseats are outfitted with shoulder harnesses.

== Reported ghost sightings ==
In the months and years following the crash, stories began circulating that numerous employees and passengers of Eastern had reported sightings of deceased crew members Loft and Repo sitting aboard other L-1011s (including, in particular, N318EA). These stories speculated that parts of the crashed aircraft were salvaged after the investigation and refitted into other L-1011s. The reported hauntings were said to be seen only on the planes that used the spare parts. 

Gossip regarding the sightings spread throughout the airline to the extent that Eastern&#x27;s management warned employees that they could be dismissed if caught spreading ghost stories; Borman, Eastern&#x27;s CEO, dismissed the ghost stories as &quot;garbage.&quot; While Eastern publicly denied their planes were haunted, they reportedly removed all the salvaged parts from their L-1011 fleet. Over time, the reporting of ghost sightings stopped. An original floor board from Flight 401 remains in the archives at History Miami in South Florida. Pieces of the plane&#x27;s wreckage can also be found in Ed and Lorraine Warren&#x27;s Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut.

The story of the crash and its aftermath were documented in John G. Fuller&#x27;s 1976 book &quot;The Ghost of Flight 401&quot;. Fuller recounts stories of paranormal events aboard other Eastern aircraft and the belief that these were caused by equipment salvaged from the wreckage of Flight 401. A television movie adapted from Fuller&#x27;s book, also titled &quot;The Ghost of Flight 401&quot; and emphasizing the ghost sightings, was broadcast by NBC in February 1978. Eastern considered suing Fuller for libel, based on the author&#x27;s assertions of a cover-up by Eastern executives, but Borman opted not to, feeling a lawsuit would merely provide more publicity for Fuller&#x27;s book. Loft&#x27;s widow and children did sue Fuller — for infringement of Loft&#x27;s right of publicity, for invasion of privacy and for intentional infliction of emotional distress — but the lawsuit was dismissed and the dismissal upheld by the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal.

According to Robert J. Serling&#x27;s 1980 book &quot;From the Captain to the Colonel: An Informal History of Eastern Airlines&quot;, the claim that wreckage from Flight 401 was installed and later removed from other Eastern aircraft was false, and no Eastern employees had ever claimed to have seen or believed in the alleged ghost sightings. Skeptic Brian Dunning claims that the origin for the ghost sightings may have been a joke made by an Eastern captain after an emergency landing in which he quipped that he &quot;thought [Don] Repo&#x27;s ghost was on the plane.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
The crash was documented in Rob and Sarah Elder&#x27;s 1977 book &quot;Crash&quot;. A television movie of the same name was broadcast in October 1978. Based on the book, it dramatized the crash, rescue efforts, and NTSB investigation. Eddie Albert featured as &quot;Dunn&quot;, a fictionalized version of Captain Robert Loft.

Bob Welch&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Three Hearts&quot; includes a song titled &quot;The Ghost of Flight 401.&quot;

Footage of the aftermath appears in the disaster documentary &quot;Days of Fury&quot; (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky.

The accident and the subsequent ghost story were mentioned by Dan Aykroyd during his appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on June 6, 1984.

Flight 401 is mentioned in &quot;Supernatural&quot; S1E4 &quot;Phantom Traveler&quot; (2005).

The crash was featured in the Discovery Channel Canada/National Geographic TV series &quot;Mayday&quot;, in S5E09 &quot;Fatal Distraction&quot; (2008).

It is featured in &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot; S1E3 &quot;Human Error&quot; (2010).

A similar situation appeared in the Thai movie &quot;Dark Flight&quot; (2012), directed by Kongkiat Komesiri.

&quot;The Ghosts of Flight 401&quot;, part of the Discovery+ series Shock Docs, emphasizes the supernatural legacy of the crash.

<doc id="578109" wikidata="Q1543033" url="?curid=578109" title="Weddell Island">
<text>Weddell Island () is one of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, lying off the southwest extremity of West Falkland. It is situated west-northwest of South Georgia Island, north of Livingston Island, northeast of Cape Horn, northeast of Isla de los Estados, and east of the Atlantic entrance to Magellan Strait.

With an area of Weddell is the third largest island in the archipelago after East Falkland and West Falkland, and one of the largest private islands in the world. It has only one inhabited location, Weddell Settlement, with a single digit population engaged in sheep farming and tourism services. The island offers walks to wildlife watching sites and scenery destinations including some spectacular landscapes featuring the famous Falklands stone runs. Weddell is both an Important Plant Area and a priority Key Biodiversity Area.

It is a remote place, infrequently visited by a resupply ship and occasionally by private yachts, accessible by air with a short (some ) if expensive flight from the Falklands capital, Stanley.

== Etymology ==
Until the mid-nineteenth century Weddell Island was known as Swan Island, a name of unknown derivation recorded as early as 1785 by Capt. George Dixon, a seasoned mariner who had sailed under James Cook. Amused by this particular name and the Falklands place naming in general, he wrote: &quot;Though these islands are universally known by the name of Falkland’s, yet many of them are called by different names, just, I presume, as the fancy of different cruisers have suggested; I just mention this circumstance to prevent thy surprise, on seeing such names as Swan Island, Keppel’s Island &amp;c &amp;c.&quot; That former name is not to be confused with Swan Island in the Falkland Sound, on the other side of West Falkland.

Possibly, the island might have been named after a native bird, the Black-necked swan. The name appeared, applied to Weddell and/or Staats and Tea Islands, and translated as ‘Island(s) of Swans’ (&quot;Île(s) des Cygnes&quot; or &quot;Islas de los Cisnes&quot;) on some French and Spanish maps.

The present name of the island comes from James Weddell, a British sealer and explorer who visited the Falklands in 1819–1824, overwintered once in 1820, and then a second time in May–September 1823 ashore on the island at Quaker Harbour. Weddell&#x27;s book &quot;A Voyage Towards the South Pole&quot; documented, inter alia, certain events and persons of local history, including his running across the privateer David Jewett and the former castaway Charles Barnard. He is well known for his voyages to the Antarctic, and the Weddell seal and the geographic features Weddell Point and Weddell Glacier on South Georgia, and Weddell Sea (discovered by him in February 1823), Weddell Plain, Weddell Arm, Weddell Islands (name given by Weddell himself) and Weddell Lake in Antarctica are all named in association with him.

== History ==
=== Discovery ===

The island was discovered in 1766 by the British navigator and accomplished military commander John MacBride during the first hydrographic survey of the Falklands archipelago carried out by his ship HMS &quot;Jason&quot; out of Port Egmont, the early British settlement situated on Saunders Island off the northwest coast of West Falkland. Of his new discoveries Capt. MacBride wrote unfavourably: &quot;We found a mass of islands and broken lands, beaten by storms almost perpetual&quot;. His temperature records for the area were more agreeable though. In January and February the thermometer rose to , but no higher; in August, it once fell to , but was seldom lower than . As a result of that survey Weddell Island appeared on MacBride&#x27;s chart of the Falklands, one of the most accurate for its time. Capt. James Cook, who surveyed and mapped South Georgia but did not visit the Falklands, based his 1777 chart of the islands on MacBride&#x27;s one, inheriting some of its specific characteristics. For instance, both charts fail to show the secluded bay of Port Stephens, applying its name to present Port Albemarle instead.

Judging from contemporaneous mapping, the island was unknown to the French who established the first Falklands settlement, Port St. Louis in 1764.

The first Spanish sighting of Weddell Island was made by Miguel de Bernasani and Lieut. Francisco Orduña, from Port Stephens area, in the course of their overland trip across West Falkland in April 1769 (April 1768 according to other sources). Following a survey of the island and its principal embayment Chatham Harbour carried out by Capt. Manuel Pando in the ship &quot;San Francisco de Paula&quot; in July 1770, Weddell appeared on the map made by the ship&#x27;s pilot Joseph Puig (and widely copied by other Spanish cartographers) together with Beaver and New Islands, the group denoted as &quot;Yslas de San Miguel&quot;. Puig, a Catalan, named the large bay &quot;Puerto de San Joseph&quot; after his own name saint, which name was subsequently applied to the island itself and Hispanicized to &quot;Isla San José&quot;. Such naming practices were not uncommon at the time, indeed San Miguel was Bernasani&#x27;s name saint, while Port St. Louis honoured the name saint of the French navigator Louis Antoine de Bougainville.

=== Early history ===
The early inhabitants of the island were seal hunters. While some seal skins were taken from the Falklands by Bougainville in 1764, a large scale sealing industry was only developed since the 1770s by American and British sealers who frequented Weddell and nearby islands in the process. The first to bring their sealing vessels to the Falklands were probably Capts. Gamaliel Collins, David Smith and Greenwood from New England in 1774. Due to the nature of their trade, the sealers used to spend extensive periods of time ashore, and sometimes overwintered. So did Capt. Greenwood in his vessel &quot;King George&quot; at Port Egmont in 1774, and the British sealer &quot;United States&quot; under Capt. Benjamin Hussey in 1785 in Hussey Harbour – probably the estuary States Harbour on the southeast side of States Bay (current names States Cove and Chatham Harbour respectively). On the local conditions for survival, American sealer Edmund Fanning reviewed the available sources of food and fuel to conclude in his memoirs: &quot;In fact, a person would be able to subsist at the Falkland Islands for a considerable length of time, without experiencing any great degree of suffering&quot;. As a reminder of that period, many place names in the Weddell Island area honour sealers and sealing vessels, mostly American.

The sealers favoured Weddell and nearby Beaver Island and New Island as a base for their operations in the Falklands and South Georgia on several grounds. First, the islands offered a number of excellent harbours providing shelter against sudden westerly gales. Second, the sealers preferred to keep some distance away from the Spanish settlement of Puerto Soledad (present Port Louis) situated at the opposite extremity of the archipelago, about away by sea. Spain was hostile, regarding sealer presence and activities as a challenge to its sovereignty claim of the Falklands. Nevertheless, the Spaniards refrained from using force against the sealers, and following the abandonment of Puerto Soledad in 1811, sealer presence spread throughout the Falklands. Finally, with the discovery of Livingston Island and other territories south of 60° south latitude in 1819, the location of the Falklands’ southwesternmost islands made them the ideal staging post for a final southbound sailing leg to the new hunting grounds in Antarctica, with an occasional stopover at Staten Island (present Isla de los Estados) for the provision of necessary timber unavailable on the Falklands.

The Americans came to regard the Falklands seal fisheries as their traditional industry pursued freely since before the American Revolution, and did not hesitate to deploy the US Navy in protection of that industry from an Argentine attempt to curb American seal hunting by force in 1831. That ill-conceived attempt had long-lasting implications for the future of the islands, paving the way to a reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands in 1833.

=== A Robinson Crusoe mise-en-scène ===

In a famous Robinson Crusoe-like episode of Falklands history, American sealer Capt. Charles Barnard got marooned in the area from 11 June 1813 to 25 November 1814, together with four sailors – Jacob Green (American), and Joseph Albrook, James Louder and Samuel Ansel (Britons), accompanied by the captain&#x27;s most helpful dog named Cent, and in possession of a whaleboat. The castaways built several shelters on Weddell (Swan Island to them) while hunting feral hogs and collecting drift wood for subsistence. Under the circumstances, one of them, Ansel, developed an aggressive attitude and was temporarily exiled by his companions to survive alone at Quaker Harbour from 28 December 1813 to 16 February 1814. In the vicinity of his tussac-built bivouac, the graves and headstones of two men were found a mile up the bay who, Barnard reasoned, &quot;must have been buried long since, as the letters were almost effaced from the stones&quot;. Following his encounter with James Weddell on New Island in 1821, the latter popularized Barnard&#x27;s castaway story by his book published in 1825. Certain inaccuracies in Weddell&#x27;s retelling of events and his attempt at embellishing his compatriots’ motives for taking over Barnard&#x27;s ship &quot;Nanina&quot; and claiming it as a prize of the War of 1812 (subsequently, Barnard appealed successfully against the London prize court judgement and got his ship restored to him), probably prompted the American to write his &quot;Narrative of Sufferings and Adventures&quot; book published in 1829.

Barnard would later become a prominent figure in the Antarctic seal fishery, and Barnard Point and Rotch Dome on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands are named after him and two other American pioneers of Falklands and Antarctic sealing, the brothers Francis and William Rotch. Barnard named two features in the vicinity of Weddell Island after himself – Barnard&#x27;s Island and Barnard&#x27;s Harbour, present Dyke Island and Carew Harbour respectively.

=== Falklands War ===

The island remained unoccupied by Argentine troops and virtually unaffected by military action during the 1982 Falklands War. In particular, neither land mines nor naval mines have been planted in the Weddell Island area, and indeed, anyplace west of Fox Bay, West Falkland.

On 5 June 1982, while en route from Falkland Sound to Chatham Harbour, the diesel-electric submarine HMS &quot;Onyx&quot; commanded by Lt. Cdr. Andrew Johnson – the only non nuclear powered Royal Navy sub to serve in the war – struck a pinnacle of rock off Cape Meredith at depth, which upon subsequent dry-dock examination at Portsmouth Naval Base turned out to have damaged two torpedo tubes and dangerously impacted one of the torpedoes. On the occasion, the submarine proceeded with the transportation of a six-member Special Boat Service detachment led by Lieut. David Boyd and Sgt. William Lewis to carry out reconnaissance of Weddell Island, take out any observation posts providing guidance for approaching enemy aircraft (none, it turned out), and insert a British team to send last minute warnings of the number and flight directions of inbound Argentine Air Force planes.

=== Shipwrecks and burials ===
Five vessels were reportedly lost in Weddell waters: the schooner &quot;Castalia&quot; dragged ashore in 1893, the pilot schooner &quot;Hadassah&quot; wrecked in Smylie Channel in 1896, the cutter &quot;Messenger&quot; dragged ashore in 1920, and the cutter &quot;Weddell&quot; sunk at Dyke Island whilst being towed to Weddell Island in 1939.

There is a total of sixteen recorded graves on the island, including the earliest two found by Barnard in 1813. Half of them are in the Weddell Settlement Cemetery, with the first one dated 1889. Some deaths had to do with the poor emergency medical aid available to such remote places in the past.

== Geography ==

Weddell Island is bounded by Queen Charlotte Bay on the east and Smylie Channel on the south, and is surrounded by a number of minor islands including Dyke Island to the southeast, Sea Dog Island and Horse Block (a conspicuous sea stack) to the southwest, Tea Island, Staats Island and Governor Island to the west, Beaver Island to the northwest, and Penn Island, Barclay Island and Quaker Island to the north, with New Island lying further away on the northwest.

The island is roughly inverted triangular in shape, almost entirely bisected by Chatham Harbour. Weddell extends in south–north direction and in east–west direction. Its highly indented coastline is long. Bar its northeastern lowland part, the island is mostly hilly. Pitt Heights (elevation ) are situated in the northwest and Hotham Heights () in the west, while the south-central part of the island is occupied by certain nameless oval shaped heights that extend in east–west direction and in south–north direction, and feature the island&#x27;s summit Mount Weddell rising to .

=== Climate ===
Weddell has a maritime climate in the transition region between the tundra and subpolar zones under the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. It is influenced by the island&#x27;s location north and west of the physical boundary of the Antarctic region, the Antarctic Convergence running broadly S-shaped in between the Falklands and South Georgia, and east of the southern Andes topographic barrier. The weather on Weddell Island is slightly warmer and notably more arid than that in Stanley, with an average annual temperature of about and 500 mm annual precipitation, as compared to and 600 mm in the latter. The variation between the average temperature of the warmest months (January and February) and that of the coldest months (June and July) is just -9 °C (16.2 °F). The extreme temperatures recorded on Weddell Island are and .

By way of comparison, Weddell has an annual temperature graph very similar to that of the Faroe Islands. While the former is located at the same geographic latitude in the Southern Hemisphere as that of London (not the Faroes) in the Northern and, accordingly, the Nordic archipelago lies over nearer than Weddell to the relevant geographical pole, as far as temperatures are concerned that is compensated by the climatic influences of the cold water Falklands Current and the warm water Norwegian Current respectively. However, the similarity does not extend to precipitation as the Faroes get two and a half times more rainfall than Weddell does.

=== Weddell Island Group ===

This island group in the Falklands archipelago comprises the following insular features associated with Weddell Island, i.e. lying closer to it than to neighbouring Beaver Island or New Island (which have island groups of their own), or to West Falkland:
=== Mapping ===

Because of the Falklands&#x27; extremely indented and irregular coastline, remote location and rather late and slow process of settling the originally uninhabited islands, their mapping remained rudimentary up to the late 18th century. It was not until after the early British and Spanish hydrographic and land surveys in 1766–1770 that the islands were mapped faithfully to any detail, first their northeastern and northwestern parts where Port St. Louis (later renamed Puerto Soledad) and Port Egmont settlements were located respectively, and eventually their southeastern and southwestern areas.

== Geology ==
The oldest rocks in the Falklands are gneiss and granite in the Cape Meredith complex, around 1100 million years old. These types of rocks are visible in cliffs at the south extremity of West Falkland, Cape Meredith, and correspond to the crystalline rocks that made up the interior of the Gondwana supercontinent. They also have a great geological similarity to rocks currently found in South Africa and in Queen Maud Land in Antarctica. On top of the gneiss and granite lie layers of quartzite, sandstone, and shales or mudstone in West Falkland and adjacent areas including Weddell Island. Cross-bedding and ripple marks identify the zone where these rocks were deposited as the shallow waters of a delta environment where currents transported submarine sediments. In the case of the Falklands these paleocurrent directions mostly run northward, and are very similar to those in formations in South Africa that run southward. Comparison of the two provides evidence that the block of sandstone sediments that contains the islands has rotated. Rocks in the central part of West Falkland contain fossils of marine organisms that lived in shallow water.

=== Stone runs ===
The modern Falklands landscape owes some of its most remarkable aspects to the polar climate of the last ice age. The islands have largely remained free of glaciers, with the exception of a few small ones on the highest hills. Nevertheless, they were repeatedly deep-frozen and battered by icy winds. The erosion of particular rock varieties caused by myriad freezing-thawing cycles taking place in periglacial conditions during the last Ice Age produced the dramatic stone runs, one of the most enigmatic features of the local landscape originally noted by Bougainville&#x27;s naturalist Antoine-Joseph Pernety in 1764:
The young Darwin, who visited and explored the Falklands twice, in March 1833 and March–April 1834, wrote:
The Falkland Islands and Vitosha Mountain in Europe feature probably the most exceptional stone runs in terms of diversity, size and abundance. The highly specific combination of particular climatic conditions and rock varieties that existed there during the Quaternary explains both the formation of stone runs in certain areas of those two territories, and their absence in areas with otherwise comparable nature conditions. On the Falklands, stone runs form on outcrops of the Port Stanley and the Port Stephens Formations, and occur on East Falkland, West Falkland, and Weddell, Saunders and Keppel Islands. They appear in several varieties as stone patches, streams, terraces, fans, stripes and rivers, and are most widespread and voluminous in the Wickham Heights area of East Falkland, where the largest of them extend over . One particularly long stone river on Weddell Island extends , trending in a west-southwesterly direction from the plateau next west of Mount Weddell.

== Flora and fauna ==
Like many islands of the Falklands archipelago, Weddell is popular for its wildlife, including penguins, sealions, dolphins and a variety of other mammals and birds including endemic ones. The hogs hunted by Capt. Barnard were an early introduced alien species, recorded on Weddell Island already in the late eighteenth century. Exotic wildlife, including skunks, rheas, parrots and guanacos were introduced in the early 1930s by the then owner of the island John Hamilton (and brought in from Chile on board his ship &quot;Penelope&quot;), along with Patagonian foxes. The last, not to be confused with the extinct Falkland Island wolf, the &quot;warrah&quot;, can still be found and their eradication is being considered. One such fox eradication attempt failed in 1997–1998. Other species considered for possible eradication from Weddell include the house mice and the feral cats, most likely introduced to the Falklands by early sealing expeditions. More challenging, due to the island&#x27;s size, would be an effort to eradicate the Norwegian rat; there are some successful large scale precedents though, notably those of Campbell Island and South Georgia. Several reindeer are present but not established as they are single sex. These were brought from South Georgia shortly before their eradication from that Antarctic island carried out in 2013–2015 due to environmental considerations.

A large number of alien plants including invasive ones are widespread within Weddell Island. Most conspicuous among these are a patch of Monterey cypress trees in Weddell Settlement and a number of lengthy hedges of European gorse in the vicinity of the settlement and Kelp Creek House. Both were planted on the treeless and shrubless island primarily for the purposes of wind protection. The tree plots at Weddell, Hill Cove, Roy Cove and Carcass Island are the very few sizable ones on the Falklands. Gorse has been spreading on the island with over fifteen thriving tufts located away from its original hedge lines, and needs control. Besides gorse, the introduced species currently posing the highest threats in the Falklands are Calafate (&quot;Berberis microphylla&quot;), Creeping thistle (&quot;Cirsium arvense&quot;) and Spear thistle (&quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;). In the rivers and streams of the archipelago, introduced European brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) is displacing the local Zebra trout (&quot;Aplochiton zebra&quot;).

Scientific research has identified Weddell as both an Important Plant Area and a priority Key Biodiversity Area that merits protection. A survey of less than half of the island&#x27;s territory carried out between 2007 and 2010 has recorded a total of 114 native species (65% of the Falkland native flora) and 41 introduced ones. The island holds a number of rare and very rare plant species, twelve endemic plant species with four of them endangered, including Moore&#x27;s plantain and the largest recorded population of Falkland Rock-cress. It also hosts a globally significant population of Southern giant petrel. Germplasm collection from Weddell Island sites was carried out by the Alaska Plant Materials Center in 1998 for the purposes, among others, of possible tussac grass restoration projects in the Falklands.

== Government and politics ==

Within the Falkland Islands, Weddell is part of the Camp electoral constituency, which comprises the entire country outside of Stanley, and returns three of the eight elected members of the Falklands Legislative Assembly — currently John Birmingham (politician), Jack Ford and Teslyn Barkman. For statistical and planning purposes, Weddell is part of the Outlying Islands statistical region including the Falklands except the two primary islands, East and West Falkland, with a total surface area of and population of 43 in 2016.

=== Ownership ===
During the last one and a half centuries Weddell Island has been owned in turn by the Williams, Hamilton, Ferguson, Visick and Clifton families. One of the past owners, Robert Ferguson, was born on the island.

With its surface area of Weddell is one of the largest private islands in the world. That title is sometimes claimed by two Hawaiian islands, Niihau and Lanai, although the former is smaller at . While the latter is bigger at , technically it might not qualify as about 2% of its territory belong to independent owners.

== Economy ==
In the course of the 19th century, sealing declined due to depletion of stocks and gave way to sheep farming as the mainstay of Falklands economy, a role shared with fishing, tourism and offshore hydrocarbon exploration. Sheep were farmed commercially for wool on the islands from the 1860s. Sheep raising on Weddell Island was established in 1871 by the Williams family who bought the island, and the island&#x27;s farm at Weddell Settlement has been permanently populated since then.

The small population of the island lives in Weddell Settlement on the east coast, the remainder of the island being run as a sheep farm and wildlands. Sheep numbers have varied greatly under different island owners, between 200 and 23,000, and currently stay at 600 to 700 with an improved breeding and grazing management. Sheep raising is now confined to the Mark Point Paddocks just north of the settlement. Tourist walks from Weddell Settlement include scenery destinations like Mount Weddell and Mark Point, and wildlife watching sites like Loop Head or Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Cove in Chatham Harbour. All these activities take place northeast of the line linking New Year Cove on the southeast to Kelp Creek House on the northwest. The remaining two thirds of Weddell are sparsely visited, making it the wildest of the larger Falkland Islands.

Along with a diverse and abundant local wildlife, the island&#x27;s tourist attractions include also some spectacular landscapes featuring the famous Falklands stone runs that excited Charles Darwin&#x27;s interest and became the subject of much debate on their origins.

Trekking the stone runs might be as hard and risky as any sport, even though the stone run boulders are fixed quite stably, providing for better safety. Otherwise, the local terrain is walker and driver friendly – mostly hilly and well drained, lacking the boggy areas encountered elsewhere in the archipelago.

The tourist and farming infrastructure at Weddell Settlement is currently being renovated; in particular, the Weddell Lodge is being extended to provide additional tourist and workers accommodation during the summer period. More tourist accommodation is available in nearby Mountain View Cottage and Sea View Cottage. Several dilapidated ‘houses’ and ‘shanties’ in remote locations outside the settlement – Kelp Creek House, Chatham House, Loop Head Shanty, Stop Cove Shanty, Quaker Shanty and Sand Point Shanty – remain from times when the entire island was stocked with sheep.

Wind turbines and solar panels, supplemented by diesel generators, supply electric energy to four houses in Weddell Settlement.

=== Communications ===
The island has an airfield situated north of Weddell Settlement, with two intersecting grass runways – and long respectively – used by the Falkland Islands Government Air Service (FIGAS) Islander aircraft operating out of Stanley Airport. Air distances from Weddell Airfield: Stanley Airport , RAF Mount Pleasant , Rodolfo Marsh Aerodrome , Punta Arenas Airport and Rio Gallegos Airport .

Sea transportation is serviced by a 50-meter wooden pier in Weddell Settlement, at the head of Gull Harbour, with a ramp being presently set up. The island receives scheduled visits from the Falklands resupply vessel MV &quot;Concordia Bay&quot; every 40 days on average. For a number of years before, this service has been provided by MV &quot;Tamar&quot; under Capt. Stephen Clifton, one of the present owners of the island.

Probably the most remarkable Weddell Island ship was the wooden two-masted cutter &quot;Feuerland&quot; (the German for &quot;Tierra del Fuego&quot;), originally sailed from Europe to Punta Arenas by the German naval aviator and WWI war hero Gunther Plüschow, and used as an expedition ship supporting his pioneering aerial survey of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. The ship was sold in 1929 to John Hamilton, brought to the island and renamed &quot;Penelope&quot; after his daughter, remaining based at Weddell until the 1950s and again in 1989–1993. The ship sailed for many decades and for various shipowners between the islands of the Falklands (including a brief confiscation and use by the Argentine Navy during the Falklands War), until 2006 when she was transported back to her native Germany and listed as a historic cultural monument.

Overland travel is accomplished by foot, horse, and mechanized off-road capable transport. There are two unpaved earth roads on the island, both leaving Weddell Settlement. One of them, long, runs towards the airfield and further north to Loop Head Shanty and the headland ending up in Loop Head and Swan Point. The other one leads in westerly direction, skirting the head of Chatham Harbour and turning north at Kelp Creek House to reach Chatham House at the west corner of the bay.

<doc id="578120" wikidata="Q2880760" url="?curid=578120" title="Heteroflexibility">
<text>Heteroflexibility is a form of a sexual orientation or situational sexual behavior characterized by minimal homosexual activity in an otherwise primarily heterosexual orientation, which may or may not distinguish it from bisexuality. It has been characterized as &quot;mostly straight&quot;. Although sometimes equated with bi-curiosity to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality, other authors distinguish heteroflexibility as lacking the &quot;wish to experiment with ... sexuality&quot; implied by the bi-curious label. The corresponding situation in which homosexual activity predominates has also been described, termed homoflexibility.

== Prevalence ==
National surveys in the U.S. and Canada as of 2012 show that three to four percent of male teenagers, when given the choice to select a term that best describes their sexual feelings, desires, and behaviors, opt for &quot;mostly&quot; or &quot;predominantly&quot; heterosexual. With &quot;100% heterosexual&quot; being the largest assumed identity, &quot;mostly-heterosexual&quot; was the first runner up in self-identification. Of the 160 men interviewed for a study in 2008 and 2009, nearly one in eight reported same-sex attractions, fantasies, and crushes. The majority had these feelings since high school; a few others developed them more recently. And in a national sample of young men whose average age was 22, the &quot;mostly straight&quot; proportion increased when they completed the same survey six years later. An even higher percentage of post-high-school young-adult men in the U.S. and in a handful of other countries (including New Zealand and Norway) make the same choice.

An analytical review article looking at the experiences and meanings of same-sex sexual encounters among men and women who identify as heterosexual found that a large portion of same-sex encounters occur among those who identify as heterosexual. The prevalence of same-sex sexuality among heterosexually identifying men and women is not universal. 13.6% of women and 4.6% of men reported attraction to members of the same sex, while 12.6% of women and 2.8% of men have at some point had a same-sex sexual encounter. Findings from the National Survey of Family Growth data from 2011 to 2015 revealed another insight into how much same-sex attraction and behavior can be accounted for by heterosexually identifying people. They found that 61.9% of women and 59% of men with currently reported same-sex attractions identified as heterosexual. Similarly, 65.2% of women and 43.4% of men who have engaged in same-sex sexual encounters identify as heterosexual.

==Research and views==
, most studies of heteroflexibility have focused on young men and women, especially white women in the college environment. Research suggesting the influence of prenatal androgen exposure on female sexual identity places heteroflexibility on a continuum with bisexuality and lesbianism. Other studies have focused on social origins for the behavior, such as the shifting media presentation of bisexuality or the &quot;socialization of the male interloper fantasy&quot; in which a man is invited into a lesbian relationship as a third partner.

Unlike &quot;bisexual until graduation&quot; and similar pejoratives, heteroflexibility is typically considered to have a positive connotation, and is often a self-applied label, although the use of the term as a &quot;pop-culture slur&quot; has been attested.

Social scientists Hoy and London point out that some men who have occasional sex with other men nevertheless identify as heterosexual. They may feel that occasional sex with men is a result of female unavailability, or that their same-sex attraction is infrequent enough to not affect their identity. They may claim that while they feel romantically, physically, and emotionally attracted to women, their attraction to men is purely sexual, lacking any emotional attraction. A heteroflexible management strategy for these men is to interpret their sexual practices with women to be more important than their sexual encounters with men. They may also see themselves as masculine while associating a same-sex-attracted identity with femininity. Some of the men and women who experience same-sex encounters while identifying as heterosexual do so to avoid the negative social consequences that come with identifying as a member of the LGBT community.

There may be a difference between sexes as to why one may have same-sex sexual encounters while identifying as heterosexual. Some men who have sex with other men that identify as heterosexual may describe themselves as hypersexual and are primarily focused on having sex, with less regard for who they are having sex with. Some men may find that having sex with men is more accessible and less complicated than having sex with women. Conversely, in studies of young heterosexual women at college parties, particularly where women kiss each other, it has been seen that their reasons for this are external, such as the male attention, shock value, and alcohol.

There is some research on why people may identify as heterosexual despite having same-sex encounters. Most people in this category may reject any other label than heterosexual. This may be the same reason they avoid being labeled as bisexual. Some people recognize that they do not represent exclusive heterosexuality and will instead use other descriptors of heterosexuality. These descriptors may help explain for some that their heterosexuality is elastic and that having same-sex sexual encounters would not make one not heterosexual. Some of these people, particularly men, will use these descriptors to enforce heteronormativity. Such descriptors may enforce homophobia and misogyny. Other descriptors enforce a dichotomy of masculinity and femininity, where they are masculine. For many, the idea that someone could identify as heterosexual yet have same-sex encounters is confusing. It cannot be neatly categorized in the same way other sexualities can. Some people believe they can identify as heterosexual because there is no emotion or attraction in same-sex sexual encounters, although not everyone agrees.

== In the media ==
Most media representation of heteroflexibility is focused on heterosexual women experimenting with their sexuality. Typically, these representations are for male viewers, almost exclusively involving women. The women may clarify they are not lesbians. More often, these relationships are viewed from a view of heterosexuality. In an analysis of two magazines over 40 years, &quot;Cleo&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, there was a change in how these magazines represent lesbianism. From 1983 to 1993, the magazines had noticeably changed to a more celebratory representation of lesbianism. Between 1993 and 2003, this representation became focused on the eroticism of same-sex attraction. Between 2003 and 2013, the focus moved from eroticism to sexless and playful. These magazines have increased their representation of female same-sex attraction while increasingly viewing it from a heterosexual view, where female same-sex attraction is not about sex but little more than a sexless flirtation by heterosexuals or a performance by heterosexuals to get the attention of males.

Representation of heteroflexibility in media is often used to show that the piece is LGBT-inclusive while keeping the narrative&#x27;s focus on heterosexuality. A popular plot twist is that a heterosexual female character is willing to engage in same-sex intimacy, just for a kiss or a night. This plot twist and similar plot lines featuring heteroflexibility mainly involve women. The media franchise, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, has a heteroflexible storyline in its comic book where the main character, Buffy, has a relationship with a female soldier. After the female soldier declares her love to Buffy, they eventually have a night together. Despite this, Buffy ends the relationship almost immediately. Buffy was written in the comics to be an open-minded heterosexual woman, that intimacy with other women happens, but can never be anything more. In &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, the protagonist Rebecca&#x27;s actions are primarily motivated by an obsessive attachment to her ex-boyfriend Josh, although she occasionally hints at attraction to women, and at one point, she describes herself as a 1.8 on the Kinsey scale.

<doc id="578121" wikidata="Q931814" url="?curid=578121" title="Köprülü family">
<text>The Köprülü family (, , or &quot;Qypërli&quot;) was a noble family of Albanian origin in the Ottoman Empire. The family hailed from the town of Roshnik (near Berat) in the Sanjak of Vlora and provided six Grand Viziers of the Ottoman Empire (including Kara Mustafa Pasha, who was adopted), with several others becoming high-ranking officers. The era during which these grand viziers served is known as the Köprülü era of the Ottoman Empire.They were historically the most influential family in the Ottoman Empire after the House of Osman. 

Another notable member of the family was Köprülü Abdullah Pasha (1684–1735), who was a general in Ottoman-Persian wars of his time and acted as the governor in several provinces of the empire. Modern descendants include Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, a prominent historian of Turkish literature. Members of the family continue to live in Turkey, the Maghreb, and the United States.

In his novel The Palace of Dreams, Albanian author Ismail Kadare offers a reflection on power, politics, and family dynamics, drawing inspiration from various elements of Ottoman history, including the powerful Köprülü family. The novel explores the intertwining of personal ambition and state affairs, which resonates with the legacy of the Köprülü grand viziers who played a pivotal role in shaping the Ottoman Empire.

== Köprülü grand viziers ==
During the history of the Ottoman Empire, the Köprülü grand viziers had a reputation for dynamism in a state that would later show signs of decline and stagnation. The early viziers in particular focused on military campaigns that extended the Empire&#x27;s power. This, however, came to an end after the disastrous Battle of Vienna launched by Kara Mustafa Pasha, a member of the family (see also the Treaty of Karlowitz).

1 Kara Mustafa Pasha had been adopted by the Köprülü family and was the brother-in-law of Köprülü Fazıl Ahmet Pasha.

2 Abaza Siyavuş Pasha was a servant of Köprülü Mehmet Pasha. By marrying his daughter, Siyavuş became a son-in-law (&quot;damat&quot;) of the powerful Köprülü family.

<text>Herbert William Garratt (8 June 1864 – 25 September 1913) was an English mechanical engineer and the inventor of the Garratt system of articulated locomotives.

Garratt began his engineering career by serving an apprenticeship under John Carter Park, then locomotive superintendent of the North London Railway, from 1879 to 1882 at the North London Railway&#x27;s Bow works. He gained further experience at Doxford&#x27;s marine engineering works in Sunderland and later as an inspector for Sir Charles Fox and Sir Alexander Rendel. Garratt joined the Argentine Central Railway in 1889, where he became Locomotive Superintendent in 1892, and between 1900 and 1906 he worked for railways in Cuba, Lagos and Lima (Peru). In 1902, Garratt was elected to membership of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. He returned to England in 1906, taking on a role inspecting locomotives built for the New South Wales Government Railways by British manufacturers.

==Design and impact of Garratt locomotives==
Garratt was granted a patent for an innovative locomotive design in 1908. Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company purchased sole rights of manufacture in Britain. After the patents ran out in 1928, the company began to use the name &quot;Beyer-Garratt&quot; to distinguish the locomotives they had manufactured.

Garratt&#x27;s design for an articulated steam locomotive featured an engine unit at each end carrying coal and water supplies, and a boiler unit suspended between them on pivots. The design was deployed in many regions throughout Africa, South America, South-east Asia, Australia and New Zealand. In these regions, difficult terrain often prevailed, adding to construction costs. Usually the railway lines suffered from low load-bearing capacity because they had been built cheaply; Garratt locomotives, with their weight usually distributed over 12 to 16 driving wheels and 8 to 16 non-driving wheels, minimised destructive forces on rails. Additionally, because they were articulated, they could generally traverse sharper curves than non-articulated locomotives. Their higher ability to penetrate previously impassable regions often had the effect of increasing human and economic interactions between settlements, reducing the isolated nature of previously remote areas of the world.

Garratt locomotives were particularly effective on narrow gauge railway lines not only because of their flexibility: the size of their fireboxes below the &quot;bridge&quot; between the two engine units was constrained only by the lateral distance between the bridge frames – much greater than the distance between the narrow frames of non-articulated locomotives. This greatly increased the capacity to generate steam, on which power output depended. High efficiency compared with that of fixed-frame locomotives reduced the numbers of locomotives per train, allowed much heavier trains, and averted the need to convert rail lines to a wider gauge – an incentive for further rail network and economic expansion.

<doc id="578127" wikidata="Q713359" url="?curid=578127" title="Gilbert Vernam">
<text>Gilbert Sandford Vernam (April 3, 1890 – February 7, 1960) was a Worcester Polytechnic Institute 1914 graduate and AT&amp;T Bell Labs engineer who, in 1917, invented an additive polyalphabetic stream cipher and later co-invented an automated one-time pad cipher. Vernam proposed a teleprinter cipher in which a previously prepared key, kept on paper tape, is combined character by character with the plaintext message to produce the ciphertext. To decipher the ciphertext, the same key would be again combined character by character, producing the plaintext. 
Vernam later worked for the Postal Telegraph Company, and became an employee of Western Union when that company acquired Postal in 1943. His later work was largely with automatic switching systems for telegraph networks.

==Vernam&#x27;s patent==
The combining function Vernam specified in , issued July 22, 1919, is the XOR operation, applied to the individual impulses or bits used to encode the characters in the Baudot code. Vernam did not use the term &quot;XOR&quot; in the patent, but he implemented that operation in relay logic. In the example Vernam gave, the plaintext is &quot;A&quot;, encoded as &quot;&quot; in Baudot, and the key character is &quot;B&quot;, encoded as &quot;. The resulting ciphertext will be &quot;, which encodes a &quot;G&quot;. Combining the &quot;G&quot; with the key character &quot;B&quot; at the receiving end produces &quot;&quot;, which is the original plaintext &quot;A&quot;. The NSA has called this patent &quot;perhaps one of the most important in the history of cryptography.&quot;.

==One-time pad==
Shortly thereafter, Joseph Mauborgne, at that time a captain in the US Army Signal Corps, proposed, in addition, that the paper tape key contain random information. The two ideas, when themselves combined, implement an automatic form of the one-time pad, though neither inventor used the name then.

Claude Shannon, also at Bell Labs, proved that the one-time pad, properly implemented, is unbreakable in his World War II research that was later published in October 1949. He also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and kept secret.

==The Vernam cipher==
In modern terminology, a Vernam cipher is a symmetrical stream cipher in which the plaintext is combined with a random or pseudorandom stream of data (the &quot;keystream&quot;) to generate the ciphertext, using the Boolean &quot;exclusive or&quot; (XOR) function. This is symbolised by ⊕ and is represented by the following &quot;truth table&quot;, where + represents &quot;true&quot; and − represents &quot;false&quot;.
Other names for this function are: Not equal (NEQ), modulo 2 addition (without &#x27;carry&#x27;) and modulo 2 subtraction (without &#x27;borrow&#x27;).

The cipher is reciprocal in that the identical keystream is used both to encipher plaintext to ciphertext and to decipher ciphertext to yield the original plaintext:

::::Plaintext ⊕ Key = Ciphertext

and:

::::Ciphertext ⊕ Key = Plaintext

If the keystream is truly random and used only once, this is effectively a one-time pad. Substituting pseudorandom data generated by a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator is a common and effective construction for a stream cipher. RC4 is an example of a Vernam cipher that is widely used on the Internet.

If, however, the same keystream is used for two messages, known to cryptanalysts as a depth, the effect of the keystream can be eliminated, leaving the two plaintexts XORed together. The result is equivalent to a Running key cipher and the two plaintexts may be separated by linguistic cryptanalytical techniques.

::::Ciphertext1 ⊕ Ciphertext2 = Plaintext1 ⊕ Plaintext2

An operator&#x27;s mistake of this sort famously allowed the Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher by the British at Bletchley Park during World War II. They diagnosed how the keystream was generated, worked out how to break the cipher, and read vast quantities of high-level messages to and from German high command without ever seeing an actual Lorenz machine.

<doc id="578129" wikidata="Q2748571" url="?curid=578129" title="Dominion of New England">
<text>The Dominion of New England in America (1686–1689) was a short-lived administrative union of English colonies covering all of New England and the Mid-Atlantic Colonies, with the exception of the Delaware Colony and the Province of Pennsylvania. The region&#x27;s political structure was one of centralized control similar to the model used by the Spanish monarchy under the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The dominion was unacceptable to most colonists because they deeply resented being stripped of their rights and having their colonial charters revoked. Governor Edmund Andros tried to make legal and structural changes, but most of these were undone and the Dominion was overthrown as soon as word was received that King James II had vacated the throne in England. One notable change was the forced introduction of the Church of England into Massachusetts, whose Puritan leaders had previously refused to allow it any foothold.

The Dominion encompassed a very large area from the Delaware River in the south to Penobscot Bay in the north, composed of the Province of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay Colony, Plymouth Colony, Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut Colony, Province of New York, the provinces of East Jersey and West Jersey, and a small portion of Maine. It was too large for a single governor to manage. Governor Andros was highly unpopular and was seen as a threat by most political factions. News of the Glorious Revolution in England reached Boston in 1689, and the Puritans launched the 1689 Boston revolt against Andros, arresting him and his officers.

Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion in New York deposed the dominion&#x27;s lieutenant governor Francis Nicholson. After these events, the colonies that had been assembled into the dominion reverted to their previous forms of government, although some governed formally without a charter. King William III of England and Queen Mary II eventually issued new charters.

==Background==
A number of English colonies were established in America and in the West Indies during the first half of the 17th century, with varying attributes. Some originated as commercial ventures, such as the Virginia Colony, while others were founded for religious reasons, such as Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts Bay Colony and Rhode Island Colony. The governments of the colonies also varied. Virginia became a crown colony, despite its corporate beginning, while Massachusetts and other New England colonies had corporate charters and a great deal of administrative freedom. Other areas were proprietary colonies, such as Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Carolina, owned and under the jurisdiction of one or a few individuals.

Following the English Restoration in 1660, King Charles II sought to centralize the administration of these separate colonial entities. Charles and his government began a process that brought a number of the colonies under direct crown control. One reason for these actions was the cost of administration of individual colonies, but another significant reason was the regulation of trade. Throughout the 1660s, the English Parliament passed a number of laws to regulate the trade of the colonies, collectively called the Navigation Acts. The American colonists resisted these laws, particularly in the New England colonies which had established significant trading networks with other English colonies and with European countries and their colonies, especially Spain and the Dutch Republic. The Navigation Acts also outlawed some long-standing New England practices, in effect turning merchants into smugglers while significantly increasing the cost of doing business.

Some of the New England colonies presented specific problems for the king, and combining those colonies into a single administrative entity was seen as a way to resolve those problems. Plymouth Colony had never been formally chartered, and the New Haven Colony had sheltered two of the regicides of Charles I, the king&#x27;s father. The territory of Maine was disputed by competing grantees and by Massachusetts, and New Hampshire was a very small, recently established crown colony. The Massachusetts General Court authorized Boston silversmith John Hull to produce local coinage between 1652 and 1682, which the English government considered treasonous.

Massachusetts had a long history of virtually theocratic rule, and they exhibited little tolerance for non-Puritans, including supporters of the Church of England (which was most important for the king). Charles II repeatedly sought to change the Massachusetts government, but they resisted all substantive attempts at reform. In 1683, legal proceedings were begun to vacate the Massachusetts charter; it was formally annulled in June 1684.

England&#x27;s desire for colonies that produced agricultural staples worked well for the southern colonies, which produced tobacco, rice, and indigo, but not so well for New England due to the geology of the region. Lacking a suitable staple, the New Englanders engaged in trade and became successful competitors to English merchants. They were now starting to develop workshops that threatened to deprive England of its lucrative colonial market for manufactured articles, such as textiles, leather goods, and ironware. The plan, therefore, was to establish a uniform all-powerful government over the northern colonies so that the people would be diverted away from manufacturing and foreign trade.

==Establishment==
Following the revocation of the Massachusetts charter, Charles II and the Lords of Trade moved forward with plans to establish a unified administration over at least some of the New England colonies. The specific objectives of the dominion included the regulation of trade, reformation of land title practices to conform more to English methods and practices, coordination on matters of defense, and a streamlining of the administration into fewer centers. The Dominion initially comprised the territories of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Plymouth Colony, the Province of New Hampshire, the Province of Maine, and the Narraganset Country (Washington County, Rhode Island).
Charles II had chosen Colonel Percy Kirke to govern the dominion, but Charles died in February 1685 before the commission was approved. King James II approved Kirke&#x27;s commission later in 1685, but Kirke came under harsh criticism for his role in putting down Monmouth&#x27;s Rebellion, and his commission was withdrawn. The King issued a provisional commission on October 8, 1685 to Massachusetts Bay native Joseph Dudley as President of the Council of New England, due to delays in developing the commission for Kirke&#x27;s intended successor Sir Edmund Andros.

Dudley&#x27;s limited commission specified that he would rule with an appointed council and no representative legislature. The councilors named as members of this body included a cross-section of politically moderate men from the old colonial governments. Edward Randolph had served as the crown agent investigating affairs in New England, and he was appointed to the council, as well. Randolph was also commissioned with a long list of other posts, including secretary of the dominion, collector of customs, and deputy postmaster.

==Dudley administration==
Dudley&#x27;s charter arrived in Boston on May 14, 1686, and he formally took charge of Massachusetts on May 25. His rule did not begin auspiciously, since a number of Massachusetts magistrates refused to serve on his council. According to Edward Randolph, the Puritan magistrates &quot;were of opinion that God would never suffer me to land again in this country, and thereupon began in a most arbitrary manner to assert their power higher than at any time before.&quot; Elections of colonial military officers were also compromised when many of them refused to serve. Dudley made a number of judicial appointments, generally favoring the political moderates who had supported accommodation of the king&#x27;s wishes in the battle over the old charter.
Dudley was significantly hampered by the inability to raise revenues in the dominion. His commission did not allow the introduction of new revenue laws, and the Massachusetts government had repealed all such laws in 1683, anticipating the loss of the charter. Furthermore, many refused to pay the few remaining taxes on the grounds that they had been enacted by the old government and were thus invalid. Dudley and Randolph were largely unsuccessful at introducing the Church of England due to a lack of funding, but they were also hampered by the perceived political danger of imposing on the existing churches for their use.

Dudley and Randolph enforced the Navigation Acts, although they did not adhere entirely to the laws. Some variations were overlooked, understanding that certain provisions of the acts were unfair, and they suggested to the Lords of Trade that the laws be modified to ameliorate these conditions. However, the Massachusetts economy suffered, also negatively affected by external circumstances. A dispute eventually occurred between Dudley and Randolph over matters related to trade.

The Lords of Trade decided on September 9, 1686 to include the colonies of Rhode Island and Connecticut in the dominion, based on a petition from Dudley&#x27;s council. Andros&#x27;s commission had been issued in June, and he was given an annex to his commission to incorporate them into the dominion.

==Andros administration==
Andros had previously been governor of New York; he arrived in Boston on December 20, 1686 and immediately assumed power. He took a hard-line position, claiming that the colonists had left behind all their rights as Englishmen when they left England. The Reverend John Wise rallied his parishioners in 1687 to protest and resist taxes, so Andros had him arrested, convicted, and fined. An Andros official stated: &quot;Mr. Wise, you have no more privileges Left you then not to be Sold for Slaves.&quot;

Andros&#x27; commission called for governance by himself with a council. The initial composition of the council included representatives from each of the colonies which the dominion absorbed, but the council&#x27;s quorums were dominated by representatives from Massachusetts and Plymouth because of the inconvenience of travel and the fact that travel costs were not reimbursed.

===Church of England===
Shortly after his arrival, Andros asked each of the Puritan churches in Boston if its meetinghouse could be used for services of the Church of England, but he was consistently rebuffed. He then demanded keys to Samuel Willard&#x27;s Third Church in 1687, and services were held there under the auspices of Robert Ratcliff until 1688, when King&#x27;s Chapel was built.

===Revenue laws===
After Andros&#x27; arrival, the council began a long process of harmonizing laws throughout the dominion to conform more closely to English laws. This work was so time-consuming that Andros issued a proclamation in March 1687 stating that pre-existing laws would remain in effect until they were revised. Massachusetts had no pre-existing tax laws, so a scheme of taxation was developed that would apply to the entire dominion, developed by a committee of landowners. The first proposal derived its revenues from import duties, principally alcohol. After much debate, the committee adopted a different proposal, in essence reviving previous Massachusetts tax laws. These laws had been unpopular with farmers who felt that the taxes were too high on livestock. In order to bring in immediate revenue, Andros also received approval to increase the import duties on alcohol.

The first attempts to enforce the revenue laws were met by stiff resistance from a number of Massachusetts communities. Several towns refused to choose commissioners to assess the town population and estates, and officials from a number of them were consequently arrested and brought to Boston. Some were fined and released, while others were imprisoned until they promised to perform their duties. The leaders of Ipswich had been most vocal in their opposition to the law; they were tried and convicted of misdemeanor offenses.

The other provinces did not resist the imposition of the new law, even though the rates were higher than they had been under the previous colonial administration, at least in Rhode Island. Plymouth&#x27;s relatively poor landowners were hard hit because of the high rates on livestock.

===Town meeting laws===
One consequence of the tax protest was that Andros sought to restrict town meetings, since these were where that protest had begun. He introduced a law that limited meetings to a single annual meeting, solely for the purpose of electing officials, and explicitly banning meetings at other times for any reason. This loss of local power was widely hated. Many protests were made that the town meeting and tax laws were violations of the Magna Carta, which guaranteed taxation by representatives of the people.

===Land titles and taxes===
Andros dealt a major blow to the colonists by challenging their title to the land, as the great majority of Americans were land-owners unlike their English equals. Taylor says that they &quot;regarded secure real estate as fundamental to their liberty, status, and prosperity&quot;, and the colonists &quot;felt horrified by the sweeping and expensive challenge to their land titles.&quot; Andros had been instructed to bring colonial land title practices more in line with those in England, and to introduce quit-rents as a means of raising colonial revenues. Titles issued in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine under the colonial administration often suffered from defects of form such as lacking an imprint of the colonial seal, and most of them did not include a quit-rent payment. Land grants in colonial Connecticut and Rhode Island had been made before either colony had a charter, and there were conflicting claims in a number of areas.

The manner in which Andros approached the issue was doubly divisive, since it threatened any landowner whose title was in any way dubious. Some landowners went through the confirmation process, but many refused, since they did not want to face the possibility of losing their land, and they viewed the process as a thinly veiled land grab. The Puritans of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay refused, some of whom had extensive landholdings. All of the existing land titles in Massachusetts had been granted under the now-vacated colonial charter; in essence, Andros declared them to be void and required landowners to recertify their ownership, paying fees to the dominion and becoming subject to the charge of a quit-rent.

Andros attempted to compel the certification of ownership by issuing &quot;writs of intrusion&quot;, but large landowners who owned many parcels contested these individually, rather than recertifying all of their lands. Few new titles were issued during the Andros regime; only about 20 were approved out of 200 applications.

===Connecticut charter===
Andros&#x27; commission included Connecticut, and he asked Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter not long after his arrival in Boston. Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros&#x27; authority, unlike Rhode Island, whose officials acceded to the dominion but in fact did little to assist him. Connecticut continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter. In October 1687, Andros finally decided to travel to Connecticut to personally see to the matter. He arrived in Hartford on October 31, accompanied by an honor guard, and met that evening with the colonial leadership. The Colonists lay the charter on a table for all to see during this meeting, but the lights suddenly went out. When the lights were relit, the charter had disappeared. It was said to have been hidden in a nearby oak tree (referred to afterward as the Charter Oak) so that a search of nearby buildings could not locate the document.
Connecticut records show that its government formally surrendered its seals and ceased operation that day. Andros then traveled throughout the colony, making judicial and other appointments before returning to Boston. On December 29, 1687, the dominion council formally extended its laws over Connecticut, completing the assimilation of the New England colonies.

===Inclusion of New York and the Jerseys===
The provinces of New York, East Jersey, and West Jersey were added to the Dominion on May 7, 1688. They were remote from Boston where Andros had his seat, so New York and the Jerseys were run by Lieutenant Governor Francis Nicholson from New York City. Nicholson was an army captain and protégé of colonial secretary William Blathwayt who came to Boston in early 1687 as part of Andros&#x27; honor guard and had been promoted to his council. During the summer of 1688, Andros traveled first to New York and then to the Jerseys to establish his commission. Dominion governance of the Jerseys was complicated by the fact that the proprietors&#x27; charters had been revoked, yet they had retained their property and petitioned Andros for what were traditional manorial rights. The dominion period in the Jerseys was relatively uneventful because of their distance from the power centers and the unexpected end of the Dominion in 1689.

===Indian diplomacy===
In 1687, New France Governor Jacques-René de Brisay de Denonville, Marquis de Denonville launched an attack against Seneca villages in western New York. His objective was to disrupt trade between the English at Albany and the Iroquois confederation, to which the Seneca belonged, and to break the Covenant Chain, a peace that Andros had negotiated in 1677 while he was governor of New York. New York Governor Thomas Dongan appealed for help, and King James ordered Andros to render assistance. James also entered into negotiations with Louis XIV of France, which resulted in an easing of tensions on the northwestern frontier.

On New England&#x27;s northeastern frontier, however, the Abenaki harbored grievances against English settlers, and they began an offensive in early 1688. Andros made an expedition into Maine early in the year, in which he raided a number of Indian settlements. He also raided the trading outpost and home of Jean-Vincent d&#x27;Abbadie de Saint-Castin on Penobscot Bay. His careful preservation of the Catholic Castin&#x27;s chapel was a source of later accusations of &quot;popery&quot; against Andros.

Andros took over the administration of New York in August 1688, and he met with the Iroquois at Albany to renew the covenant. In this meeting, he annoyed the Iroquois by referring to them as &quot;children&quot; (subservient to the English) rather than &quot;brethren&quot; (equals). He returned to Boston amid further attacks on the New England frontier by Abenaki parties, who admitted that they were doing so in part because of French encouragement. The situation in Maine had also deteriorated again, with English colonists raiding Indian villages and shipping the captives to Boston. Andros castigated the Maine colonists for this and ordered the Indians to be released and returned to Maine, earning the hatred of the Maine settlers. He then returned to Maine with a significant force and began the construction of additional fortifications to protect the settlers, including Fort Andross. Andros spent the winter in Maine, and returned to Boston in March upon hearing rumors of revolution in England and discontentment in Boston.

==Glorious Revolution and dissolution==

The religious leaders of Massachusetts, led by Cotton and Increase Mather, were opposed to the rule of Andros and organized dissent targeted to influence the court in London. King James published the Declaration of Indulgence in May 1687, and Increase Mather sent a letter to thank him for the declaration, and then he suggested to his peers that they also express gratitude to the king as a means to gain favor and influence. Ten pastors agreed to do so, and they decided to send Mather to England to press their case against Andros. Edward Randolph attempted to stop him; Mather was arrested, tried, and exonerated on one charge, but Randolph made a second arrest warrant with new charges. Mather was clandestinely spirited aboard a ship bound for England in April 1688. He and other Massachusetts agents were well received by James, who promised in October 1688 that the colony&#x27;s concerns would be addressed. However, the events of the Glorious Revolution took over, and James was deposed by William III and Mary II.
The Massachusetts agents then petitioned the new monarchs and the Lords of Trade for restoration of the old Massachusetts charter. Mather furthermore convinced the Lords of Trade to delay notifying Andros of the revolution. He sent a letter to previous colonial governor Simon Bradstreet containing news that the charter had been illegally annulled and that the magistrates should &quot;prepare the minds of the people for a change.&quot; News of the revolution apparently reached some individuals as early as late March, and Bradstreet is one of several possible organizers of the revolt in Boston on April 18, 1689. He and other pre-Dominion magistrates and some members of Andros&#x27; council addressed an open letter to Andros on that day calling for his surrender. Andros, Randolph, Dudley, and other dominion supporters were arrested and imprisoned in Boston.

The dominion then effectively collapsed, as local authorities in each colony seized dominion representatives and reasserted their earlier power. In Plymouth, dominion councilor Nathaniel Clark was arrested on April 22, and previous governor Thomas Hinckley was reinstated. Rhode Island authorities resumed the colony&#x27;s charter with elections on May 1, but previous governor Walter Clarke refused to serve, and the colony continued without one. In Connecticut, the earlier government was also rapidly readopted. New Hampshire was temporarily left without formal government, and came under &quot;de facto&quot; rule by Massachusetts Governor Simon Bradstreet.

News of the Boston revolt reached New York by April 26, but Lieutenant Governor Nicholson did not take any immediate action. Andros managed to send a message to Nicholson while in captivity. Nicholson received the request for assistance in mid-May, but he was unable to take any effective action due to rising tensions in New York, combined with the fact that most of Nicholson&#x27;s troops had been sent to Maine. At the end of May, Nicholson was overthrown by local colonists supported by the militia in Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion, and he fled to England. Leisler governed New York until 1691, when King William commissioned Colonel Henry Sloughter as its governor. Sloughter had Leisler tried on charges of high treason; he was convicted in a trial presided over by Joseph Dudley and then executed.

===Massachusetts and Plymouth===
The dissolution of the dominion presented legal problems for Massachusetts and Plymouth. Plymouth never had a royal charter, and the charter of Massachusetts had been revoked. As a result, the restored governments lacked legal foundations for their existence, an issue raised by the political opponents of the leadership. This was particularly problematic in Massachusetts, whose long frontier with New France saw its defenders recalled in the aftermath of the revolt; that area was exposed to French and Indian raids after the outbreak of King William&#x27;s War in 1689. The cost of colonial defense resulted in a heavy tax burden, and the war also made it difficult to rebuild the colony&#x27;s trade.

Agents for both colonies worked in England to rectify the charter issues, with Increase Mather petitioning the Lords of Trade for a restoration of the old Massachusetts charter. King William was informed that this would result in a return of the Puritan government, and he wanted to prevent that, so the Lords of Trade decided to solve the issue by combining the two colonies. The resulting Province of Massachusetts Bay combined the territories of Massachusetts and Plymouth along with Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Elizabeth Islands that had been part of Dukes County in the Province of New York.

<text>An Ookpik () is a popular Inuit handicraft toy. It is a small, souvenir owl with large head and big eyes, a beak, and small black talons. They are often made from wolf fur, sealskin and other traditional materials.

&quot;Ukpik&quot; (ᐅᒃᐱᒃ) is the Inuktitut word for snowy owl.

==History==
The original Ookpik was created in the early 1960s and made from sealskin. The figure was recreated by Jeannie Snowball of Fort Chimo, now Kuujjuaq, for a trade fair in Philadelphia in 1964.
 The Ookpik figures were created at the Ft Chimo Eskimo Co-operative in Quebec in 1963. The Ookpik is a symbol by which Canadian handicrafts are identified internationally.

Many Canadians and Americans remember owning an Ookpik, and remember it as a popular symbol of Canada.

==Mascot==
The Northern Alberta Institute of Technology&#x27;s (NAIT) mascot is the &quot;Ook&quot;, a shortened version of &quot;Ookpik&quot;. NAIT was presented this mascot in 1964 by the Federal Department of Northern Affairs and Natural Resources (now Indian and Northern Affairs Canada). Most of NAIT&#x27;s sports teams are called the Ooks.

Okpik is both the name and the mascot for certain regional cold-weather camping programs run by the Boy Scouts of America. The original Okpik training was developed at the Northern Tier High Adventure Bases in Ely, Minnesota in the 1970s, and several other BSA high adventure bases have since adopted similar curricula.

==Music==
The Ookpik Waltz was published in 1965 by the late, Mission, British Columbia, fiddler Frankie Rodgers.

Dance of the Ookpiks, an instrumental song by the Regents, reached #10 on RPM&#x27;s Canadian Content chart on January 11, 1965 and made it onto some local charts. It did not make RPM&#x27;s main chart.

==Books==
Several books, mainly children&#x27;s, have been written about this popular owl, including:
*Kent Salisbury, illustrations by Beverly Edwards, &quot;Ookpik Visits the USA&quot;, which, when available, is valued at more than $1,500 (Little Golden Books)
* Dudley Copland, illustrations by James Simpkins &quot;OOKPIK the Ogling Arctic Owl&quot; (Canadian Century Publishers, 1965) 
* Barbara Hazen, illustrations by Irma Wilde &quot;Ookpik in the City&quot; (Big Golden Book, 1968)
* Bruce Hiscock &quot;Ookpik: The Travels of a Snowy Owl&quot; (Boyds Mills Press, 2008, )
* Dennis Lee, illustrations by Frank Newfeld, an ookpik features in the book of poems, &quot;Alligator Pie&quot; (Macmillan Publishers of Canada, )
*Douglas Coupland, the ookpik was featured in the book about Canadian culture, &quot;Souvenir of Canada&quot;, which was later made into a film (Douglas &amp; McIntyre, )
* Barbara Shook Hazen, illustrations by Harry Devlin &quot;The Adventures of Ookpik: A Golden Book&quot;, 1968
Ookpik, a comic strip by Allan Beaton, ran daily in the Toronto Telegram and approximately fifty Canadian and American newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, from November 30, 1964, until June 27, 1966. 
Another source dates the strip to 1963.

<doc id="578140" wikidata="Q643716" url="?curid=578140" title="Thorne, South Yorkshire">
<text>Thorne is a market town and civil parish in the City of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England. It was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It has a population of 16,592, increasing to 17,295 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
The land which is now Thorne was once inhabited by Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age people. It became a permanent settlement around AD 700, and is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The main industries in the town have traditionally been coal mining and farming.

==Geography==
Thorne lies east of the River Don, on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, and is located at approximately , at an elevation of around above sea level, on the Yorkshire side of the border with Lincolnshire. The civil parish of &quot;Thorne and Moorends&quot; includes the village of Moorends to the north, and the Thorne Waste (also known as Thorne Moors) section of the Thorne Moors collective of moorland to the north-east. A small part of the edge of Thorne Waste, named &quot;the Yorkshire Triangle&quot;, currently falls under North Lincolnshire, by technicality splitting this suburb of the civil parish between South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.

==Culture and community==

Thorne Memorial Park is the location for the Thorne Memorial Park Miniature Railway and the annual Thorne Festival. During the summer months, free brass band concerts are held at the park&#x27;s bandstand.

Thorne Community Wood is a community woodland created from agricultural land by Thorne-Moorends Town Council, and The Peatlands Way, a circuitous walk around the wildlife areas of Thorne and Hatfield Moors, passes to the north of the town.

Thorne&#x27;s Farmers&#x27; Market is a monthly event.

For many decades in the twentieth century Thorne Colliery was a central focus of employment within the town, although its history was very troubled.

In recent years, employment opportunities have been increasing, most notably since the opening of Nimbus Park on the outskirts of the town, where The Range have operated a major distribution centre since 2012.

==Landmarks==

Notable buildings in the town include the parish church and Peel Hill Castle. The parish church consists of material from the 12th to 15th centuries with some later additions and repairs. It is a grade I listed structure, and is dedicated to St Nicholas. Peel Hill Castle is the earthwork remains of a Norman motte built by the de Warenne family. 

Although no structure remains, the foundations indicate that it had a circular keep. It might have been used as a hunting lodge, connected with Hatfield Chase, and prisoners were kept in its tower in the 16th century. It was demolished in the 17th century. The monument is in the care of Thorne-Moorends Town Council. There are Dutch-like bridges over local canals, such as the Wykewell bridge. There is one remaining water tower, located on South End. Another water tower used to stand on Field Road, but was demolished in 2013. The subsequent empty land was, in 2015, earmarked as the planned location for a new Lidl supermarket. 
Nearby are the extensive Thorne Moors.

==Transport==

The town is served by two railway stations: Thorne North, and Thorne South; as well as Junction 6 of the M18 and junction 1 of the M180.

The town is served by four bus services, all of which are operated by First South Yorkshire. The services include the 87/87a towards Doncaster and Moorends, the 84 towards Doncaster, the 87b towards Doncaster and Moorends, and the 86 service. The latter is a local route only connecting both Thorne and Moorends with the newly built retail park. The 8/8a and 86 services only operate on weekdays and Saturdays. The 84 service operates on evenings only Monday to Saturday, and throughout the day hourly on a Sunday, this is due to there being no 87b service on a Sunday.

The A614 runs through the town, crossing the canal.

==Education==
In September 2005 a newly built school, Trinity Academy, opened in Thorne, specialising in Business and Enterprise. The £24 million state-of-the-art Academy has nine classes per year group, had an initial school population of 1250 children between the ages of 11 and 18, and is the third Christian Ethos school founded by Sir Peter Vardy. In 2004, 21% of students from Thorne and Moorends achieved five or more passes at grade C or above. Trinity was named as England&#x27;s most improved academy in 2007, for which they were presented with an award by Sir Bruce Liddington, the Schools Commissioner in England and Wales, at a conference held in London run by the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust.

The academy replaced Thorne Grammar School, whose notable alumni were the opera singer Lesley Garrett; George Porter, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist; Charles Spencer, pianist; and Sir Graham Hall, former CEO of Yorkshire Electricity.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio South Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio South Yorkshire, TX1 Radio and its own Community Radio station, TMCR 95.3.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Thorne Times&quot;.

==Sport==
Thorne&#x27;s rugby league side, Moorends-Thorne Marauders RLFC, play in the CMS Yorkshire league during the winter season and the Rugby League Conference during the summer.

The rugby union side, Thornensians RUFC currently play in Yorkshire Division 3 and have won the Yorkshire Cup on 2 occasions along with the South Yorkshire trophy on a record 12 occasions- the most recent in the 2014/15 season. Their home ground is Coulman Road and big games can attract crowds above 300.

Football is played by the Moorends Hornets and Stingers Junior Football Club.

Speedway racing, earlier known as Dirt track racing, was staged at a track on the southern edge of the town in 1930. Billed as &quot;The Wembley of the North&quot; the track followed the edge of the football pitch on the inside of the track. Rather than two sweeping bends, the track is shown on contemporary ordnance survey maps as having four corners and four straights.

The Sea Cadet unit in Thorne, TS Gambia, offers watersports and other activities to young people within the town.

<doc id="578142" wikidata="Q663928" url="?curid=578142" title="M. Scott Peck">
<text>Morgan Scott Peck (1936–2005) was an American psychiatrist and best-selling author who wrote the book &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;, published in 1978. 

==Early life==
Peck was born on May 22, 1936, in New York City, the son of Zabeth (née Saville) and David Warner Peck, an attorney and judge. His parents were Quakers. Peck was raised a Protestant (his paternal grandmother was from a Jewish family, but Peck&#x27;s father identified himself as a WASP and not as Jewish).

His parents sent him to the prestigious boarding school Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, when he was 13. In his book, &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;, he confides the story of his brief stay at Exeter, and admits that it was a most miserable time. Finally, at age 15, during the spring holiday of his third year, he came home and refused to return to the school, whereupon his parents sought psychiatric help for him and he was (much to his amusement in later life) diagnosed with depression and recommended for a month&#x27;s stay in a psychiatric hospital (unless he chose to return to school). He then transferred to Friends Seminary (a private K–12 school) in late 1952, and graduated in 1954, after which he received a BA from Harvard in 1958, and an MD degree from Case Western Reserve University in 1963.

==Career==
Peck served in administrative posts in the government during his career as a psychiatrist. He also served in the US Army and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. His army assignments included stints as chief of psychology at the Army Medical Center in Okinawa, Japan, and assistant chief of psychiatry and neurology in the office of the surgeon general in Washington, DC. He was the medical director of the New Milford Hospital Mental Health Clinic and a psychiatrist in private practice in New Milford, Connecticut. His first and best-known book, &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;, sold more than 10 million copies.

Peck&#x27;s works combined his experiences from his private psychiatric practice with a distinctly religious point of view. In his second book, &quot;People of the Lie&quot;, he wrote, &quot;After many years of vague identification with Buddhist and Islamic mysticism, I ultimately made a firm Christian commitment – signified by my non-denominational baptism on the ninth of March 1980...&quot; (Peck, 1983/1988, p11). One of his views was that people who are evil attack others rather than face their own failures.

In December 1984, Peck co-founded the Foundation for Community Encouragement (FCE), a tax-exempt, nonprofit, public educational foundation, whose stated mission is &quot;to teach the principles of community to individuals and organizations.&quot; FCE ceased day-to-day operations from 2002 to 2009. In late 2009, almost 25 years after FCE was first founded, the organization resumed functioning, and began offering community building and training events in 2010.

==Personal life==
Peck married Lily Ho in 1959, and they had three children. In 1994, they jointly received the Community of Christ International Peace Award.

While Peck&#x27;s writings emphasized the virtues of a disciplined life and delayed gratification, his personal life was far more turbulent. For example, in his book &quot;In Search of Stones&quot;, Peck acknowledged having extramarital affairs and being estranged from two of his children. In 2004, just a year before his death, Peck was divorced by Lily and married Kathleen Kline Yeates.

==Death==
Peck died at his home in Connecticut on September 25, 2005. He had had Parkinson&#x27;s disease and pancreatic and liver duct cancer. Fuller Theological Seminary houses the archives of his publications, awards, and correspondence.

==&quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;==

&quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;, published in 1978, is Peck&#x27;s best-known work, and the one that made his reputation. It is, in short, a description of the attributes that make for a fulfilled human being, based largely on his experiences as a psychiatrist and a person.

The book consists of four parts. In the first part Peck examines the notion of discipline, which he considers essential for emotional, spiritual, and psychological health, and which he describes as &quot;the means of spiritual evolution&quot;. The elements of discipline that make for such health include the ability to delay gratification, accepting responsibility for oneself and one&#x27;s actions, a dedication to truth, and &quot;balancing&quot;. &quot;Balancing&quot; refers to the problem of reconciling multiple, complex, possibly conflicting factors that impact an important decision—on one&#x27;s own behalf or on behalf of another.

In the second part, Peck addresses the nature of love, which he considers the driving force behind spiritual growth. He contrasts his own views on the nature of love against a number of common misconceptions about love, including:
* that love is identified with romantic love (he considers it a very destructive myth when it is solely relying on &quot;falling in love&quot;), 
* that love is related to dependency, 
* that true love is linked with the feeling of &quot;falling in love&quot;.
Peck argues that &quot;true&quot; love is rather an &quot;action&quot; that one undertakes &quot;consciously&quot; to extend one&#x27;s ego boundaries by including others or humanity, and is therefore the spiritual nurturing—which can be directed toward oneself, as well as toward one&#x27;s beloved.

In the third part Peck deals with religion, and the commonly accepted views and misconceptions concerning religion. He recounts experiences from several patient case histories, and the evolution of the patients&#x27; notion of God, religion, atheism—especially of their own &quot;religiosity&quot; or atheism—as their therapy with Peck progressed.

The fourth and final part concerns &quot;grace&quot;, the powerful force originating outside human consciousness that nurtures spiritual growth in human beings. To focus on the topic, he describes the miracles of health, the unconscious, and serendipity—phenomena which Peck says:
*nurture human life and spiritual growth,
*are incompletely understood by scientific thinking,
*are commonplace among humanity,
*originate outside the conscious human will.

He concludes that &quot;the miracles described indicate that our growth as human beings is being assisted by a force other than our conscious will&quot;. (Peck, 1978/1992, p281)

Random House, where the then little-known psychiatrist first tried to publish his original manuscript, turned him down, saying the final section was &quot;too Christ-y.&quot; Thereafter, Simon &amp; Schuster published the work for $7,500 and printed a modest hardback run of 5,000 copies. The book took off only after Peck hit the lecture circuit and personally sought reviews in key publications. Later reprinted in paperback in 1980, &quot;The Road&quot; first made best-seller lists in 1984 – six years after its initial publication.

==&quot;People of the Lie&quot;==

First published in 1983, &quot;People of the Lie: Toward a Psychology of Evil&quot; () followed on from Peck&#x27;s first book. Peck describes the stories of several people who came to him whom he found particularly resistant to any form of help. He came to think of them as evil and goes on to describe the characteristics of evil in psychological terms, proposing that it could become a psychiatric diagnosis. Peck points to &quot;narcissism&quot; as a type of evil in this context.

Subsequent volumes were subtitled &quot;The Hope For Healing Human Evil&quot; and &quot;Possession and Group Evil&quot;.

==Theories==

===Love===

His perspective on love (in &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;) is that love is not a &quot;feeling&quot;, it is an &quot;activity&quot; and an &quot;investment&quot;. He defines love as, &quot;The will to extend one&#x27;s self for the purpose of nurturing one&#x27;s own or another&#x27;s spiritual growth&quot; (Peck, 1978/1992, p85). Peck expands on the work of Thomas Aquinas over 700 years ago, that love is primarily actions towards nurturing the spiritual growth of another.

Peck seeks to differentiate between love and cathexis. Cathexis is what explains sexual attraction, the instinct for cuddling pets and pinching babies&#x27; cheeks. However, cathexis is not love. All the same, love cannot begin in isolation; a certain amount of cathexis is necessary to get sufficiently close to be able to love.

Once through the cathexis stage, the work of love begins. It is not a feeling. It consists of what you do for another person. As Peck says in &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;, &quot;Love is as love does.&quot; It is about giving yourself and the other person what they need to grow.

===Discipline===

&quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot; begins with the statement &quot;Life is difficult&quot;. Life was never meant to be easy and is essentially a series of problems which can either be solved or ignored. Peck wrote of the importance of discipline, describing four aspects of it:

* Delaying gratification: Sacrificing present comfort for future gains.
* Acceptance of responsibility: Accepting responsibility for one&#x27;s own decisions.
* Dedication to truth: Honesty, both in word and deed.
* Balancing: Handling conflicting requirements.

Peck argues that these are techniques of suffering, that enable the pain of problems to be worked through and systematically solved, producing growth. He argues that most people avoid the pain of dealing with their problems and suggests that it is through facing the pain of problem-solving that life becomes more meaningful.

===Neurotic and legitimate suffering===

Peck believes that it is only through suffering and agonizing using the four aspects of discipline (delaying gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing) that we can resolve the many puzzles and conflicts that we face. This is what he calls undertaking &quot;legitimate suffering&quot;. Peck argues that by trying to avoid legitimate suffering, people actually ultimately end up suffering more. This extra unnecessary suffering is what Scott Peck terms &quot;neurotic suffering&quot;. He references Carl Jung &#x27;Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering&#x27;. Peck says that our aim must be to eliminate neurotic suffering and to work through our legitimate suffering to achieve our individual goals.

===Evil===

Peck discusses evil in his three-volume book &quot;People of the Lie&quot;, as well as in a chapter of &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;. Peck characterizes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness in which there is an active rather than passive refusal to tolerate imperfection (sin) and its consequent guilt. This syndrome results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children), which is the paradoxical mechanism by which the People of the Lie commit their evil. Peck argues that these people are the most difficult of all to deal with, and extremely hard to identify. He describes in some detail several individual cases involving his patients. In one case which Peck considers as the most typical because of its subtlety, he describes Roger, a depressed teenage son of respected, well-off parents. In a series of parental decisions justified by often subtle distortions of the truth, they exhibit a consistent disregard for their son&#x27;s feelings, and a consistent willingness to destroy his growth. With false rationality and normality, they aggressively refuse to consider that they are in any way responsible for his resultant depression, eventually suggesting his condition must be incurable and genetic.

Peck makes a distinction between those who are on their way to becoming evil and those who have already crossed the line and are irretrievably evil. In the first instance, he describes George. Peck says, &quot;Basically, George, you&#x27;re a kind of a coward. Whenever the going gets a little bit rough, you sell out.&quot; Of note, this is the kind of evil that inspired the film &quot;Session 9&quot;. When asked where evil lives, Simon concludes, &quot;I live in the weak and the wounded.&quot; On the other hand, those who have crossed the line and are irretrievably evil are described as having malignant narcissism.

Some of Peck&#x27;s conclusions about the psychiatric condition that he designates as &quot;evil&quot; are derived from his close study of one patient he names Charlene. Although Charlene is not dangerous, she is ultimately unable to have empathy for others in any way. According to Peck, people like her see others as playthings or tools to be manipulated for their own uses or entertainment. Peck states that these people are rarely seen by psychiatrists, and have never been treated successfully.

Evil is described by Peck as &quot;militant ignorance&quot;. The original Judeo-Christian concept of &quot;sin&quot; is as a process that leads us to &quot;miss the mark&quot; and fall short of perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this, at least on some level, those who are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception), and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in sociopathy.

According to Peck, an evil person:
* is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding guilt and maintaining a self-image of perfection
* deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception
* projects his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets (scapegoats) while being apparently normal with everyone else (&quot;their insensitivity toward him was selective&quot; (Peck, 1983/1988, p 105))
* commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as deception of others
* abuses political (emotional) power (&quot;the imposition of one&#x27;s will upon others by overt or covert coercion&quot; (Peck, 1978/1992, p298))
* maintains a high level of respectability, and lies incessantly to do so
* is consistent in his or her sins. Evil persons are characterized not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness)
* is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim (scapegoating)
* has a covert intolerance to criticism and other forms of narcissistic injury

Most evil people realize the evil deep within themselves, but are unable to &quot;tolerate the pain of introspection&quot;, or admit to themselves that they are evil. Thus, they constantly run away from their evil by putting themselves in a position of &quot;moral superiority&quot; and putting the focus of evil on others. Evil is an extreme form of what Peck, in &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;, calls a character and personality disorder.

Using the My Lai massacre as a case study, Peck also examines group evil, discussing how human group morality is strikingly less than individual morality. Partly, he considers this to be a result of specialization, which allows people to avoid individual responsibility and pass the buck, resulting in a reduction of group conscience.

Though the topic of evil has historically been the domain of religion, Peck makes great efforts to keep much of his discussion on a scientific basis, explaining the specific psychological mechanisms by which evil operates. He was also particularly conscious of the danger of a psychology of evil being misused for personal or political ends. Peck considered that such a psychology should be used with great care, as falsely labeling people as evil is one of the very characteristics of evil. He argued that a diagnosis of evil should come from the standpoint of healing and safety for its victims, but also with the possibility even if remote, that the evil themselves may be cured.

Ultimately, Peck says that evil arises out of free choice. He describes it thus: Every person stands at a crossroads, with one path leading to God, and the other path leading to the devil. The path of God is the right path, and accepting this path is akin to submission to a higher power. However, if a person wants to convince himself and others that he has free choice, he would rather take a path which cannot be attributed to its being the right path. Thus, he chooses the path of evil.

Peck also discussed the question of the devil. Initially he believed, as with &quot;99% of psychiatrists and the majority of clergy&quot; (Peck, 1983/1988, p182), that the devil did not exist; but, after starting to believe in the reality of human evil, he then began to contemplate the reality of spiritual evil. Eventually, after having been referred several possible cases of possession and being involved in two exorcisms, he was converted to a belief in the existence of Satan. Peck considered people who are possessed as being victims of evil, but of not being evil themselves. Peck, however, considered possession to be rare, and human evil common. He did believe there was some relationship between Satan and human evil, but was unsure of its exact nature. Peck&#x27;s writings and views on possession and exorcism are to some extent influenced and based on specific accounts by Malachi Martin; however, the veracity of these accounts and Peck&#x27;s own diagnostic approach to possession have both since been questioned by a Catholic priest who is a professor of theology. It has been argued that it is not possible to find formal records to establish the veracity of Father Malachi Martin&#x27;s described cases of possession, as all exorcism files are sealed by the Archdiocese of New York, where all but one of the cases took place.

===The four stages of spiritual development===

Peck postulates that there are four stages of human spiritual development:

* Stage I is chaotic, disordered, and reckless. Very young children are in Stage I. They may defy and disobey and are unwilling to accept a &quot;will greater than their own&quot;. They are egoistical and lack empathy for others. Criminals are often people who have never grown out of Stage I.
* Stage II is the stage at which a person has blind faith in authority figures and sees the world as divided simply into good and evil, right and wrong, us and them. Once children learn to obey their parents and other authority figures (often out of fear or shame), they reach Stage II. Many religious people are Stage II. With blind faith comes humility and a willingness to obey and serve. The majority of conventionally moralistic, law-abiding citizens never move out of Stage II.
* Stage III is the stage of scientific skepticism and questioning. A Stage III person does not accept claims based on faith, but is only &quot;convinced&quot; with logic. Many people working in scientific and technological research are in Stage III. Often they reject the existence of spiritual or supernatural forces, since these are difficult to measure or prove scientifically. Those who do retain their spiritual beliefs move away from the simple, official doctrines of fundamentalism.
* Stage IV is the stage at which an individual enjoys the mystery and beauty of nature and existence. While retaining skepticism, s/he starts perceiving grand patterns in nature and develops a deeper understanding of good and evil, forgiveness and mercy, compassion and love. His/her religiousness and spirituality differ from that of a Stage II person, in the sense that s/he does not accept things through blind faith or out of fear, but from &quot;genuine&quot; belief. S/he does not judge people harshly or seek to inflict punishment on them for their transgressions. This is the stage of loving others as yourself, losing your attachment to your ego, and forgiving your enemies. Stage IV people are labeled &quot;mystics&quot;.

Peck argues that while transitions from Stage I to Stage II are sharp, transitions from Stage III to Stage IV are gradual. Nonetheless, these changes are noticeable and mark a significant difference in the personality of the individual.

===Community building===

In his book &quot;The Different Drum: Community Making and Peace&quot;, Peck says that community has three essential ingredients:

* Inclusivity
* Commitment
* Consensus

Based on his experience with community building workshops, Peck says that community building typically goes through four stages:

* Pseudocommunity: In the first stage, well-intentioned people try to demonstrate their ability to be friendly and sociable, but they do not really delve beneath the surface of each other&#x27;s ideas or emotions. They use obvious generalities and mutually established stereotypes in speech. Instead of conflict &quot;resolution&quot;, pseudocommunity involves conflict &quot;avoidance&quot;, which maintains the appearance or facade of true community. It also serves only to maintain positive emotions, instead of creating a safe space for honesty and love through bad emotions as well. While they still remain in this phase, members will never really obtain evolution or change, as individuals or as a bunch.
* Chaos: The first step towards real positivity is, paradoxically, a period of negativity. Once the mutually sustained facade of bonhomie is shed, negative emotions flood through: members start to vent their mutual frustrations, annoyances, and differences. It is a chaotic stage, but Peck describes it as a &quot;beautiful chaos&quot; because it is a sign of healthy growth (this relates closely to Dabrowski&#x27;s concept of disintegration).
* Emptiness: To transcend the stage of &quot;Chaos&quot;, members are forced to shed that which prevents real communication. Biases and prejudices, need for power and control, self-superiority, and other similar motives which are only mechanisms of self-validation and/or -protection, must yield to empathy, openness to vulnerability, attention, and trust. Hence, this stage does not mean people should be &quot;empty&quot; of thoughts, desires, ideas or opinions. Rather, it refers to emptiness of all mental and emotional &quot;distortions&quot; which &quot;reduce&quot; one&#x27;s ability to really share, listen to, and build on those thoughts, ideas, etc. It is often the hardest step in the four-level process, as it necessitates the release of patterns which people develop over time in a subconscious attempt to maintain self-worth and positive emotion. While this is therefore a stage of &quot;Fana (Sufism)&quot; in a certain sense, it should be viewed not merely as a &quot;death&quot;, but as a rebirth—of one&#x27;s true self at the individual level, and at the social level of the genuine and True community.
* True community: Having worked through emptiness, the people in the community enter a place of complete empathy with one another. There is a great level of tacit understanding. People are able to relate to each other&#x27;s feelings. Discussions, even when heated, never get sour, and motives are not questioned. A deeper and more sustainable level of happiness obtains between the members, which does not have to be forced. Even, and perhaps especially, when conflicts arise, it is understood that they are part of positive change.

Peck started the Foundation for Community Encouragement (FCE) to promote the formation of communities, which, he argues, are a first step towards uniting humanity and saving us from self-destruction.

The Blue Heron Farm is an intentional community in central North Carolina, whose founders stated that they were inspired by Peck&#x27;s writings on community. Peck himself had no involvement with this project, however.

The Exosphere Academy of Science &amp; the Arts uses community building in their teaching methodology to help students practice deeper communication, remove their &quot;masks&quot;, and feel more comfortable collaborating and building innovative projects and startups.

Based on research by Robert E. Roberts (1943–2013), Chattanooga Endeavors has used Community Building since 1996 as a group intervention to improve the learning experience of former offenders participating in work-readiness training. Roberts&#x27; research demonstrates that groups that are exposed to Community Building achieve significantly better training outcomes.

===Characteristics of true community===

Peck describes what he considers to be the most salient characteristics of a true community:
* Inclusivity, commitment, and consensus: members accept and embrace each other, celebrating their individuality and transcending their differences. They commit themselves to the effort and the people involved. They make decisions and reconcile their differences through consensus.
* Realism: members bring together multiple perspectives to better understand the whole context of the situation. Decisions are more well-rounded and humble, rather than one-sided and arrogant.
* Contemplation: members examine themselves. They are individually and collectively self-aware of the world outside themselves, the world inside themselves, and the relationship between the two.
* A safe place: members allow others to share their vulnerability, heal themselves, and express who they truly are.
* A laboratory for personal disarmament: members experientially discover the rules for peacemaking and embrace its virtues. They feel and express compassion and respect for each other as fellow human beings.
* A group that can fight gracefully: members resolve conflicts with wisdom and grace. They listen and understand, respect each other&#x27;s gifts, accept each other&#x27;s limitations, celebrate their differences, bind each other&#x27;s wounds, and commit to a struggle together rather than against each other.
* A group of all leaders: members harness the &quot;flow of leadership&quot; to make decisions and set a course of action. It is the spirit of community itself that leads, and not any single individual.
* A spirit: The true spirit of community is the spirit of peace, love, wisdom and power. Members may view the source of this spirit as an outgrowth of the collective self or as the manifestation of a Higher Will.

<text>Edward Hugh Hebern (April 23, 1869 – February 10, 1952) was an early inventor of rotor machines, devices for encryption.

==Background==

Edward Hugh Hebern was born in Streator, Illinois, on April 23, 1869. His parents were Charles and Rosanna (Rosy) Hebern. They met in Harris County, Texas while Charles was serving as guard and escort from the civil war. On February 4, 1866, they married in Harris, Texas. Rosanna was only fifteen years old. After mustering out of the service on May 29, 1866, Charles and his new wife returned to Springfield, Illinois, and on June 18, 1866, he received his final pay and discharge.

Edward had an older sister, Arizona (Zoa) born in 1867, two younger brothers, Daniel Boone Hebern, born on February 17, 1871, and William Hebern, born April 8, 1875, in Houston, Texas, as well as a younger sister, Nellie Hebern, born in 1874.

At the age of 6, on August 4, 1875, Edward Hugh and three of his siblings were admitted to the Illinois Soldiers’ and Sailors’ home in Normal, Illinois. According to the Soldiers’ home register their father was listed as having died in 1874 in an unknown location, but he was admitted to the same Soldiers’ Home 40 years later. By February 13, 1879, the youngest Hebern child, William, was admitted to the Soldiers’ Home. Six months later on August 12, 1879, Rosanna married Archibald Thompson in Bloomington, Illinois.

On June 14, 1881, two months before her 14th birthday, Zoa left the Soldiers’ Home. Edward was discharged from the Soldiers’ Home in May 1883, after turning 14, and went to Odin, Illinois where he worked on a farm. By 1885, Daniel, Nellie, and William were all in Odin, Illinois. Zoa married Edward F. Clark (27 yrs. old) on August 18, 1886, in Coffey County, Kansas. Then they headed to Utah.

The rest of the children eventually moved to Madera, Ca. beginning with the two eldest boys in 1896. Daniel Boone Hebern was in North Fork, California working as a laborer; his brother, Edward Hugh Hebern was in Madera farming. Daniel purchased two plots of land in North Fork.

==Patent==
He got a patent in 1918, shortly before three others patented (in other countries) much the same thing. They were Arthur Scherbius in Germany, Hugo Koch in the Netherlands, and Arvid Damm in Sweden. Hebern started a company to market the Hebern rotor machine; one of his employees was Agnes Meyer, who left the Navy in Washington, D.C., to work for Hebern in California. Scherbius designed the Enigma, Koch sold his patent to Scherbius a few years later, and Damm&#x27;s company — taken over by Boris Hagelin after his death — moved to Switzerland and is still in existence, as Crypto AG.

By September 1922 Hebern started construction of the Hebern Building at 829 Harrison Street in Oakland, California. The striking two-story structure was built to accommodate 1,500 workers and had a luxurious office for Hebern. The 1923 stockholders’ report said it was “one of the most beautiful structures in California and said to be the only building in the State of true Gothic architecture throughout.”
By the time it was completed the following year, it had cost somewhere between $380,000 and $400,000, and the company still had no income. In fact, its first sale, to the Italian government, was still twenty-three months away. Eventually Hebern would sell twelve of his early machines to the Navy, the Pacific Steamship Company of Seattle, and a few other buyers, but his ambitious building was repossessed. The Hebern code building still stands today at 829 Harrison Street in Oakland and is primarily used as Oakland’s Asian resource center.
Hebern&#x27;s implementation of his idea was less secure than he believed, for William F. Friedman found at least one method of attack when it was offered to the US Government. Hebern&#x27;s company did not prosper, his promotional efforts for it were questioned, and he was tried and convicted for fraud. Agnes Meyer returned to Washington to work for the Navy.

Friedman went on to design a much more secure and complex rotor machine for the US Army. It eventually became the SIGABA.

<text>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), sometimes known as acne inversa or Verneuil&#x27;s disease, is a long-term dermatological condition characterized by the occurrence of inflamed and swollen lumps. These are typically painful and break open, releasing fluid or pus. The areas most commonly affected are the underarms, under the breasts, perineum, buttocks, and the groin. Scar tissue remains after healing. HS may significantly limit many everyday activities, for instance, walking, hugging, moving, and sitting down. Sitting disability may occur in patients with lesions in sacral, gluteal, perineal, femoral, groin or genital regions; and prolonged periods of sitting down can also worsen the condition of the skin of these patients.
The exact cause is usually unclear, but believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. About a third of people with the disease have an affected family member. Other risk factors include obesity and smoking. The condition is not caused by an infection, poor hygiene, or the use of deodorant. Instead, it is believed to be caused by hair follicles being obstructed, with the nearby apocrine sweat glands being strongly implicated in this obstruction. The sweat glands themselves may or may not be inflamed. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms.
No cure is known, though surgical excision with wet-to-dry dressings, proper wound care, and warm baths or showering with a pulse-jet shower may be used in those with mild disease. Cutting open the lesions to allow them to drain does not result in significant benefit. While antibiotics are commonly used, evidence for their use is poor. Immunosuppressive medication may also be tried. In those with more severe disease, laser therapy or surgery to remove the affected skin may be viable. Rarely, a skin lesion may develop into skin cancer.
If mild cases of HS are included, then the estimate of its frequency is from 1–4% of the population. Women are three times more likely to be diagnosed with it than men. Onset is typically in young adulthood and may become less common after 50 years old. It was first described between 1833 and 1839 by French anatomist Alfred Velpeau.

== Terminology ==
Although hidradenitis suppurativa is often referred to as acne inversa, it is not a form of acne, and lacks the core defining features of acne such as the presence of closed comedones and increased sebum production.

== Causes ==
The exact cause of hidradenitis suppurativa remains unknown, and there has, in the recent past, been notable disagreement among experts in this regard. The condition, however, likely stems from both genetic and environmental causes. Specifically, an immune-mediated pathology has been proposed, although environmental factors have not been ruled out.

Lesions will occur in any body areas with hair follicles, and/or sweat glands, although areas such as the axilla, groin, and perineal region are more commonly involved. This theory includes most of these potential indicators:
* Post-pubescent individuals
* Blocked hair follicles or blocked apocrine sweat glands
* Excessive sweating
* Androgen dysfunction
* Genetic disorders that alter cell structure

The historical understanding of the disease suggests dysfunctional apocrine glands or dysfunctional hair follicles, possibly triggered by a blocked gland, which creates inflammation, pain, and a swollen lesion.

=== Triggering factors ===

Several triggering factors should be taken into consideration:
* Obesity is an exacerbating rather than a triggering factor, through mechanical irritation, occlusion, and skin maceration.
* Tight clothing, and clothing made of heavy, nonbreathable materials
* Deodorants, depilation products, shaving of the affected area – their association with HS is still an ongoing debate among researchers.
* Drugs, in particular oral contraceptive pills, cigarette smoking, and lithium.
* Hot and especially humid climates.
* Stress

=== Predisposing factors ===
* Genetic factors: an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern has been proposed.
* Endocrine factors: 
** Sex hormones, especially an excess of androgens, are thought to be involved, although the apocrine glands are not sensitive to these hormones. Women often have outbreaks before their menstrual period and after pregnancy; HS severity usually decreases during pregnancy and after menopause.
** Diabetes mellitus is common in hidradenitis suppurativa and seems to be a risk factor.

Some cases have been found to result from mutations in the &quot;NCSTN&quot;, &quot;PSEN1&quot;, or &quot;PSENEN&quot; genes. The genes produce proteins that are all components of a complex called gamma- (γ-) secretase. This complex cuts apart (cleaves) many different proteins, which is an important step in several chemical signaling pathways. One of these pathways, known as notch signaling, is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling is also involved in normal immune system function. Studies suggest that mutations in the &quot;NCSTN&quot;, &quot;PSEN1&quot;, or &quot;PSENEN&quot; gene impair notch signaling in hair follicles. Although little is known about the mechanism, abnormal notch signaling appears to promote the development of nodules and to lead to inflammation in the skin. In addition, the composition of the intestinal microflora and as a consequence dietary patterns appear to play a role. Although dysbiosis of the cutaneous microbiome apparent in HS is not observed, the concurrent existence of inflammatory gut and skin diseases has led to the postulation of a gut-skin axis in which gut microbiota is implicated. Indeed, analysis of bacterial taxa in fecal samples from HS patients support the possibility of a role for intestinal microbial alterations in this chronic inflammatory skin disease.

Precocious puberty is more common among children and adolescents with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) compared to those without the condition, according to a recent case-control study. An analysis of the Explorys database revealed that pediatric patients with precocious puberty have double the risk of developing HS, even after adjusting for factors like demographic characteristics and body mass index (BMI).

== Diagnosis ==
Early diagnosis is essential in avoiding tissue damage. However HS is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late due to healthcare professionals not being aware of the condition or people not consulting with a physician. Globally, the diagnosis is delayed more than 7 years in average after symptoms appear. This is much longer than with other skin conditions.

=== Stages ===

Hidradenitis suppurativa presents itself in three stages. Due to the large spectrum of clinical severity and the severe impact on quality of life, a reliable method for evaluating HS severity is needed.

==== Hurley&#x27;s staging system ====

Hurley&#x27;s staging system was the first classification system proposed, and is still in use for the classification of patients with skin diseases (i.e., psoriasis, HS, acne). Hurley separated patients into three groups based largely on the presence and extent of cicatrization and sinuses. It has been used as a basis for clinical trials in the past and is a useful basis to approach therapy for patients. These three stages are based on Hurley&#x27;s staging system, which is simple and relies on the subjective extent of the diseased tissue the patient has. Hurley&#x27;s three stages of hidradenitis suppurativa are:

==== Sartorius staging system ====

The Sartorius staging system is more sophisticated than Hurley&#x27;s. Sartorius &quot;et al.&quot; suggested that the Hurley system is not sophisticated enough to assess treatment effects in clinical trials during research. This classification allows for better dynamic monitoring of the disease severity in individual patients. The elements of this staging system are:
* Anatomic regions involved (axilla, groin gluteal, or other region or inframammary region left or right)
* Number and types of lesions involved (abscesses, nodules, fistulas or sinuses, scars, points for lesions of all regions involved)
* The distance between lesions, in particular the longest distance between two relevant lesions (i.e., nodules and fistulas in each region or size if only one lesion present)
* The presence of normal skin in between lesions (i.e., if all lesions are clearly separated by normal skin)

Points are accumulated in each of the above categories, and added to give both a regional and total score. In addition, the authors recommend adding a visual analog scale for pain or using the dermatology life quality index (DLQI, or the &#x27;skindex&#x27;) when assessing HS.

== Treatment ==
Treatment depends upon presentation and severity of the disease. Due to the poorly studied nature of the disease, the effectiveness of drugs and therapies were unclear. Clear and sensitive communication from health care professionals, social and psychological interventions can help managing the emotional impact of the condition and aid necessary lifestyle changes. In May 2023, the European Commission (EC) approved Cosentyx (secukinumab) for active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults.

Other possible treatments include the following:

=== Cryotherapy ===
Cryotherapy has demonstrated efficacy against the disease, with 88% of persistent lesions resolving in a clinical trial of 23 patients.

=== Lifestyle ===
Warm baths may be tried in those with mild disease. Weight loss and the cessation of smoking are also recommended.
Moreover, dietary removal of beer and brewer&#x27;s yeast has shown some results.

=== Medication ===
* Antibiotics: taken by mouth, these are used for their anti-inflammatory properties rather than to treat infection. Most effective is a combination of rifampicin and clindamycin given concurrently for 2–3 months. Popular antibiotics also include tetracycline and minocycline. Topical clindamycin has been shown to have an effect in double-blind placebo controlled studies. In a retrospective review and telephone survey, intravenous ertapenem therapy showed clinical improvement with 80.3% of subjects reporting medium to high satisfaction and 90.8% would recommend ertapenem to other patients.
* Corticosteroid injections, also known as intralesional steroids, can be particularly useful for localized disease, if the drug can be prevented from escaping via the sinuses.
* Antiandrogen therapy, hormonal therapy with antiandrogenic medications such as spironolactone, flutamide, cyproterone acetate, ethinylestradiol, finasteride, dutasteride, and metformin, have been found to be effective in clinical studies. However, the quality of available evidence is low and does not presently allow for robust evidence-based recommendations.
* Intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection of anti-inflammatory (TNF inhibitors; anti-TNF-alpha) drugs such as infliximab, and etanercept This use of these drugs is not currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and is somewhat controversial, so may not be covered by insurance.
* Biologics: Studies have supported that various biologics have a positive effect on HS lesions. Specifically adalimumab at weekly intervals is useful. Adalimumab and Secukinumab are both approved by the FDA for the treatment of HS as of 2023.
* Topical isotretinoin is usually ineffective in people with HS, and is more commonly known as a medication for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Individuals affected by HS who responded to isotretinoin treatment tended to have milder cases of the condition.
* Zinc and Nicotinamide, at doses of 90 mg and 30 mg respectively, have shown efficacy against mild to moderate hidradenitis suppurativa in a controlled retrospective clinical trial.

=== Surgery ===

When the process becomes chronic, wide surgical excision is the procedure of choice.

Wounds in the affected area do not heal by secondary intention, and immediate or delayed application of a split-thickness skin graft is an option.
Another option is covering the defect with a perforator flap. With this technique, the (mostly totally excised) defect is covered with tissue from an area nearby. For example, the axilla with a fully excised defect of 15 × 7 cm can be covered with a thoracodorsal artery perforator flap.. A less invasive excision procedure called Skin-Tissue-sparing Excision with Electrosurgical Peeling or &quot;STEEP&quot; has also been developed for treating moderate to severe disease.

=== Laser hair removal ===

The 1064-nm wavelength laser for hair removal may aid in the treatment of HS. A randomized control study has shown improvement in HS lesions with the use of a .

=== Botox injection ===
A 2022 study reported that administration of Botulinum toxin resulted in either clinical improvement or improved quality of life in 96.8% (n = 30/31) of HS patients. Level of evidence was moderate. It concluded that the treatment was a safe and potentially effective alternative for hidradenitis suppurativa patients resistant to standard of care therapies.

== Prognosis ==
In stage III disease, as classified by the Hurley&#x27;s staging system, fistulae left undiscovered, undiagnosed, or untreated, can rarely lead to the development of squamous cell carcinoma in the anus or other affected areas. Other stage III chronic sequelae may also include anemia, multilocalized infections, amyloidosis, and arthropathy. Stage III complications have been known to lead to sepsis, but clinical data are still uncertain.

=== Potential complications ===
* Contractures and reduced mobility of the lower limbs and axillae due to fibrosis and scarring occur. Severe lymphedema may develop in the lower limbs.
* Local and systemic infections (meningitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc.), are seen, which may even progress to sepsis.
* Higher risk for diabetes mellitus. Treatment of HS may contribute to remission of diabetes.
* Interstitial keratitis
* Anal, rectal, or urethral fistulae
* Normochromic or hypochromic anemia
* People with HS may be at increased risk for autoimmune disorders including ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis.
* Squamous cell carcinoma has been found on rare occasions in chronic hidradenitis suppurativa of the anogenital region. The mean time to the onset of this type of lesion is 10 years or more and the tumors are usually highly aggressive.
* Tumors of the lung and oral cavity, and liver cancer
* Hypoproteinemia and amyloidosis, which can lead to kidney failure and death
* Seronegative and usually asymmetric arthropathy: pauciarticular arthritis, polyarthritis/polyarthralgia syndrome

=== Impact on mental health ===
HS is a painful and socially isolating condition which leads to a negative impact on mental health as well. A 2020 meta-analysis found that 21% of people with HS have depression and 12% have anxiety. A 2020 study found that people with HS have suicide rates more than double the rates in controls, and also have a higher risk of attempting suicide.

== Epidemiology ==

=== Prevalence ===
Estimates of the prevalence of HS vary worldwide and there is no accepted generalization. In the US, the prevalence is estimated to be 0.1% while in Europe it is thought to be 1% or more.

==== Gender ====
In North America and Europe, women are three times more likely to have HS. However, in South Korea, men are twice as likely to have HS.

==== Age ====
HS is the most prevalent in people in their 40s and 50s.

==== Comorbidities ====
Especially endocrine diseases are more common in HS. Diabetes mellitus may be both a causal factor contributing to the evolution and/or severity of HS and a consequence of inflammation in HS. Thyroid disorders are more common, too, in HS.

== History ==
* From 1833 to 1839, in a series of three publications, Velpeau identified and described a disease now known as hidradenitis suppurativa.
* In 1854, Verneuil described hidradenitis suppurativa as &quot;hidrosadénite Phlegmoneuse&quot;. This is how HS obtained its alternate name &quot;Verneuil&#x27;s disease&quot;.
* In 1922, Schiefferdecker hypothesized a pathogenic link between &quot;acne inversa&quot; and human sweat glands.
* In 1956, Pillsbury &quot;et al&quot;. coined the term &quot;follicular occlusion triad&quot; for the common association of hidradenitis suppurativa, acne conglobata and dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. Modern clinical research still employs Pillsbury&#x27;s terminology for these conditions&#x27; descriptions.
* In 1975, Plewig and Kligman, following Pillsbury&#x27;s research path, modified the &quot;acne triad&quot;, replacing it with the &quot;acne tetrad: acne triad, plus pilonidal sinus&quot;. Plewig and Kligman&#x27;s research follows in Pillsbury&#x27;s footsteps, offering explanations of the symptoms associated with hidradenitis suppurativa.
* In 1989, Plewig and Steger&#x27;s research led them to rename hidradenitis suppurativa, calling it &quot;acne inversa&quot; – which is not still used today in medical terminology, although some individuals still use this outdated term.

A surgeon from Paris, Velpeau described an unusual inflammatory process with formation of superficial axillary, submammary, and perianal abscesses, in a series of three publications from 1833 to 1839. One of his colleagues, also located in Paris, named Verneuil, coined the term &quot;hidrosadénite phlegmoneuse&quot; about 15 years later. This name for the disease reflects the former pathogenetic model of acne inversa, which is considered inflammation of sweat glands as the primary cause of hidradenitis suppurativa. In 1922, Schiefferdecker suspected a pathogenic association between acne inversa and apocrine sweat glands. In 1956, Pillsbury postulated follicular occlusion as the cause of acne inversa, which they grouped together with acne conglobata and &quot;perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens&quot; (&quot;dissecting cellulitis of the scalp&quot;) as the &quot;acne triad&quot;. Plewig and Kligman added another element to their acne triad, pilonidal sinus. Plewig &quot;et al.&quot; noted that this new &quot;acne tetrad&quot; includes all the elements found in the original &quot;acne triad&quot;, in addition to a fourth element, pilonidal sinus. In 1989, Plewig and Steger introduced the term &quot;acne inversa&quot;, indicating a follicular source of the disease and replacing older terms such as &quot;Verneuil disease&quot;.

=== Other names ===

Hidradenitis suppurativa has been referred to by multiple names in the literature, as well as in various cultures. Some of these are also used to describe different diseases, or specific instances of this disease.
* Acne conglobata – not really a synonym – this is a similar process, but in classic acne areas of chest and back
* Acne inversa – a proposed new term which has not gained widespread favor.
* Apocrine acne – an outdated term based on the disproven concept that apocrine glands are primarily involved, though many do have apocrine gland infection
* Apocrinitis – another outdated term based on the same thesis
* Fox-den disease – a term not used in medical literature, based on the deep fox den–like sinuses
* Hidradenitis supportiva – a misspelling
* Pyodermia fistulans significa – now considered archaic
* Verneuil&#x27;s disease – recognizing the surgeon whose name is most often associated with the disorder as a result of his 1854–1865 studies

=== Histology ===

== Society and culture ==

=== Experiences of people with HS ===
HS can have a strong negative impact on people&#x27;s lives, as well as physical and mental health. People with HS often feel stigmatised and embarrassed by their condition. Many try to hide the symptoms which can lead to impaired relationships and social isolation. A multidisciplinary approach by healthcare professionals, social support networks and psychological interventions can contribute to a better quality of life.
Compared to other skin diseases, HS has one of the highest Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores.

<text>Squadron leader (Sqn Ldr or S/L) is a senior officer rank used by some air forces, with origins from the Royal Air Force. The rank is used by air forces of many countries that have historical British influence.

Squadron leader is immediately senior to flight lieutenant and immediately below wing commander. It is usually equivalent to the rank of lieutenant commander in the navy and of the rank of major in other services.

The equivalent rank in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force, Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force (until 1968) and Princess Mary&#x27;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service (until 1980) was &quot;squadron officer&quot;.

Squadron leader has also been used as a cavalry command appointment (UK) and rank (France) since at least the nineteenth century. In Argentina it is used as a command appointment by both the army&#x27;s cavalry and by the air force&#x27;s flying units. The cavalry rank of squadron leader in France is equivalent to a major, and the cavalry appointment of squadron leader in the UK generally corresponds to this rank as well.

==Canada==

The rank was used in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1920 until the 1968 unification of the Canadian Forces, when army-type rank titles were adopted. Canadian squadron leaders then became majors. In official Canadian French usage, the rank title was . However, in 2015, the insignia for Canadian air force majors reverted to two and half strips of braid in pearl grey on black.

== United Kingdom ==
===Origins===
The rank originated in the British Royal Air Force and was adopted by several other air forces which use, or used, the RAF rank system.

On 1 April 1918, the newly created RAF adopted its officer rank titles from the British Army, with Royal Naval Air Service lieutenant commanders and Royal Flying Corps majors becoming majors in the RAF. In response to the proposal that the RAF should use its own rank titles, it was suggested that the RAF might use the Royal Navy&#x27;s officer ranks, with the word &quot;air&quot; inserted before the naval rank title. For example, the rank that later became squadron leader would have been air lieutenant commander. However, the Admiralty objected to this modification of their rank titles. The rank title squadron leader was chosen as squadrons were typically led by RAF majors and the term squadron commander had been used in the Royal Naval Air Service. The rank of squadron leader was introduced in August 1919 and has been used continuously since then.

===RAF usage===
From 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919, the RAF used major as the equivalent rank to squadron leader. Royal Naval Air Service lieutenant-commanders and Royal Flying Corps majors on 31 March 1918 became RAF majors on 1 April 1918. On 31 August 1919, the RAF rank of major was superseded by squadron leader which has remained in continuous usage ever since. Promotion to squadron leader is strictly on merit, and requires the individual to be appointed to a Career Commission, which will see them remain in the RAF until retirement or voluntary resignation.

Before the Second World War, a squadron leader commanded a squadron of aircraft. Today, however, a flying squadron is usually commanded by a wing commander, with each of the two flights under a squadron leader. However, ground-operating squadrons which are sub-divisions of a wing are ordinarily commanded by a squadron leader. This includes squadrons of the RAF Regiment and University Air Squadrons.

===Insignia and command flag===
The rank insignia consists of a thin blue band on a slightly wider black band between two narrow blue bands on slightly wider black bands. This is worn on both the lower sleeves of the tunic or on the shoulders of the flying suit or the casual uniform.

Squadron leaders are the lowest ranking officers that may fly a command flag. The flag may be depicted on the officer&#x27;s aircraft or, should the squadron leader be in command, the flag may be flown from a flagpole or displayed on an official car as a car flag. If the squadron leader is in command of a numbered squadron, then the number of the squadron is also shown on the flag.

===Land forces===
In the British Household Cavalry and Royal Armoured Corps, &quot;squadron leader&quot; is the title (but not the rank) often given to the commander of a squadron (company) of armoured fighting vehicles. The squadron leader is usually a major (thus the equivalent rank to an RAF squadron leader), although in the Second World War the post was often held by a captain.

<doc id="578147" wikidata="Q745099" url="?curid=578147" title="Kyocera">
<text>is a Japanese multinational ceramics and electronics manufacturer headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. It was founded as in 1959 by Kazuo Inamori and renamed in 1982. It manufactures industrial ceramics, solar power generating systems, telecommunications equipment, office document imaging equipment, electronic components, semiconductor packages, cutting tools, and components for medical and dental implant systems.

==History==

===Origins to 2000===
Kyocera&#x27;s original product was a ceramic insulator known as a &quot;kelcima&quot; for use in cathode-ray tubes. The company quickly adapted its technologies to produce an expanding range of ceramic components for electronic and structural applications. In the 1960s, as the NASA space program, the birth of Silicon Valley and the advancement of computer technology created demand for semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs), Kyocera developed ceramic semiconductor packages that remain among its core product lines.

In the mid-1970s, Kyocera began expanding its material technologies to produce a diverse range of applied ceramic products, including solar photovoltaic modules; biocompatible tooth- and joint-replacement systems; industrial cutting tools; consumer ceramics, such as ceramic-bladed kitchen knives and ceramic-tipped ballpoint pens; and lab-grown gemstones, including rubies, emeralds, sapphires, opals, alexandrites and padparadschahs.

The company acquired electronic equipment manufacturing and radio communication technologies in 1979 through an investment in Cybernet Electronics Corporation, which was merged into Kyocera in 1982. Shortly afterward, Kyocera introduced one of the first portable, battery-powered laptop computers, sold in the U.S. as the Tandy Model 100, which featured an LCD screen and telephone-modem data transfer capability.

Kyocera gained optical technology by acquiring Yashica in 1983, along with Yashica&#x27;s prior licensing agreement with Carl Zeiss, and manufactured film and digital cameras under the Kyocera, Yashica and Contax trade names until 2005, when the company discontinued all film and digital camera production.

In the 1980s, Kyocera marketed audio components, such as CD players, receivers, turntables, and cassette decks. These featured unique elements, including Kyocera ceramic-based platforms. At one time, Kyocera owned the famous KLH brand founded by Henry Kloss, though Kloss and the original Cambridge design and engineering staff had left the company by the time of the Kyocera purchase. In 1989, Kyocera stopped production of audio components and sought a buyer for the KLH brand.

In 1989, Kyocera acquired Elco Corporation, a manufacturer of electronic connectors. In 1990, Kyocera&#x27;s global operations expanded significantly with the addition of AVX Corporation, a global manufacturer of passive electronic components, such as ceramic chip capacitors, filters and voltage suppressors.

Expanding sales of photovoltaic solar energy products led the company to create Kyocera Solar Corporation in Japan in 1996, and Kyocera Solar, Inc. in the U.S. in 1999.

On August 4, 1999, Kyocera completed its merger with solar energy systems integrator Golden Genesis Company (Nasdaq:GGGO).

===Since 2000===

In January 2000, Kyocera acquired photocopier manufacturer Mita Industrial Company, following Mita&#x27;s decline and bankruptcy in the late 1990s. This resulted in the creation of Kyocera Mita Corporation (now Kyocera Document Solutions Corporation), headquartered in Osaka, Japan, with subsidiaries in more than 25 nations.

Also in 2000, Kyocera acquired the mobile phone manufacturing operations of Qualcomm Incorporated to form Kyocera Wireless Corp. In 2003, Kyocera Wireless Corp. established Kyocera Wireless India (KWI), a mobile phone subsidiary in Bangalore. KWI has established alliances with several leading players providing CDMA services in India. Kyocera Wireless Corporation was the first to combine BREW capabilities and enhanced brilliant Color displays on entry-level CDMA Handsets, when it demonstrated BREW-enabled handsets at the BREW 2003 Developers Conference.

In 2008, Kyocera acquired Sanyo Mobile, the mobile phone division of Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., and its associated operations in Japan, the United States and Canada.

In April 2009, Kyocera unveiled its EOS concept phone at CTIA, with an OLED and which is powered by kinetic energy from the user. The prototype phone also has a foldable design which is capable of morphing into a variety of shapes.

In 2009 Kyocera sold its Indian R&amp;D Division (Wireless) to Mindtree Limited.

In March 2010, Kyocera launched its first Smartphone (Zio) since 2001, after focusing on lower cost phones.

In March, 2010, Kyocera announced the merger of its two wholly owned subsidiaries: San Diego–based Kyocera Wireless Corp. and Kyocera Communications, Inc. The merged enterprise continued under the name Kyocera Communications, Inc. Later that month, Kyocera agreed to acquire part of the thin film transistor (TFT) liquid crystal display (LCD) design and manufacturing business of Sony Corporation&#x27;s subsidiary Sony Mobile Display Corporation.

In October 2010, Kyocera acquired 100% ownership of the shares of TA Triumph-Adler AG (Nuremberg, Germany) and converted the daughter company into TA Triumph-Adler GmbH. TA Triumph-Adler GmbH currently distributes Kyocera-made printing devices and software with TA Triumph-Adler and UTAX trademarks within the EMEA (Europe-Middle East-Africa) region. TA Triumph-Adler GmbH is located in Nuremberg, Germany and UTAX GmbH (subsidiary of TA Triumph-Adler) in Norderstedt, Germany.

In July 2011, Kyocera&#x27;s wholly owned Germany-based subsidiary Kyocera Fineceramics GmbH acquired 100% ownership of the shares in Denmark-based industrial cutting tool manufacturing and sales company Unimerco Group A/S. Unimerco had been founded in Denmark in 1964. Today, the subsidiary is known as Kyocera Unimerco A/S, and comprises a tooling division and fastening division.

In February 2012, Kyocera became the total stock holder of Optrex Corporation, which was subsequently renamed Kyocera Display Corporation.

In March 2016, Kyocera acquired an international cutting tool company called SGS Tool Company for $89 million.

In August 2017, Kyocera acquired 100% ownership of Senco Industrial Tools.

In November, 2020, Kyocera acquired a light source company called SLD laser. The company innovated a product that uses phosphor to convert blue laser light to produce a broad-spectrum, incoherent, high luminance white light source.

==Main products==

===Printers and multi-function devices===

Kyocera Document Solutions Corporation manufactures a wide range of printers, MFPs. and toner cartridges which are sold throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia and the Americas. Kyocera printing devices are also marketed under the Copystar name in Americas and under TA Triumph-Adler and Utax names in EMEA (Europe-Middle East-Africa) region. This division is overseen by Aaron Thomas (North American division President), Henry Goode, and Adam Stevens

===Satellite phones===
In the past, Kyocera manufactured satellite phones for the Iridium network. Three handsets were released in 1999 including one with an unusual docking station which contained the Iridium transceiver and antenna, as well as a pager for the Iridium network.

===Mobile phones===
====North America (Kyocera International, Inc.)====

Kyocera manufactures mobile phones for wireless carriers in the United States and Canada. Marketing is done by its subsidiary Kyocera International, Inc.

Kyocera acquired the terminal business of US digital communications technology company Qualcomm in February 2000, and became a major supplier of mobile handsets. In 2008, Kyocera also took over the handset business of Sanyo, eventually forming &#x27;Kyocera Communications, Inc.&#x27;. The Kyocera Communications terminal division is located in San Diego.

====Japan====
Kyocera Corporation manufactures and markets phones for the Japanese market which are sold under different brands. Kyocera makes phones for some Japanese wireless carriers including au, willcom, SoftBank and Y!mobile.

In May 2012, Kyocera released the world&#x27;s first speaker-less smartphone, the &quot;Kyocera Urbano Progresso.&quot; This phone produces vibration to conduct sound through the ear canal instead of the customary speaker, making it easier to hear phone conversations in busy and noisy places. This also benefits those who are having difficulty hearing, but are not totally deaf. It could be used across the world on CDMA, GSM, GPRS and UMTS networks. This phone was only available in Japan.

===Solar cells===

Kyocera maintains production bases for photovoltaic cells and solar modules in Japan and China. In 2009, it was announced that Kyocera&#x27;s solar modules were available as on option on the Toyota Prius.

The company also operates solar power plants, such as the Kagoshima Nanatsujima Mega Solar Power Plant.

===Advanced ceramics===

Kyocera sells ceramic knives via its web store and retail outlets under the name Kyocera Advanced Ceramics.

==Corporate affairs==
Kyocera&#x27;s headquarters building in Kyoto is tall. A 1,900-panel photovoltaic power system is on the roof and south wall of the building, which can supply 12.5% of the facility&#x27;s needed energy, generating 182 megawatt hours per year.

== Sponsorships ==

Between 1978 and 1998, Kyocera and the International Affairs Board of the City of San Diego sponsored an all-expense paid tour of Japan for students from the United States called HORIZON (stylized in all capital letters and designated by year: e.g. HORIZON &#x27;98). The program&#x27;s purpose was to acquaint these students with the Japanese people and their culture, and to facilitate friendship and understanding. The program was open to students ages 10–14; applicants were chosen randomly.

The brand Mita was the first main sponsor of the Argentine team Atlético Independiente, from 1985 to 1992. Mita also sponsored English club Aston Villa F.C., appearing on shirt fronts from 1984 to 1993, and Italian club Como 1907 from 1983 to 1989. Between 2005 and 2008, Kyocera also sponsored Reading F.C. and Brazilian football team Atlético Paranaense, having the naming rights of their stadium.

Kyocera is currently the sponsor of the football club Kyoto Sanga F.C. of the J-League (its hometown team; here the word &quot;Kyocera&quot; is written in Japanese katakana, everywhere else in the Latinized logo). Kyocera holds the naming rights for the Kyocera Dome Osaka, colloquially known as Osaka Dome. The indoor dome is the home field of the baseball teams Orix Buffaloes and Hanshin Tigers.

<doc id="578150" wikidata="Q898559" url="?curid=578150" title="Standard hydrogen electrode">
<text>In electrochemistry, the standard hydrogen electrode (abbreviated SHE), is a redox electrode which forms the basis of the thermodynamic scale of oxidation-reduction potentials. Its absolute electrode potential is estimated to be at 25 °C, but to form a basis for comparison with all other electrochemical reactions, hydrogen&#x27;s standard electrode potential () is declared to be zero volts at any temperature. Potentials of all other electrodes are compared with that of the standard hydrogen electrode at the same temperature.

== Nernst equation for SHE ==

The hydrogen electrode is based on the redox half cell corresponding to the reduction of two hydrated protons, into one gaseous hydrogen molecule, 

General equation for a reduction reaction: 
: formula_1

The reaction quotient () of the half-reaction is the ratio between the chemical activities () of the reduced form (the reductant, ) and the oxidized form (the oxidant, ). 

: formula_2

Considering the redox couple:

: &lt;chem&gt;2H_{(aq)}+ + 2e- &lt;=&gt; H2_{(g)}&lt;/chem&gt;

at chemical equilibrium, the ratio of the reaction products by the reagents is equal to the equilibrium constant of the half-reaction: 

: formula_3

where
*formula_4 and formula_5 correspond to the chemical activities of the reduced and oxidized species involved in the redox reaction
*formula_6 represents the activity of . 
*formula_7 denotes the chemical activity of gaseous hydrogen (), which is approximated here by its fugacity formula_8
*formula_9 denotes the partial pressure of gaseous hydrogen, expressed without unit; formula_10 where
**formula_11 is the mole fraction 
**formula_12 is the total gas pressure in the system 
* is the standard pressure (1 bar = 10 pascal) introduced here simply to overcome the pressure unit and to obtain an equilibrium constant without unit. 
More details on managing gas fugacity to get rid of the pressure unit in thermodynamic calculations can be found at thermodynamic activity#Gases. The followed approach is the same as for chemical activity and molar concentration of solutes in solution. In the SHE, pure hydrogen gas (formula_13) at the standard pressure formula_12 of is engaged in the system. Meanwhile the general SHE equation can also be applied to other thermodynamic systems with different mole fraction or total pressure of hydrogen. 

This redox reaction occurs at a platinized platinum electrode.
The electrode is immersed in the acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled over its surface. The concentration of both the reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen are maintained at unity. That implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is 1 bar (100 kPa) and the activity coefficient of hydrogen ions in the solution is unity. The activity of hydrogen ions is their effective concentration, which is equal to the formal concentration times the activity coefficient. These unit-less activity coefficients are close to 1.00 for very dilute water solutions, but usually lower for more concentrated solutions. 

As the general form of the Nernst equation at equilibrium is the following: 

formula_15

and as formula_16 by definition in the case of the SHE, 

The Nernst equation for the SHE becomes:

:formula_17

:formula_18

Simply neglecting the pressure unit present in formula_9, this last equation can often be directly written as: 

:formula_20

And by solving the numerical values for the term 
:formula_21
the practical formula commonly used in the calculations of this Nernst equation is:
:formula_22 (unit: volt)

As under standard conditions formula_23 formula_24 the equation simplifies to: 

:formula_25 (unit: volt)

This last equation describes the straight line with a negative slope of -0.0591 volt/ pH unit delimiting the lower stability region of water in a Pourbaix diagram where gaseous hydrogen is evolving because of water decomposition. 

where:
* is the activity of the hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution, formula_26 with:
** is the activity coefficient of hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution
** is the molar concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution
** is the standard concentration (1 M) used to overcome concentration unit
* is the partial pressure of the hydrogen gas, in bar ()
* is the universal gas constant: J⋅K−1⋅mol−1 (rounded here to 4 decimal)
* is the absolute temperature, in kelvin (at 25 °C: 298.15 K)
* is the Faraday constant (the charge per mole of electrons), equal to 
* is the standard pressure: 

: as the system is at chemical equilibrium, hydrogen gas, is also in equilibrium with dissolved hydrogen, and the Nernst equation implicitly takes into account the Henry&#x27;s law for gas dissolution. Therefore, there is no need to independently consider the gas dissolution process in the system, as it is already &quot;de facto&quot; included.

==SHE vs NHE vs RHE==
During the early development of electrochemistry, researchers used the normal hydrogen electrode as their standard for zero potential. This was convenient because it could &quot;actually be constructed&quot; by &quot;[immersing] a platinum electrode into a solution of 1 N strong acid and [bubbling] hydrogen gas through the solution at about 1 atm pressure&quot;. However, this electrode/solution interface was later changed. What replaced it was a theoretical electrode/solution interface, where the concentration of H+ was 1 M, but the H+ ions were assumed to have no interaction with other ions (a condition not physically attainable at those concentrations). To differentiate this new standard from the previous one, it was given the name &#x27;standard hydrogen electrode&#x27;.
 Finally, there are also reversible hydrogen electrodes (RHEs), which are practical hydrogen electrodes whose potential depends on the pH of the solution.
In summary,

:NHE (normal hydrogen electrode): potential of a platinum electrode in 1 M acid solution with 1 bar of hydrogen bubbled through

:SHE (standard hydrogen electrode): potential of a platinum electrode in a theoretical ideal solution (the current &quot;standard&quot; for zero potential for all temperatures)

:RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode): a practical hydrogen electrode whose potential depends on the pH of the solution

==Choice of platinum==
The choice of platinum for the hydrogen electrode is due to several factors:
* inertness of platinum (it does not corrode)
* the capability of platinum to catalyze the reaction of proton reduction
* a high intrinsic exchange current density for proton reduction on platinum
* excellent reproducibility of the potential (bias of less than 10 μV when two well-made hydrogen electrodes are compared with one another)
The surface of platinum is platinized (i.e., covered with a layer of fine powdered platinum also known as platinum black) to:
* Increase total surface area. This improves reaction kinetics and maximum possible current
* Use a surface material that adsorbs hydrogen well at its interface. This also improves reaction kinetics

Other metals can be used for fabricating electrodes with a similar function such as the palladium-hydrogen electrode.

==Interference==
Because of the high adsorption activity of the platinized platinum electrode, it&#x27;s very important to protect electrode surface and solution from the presence of organic substances as well as from atmospheric oxygen. Inorganic ions that can be reduced to a lower valency state at the electrode also have to be avoided (e.g., , ). A number of organic substances are also reduced by hydrogen on a platinum surface, and these also have to be avoided.

Cations that can be reduced and deposited on the platinum can be source of interference: silver, mercury, copper, lead, cadmium and thallium.

Substances that can inactivate (&quot;poison&quot;) the catalytic sites include arsenic, sulfides and other sulfur compounds, colloidal substances, alkaloids, and material found in biological systems.

==Isotopic effect==
The standard redox potential of the deuterium couple is slightly different from that of the proton couple (ca. −0.0044 V vs SHE). Various values in this range have been obtained: −0.0061 V, −0.00431 V, −0.0074 V.

:&lt;chem&gt;2 D_{(aq)}+ + 2 e- -&gt; D2_{(g)}&lt;/chem&gt;

Also difference occurs when hydrogen deuteride (HD, or deuterated hydrogen, DH) is used instead of hydrogen in the electrode.

==Experimental setup==
The scheme of the standard hydrogen electrode:

# platinized platinum electrode
# hydrogen gas
# solution of the acid with activity of H+ = 1 mol dm−3
# hydroseal for preventing oxygen interference
# reservoir through which the second half-element of the galvanic cell should be attached. The connection can be direct, through a narrow tube to reduce mixing, or through a salt bridge, depending on the other electrode and solution. This creates an ionically conductive path to the working electrode of interest.

<text>Tariq Anwar (born 16 January 1951) is an Indian politician from the Indian National Congress (INC), and a Member of Parliament representing Katihar (Lok Sabha constituency) in Bihar, India. He served as the Minister of State of Agriculture and Food Processing Industries between 2012 and 2014.

Anwar has been a member of the Indian Parliament for more than three decades – elected six times to the Lok Sabha, the lower house, from Katihar, and two times to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house, from Maharashtra. He quit the INC over a presidency dispute of the party in 1999 and formed the Nationalist Congress Party along with Sharad Pawar and P. A. Sangma, before resigning 19 years after, and re-joining the INC in 2018. Anwar has been appointed both general secretary in charge of poll-bound Kerala and a member of the Congress Working Committee (CWC).

== Early life ==
Tariq Anwar was born as Shah Tariq Anwar to Shah Mushtaque Ahmad, former Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly from the Sikandra Assembly constituency and Bilquis Jahan on 16 January 1951 in Arwal, Bihar.

He is grandson of the Shah Mohammad Zubair, a freedom fighter. Brothers of his grandfather were Shah Mohammad Umair, Shah Zohair. His grandfather is known to be the maker of Shri Krishna Sinha.

He has a B.Sc degree from Magadh University, Bodh Gaya, Bihar.

== Career ==
Anwar joined the Indian National Congress in 1972. His political career began a student leader. He contested his first Lok Sabha election from Katihar on a Congress ticket in 1977 which he lost before winning three year later. He has been the national president of Indian Youth Congress. In 1989, he was offered the post of the minister of finance in the government of Bihar, headed by Satyendra Narayan Sinha.

In May 1999, Anwar along with other leaders of the INC, Sharad Pawar and P. A. Sangma, rebelled against a foreign-origin Sonia Gandhi being chosen as the party&#x27;s Prime Minister-candidate ahead of the general election. In an open letter, they questioned her &quot;experience and understanding of public life&quot; in being able to rule a country &quot;with a population of 980 million&quot;. A few days later, they were expelled from the party&#x27;s prime membership for six years. They later quit the party and formed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). However, the NCP chose to support the INC-led United Progressive Alliance for two terms at the centre between 2004 and 2014. In October 2012, Anwar was appointed Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Processing. During the time, he served as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, representing Maharashtra.

In September 2018, he resigned from the NCP over colleague Pawar&#x27;s clean chit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rafale deal controversy, and re-joined the INC the following month.
